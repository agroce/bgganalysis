RATING: 5
Neat dice drafting game where the objective is laying dice that neither math color nor number to it's orthogonal neighbors. An interesting spatial puzzle that I find enjoyable in terms of the public goals and getting everything to fit on your board. At 4p you see all of the dice come out, while at 2p, the game is much faster (and largely doesn't change the risk calculation). Two areas that I am annoyed by is I find the tools to be somewhat hit or miss; you either need them and end up blowing your extra points on them or you never care. Second, the private goals are essentially a crap shoot; at 2 and 3, you may not see the dice you need and at 4, you may get lame rolls so the pip counter never really advances your cause. I actually think I would find the game more interesting without the private goals at all, or if they were nerfed in some manner. High 5 or low 6. I wouldn't turn down a 2p game of it as a filler at game night, but I won't buy it.

One of my favorites as a two-player game. Slowed down a bit with 4 and we had trouble with the tiny dice getting knocked around by careless fingers. It's currently the main go-to game for my wife and me on game night.

[I]tl;dr - Sagrada was a real hype-buster for me, the game feels very repetitive, very quickly, and the puzzle is interesting but the tools and differing goals don't have as much of an impact as I'd thought they would.[/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

I appreciate the puzzles of this game, and the decisions of where to put your dice where feel very important. I'm concerned about the longevity, though, and tools don't have as much of an impact as I'd have thought. 

Also, it feels disappointing that despite specializing, our scores have tended to mostly go in lock-step on the public objectives, with whoever does the best on their private objective taking the crown. It's important to counter-draft against people, but often that's not a possibility (or relatively hurts you more than it hurts them). 

The puzzle-like nature of the dice is interesting, but not enough to keep me coming back. Also, the game is not tight enough: because everyone can pursue all of the scoring goals, scores often vary by a single point or so, and it feels like whoever gets the most 6s in their private objective color wins the game. 

Fun, but not really attention-grabbing. I may play again, but I'd be fine not to.

Really nice puzzle game.  A tiny bit of luck, but mostly skill.  The fewer players, the more luck there is.  Tried a 1p, 2p and 4p.  Best at 4p in my opinion.

As much as I do enjoy this game, you get WAY too many points from your hidden objective card.

Dice drafting game, very easy to explain and quick to play (20min 2player, 60min 4player)  Had a lot of fun, and there seems to be plenty of replayability and a fair amount of depth.   Roll Player Lite, in a good way.  Not infinite consequences to each die placement and very streamlined.  And pretty.

Components are excellent, as well.  Very happy with this as an impulse buy, looking forward to playing with family as well as gaming groups.

After playing 4 times, the game is still very accessible and goes over well with non-gamers, but also has a good depth for gamers.  Great weight/depth for a short game, I'm always left wanting to play another round.

After 10 plays, this can be very thinky and a rough puzzle with 4 players, aa your options are very limited at the end of the game and you are more impacted by luck of the draw, but still an awesome game!

It is a good filler, with enough tactical decisions to make, reminds me of Blueprint, but better implemented. It feels in the same niche as Splendor, but I think Splendor is a better game overall.

The game itself is very simple and the theme chosen fits very well with the proposal of this game.

The production quality here is impressive and artwork is amazing. It is a good game, but not great.

A lot of fun. Played 3 times, lost as many times and still love the game. Bit of a brain-teaser (which I'm not normally a fan of) and as much player interaction as your group would like. 

Want to ignore what other players are doing and focus on your own window? Fine. Want to screw up your opponents' chances of winning as much as possible? Also fine (of course with some limits).

A neat little dice drafting and placement game that is very simple to teach and learn. While it does look pretty when you have all of the dice placed in your window frame, the theme is really non-existent. Calling numbers "shades" is extremely confusing when you're dealing with a colour-based game. Just call them numbers; you're not shattering the illusion of building stained glass windows because you never feel it.

Finally with a bit of frustration from previous game and wanting to do better you play it again, and again.. and again. Fantastic game components for a game that is simple, always new and good looking. Not a 10 because i don't enjoy dices too much

In Sagrada players build a stained glass window masterpiece by building up a grid of dice on their player board. Each board has some restrictions on which color or die value can be placed. Dice are drafted in player order, with the start player rotating each round, snaking back around after the last player drafts 2 dice. Special tools can be used to help you break the rules by spending skill tokens -- however, once a tool is used, it then requires more skill tokens for the next player to use them. Scoring is variable per game based on achieving various patterns and varieties of placement... as well as varying bonus points. The highest scoring window artisan is the winner!

I admit, Sagrada was an impulse purchase. I thought it was pretty. This is what ya get when girls play boardgames LOL! Thankfully, it's a solid game with simple mechanics and thoughtful strategy. This falls into the category of puzzle games - kinda like Blokus or Patchwork. You have a limited choice of pieces (dice in this case) and you must place as many dice as you can on your own player grid, while following placement restrictions. There are favor tokens that you can spend to help you throughout the game. It consists of 10 rounds of dice-drafting, so it is fairly quick. It scales nicely as well, since you simply roll less dice for less players. I'll always play when presented with opportunity. 8/10.

This is becoming a go-to game just simply because of its ease of play and absolutely stunning components.

Plays so effortlessly and thinky but not exasperating.

The only downside is the dice are a wee bit small for my sausage fingers and the score track is like an LSD hippies dream making it hard to score and probably the worst score track ever!

Those two are minor gripes though and can be lived with when everything else about this game hits the sweet spots

RATING: 4
Played 2-player game. Cool idea for a game in the same vein as Patchwork, drafting from a common pool to complete a geometric pattern on one's own board. But Sagrada greatly suffers in comparison.

The spatial play isn't interesting, because the limitations aren't particularly limiting, and you can always get out of a jam with a tool card . The scoring is wacky, because the largest deltas in score typically come from the private goal card, which is heavily affected by the luck of the dice that come out of the bag and what they roll. The connection between incentivized play and aesthetic beauty is undermined by the tool cards. Finally, it's only nod to an economy is the stones you can cash in for tool cards.

You might notice that most of these issues are with the tool cards. I think they could be completely excised from the game and it would be improved. Also, having all of the to-be-drafted dice visible from the beginning of the game would add some real interest to the forward planning. Visible private goal cards would probably reduce the likelihood of their deltas being too great. With those changes, this could be a decent game.

I enjoy Sagrada quite a bit despite the fact that most games of it feel very similar. While every play has different public objectives, they're all "get the most of this combination" or "use one of everything". The "different" private objectives are functionally identical - get as much of a color whenever possible. The tools are really neat and I think these provide the most variety from game to game. Some will allow you to adjust the pip value of a die, while others let you slide dice around your board (sometimes even allowing you to break placement restrictions).

In the end, 90% of each game is functionally the same puzzle (place dice, get the most objectives) with a different fake mustache on. And that's okay. Sagrada is good at what it does and I really enjoy the game quite a bit. It's easy to teach, fast to play, and a very pleasant experience while playing. I expect to play it into the fifties of times eventually. Sagrada doesn't really break any paradigms and won't change the world of board gaming, but that's fine. It didn't have to.

RATING: 9.5
This game is quick, fun, and great looking. Themed around the famous "Sagrada Familia", players each have their own stained glass window to build. They do this by drafting translucent colored die and placing them next to die on their boards. There are a couple rules to this though; two of the same value can't touch, and two of the same color can't touch. Each board also has certain spots designated as a certain value or color. Players have 3 common objectives that score points and 1 secret color for which they get points for all pips on die of that color in their board. 

There is a lot that I like about this game, and once I have played with more than 2, if it is just as good that way my rating will likely go up even more. 

First, the components are great! Each players board is nice and thick, and has a slot to put the different board cards into for variability. Also, the dice each have their own slot so there is no fear of jostling ruining your game. The dice are simple but look great and really make your board pop out at the end and look like you've truly made your very own stained glass window.

Second, the gameplay is engaging and has just enough interaction for a game that is very puzzle-y. Players do a snake draft for the die and sometimes players will take that one die you really needed, but there are tool cards players can use to help mitigate this. It really does feel like a puzzle that is interesting, without being brain-burning or AP inducing. It's almost like a game of sudoku using numbers and colors, and the different possible goals give that extra guidance to really make you try to be somewhat optimal. 

Lastly, the game does just enough rules-wise and in play-length without overstaying it's welcome on either account. I really have to applaud the designer for this. It takes a solid half-hour and maybe five minutes to teach. Honestly, I can't think of another game (for me personally) that gives me a better feeling of playing a full, fleshed out game, and having it clock in at 30-40 minutes. The first couple of times I felt like I had played a solid hour game, but really it took the two of us about 25 minutes!

I'm excited to try this with more players, but for the time being it is still an excellent game.

I played Eric's copy of this game and I really enjoyed it! It is different enough from Roll Player that I think I would like to have it as well. They would fill 2 different and yet still important spots because of how they appeal to different people by their themes.

The game is gorgeous to look at and I really enjoyed the puzzle of where to put the dice. I played with an easier window (3 difficulty) and a harder one (4 difficulty) and I actually preferred the more difficult one because I enjoyed trying to stay within the restrictions.

This takes the "roll and write" formula (roll dice, fill out spaces while keeping other spaces open for future rolls), but actually makes it into a  compelling, more strategic game. The special actions add a bit of dice manipulation, and the drafting mechanic means you're not necessarily stuck with a single roll. Plus, you don't have to use up paper to play it! With this and Roll Player released last year, I am really digging this new genre of dice game.

Nice clean design; quick and smooth playing, with only a smidgin of chrome in the form of the 'tools'. Remind me of 'Roll Player', which is a bit more complex mechanically, though this is slicker and shorter.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Really nice dice-drafting puzzle game that is surprisingly "thinky" where you work with the randomness of the dice to "solve" your window pattern by trying to maximize your victory points from the game's objective cards using your tools (special action that can help you manipulate your dice).
++ The theme is still pretty well implemented for a somewhat abstract game.
++ Great replayability coming from several different window pattern cards, several different objective cards (of which only 3 are used in each game), and of course the way the dice are rolled (different color dice draw from the bag and different value value all the time). It's surprising how a different combinaison of public objectif cards and tools can change a game.
++ Great components: The player boards are great, with recess spots for the dice and with a nice glossy finish; the dices are great looking; the dice pouch is beautiful and the glass tokens are nice. These component really give this game a nice table presence and a nice tactile feel.
++ The solo game is really fun and challenging. It's a simple twist from the original game (not too much of rule changes) and offer a great quick and thinky solo filler game. It can take a few game to get use to it, as you control both your score and the target score to beat, but this is so much more fun than just achieving a certain score to get a ranking (anyway, your score would change a lot according to the available objectives, as some are more easily done than others).
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (and that still offer some spare room for more!).
++ Fun, easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play game.
++ An expansion is in the work.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- It's a tiny bit more luck-driven than I love, as at lower player count, you won't see all the dice colors equally, depending on the draw, so sometimes you are desperately waiting for a certain color that may never show up again late in a 2-player game (as we only see 50 out of the 90 dice in any game). A BGG user suggested to scale the dice according to the player count (so 10 dice of each color in a 2-player game), and I'll try that variant as it should correct this problem.
-- This is less true for 2-players games, which is the best player count IMO, but it's sometimes hard to closely monitor exactly what your opponents are needing exactly (so it's may feel mostly multiplayer solitaire for some as there will be less "hate drafting", but this doesn't bother me much).
-- The solo mode as per the rules is too hard without any tweaks. I thus currently play with a simple but efficient HOUSE-RULE (SOLO MODE): Take Favor tokens equal to the difficulty level of the window pattern divided by 2 (rounded up). These Favor token can be spent to re-draw and re-roll all the dice you just took from the dice bag (this limit the bad draws, especially late in the game where sometimes the dice drawn cannot be place at all so you lose a lot of points while the target score increase a lot because you may be adding 3 or even 4 dice to the track).

Great graphic design, but not much game. Strategy is fairly trivial. Drafting makes it a bit tedious. Abstract. In the same general family as Take it Easy or Karuba, but there is no reason to play this instead of Take it Easy in its several incarnations.

Sagrada is a quick, decently fun little puzzle game of drafting and placing dice into a grid, having to obey a few simple rules for placement that make it challenging to both place the dice and efficiently score points.

How you want to place them into your grid will vary from game to game depending on three random scoring cards that are flipped at the beginning of the game, as well as one personal scoring card unique to each player. Some games, you might be trying to collect 1's and 2's, while also making columns of all different colors, while also making diagonal chains of the same color, while also collecting as many green pips as possible, while you'll likely get a completely different mix of requirements in the next game.

Overall, nothing outstanding, other than being really pretty, but neat if you're up for a neat little drafting puzzle game.

Beautiful little dice drafting game that plays a lot like Roll Player. Components are very well made and the translucent colored dice really bring out the stained glass theme.

I might be over-egging the pudding with how much I liked this one, but it hit a bone for me, and I immediately wanted to add it to my already overfull collection.  I enjoyed how the dice worked. I liked that you could do some nasty moves to mess someone over.  I like the variable powers, and the variable scoring (a la Isle of Skye, and Kingdom Builder).  I liked the theme.  It wasn't space, zombies, fantasy, or even Power Grid, but I still loved this game about making stained glass windows, especially how the pretty dice aided that theme along.  This was a winner for me.  I hope to own, and get to enjoy it even more.

Only played solo so far. It was a fun puzzly experience. I'm looking forward to both playing harder windows and also trying it out with opponents.

A minor complaint is the pips on the dice. I would prefer if they weren't all white, but instead shaded from white to black, or light to dark of the die color, to better signify the shades. I think now having all the pips white messes up the shading mechanic a bit. Not a dealbreaker, and maybe they'll come out with a deluxe set of dice someday.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow this came out of nowhere to me. I don't really pay much attention to KS games so when a friend busted this out I'd never even heard of it. This is killer filler, right here. Lots of juicy little decisions, some fun passive-aggressive denial aspects, randomization for replayability, and of course: dat playtime.

There's a noticeable luck factor during the endgame, but since you can set yourself up for greater flexibility toward the end it's not a dealbreaker for me. All around good stuff.

So far I've only played it with two and honestly I suspect it's best as a one-on-one. The denial aspect is really strong in a way that it just can't be with more. Still, though, I'd be happy to play with any number. I will DEFINITELY be picking up a copy once it's widely available.

A nearly solitaire puzzle experience. But knowing that is what you are in for, I think it is fun. I just think it is inferior to Rolling America or Japan because everyone is dealing with the exact same board and rolls (and therefore puzzle) in that game. Here, all of the boards are different, and objectives are different. How the dice come, and how what you need is aligned with others probably rules the day.

A quick dice drafter that looks great on the table and has some tough decisions for the time it plays in. There is a good amount of variability in the tool cards, objectives, and windows you can build in every game which will certainly make the game play out differently each time. I will say the game can get rather vicious towards the end with the potential for hate drafting but it plays so fast it doesn't bother me. I want to try it again as I could see my wife enjoying it as well as try out the solo mode since it is more than just beat your own score you have an opponent to beat as well which is great.

I really enjoy dice placement games that allow you to mitigate luck with die face-turning powers. "Sagrada" is one of the cleverer examples of these types of games. The possibilities are endless at the game's start, but as your window pane fills up with dice, things get tighter and tighter. It reminds me of the excellent "Azul" in that regard.

Sagrada is a gorgeous puzzle that plays at a fast pace. The game has a really nice tranquil feel for those gaming sessions where you don't want any real conflict. I enjoy how the objective cards reward points because you will do so much better if you consider them instead of just placing what fits meaning that the decisions you make are very meaningful. Recommended.

RATING: 9
very fun light dice drafting game. Feels like sudoku, you will try to figure out 5x5 grid to create most beautiful window (read to score the most points according to current objectives and your hidden objective).
Dice placement has several restrictions (which differs based on the player board you choose) so it is a puzzle to pick the optimal dice, to choose a place to put it on and to decide whether a tool should be used for different effect.
I am not stunned by the visual beauty of the game as most other people - what I see is just colored dice on (OK, very nice) window like board. But it doesn't mean I am not excited for the game alone. It seems I really enjoy the lighter family games to be played under 30 minutes and this game is no exception and very quickly become a staple on our game table.

What I like:
- Dice drafting and placement. The placement restrictions are really easy to grasp, but are cleverly designed and it resulted in a light brain-burny style of puzzle game which is somehow thinky yet very lighthearted and friendly. 
- I like the optimization of every single move, when you try to fill the most problematic places and keep so much options for future rounds as able. Also working with different public objectives adds another layer to this puzzle, really appreciate this.
- I like the theme of the game and its implementation in otherwise abstract themeless game. The visual aspect along with the theme does its job in promoting this game

What I dislike:
- Despite of existing solo variant, this game mode is very luck dependant (depends on goals and dice throws much more than multiplayer game). But this game is really not solo game, the solo option is just a welcomed addition (and I still enjoy it from time to time, its quicker than multiplayer games)
- I would like to see more public objective cards, maybe some interesting tools (hopefully these will be added in future expansion)
- This is really a small game, I don't see the point of having this big box (aside of nice functional insert). The game would fit in half sized box.

RATING: 7
Abstract game in which 6-sided dice of 5 different colours have to be placed on a roster in which some spaces indicate which colour or which number has to be placed there. Other spaces are open, but no 2 orthogonally placed dice may be of the same colour or bear the same number. Every die also has to be placed adjacent to one already on the roster (except for the first of course). Each player has his own roster and gets his own secret scoring rule, next to three scoring rules shared by all the players. There are also three cards which enable the players to bend the general rules by paying with 1 or 2 points. The number of points you can use for such an action is determined at the start of the game. It depends on the difficulty level of the chosen roster.

Nice quick dice drafting game that looks good on the table.  There is some contention about the secret goals being way too powerful but it seems like the house rule of pips/2 is a good fix.   To me, that screams "Indie publisher!  Underdeveloped!" but whatever.   The game can be a bit frustrating as you paint yourself into corners and depend on a lot of luck in the late game.   There is also a bit more Sudoku in here than I expected.   Would be nice if this were more readily available.

Excellent game! Best description I can give it is "frustratingly fun". Hits a sweet spot between  puzzle and brain-burner. Good flow with very little down time. Great play time!

Most of the components are top notch. The window player boards are awesome and feel like they could stop a bullet, but I found the cards to be unusually flimsy especially compared to the quality and thickness of the player boards..

Dice drafting and placement that feels more like a puzzle than a game (very little interaction). Looks great, accessible, yet challenging. However, I prefer Roll Player because you have more chances to trigger special powers/abilities and there are more ways to score points and more things to play around with.

Excellent game. There is a certain amount of "luck," with what is rolled, but there's also a ton of strategy. This game is essentially an optimization problem - how can I keep my options the most open throughout the course of the game, and save the tools for when I really need them? 

NOTE: I really think this game *only* works when you halve the private objectives (one point for every two pips on your own color dice). The private objectives are the swingiest part of the game - I would much prefer that they have a slightly weaker value compared to the public objectives than a greater value.

Sagrada is a dice drafting game that is attractive, puzzley, and relatively quick d6 dice drafting euro. Each player has a grid, where certain spots need a specific number and others a specific colour. The rub is that you can't place the same colours or numbers orthogonality adjacent to one another. So, near the end of the game, placement can get difficult. The game alleviates this issue with some cards that allow you to break the rules of the game. You spend resources to do so. Each player has a personal goal and there are public pattern and set collection goals to try an achieve. There are 2 main problems with the game: you can gain too many points from your private objective. The private objective is collect a specific coloured die and gain points equal to the pips. These points can outweigh anything else in the game. The second problem is that, the number of dice in the bag doesn't scale based on the number of players. You will use them all in a 4-player game, but not a 2 or 3 player game. This can be problematic if the dice of your personal goal colour do not get drawn. Overall, this is a decent family/gateway game that's made better with some variants that addresses the issue I've mentioned. For me, there are better gateway games out there that do not require variants.

RATING: 5
Sagrada offers a nice puzzle with an aptly selected theme. Prioritizing and selecting dice is fun, especially as your earlier decisions slowly begin to restrict your options, and you curse your past self for your lack of foresight. Despite the apparent variety associated with the various boards, the game boils down to purely to the scoring cards. The few extra points you get from selecting a difficult canvas are not worth the points lost from the objectives. Since the objective scoring is so influential, taking a more difficult board could easily be your downfall, which is a shame. Sagrada is beautiful and quick, but has thoroughly average gameplay.

Sagrada is a nice, lightweight filler game that is easy to teach and pick up. It's a dice drafting where everyone essentially has their own puzzle. As the game progresses, it gets harder to place new dice, making those last couple of rounds even more engaging. The game plays pretty quickly and scoring is fairly simple.

After 5 more plays (2 solo), I am convinced this game is not for me. It's not boring exactly, but it's also not particularly interesting. The solo game was actually more interesting than the 2 player games, but stupidly hard to win. Not that it should be easy, mind you...but not darn near impossible. And despite all the tool cards having the solo configuration, some of their powers are useless in the solo game so you only use them to burn dice. It's pretty, but I have tons of pretty games. That's practically a pre-requisite for joining my collection! :D In any case, this added no value to my collection whatsoever. Sold it.

Sagrada is a gorgeous looking abstract strategy game where each player is building a stained glass window (in reality placing dice in a grid Sudoku style), trying to get different combinations of colours and numbers in their windows with certain restrictions. You may not place the same number or colour orthogonally adjacent to each other, and the window pattern you have chosen must be adhered to with the placement of your dice by either number or colour. You are free to place any colour dice in the white spaces but must still observe the main restrictions. While you are trying to complete your window, you are also trying to qualify for additional points based on the secret colour you have, and three public goals such as 'Colour Diagonals' where you want to have your same colour dice diagonally adjacent as much as possible or 'Light Shades' where you want to have sets of 1 value and 2 value dice. There are also tools available that can help you like the Grozing Pliers that lets you increase or decrease the value of your drafted die by 1,  or the Grinding Stone which lets you flip a die to the opposite side.

Despite me having much anticipation for this game - lots of hype, not available in the UK except for the cost of an arm and a leg, waiting for it for quite a long time etc. - the gameplay left me cold and I never pick it off the shelf. It works fine mechanically as a game, and the drafting works well in the 2 player game (snake draft as in Grand Austria Hotel), but I just didn't feel engaged throughout the games I've played and overall I thought it was rather pedestrian. I find it quite forgettable. My gaming partner likes the puzzle element, but we have more engaging puzzle games so I could take it or leave it. I definitely want to play a few sessions of the solo game before totally making up my mind, but there are SO many games I'd rather play... Also, while it has not been an issue in our games, it strikes me as quite unfair to have the secret goals score the number of pips on the dice. What if somebody's dice all come up high and the other person's all 1s? That doesn't reward skill, tactics or strategy...just luck. Again with the luck, in a 2 player game there are no modifications for the number of dice used so it's quite possible that the dice you need come out in low numbers. I love dice games, and lucky games, but these aspects just didn't seem to fit here.

Score is bumped up by a point for the gorgeous artwork and the lovely production quality. The score trackers are a wee bit too small and fiddly for me though, so I have replaced them with 2 acrylic gems each per player in their associated colours. One is used to track their score, and if they go over 50 they keep the other one in front of them.

I really enjoyed this one, it's like a soduko with dice.  About 15 minutes per person.

The public goals can really make or break you.  In our first game, all three goals dealt with column/row goals so in order to make the most points, we were really hamstrung in a good way.

I played with, and like, the following variants:
- remove 4 dice of each color when playing with 3 so all the dice in the bag get used and everyones secret color comes up the same number of times.  With 2 players remove 8 dice of each color
- when selecting a die you can choose to discard it to the Round Tracker if you want, helps to add a little bit of strategy if you know which color others are going for.

très bon "time filler" de pige et placement de dès. côté qualité c'est vraiment bien! à la fois résistant et beau. côté rejouabilité c'est vraiment excellent, aucune partie ne sera la même avec tout les designs qu'il est possible de faire avec les cartes en plus du lancer des dès. une partie dure environ 20 minutes et le jeu ne prend pas trop de place sur une table. Il n'a pas été traduit en français pour le moment (janvier 2018) mais il est très facile à apprendre malgré la barrière de la langue. vous pouvez maîtrisé les règles en 30 minutes ce qui est excellent. les des sont beau le thème est original mais pour ne répondra pas à vos attentes si vous attendez des mégas régles et plusieurs options et choix cela dit la mécanique est bien. bon jeu il sera dans mon top 3 des time-fillers assurément.

Sagrada is a light and fairly quick dice drafting and puzzle game. The main focus is on putting dice in the best places on your personal player board. Interaction is low, as is player influence on the dice you get and what you can do with them.
The scoring rules seem somewhat out of whack: The public goals that you mostly have to work hard to achieve score comparatively little while the secret personal goal can easily tilt the game either way depending on whether the dice come out in your favour or not.

Full potential of aesthetic is not realized primarily because of the ugliness and triteness of die pips, which is critically important as the greatest appeal of this game is the aesthetic.

Got at books a million north myrtle mall October 2017.
Have played this (mostly 4 player) about half a dozen times now. I really, really enjoy this game. One of the best "blind" pick ups ever for me. I had never even heard of it when I saw it on the shelf, and it ended up being the hit of vacation. It scratches that pattern building itch of games like patchwork, which my wife loves, but it has more to it to keep me interested, with the 3 random objectives each game and random dice pulls/rolls which give you new decisions each turn. It reminds me slightly of a mix between patchwork and Blueprints,  but for for now this is my favorite game of the 3, easily. My wife and pretty much everyone I've played it with likes it as much as I do.

Interesting, modern classic, with just enough brain-burnery goodness to make it more than a filler but light enough to make it a good mid-course for an evening of games. I enjoyed playing this quite a bit, but I would be lying if I didn't admit that the end-game is quite painful and sort of saps the enjoyment. It's all part of the game, of course, and clever placement will keep your options open... possibly. There is still a good amount of luck here due to the dice, and the special powers might allow you to manipulate your bad fortune. But if it isn't in the stars, prepare to be frazzling your brain as you try to make a die work and realize after sitting there starving for ideas that it ain't ever gonna happen. Still, an enjoyable game that I would play again. It didn't win me over enough to buy it at this point, but I'm still thinking about it.

It's a stunning game that does exactly what it sets out to do: Be a quick and simple dice drafting game. This is my new standard for gateway games, it's simple enough so that anyone can learn the game, it's fast enough to keep players engaged and it's pretty enough to draw people in. The puzzle is interesting, but not AP-prone and if you want  interaction there's plenty of opportunities to hate-draft.

The one weakness it has is that it is pretty much multiplayer solitaire. That's fine for a short gateway game though, I still really like it. I'm worried that it will get stale though, most objective cards are very similar and it's boring that all of the secret objectives are the same.

Fun, little abstract that includes dice drafting, puzzly player boards, public & secret goals, and rule breaking cards. Having the boards front and center so you can see what your opponents are trying to do is a must for more player interaction. This means the game is best at 2 and good at 3.

Both Azul and Blueprints are better versions of this game. 

The problem with Sagrada is that there are always too many moves you can make that are just fine, the good moves are bonus/role/turn order dependent so don't make you feel clever for making them, and even if you do manage to see a move that would marginally mess up your opponent (remember, they'll still probably have at least 2 or 3 other dice they can still draft just fine) it's at the expense of you and your opponent and to the exclusive benefit of whoever is left out. 

The secret color objective was bad (if your color doesn't role out for 3 rounds and your opponent's roles out multiple 5's and 6's, guess what? Even if you hate draft them  you'll still end up losing to the player you're not hate drafting) and if I ever am somehow forced to play this game again I'd probably insist on playing without it. 

Blueprints, while not a perfect game either but still a pretty good one I like playing, has dice that are equally weighted score-wise for everyone and you are drafting less of them. This means it's easier to track what others are doing and actually play against them, even in a multiplayer game where things are hidden behind screens (which also reduces analysis paralysis, something this game could have if people attempted to puzzle it out). The 3d design also makes it just feel cooler to me too. 

I played with the 4 and 5 star difficulty boards and it was easy.

This is a very refreshing, light, interesting dice drafting game. When I first saw this I thought it was an insta-buy given that I don't have any dice drafting games in my collection. But after playing it, I'm glad I didn't buy it. There is nothing wrong with the game. I liked it. It was enjoyable. But I think this one will be forgettable when all is said and done. If I have 30-45 minutes to play something with interesting choices, I'll stick with First Class or even Splendor. And as dice drafting games go, I'm probably more interested in Roll Player and its recent expansion than I am in playing this again.

Sagrada is a drafting dice placement game. The focus here is on building your own boards. Drafting is somewhat secondary and less of a decision, but building your player board is where the game offers several points of interest. There is generally one simple rule--dice of the same color or number cannot be adjacent. Something as simple as this makes for an interesting dilemma. Rules are easy to explain and quick to grasp. Sagrada does what it sets out to do very well. It is much less interactive than its contemporary Azul, but it has a greater focus on player boards. The components are pleasing and the dice are colorful. It gives a satisfying feeling when you complete a stained glass. Sagrada is a good game. It doesn't reach greatness, but I would hardly turn down a game. As for scaling, lower player counts is where this shines.

Fine dice game with a puzzle aspect. You draft dice and place them on your personal matrix, respecting some restrictions and trying to form certain patterns to score. It's light and fairly quick, although it can cause some analysis paralysis in some players.

The biggest problem is the huge randomness in private goals, which score the sum of dice in a given color. They can generate a wildly varying amount of points, depending on how lucky you are to have your color drawn out of the bag in the right number, to have high rolls for those dice, and not to have an opponent take them before you.

The game is obviously overrated because of its excellent production, with fitting translucent dice and beautiful but completely superfluous player boards.

First of all, the game is gorgeous. In addition to being well constructed and sturdy, the artwork is lovely.  The colored dice look great and completing your window is super satisfying.  This all adds up to a game that feels nice to play.
It's a little light-weigh, and I could see play-throughs starting to feel too samey over time.  But I love that I can teach it easily to my friends and family who are used to playing only party games.  My 12 year old niece picked it up quickly, and I loved seeing her start to really strategize in her second and third plays.
It's definitely a recommend from me. The quality of construction and the style impress friends at a game night, the mechanics are versatile enough to lend themselves to both casual play and higher strategy, and it's a nice gateway game.

Clever game, wherein you must draft dice to place on your personal board, following various placement rules. Scoring incentives are different from game to game, so this should remain fresh for a while.

A nice, very attractive, but not inaccessible abstract, Sagrada pits players in a dice drafting duel to complete stained glass windows using the colorful dice.
The catch is that no two orthagonal edges may be of similar colors, and no two orthoganal edges may share a number.
Between this and the limitations of the window template- not mentioning the tough choices when drafting and possibly when placing dice, this is a sharp new game, with broad appeal.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (January 2018)

I wasn’t expecting much from the game due to the hype. Acquiring Sagrada was hard and expensive because it was out of stock everywhere. After playing it, I can say I enjoyed it and I want to play it again :D.

The rules are pretty easy to teach, you can do it under 5 minutes. Playtime is around 1 hour with 4 players, although it probably plays better with 2 players.

The theme is irrelevant to me, but when you finish the game, the windows look gorgeous on the table. Sagrada´s components are good.

Gameplay is engaging and interesting as long as all players play quickly. I think the game can have some downtime and I really hate this part, so, I prefer it with 2 or 3 fast players. I just found out Floodgate Games plans to publish a 5-6 player expansion. I almost always dislike this, but I will buy it anyway for the rest of the components. I don´t see myself playing Sagrada with more than 4 players. In your turn you have to pick a die and use it the best way you can, this is a fun decision, but not really hard. Sagrada has a light-medium weight.

It seems the game has a high replay value because you have lots of objectives, tools and windows to try.

I´m still undecided if the luck factor is high or not, controllable or uncontrollable. You can lose if the color you need doesn’t appear, but my gut feeling tells me this won’t bother me as the game plays rather fast and you have some tools to use to help you when luck doesn’t go your way.

Bottom line, Sagrada was a pleasant surprise for us, it is more deep than I initially thought it would be. My SO liked the game so we are keeping it for now. I need more plays to see whether its rating will improve or fall. For now, I will buy all its promos and expansions and I want to play it again soon. Gorgeous game.

Only played solo so far. It plays quickly and was quick to learn. I found the rules clear and well presented. It is a difficult game to win solo and I like that. I do think it has a lot of luck as in one game the final draw was terrible and I lost the game as a result. Lots of interesting decisions though and after one game I wanted to play it again right away. I think playing with others will bring a different feel to the game and will require different strategys and ways of thinking. This game didn't blow me away but I enjoyed it enough that I would definitely play it again and keep it around for a while. Also I think this is a good gate way game and one I can play with the family :)

RATING: 7
Over ten rounds, players draft up to twenty rolled dice (out of 90) of colors chosen randomly from a bag to place on a grid with defined set of requirements and certain restrictive placement rules. The grid sheets are of varying levels of difficulty, requiring colors on some squares and numbers on others. The harder the sheet, the more action tokens a player receives. Action tokens are used to activate three tool cards that allow you to move dice on your grid, sometimes ignoring placement restrictions. After ten rounds, players are scored based on 3 community goal cards and one private goal card.

I enjoy light abstracts on occasion, but because you are drafting rolled dice, the amount of control you have here can feel very limited, even for a light abstract. The biggest constraint is not the requirements sheets, but the fundamental requirement that you cannot place the same number or color orthagonally adjacent. You always need to keep this in mind when placing next to a grid sheet requirement space and in some cases you need to use tool cards to maneuver dice in order to enable a legal placement. In placing the last few dice, it always seems to come down to drawing the right colors and rolling the right numbers. I suspect I'm bumping my score on this a point because of the production. Pure game play would be a point lower.

Sagrada provides a generous dose of meditative, puzzly fun. Its rules are easily grasped and play flows at an agreeably brisk pace. The decisions are repetitive, but not tedious. If you enjoy drafting, you will likely find Sagrada to be a refreshing addition to the genre.

Highly disappointed with this one, while it is meant to be visually appealing, the game is a mess functionally. Thinking several turns ahead to make sure you can fit all your dice is just not an exciting prospect. Azul is way superior to this one.

RATING: 7
Sagrada is a multiplayer solitaire, dice drafting game, that plays like a Sudoku puzzle. The game has a beautiful table presence, and the dice placement goes well with the theme of creating a stained glass window. 

It is a very thinky game with very little player interaction. The game rewards you 
handsomely for completing your own puzzle, so there is little incentive to "hate draft."  It plays well at  two or three player game. Not recommended as a four player game.

With two or three players, it is possible not to draft the color of die of your secret objective. At the end of the game, all the die of your color could still be in the bag. There is a BGG variant correcting this flaw. When playing with three players, remove one set of four die of each color. With only two players, remove two sets of die of each color. Then you will use all the die in the bag, just like in a four player game. I would never play without this house rule; it should be in the standard rule set.  I have found Sagrada to be a game enjoyed by both gamers and non-gamers.  A welcome addition to my game collection.

Excellent filler type game or good for multiple plays in a row. Simple rules with plenty of (hard) decisions to make. I enjoy the variety of scoring methods and this game seems to have a surprising amount of strategy. My only knock is that no matter how much you plan the dice can ruin your plans, there is some mitigation but, again, you only get a few of those options each game and the ones you get may not be the ones you really need.

RATING: 9
For those of you who enjoy dice-drafting and games that rely heavily on puzzle elements, this is phenomenal.  Your decisions about which dice to choose depend on what placement limitations you may have at that moment, what end-game victory points you're going for, and maybe what you believe will just set you up better for the future.  It plays fast enough and is deeply satisfying for people like me who enjoy puzzling out the most victory points in games like this.  

The components are really quite impressive.  The thickness of the cardboard is among best I've seen anywhere.  You'll want to sleeve the cards because they aren't the best quality, but everything else has the heft of quality to it.  The stained glass art design is of course beautiful, giving the game a great table presence.  It's a relatively small footprint also.  Double-sided windows and several end-game victory condition cards ensure that your replay value will be more than sufficient.  

One of my favorites.

Played it with my 5yrs old daughter. Both on easy windows.
The game is pretty much accessible and has an accessible learning curve.

My only complaint is that the Dice are just to small, for a kid just trying to set them on the window is halfway to lose it. For me, even not having big hands, just trying to put a dice without messing all the others around on later turns is an all new skill game.

A very good filler/light family game with possibility for strategic gaming against experienced gamers, although you would also increase the analysis paralysis risk, but I'd gladly pay extra to have bigger dice.

Dice drafting is awesome, and this does it well. Insane replayability though the tools and objectives. At 2-3, you can get hosed if some colors aren't drawn and you need then, especially your secret goal color. Also, make sure you have both color and number represented in the objectives, or the game is subpar.

Players draft dice from a common pool and try to make the best stained glass window with those dice (based on color and value).

There are public goals as well as hidden goals. This game has lots of variation and is a real brain teaser.

Interesting little abstract puzzle with some complex strategies as you trade off various objectives. The tool cards allow you to break the rules, giving you just enough of a break from the sometimes punishing constraints.  This comes together for some mid-
 or late-game plays — combinations of a great roll, a perfect placement, and a well deployed tool card — for some really satisfying moments. 

The theme doesn't do much for the imagination, but it does add a little bit of beauty and interest to something that could otherwise feel like a competitive Sudoku match.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Tis somewhat an interesting dice puzzle but there is a fair bit of luck of the draw and roll. Not sure quite what to think. Looks nice. However, I found it irritating that my blue dice were largely low numbers and an opponent's red dice were all high numbers meaning she doubled my score and then some with her personal goal. There is little that can be done. I'm thinking I'd prefer the personal goal to just be a point per color die so it isn't a huge deal overall and the public goals remain the focus. Looks pretty!

I've recently started to appreciate dice placement games more if they have fun puzzles to work through, like in FUSE and in Roll Player. (Although I don't like pure luck-based dice games like Dice Town.) I also love stained glass windows, so the theme is a big win. I really enjoyed my visit to Barcelona and seeing the Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família in person. After one play, I decided that although Sagrada is pretty, I'd much rather just play Roll Player.

Wir bauen ein Kirchenfenster mit Würfeln.
Der Startspieler fischt #-Spieler+1 Würfel aus einem Beutel und wirft diese. Reihum nimmt sich nun jeder Spieler einen und danach nochmal einen in umgekehrter Reihenfolge. Es gibt dabei 5 verschiedene Farben mit je 6 Augenzahlen (w6 halt).
Die genommenen Würfel müssen sofort in sein vor sich liegendes Fenster eingebaut werden, dabei ist zu beachten, dass vordefinierte Felder mit der entsprechenden Farbe oder Wert belegt sein müssen und Würfel gleichen Wertes bzw. gleicher farbe dürfen nicht benachbart liegen.
Am Ende des Spiels erhält jeder Punkte anhand der 3 Karten in der Tischmitte, die zeigen, für was es Punkte gibt (verschiedene Würfelfarben je Spalte, # blauer Würfel, etc.).
Das Spiel hat eine hohe Varianz durch die in jedem Spiel neuen Ziele und Sondereigenschaften, sowie dem Zufall der Würfelfarben und Werte.
Es ist ein recht spaßiges Spiel, aber eines das ich nicht jedes mal spielen brauche. Nett und ich spiele es wieder mit, aber kaufen oder selbst vorschlagen würde ich es nicht.

A very beautiful looking game with bright, colourful dice that you use to make stained glass windows through dice drafting. Reminds me a bit of Sudoku, and that's probably why I like it so much.

Sagrada has a very basic element of sudoku attached to it, and while I find sudoku completely maddening, I absolutely love Sagrada.  In short, you draft a die at a time, place it on your window in an appropriate spot (some spots/locations on your window have color or number restrictions).  The game is extremely easy to learn but can challenge you mentally.  Games play quickly and it scales well between amount of players.  The big trick is policing other players' windows who have just played for the first time to make sure they haven't put two of the same color or number next to each other (an illegal move).  Sagrada is HIGHLY recommended!

RATING: 8.5
Sagrada is a beautiful dice-drafting game. The different scoring public and secret cards increases the replayability. The variety of windows difficulty also make the game interesting. The solo variant is very fun but brutal at the same time. The game plays quickly and there's basically no set-up time, which is a great thing when playing with my girlfriend.

Beautiful game that shines at any amount of players that you throw at it.  Can be a very isolationist game, or very take that oriented depending on the play style of the group that you're playing with.  Teachable in 5 minutes or less.  My biggest gripe is the fact that it is not colorblind friendly at all, but I'm not exactly sure how you would fix that.

Sagrada is an abstract game of building stained glass windows.  It is a puzzle game with dice drafting.  Everyone gets a unique window and you can choose from two cards that are double-sided with different difficulty levels.  In the game you get out a number of dice from the bag that is equal to 2n+1 where n is the number of players and you roll them.  The start player selects a dice and there is a snake draft.  The final dice is used as time marker. Dice can only be placed orthogonally adjacent to dice that are not the same color or number.  You have 3 different says to break those rules and can use a crystal currency (don't remember name) for paying for these.  Usually you can do this about 2 to 3 times.  

You score based on the number of pips on your dice of the same color for a special color you work on.  You also have threes special ways to score that are random.  Add up your points at the end of game and the most points wins.  If you tie, most points from your bonus card wins if I remember correctly.  

Its a fun game.  I like it about as well as I like Azul.  If you don't like puzzle games, you will not like this.

Gave it an extra point for the great graphic design. It was one of those games where to be good you have to not only know what to do, but what all the other players need, but it's got so many ways to score points that you can't really keep track of the other players. Ends up being a game where you only look at your own board and then see who wins at the end, because you have no idea. Lots of games do this and are popular, just not my type of game.

Won this in the June 2017 "Games for Geekgold"!!

An attractive game, with quality parts, to be sure.
Gameplay is light but it is easy to make mistakes, and strategy is tough to plan since the dice rolling and drawing is so random.
Still, an interesting, fun, and definitely different game than anything else in the collection. Well worthwhile.

Great game for what it does. Components are of stellar quality and once you play it the first time, games take between 15-25 min. It offers a lot for the little time you get to play. Dice drafting is always fun. In a two player game there could be some slight hate drafting, but it is very minimal as you always will most likely focus on your own window. 
My only complain is that there could have been added a few more tool cards and window patterns. I'm sure that they will be offered in the upcoming expansion, but hate to pay more for it as it adds a 5th player and I don't see the need to play it at that count. Overall amazing filler, and a keeper.

RATING: 7
I'm not usually a fan of puzzle games but this game hits all the right notes.  There isn't much player interaction, if at all, so it's a game about being more efficient than everyone else.

What makes this game, besides the easily understandable restrictions, is the various "public goals" and random powers that are used in each game.  Because of this, it makes a simplistic game have numerous scenarios that players need to engage to win.  I'm very impressed by the rules and the overall design.

I won't add this to my collection though because I'm not too much of a fan of puzzle games, especially ones that are more focused on a solitaire affair.  Plus the game is very expensive due to the numerous (but beautiful) dice.

Really fast, pretty fun.  Like Small City extra-light.  It does always bug me a little when a game relies on public and private objectives for scoring, and this is worse than most with the zero variety in private objectives.  They seem pretty powerful and made the difference in my play.  The puzzle is fun enough for the length of the game, which is good, but the last couple rounds can be frustrating.

This is a really neat game. You are dealt a card at the beginning of the game with a pattern on it. Your goal is to draft dice over the course of ten rounds trying to complete the pattern on the card. It has a similar feel to a watered down sudoku, you are actively avoiding having colors and numbers touch. The game also gives you point scoring objectives, and rule breaking "tool" cards to use.

Kind of like Blueprints, but more involved without any additional payoff.  Production values are nice, especially the way the sheet slides into the window/player mat.

Not bad. This is an interesting quick puzzle game of placing coloured dice and build you beautiful window.

Boy, I wanted to like this game more -- the theme is great and production value is high. But it really is a sullen affair. Other than depriving opponents of dice from the drafting pool, this is a solitary experience. Snooze. But the worst part is the scoring. The secret goals account for an outsize percentage of your total. Why bust your hump over several turns vying for a 4-point public goal when you can score 4, 5 or 6 by drafting a single die of your secret color? And the end-game deduction for an empty space on your board is only one point? It feels like the designer didn't think the scoring through enough. Unsurprisingly, Sagrada was kickstarted.

This is a really gorgeous dice drafting game about crafting stained glass windows using translucent dice. Each round players will draft up to two dice trying to fill in their window to score the most amount of points possible. Each player has their own hidden objective that tells them which colour dice that scores them bonus points. In addition there are three public objectives that require some kind of combination of either colour or shades (pip value) on the dice, and there are also three tool cards that players can spend favour tokens on in order to manipulate the dice.

This is a great game for people who enjoy puzzles, who appreciates beautiful games, or who simply enjoys the dice drafting mechanism. I'm all three and have highly enjoyed this game

It is a quick to learn and play type of game but one that feels like it is a competitive solo game, rather than a multiplayer game (if that makes sense) - but this is not a bad thing

It is a drafting puzzle, but very easy to learn and get into with a depth and strategy that is enjoyably unexpected

Because it's pretty, easy to teach, and allows me to chuck dice in my DIY-ed dice tray (that still makes me feel so accomplished!).

I wonder if I should house rules this when I play solo and only use one die on the round track? And always choose the highest die to place on the track?

Only thing that could be improved is the variety of windows, tools and objectives, could have a little more of each.

Excellent dice drafting game where players build a "window" using the dice. Picking from a variety of window plans (offered at varying difficulty levels), having three varying public goals, one varying private goal, and three varying "tools" (special public powers which can be rented for use) make each game feel like a radically different challenge. Components are top notch. Rulebook is solid.

Played at Pax South

This game is everything I look for in a game.  The game is wonderful to look at as the artwork on the boards is beautiful and the way the board looks when the dice are being added really seems to sparkle like a stained glass window.  And seeing the patterns emerge in my and other people's boards is worth playing alone for me.

As for the gameplay, this is a basic drafting game, but the way the boards are set up, it seems to limit the amount we were able to antagonistic towards one another.  There are so many options for the first 6-7 rounds of the game that you're mainly trying to set up your board to have the most options when you can really start to block your opponents.  It was difficult to try to keep up with my opponent's point total you only calculate points at the very end of the game and everyone has a secret objective in addition to the shared objectives.

I honestly enjoyed this game a lot, and would easily suggest it to my friends as a game they should both purchase and play together.

RATING: 6.5
Players are drafting  one colored dice at a time to fit to put into their display with two rules: Same colored dice cannot be orthogonally adjacent, and dice with the same numbers cannot be adjacent.  The theme is building a church window, and before the game, you select a mat with a difficulty level. This determines how many tokens you can use for tools. The mat is also seeded with certain requirements on where some specific dice must be placed. Each game, three cards display how many points you score for certain combinations of dice (e.g, all different colored dice in a row score 5 pts, or all diagonals of the same color score that number of points, etc). During your turn, you can use a tool to break some of the rules of the placement by spending your token; the next player that wants to use that tool has to spend one more token on that tool. 

It's an okay game. It fits in somehwere between a filler and party game. It could bog down if you try to pay attention to what your opponents are trying to accomplish with their dice. It's an interesting diversion.

this is a simple game, with minimal confusing in the rules.  But there is lots of going on. The theme is abstract with drafting of dice to complete your stain glass window.  I had problem with the theme  and it just did not grab me.  This is a good gateway game for family games with simplicity  in play and generic enough to be attractive for many non gamers.

A rather fresh dice selection & placement puzzle but could have used a bit more fine tuning to clear out the rough edges (in both production and gameplay) and balance issues. Especially the secret player colors are a massive luckfest. It is also very easy to accidentally knock over the dice in your own grid.

Interesting game with great components. A multi-player dice-drafting puzzle that seems to be a bit of a brain-burner at first, until you see how early choices can greatly affect your endgame.  I see this improving with more plays as I learn to see the effects of my choices and become more aware of what dice other players are looking for to complete their own boards.  The randomly determined goals, secret goals, tools, and play boards make me think that this game has a lot of replay value.

[b]Sagrada[/b] was Kickstarter purchase.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Sagrada is a light, dice drafting game that has top notch production values. The player boards are unbelievable, they each include a slot to slide in your stained glass window card and have a very nice glossy finish. This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing games I own and is absolutely a show piece when it is on the table. 

If you've played a dice game like Cubist or Blueprints you'll be able to jump into Sagrada, which is basically a 2D version of those games. Even if you are not familiar those games the rule book is only a couple of pages with clear examples which makes learning Sagrada a breeze. While playing Sagrada you will draft dice and then have to place them on your window following simple yet increasingly difficult placement rules [i](you can not place a die that has the same color or number as a die it is orthogonally adjacent to)[/i]. There are tools which allow you to break certain rules of the game, but you will only be able to use them a few times during the game. There are a lot of different stained glass window cards, game end scoring cards and tools which add a lot of variety from game to game. Game play is quick, ranging from 20 to 45 minutes depending on player count. 

Sagrada is a spacial puzzle game with very little player interaction; you may draft a die someone else wants and that's about it. Personally I enjoy these types of games, but if you are looking for more player interaction I'd recommend Cubist. Sagrada is a beautifully produced gateway game that is also a great opener/closer on a game night. This is one Kickstarter game that I am glad to have backed.[/i]

A beautiful looking game, and after our first play everyone was wondering how we could get hold of a copy. Everyone has a unique 5x4 grid with varied dice requirements on it - this spot can only be yellow, this spot a 2, etc - but no die can be orthogonally adjacent to a die of the same colour or number. The aim is to get as many dice out as possible, and over the 10 rounds you claim 2 dice each turn from a draft, settlers-style. Each round your options diminish as to what dice can validly be placed on your board, and the game feels more and more like Take It Easy - how long can you keep your perfect board going. It's got variable Kingdom Builder type scoring options for inter-game variety, a big plus. The only reason for not rating it higher as that I suspect your score can bust pretty easily on the final rounds, out of your control (again, much like Take It Easy). But it's certainly enjoyable in the playing.

Based on one play: A set of dice are rolled and you must place them into your stained glass window in order to create the window you have been hired to create. The window has requirements of color and number as well as restrictions so you have to plan and also sometimes get lucky. A nice cute game, however at five the game is missing dice (the fifth board was a Kickstarter bonus but they did not add the needed dice) and you can chose more difficult windows to make but there is no compensation, so to make it easier just chose a simple one.

Sagrada is a filler-weight dice drafting game where each player is trying to fill in a 5x4 "stained glass window" grid with dice. Each player has a unique board telling them that certain spaces have to be filled with dice of certain colors or values. Additionally, there are public goals that give players points for having various sets of dice, and there are rule-breaker cards that players can use a limited number of times. Dice are taken in a snake draft fashion, and those dice can be placed upon a player's board adjacent (orthagonally or diagonally) to another die. However, orthagonally adjacent dice cannot share a color or value. This is an interesting puzzle, as you try to place your dice both to maximize your score as well as leave your options open in the future. As the game comes to an end, it often gets pretty tense as players are looking for more and more specific dice. I thought this game was good fun.

Because of problems/wrong production decisions this his sort of become a grail game.
This is in fact a very streamlined, fast game, so short it's almost in the filler category. But is does a very good job as turns are usually quite fast (only near the end people will suffer from some AP) and it's quite tense as you're wondering if the die you want will still be available when it's your turn to take one.

This is a fun little dice drafting game that emulates a medieval stained glass workshop. Players roll dice of different colors with the rolled value corresponding to the shade of the glass the die represents. Each player has a template that they are trying to fill in, while trying to get bonus points from their own personal goals and the shared goals available to everyone. Each game, there are a handful of tools that are also available that allow limited manipulation of the drafted dice. The game is beautiful, light and fun. However, if one wants something a little meatier with more agency, then I would recommend Roll Player instead, since it has much more opportunity for manipulation of the dice and makes for a more interesting and engaging experience.

One of my absolute favorites from GenCon. I can not wait to own this game. Dice drafting and abstract placement to try and get the most points possible. Different difficulties to use and different actions to possible take each game. The combination of scoring is also changed each game so it will be totally different each time. I LOVE that and I am SO excited to play this one again. I had a great time learning and playing with 4 players.

Sagrada is a very pretty game. However, the depth is not super great. There are 10 drafts, and at 4 players, the game is every bit of 40 minutes to play. The biggest annoyance comes from how easy it is to play incorrectly w/ an errant die placement. An illegal placement caught late really messes up the very long game and there's no great way to resolve it. The penalty of removing the die is huge, the action was unintentional, and it happens all the time. The scoring objectives and bonus scoring are  just ok, as are the tool cards. All in all the game looks pretty on the table, but after 4 plays is unlikely to come off the shelf very often, if at all -- there's just no tension.

Hello, obviously SO-friendly game, nice to meet you! Interesting theme of stained-glass window making, too. Yeah, this one might have to be acquired to fill my wife's occasional desire for light, not-complex and quick games. A dice placement game with restrictions on those placements and a Sanssouci-esque drafting stage which is really painful when the ONE PERFECT DIE you want gets taken right before your turn. Of course, that could have been deliberate, but I found looking at others' boards a step too far for this light game. The changeable powers and scoring both seem like good ways to keep things fresh. No penalty for not filling in a space, seemed odd, was the only thing). This might just light up my collection some day.

This is a perfectly fine but fairly uninspired dice drafting game. You get a little player board that asks for certain dice in certain spots as dictated by color or number, then a few placement rules about what can't go next to what. Then there are a few bonus cards that give extra points to players who managed to build their boards in certain ways. In terms of feel it's sort of like, if you replaced the tile stacks in Barenpark with the randomness of dice. There's a little luck mitigation, but it's mostly about making robotic choices aiming to limit your exposure to the randomness as much as possible. I'd be willing to play it again, but I don't think i'd seek it out.

I need to write a blogpost comparing and contrasting this with Azul, as it crystallises what I've been thinking for a while about these 'get stuff from the middle to play on your own board' games. 

In Azul, the acquisition mechanism is interactive enough and the other players' boards readable enough to make negative moves not just possible but potentially devastating. In Sagrada, you can 'hate draft' to some extent (and more with fewer players) but it still feels as though you'll get a decent score by taking what's best for you and working the individual puzzle well. Secret goals enhance that effect - I just took a bunch of high reds and crushed everyone.

If the puzzle's my main focus, I'd rather just go down the true multiplayer solitaire route (a la Take It Easy or Rolling America) and not bother with the pretence of interaction. This has the advantage of speeding the game up with simultaneous play. I felt that Sagrada's variable goals/tools/boards were a compensation for the lack of variability through interaction.

Simple dice drafting game with various difficulty.  It didn’t seem like the puzzle was too hard to solve (we played 5-6 stars difficulty), it sort of took the fun out of the game as almost everyone could finish theirs, and there were not too much blocking you could do(except maybe the last round)  special powers help mediate the rolls (using favours).  Everyone finished all public goals with exactly same number of sets for all 3 goals, so our personal goals became the only vp difference. Winner won by completed his personal goal with more peeps than 3 others. Feels like BLUE PRINT is a better dice drafting game with more interesting decisions.  Will play more to confirm.

A filler weight game that has several nice elements. 10 rounds of drafting dice to fill in a grid to represent a stained glass window. Dice have restrictions of where they can be placed to score points and to keep options open for future dice. Different grid cards with varying levels of complexity provide a nice puzzle element to make good use of the draft. Scoring is a mix of private/public cards, Tool cards allow you to break some of the placement rules at a cost of VPs. All in all there is a good amount of variety to keep the game interesting through several plays.

This one is a real brain burner.  Kind of Sudoku on steroids.  I liked the way it plays.,  If the dice colors you need do not get pulled from the bag at the right time and if the numbers you need do not get rolled, and if your opponents take the dice you need you will have a tough go of it even if you plan the right strategy.  Still a better player will have the advantage in this one.  There is a lot to think about.

Sagrada is a quite beautiful game. Unfortunately I don't find it to be a good game beyond that. 

Most of the decisions in Sagrada are simply trying to draft or find a die that will fit into your window following the rules. These rules are such that generally only very specific dice will be allowed to be placed. Trying to find ways to focus on how to score points within this framework is even harder but can be done. 

But where Sagrada really fails to me is that I felt like I was playing a game by myself--this game is my new poster child for multiplayer solitaire. Sure there is interaction during the dice draft, but in reality each player can generally only use a few of the dice anyhow and can't take something just to block an opponent from getting it. Even if they could block an opponent, it is likely the other players would benefit far more and as such the best move is to take whatever die will actually fit the best in your window. So I may as well just be playing by myself. 

And I do suspect that Sagrada actually makes for an interesting solo puzzle for this reason--but it really does seem very puzzley. Which is fine if you enjoy that type of thing. I sometimes do, but Sagrada's restrictions on where to place dice just cause me unwanted tension that I don't find much fun with. So overall I have no desire to play this pretty game again.

I thought I would like this game, but I never suspected that it would effortlessly vault into my Top 5. Production is gorgeous, the game is crazy colorful, and finishing your window is so satisfying. Effortless to set up and a breeze to play. This is a game we can break out on any weeknight, which cements its status as a winner. I do wish it came with more window patterns (since we don’t play with the level 3s or 4s anymore), or that I could buy some kind of expansion. It’s not like there’s a lack of variety, I’m just planning to play this game a ridiculous number of times.

One game, five players.

OMFG perfect game for pot smokers!

* No new rules introduced during the game
* Scoring happens only at the end (reduces fiddliness)
* Simple game play and limited player interaction (almost non-existent at 5 players

It's a game that shouldn't really appeal to me. However, because it's a game where you really can't do much when it's not your turn, and when it is your turn, it's relatively easy to figure out what to do when it is your turn (I think I overthought during the game!)

I do not understand the hype on this one. The public objectives are always either slight variations or at total odds with each other. Playing on the "expert" windows usually just means one unlucky roll can set off a chain of terrible turns. The tool cards/beads are a clunky way to try to fix this issue since they seem to only award the player who screws up earliest in the game. Everyone else has to pay extra points. Personally, I would MUCH rather play Cubist or Blueprints.

RATING: 8.8
This came back in stock at Miniature Market after being sold out just about everywhere. I jumped on it and believe I'll be super happy with this game. It feels enough like the recent hit with my family and gaming group, Azul, that I am sure it will go over well. However, it is different enough to justify having both! I have gotten to play it and it is a solid game. It didn't knock my socks off, but I had a lot of fun with it. I love drafting in games, so selecting dice in that way was a hit with me. The puzzle of dice placement in your window is also right in my wheelhouse. I tried to be careful, but still accidentally placed one that made an adjacent location impossible (I used a tool to move it though). There really aren't a ton of ways to get points in this game and it's all done at the end, so no one should feel completely out of it. I must say that the dice are a little smaller than I'd like and can make it hard to place in your window at times without bumping the dice near it. Since the pips matter, you really have to be careful or remember what the number was. It plays fast as well with just 10 rounds. The artwork and colorful nature of this game is amazing! What I really like the most is how it uses the difficulty level of the board you use to assign you more/less tokens. Those tokens are how you are able to use the tools in the game to assist with dice placement (break placement rules, move dice, draw a different dice from the bag, and all sorts of stuff). That helps with the harder boards or just give you points at the end for each one you don't end up using. This would be a nice relaxing filler game for me and for gaming with my family.

Sagrada is a strong filler titlte that is not particularly exciting. It's use of dice placement as the driving mechanism is so simple, and so sterile. There are a few curveballs with the tools, and of course the production is top notch, but really, this was too peaceful to be memorable. It's not horrible, per se, and I suppose sometimes you must just be in the mood for such a game as this.

I like the dice drafting and the puzzly aspect of the game, also how pretty it is and how easy it should be to get to the table because of that.

That being said, the 'no two orthogonally adjacent dice can have the same color or number' can be difficult to keep track of sometimes. I'm usually pretty careful about these things, and I still managed to screw up placement on two separate occasions without noticing it for a few turns later. We'll see in later plays if it gets any easier. If I'm still screwing that up several games in, then it's not quite as gateway as I expected.

I had pretty high expectation to this game since people comparing this to Roll Player and think Sagrada is better. I quite enjoy Roll Player so I was hoping this is better. The game play is very simple, easy to teach. Not a lot of depth other than the puzzle. However, the puzzle heavily depends on the dice roll, which is unpredictable. The early planning is important, but it may be out of your control closer to the end of the game. At this point, I think the game is very random, not enough way to manipulate the dice roll (flavor tokens are limited). I would like to try it couple more times with different objectives and tools cards and see if it changes the feel of the game. At this point, I think Roll Player is better.

Excellent family game. Nice puzzle, nice gameplay and gorgeous production. For tighter experience,  Add variant of removing 7 dice of each color for 2 player game, private objectives divided by 2 rounded up and -2 penalty for each unfinished window.

Enjoyable. Probably the most randomness a game can have & still allow it to be enjoyable, so don't fear the dice element.  There is strategy and chance.

This is a really great game. I've played it with both serious and casual gamers, and both groups have really enjoyed it. It has beautiful components and the table just generally looks lovely while you're playing. The basic gameplay is pretty enjoyable, as you're rolling handfuls (big handfuls, in a 4-player game) of dice and making choices, and at the end of it all, you have a pretty little window full of dice to compare around the table.

For the more serious gamers, there's plenty of satisfying mechanical crunch there to keep you interested; the different objectives give you plenty of variety and replayability, there's a tiny bit of player interaction here and there (because you all share a common draft pool) to keep it from being a completely isolated experience, and the randomized tools give you chances to be particularly clever. I also enjoy how several of the tools become much-more (or much-less) useful as the game proceeds, so there's a lot of strategy involved in when to use them.

The only thing that strikes me as a possible concern is that there's a part at the end where you go around totalling up the scores. Usually I find adding up scores tedious and unpleasant. But in this game, I don't mind the score-totalling process at all for some reason-- I can't say exactly why. It might just be because the things you're looking at to total everything up are so pretty? Either way, it's just not really a problem for me, but if you really hate adding up scores, you might not agree.

[Full disclosure: I backed this on kickstarter.]

It is another super simple puzzle/drafting game that we love to pieces. It sometimes feels like a dice driven Sudoku in all of the best ways possible. The multitude of different tool and objective cards, and window patterns, keep each game feeling different from the last. The game is quick, and easy to set up and play, which makes it a perfect game to play in the evening before bed. It also has gorgeous boards and dice, which make it look great on the table.

Has the feel of a Yahtzee style roll-and-write, in that you have to keep in mind the points you'll get for certain long term objectives, but also the odds of getting the values/colours you'll need to achieve them. Adds drafting to incorporate a low key interaction element.

I really like Sagrada for a lot of reasons. The game can be taught quickly and play progresses at a good pace. The variable setup provides a fresh game play experience each time. The mechanisms work really well together and provide a balanced blend of strategy and luck. The puzzle aspect is engaging and enjoyable. The production quality is really good and the game is quite attractive overall. However, the player boards are almost too colorful since everything starts to blur together after looking at it too long. I really like to use Blueprints (another dice drafting and placement game) as a introductory hobby game for new or casual gamers and would now recommend Sagrada as a next step game since it has similar concepts with some additional complexity and depth. Overall, I definitely enjoyed Sagrada and would happily play it any time.

Very easy to learn - very easy to teach, but can be a little brain burner. I really enjoy this game, but my wife is on the fence, as she is not as fond of figuring out the appropriate combinations. Sometimes you think, great I need a 3 in a particular spot, but you might really need a red 3 in that spot to make the rest of the point configurations and placement work. I really enjoy the puzzle aspect of the game, and having to adapt to the drafting by using tools appropriately. I would be happy to play this with anyone, but we will see how often I can get it to the table.

A nice puzzle game that is easy to teach. It can be a bit thinky, but I think it is still a good choice for a gateway game since the rules are light and the game takes only a few minutes to explain.

The game is pretty and I love the player boards, but the cards are awfully thin. I recommend sleeving them to make them a bit more solid and less prone to damage/warping.

Addictive and pretty, a fun puzzle in trying to place dice to craft stained glass windows for victory points. While it really is just an abstract, the translucent dice and slotted windows give some thematic feel to making stain glass windows. I like how the drafting of dice works from round-to-round, how you can be challenged by the constraints of your card, that each player has their own victory conditions in addition to common objectives, and that the usage of tools can help you to mitigate the luck of the dice.

This is a light dice rolling game that plays really quickly and uniquely themed with constructing stained glass windows.  The basic gameplay reminds me a lot of Blueprints, another light dice rolling game I quite like.  Each round a player will draft available dice and place them in their stained glass window.  There are rules where you can and can't place dice.  Each player has a private goal based on a die color.  There are also public goals and powers that can be used but the powers cost a finite resource to use.

There are a lot of decisions to make here and the powers make the game just deep enough.  Not to mention it is a very pretty game with all the colors.  For an inexpensive, short, and light game there isn't much more you can ask for.

RATING: 7.8
Great dice drafting game! With the dice that are drafted, you are placing them on the player mat (window) with the dice acting like "stain glass". The dice are beautifully colored. The placements rules are the number on the dice cannot be orthogonally next to the same number and similarly for color.  On each player's window there is a grid that also provides individual restrictions. Each game you select 3 scoring cards to determine how the game will be scored (ex: 3 pts for every pair of 5 and 6). 

It is a great puzzley game, with quite a bit of variability from game to game. I wish it lasted a bit longer though.

Oh! Excited about this. Out of the games I'm waiting to receive from Kickstarter at the time of writing, I think this is the one that's the most different to anything else I have in my collection. I don't own a lot of games with dice, and definitely none that can be called dice-heavy. This has dice as the main component, but still uses them in a pretty new and innovative way. And it looks great!

EDIT: After playing a few times solo and a few times with my wife, I can already say this is exactly what I hoped for. It's light but still thinky. It requires both strategy and luck. Players of different skill can fairly play against each other by choosing appropriately difficult window cards.

I'm looking forward to playing with 3 and 4!

EDIT 2: Since my last update, this has rocketed up my most played games :)
My wife absolutely loves it, so I get to play games with her a lot more often since getting this game! The game is beautiful, very simple to learn, but with enough depth to stay interesting. It works very well at all player counts from two to four. I did like the solo variant, even though I found it very hard. I don't play solo very much though, so I haven't tried it any more since my last update.

Even after a couple games, my son could not stop playing with the dice and boards, filling in patterns, sorting dice, and playing with the favor markers.  Such a clever, little game, and each time played, it's trying to put together a puzzle, in order to optimize the community and personal scoring, while not breaking any of the placement rules (or using the tools at the right time to do so).

I really enjoyed the dice drafting and placement aspects of the game. The global objective cards were fun and I liked how they are different every time you played. 

The only thing that I didn't care for was the private objectives. They were just too random and makes all of the other ways to score points seem pointless. (ha). One player at the table more than doubled his score with his secret objective alone. 

I will definitely play again however we will house rule the secret objectives going to forward.

[Floodgate Games 2017 edition] {Church; dice-rolling, set-collection, solo; scalable} Sagrada is a very nice looking game.  It is essentially an abstract puzzle solving game.  Player interaction is quite nice.  It's fun to play.

This game looks easy with 4 players.  Most of the players can complete a window.  Maybe, there are just too many dice to be drafted.  The game becomes less challenging.  Nevertheless, all dices are used, the game is less luck driven.

The game is also a challenging solo game.  I can barely win.

I don’t think this will be a keeper.  I will trade it later.

This is one of my favourite kickstarter games, it's seeing almost weekly play. I admit to bias in this however, as this is one of the few games my partner (who is not into boardgames at all) really enjoys, and indeed actively asks to play.

The premise is simple - make a stained glass window. You can select various boards of various difficulty that add additional colour amped shade restrictions over and above the basic rules. Then you roll dice and try to fill your window.

My partner really enjoys this because of its simple rules, but actually succeeding in completing the window requires a lot of forward thinking on placement of the dice, which again as a methodical person, he enjoys.

The only real criticism I have is that it seems unbalanced if you play differing difficulties of window. We found the additional faith tokens didn't help much, as you lost out in the additional scoring methods due to greater restricted placements. We found it was much harder on the higher difficulties to compete, so we tend to play on the same difficulties, or we have added score multipliers for the harder difficulties to balance out not being able to fulfill these additional objectives as often.

Overall however, I'm really happy to have a game I can enjoy with my partner. I imagine this will also be a great game to play with older children due to its simple rules.

A deceptively simple dice drafting game.   It plays quickly, but there is plenty of strategy to be found between the public and private goals.  The components are great, doing justice to the name.

Time will tell, but the game appears to have enough diversity between the 10 public goals and 12 tool cards to have a pretty good shelf life.

Roll Player has similar dice drafting mechanics with a bit more of an engaging theme.

RATING: 5
Nice concept, but very restrictive placement of the dice. Also it is very easy for a player to make a mistake and go unnoticed due to the rather solitaire element that this game has.

Sagrada is a dice drafting game. Thematically the dice are panes in a stained glass window that you're building.

You start the game with a choice of patterns for your window. These patterns require you to place certain dice in particular spots, placing particular colors in some spots and particular number of pips in other spots (the number of pips is called its "shade", which confusingly has nothing to do with color.) Why you're required to build a window with purple in certain spots and darker shades (higher pips... but in any color) in other spots is never quite clear.

Additionally, you can never place two colors or two shades (pip values) orthogonally adjacent to each other. And every die placement must be adjacent to a previous placement (although diagonally is allowed in this case).

Each round you randomly draw and roll dice. There will be ((2 x number of players) + 1) dice in the round, so that everyone will (potentially) draft two dice, with one left over fill the round marker. Each round the start player rotates clockwise.

In turn order each player drafts first one die, then another. At the beginning of the game placing dice is fairly easy but as the game nears the end, you can become quite constrained, especially if you haven't planned ahead well. And of course, the random draw and rolling of dice might screw you for the color or number of pips you need.

There are three special power cards you can invoke by spending glass beads. You get however many glass beads were on the window design you chose. More difficult patterns give you more beads. The first person to use a power pays one glass bead, from then on they cost two. These let you do rulebreaking things like move dice (possibly ignoring the color or pip requirements), change dice values, take both drafting choices at the same time, etc.

There are also three public scoring goals. These give you points for various things, like having pairs of 5's & 6's or complete sets of 1-5 pips, or having no duplicate colors in a row, etc. The mroe difficult options give more points.

Finally, you have a secret color preference, and you get points equal to the sum of the pips on your dice of that color.

The game is generally fairly quick, although there were moments where it did get a bit bogged down in AP. As the game progresses you become more and more constrained in your dice placement possibilities. And there's a luck element in which colors and pip values come out. But given the speed of the game, that's fine. It wasn't the deepest game, but it was a lot of fun.

[thing=199561][/thing] is a pretty simple game: each player has a board, with 20 spaces. During play, dice are rolled and used to fill these spaces - some of them required specific numbers or colors, others accept any die - at first, at least, since the rules don't allow two numbers nor two dice of the same color to be place orthogonally from one to another.

Thus, as the game passes, it gets trickier to place the dice. Then comes the tools - these are special cards that any player can use, by paying skill tokens - the first use costs 1 token, from the second use on (no matter the player), it will cost 2 tokens. These tools allow breaking the rules to some extent - usually giving breathing room to allocate the dice.

All of this is done for points - each person starts with a secret objective, always of a color of dice - the dice of the show color will count points equal to the pips on them. Also, three open objectives will be there, and will give points to any player that fulfills their conditions. Open spots on the player board will give 1 negative point. At the end of 10 rounds (players take 2 dice per round), the person with the most points will be the winner!

Simple, elegant, with a good amount of luck but also decisions thrown in. This is basically [thing=199561][/thing] in a nutshell. It is also very pretty - with its translucent dice, and there are plenty of pictures showing its beauty.

The mechanics are sound and reminded me as a better version of [thing=140933][/thing], as it has more replay value, more options and meat in the bones, while taking basically the same amount of time to finish.

Overall, I was quite pleased with [thing=199561][/thing] - it is a super filler, and it works nicely for 2 and 3 players (with 4 the downtime, while not a major issue, can bother a little, since there is nothing to do on other players turn, not even plan, as is hard to predict what to do when the other persons are still picking dice). [thing=199561][/thing] is pretty, easy and smart - my kind of [-]gir[/-]-game.

A quick, less-thinky game for me and my wife to play when we're craving a game, but are short on time and energy. Not a lot of tough decisions, but it's fun, engaging, and beautiful to look at.

Really enjoyed Sagrada. Yes, this is a personal tableau kinda game with low player-player interaction. But if you like these types of games, then Sagrada is actually quite fun. There is enough complexity for repeated plays and also enough decisions to make it interesting. The addition of tools certainly makes game play even more challenging. I find Sagrada a bit more superior to NMBR. For some reason, I can see how a repetitive pattern for NMRB might make it state. Yet, there is enough variety in the public/personal objectives to make the game interesting. Curious to see how this compares to Azul.

One of my favorite games of 2017. As in any dice game, someones what's drawn or rolled doesn't work for you, but that's life. I find this to be a very quick, fun puzzle. It scales extremely well, though I always play with the variant of ensuring an even distribution of dice based on player count.

I was skeptical about this but purchased it after seeing many, many good reviews.  The game far exceeds my original expectations.  It's gorgeous and fun.  I like the use of dice in a game, but love how it involves as much strategy as luck.  We forgot the rule that dice could only be placed next to already placed dice on our first couple of plays, and imagine that will make it much more challenging in the future.  (It's lighter but still quite fun and competitive without that rule.)

4/16/2017 - This is one of my better Kickstarter purchases. I really enjoy this game. It's quick to teach and pretty quick to play, but has a nice puzzle strategy to it. There is also definitely some player interaction, as with the dice drafting sometimes it pays to look at the other player's windows before picking which die you'll take. Really like a lot!

Solid, light and fast game. A bit solitaire-ish, but it's a nice and soothing experience working on your window. It does allow for some interaction, so I suspect we'll start seeing that more as we get it to the table in the future.

Gorgeous, thematic, and simple. Hits all the right filler game buttons. It would hit the table more if it were better balanced though; there's no reason not to grab the level 3 windows if you get them, so good luck to the poor sap who stuck with the level 6 one! Sure, you could house rule that everyone has to use them same level windows but I'd rather not have to balance the designer's game for them.

Not too long - 50-60 minutes for a 4 player.
Loved it.

It will be interesting to play a few more times to see how luck based the game ending is or how much this can be mitigated by keeping you tool credits to mitigate this during the last turn.

Best game of 2017 for me. An excellent blend of all the elements that make a game great: breathtaking, colorful artwork on the box and the dice, an easy to understand but deep puzzling mechanic, and plenty of replayability. Thanks to the numerous pattern, objective and tool cards, every game will feel completely different and that will reflect in the scores. Last but not least, Sagrada only takes about 30 minutes to play, so it's easy to string several sessions together or to use the game as a filler. A home run on all accounts.

RATING: 7.7
Theme is completely arbitrary.

But the mechanics are fun. Roll dice equal to 2xPlayers +1, then take turns drafting dice into your window.  Like colors and numbers cannot be adjacent to each other.  Some spots need a specific color or number. Each player earns bonus points for sum value of one specific color.  There are common goals that all players can earn points towards.

The dice-rolling randomness doesn't really affect strategy too much.  There is the right amount of player interaction to force you to plan ahead, but you should be able to do something beneficial for you on every one of your turns, except for maybe the last turn when you need a very specific die or two to finish your window.

Major flaw!  With 10 rounds the game plays best with 5 players so each player goes first an equal number of times.  It's stupid the game wasn't published for 5 and forces you to buy an expansion to get 5 players.

Sagrada is a puzzle game, like sudoku, where players draft dice to set on their window grid following some simple placement rules.

2017-05-16 Insidious and fun "glass"-drafting game, in which the glass is lovely translucent dice. The rules are quite simple, but the choices (and gambling associated therewith) can be delightfully agonizing. I wish the dice were not so very rounded: It's too easy to knock them to the wrong face, even once they're in your frame, and it [b]always[/b] matters how many pips are showing. It's good enough that this certainly won't deter you from playing, unless you are sufficient shaky that you will always knock the dice about. If that's the case, you will need an assistant to place your dice for you.

Backed on Kickstarter. This is a great unique filler. It is multiplayer solitaire, but a game doesn't last for more than a half hour even with four players. I wish the private objectives were more variable, but there are several public objectives to keep replays interesting. I'm willing to play this anytime to pass time, take a break between heavier games or as a nightcap game.

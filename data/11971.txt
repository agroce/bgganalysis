Always a great filler.  This game is not about winning.  It's about not losing.  When the table "smells" someone close to going down, that player is bombarded with cards.  Must have a fun group to play.

Custom made version, featuring insufferable characters such as Jar Jar Binks, Bella Swan, and Wesley Crusher. This has quickly become a favorite of the bluffing games with our game group. This game gives a group of players incredible opportunities to bluff together as a team on the fly.

A unique bluffing game where there is no winner, only a loser.  Improves upon Liar's Dice by allowing for punishment of players who play it too safe/don't bluff.  It's fun to make the loser take a drink before the next game.  Simple to teach and play. Works in groups as small as 3 and as large as 10, although there's some downtime as the group size increases.  The sweet spot is about 6-8.

yessir - as easy as ... ( fill in what u like) and a perfect starter for the night or just fun with the kids as well as with grandma or the wife. We used to play "mäxle" before (dunno what it is called outside germany, but there must be equivalents: two dices passed clockwise hidden under a cup, while each draw has to top the one before??? anyway) but since this one makes the cards goes to and fro and wherever you decide, there is something like strategy with it - depending on your opponents of course! Very communicative with easy rules - the right combination to get the evening going! Oops i forgot to mention the design which i personally like very much!

describing something as a pure bluff game is actually appealing to me, so i hoped for more here.  great art, simple rules, but not much gameplay.  more discussion was spent on how to game the system than playing the game itself.  just issues like whether or not it's wise to pass every time, etc.  still worth another go for me.

RATING: 7.8
For such a simple game of passing and bluffing off cards, this one does have a subtle layer of depth there since you're trying to force other players into a 'losing' situation with a row of similar pest cards. I also like that only one player 'loses' and the rest win, always a nice twist. The art is great, though I think I overall prefer the similar Cheating Moth (Mogel Motte) in terms of gameplay (they are both in the same line).

Not going to be good for people that can't lie well, or tell when others are. But the five of us that played the games I have recorded here all had a lot of fun, even with four of us learning.
It seemed to take longer than it should have, come the end I was tiring of it. But I did play two in a row so it was obviously okay at the time.

This is a very basic/light bluffing game that requires the right group. For those looking for something meaty, they likely will be annoyed as the game provides little meaningful information. But for those that enjoy player dynamics and looking for a beer and pretzel filler game, this may provide to be an enjoyable distraction.

Pretty much a 50/50 guess each time you get passed a card. Yes you can try and read the previous player(s) and could also pass the card, however it mostly comes down to a coin-flip. A little more fun when there is one person to target in order for them to lose, but then there isn't much fun in declaring one loser amongst all the players.

What a silly, but fun little bluffing game! Slide one of your insect cards (there are 6 different insects in the game) face down to another player, either saying truthfuly what the insect is or lying about it. Player can either say you are telling the truth, lying, or look at card and slide it to another player saying the same kind or another kind of insect. Anybody who does well at "reading" other players (poker players!) will do especially well at this.

One play (5-p).

It was the *tiniest* bit long with my group...my God - they even AP on me with Bug Bluff?!? That being said, I liked the fact that you can suck at bluffing (like me), but still survive as long as you're fairly good at reading other people...or are lucky. 

Funniest moment of the game was when people started passing along the card without even looking at it, resulting in moments such as this: 
"Frog." (passes card)
"It's a frog." (passes card w/o looking)
"Definitely a frog." (passes card w/o looking)
"Here's a frog for ya." (passes card w/o looking to last person)
"You bastards."

I look forward to playing with non-glacial types. I'm giving it a roll over Christmas with my family, and am predicting some big laughs.

I like the artwork a lot, but the cards are a bit slippery for my liking.

--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
Cockroach Poker is a simple bluffing game. In it players are dealt an equal share of a 64 card deck. The deck contains 8 different bugs, each with 8 cards. The start player chooses a card, slides it over to another player and states "This is a _____" They can tell the tell the truth or lie about what is actually on the card. The player it's passed to has two options; 
1.) Try to call if the person is lying or telling the truth - if they are correct the other player takes the card face up in front of them. If they are wrong, they get the card in front of them. 
2.) Pass the buck - otherwise known as the chicken move. You pick the card up, look at it, then slide the card to another player(that has not already had the card passed to them) stating the process all over again.
In this game only one player loses. A player loses if they have four matching cards face up in front of them or a player has no card to pass when they are required to do so.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have a gripe with the cards. Seven of the eight bugs are easily identifiable. The 8th card always seems to cause confusion'; 
"That one bug." 
"Which one bug?" 
"The green one."
"The frog is green."
"No, the other green card."
That doesn't seem like that big of a problem, but if you can't remember the bug it's a lot harder to use it in a lie. It's a slight flaw, and perhaps I am just knit picky and I need to play with smarter people that can remember all the bug names.

My big problem is that this game is real fragile. This game is meant to be fast. Sure, you can grind someone's gears by taking your time making a decision if you are going to make a call on them, but it's fun to watch someone twist in the wind. The problem is when someone needs to pick a card to pass and they then look at their hand for close to a minute before picking one and sliding it over. It kills the pace of the game and this game needs pacing because if you aren't card receiver or card giver, you have nothing to do except wait. All the fun tension is robbed by slow play and you are left just hating the experience. Also, table talk is a must. If you get into an anti-social group this game gets it's balloon popped. When people at the table aren't talking it's just a group of people sitting and starring off while two people play a game.

It also can overstay it's welcome. One play is fine(although with a slow player even one play can feel like eternity.) Two plays is asking for trouble. Three times just means you are suicidal. The game nights I brought this to had a significant amount of trouble seeking people.

Now, there is fun in this box. With the right play group it is pretty a fun, quick, simple game, filled with tension/laughter filled moments. Like when someone begrudgingly looks at a card to pass it only to find out their instincts were right, giving away what the card is and making a hysterical moment where they have to pass a card knowing the rest of the table knows exactly what it is. Or when someone, for some reason or another has no cards in front of them so you make it your life's goal to change that... being boisterous about it(How famous would Don Quixote be without windmills to fight?)

Sadly, in my experience, those fun plays are far fewer then the broken, borderline painful ones where a table is stuck starring at a single player mull over their hand with nothing to do. 

If you are playing with Rusty's homemade child sweat shop deck this game jumps from a low 4's rating to a solid 6. The deck has character and a story behind it, so their is some draw to the game before it even stops. Also, no other deck I know of has a "groin trauma" card.

What a cool game.  This is clearly one of those games that benefits from the right crowd, and I imagine it could fail miserably in the wrong setting.  It needs to be played quickly and with a sense of humor.

What a strange one, almost tempted to say this is not a game at all, just pure 50/50 bluff/guess without any supporting information to help you guess either way.

That being said, it did have us giggling and you can't ask for much more in a short filler. Probably wont be a regular fixture but it might come out from time to time.

Update: Keeps coming out, keeps us giggling. Definitely too simple to be called a game but lots of fun.

I really don't like bluffing games, and this game is almost pure bluffing.  You have a slight amount of strategic information based on the cards in your hand and those already played to the table, but you usually just pass a card and hope for the best.  Liar's dice and Pow Wow are much better bluffing games.

Top shelf bluffing game right alongside Skull.  It forces direct interaction and bold claims with no fat.  The only issues I have is that there's a strong incentive to keep passing cards to the player with the least amount of cards in hand to edge them towards defeat.  This isn't enough to ruin the experience though.

I think this bluffing game is good because it's so simple. Coup might be a step up in strategy, but this game is great just to see who is good at lying (or not!)

This one is a crowd pleaser. We were playing a super light card game night. Firstly, we played Exploding Kittens. Then we played Cockroach Poker. Then someone requested a second game of Cockroach Poker. Then we played Age of War. Then someone request a third game of Cockroach Poker. Then we played Bohnanza. Then someone else requested a fourth game of Cockroach poker, followed by a request for a fifth. That about says it all.

I liked the bluffing aspect. I liked passing around the cards. There was a lot of laughter while we played; it was funny to see someone guess wrong.

However, I don't want to play this game again. Why not? Because it encourages picking on the person who falls behind. With only one loser, as soon as someone is behind, the rest of the players pick on them until they lose, which, quite frankly, is boring. Strategically, it's the best move, but it's painful to watch and be a part of. By which I mean, I feel like an asshole for doing it. And I don't play games to feel like an asshole.

It might be possible to have a good one loser everyone else wins game, but this isn't it. When we played, as soon as someone fell behind, everyone picked on them until they lost. 

And years later, I find it. Pairs is that good one loser everyone else wins game.

I held off on this game for a really long time, not knowing if it'd be worth adding yet another light bluffing game to my collection... but this ended up being one of my favorites!

I can't emphasize enough how much fun and how funny it is to do things like: Passing your friend Jimmy, who has 3 Rats, a Rat and saying "Could you pass this Stinkbug to Jane, please?" because Jane has 3 Stinkbugs, watching Jimmy pick up the card, look at it, hand it to Jimmy and say "It's a Stinkbug" - then hold your breath as Jane thinks and says "No it's not", flip it up, and execute your master plan all along - annihilating Jimmy and winning the game.

This gets my vote for best intro bluffing game, for sure.

Update: We've been playing this one for over a year now and it still makes me laugh HARD every time. I can't say the same for Skull or Welcome to the Dungeon. I think it's time for a 9.

~Gaming memory~
We played a game where I passed my friend Robert a Rat, and claimed it was a Bat. He flipped it up. "OH SORRY." I said "I MEANT RAT. MY BAD, I GET THEM CONFUSED."

Later Ryan passed Robert a Scorpion, and said it was a Rat. Robert believed him, and flipped it up. He used the same line - "My bad, I confuse them". - "Yeah," I agreed, "They both have those tails, and legs. They're basically the same animal. Exoskeletons..."

Later Ryan passed Robert a Scorpion, claiming it was a Stinkbug. Robert believed him, and flipped it up. "Oh did I say Stinkbug?" Ryan asked, "I meant [i]Sting[/i]bug. I call Scorpions Stingbugs."

Finally, Ryan passed Robert a card. "It's a Stingbug" he said, in a matter of fact voice. Robert met his gaze and struggled to keep a straight face, before he lost it. Then I lost it. Then Ryan lost it. Robert just gave up and looked at the card.

Very random at first, as there is next to no information on which to base a guess.  As the game progresses, it becomes more calculable and therefore amps up the doublethink on both sides.

Do you claim an animal that is most likely to be left.  Why did they claim an animal most likely to be left.  The end of the game generally becomes a staring contest.. waiting for the first player to blink.

A good introduction to the bluffing genre for any family of aspiring liars.

2011-02-25: 7>8 With 4 or 2 players, it's a faster, more exciting game. I'm not sure how good we are at reading people - I'd be interested to know the stats on how often folk lie, how often each person detected the truth and how often each person correctly detected the lie.

In any case, it's a fun party game and can be amusing to note that one person lies 90% of the time...

2009-04-08: A unique party-game where success is determined by being able to read others.

Once I understood the basic rules, I enjoyed staring into people's eyes or using the available information to guess whether or not they were lying.

Unfortunately, it seemed like there was a fair bit of downtime (playing with 6) since there's little to keep track of or worry about on others' turns (other than seeing how they behave when lying or telling the truth if you don't know them well) and given the ability of folk to choose their targets, it's possible to either feel left out or be picked on.

Given the unique mechanic and the need to be able to 'read' your opponents, I think this would be ideal for a smaller group of family or close friends.

It really should be called Liar's Bugs - it's Liar's Dice with bugs instead of Dice.  Which makes it marginally better because it is quieter.  But, still not a good game choice for anyone incapable of lying convincingly and on the fly with no preparation.  I had the same problem with Mutiny on the Little Blue but that had more game to it.  

The cards are cute though - if you bought this game and don't like it, I recommend playing a modified version of Memory where you score 2 points per pair, 2 extra points per additional pair of the same type, and 10 additional points for each complete set of 8 different bug pairs.

Lovely, fast playing card game.  The deck of eight by eight suits is dealt out, and a card is passed face down to an opponent, accompanied by a statement as to what the card is.  That could be the truth, or a bluff.  The receiving player can call it, or peek and pass it on accompanied by a new statement.  And so it goes on, until the card is called and someone receives it (basically, if you call it incorrectly you receive it).  Four face up cards collected loses you the game, and everyone else wins. 

Wonderful stuff, with great non-gamer crossover appeal - should be a copy in every collection.

Simple but fun bluffing game.  Rules overview: http://chrisyeung.org/cockroach-poker/

We play with customized decks (e.g. 8 different vegetable cards taken from [gameid=32341] and [gameid=38391]; or cards from another game, e.g. Bohnanza beans), or even promotional grocery store cards.  

Also have made a customized deck of [gameid=129736] is a reimplementation which has 7 creatures instead of 8, and adds one "royal" card for each creature (if you take a royal creature you have to take an extra `penalty card' in front of you), plus 2 special black cards (one is a wild that counts as every creature, the other is a blank that counts as no creature). See discussion in [thread=851700]this thread[/thread].  The Royal version is probably more fun for gamers, but the simplicity of the original version probably makes it more accessible and better.

AKA Cockroach Poker.  Perfect suitcase size.

This is a light, filler, party, bluffing game, just the kind of game I don't like. But I am always searching for 6 (or more) player games and I read many good comments about this, so searched a long time till I found it.

The beautiful and appealing graphics make this game more enjoyable to play than I otherwise would find it.

I've only recently started sleeving cards, and not anxious to do so, but these cards cannot be marked in anyway or it will totally ruin the game, so I am not playing this again until it is sleeved.

I will suggest playing this a time or two to see how a full group likes it, but then I will probably leave it to them to suggest it.

Pros
-Can be decent party game
-Fast, easy to learn

Cons
-Boils down to 50/50 chance of losing a life each time it comes to you
-I can literally play this game with my eyes closed and not pay attention to anything that is happening (although doing so may improve my chances slightly)

Egy jópofa, nagyon egyszerű blöffölős kártyajáték, amiben azért lehet taktikázni is. Nem csak kártyaátadogatásról van szó, mivel végig kell gondolni, hogy kinek mit, milyen dumával érdemes adni, hogy semmi kedve se legyen kockáztatni egy visszapattintást vele kapcsolatban.

Nem tetszik benne, hogy nincs győztes, csak egyetlen vesztes.

Great filler, i wouldn't call it party game as many do. As you can take it seriously i think... there is a lot of hidden strategy coming into play and calculation within bluff is possible.
It also get better the more you play with the same people as you discover their bluffing strategies... there's more to this game than first meet the eyes.

This is the easiest game to teach that I know of. Plus, there's only one loser - meaning everyone else wins, sort of. And who doesn't like winning? Even if you lose, it's still funny. All in all, it's an excellent beginner's game. Despite the simple rules, I still enjoy it. Maybe I just like bluffing games since they enable clever play even with simple rules.

Great artwork - easy game, more fun than I expected. Easy to learn (about 1 minute). Ages 6+, although the youngest kids could use a card holder since the entire deck of 64 cards is dealt in the 3+ player game and 54 cards are dealt in the 2-player game. Usually, though, with 6-year-olds, they don't think much about the numbers of cards in hand or already played; they just like to play anything and try to bluff.

A simple bluffing game that doesn't really feel like it goes anywhere or does anything that interesting.  I find when playing with younger kids they just gang up on the near-loser, and that can be really frustrating for them.  With older folks, it just feels like an uninspired experience.  There's definitely a right way to play this game, but it's pretty easy to figure out the flow and what has to be done.  Maybe with the right group this could be fun; just not sure what the group would be!

Some of the grumpy comments here puzzle me. This plays quickly and is an excellent bluffing game, particularly when a card gets passed around multiple times and/or when you’re dealing with players who are really good at *looking* like they’re lying. In any case, play with relatives & close friends. If you find it boring, it’s because you or your group are being boring. Loosen up. Get to know each other, and lie through your teeth.

Ugly artwork but that doesn't matter. The game is all about bluffing and trying to confuse the player after you because you want to get rid of your cards and avoiding to get the ones from other players by guessing if they tell you the truth or lie. So it's not game itself that is fun but the way you interact with your fellow players to perceive what card they really try to pass to you. Ok as a filler to me otherwise i am not interested in this game.

Legjobb része az, amikor anyuka/apuka mondja gyermekének: "Te nekem nem hazudnál.", és ... :D
Nagyon tetszenek a kártyákon lévő rajzok is.
Kipróbáltuk a "last man standing" verziót is, ami nekem nagyon tetszett, azonban lényegesen megnövelheti több játékos esetében a játékidőt.

Cockroach Poker is simple bluffing card game that focuses more on the psychology than the card play. Players get a hand of cards depicting various undesirable critters. A player will pass one of these cards face down to another player of his/her choice. They will declare which critter the card depicts. The receiver can say "truth" or "lie" and if correct, will put the card face up in front of the giver. If incorrect, the card is placed face up in front of the receiver. Collect three of the same card, and you lose. The receiver does also have the option to simply look at the card and pass it on to someone else. This chaining of possible truths and lies is pretty interesting.

The cards themselves are nicely illustrated with rats, roaches, aphids, bats, scorpions, etc. in a dark cartoon style that looks great. Each card has a unique illustration of the animal in question, which is a nice touch. It comes in a sturdy box with a lid, which should be much more durable than a tuckbox.

I'd be happy to play this almost any time. I don't think it is as interesting of a game as some other bluffing games of its ilk such as Skull & Roses or Liar's Dice/Perudo/Bluff, but it is simpler in some ways, which might make it more accessible.

Simple and evil: all you do is determine whether someone is lying to you or not when they pass you a card, or you can peek at the card and try to fool someone else as you pass it to them. Best when the players know each other well.

It killed when I brought it home at Christmas to play with my family, and most everyone I play with asks where they can get a copy.

Dropped to an 8, as it can descend into 50-50 results if players aren't fully engaged [u]with each other[/u]. Still best with family or longtime friends; when playing with strangers you really need the right group.

This game is hilarious. My group loves bluffing/lying games and this game is all about making your friends believe the lie, even if that lie is that you're telling the truth. It takes about two minutes for people to start cracking up as people either believe or don't believe their friends. And we'll often times play it again immediately. It's a staple "in-between games" game and despite a theme that may not go over well with everyone, ends up a crowd pleaser.

Fun, easy to teach, very quick party-ish/social game of trying to guess whether a player is lying or not. Just about the perfect thing to bring out if you have 6+ players and want something you can all play quickly together, say, at the end of a game night or at a con. (The box says 2-6, but I've played with as many as 8.) In this game one player loses and everyone else wins, and somehow that just gets everyone laughing in a light-hearted schadenfreude-y way. 

An interesting variant I've not yet tried is that if someone manages to collect one of every critter (an octfecta?), they win.

Homemade version: 8 cards of 8 different colors (water-colored peices of paper stuck in card sleeves) for a total of 64 cards.

My (then) 6 and 8 year old loved it, and always seem to kick dad's butt at it.  I learned that my 6yo can lie like nobody's business.  must learn her tells.  must play more.

Given the above, the game can be a bit cut throat.  On every turn you're basically trying to screw over one of the other players by giving them cards.  Because of this, people that don't like confrontation might not like the game.  There is also the possibility that one player (dad) can get "ganged up" on by the other players.

My kids call this "the lying game".

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2014)

What a surprise game. When I read the rules I felt cheated because they are dead easy and the game didn’t appear to be fun. I’m very glad I was wrong, Kakerlaken Poker was a surprise smash hit for me and my friends. After Coup, this is the best bluffing game I have ever played, also it put the designer on my radar (Jacques Zeimet, I also like his Ghost Blitz and Tarantel Tango designs).

Lovely art. 

The game can be explained under 1 minute and (often) played under 6 minutes. However it is lots of fun. At first it appeared it was just guesswork, but a couple of friends showed me that wasn’t the case. The player who bluffs (or detect bluffs) the best will win. We laugh a lot with this one, definitively a keeper in my collection. Also like that there is only one loser, with most of the games that isn’t the case (obviously) so it feels fresh and unusual.

It is great with family or non-gamers as well. But all of my gamers friend have liked the game. With more plays I upgraded the rating. I won´t say no to a game of Kakerlaken Poker.

Current Rating: 7.0

I have played the game a lot lately. I still enjoy it but I no longer have a high desire to play Cockroach Poker. I still think it is an ok game to play with the family and non-gamer friends. It is also a hilarious and unique game. I don’t think I will get rid of it but I’m downgrading its rating.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games that is hard to figure out by simply reading the rules and is almost impossible to imagine actually working.  The gameplay is so simple, and at times I find myself thinking that the game is pure guesswork.  But after having played it a few times, some people seem to really be able to read opponents very well and can call one's bluff with amazing ease.  It's really pretty amazing.  Most gamers would probably immediately dismiss this game, but I find it intriguing and a lot of fun with the right group.

The rules and components are simple, but the gameplay is amazingly deep. I do wish the cards didn't come damaged, or that they were a standard size so I could sleeve them to hide the defects.

A really weird guessing game. Essentially the entire game is just bluffing and figuring out bluffs, but without much thought. And because this game is way too long, I don't see myself playing it again... ever... even on booze.

Awesome game. When I first heard about it I thought 'A game with only one loser and everybody else is the winner? I'm not so sure I'd like that.' What you soon realize though is that everyone is desperate to not lose which results in ganging up on people and watching hilarity ensue.

A really nice bluffing game that looks cool. The game becomes wonderfully interesting when the creatures start to crawl into the game and you're there sitting with three pieces of at least two different creatures. Possible problem is that if you're losing the game the others are probably giving you first offers more than to the other players, therefore adding to the stress.

I played about 10 games of this with non-gaming family members. It's decent but I don't really feel compelled to play again. It's pretty light with a lot of guesswork. There is some skill involved though in knowing who to try and trick with what. There is a file here on BGG to use this game to play Skull and Roses.

Bring your best Poker Face and funny bone for lotsa laughs with the right crowd...  

There are 8 cards of 8 types of bug-related creatures.  The idea is simple, pass a card and attempt to trick the other player(s) by lying or telling the truth.  Bring your best poker face.  For me, this is good as a fun party game experience, with the right group.  It's a bit like poker with regards to the bluffing aspect but a much more purer form of bluffing.  You mostly have to rely on reading your opponent/friend.  It's not a bad game if you like this type of pure bluffing party game but I'm not fond of replaying it as frequently as, for example, Texas Hold'em Poker.  This is lots of fun with the right players every once in awhile.

Simple bluffing game.  Everyone has a hand of cards with different animals depicted on them in cartoon form.  You say the name of the animal on your card, and pass it to another player face down.  They then say "true" if they think you're telling the truth about the animal on the card.  On the other hand, they might say false, if they think you're bluffing.  If they guess correctly you put the card face up in front of yourself.  If they guess incorrectly they put the card face up in front of themselves.  The other option is to look at the card, say an animal type, and pass it on to someone else.

Players aren't trying to win so much as not lose.  The first player to either run out of cards in their hand, or get four cards of the same animal type in front of them loses.  Everyone else wins.

It's a fun little game that works well as a filler, or as a game for the lunch break at work.  Try it out!

This is a great bluffing game.  The instructions are a bit confusing, but once we worked it out the game play was great.  The 2 player game is quite fun also.  I think the rules should say deal out the cards evenly, and place the remaining cards back in the box.
A great cockroach game :) Love it, even when I lose

Other bluffing games have 'gameplay' or 'theming' to tie everything together. Cockroach Poker throws that all away, and gives you a game that is entirely composed of direct confrontational lying. 

The game doesn't really heat up until one person has three cards of one type, and there's also a tendency for everyone to gang up on one or two players, but overall it's a fun bluffing game with some cool looking bugs.

Also, try not to lose cards, because it throws off all sorts of probability calculations.

Bluffing game. The cards are amazingly pretty, unfortunately the game isn't that good. Still, it's a decent game for the whole family and a pretty good filler for gamers who enjoy bluffing.

Indifferent.

Played 3 times, including 1 loss (only 1 player loses - everyone else wins!).  This is a great game.  Fits a good niche for me.  Plays up to 6 which is nice.  Not too long, usually, so a nice filler.  I have yet to play a game that didn't cause riotous laughter.  It's pure bluff.

The artwork really adds a lot, in my opinion.  Each bug has 8 cards, of the same color but the pictures are all a bit different which is a nice touch.

2 éve Karácsonyra kaptam, utána szilveszterkor ezzel az egy játékkal játszottunk, de vagy 4 órán át!! Ez mindent elmond! Az egész játék nem szól másról, csak röhögésről. Aki nem tud jól blöffölni, az is imádja. Egyszerű és gyors, és jöhet a következő parti!
Talán kicsit magas az ára (nyilván az illusztrációk miatt).

I like the pure bluffing element of this game and see it as being a great warm up to a night of deception in one of the many other fine but more substantial deception games. I like it's purity and the layers upon layers of depth in strategy that could be used. It seems more useful, unless you're truly skilled, to go by calculation of liklihood of them lying and they're previous patterns and pattern breaks rather than simply if they SEEM like they're lying or not which is much harder.

[b]Cockroach Poker[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I play with a few different groups, including my family, and each group plays this game differently. Certain bugs become taboo because of what has happened in previous games. My kids also figured out pretty quickly to pass specific cards around so that the last person is faced with a very difficult choice which could lead to them losing.

The fact that all of this naturally emerges from such a simple rule set is what makes this game brilliant and instantly accessible to everyone. There is nothing tacked on or convoluted. As much as I love Coup there is still a slight barrier to entry with people who don't game much. In fact even in one of my groups a few people really don't like the "heavier" bluffing games but love Cockroach Poker.

This game is a keeper and one I would recommend adding to anyone's collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- My favorite bluffing game!
- Great gateway into bluffing games, I have been able to play this with lots of different people. 
- I am using this game as a stepping stone to eventually teach my wife and kids Coup (which is my favorite bluffing game).
- Plays fast, but there is definitely an interesting meta game that develops if you play with the same people.
- Great artwork![/i]

It's funny because after reading the rules of the game I was not convinced it would be at all good. It really is so very straightforward and simple. It can be explained in a few sentences, which mind is not always a bad thing. But it does no justice to how much fun the actual game can be. Skull and Roses is definitely in the same family as this game, but I think this game does it better. There is more agency for one, you are less tied to turn order, and you can strategize. Some people might dislike the "everyone-wins-but-you" rule but I lost our first play and honestly it was still tons of fun. Its climatic until that point, as the pressure mounts when more creepy-crawlies gather in front of you. You feel like a large bullseye is on you when get three of any one type of creature. You can feel like a boss when you suss out the truth from lies too. Greg got on quite a roll for a while there.

A humorous game of bluffing! Simple and quick filler for 2-players or for the family! When I first read the rules I was concerned I might not like the game...but, immediately upon playing the bluffing mechanic caught us all as very funny!

Choose a card...tell the truth or bluff! If your opponent guesses wrong about your card he keeps it and if he guesses right you keep your card! If any player gets 4 of the same insect they loose!

A surprisingly fun bluffing game that I wasn't expecting to enjoy. Lots of good decisions on whether to accept or pass on a card, believing or not believing it's what's declared, the decisions affected by all that's gone on before. And it finishes in the right amount of time. Only not a higher rating because it's nothing but bluffing.

I bought this game because it was really original.  I was a bit worried that play would be random, or that some people wouldn't be able to read others and be really bad at it, but neither turned out to be true.  Some folks were better at it than others, but not too much.

Overall, it was definitely fun, did require some skill reading other people, and it's even a little stressful!

This is a fun bluffing game. The idea is you take a card from your hand and play it to another player face down and tell them what's on the card. You can lie. They then chose if they want to look at the card then pass it to another player who hasn't seen it yet, and then THEY can say whatever they want, or they can make a guess if the player who handed it to them is lying or not. If they guess right it counts against the player who sent it to them. If they guess wrong it counts against themselves. I would love this game with a different theme. The art didn't do much for me.

Bought purely because of a lack of ultra light filler in my games cupboard. Worth a laugh, but outstays its welcome if played longer than 10 minutes. I like bluffing games and with the artwork devoid of symbols or numbers, there's plenty of room for house rules. Expect my daughter and friends to enjoy this in a few year's time.

Update: We now stop once a player has three of a kind in from of them, rather than four. Far quicker and, as a result, more fun. Upped the rating as we're playing this as our number one filler.

This is an excellent game of pure bluff. On paper it doesn't sound like much, but it outdoes the other similar bluffing games in a few ways. One is that you always have to make a decision, there is no choosing to accept the bluff and play on: every card will be called. The players are differentiated by where they are vulnerable. This then interacts with the table psychology in interesting ways: tackle them head on to knock them out, offer them a option that is safe for both of you, etc etc.  Great artwork and simple rules make this a fun game that can be played by all ages and at any desired level of competitiveness.

This is a great game, most of the time, but it has two flaws: one, it can go on too long (usually because someone sits there saying "This is too slow" while simultaneously taking ages to take their turn), and two, there is no winner. There should be a winner. Answer: turn the rule around so that the winner of a challenge takes the card instead of the loser, and thus the game is won by the person with four of a kind instead of lost. Simples!

superb bluffing game, with just enough information to provide something to bluff about but not so much that it turns into true deduction.

caveat: the game breaks down with larger player counts (e.g. 6 and maybe 5) once players recognize a degeneracy.  It is optimal for all but one player to gang up on one player and make them lose, thereby making the gang all win.  This is easy to do by just targeting them with cards a lot.  Unless they get every bluff right, they will get worn down, but their retaliation will be spread out.  Even against very good players, this is almost guaranteed to work, and there is no in-game reason not to do it.  I can't unsee this strategy, and it ruins the game for me.  So, I will only play it with 3 or 4.

fix:  To make it work well with more, add the rule "If a player loses by running out of cards, then anyone with any cards matching a card in front of the losing player also loses.".  That prevents ganging up and actually adds another layer of information to guide second guessing.

Played this twice. A simple bluffing game where you have to guess what's on your opponent's mind. If you enjoy looking at the expressions and behaviour of other players to give you clues, you would enjoy Kakerlakenpoker's gameplay. Also, towards the end, you can estimate the likelihood of a certain creature being in your opponent's hand by comparing it with those in play and in your hand. The rating for this is dragged down by the long playing time - it's quite a challenge dumping 4 of the same creature on one person, and the novelty always seems to wear off for me after 20 minutes or so.

RATING: 5.5
Not one for everyone: but scales up to 6.

Players have a hand of cards depicting pests (there are 8 including spiders, rats etc). A player leads and passes a card to any other player face down, saying what it is. Said player can call a bluff or look at the card and pass it on another player either saying it's the the pest the previous player called out or something else.

This goes on until the last player is passed the card. He/she then has to call the bluff. If it's right, the player who passed the card gets it place face up in front of them as a penalty. If it's wrongly called, the caller (?) gets the penalty. First to 4 of one kind of penalty card loses. The rest win.

Works with the right group and provides some laughs but one game I played ran for over an hour...long outstaying its welcome.

Resembling poker only by bluffing your opponents, this game can be a blast with the right crowd. It can be downright hilarious watching player after player pass a card while deciding to continue a lie or tell the truth. I give it a 6 for the game and a 10 for the interaction and laughter it can bring to the table...so 8 as an average score.

Our group are filthy liars that hate losing. Filthy, filthy liars. This game is perfect in that environment.

One of those games that I loved and immediately wanted a copy knowing I'd never get it played at home.

It is confronting, you stare a person in the face and lie to them. You abuse things they know about you, you betray their trust, their friendship, and you destroy any faith they have in humanity.

"It's a bat..."

And then you wait, and now you are both sweating. Did you do enough? Did you put the right amount of hesitation? Did you pick the right person at the table for this card? Finally they glance at it and sweet relief rushes over you. Now it is on them to betray someone and for a few seconds you are safe.

You hear them say:
"It really is a bat..."

And you smile. It is a bat and you know someone who badly doesn't want a bat...time to act suspicious.

Glorious fun.

Pure bluffing game. With no real winner and only one loser, it's more of a filler, but a good one that doesn't overstay its welcome, especially since you can house rule it shorter if necessary.

RATING: 7
A light fun game, best played late at night when you're really tired. The illustrations are very cute, and their is a lot of humor in the bluffing/calling ... but it's silly humor. I also don't prefer games with only one loser!

--- Summary ---
The deck has 8 types of pests, 6 cards each. Deal out all the cards as evenly as possible. Player to left of dealer passes a card face down to any other player, naming one of the pests. The recipient either looks at it and passes it to another player (who has not received the card this round), naming any pest, or "calls". If calling, announces whether he thinks the passing player was lying or not. Whichever player is wrong (e.g., bluffing player if you think it's not the named pest) adds the card face up to their display and leads next. A player loses immediately (and all other players win) if they cannot lead a card or if they have 4-of-a-kind in their display.

There is some inherent cruelty in a game that resolves with no winners, just one loser. I like it, but it is very dependent on the group. In one game, a few loved it, a few found the bluffing and judging to be stressful, and one didn't see the game in it at all.

[Drei Magier Spiele 2004 edition] {Animal, party; bluffing; optimal 4-8p} Bug bluff is a cheerful lying card game, in the line of "Contraband".  The bug theme is interesting and integrates with the game well; esp. for those who are afraid of bugs :)  The cards are nicely produced with hilarious art work though some may find them disgusting. (Drei Magier is capable of producing high-quality games for kids.)

Bluffing is the major required skill. Another skill is to read people so that you can know the 'weakness' of particular players. Then, you can let them help you to pass cards or escape.

Although each turn is the same, the game time is just right before players feel bored. It's especially exciting when one player has a set of 3 cards and is about to lose. It's cheerful and exciting to look at the players and challenge them to see if they are lying.  Players are often yelling "oh no!" when they are cheated :laugh: 

However, like other social games, the fun will deteriorate when the same group played it for many times because players will be familiar with how other lies or thinks.

This game works well for what it is: some sort of light game that can accommodate a variable number of players say 4-8 or maybe more? I hesitate to call it filler only because it takes a little longer (say 25 min) than most games that I consider filler. It's a pretty good bluffing game but my main issue is that: there is no winner! Only a loser. Really this sort of kills a lot of the strategy an interest for me, as a strategy game. As a fun way to kill 20 min or so, it's fairly effective. The other issue is the process is repetitive, it's the same action over and over, nothing really changes from the beginning the middle or end. It is fun and easy to play, which one must not underestimate. But it sort of falls down as a game when it comes to the narrative aspect of a game and/or strategic concerns.

Simple games that accomplish their game designs point are much easier to rate higher than it is to rate a complex boardgame simply because there are so many different things that can go wrong in the bigger game that would cause the overall rating to drop. This is the reason that when you see a complex boardgame with a high rating = BUY IT, because it has achieved something tremendous and is wholly deserving of your attention.

Such a bad game. I was really hoping this would be on the same level as Coup, but it's nowhere near that level.

You can barely call Cockroach Poker a bluffing game. It's more like a guessing game. In Coup, and even Liar's Dice, you have at least some information to work with to help figure out how likely it is that someone is lying. In Cockroach Poker you really have no information. This results in people just passing around cards and completely randomly calling out "true" or "false."

Update: Play Seventh Hero instead. If uses the same basic system but vastly improves the game.

I find that this brings out the competition and bluffing just as strongly as BSG or Panic Station, and yet is just a small and silly little deck of cards.

Maybe it's just the crazy/awesome people that I play with...

I was convinced to play this game with the phrase "...and Bryan will hate it!" I didn't have any idea what to expect at all, but with an introduction like that how can you go wrong?

For some reason, I just assumed there would be lots of ugly pictures of cockroaches in the game. I was pleasantly surprised by the artwork. Even though the game is focused on various types of vermin, the art is beautiful. I'd be tempted to pick this game up just on visual appeal.

The game itself is super simple. You pick a card from your hand and put it face down in front of another player. You make a claim on what the card is. They can accuse you of lying or agree that you're telling the truth, and if they're right the card goes into your tableau. If they're wrong it goes into theirs. Alternatively, they can look at the card and then pass it on to someone else, adding their own claim about what the card is. There are no winners in the game, but the first person to get four of a kind or to have no cards to pass to another player loses.

I really enjoyed the game. There are any number of bluffing games out there, but a lot of them build a complicated game around the bluffing element. Cockroach poker strips away almost everything that would be extraneous and focuses just on the bluffing element. I much prefer this to something like Coup, where the bluffing element is propped up on an awkward economic system.

This game also achieved something I've never experienced in Coup... it was fun. The best moment for me was a showdown I had with Matt. I was determined to stick him with a card, so I repeatedly played cards in front of him, claiming they were bats, pretty much randomly deciding to lie or tell the truth each time. About thirty seconds and six correct guesses later, the entire table was laughing and I had a pile of cards in front of me. It was hilarious, even though it completely wrecked me.

I think the artwork, theme and simplicity of this game would make it replace Liar's Dice for my kids.

[thing=11971][/thing] is super simple game: in his turn the player chooses a card from his hand and passes it over, face down, to someone else at the table while also saying what the card is (for instance "it is a bat") - the player can lie or not about what type of card he is passing. The person that receives the card then has two options: accept the card or refuse it. If he [u][b]accepts[/b][/u] it, he must say if the card is what was told to him (a bat) or if it isn't. If the receiver gets it right (it wasn't a bat and he said so), the card returns to the player that passed it and stays, face up, in front of him. If the receiver gets it wrong (it was indeed a bat and he said it wasn't), the card stays with him, now face up. If the person [u][b]refuses[/b][/u] the card, he looks at it, without showing it to the others, and passes it to someone else, and this new receiver will have the same two options (accept or refuse).

Play goes like this until someone accepts it or until the card reaches the last player at the table that hasn't seen yet the card in question - this person will have to accept the card, saying if it is or isn't what the player that passed it said it was.

The person that ended up with the card in front of him (either because he got it wrong about which type the card was or because it returned as the receiver got it right) will be the one that starts the next round.

The game ends as soon as:
- someone has 4 card of the same kind revealed in front of him (there are 8 types of different cards, all with 8 cards each);
- when someone is out of cards in his hand to start a next round.

Whatever it was the trigger for the game to end, the person that reached the condition is the loser, and everyone else wins.

[thing=11971][/thing] proved itself as an easy game to learn and to teach. It is also fun, with its gameplay based mostly on light - but important - bluff. Take a card, looking at it and saying "no, it is really a Cockroach" seems pretty easy, however, to do it properly, keeping a straight face while doing, was harder than expected. Not hard in the sense of complicated stuff or deep strategy, no - it is in the sense of staying with a serious face while trying some mind foolery, as more than once somehting like this happened:

Receives the card - "It is a Worm". Looks at the passing player. Can't read him as he smiles. Refuses the card and looks at it. Damn, he was right: it wasn't a worm. Too late now. He decides to pass the card to the player with already two worms revealed. He thinks saying it is a worm might be the way to go. He passes the card and says "It is a Wo-" (changes his mind mid-play) "no, wait, is a Dog". There is no Dog in the game, someone says while laughing out loud. "Yes, no, I mean, a Spid-ah, no, a Fly! Ah, fu*&." And while this might seem like a bad play, it actually, in [thing=11971][/thing], works like a charm, as really, the receiving player definitely knows that the passing player is lying, but about what now? He might had started saying the truth, than stop, tried to lie, failed miserably, got confused by the laughs and the absence of Dogs, tried to continue with the lie, then didn't liked the option and changed it. But what if at some point of this mess he was saying the truth and decided not to? Mind = blown.

Anyway, everyone that played, liked it, and one said she would bought it as soon as possible. A play will last around 30 minutes, but can go a lot faster. Beign so portable and since it accomodates up to six players, [thing=11971][/thing] will probably have a strong presence in our gaming nights.

Played with four - would be better with 5-6 most likely

100% bluffing game with a twist - you can pass a card along OR you can choose to say the person passing to you is either lying OR telling the truth and, if right, they put the card in front of them (i.e. lose that round)

It was interesting for the fact that you can say the person is lying OR telling the truth and hose them

Really pure bluffing - and had us laughing enough that we had to play it twice back-to-back

Nothing heavy or really nothing to deduce (like resistance) but was still fun for something light....

I'm not normally a fan of bluffing games, but I was immediately taken by the "chain of deceit" that this game sets up, along with general ease of play. Like ONUW, you don't have to lie for long, and trying to untie the knot that is "which of these people who have seen the card are lying?" makes for a rollicking experience.

Not a ton of game here, but just enough to be good fun with the right group and/or level of tiredness.  Should be played as something between a game and an activity: it's not very good if you're purely focused on winning and only giving cards to one player all game, but you should still be trying to figure out bluffs and do well.

WAT

If this came out from Hasbro, nobody would ever have looked twice at it.  Because it has the small German publisher in the mid 2000s cred, it got some traction in the gaming community.  It doesn't deserve it.

As a game, it's a miserable failure.  There's almost nothing but bluff here, with very little information to go on.  As a result, it's nothing but reading your opponent.  There are scads of better games using this idea, including several public domain games.  Go for [gameid=45], [gameid=92415], or [url=http://www.kahnhome.org/thorin/Games/LiarsPoker.htm]Liar's Poker[/url] instead.

'Cockroach Poker' is a filler style game based around eight different types of 'bug' where each player attempts to avoid obtaining four 'bugs' of one of these categories through bluff and deceit. Cards are passed around to opponents, stating what card they want it to be or even exactly what it is. It is then for that receiving player to choose one of two options. If unsure, they look at the card and then pass it on and can retain or change the designation of the card. Alternatively, they can guess if the card is correct or not, by simply stating this as the option. Should they guess correctly, one of two things happens. If the card is correctly identified, it goes back to the original passing player. If not, it goes face up in front of the player who guessed incorrectly. This continues until one player has four 'bugs' of the same type, at which point, they lose and everyone else wins. Simple. A card version of 'Call My Bluff'.

This is strictly a game of bluffing, so non-fans of that type of game should steer clear of it.  It's also an everybody-but-one-player-wins game, so if you're not a fan of those types of games, then steer clear.  I'm a fan of the former (though many other games already do a much better job of capturing the tension of bluffing games), and not so much of the latter, but I've only played the game with three players so far.  I imagine it's a very different experience with the full complement of six players.  I'll give it a chance with that number before I make my final decision about this game.

LOVE the artwork. The colours are so rich and vibrant and the box is gorgeous orange. The critters are ugly but cute and cheeky.

RATING: 7
The ultimate filler bluffing card game. Better with more players. Don't play with people who have ESP. 8 cards of 8 critters. Name a critter and the next player calls you, says you speak the truth, or looks at it to name a critter for the next player. Guarantee you will not get why this is any big deal until you realize the raw essence of an uncertain truth and an unconvincing lie. Novel concept that you are playing not to lose. I believe this would be good sparring equipment for aspiring texas hold'em tourney players. Played enough, you start spotting the tells of your friends, spouse or family, and they start to figure out yours...so be warned.  It never gets old watching new players expressions when they get burned for being truthful--doh.

The "one loser" idea is sweet, but easily abused.  A single player can get piled on repeatedly if the group is in a vindictive mood.

If played fairly and randomly, it's decent fun - but only because it's rather short.  Don't dawdle and you won't hate playing.

And there is some strategy on what to pass and who to target, which doesn't hurt.

Played a few times (with 4 to 7 players). A nice bluffing game, short and simple enough for new players to enjoy. It may suffer from a slight targetting problem, which may lead some players to be involved much more than others, but that is a minor drawback.

This just works, somehow. It's all bluffing, double-bluffing, and trying to read each other, but it works, and is funny as heck with good friends. It works equally well with casual players, and gamers, but I may prefer it with the latter for the fun logics people try to apply to the game. A casual player, or young child not used to losing, can take being the lone loser a bit hard, but this is such a quick game that an immediate rematch should cure sore feelings.

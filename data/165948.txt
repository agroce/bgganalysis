Fun game with a fun theme, you're building huts on an island, trying to get the best placement to score the most points.  Interesting role selection phase at the start of every round.

RATING: 6.5
Fairly well done with lovely components. I felt it didn't play well with 2 and didn't interest me enough to play with more. The mechanic of determining the area where one could play felt artificial. Picking up cards is rather uninteresting. The action selection area was tense and felt right although also some actions are clearly better than others. The column and row scoring concept wasn't that intriguing to me. So overall, fair game but not outstanding.

Possibly the best gateway game I have played! My only real complaint (apart from my usual one about an utter lack of theme) is how short Mangrovia is: at game end, you're left thinking, "Wait! We were just getting started!"

Gioco solido.L'aspetto visivo è appagante.La meccanica è molto semplice ed il tutto si sviluppa piu o meno in un'oretta.Diverse sezioni del tabellone danno diverse possibilità di strategia x accumulare punti anche se i punti veri li fanno la piazza delle pietre e le posizioni affianco ai totem.Gioco molto tattico quindi.Consigliato x le famiglie.:-)

Mangrovia assembles some familiar things: area control, worker placement, drawing cards a la Ticket to Ride, a bit of tension between scoring a little now and the possibility of scoring more later.  As area control games go, it's as straightforward as they come - no movement, no elimination, no wandering King, just adding pieces and trying to outnumber your opponents.  The difficulty lies in getting the right combinations of cards and amulets to allow optimal placement.  However, in the early to mid-game, just getting as many huts on the board as possible doesn't seem a bad strategy.  In a similar way, the choice of actions seems too straightforward.  Short of cards?  Get some.  Plenty of cards?  Place huts.  Is it better to be able to draw two amulets rather than one?  Sure it is.  

Production quality is to Zoch's usual good standards.  My one complaint is about a decidedly abstract boat piece.  The artwork is easy on the eye.  The English rules are reasonably well written.

Mangrovia is a medium weight Euro combining area control with a little worker placement. You are essentially trying to score points my having the majority of your tribe's huts placed in certain areas of the board. You do that using a rondel-type worker placement. As the actions on that "rondel" go around every turn you get one action from one side and another action from the other aside. These actions enable you to build huts, draw cards that are needed to build the huts or rearrange the plots of land in which the huts can be built. There is a grid on the main board where you will score points for having the majority on the X axis and the Y axis. This was purchased at a friendly local gaming store by my wife while she was working out of town. She wanted a different type of Euro and this was suggested. And it was certainly a good suggestion. Not sure if it is getting a big print run anywhere but it you see a copy, give it a try.

Nice, but I had higher hopes. The game is so pretty, with vibrant colours and high quality components, but the game play did not pull me in. This could be because I only tried it with two players, it is quite possible that the game would improve with more. In fact, if you are looking for a fairly think but still quick playing game for 5 players, this could be it.

1 játék után: Hangulata kiváló és a játékmechanikával sincs semmi gond. Könnyed játék. Egyetlen kifogásolni valót találtam a játékban, mely miatt a 6-os értéket kapja tőlem. Az pedig az amulettek erőssége. Sajnos úgy érzem, hogy nagyon erős a játék megnyeréséhez, melyet a következő játéknál úgy kompenzálnék, hogy nem lehet válogatni, azaz visszadobni a leggyengébbet. A másik pedig az, hogy a kunyhókat egyenlőség alapján számszaki súlyozást kéne alkalmazni az értékelésnél, mejy ezen egyezőség esetén nyerne az előrébb lévő.

RATING: 4
A very mechanically "old" feeling design. There's a little bit of action selection, with actions mostly to draft cards and then play those cards to place huts on the board, with the huts largely being used for an end game area majority scoring.

Overall, it all works just fine, but there's no real spark here that makes the game shine.

Point salad the area majority game! Collect two different types of resources which you use to claim overlapping areas.

RATING: 4
An annoying and overly multiplexed majorities game. 'Annoying' because the interaction is all in the slow-as-molasses access to the majorities which really don't allow for varied approaches, and require people to go after the same things anyway. First a few cards here, then a few cards there, then hoping that the areas you are allowed to build on are allowed, and then hoping that what you [i]can[/i] build is actually beneficial towards your own position. It is just a grating experience, reminiscent of what goes on in Caylus where players too are spending many turns manoeuvring themselves into a position before they can actually [i]do[/i] something. 'Overly multiplexed' because of the unoriginal tabular nature to score the majorities. Seriously: in this game it is all about rows and columns, and two supra-tabular environments. Inspiration was certainly lacking here. And on top of it all, the game is set in a messy and uninspriring geographical environment most people would rather stay out of (a mangrove forest). All in all a title whose acquaintance I soon hope to forget.

Zoch are becoming a reliable source of strong gateway/family/gamer hybrids each year ([thing=137154][/thing] is a real classic from 2013, and Avanti and Tobago are pretty good too).

Mangrovia I really enjoyed and is as good if not better than all except [thing=137154][/thing].   It plays so smoothly with just the right amount of brain activity needed for a later evening session. There is sufficient randomness with the cards and the amulet bag draw to allow new gamers or families to compete equally.  

It isn't going to set the world alight, but it perfectly fills that gap when you want an easy to explain intuitive Euro to while away an hour on a Sunday Afternoon.  Recommended.

[b]Rating based on - 15 plays, 2 player[/b]
I really loved to play this game. First off, it looks stunning. Secondly the gameplay is easy and smooth, from how you decide what actions to go for, to how you decide where to build based on the plot cards and amulets/valuables in your hand. While I can see a lot of thought has been put into the 2 player experience, I can't recommend it for just 2. It's still VERY good at 2 but a couple issues made it not a keeper for us:
- from about play 5 I noticed that we always gravitated towards the same spots. Only 4/5 action spaces were interesting/useful to us (one is blocked by the dummy player) and it's always the same spot so it made the 'market' feel limiting and stagnant. It needs at least a third player to mix it up.
- amulets are powerful and swingy. In 13 of the 15 games we played, the person who got more (or the higher valued)  amulets won. In one game I concentrated on sole area control. I controlled the stone area, pole area, and the 6 highest scoring areas and my opponent still beat me because his amulets were mainly 5s and 6s. You don't necessarily have the cards to build in an amulet access spot to constantly match your opponent in building there so again I feel at least a third player to break this up is necessary.

It would be a 7, but it gains .5 for the thought and effort put into a workable 2 player area control game...of sorts...

RATING: 7.3
Jó kis játék ez, bár előzetes várakozásaimhoz képest elég absztrakt. A kiadó meg a szép kivitelezés miatt valami olyasmire számítottam, mint a tobago, de ez inkább egy kifejezetten absztrakt területi dominancia-szerzős játék. Nem nélkülözi a szerencsét sem, de gyorsan lemegy, szóval nem zavaró. Hármasban próbáltuk, tetszett, de kicsit félek tőle, hogy többen káoszba fullad. Fájdalmas lehet egy utolsó kör, aminek az elején építesz és jól is állsz, de a végére elvesztesz szinte minden többséget, mert úgy jön ki a lépés, de tenni már nem tudsz ellene. Ki kell próbálni, hogy valós-e ez a félelem.

Jól összerakott, szép, gyors, talán az ízlésemnek kicsit absztrakt játék, igen sok interakcióval.

I had high expectations for this one.  It was fine, but it felt like a core game with a bit too much chrome.  For example, there is a special rule for when a space shares two terrains, but there are only two spots out of maybe 40 on the board where this occurs.  The amulet system worked well, but seemed almost more powerful than the hut placement.

Played as a 2 player only.

To make it short, it's all about points. Whatever you do is going to give points, except for the actions to get the needed resources. Atleast there arn't a hundred differents ways to make points (like most "Feld" games nowadays), instead it's pretty much straight foward.

It works, it looks fine and I would call it a good family game, but nothing new or interesting for "gamers".

My second incursion into worker placement (WP) territory. El uso de WP es mínimo, solo en la selección de turnos, pero está integrado en las posibilidades estratéticas. El juego es en el fondo sobre control de área. Uno compite para convertirse en el jefe mayor entre las tribus; para lograrlo debe contruir chozas en lugares estratégicos de la selva que aumenten los valores de tus zonas. Si eres bueno los dioses de Mangrovia te regalan amuletos y recursos para potenciar tus habilidades de construcción de chozas. Juego para todas las edades, fácil de aprender y con un tablero bellísimo. The gameplay is very, very smooth.

Amulets are very strong, it's imperative that 1 or 2 players don't run away with all the red circle spaces, if they do then it's game over for everyone else.

This basically makes the first 1/3 of the game into a race for those spaces, there is no other option.

The rest of the game is a little more open in what you choose to do, which spaces/columns/rows to build on, and/or build in the two sets of 8 special squares, all depending on which bonuses you are going for, or think you can get/beat other players to.

Overall the game is a light-medium weight game with some strategy, but mostly tactical play, however the strength of the amulets kills the game for me, they force the game into 1 direction at the expense of anything else (otherwise the game is ok, nothing special though).

I really really like this game for a few reasons. It's obviously very attractive. It's very simple to teach, but there are great decisions to make. Each round you have to plan for yourself, but you need to be flexible if you're later in the turn order. You also can't quite tell who is winning until the end, and that keeps everyone really into the game right up to the end.

Action selection in Mangrovia happens in pairs. The action board is essentially a line, with actions on either side. You select a position on the line and take the left action as the "action boat" moves down one side and the right action when the boat returns up the other side. Actions involve drafting cards, drawing variable-valued artifacts from a bag, or using your cards and artifacts to build huts on the board. The board is essentially a large grid. You need a location card and cards or artifacts that match the exact value of the space in order to build. Most spaces give immediate points, but at the end having majorities in the primary 4 columns and rows also score points. There are two special areas (stone and pole areas) that additionally score with different criteria at game's end. The game ends at the end of the turn when one player runs out of huts to build.

Sounds not that much more difficult than Ticket to Ride, drafting cards in order to place pieces. However, because you need exact amounts and a space's value will change depending on whether it helps you with a majority makes the thinking involved and little more complex than getting a needed route segment first. This could make the game a little thinky for some kids, if you are looking for a family game. I'll play this a few more times, but I'm not sure there's enough here to hold my continued interest.

Very pleasant light-/medium weight Euro. On their turn, players choose one of six or seven action spots, each of them grants a specific combination of actions, e.g. get two cards and build one hut, get three cards and become start player, get two cards and draw from the sack. Ultimately, players build huts on the board to directly score points, win majorities, improve their skills to draw more goods from the sack. The challenge is in mastering the multi-dimensional scoring. On a first play Mangrovia leaves the impression that it’s finely balanced and developed. A positive surprise from Zoch.

Solid old school euro game. The rules appear to be full of small fiddly pieces about hut placement and scoring, but it all comes smoothly together when playing. The most exciting thing about the game is the worker placement phase and subsequent action execution filled with drafting of resources and property slots. The game starts to get a bit slow moving towards the end as the space on the board gets scarcer and players need to forward think their choices more thoroughly.

Mangrovia is the game that probably pushes me to rerate all my games.

It is a solid game and while I like the turnorder mechanism and the different ways of scoring  , all area majority but different, the game is so abstract that it is almost all there is.
This probably has to do with the fact that you draw your resources instead of making them on one spot and than trading them in on another spot.

Scores were close 82, 78 and 62.
Now i scored 78 and was blocking the player who could draw a lot of points out of the bag.
We all misconceived who was winning.

This is an interesting and fairly straightforward bowl placement where one reserves two actions with their bowl(s). Scoring is quite varied in different places so there appears to be quite a few different approaches one could focus upon in order to win.

This is a great family hut building area control game. Everyone I have played it with has enjoyed it. It has lovely artwork and great simple game play. 

The idea of placing ceremonial bowls around an island to choose turn order is great. Do you go early to get the best cards but then build last with those cards as the boat takes an age to sail round to the other side of the island indicating its your turn. Lovely decisions ... and birds of paradise! who would have thought they could be so mean! Always landing and selecting the type of land you don't want to build on. No problem just go first in the turn order and you can tell them where to land next turn .. but wait ... what do you mean I can't build a hut right now! bugger.

The area control comes in the need to have the majority in rows in front of totems (closer to the totem breaks ties) and two other separate areas. Add in amulets and other such goodness and it seems like there is a lot to explain but my youngest daughter picked it up straightaway.

If you are looking for a slightly advanced family game look no further, this is it.

You need to know that this game is completely theme-less, no matter what the colourful illustrations may try to sell. If your expectations are right, this is a decent number-crunching game. I´d be happy to play again, but it´s probably not a buy for me. It didn´t grab me.

Not really a family game as stated in a description. A light-to-mid-weight strategy game. Fairly light because of the rules but certainly deeper as far as strategy. Players are drafting cards and then vying for majorities in the rows and columns of grids. There are also some other ways to score with amulets, etc and a clever turn-order/worker placement phase that determines what you can do on both of your actions during the round. Found it to be quite competitive with some tough decisions to make.

Gyönyörű társas, és nagyon hangulatos. A játékmenetet is egészen egyedinek éreztem. Ugyanakkor szerencsésen jöttek a lapok a játék elején, beépítettem a téglakörös helyekre, feltápoltam magam amulettekből maximumra, és száz feletti pontszámmal majdnem megdupláztam a 2. helyezett eredményét.. Pedig a játék elején direkt felhívták a figyelmet az amulettek fontosságára és mindenki arra ment. De nekem jöttek a lapok is. Bár őszintén szólva úgy éreztem, hogy sikerült úgy alakítanom, hogy nekem legyen jó, persze néha a vakon húzás is bejött..
A hangulata mindenesetre elvarázsolt, a játékmenet is érdekes, de a fentiek miatt bizonytalan vagyok abban, hogy hosszabb távon is jó szórakozás, ami leköt, vagy inkább csak az egyediségével frissnek hat.

RATING: 7
A very cool light-medium Euro in which players manage a hand of cards to pay for placements in various areas on a shared board. There are several area control contests happening simultaneously, blurring obvious strategies. Furthermore, actions are extremely constrained thanks to a worker placement phase in which players get to choose, with one placement, the two actions that they will execute that round. The game flows nicely from round to round and even if you're not winning you're likely to feel like you're accomplishing things. Well-done and not nearly as aggressive as most games of its ilk.

It is always a problem developing a game and then rating it. But I really like it, what can I say? The ratio rules/game complexity is really good. The more you play it, you discover more and more possibilities to change your strategy.

Received in a math trade (1/5/16).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]I still really like Mangrovia for the quick playtime (45 - 60 minutes), ease of explanation, graet blend of mechanisms (area control, set collection and action selection rondel). Unfortunately I've run into one major game play problem, the amulet track is broken. 

Amulets are used to buy certain spaces on the board, similar to the goods cards, however any unused amulets are also worth points at the end of the game. Added to this is the amulet track can advance on which allows you to draw and keep more and more amulets. Since some spaces can only be brought with amulets you can't counter an amulet strategy based on the area control aspect of the game. The only way to play against this strategy is to make sure you also compete for the limited spaces that allow you to advance on the amulet track. You are left having to "defend" against a dominant strategy by taking part in it yourself kills the game for me because the viable paths to victory are quite limited. 

I've tried to score points in various other ways and gotten blown out by those players that choose the amulet strategy. I wish the designer would speak to this and if they agree that it is OP offer a variant to fix it. I've played the game 10 times at every player count so I feel pretty confident in my observation although I know folks will disagree. So unfortunately a game I really enjoy playing (minus the amulet strategy) will be leaving our collection.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great next level Euro that some how pulls off combining worker placement, hand management and area control in an intuitive rule set.
- I love the theme and art in this game, it is refreshingly bright and cheery.
- There are three different areas you are building in to score points in different ways which opens up a lot of different strategies when building your huts. Not to mention some spaces offer points as soon as you build them as well.
- Excellent 5p game in under 90 minutes, that said I can't wait to play with two and see how it goes. 

Mangrovia has been on and off my wishlist a lot, but when I finally had the chance I got a copy. I got to play it twice in the same day at a local con with four and five players and the game was easy to teach/learn. The economy in the game reminds me of Alhambra in so far as you need to pay with an exact amount, but it has the additional requirement of playing a card of the matching terrain you want to build on. This is a very elegant design, you will internalize the rules once you start playing right away. When reading the rule book things can seem a bit obtuse, but this is a great game to teach as you play. 

I don't introduce many games to my wife nowadays, but this is such a smooth game that it's next on the docket. I would highly recommend checking this game out if you enjoy Euro's that are easy to play, but offer a lot of difficult decisions through out; I'd compare Mangrovia to games like Vikings, Palaces of Carrara and Royals.[/i]

Because of the archipelago/roundel mechanic, we have experienced that even in the very first round, some one else can "steal" your favourite spot. If you choose to take cards early, you will of course collect the best cards. However, you are the last one to choose building spot, so that's a risk. Therefore, the tension is really high all the way to the end. The birds of paradise strengthen this feeling. The action spots are also very well balanced. Plenty of fantastic dilemmas. In addition, you have to try to avoid other players doing one strategy alone, which force you to keep attention to what other players are doing. This is a game I can almost play with any one, but with the depth that gamers will love, as well. Hats off for the graphics and components!

Mangrovia has all the elements of a game that is good for gaming groups...it is easy to explain, it doesn't take long to play, it uses a couple of unique mechanisms, it offers various strategies for accumulating points, it is competitive, and it is attractive and just generally enjoyable.  On the negative side, you can experience some frustration from not having the right combination of cards and/or amulets at the right time, although this is part of the decision-making about which action you want to take.  For example, in my most recent game, I drew the most valuable amulet (a 6) early in the game, but the situation on the board was already such that I could never use it.  However, in most cases, the frustration comes from having another player build on the spot you were hoping to build on, and this is not so much a negative as a element of good competition!

Not totally convinced after 1 play. The luck in drawing cards seems a bit too high, especially in landscape-type.

RATING: 8
This is a wonderful, quick playing thinky euro, where you have that most wonderful combination of simple choices with complicated ramifications. Essentially what you are doing is either gathering cards in one or more of the three game currencies, or building huts. Huts do all sorts of wonderful area control at the end of the game depending on where you place them. One area gives you extra draws from a sack of spendable points, one area will calculate who has the most, another will calculate total huts in that area, and then it's combined with a Urban Sprawl style 'majority in the row and column'. To make things even more exciting, there is a single action spot available each round that lets you build 2 huts into a single spot, meaning even if a player thinks they are sitting pretty, someone can still upset the balance.

Na, végre valami 2014-es játék, amiben látok lehetőséget. Házikókat rakunk le, amivel rögtön pontot szerzünk vagy a játék végén egy asszimetrikus pályára. Egy ház lerakásához az adott 4 területforma közül az egyik kártyájához és adott számú pontkártyára van szükség. Minden játékosnak két akciója van körönként. Az egyik lapszerzés vagy amulettszerzés, a másik építés. Vannak értékesebb helyek, amiket csak amulettel lehet beépíteni. A játék nem vészesen hosszú, gyönyörű, egyediség is van benne és valószínűleg bármilyen játékosszámmal működik. Kimondottan tetszett, akár még fentebb is mehet a pont.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a bit convoluted for a Zoch game, and was surprisingly heavier than I expected. 

The theme is absurdly pasted on. The game is basically a grid with a variety of conditions that you have to fill in order to place 1 or 2 pieces in a box. There are a few different scoring methods based on where you place, and some amulets. As a player it feels like shooting skeet waiting for the opportunity to fire, there are so many things that have to line up before you can pull the trigger. For such an abstract game it shouldn't be particularly intriguing, but the action system is very clever. 

Because of how actions are selected you are faced with some hard choices, and between which actions you are granted, tough hand management, and building permission I found myself deeply wrapped up in the game.

1 play, 4er

This is a moderately light area majority game with a clever action / turn order selection system sort of like what you see in Last Will: earlier in turn order is paired with (maybe) weaker actions. The board is roughly a grid, with some missing areas and some special sections, plus a few spots outside the grid. Each round, players select the actions they want for the round, which also sets turn order for next turn. They use actions to draw cards (from one of 2 face up displays or decks) and/or play huts onto the board spaces. The leftmost columns and topmost rows are the areas of interest for end-game majorities VP awards, but you can also earn VP along the way from other sections of the board and from specific spaces on the board. 

First player each turn passes to the right, unless someone decides to take the start player action. In this game, Mary (to my right) took First Player every time it was _just_ about to go to me -- soooo annoying! Despite that, I tend to like area majorities and this was a pretty fun game (even though I ended up in 3rd place, 1 VP in front of Mary and several behind Rick and winner Toni).

I wouldn't mind playing this again, but it wasn't really interesting enough to seek out.

tl;dr: solid family strategy game

At it's heart this is a resource collection game with an important area majority element. Nothing new there, but this game tries to stand out by offering it's own new twist. It comes in the form of a nice, novel action selection mechanism that's a mishmash of a number of things we've seen before, put together in a new way. And it works great. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something similar again in other games.
All in all I would say this mechanism makes the game interesting enough to make it worth playing, but the area majority element of the game is pretty standard and there was some room there to be a bit more original, so I feel the author missed a chance there.

I really liked the action selection of Mangrovia, even if many of the actins themselves were fairly generic. The timing of building and collecting cards nicely offsets and despite some of the chaos it is entirely possible to plan well and execute something across multiple turns.

Alas, the back-end of the game is a lot more generic with three different types of area control though even this is mixed up with immediate points, access to more choice in drawing amulets etc.

It's very nicely put together (of course it is! It's a Zoch game!) but I wonder how many times I'll really want to pull it down from the shelf...

I can't fault this game it provided a solid enjoyable strategic and tactical experience in a good time frame with 5 players. The game does sometimes slow as some players take time to think about their turn but this doesn't detract too much and the downtime is not really an issue, but I like this game as a step up from Gateway's. The board looks great and is very colourful and the hut and bowl pieces are well made and give a nice tactile feel to the game. The theme isn't particularly strong but the graphic design is well done and everything fits in nicely.  The insert is well designed too which shows the thought that went into this as a package. Overall a solid addition to my collection.

This was another of Maciek's games I had never heard of before. It looks like a kid's game, but quickly reveals itself to be way more gamery than that. It's essentially an area majority contest with some extra scoring possibilities added on.

The thing that really makes this game is the action selection mechanism where the action you choose for your first action determines your second, or vice versa I suppose. This leads to some really interesting choices.

You're drafting number and terrain cards which you then use to build huts in the area majority contest. Cards closer to the score markers break ties. There's a potential to lose a turn if you can't end up building when you're supposed to, which is painful.

The game is fairly abstract and it has the typical majority control dance. That and the action selection mechanism made this one very fun for me. I'd really love to see this mechanism used again in a deeper game.

Zoch games always have good production values. Mangrovia is no exception. The palette is vibrant and the components from cards to wooden bits are top notch. Game play however, leaves a bit to be desired. This is a standard Euro affair with multiple paths to scoring victory points. There is some set collection, variable phase action selection and worker placement all roll into one. First, there is a pretty unique action selection mechanism that is based on a snake draft. Players who picked the most powerful action will also paired with the least powerful action and so forth. This includes turn order. If you pick to go first, then you also have to go last. It is surprising that I cannot think of another game that utilizes this particular action selection mechanism for turn order or variable player powers. That is indeed a neat mechanic.

Now for the frustrating part of the game: a large part of the game is based on denial of choice, which itself is quite common in worker placement games. The issue I note is that many layers of decision making have to go your way in order to place a hut exactly where you want it to be. At any point in time if there is deviation in the path, you have to find another option and more often than not, late in the game, there isn't really a second best option. I find that frustrating.  I count at least 4-5 stages where your plans could be thwarted. First, you must select the action you want, such as hut placement. Granted, many actions allow hut placements. Next, you must have the right terrain and numerical values to place a hut. Cards are selected from a tableau, but the tableau is not replenished until end of the round. So, the cards you want likely won't be around if you go late in turn order. Third, to place a hut, even with the right cards, the terrain must be activated. Only two types of terrain are active each round. finally, you hope that no one places the hut on a particular square before you do. If at any step, things go wrong, it is tough to find a compensatory action as the multiple parameters make hut placement restrictive. Again, I find it frustrating that after all the careful planning and only to get scooped at the end, I still couldn't find a satisfactory consolation placement option. Therein lies the frustration in playing Mangrovia. I also suspect that some of the paths such as collecting amulets drawn at random from the bag is a slightly more powerful approach. 

Still, Mangrovia isn't a terrible game. It's just that in a crowded field of games, I likely won't have a chance to get back to it anytime soon.

A "solid 7" with good production values. The board colors really pop out. A combination tile laying, area control, and set collection.

Looks lovely, nice bright colours and plays really well. Simple and slick, intuiative and while quite light yet enough to think about.

Really like the action choosing mechanic, weighing up how much you want to be sure of doing what you need vs what you need to do to make sure you can do it!

Another of the completely solid but unremarkable games from Essen 2014.  Action selection and majority scoring.

So-so game... it flows well, it's nice to behold, it's not too complicated but... it's old style, it has nothing new, it's a point salad where the theme doesn't help grasp the meaning of your actions. It's a very geometrical majority with a wild theme that does nothing to help (remember that i adore Knizia games, so usually the lack of a proper theme is not a problem on principle...).
Maybe another play would help me raising the rating but i dont feel like playing this again: it doesn't give me any positive feeling whatsoever

This one hit my radar when Rahdo called it a "Ticket to Ride killer". I don't really see that happening any time soon, but it's still a very fun light to medium Euro with a pleasant theme that's one step up from TtR in terms of complexity. Don't think I will turn down a game of this any time soon. This game was made for 4 or 5 players though. With 2 or 3 it's a little 'meh'.

Family strategy game of hut building with area control over key areas in the mangrove game board. Worker action draft determines player order to get landscape and/or resource cards, claim amulets, and build huts. The Gods use Birds of Paradise to limit which landscapes can have a hut each round. Three mini areas on the board have separate area control objectives. The main being a row and column grid of ritual stones positioning as close as possible to the stones.

Hezky barevná hra s poměrně kvalitními komponenty. Bodování centrální oblasti s násobkem chýší se mi však zdá příliš silné a tak mám strach, že se hra zvrtne v souboj pouze o tuto oblast.

Ez érdekes volt, kicsit talán többet vártam tőle. A tábla nincs összhangban a doboz grafikájával, a belső talán túl "egyszerű", ezért a minimális csalódás. Ettől függetlenül a játék tetszett, de nem az a hatalmas klasszikus. Ráadásul úgy tűnik, az amulettgyűjtéssel hatalmas előnyre lehet szert tenni, ezt egy kicsit jobban kiegyenlíthették volna.

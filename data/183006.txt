Very interesting little dice game. It reminds me of Rolling Japan as it takes some planning and spacial awareness, but I like it better. After one play I feel the need to play again and again. I even want to play right now. The tiny box is a plus. Sehr gut, NSV!

Qwinto is an almost perfect quick dice game. You are 100% involved in the game even when it's not your own turn. There is plenty of room for tactical decisions on how far you want to push your luck. The game has a dramatic arc as it progresses, and it plays quick.

The obvious comparison is Qwixx. both are very similar but I might prefer Qwinto for the diverse ways to score points.

A light dice rolling filler, Qwinto’s appeal comes from its simplicity: with just three dice you get a moderate challenge that includes gambling, guessing, probability calculus and sheer luck, which means a little of everything to appease everyone’s tastes.

Neat dice game.  Offers some interesting choices on where to put the numbers rolled, and also which of the three colored dice to roll.  More fun than Qwixx i think.

RATING: 6
One play. It's a fine filler. I've played a lot better, including Qwixx.

I find with Qwinto the early decisions are not as interesting as with Qwixx. In Qwixx there can be tough decisions every turn, but in Qwinto the first 2/3 of the game we just sailed through, easy decisions all. Then at the end we started to get some restrictions, and it had the potential to be interesting, but it was over soon after. Maybe we had an outlier game. Need to play it again.

As it stands right now, it's not as good as Qwixx, but it may be a good choice for Qwixx fans wanting some variety. But there are also quite a few Qwixx expansions/variants (gemixxt, Big Points) which are better for that purpose.

It's hard for me to rate any of these little dice rolling fillers much better or worse than a 5 any more, as there are a ton of them, and they all feel like such a similar experience.

This one is fun for a quick little filler, and introduces a few hard decisions in a tight package. It's just that all of this type of game are so interchangeable that they end up being a take it or leave it type game for me. A fine game among many fine games in the genre.

2-6

In Qwinto, each player receives a player sheet and a pencil. The starting player is randomly selected and he receives 3 dice of 3 colors - purple, yellow, and orange. He selects how many and which dice to roll, rolls them, and may re-roll them up to one time if he is unhappy with the result. He then must call out the total number of pips on all the rolled dice. He MUST write this number in a row of his player sheet of the same color as one of the rolled dice. The other players MAY do so if they wish. If the active player is unable to enter the number on his player sheet, he must write an X in the 4-box "failed attempt row" below the colored rows. 

When entering numbers, players must follow these rules:
1) Numbers in each row must go in ascending order from left to right
2) Each column must contain different numbers

The game ends either when a player has completed two colored rows or when a player has recorded their fourth x in the failed attempt row. 

To score, players first record points scored in each of the three colored rows. If a colored row contains any empty fields, each entered number in the row is scored as 1 point. If a row is completely filled, the number in the rightmost field of that row is the number of points scored for that row. Second, players record for the five vertical columns. If there are any empty fields in a column, no bonus is awarded. If all three fields in the column are filled with numbers, the number in the pentagonal bonus field is awarded as a bonus. X's entered as failed attempts are each worth -5 points.

I think this game is better than its sister, Qwixx, which too often features similar play among players, with the luckiest one winning. Qwinto has more options, not least the choice of dice to throw, so players are less likely to go down parallel paths.

RATING: 5
The three communal dice make this little game interesting in several ways. First, only one player chooses which dice to roll, and whether or not to re-roll them, however the result of the roll affects everyone. This add a small layer of deduction as players try to anticipate which players will roll which dice, and try to build their board out accordingly. Granted, its still incredibly light and there really isn't much else to chew on, but you could do much worse for a fifteen minute filler.

In the same "series" as Qwixx. Here, you can write a number any where, as long as you stick to the rules of ascending rows and none of the same numbers in columns. It's a bit more thinky than Qwixx, and the luck factor is reduced quite a bit compared to Qwixx, Great game!

Not quite up to the level of Qwixx, I think. Even though it seems like the game requires more difficult decisions (not difficult, mind you, just a little harder than Qwixx) of its players, I believe the final result is much more dependent on lucky rolls than its predecessor. Nevertheless, not a bad diversion at all.

This is my go-to roll-&-write game.  It's very portable (slightly larger than a smart phone), easy to teach, quick to play, nice choices to make all the way through.  I love that you have to stay engaged for every roll of every player in case you want to leech one of the opponent's numbers for yourself.

My only complaint is that it's only available in German while I'm from the USA and I do not read German.  I downloaded/read English rules from the web.

The perfect dice game?  Maybe not but I don't know that I've found a better dice throwing game with such wide appeal.

A nice balance of luck and strategy that is quick and can scale up to 5-6 players.

Qwinto is Qwixx 2.0, a re-development rather than a progression. As fun or unfun as the original, depending on taste. It's a bit less intuitive, potentially a bit more challenging. An okay game I happily join in but can't muster a lot of enthusiasm for.

This one fires Qwixx as the decisions are far more interesting. I pushed my luck too far each time and failed miserably in all of my games. The decision point of how many and which die(dice) to roll in an attempt to place the number is quite interesting.

Better than Qwixx as there is more to think about, yet it is just as streamlined. Which dice should I roll, should I re-roll, which space should I mark off?

[b]Qwinto[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 10)[/COLOR]

[i]I have played a lot of roll and write games* and Qwinto has emerged as my absolute favorite. Personally I think it offers the best combination of depth and push your luck mechanisms as you try and maximize each number placement. Qwinto also manages to place the perfect amount of constraint on what you can do while still offering multiple ways to score points. The toughest rule to follow by far is not duplicating a number in the same column, you will invariably be cursing this rule at some point during a game. Qwinto has grown on me the more I've played it; I started to realize there was more strategy than was first apparent, especially compared to other roll and write games. Many of these games focus on the push your luck aspect of game play, Qwinto manages to create a very thinky puzzle to solve and offer opportunities to try your luck. 

Needless to say I'd highly recommend Qwinto, even if you're not usually a fan of these types of games. 

[i]*Currently owned in order of preference: Qwinto, Qwixx: Das Duell [i](my favorite 2p)[/i], Balloon Pop [i](my favorite pure push your luck)[/i] Rolling America, Noch Mal, Qwixx, Zooloretto: The Dice Game and Dice Stars. 

No longer in our collection: La Granja: No Siesta, Saint Malo and Twenty One. I'd include Castro and Spexxx in this category because even though they inlude boards they share a lot of similarities to roll and write games.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great dice filler, think Qwixx with a bit more depth.
- Perfect game to have in your car and play anywhere.
- Can be taught to anyone in a matter of minutes.
- Unlike many dice fillers [i](Qwixx included)[/i] you choose which dice to throw each turn which opens up the strategy when taking onto account what will help you and not necessarily your opponents. 
- You may want to swap out the dice with some of your own, the quality of the dice is abysmal.

I held off on getting this for a while because there were quite a few people who thought it was better with more players, then I saw a review by [i][user=milenaguberinic]Mina[/user][/i] on the [i][thread=1575358]2p experience[/thread][/i] and I decided to get a copy. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed, I am a huge fan of Qwixx and Qwinto seems to be a somewhat heavier follow up to Qwixx [i](both are light fillers though)[/i]. You are not only trying to score rows, but also specific spots in certain columns. You would think that everyone would place the die values in the same place, but that hasn't been the case in our games. we've all been aggressive with trying to score a lot of points in those specific spaces (which are pentagon shaped to distinguish them). Similar to Qwixx you can also use the die values rolled on everyone's turn(s) so there is never any downtime. Along with Qwixx, Qwinto is another must have dice filler in my opinion. 


I hope that Gamewright decides to print Qwinto in the same format as Rolling America and Qwixx.[/i]

Now this is a fun filler. The rules are as simple as can be and there may be very little thought that needs to go into your decision, but it is still a lot of fun. You chose 1, 2 or 3 dice and roll them, the total then must be placed on your score card, but you must keep them in increasing order. If you cannot fit a number that matches at least one color you get a fail if you were the one to roll the dice. The goal is simply to fill in as many spaces as possible to get the maximum score. Simple, fun and lots of laughs.

The successor to Qwixx and actually better than Qwixx.  Because players get to choose how many and which dice to roll on a turn, players influence the amount of risk involved.  It also adds a tactical layer in that you can avoid rolling the die your opponent may need to end to finish a row or column.  It can also be agonizing deciding which box to place a number.  It is still a light game, but definitely has more room for decisions than Qwixx.  I need to play it more, but this may very well be the best "restaurant" filler there is.

I got to play this little filler on Jan 2017 at my local meetup group.

I enjoy this filler very much. You roll and each player is engaged and filling out their own sheet. Don't get trapped though because you lose points if you can't fill in stuff anymore!

Qwinto feels like Qwixx with more freedom (and therefore more difficult decisions). One of the better roll & writes I've played.

So much better than Qwixx!

The huge difference between this and Qwixx is that there is far less arithmetic. (Considering how light both these games are, arithmetic must be minimized as much as possible.)

2-6 players.  I love this game.  It's a quick, light weight, addictive filler game that has no down time because players can take advantage of the opponents' dice rolls for their own scoring.

This may have toppled Qwixx as my go-to dice filler.  Pretty strategic, you get 3 decision points: which dice to roll, whether to reroll, and where to mark.

An interesting card game that employs offensive and defensive strategies when stacking cards each turn. At first blush it looks very simple and straightforward, but I can see deeper strategies emerge the more I play it. With only a few plays in so far I'm fairly certain it will remain in my collection since it's mechanics are unlike any other card game that I have played so far. My rating may change with more plays...but I imagine it will only go higher.

From the Guru

Qwixx is good
Qwixx the card game is better
Qwinto is the best of the lot

Very easy rules, takes a minute to explain, but so much more to think about regarding placement of numbers and of which colour.

Quick, easy, a lot more strategic than Qwixx is. However, non-gamers tend to find this a bit too difficult, because you have to keep track of so much stuff.

A fun game in the style of Qwixx, where someone throws dice and everyone has the option to use the number. Here, the score sheets show 3 partially overlapping colored rows of shapes (mostly circle, some pentagons). On your turn, roll 1-3 d6 (in colors of rows). Everyone may write the sum into an empty space matching the color of one of the dice used as long as:
- values in each row increase L-->R
- columns have distinct numbers
If YOU, the active player, don't write a number down you must put a check in a  misthrow box (-5VP at end). The game ends until any player has either filled 2 rows completely, or checked 4 misthrows. 

Scoring:
- Each row: if completely filled, score as many VP as highest number; if not, 1 VP per filled space
- Each column: if completely filled, score the number in the pentagon.
- Lose 5VP per misthrow.
Highest sum wins!

Nice filler! Requires more thought than expected upon getting the rules explained, and a very nice tension arc rising towards the end of the game. In the end, it is a simple calculation to determine who wins. Recommended for families that like dice games with just a bit more oompfh as Yathzee or Pickomino.

As it is easily explained and plays fast, this is also a great filler waiting for the rest of the party to arrive for the main fare of your game night. Needs 3+ players to shine though.

tl;dr: more of the same but different - in a good way

Everyone looking at this game will see the obvious connections to Qwixx. But don't let this fool you: this is a nifty twist on the concept that makes it more interesting as you have more and more difficult decisions to make as to when to fill in what as you can choose what values go where but they all have to go in ascending order. Nice!

This has a bit more to consider than Qwixx, but it seems more likely for busts to end the game. Normally I would like the game with deeper decisions, but I think I like the straightforward nature of Qwixx better.

Each player has a score sheet with three lines of boxes. Players assign numbers to the boxes from the total of 1 to 3d6, phasing player's choice of how many dice and which color(s). Each line and die has its own color. You must keep each line strictly ascending (1 2 4 8, okay; 1 3 3 8, not legal).

Each 1-3d6 total must be assigned to a box on the line of one of the colors chosen; non-phasing players can pass on a number without penalty, but the phasing player gets -5 points if he doesn't use his own roll.

Columns also cannot have duplicate numbers, so you can put yourself in a situation like 6 _ 8 but with 7 in the same column on a different line, making the situation impossible. Certainly this would become easier with practice, but I wonder if it makes the game less fun in a filler to be only occasionally played.

Really good filler, [i]much[/i] better than Qwixx. In fact, this is basically Qwixx 2.0.

It's the same basic game, but there are more ways to score in Qwinto so there are some real decisions now. In Qwixx the best move was usually obvious and the game almost played itself.

Really good initial impressions, this one seems like a keeper.

Qwixx's older brother? Younger brother? Nephew? Cousin? Either way, it's derivative. It's not bad, but it's not quite as quick-playing as Qwixx, since it requires a bit more thought as to how to play your numbers.

Würfelspiel, Absacker

Greift den Mechanismus von Qwixx auf und wandelt ihn gekonnt ab. Ist kein Klon von Qwixx sondern spielt sich ganz anders. Schafft es wieder alle Spieler bei jedem Wurf mit einzubeziehen. Ist etwas knobeliger als Qwixx aber immer noch sehr leichtgängig und schnell gespielt.

Eine echte Empfehlung.

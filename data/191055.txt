Kerala is an excellent tile laying game that would be best suited to families and players who tend to like their games on the lighter side of the spectrum. 

While the luck of the draw might frustrate players who enjoy long term planning, Kerala offers a fun exercise for people who enjoy more tactical play. There are decisions to be made, but none of them are too stressful. 

My wife and I enjoyed this a lot, and it will be a great thing to bring out to play with our friends who are casual gamers.

A gorgeous and colourful yet simple game. I really enjoy playing this with my partner, who is mad about elephants.

Works really well with 2 players or more. 

Highly recommended

Light light tile laying.  Box too big and price too high for what you get, but it was fun

RATING: 6
It's a themeless abstract but there are some interesting decisions in here.  I'm not sure I'd like it with more than two players - the drafting mechanism would be very frustrating if you're picking fifth.  Also, I think you'd need a pretty good sized table to play with five.  Rating boosted a bit by the pretty elephants and colorful tiles, it's a good looking game.

Has some similarities to tile laying games like Kingdomino but the drafting is always done clockwise from the start player, which rotates each turn. Very pleasing to look at.

RATING: 8
Preliminary rating after one game: Very good, light familiy game which is actually a city builder (forget the stupid "elephant festival" theme). Each player builds his own city which consists of tiles of different colors. Main goal is to get all 5 colors while keeping the tiles of each color connected to each other. The elephants are actually the builders which determine where you can put your next tile. Easy, clear rules, simple scoring yet enough interesting decisions to appeal both to geeks and casual gamers. Recommended as a gateway game to play with your non-gamer friends or family members.

In Kerala, you start with two chunky elephants crowding onto a single tile of a matching color. Every turn, tiles are drawn from a bag equal to the number of players and in turn players draft a tile and add it to their tableau. Tiles can only be placed adjacent to an elephant and then the elephant moves onto the tile. So your tableau is basically built depending on the course your elephants take. Some tile, rather than scoring you points at the end of the game, allow you to move an elephant or a tile in order to course-correct as you build. Scoring tiles are worth 1-3 points depending on how many elephants are printed on it. You can also place tiles on other tiles if you wish to convert a previously placed non-scoring tile into points. The tricky part is that you can only score one area for each color. Every tile of a color not in the score area are worth -2 at the end, so it is critical to build your tableau in a way that minimizes the number of areas of each color. 

The drafting gives very limited choices and your placements are highly limited by the locations of your elephants. That's a lot of limits and players who accuse the game of playing itself will have a point. The game would not work if it were not for the tiles that allow you to make adjustments to what's already been placed. The box is big compared to what the game brings to the table and this would be my only hesitation in picking it up. However, it comes with a bag for all of the tiles and if the elephants can fit in there as well I'd probably ditch the box and make it a bag game. In short, it's merely a pleasant game, but it's the kind of game I like.

The positioning of your elephants the way that gives you the most flexibility in the tile draft is interesting and leads to a decent game. A bit prone to analysis paralysis, but generally this flows smoothly.

Good looking abstract with nice sturdy tiles & big wooden game pieces. Easy to learn and quite fun to play although I was hoping a bit more interesting and harder experience. Now Kerala is just a bit too soulless for my taste which why it wasn't a keeper for me.

This killed Carcassonne for me and my wife.  Plays well at all player counts, and the spatial aspect makes for a fun puzzle.  There is no player interaction beyond the draft, but that one little part allows for so much interaction.  Hate drafting is only a valid strategy when it doesn't completely screw you over.

Pretty on the table, and a thinky enough filler, this one will be staying in the collection for quite some time.

The problem i have with the game is the way it Deals out the tiles for placement. Not only are the tile attributes boring and uninspiring but the mechanism of distribution makes this more a luck game then an actual challenge.

Pretty tile-laying game. The main idea of the game is fairly basic, but the elephants restrict the tile-laying in a quite strict way, and the scoring mechanism can punish mistakes heavily.

Suggest.

RATING: 6.5
Simple enough abstract game that is a mixed bag, as far as tension goes. A few turns felt like difficult decisions when odd colored tiles were all that were available, but mostly the placement was easy and straightforward-feeling while the players quietly built up points. No one even had to discard a single tile during scoring.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun and highly interactive abstract in which players draft tiles in order to add to an individual area, with hopes of creating contiguous areas of the same color. The scoring is straightforward, yet the game offers plenty of decisions along the way. Ultimately, there's some luck in the tile draw that you have to plan for, but in a 30 minute game that's perfectly acceptable. Most tight spots you find yourself in are the result of your own choices. Very pretty bits.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Kerala is a quick, abstract, tile laying game with some amazing elephant meeples. This is a great family weight abstract and while I'm not the biggest fan of abstract games I really like tile laying games. 

In Kerala turns are quick; you draft a tile , place your tile and if it happens to have one of two special abilities you then carry out that action. What makes Kerala demanding is that each turn you have to place your tile on an orthogonally adjacent space to one of your elephants. Since you can only score one section of each color things quickly get difficult. 

I played with both 2 and 3 players and enjoyed the 3p experience more. In the 2p game there are only two tiles to choose from, so it is really easy to get hosed by the tile draw. This definitely creates some extra tension, but can also feel random. I'd like to try the 2p game using the 3p set up. Basically each round you would pull three tiles from the bag and after both players select a tile the extra one would get tossed. You'd also be placing 30 tiles instead of 40. Regardless of player count concerns I think Kerala would be a huge hit in my house, especially with my girls and wife. I'll probably end up picking up a copy in the near future.[/i]

PRETTY game the elephants are gorgeous and the box is equally so. Very simple drafting tile laying game. You have to make continuous groupings of the colors all while moving your elephants. Very light but a lot of fun. Would be better in a smaller box. High price point for what it offers but still I enjoyed the game enough where I might consider buying Riley's copy...

This was a complete surprise hit for me. I thoroughly enjoyed this little tile laying game. Drafting for tiles works great and placement based on where your elephants are makes for some tough decisions. The wooden elephant pieces with screen printing were gorgeous! I would gladly play this game anytime.

Manages to pack a nice thinky game into a small amount of rules. In the beginning it's not too hard to take tiles and it almost seems like too easy of a game, but then as you get about halfway through, making sure you don't lose points gets a lot tougher, and positioning your elephants so you can still maximize using the tiles that randomly come out gets harder and harder without creating extra groups you don't want. Components are beautiful, and the game could be taught to just about anyone. Excellent game, I plan to keep this one a long time.

RATING: 8.5
Very entertaining, quick playing abstract game of optimal tile placement. The subject matter could have been anything, but I really like the Indian pachyderm theme they chose and especially the exceptional art, wooden painted components and high quality tiles. I would've preferred a plush velvet cloth tile bag because you use it so often, but that can be replaced. 

Pretty unique in terms of abstract games I've played and AP is not too bad. This game has some real depth of strategy too trying to place your elephants and tiles while disrupting your opponents tableau. Basically through tile drafting you're trying to collect all five colors in single herds (you can have two groups in your own color) while maximizing the number of elephants in each (bc those are VPs) and minimizing herd patchiness and passing on your turn as those confer penalties. It has elements of Backgammon (limited, but requisite movement), Santorini (tile stacking) and Cacao (puzzle placement), but really is unlike most others in this genre. I like that there are reorganization tiles that let you move a prior placement and ones that let you reset one of your elephant meeples to a more advantageous positioning for future turns. 

Certainly it is less adversarial than Chess or Battle Sheep, but you can influence your opponents map every other turn through cunning tile selection so it's not merely simultaneous solitaire. I think it'll make it to the table often for us. You can pick this up for around $20... well worth the investment for a fun, beautiful game with high replayability.

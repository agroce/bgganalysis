beautiful and precise map, beautiful components.
Very commendable effort, but it is difficult to enjoy the game because the rules are too confusing.
We would recommend a full rewrite: no matter how long, no matter how many repetitions: as long as it's clear and complete

I expect to be able to give this a higher rating once the rules are updated in key areas e.g. supply.   At the moment too much time is lost seeking missing or ambiguous rules clarifications on BGG etc.

The playbook intro Husky scenario takes the new player straight in to erroneous examples and rules bugs.

As this continues to get table-time, I continue to adore it - really a great game, and I can't imagine anything better on the Italian Front. Really hits a sweet spot for me, not as chess-like as Russia but still quite spare.

For the optional rules, definitely use the Attrition rules and don't be shy about using them on non-offensive turns if you don't have a combat card combo in your hand. It'll save a lot of time and wristage, and they do a good job when you hit the dense terrain of central Italy or have bad weather and don't have enough force available to achieve much. I've had mixed results with some of the other ones; the supply rules *seem* like they should be a welcome addition but the once I used them they felt a little rough, so not sure. I need to give them another try.
---
I like all the games in the No Retreat series a lot, but I was still surprised by just how much I liked the Italian Front version. The topic isn't necessarily super-promising; Italy was a huge, bloody slog over really dominating defensive positions, without a ton of maneuver or subtlety. Plus NR4 is the rulesiest of the No Retreat games, which are already just a touch rulesier that one would ideally like. But I still really like it, it's maybe even my favorite in the series. It really captures all the interesting stuff about the campaign, and gets the flavor just right without getting bogged down. The rules reflect that there was a lot of stuff going on with amphibious invasions, specialized troops, terrain, and whatnot. The telescoping mechanics from No Retreat North Africa are great. The counter density is perfect, enough units that misplacing just one probably won't kill you like it can in Russia or North Africa, but not so many that the choice of how to move each one isn't crucial. The attrition combat mechanic is great, and I also think the leaders are a nice touch.

The campaign game is, to me, by far the most appealing of the No Retreat campaigns. But, it is a bit of a monster - 8-12 hours maybe once you're familiar with the game (which does take a bit). Not bad by the scale of these things, but still quite a time commitment. As with all these games the real value is in the scenarios; most of them are great and tense and super-playable. Unlike so many wargames, the No Retreat games really reward and encourage repeated play and study. There is a lot of depth and subtlety to the games and a lot to enjoy.

Anyway, I give all the No Retreat games my top recommendation, which is saying something, Italy is definitely meatier and more involved that the others, but still one of my top picks.

A lot of people complaining that the rules are too complicated. That's fine, if the game is actually too complex for your taste. But my experience is that the game has a lot of chrome but it doesn't get in the way as you can also look things up easily. Rules are graphics rich and well organized with an extensive index that may escape some. 

By far the biggest issue is how to learn the game. My recommendation is to peruse the sequence of play, then go through the examples of play in the playbook before reading anything else. Run through the rules, then go back through the example. You'll have 90% of the system and the rest can be referenced as needed. And take a look at how little errata there has been since release, compare with NR1 and Carl has clearly learned how to catch the issues. 

It's like people see big counters and hexes and expect four pages of rules. Every game in this series is a radical departure from the norm and worth understanding to get to the gem each is. War games take commitment and effort to enjoy, I'm surprised so many war gamers see something outside of their experience and freak out. NR2 had the same issues and the end result is a game that makes every decision critical and creates fantastic tension.

The series comes to Italy and works but with the caveat of much greater complexity. The rules index is a blessing, and makes the task that much easier. I feel it is just too much, but it works as a simulation and the game is balanced. As with all No Retreat games it is tense. The Allies have a smaller margin of error and must be played with greater skill.

I simplified some concepts (especially the invasions and supply), yet this game is more complex than I usually care to make, but the peculiar Italian Front setting needed it to work "historically" correctly (I like mechanically simple designs).

This will most probably be the "biggest" wargame I'll ever do, and took far more effort than originally planned. Hey, there are so little games about this campaign, someone had to take the plunge sooner or later! :^)

One thing I would like to do down the road is to add half a dozen more event cards, perhaps as a GMT C3i magazine add-on?

It is a good game partially ruined by a poor rulebook.  While the full scenario example of play in the playbook is indeed entertaining it is not a substitute for proper examples (there are plenty of unclear points in the rules). Not 100% persuaded of the super-Germans approach too.

The good: good strategic framework, interesting offensive and supply mechanism. Effective implementation of attrition combat.

The Bad: more or less the poor rulebook (no real examples, and even errors in the playbook example of play!).

I love Mr. Paradis' No Retreat system. Low unit density, low-volume chrome, relatively fast player turns, and scenario support playable in an evening all contribute to making it a great. I like Italian Front significantly more than his rendition of North African Front, but less than Russian Front. I'm looking forward to seeing what his upcoming installments in the franchise are going to be like.

Great game. The gameplay is awesome but the immersion was constantly broken by long inconclusive rulebook reading sessions.

Gameplay deserves a higher rate, but rulebook really needs adjustments to fully enjoy it. In my first two games, a lot of times I just wanted to improvise the rules to be able to put away the rulebook and resume playing.

In the end I had to say that author is very active and helpful on the forum. I had to admit I exploited this by spamming him with various questions.

My FLGS had this in stock when I stopped by today, and I just couldn't resist. The No Retreat Russion front game is one of my favorites. I have barely touched the rules, but I will say the physical quality of the game is top notch, as nice as anything GMT has ever done. The map boards are beautiful, counters are gorgeous and super high quality, everything makes a sterling impression. 

I can hardly wait to get into the game, but if you are thinking about buying this, make sure you know what you are getting into. The rulebook is 39 pages - I'm hoping it's a relatively 'easy' 39 page rulebook, but we shall see. I'm fine with the complexity if it pays off with fresh look at this complex and fascinating campaign. (I loved AH's Anzio as a kid, and played it many, many times) Just be aware that this game may not be for newbie wargamers.

A fair bit more complicated than "No Retreat: The Russian Front," but all the moving parts make sense once you get a handle on them. Interestingly, even though the Italian and Russian fronts were radically different in many (most?) respects, the "No Retreat" system seems quite capable of accommodating the specific features of both. The downside (and upside, from a certain perspective) is that this has required the addition of a lot of chrome and special mechanics. Hence, "No Retreat: The Italian Front" trades ease-of-learning for a set of rules that account for the various unique features of the Italian campaign.  

The Germans, of course, are pretty much always on the defense. But it's hardly dull (and there are opportunities to spring some nasty surprises on the  Allies). The Allies, meanwhile, have the resources and the numbers on their side, but have to keep things moving if they want to get to the Alps by the end of the campaign. 

The games I've played so far have done a good job of capturing the feel of the grueling slog up the Italian peninsula while still remaining tense and interesting.

I was very excited about this game – I spent a lot of time with Anzio (AH) in my youth, and was hoping for a playable remake in the mould of No Retreat 1. So, I'm soloing the Sicily scenario and frankly struggling with the rules. Lots and lots of chromey exceptions, some of which really really should have been polished out by the developer. And unnecessarily disjointed rules, with important rule sections for some reason divided into bleeding chunks and scattered to opposite ends of the rulebook. Still, I'm not giving up, but it feels like a lot more work than it needed to be...

Outstanding game. High quality materials and very immersive narrative. It reproduces the Italian TW like no other game.  Everything is there: invasions, paratroopers, commando units, mountain units, difficulties in supplying troops, air raids...
The game has a huge number of rules, but you don't have to use all of them in order to play. I  started with few rules and slowly increased the amount of rules used per game. It made all the difference and I was able to enjoy the game right from the start. A piece of advice is: start with cards,basic movements and basic attacks. Forget about commanders, forts, ports, counterblows, shocktargets, shock counterblows and supply during your first plays.  Then gradually include the new rules on next games.  As you increase the amount of rules used, you'll be surprised on how good this game is! You just have to learn the rules and learning them slowly is the receipt for not being frustrated and get the best out of it. 
Of course, I believe that there should be some kind of "rules level", like "rules for beginners", "intermediate rules" and "advanced rules". Anyway, I did it myself and the result was superb.  One thing that I like a lot is that the designer (Carl Paradis) is always available on the forum for clarifications. 
This game is a masterpiece. If you like the subject, this is a "must have" game. I saw some negative evaluations provided by people who are not used to wargames. If you don't like wargames, please do yourself a favor and don't buy this game, because you'll get frustrated and will give this game a low rating, which definitively the game *doesn't* deserve. For example: I don't like Monopoly game (I actually hate it! It's too boring for me) and I respect people that like it, so I'll never give Monopoly any rating (good or bad). 
My opinion about this game: OUTSTANDING. I bought it because it contains the 1st Brazilian Infantry Division (aka FEB) and I got a pleasant surprise with game materials and with the way it reproduces the Italian front. If you like wargames, I highly recommend you to try this one.

It is everything suspiciously cumbersome about the No Retreat series, writ large. And yet there is good within it, I can feel it.

An example: Each side has one of four different leader cards in play, which give a variety of bonuses. One-time bonuses with specific scheduling are written on the card. Two "at large" bonuses are given in code. You have to look up the play aid or the rules to figure out the code. In Alexander's case one is "ST" -- Shock Target. It's a special target marker, so you refer to the special markers section in the back of the rules, which informs you it works just like a regular target marker except you get a "free" shock column shift -- but at the cost of potential losses, see rule 14.7.2. So now you have to read three different sections to find out what one bonus is ON A CARD. Remember when the virtue of including cards was that you could take the rules out of the rulebook?

[fx: head banging on desk]

I wish I could say this was an isolated bit, but the game is full of such nonsense. And yet, the basic mechanics are sound and the gameplay was tense. Unfortunately the game just does everything it can to keep you from playing it.

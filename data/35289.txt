Wow, that was a really good game!  It had very little downtime.  The chaining of actions was exciting.  Don't know why this flew under everyone's radar.  Good length too.  One fairly bad printing boo-boo on the board, but it's easily fixed.

Also an excellent family game, played with two daughters (10 and 13) without any issue. Fun and beautifully themed.
 Played also in two, and planning to play in five... With extra tokens and 25 points to win...

A lot of interesting mechanics blended into this - including dice rolling for income production and various options to exploit (art, colonization, etc.).  Great components and a beautiful board, but there is a significant absence of a victory point track (especially when you have to count up to 33 points).  Overall the game blends luck and strategy well, offering many interesting decisions and is a game that I can easily teach to people who may have only gone as far as Monopoly in terms of boardgaming.

It's OK, I guess. Blue and yellow seem to be the most important actions, though. Especially blue... and two players will get this action on the board while the other two players will need to fight over it in the guild area. Auctioning your unplayed actions will be important at times to get some income. Minor luck factor in rolling dice and moving about board for $1 or $2 in income, major luck factor in drawing from card decks, but this makes the game fun (if you're lucky).  It was OK with two players.... but nothing special.

Was initially attracted to the game for its theme (a bit of a heritage thing, I admit), and I stayed on for the beautiful board and card artwork. It's also a solid and fairly fun Euro...you've got plenty of options on where to move your markers, what card resources to draw, and there's even an auction mechanic and a little bit of randomness that add some depth to what might otherwise feel light.

This game shares several mechanics of other games. The most obvious are the resource fulfillment mechanics from Settlers. It also has all the luck of a card game. I do like the guild or market where you can buy extra actions and make future actions more expensive for everyone. I also like how influence gets played to the board. Scoring is a bit fiddly as you need to count up and announce your points after each turn, like Settlers, but there is more to count and it's more difficult to know where everyone is at. That said, I have fun playing this game, but the luck is a bit obnoxious.

Pros: 

1.Beautiful Artwork and components.
2.Light but nice & smooth gameplay. 
3.The markers auctions for getting money is a fun mechanic.

Cons: 

1. Maybe too much luck dependient in the card draw althought soon or later you're going to complete all set of cards.
2. Even with 4 players it seems to have less influential markers than is needed, at the second half of the game we often got out from the guild track to send that marker to the West Indies to get points because we didn't have more markers available. That felt strange to us.

Veredict: Funny game that maybe is a little hard for family and a little light for gamers: [b]Dangerous border[/b] . I suspect it will be hard to get to the table again.

Zalasta says (and many BGGers echo): A glorified Monopoly with a VP accruement engine tacked on. How well a person does is incredibly reliant on luck, not only initially on the dice roll, since that's your major source of income at the start, but later more on the card draw, so you can keep the influx of money going which allows you to take more actions on your turn. There's is literally no strategy to it, your choices are pretty straightforward. Make revenue and turn them into points. Your turn could take one or five minutes depending on how lucky you are. Simple and shallow for those looking for an Euro flavor to their average roll and move games.

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Octubre de 2016, por 5€.
Es un juego de "carreras". Gana el primero que consigue 33 puntos. En su turno, el jugador tiene una serie de acciones libres (que puede hacer siempre que pueda pagarlas)y acciones especiales (según las provincias donde tenga marcadores de influencia). Al final de cada turno, se calculan los puntos del jugador y si llega a 33 se declara ganador.
Es sencillo. Todavía no he podido terminar ninguna partida, pero parece entretenido.

Rather interesting economic game. There quite a lot of luck in the game but still skillful playing balances nicely the luck element. There's no simultaniuos actiivties on the board and thus the downtime between turn can be too long (atleast with four players).

EDIT:

Played a second game where one of the players lost the game basically in the game setup. Some of the actions are totally useless compared to others and the blue track is absolutely best.

There's also serious issues with being left behind: there's no chance of recovery when this happens unless you get extremely lucky with money.

Game also takes far too long and downtime is huge problem. I did not have fun at all and rating drops from 6 to 3. Not playing the game again.

WHY DO I LOVE THIS GAME?

Aside from the terrible box art, 1/2 Guilder pieces, and potentially glacial wait until more money flows into the economy, I love this game.

Auctioning off actions is a great thing to barter, even if it often ends with the richest player winning. 

So many little negatives, but still I have a great time.

I liked it quite a bit!  Time will tell how balanced the game is, but I enjoyed the perceived different paths to victory.  While I wouldn't really classify it as an economics game, money can be very tight, making progress pretty tough at times.  The game is a little about building a points engine, both money and points.  Overall, a pretty neat game from what I've seen so far.

This is a rather quick game with a wonky flow. At the start of the game you’re struggling to gain money, but once you get a couple of cards for income you suddenly take off. This means that, in the beginning, the luck of the dice roll (yes, this game features a “roll and move” mechanic, really!) can be quite substantial, but at least in our game it didn’t translate into a victory, which is great to see. Later in the game the luck comes from the card drawing, and this can be a substantial advantage – I won because I drew some great colonies that matched, and we found that the spice track is probably too strong (I got 4 markers for 21 points). You win by being first to get 33 points, and the end does come before you think; you can easily get 10+ points on a turn near the end. 

Because of the way the ways of taking action works, i.e. the fact that you can only take an action which you have a marker on the corresponding colored region, I think that you can fall behind and have a hard time catching up; if you don’t get some blue provinces so you can sail to the West/East Indies and score a lot of points, or if you don’t get access to brown regions which give you points for paintings (although at a slow rate), I cannot see how you’re going to win… Sure, this is mitigated by the guild track where you can take control each turn (if you have enough money), but I don’t think it’s going to be enough. 

So, the game ends sooner than you might think, and if you draw horrible (one of the players drew 5 ship cards, but not the required 3 different cards, ouch) the game can be over… But at least it’s not a long game, and while there is luck of the dice and cards, you can still make a strategy, and in my first game, 3 of the players had 27+ points, so it’s not totally imbalanced. I also liked the auction mechanic, which could sometimes pay off if you were in need of money and just needed a couple of bucks for a crucial action, while other times it was better to simply skip the action. I am definitely willing to try it again, but if the blue track is this strong again (as it gives a lot of points and leads to the orange cards, which are basically more powerful yellow income cards), I’m going to drop my rating significantly.

I am a huge Colovini fan, but this was truly uninteresting. The auction element was a sideshow, the leader is hard to catch without luck, the game is a Goa-Esque effort to move up a couple of different tracks, but the luck really drives a lot of your progress. I'm having a hard time seeing the charm here.

My love is capable of ignoring a stream of problems associated with a game as long as the artwork is evocative and beautiful. The moment this game entered her field of view she decided she must try it at some point. I was a bit more sceptical about it—all that glitters is of course not gold. But here was a title she really wanted to try, so when we had the opportunity, the two of us sat down and were explained the rules.

Yes, I am aware that the game is not conceived for two players, but we weren't intending on playing the game to completion: a brief introduction would do. It turned out a fairly straightforward and friendly investment game where various provinces of the then Netherlands give you money; this money must be turned into various items which give points on the long and short term. Nothing really fancy, nothing spectacularly bad too. Although... The income is determined by two dice, almost like in Monopoly by walking around a fixed track, and my sweetheart complained bitterly about this nonsensical mechanism. In her opinion, this game would make a marvellous relation gift, and in order for that to work, a more inventive and fun scheme than just throwing two dice would have to be invented. Silently, I agreed with her, so we broke off after about 5 rounds or so. It's a shame, really. So much effort has gone into making it a beautiful game to look at, and we discover yet again that this isn't always a sign for gaming quality.

What do you get when you you combine a crap-load of rules with a poorly labeled map? A surprisingly excellent game.

I'm not sure how it happened, but I really enjoyed this our play. Sure, the board needs a score track and sometimes things were clearly labeled and sometimes we were all confused, but with four players, this game was tense, exciting and best of all fun.

It combined area control with Catan-like dicing. And there are a lot of way to score points, so everyone can customize their strategy! Give it a try.

A prettier and meatier Catan without all the trading nonsense.  Luck drives a big part of the game but in a game of this length I don't mind it as much as in Catan where it is all encompassing.  Beautiful components.  The tulips seem like the best early means of income but the colonies and paintings are what will bring home the victory, IMHO.

There is a lot more luck in this game than your typical Euro, even though the mechanics feel very familiar.  Too lucky for my tastes.  I like the idea that you can either take your action or auction it off, but most of it feels like a rehash of many other Euro-games, just with a good dollup of extra luck.  This is the first new game that's making me wonder if I'm starting to get jaded.  Once all the provinces have been claimed, I think it may be too hard for someone with less provinces than his opponents to overtake them.

Nice game with a lot of player interaction. There is a little bit too much luck regarding dice roll at the beginning of the turn and drawing the best cards involved, otherwise I would rate the game even higher.

Wow, the auctions players put up for unused actions are more powerful than I first thought. Basically, you can "buy" an action for less, than it would have cost you in a first place. But that's not so easy, because EVERYBODY will want it. And that drives the price up. Most of the time you will pay more for that action than you normally would, but that turns out to be ok, because that's an additional action out of your own turn and it may mean additional money cards, or points, or other. While person auctioning the action get additional money, which is veeery helpful when their turn comes.

Don't underestimate the power of auctioning an action in this game!! 

This game is almost a race game to score the 33 points in order to win. But it's not a straight away race. Nice way of gaining points on different levels. And did I mention to auction your unused actions??... Great game!

Not really original, and the number of viable strategies is not the highest, but the game is agreable (light mix of management and set collection).

A big edition mistake: no score track! to count the points at the end of each turn is a real pain -from the second game on, we used a sheet of paper.

Leo Colovini has designed numerous clever and pleasant games, some of which I rather enjoy.  None, however, have captured my fancy as much as The Dutch Golden Age.  His creativity is in full bloom here, and the wide latitude the system provides for players to create clever moves and pursue various strategies is tactics is brilliant.  There are multiple strategies and combinations of strategies to pursue, which helps each game feel fresh and different.  The variety of mechanisms blend together well, and players are challenged each game to find the proper strategies and combinations that will lead them to victory.  This is, in my opinion, Colovini's best.

A light-medium game, with some randomness.  As can be expected from Phalanx, the board is nice, as are the components.

Fairly easy to learn and quick to play.  Rules translations is OK, although some points are not clear, and there are a few word transpositions...

In the setup for example, one places 1 Influence marker (cardboard token) and two Movement tokens (wooden cylinder).  They why it is described in the manual, it would seem they have this reversed, as they list the number of each token remaining, which are the totals for the OTHER pieces.  After setup, you should have the following remaining (unless I interpretted things wrong):

3 Movement tokens
5 Influence markers

After a few plays of this game, I'm not a huge fan.  It definitely isn't very fun with 4.  I think that the yellow territories have a huge advantage over other paths to victory.  I drew 9 blue cards in my last game only making 1 set of 3.

All in all, I think this is the Euro version of monopoly.  You roll the dice and move, and then you take a couple actions.  The game tends to be fairly static.  I will play, but might mock you a little for suggesting the game.

This is reasonably simple game with a bit of luck.  Newbie players that don't get a green province are likely to loose and have a negative opinion about the game.

As Mark pointed out the free action and income potential of controlling a province also gives you a lot of victory points.  It would probably be better if province control gave you few if any victory points.  Also the outside track is too random to do more than randomly give everyone differing amounts of income. 

I have yet to see an arts patron win.  I think the green and yellow are the best provinces / guilds early on.  Grey is next best.  Blue is more useful in the mid-game.

You gain and place markers on the map. A piece moves around an outside track and that determines earnings based on the regions you control. Then various cards can be purchased to help generate victory points. You can also auction off the various actions. This auction can add an unpredictable element to the game since different players perceive and use this in different ways. I had enough cash so didn't auction much.

A solidly designed pure Euro. Initial impression is that there may be little real depth here, but would need to play again before I could state that opinion with any conviction. I like the Settlers-esque income from die rolls each turn. It's unfortunate that the board has very little relevance to gameplay.

RATING: 6
In the beginning players take the core decision on their main strategy: go for trade or colonies, support that with movement tokens or paintings.

I managed to win with a trade strategy against a colony strategy but that may have been because the third player in the beginning always auctioned of his trade action and I had the most money to buy it. If that hadn't happened the colony strategy could possibly be dominant although heavily luck-dependent. If experienced players compete for the colonies the winner simply could be decided by luck of the draw who gets the needed set first.

Money wasn't a scarce resource in my game so the luck of the dice wasn't decisive. Furthermore, you can increase your chances considerably by increasing your presence on the board.

All in all, an ok game with very beautiful components that lacks the ultimate spark to become a good game.

Some of the actions are more important than the others. And because every player can't get their influence tokens to those more important places the balance is more or less ruined. But I really liked the overall game mechanic and how you get and can use those cards. Luck has also a quite major element in the game which is (for me) OK. I play this for sure, but I don't find any reason why should I own this.

While this might scare most away, bear with me:

This game is like Roulette crossed with Slots.

The crazy part is that there are definite strategies and the game does a good job of mitigating it's own luck factor.

The outer track of the board is Roulette; two regions of the board pay out or everyone gets paid for one of 5 merchant or the king. There are cards you can gain to increase this payout. Every card that provides a bonus is keyed to a specific region, but also pays out on all merchants and king cumulatively.

The cards themselves are like slots. You activate regions where you have influence markers allowing for a random pull from that color deck. There's some set collection involved for some decks while one is all bonus vps or payout increases. There are however, ways to get multiple pulls, and the volume mitigates luck here.

The whole game is one big gamble yet it doesn't feel totally random nor a big mess. 

One thing is for sure: This is one of Colovini's best.

This is not a bad game, but I don't know who to recommend it to.
Its quite random, and has at the same time a fair bit of downtime and a distinct runaway-leader issue. 
It is however quite entertaining in between - you get these turns where everything works out and the rock just keeps rolling, and those are enjoyable, even if the other players just have to wait for you to get through the moves.

I think I could pass it on succesfully to someone who needs to get on from Monopoly and Risk (and has a thing for the Netherlands at the same time ...). 
Such a player would really make this games worth.

Played a few games with some rules mistakes, it was fun and interesting but seemed badly balanced.
Now played with the correct rules, and the game balance seems just right now. It's a relatively quick game with a few different strategies to try, but also with a significant amount of luck. That's not necessarily bad in a game that plays under an hour, but still it prevents it from being really great for me. It's just one of many nice games.

Fine as this game is for three or four players, it is just as good with two:  When a player wants to auction an action, he names a price (some multiple of 1/2 guilder).  The other player either pays the price, taking the action, or refuses the offer, in which case the action is lost.  This makes for a fast and satisfying game.  The artwork is very attractive, but there is not enough money (miniature poker chips work well).

Decent amount of decisions, luck and things to do.  Comes together well.  Plays relatively fast.  Not sure how important the Movement Tokens are, especially in the mid-to-late game (e.g., providing 1 VP at 5 Cost).

Beautiful graphic design on a stiff, tight game. The auction feels shoe-horned in but still works well enough in the context of the player actions. Certainly unlike anything else I've played.

While the game is fluid, I found nothing particulary attractive to me, and a lot of luck on the ship cards makes some strategy completely random, and really doesn't appeal to me. Maybe I would have like better if having all the jokers in the grey pile, while all specific cards (canon, captain and ship) in the blue pile, so you can "choose" a bit more what you want to draw. I found also the tulip 2 for 12 a bit strong in the early game while 3 for 20 too long to be rewarding (again it depends of the order of your draw). At the end it feels also a bit repetitive.

RATING: 7
A quite abstract, lightish engine building game. There's a heavy emphasis on luck of the draw, and  Settlers-style dice rolling for resources (i.e. money) is a main mechanism as well. Even though the decisions on your turn may appear rather obvious, there seems to be a few different strategic paths to try out.

A bit longish with four players: Gets somewhat repetitive and the final points depend very heavily on luck of the draw. Very quick with three players.

E' un gioco che non mi è dispiaciuto grazie probabilmente ad una grafica vivace e ad un tentativo di ambientazione che per Colovini è quasi una novità. Trovo che ci sia un po' di sbilanciamento a favore del primo giocatore a scalare fino all'ultimo, soprattutto se giocato in 4 (il mio consiglio è di giocarlo in 3). Il gioco è ambientato nei Paesi Bassi e, governando le varie regioni ,si potranno avere benefici o offrire gli stessi benefici agli altri giocatori che li faranno propri tramite aste. I benefici, sotto forma di carte, dovranno essere pescati casualmente, questo aspetto rende il gioco soggetto al caso in quanto trovo esistano carte particolarmente buone ed altre meno. Rivenduto anche se non è un  brutto gioco.

If ever a game is decided by the opening setup, this must be a leading candidate. There are 5 possible actions in the game (get a cash / vp / set / random card, or place a worker). Each action is provided by owning one of its 2 areas on the board. You get one during setup, and earn others by placing workers. Then you can do that action for the rest of the game. If anyone else wants to do it, their only option is to pay off to the bank for the right, but that right will only remain until someone else pays higher. It gets expensive. So the early game is a quick grab for the areas on the board in the combinations you think can win you the game. The obvious two ways to earn the freemasonly symbolically important 33 VPs you need to win the game are VP and set cards so that seems to be the prime target, and then choose cash or random or workers as your supplemental strategy. That's all locked in after a few turns, so then you play the game out for the next 45 minutes to see which strategy got luckiest with the cards this time. There's a few other things - random money receipts, plus you can auction off actions you don't want to do to raise money (generally to do your other actions) which allow other players to do things they normally wouldn't. But with only 2 or 3 buyers, which may or may not be interested or have the cash, they're fairly insipid things. I wouldn't mind playing a few times to see how it plays out trying the different approaches, but it'd be as an intellectual exercise rather than for the joy of playing. In the end, the game doesn't induce much of either fun or tension.

RATING: 6
I agree with Enrico. All the really interesting decisions are done early in the game and with four players, so may never get to do what you wanted to do when you start. Once you have chosen a course of action, you are pretty much stuck with it because shifting strategies is very hard to do. 

It is not a "bad" game. In fact, it does many things well. I just don't find it to be an especially memorable gaming experience. That said, I would play it again if the opportunity presents itself. It is enjoyable in the same way eating chips is enjoyable. Both are enjoyable at the time but neither one is a memorable experience.

Quite luck dependend. But the main problem is that it feels very scripted: About 80% of the decisions are automatic. The rest is usually not that meaningful. So you run on autopilot most of the game (safe from some decisions early on)

This is a game with a fair bit of luck with the cards, but that luck decreases if you move from lucky drawing card moves to safer painting actions nearer the end. Only the colony cards can produce huge lucky swings near the end, but that's a valid strategy option. Most of all the game moves quickly between players and is fun. There are plenty of different paths to take to earning your points and that'll keep me coming back for a few games yet. With only about six pages of rules it can be picked up and you'll be into it in ten minutes with no experienced players at the table. There are a couple of confusing rules regarding costs - guild actions always cost the 3 or 5 Guilder normal cost and placing an influence on a colony has no monetary cost in addition to the cards (the money value is only for the colony cards). Not a big issue, but the only stumbling block we have had regarding rules.

I enjoyed it more than I expected. The dice rolling movement for the King is simple and works. Everything seems well balanced enough. Not too heavy and not too light, it'll take about 90 minutes with experienced players. (Auctions lengthen the game time, but keep all players engaged even when it isn't their turn.) No, it's not a particularly deep game that has much historical feel. But the simplicity has its own attraction.

One final point: The game is crying out for a score track. You must, must, must use something as a score track or else the final turns become a massive counting orgy.

The players are witnesses of the best years in Holland History as exploration, arts, guilds and commerce flourished.  They try to get points out of these activities having markers around the board.  Money is tigh, so as the tense end, in which everything counts.  Very pleasant surprise, specially for a Leo Colovini game, an author that that I don't like much because of the dryness of his designs.  This one can be felt abstract for sure, but the theme is certainly there and works very well.  Don't let the pawn and the dice fool you as this in not a roll and move game.  That mechanic is just for aleatory asignation of money and it can be seen better as a small casino in which players place their chips hoping to get profits out of them to put some more.

RATING: N/A
After just 1 3p game I think this might be better with 4. Some of the rules are simply not clearly written in the rulebook (which looks nice, and aside from being inaccurate and incomplete is actually very good).

In particular, the setup is weird in that it says to start with 1 Influence marker, leaving the other 4 as your supply (but there are 5 others) - and it says to start with 2 movement tokens on the board with the other 4 as your supply (but there are only 3 others). 

It's not clear if you're allowed to bid yourself when auctioning off an action (I can see reasons why it would be better to, and better not to do so), and the Move action seems to be a non-action because you can plop the movement tokens down wherever you want when you get them, there's not much reason to move, unless I guess if someone else beats you to the influence marker.

Interesting set collecting game. Not sure if the cards are too random. Maybe needs a few house rule tweaks... Maybe each pile of cards should have two face up? Placement at the beginning seems unbalanced, maybe players should place one piece at a time and no doubling up any pieces in any province at the start. No moving your cardboard discs... once played they should be locked in (with exception to the guild where your piece may come back to you).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very clever system where, much like Goa, you want to get control of actions to make money off of on your turn so that you can purchase efficient actions on other people's turns.  Still, you want to allow yourself to take advantage of your own actions to move yourself into a stronger position of power.  Great chain reaction power moves, make for an exciting game.

There is a lot of luck in the game, and sometimes you just can't get a break on the cards.  With the exception of sailing, your luck will become insignificant with persistence.  Sailing, well, at the very least if you take all the cannons then it will be harder for other people to get into the Indies as well (they need your cannons).  In some ways it is a shame that you can't do something like take a guild action to auction what you have in your hand...perhaps a variant.

Light enough that it doesn't feel like you are bogged down, but there is enough here to make you feel like you are playing a substantial game.  Very nice.

Anyway, there are some ambiguities and questionable bits to the rules. I play open money, can't move used chits, set up with players placing one piece at a time with none of your three pieces in the same region, and only play cards on your turn.

2 plays, 4er

I enjoy Settlers; this is sort of like that game (random income, based on spreading presence in different locations; race to VP target), with a different kind of trading (selling your actions) and with a bunch of extra stuff going on. 

I quite like the game! It's a Colovini game, but surprisingly doesn't feel totally abstracted -- I guess we have to thank Giuseppe Baù for that? It feels a lot like Settlers, but with many more options. The luck of the dice also seems to be much less important here: you get only marginal income from them, especially early on. Instead, you're going to make money by auctioning your actions and by turning in sets of cards. You have multiple paths to victory, too: income from tulips or goods, VP from Indies or art (maybe from provinces?). Definitely would play this one again.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/939765/]FAQ[/url]

[b]--- Rules Summary ---[/b]
The board shows a map of the Netherlands, divided into several colored provinces. There's also a Guild area (same 5 colors), an export area (Indies), and a track around the edge showing pairs of provinces or faces. Shuffle each of the decks (same 5 colors). Players each start with:
- 5 movement pawns
- 6 influence tokens
- 10 guilders
Determine random start player. In turn order, players place their influence tokens. Then, again in order, they place both pawns (max total 2 pawns/province -- during setup only). Last player chooses a starting location on the outer track for the Income Pawn.

[u]Your Turn[/u]
1. Roll 2d6; move Income Pawn clockwise as many spaces. The space it lands on pays income:
... in each province, movement pawns earn 1 guilder, influence tokens earn 2
... any governor cards for those provinces also pay 1
... if space shows a face instead of provinces, everyone earns 1 or 3 guilders as indicated
2. Take any combination of Free Actions and Special Actions available, in any order. May also auction off a Special Action from [i]the provinces[/i] (not Guilds or Indies)
3. Unflip any used influence markers.
4. Announce VP total, then pass the dice

[u]Free Actions[/u] (unlimited)
- Take Control of a Guild (that you don't already control): pay the minimum price available on chart (next space above marker already there), place your influence marker there; previous controller gets their marker back
- Move Pawns: costs 1/2 guilder per border crossed; all provinces are adjacent to nearest province (i.e., ignore rivers; Holland [i]is[/i] adjacent to Zeeland and Friesland))
- Place Influence: convert 3 of your pawns in a province to an influence marker
- Play a Set of Cards
NOTE: if all influence markers in your Supply have been used, you may use a previously placed UNUSED one; however, may NOT do this to gain control of a Guild.

[u]Special Actions[/u] (one/influence marker: flip your marker to take an action of the color where marker is located)
- Green: pay 5 to place a new movement pawn on the board, into any province
- Red: either pay 3 to draw a new artist, or pay 1 to an artist you already have (after paying 1-6, as indicated, they become worth 3-8 VP)
- Blue: pay 3 to draw a card. On your turn, you may turn in a set of 3 (ship, captain, cannon; flags are wild) place an influence marker (a "colony") in the Indies.
- Yellow: pay 3 to draw a card. At any time, you may turn in a set of 1/2/3 for 5/12/20 guilders.
- Brown (Indies): pay cost indicated (2-7) to draw a goods card; may turn in a set of 1/2/3 for 7/16/27 guilders
- Gray: pay 3 to draw a card (mix of VP cards, governor cards which give you income and VP, yellow/blue cards, and a dice card which you can use in a later turn instead of rolling the 2d6)
NOTE: all cards acquired are kept face up in display. You may only turn sets in on your own turn.

[u]Auctions[/u]
- markers are flipped (used), even if no one bids
- may not bid on your own auction
- may only auction off Province actions (not Guilds or Indies)

[u]Winning the Game[/u]
- VP calculated at end of each player turn:
... 1 per 10 guilders
... 1 per influence marker in the Provinces
... 4 per influence marker in the Provinces
... 5 or 6 per influence marker in the Indies (as indicated)
- The first player to 33 VP [i]at the end of their turn[/i] wins!

Well, this is decent enough I guess. The era of Dutch history deserves a game where the theme is better implemented. It's still pretty abstract and there are some glaring errors. But there's interaction, possibilites for clever play and meaningful choices that it's nice enough to play once in a while. Every game I played ended differently, so there seems enough scope for variability.

RATING: 5.1
Very light quasi-economic game. Despite the fact the play goes pretty quickly and smooth, the player has not enough choices and a lot of things are decided at random. You have to select correct combination of provinces at start (what is not always possible as selections are made in turns) and then act as fast as you can unless the money runs out. Then you're selling your actions to other players to get some money back and again, then, with some money back you can maximize your efforts again to gain more money or victory points -- of course in the limits game puts upon you. Most of things you can win is decided at random, so in good turn you have a plenty of money or opportunities to win victory points and in the bad a plenty of cards which give you nothing. 
I have a feeling that this game was heavily simplified or the aim was a bit too low. Or both. Kinda family game in historical disguise, try first if you have kids, don't bother too much with if you're gamer. My first play was not too bad but randomness make me think it is not worth playing again.

I'm kind of surprised I liked this one as much as I did, since it tends to be the sort of game I find boring. But I was drawn into playing by the stylish art and bits, and ended up really enjoying myself. The roll-and-move mechanic to add some semi-random income kept the game from feeling too scripted, and there was a nice variety of viable approaches. I am a little bothered that a game that seems to promise multiple paths to victory has one (Grain) that seems to be a necessary component for winning, but it was still quite fun and I'd play again.

Seventeenth century Netherlands, investing to earn actions which bring more income or VPs through artistic, scientific, economic, political or trade paths. Reading the rules, you get the impression of extensive movement between the provinces, but this only really happens in the early game until influence is established. From then on its a question of using your influence to acquire more (or different) actions, to perform investment-actions or to sell your influence to allow other players to take actions. I wish there was some form of scoring track, though.

RATING: 2
Not all that glitters is gold. This game comes as close to being broken as can be. Seriously, mix Monopoly and Settlers of Catan for randomness square and add some non-intuitive board artwork. This one exceeds Thebes by far in luck, but on the downhand it doesn’t have theme. It is yet another set-collection paste-on annoyance of the worst kind. And not only is the game completely random, there is overpowered routes to top it off. The one player focussing on blue cards eventually had in between 30 or 40 gold to spend while everyone else was in between 5 – 15. 
With that huge a difference you can’t do anything to get back into the game. Giving your stuff free to auctions was more or less a joke. Most of the time there was just one player who could afterwards afford to use the action offered, so the auctioneer ended up getting 0.5 of a Gulden. The benefit of the action however is way bigger so when not using your actions it doesn't remotely pay off to auction it away and instead drop that action, but then you know the game will take even longer.
Now, some might argue that a score of 33-31-28-26 speaks for a good balance. I’d rather put it this way: You can’t do much to not get points, but you can sit back and watch while this game plays you. You'd be better advised to do so anyway. 

There’s two good things about this game admittedly:

-	The card artwork is very nice
-	Ridiculing this game was fun enough for once and made up for some hilarious interaction

I just wanted it to be over. One of the worst gaming experiences ever

Solid game that offers something for everyone. Bidding, area control, resource management, multiple victory paths,building, plus a small bit of chance. Best of all it's flat out fun to play. 

Like many games, jump in and play, reread the rules (not the clearest at first) and find out you were playing it wrong, then go again. After play 2, the strategies are clearer. The third play is a charm.

A scoring track is needed as it takes 33 points to win as opposed to Catan's 10.

There's a lot of randomness in this game relative to the amount of stuff going on. I didn't really care for the lack of any 100% guaranteed method of getting income with any given action on a game that relies so heavily on having money available to you.

Played at Great Hall (Damen's game). Interesting game that looks complicated, but is really simple. Players control certain provinces, guilds, or spice islands which let them do certain things during their turn (for a price). 

The game seems to "blow up" at times, as players will get huge inputs of money which they can use immediately to generate a whole bunch more money and hence more points. A lot of this depends on the cards you draw.

Initial impression.  Solid components but maybe not in the "gamer's game" category.  Still looks to be fun.  Note, I am a Leo Colovini game fan and his designs tend towards abstracted games with a pasted on theme and a touch of chaos (or luck) but they're still good.

I liked this game a fair amount, but I can see that others might not "get" it.  There is clearly luck involved (which is fine to me for a game of this length), but I suspect what people miss is the fact that this is really an auction game hidden in a bunch of other mechanics. 

While it doesn't appear this way in the beginning, the game has an auction it and keep the money or use the action yourself and pay the money mechanic like many other auction games.  But, this mechanic seemed hidden in our first foray into the game.  I think that once we figure this out, the game was very tense and enjoyable.

If you think of the game as - get territory, buy actions, it is pretty random.  But, if you start digging deeper into the auctions, I think there is a lot to like here.

Dit spel bewijst maar weer dat smaken verschillen. Het spel heeft een paar mechanieken die je eigenlijk nergens anders vind. Onder andere een gildesysteem, waarmee je acties mag doen als je een hogere contributie betaald dan je voorganger. Deze mag dan geen actie meer doen van dat gilde. Ook het veilen van je eigen acties zie ik niet vaak.

Het spel heeft wel een beetje balansproblemen, zoals de geluksfactor van het inkomen iedere beurt. Maar toch heb ik het gevoel dat je als speler meer invloed hierop hebt dan het zich eerst voordoet.

Like it.  More players the better.  Can suffer from poor player syndrome if a player's properties aren't getting rolled, especially at the beginning of the game. Perhaps a bit dry but not overly Euro (ala Puerto Rico or such). Theme carries over just enough to keep me interested.  Overall, enjoy playing it.

Listed as a 3 player, but plays fine as 2 player, provided you modify the auction phase where the opponent simply offers an amount and the active player counters the offer or accepts.

I put off buying this for a long time, when I finally got it and played, I realized I had a winner for my tastes...set collection and area control with just a  tiny smidge of "Catanishness" and "Monopolyishness", and I do mean a tiny smidge...

A glorified Monopoly with a VP accruement engine tacked on.  How well a person does is incredibly reliant on luck, not only initially on the dice roll, since that's your major source of income at the start, but later more on the card draw, so you can keep the influx of money going which allows you to take more actions on your turn.  There's is literally no strategy to it, your choices are pretty straightforward.  Make revenue and turn them into points.  Your turn could take one or five minutes depending on how lucky you are.  Simple and shallow for those looking for an Euro flavor to their average roll and move games.

Have to play more to make up my mind. First inpmressions: dry, dry and dry. But I like dry.

Nobody wanted to play this with me and the solo variant is just a boring race to beat your previous score, so I sold it. Miss it a little.

A lovely improvement over The Bronze Age...
streamlined to where you don't need to do "great math" on adding money from resources, calculating if you gained more of a resource, the devs cost much less, and no "discard goods in excess of 6".  That said, I'm sure people will still be forgetting things like resolving disasters and Feeding, but that seems truly to be the heart of the game.

Ports vs. Provinces in where the former gives engine and less maintenance, but you may not get as much out of it if you roll too poorly (or even too well), vs. the latter that gives you windfall bonus and more pts, but at the cost of higher maintenance.

Fate die adds a nice twist to the game, and stuff like Omens (turn one die into anything you'd like) helps mitigate luck

Having Tribute and its system is a nice, 3rd option for winning or supplementing your score.  In Bronze Age, it was either Monuments or Developments.  For some players, 2/3 of their score was from here.

THEME
Things are heavily abstracted, and bit of a paste up, but still there.  Developments do what you'd think they would do, etc.

It really is "spreadsheet oriented", as I even implemented this in Excel format.  However, that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Just depends on your taste in games.

CONS
Still takes too long... well, when players know the game better, turns should go quicker, and even enable the Full game (vs. the short game), but half an hour per player has been the unfortunately high ball figure

Higher downtime between turns...  2p ain't bad.  3p, it can be noticeable.  4p is more pronounced.  Only thing to do is to play quicker.  Else, this can be a more uncommon moment for other players to chat and catch up

I'm not a fan.  The added complexity did not increase the fun or engagement.  It also lost much of the fun of the first game (the connected peg movement).  Plus the rules are economical to the point of breaking understandability.  For a box twice the size of the first, it was half as fun.

RATING: 7
Szerintem jobb mint a bronzkori változat. Mélyebb, nehezebb, már a legelején sem egyértelmű mit kellene csinálni. A bronzosban evidens, hogy legalább néhány plusz várost fel kell húznunk rögtön az elején, sőt ha kieggel játsszuk, jellemzően 6 de inkább 7 várossal muszáj játszani, különben nem sok esély van. Itt viszont már kezdéskor dilemmát jelent, hogy inkább 2 kikötővel vagy inkább 2 tartománnyal induljunk-e, és későbbiekben is van létjogosultsága mindkét típusnak. Néhány csapás sokkal árnyaltabb lett, mint az elődnél: megjelenik a játékban a csata. Nem fix minusz pontot kapunk, hanem meg kell küzdenünk egy külső ellenséggel, akit akár le is győzhetünk, és zsákmányolhatunk tőle. A sokféle áru helyett a fatáblán a csata miatt új kategóriák jelennek meg (sereg, hajó), cserébe az áruk használata egyszerűsödött. Megjelenik a Sors kocka, amin van pár ötletes dolog, kedvencem az ómen eredmény, ami gyakorlatilag egy joker. Vagy pl. ha a többiek gyengébbek, akkor megfelelő dobással tőlük is zsákmányolhatunk (bár játéktechnikailag nem szenvednek kárt, csak mi nyerünk rajta), ha nem akadályozzák meg.
Egyelőre csak a rövid változatot próbáltuk, de annyira ez se rövid. A hosszú szerintem simán van egy óra még két főnél is. Érdekes, hogy míg a bronzosnál evidens rutinművelet a városok felhúzása az elején, addig itt simán leragadhatunk 3-4 tartománynál és/vagy kikötőnél, ráadásul nekünk az alkotásra sem jutott emberünk. Sokkal nehezebbnek tűnik itt a kibontakozás.
A mediterrán kieggel is kipróbáltuk, valószínűleg a jövőben csak azzal játsszuk majd, mert azzal még jobb.
Egy negatívumot mondanék: bizonyos kombinációknál néhány kockadobás haszontalan lehet (pl. a bőség vagy aszály teljesen irreleváns, ha nem dobunk kajakockát, de a zsákmányolós dobás sem ér semmit, ha mi vagyunk a leggyengébbek), azt hiszem a bronzosnál nem nagyon van ilyen.
Összefoglalva: jobb mint a bronzos, 2 parti alapján nagyon sokutasnak tűnik, ezért most azt mondom, a jövőben szívesebben játszanék ezzel, bár azt is szeretem továbbra is. Ha valaki a másikban az egyszerűségét szereti, akkor lehet hogy megmarad annál.
---
5 parti után úgy tűnik, a tartomány jobb, mint a kikötő, de nehéz megmondani, mennyit érdemes gyorsan megszerezni. 4 körül már elérheti a maximumot a sereg, így a többi szinttel kicsit érdemes lehet várni?!
---
10+ parti után azt mondom: szerencsére jópár stratégia életképes lehet. Kieggel játsszuk, a térképen lévő 1 mezős kolóniákra mindenképp érdemes rámenni, sőt ha a többiek hagyják, akkor a tisztán kolóniás stratégiára is esetleg. De a tisztán sereges stratégiát is próbáltuk (hajókkal együtt támadni), az is jó lehet. Az alkotásokat nagyon gyengének éreztük, de legutóbb épp tisztán alkotásos stratégia nyert. De a legjobbak a kevertek (pl. sereg+kolóniák). Szerintem a kieggel együtt simán benne van 100 parti, nagyon jól eltalálták, nálam kenterbe veri most már a bronzosat.

So well, the Tribute path seems a bit to powerfull and so you will much invest in own military.
Different enough to Late Bronze Age and so a reason to play these two. Ports are important for getting much goods, for an easier way to your developments. I prefer the long game, there you must go for 50 Tribute, 7 Developments or all Monuments build up!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the same vein as Roll Through the Ages, but with some new interesting choices to make. The introduction of armies is neat, as well as all of the new developments. The fate die adds another level of randomness to the game which can really make or break you, but all around a good game. Not sure you need to own both the original and this one though.

Ugh - overlong, overwrought, painful downtime, tedious. Also surprisingly hard to understand from the rules, for a relatively simple game - not sure what went wrong there, if it's just the overall clunkiness of the game that makes it hard to understand, or if the rules could be better, but I think it's just the inelegance of the game itself. Everything I don't like about Roll Through the Ages with few of the previous game's features. Just get Ciub, Tom's excellent remake of To Crown a King, or Roll for the Galaxy.

RATING: 7
While the tribute/conquest rules promise more interaction than the Bronze Age, the rate of occurrence off the fate die is low- though you'll get more hits with the full 4 players. While I have yet to play with four, I'd lean towards the Late Bronze Age as my favorite in the series right now. An additional annoyance is the use of a full-size box; the game didn't really need it, and you have a huge insert to contain a relatively small number of parts.

Since I'm such a big fan of RttA: The Bronze Age, I knew I needed to try this sequel. I'd sum it up by saying it's a good option if you like the original and want a deeper challenge. But I'm not sure I'd recommend it to someone new to gaming.

While keeping some of the original mechanisms, Iron Age adds in a military challenge element, and building up your army and ships doesn't come cheap. There are some interesting new developments that can help you. There is also a "fate die" which will significantly change how your turn goes.

I'm disappointed in the rulebook - it felt needlessly confusing, and just needed more space to be clear. I also don't understand why the reference sheets only explain the developments, with the same text printed on both sides! That plus the over-sized box feel like a real waste.

RATING: 5
Civ themed King of Tokyo. Roll dice and resolve effects with a civilization theme of getting workers, food, technology.

As a dice game, rolling for resources isn't as fun as combat. As a typical civ building game, the decisions the dice present you aren't interesting enough. 

Not a fan of crib sheets since it feels like an exercise in accounting. The wooden peg resource tracks is neat to see rather than the usual markers on a board. Chunky custom wooden dice are both cool but dry due to the theme. Besides that, the art is nonexistent.

Interaction is low and like King of Tokyo, you are just waiting for your turn to roll dice.

A civ-builder played with dice and a peg board.  It does not come close to replicating Through the Ages, so mind the branding on this one.

Still, it's dice allocation like Roll for the Galaxy, so you should know what to expect.  Players mark off their advancements on a sheet and use the pegboard to track resources.

More complex & gamer-ish version of The Bronze Age.  See my review: 
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1402614

with [gameid=150927]

The edition that includes the expansion has a separate entry in the BGG database: [gameid=167828]

Status: Traded

The bottom line: "Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age by Tom Lehmann is a welcome follow-up to Matt Leacock's popular Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age, which uses dice to provide a civ-flavoured experience in a compressed time frame. Most serious gamers will greatly enjoy the additional complexity and strategic choices that The Iron Age offers, and consider it to be a solid improvement over the original game. While there are a number of civilization themed dice games on the market, Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age is a strong contender in this field. It will especially be enjoyed by people who like the original game but are looking for a more challenging and rewarding experience with greater depth and strategy."

I enjoy Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age, it doesn't see the table often but years later it still gets the occasional play. However, its appearance on Yucata.de is responsible for 13 of my 26 plays modest One fear I had is that Iron Age might be too similar to Bronze Age to be worth investigating, but I think that fear is unfounded. Iron Age looks like a considerably different game. Goods have been streamlined to two types, players can now recruit armies and build a navy ships, instead of cities you can build either ports or provinces each with its own benefits. The different currencies in the game are much more woven together in Iron Age. Food is needed to feed provinces and build armies. Population is needed to build armies, monuments, provinces, and ports. Goods are needed to build ports, build ships, and buy developments. Building provinces gives you armies and victory points. Building ports increases your ability to generate goods.

You roll a number of dice equal your number of ports or provinces, whichever is greater. So players are incentivized to specialize, but there are good reasons to diversify as well. The game seems more accommodating of differing strategies than Bronze Age. It's a hard thing to accomplish in a small dice game and it seems like they've done a great job creating interesting player decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm not sure if I really prefer the changes to the game. I definitely like the fate dice with the omen symbol, but the game I played was very much weighted toward the player that started out with a province. Food is still extremely easy to come by, but if you're going for the port strategy you have no use for it. After a few more plays I hope to update.

Roll Through the Ages: The Iron Age feels like the natural evolution of Roll Through the Ages: Bronze Age and The Later Bronze Age. There are now two ways to get more dice instead of one, more developments, streamlined goods, added military, more way to get bonuses... So overall more choices to be made. That makes Iron Age an interesting dice game for hobby gamers. For beginners and casual gamers I'd recommend Bronze Age instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good, fun dice-rolling game which uses the Yahtzee mechanic of rolling dice with the option of up to two re-rolls.  The game offers two routes to pursue, either provinces or ports, although one is not committed to one or the other i.e. you can pursue a balanced strategy.  This seems like it would be a great solo game.  From what I understand, it seems like it's better than Bronze Age (I've never played Bronze Age) as it offers more, however, if you're going to primarily use this game to play with newbies or kids then Bronze Age might be the better option.

This one is an improvement on the original Roll Through the Ages in that there are some more decisions to make and paths to follow, but it's still essentially a solo affair. There just isn't much difference in the fact that other people are playing as well. I don't see much of the point of it.

I enjoyed getting to try this successor to The Bronze Age. It has some interesting concepts and I'd be willing to play it again. Though I doubt I'd ask for it. Frankly its Bronze Age on steroids. And like muscle men who are puffed up on that drug, they may be able to lift weights better, but they often look somewhat freakish. Or to use a line from the movie Amadeus, this game has "too many notes". There's just a bit too much going on in Iron Age. I'm not saying it designed poorly. I merely feel most casual players who can grasp Bronze Age easily will balk at this game that takes twice the effort. Now I'm sure there are many who do want "more". Fine. I'm just not one of them. One production fault I'll mention that had plagued early sets of The Bronze Age, faded images on some dice, and had been "fixed" in later production runs, was back in the Iron age copy I played . I found that odd, being under the impression the publisher had permanently corrected this stamping error years ago.

RATING: 7
Did not know it was a Lehmann game.  Better than I expected, especially after what I heard of the Bronze age game.  Quite a few choices to make, although gaining dice seems to be an obvious first goal.  Wish there were ways to attack your neighbors that were more effective, and that the disasters would scale a bit as you get more powerful, as the barbarians are soon quite lame, and who rolls five disasters?

Played solo and it is an ok diversion.  Didn't score to high, though, probably meaning I need to ramp up the number of dice thrown more quickly.  Can see playing a few times.

Reminder to self and anyone reading: Make sure there is a feasible way (and not too costly) of also getting the expansion board that would be included for the kickstarter version. (Especially for whatever German publisher picks this up it would not be the first time of giving up a game and never making the expansion.)

For the moment this is not going to be purchased any time soon. Given how little play its predecessor gets I cannot imagine that this would see enough play, even as a Tom Lehmann game.

Definitely a *lot* heavier than Bronze Age.  Despite being dice based, having similar names, and sharing some iconography, Iron Age and Bronze Age feel like totally different games.  This is closer to a heavier Civ game like Nations or Through the Ages.  It's demonstrably shorter than those, but has quite a bit of weight to it.  I need to play it a few more times before deciding on a final rating.

RATING: 7
"Sequel to Roll Through the Ages, which generally adds complexity. After just one solo game, I don't yet know if the combat and tribute system will be more interaction than I enjoy. Rating of 7 is very preliminary."

What I like:
- Streamlining the goods system is probably wise, although I miss some of the strategy of the Bronze Age system
- Has a lot of the good of the Bronze age, and new twists seem interesting

What I don't like:
- Seems a bit complicated for what it's trying to do
- The fate die seems extraneous
- The bigger box doesn't seem necessary
- Too bad the Mediterranean expansion is expensive and/or hard to get

I would put the weight at 2.6, higher than BGG voters. Maybe with more plays the combat and tribute systems will seem less complex than they appear at first glance.

RATING: 8.5
Very good dice game. Tom Lehmann's gift lies obviously in dice games (although RftG is my favourite Lehmann game). This really built well on the original dice game by Matt, it just added a lot more decisions and options to the game. It's great being able to pursuit so many different paths to victory.

A great dice game if you prefer playing a dice game that picks a little more on your brains than the usual yatzee spin-off (which I enjoy too).

Overall a great game.

Some of the criticisms of RttA: The Bronze Age still apply here.  There is just too much downtime for a dice game to play this with 4 people.  I would cap the number of players at 3.  It is probably best with 2 and is also a good solo game.  There are more developments to choose from now.  The choice of going ports or provinces is interesting and the fate die adds a nice twist.  For these reasons, I do rank it higher than the previous version.

I'm not sure exactly what it is I don't like about this game.  I think the solo game ends before you can get an engine going.  I think the fate die, while a good idea, is swingy.  I like the idea of military and conquest but it seems like it is abstracted down to the point of being a throwaway action.  I think the box is too big for what it is as well.  I guess the box sums up my feeling on the game - that its trying to be something that its not.  It is supposed to be more strategic but it feels more like extra columns on a spreadsheet.

I am spectacularly bad at this game.

My issue with this one is that it is very hard to absorb all the rules. In relatively complex games, there's usually a component or image that corresponds to an action that you can do in this game. -- it's hard to visualize what I'm supposed to do with a particular resource.

Despite superficial similarities, this is a very different game from the prior RttA Bronze/Late Bronze.  It has a similar feel, but the strategies are entirely different.  Both will be staying on my shelf!

I like it solo and it looks promising with more players.  It is a much more complex game than its predecessors, and it seems to have put that complexity to good use.  It looks like it is well balanced with quite a few paths to victory and several ways to use each type of resource.

update: I'm a little worried that military strategies are too strong, based on several solo plays.  Gaining tribute from barbarian attacks is pretty powerful!  My best scores have all been heavy military and they are reliably better than monument or development based strategies.

To me it's too long for a filler game, too 'complicated' as a gateway game and (same as bronze age) far too random for a 'proper' game. Maybe my opinion will change after having it played a few times more, but for now I'll stick with its bronze age predecessor.

RATING: 6
I'm a sucker for a civilisation game, but I might be burnt out on recent dice rollers. It just feels that for an hour I'd rather play something else than this. It's not a bad game, but the effort of going through the convoluted play order here detracts from my enjoyment of the game. Everything must be done in a strict order and particularly in the case of disaster dice this is a stop start affair counting goods, moving to disasters... then use the population segment of the dice. It's not a smooth order like it was with The Bronze Age. On the other hand I like the port and province split (even if I do think the province only route is safer and the stronger of the two). A little player interaction thrown in with the tribute demands is nice too. Plays a bit slow with four players.

The Fate die is a bit dull. One more food per die, one less, choose a die face, disaster and two province strong actions. A province aggression action and a port action might have been nice. As is there's 50% chance each roll that the province strong players will be smiling. Experience so far sees the province route player getting a quicker start in acquiring dice and early goods assisting with developments. The province specialist route seems clear with metallurgy (because you need something to build developments with), irrigation or aqueducts (because you can't always rely upon your opponents handing over food instead of tribute - especially profitable in a four player game), shipbuilding, navy and then Empire. Bonus points all over the place. Attack, attack, attack. What intrigues me is that I hear many people hold the opposite view, so that piques my interest in further exploration with different groups.

So all in all it's alright. A bit too much thought needs to be invested in the game's turn process to call it enjoyable. Perhaps a little balance issue. A little too much downtime for me. Dice luck, but there's some ways to mitigate the luck with developments, and I've always enjoyed the push your luck aspect of this and its predecessor. I'd just be more enthusiastic about the whole thing if turns played a little smoother. Nice ideas, but maybe a bit more development would have made it more enjoyable and varied.

Holy shit this game is dry. Whoever made this has no idea what makes rolling dice fun. 

Don't care what I roll (everything is pretty good), don't care what opponents roll (has nothing to do with me)... no tension. Blah.

And seriously what's with all the complexity? All the choices and tech lists and crap add little to the game but an ugly bastard list to match the rest of the ugly components. Their attempt at turning a dice game into a "real game" has a failed. Give me King of Tokyo any day.

Great new Roll Through the Ages installment, more involved than the original Bronze Age and perhaps even Late Bronze Age. This one plays quite differently, with a new source of points in "Tribute", earned by amassing armies and defeating invaders (the "Barbarians" disaster can be a good thing to get!) or engaging in conquest.

As in the previous games in the series, there is still significant luck (it's a dice game!) and the potential for painful downtime.

Yes, this game was a disappointment. [thing=37380][/thing] is a game I quite enjoy, and now the designer of recent favorite [thing=132531][/thing] had a go at making a variant of it. Sounds good right? But I feel exactly the same as BGG user ajax
[q] The added complexity did not increase the fun or engagement. It also lost much of the fun of the first game (the connected peg movement).[/q]
It just felt unstreamlined, a bit clunky. I don't feel like there's any reason to play this over the original one, that one plays better and is more fun. But I also have to be honost: this version is not bad, the otherones is just far superior.

Definitely an improvement over the previous game, but the luck of the dice is still frustrating. There are many turns where you know the exact "right" move that you need to make, and you might even have a really good backup move planned. But if you roll a lot of skulls or other things you don't need, you just can't make a good move. Then the person who does get lucky with the right rolls at the right time will win easily. I really like this game system, I just with it used a different mechanic than dice rolling.

Great game!  We will use the map expansion every time as well.  I'm surprised it wasn't included with the base game as I feel it is essential to truly differentiate this game from the original game.  It was amazing how Matt Leacock was able to make a civilization game without a map in the original game, but come on(!) you know you wanted one.  Tom Lehmann did a terrific job building on the original system. The balance between the map and new developments seems spot on.  There are many ways to victory to explore.  This game has everything I would want in a civilization game and plays in about an hour.  Wow!

Just played solitaire so far. Game allows multiple strategies and each seem to be winner strategies if played strongly and the dice favor that path to points. All in all feels like an improvement to the bronze age and I foresee this becoming a permanent addition to my collection. 
-After playing a 2p game I must say that there is a problem with downtime since there is nothing to do on an opponents turn. You can't even make grand plans as the dice will always force you to plan on the go. So this is a pure solo game for me.

This game fills a niche I don't have. It's a dice game with loads of icons and moving parts, but which is - at base - Yahtzee. If I want a complex game with dice, I own Troyes and Alien Frontiers. It doesn't have the charm of the original, especially because it no longer has the interlocking system of goods. 

I would always choose to play the original over this. Sold with few regrets.

Not a bad civilization-building game with element of luck via dice rolling. Feels like a WP/euro game where you get resources, use resources to buy buildings which give you advantages/points, and resolve the other effects of the dice. Like the element of war. For a four player game where 3 of the players were new and AP'ed, with the shorter victory condition, it took an hour to play, which is very decent.

What an impressive improvement on the original RttA!  Being able to "engine build" in different ways and use goods for many things really opens up the decision options.  Add on the feeling that tributes and some of the developments add new paths to victory and it just feels like there are a lot more meaningful decisions in this version.  I'll admit the battle phase ended up feeling a little clunky/fiddly but we were getting the hang of it by the end of our first game and I think it will come more naturally in the next one.

All and all a better game with the same basic feel of the original!  Though the four player game still is hampered by too much boring down time...

Good game, but I was hoping for something slightly different. What I like of the Bronze Age is its simplicity and I was hoping that this sequel was as linear and simple as the first one with some new mechanics that enhance the interaction between players. Instead, it seems to me that some aspects of the game are overly complicated, slowing down the gameplay. 
I would probably suggest the Bronze Age as light filler and this one if you want to have a more deep, but also more complex, experience.

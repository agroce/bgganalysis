Great kids game. A pretty good game for adults, too. If it gets too easy, just decrease the amount of time you have to complete each tower. Clearly best with 4. Still really good with 3. Way too simple with only 2.

A masterpiece and, IMHO, the moral winner of the kinder SdJ (I played Beppo der Bock and even if the idea is clever it is light years away from Burg Ritter).

In our game we even didn't manage to build any of the 3 towers; too busy to laugh

I'm planning to buy two copies, one for my nephew and one for me (ehm... of course in case she will make a visit at my home, right?... :-)

Players each take a string attached to a hair band, and work together to pick up and stack various blocks, working together to increase and decrease tension in the band in order to do so.

Not much interest for a group of adults, but an outstanding coop game to play with kids!  A lot of kids probably could care less about the rules, and just have fun building stuff with the building equipment.

Good cooperative dexterity game for kids - definitely promotes teamwork and helps with fine motor skills (yep, that would be a dexterity game...)  Fun for the kids, though the timer seems a bit short for them - we sometimes flip it twice as we're getting a hang of the game.  Nice chunky wooden pieces.

Difficile de noter un jeu à but principalement pédagogique. Les jeux qui ont pour but de transmettre des choses à nos bambins sont en effet dans la recherche d'un équilibre complexe entre apprentissage et jeu, et souvent la prépondérance de l'un se fait au détriment de l'autre.

Alors que noter ? Le fun de la chose et le plaisir pris par les enfants, ou le désir de transmission de l'auteur et le côté pédagogique du jeu ? Là est toute la subtilité de la chose, il faut savoir allier les deux. Des jeux qui visent à rendre la bataille plus facile, par exemple, sont très intéressants sur le plan pédagogique, mais les enfants s'ennuient vite et finalement le travail d'auteur est peu présent.

Avec "Les chevaliers de la tour", l'équilibre entre les deux composantes est trouvé. Sur le plan de l'apprentissage, le jeu travaille la coopération, le jouer ensemble, la motricité, l'observation (il faut reconnaître la situation), bref plein de choses qu'on travaille à cet âge là.

Mais le travail créatif est aussi présent, l'idée du mécanisme de coopération est fine et bien trouvée, le thème plaît aux joueurs, les cartes assez nombreuses pour éviter trop de répétition... même si les enfants n'y jouent pas des heures. Par contre, ils n'hésitent pas à le ressortir pour jouer quelques cartes. La version "standard" du jeu avec le sablier est dure pour les plus petits, on enlève donc l'enjeu et on est plus dans de l'entraînement qu'on peut complexifier par la suite.

Pour les adultes, on risque vite de s'ennuyer, mais on peut y jouer avec plaisir malgré tout, sans qu'on s'éternise dessus. Bref, un jeu pédagogique de très bonne facture qui a mérité ses prix, qui plaît aux enfants et que les enseignants peuvent intégrer dans leur apprentissage, sans que l'enjeu éducatif ne prenne le pas sur le plaisir de jouer.

interesting game, i like the tool they make you use to stack the blocks. 

This would make a very interesting variant for Villa Piletti! You would need to modify the rubber band for the smaller pieces, but would so worth it :)

Haven't played with kids yet, but with teenagers it works great.  This game elicited more screams of joy upon the success of building the tower than I've seen for a while.  It seems like it would be best for kids or adults playing with kids though.  After a few bungled attempts, the teenagers playing quickly figured it out.  Haba strikes again - a great idea for a game with first rate components - chock full of fun!

* Unique dexterity/cooperation children's game
* Great components, including a unique elastic tool with which to grab/place blocks
* Time element does make for a someone stressful endeavor for smaller gamers
* Elastic tool is a bit wonky, particularly considering it's the primary tool of the game
* Good as a test of dexterity, concentration and patience (for both adults AND kids)

RATING: 7
a great kid's game that requires cooperation.  However, since it is a physical task, you have to actually cooperate and not just do what somebody tells you to do.  The timer makes it challenging enough for adults.  With kids, you can just play without it.

Note:  my daughter at age 4 could understand the game, but couldn't pull the string hard enough to actually play.  She found it frustrating, since we couldn't actually get the square big enough to grip any of the pieces.  For that reason alone, it is probably better suited for kids a bit older.

In fact, the game would be batter if the elastic band were a bit more elastic.  That would make the act of picking up a piece more about precision and less about just pulling as hard as you hand.  Of course, even as is, the act of putting a piece onto the tower is still plenty hard and more than just strength.

Unique game that is truly cooperative. Not only is everybody working towards the same goal (as in most cooperative games), but everybody is working at the same time. This requires good communication, as players give and receive directions to try to build three towers. The timer is a little fast for my kids (about 45 seconds), but we substitute a longer timer for now.

RATING: 4
It takes a fair amount of dexterity to grab and move the blocks so it skews toward older toddlers/kids (6 years old?) but there is not a lot of actual game for a kid that age.

It works and it is beautiful as a Haba always is, but not worth the effort




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 1

Well this is a strange and silly children's game if I ever saw one. It's difficult to describe how the game works, so probably best if you just go check out this photograph: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/243611. Now that you've seen how it works, you know that it's a strange cooperative exercise of trying to quickly stack large wooden pieces without actually touching those pieces, except by means of a strange implement that requires all four players to cooperate in concert simultaneously. It requires finely tuned motor skills, so I can't imagine young children being able to manipulate the device. It was hard enough for adults to do it, especially given the time pressure. I know I had fun and was laughing during the game, so that's just about all you can really ask for with this type of game.

Rated as a game for my 4-year old.  He loves this, and it's been a hit with all of his friends.  Right now, it's more popular than Gulo Gulo, Pitchcar, or any number of quality Haba-ish kids games. Highly recommended as a natural cooperative for kids.

I find this game stimulating, especially due to the time constraint, but I know most other adults find it too easy. I like the need for teamwork and I think it would be more fun with four players instead of three. I'm not super good at this game and I find it finishes too fast for me to get into it, but I like it overall and always enjoy a play.

This is a fun collaborative game, which truly requires cooperation at high-speed.  Sloppy drops can make even experienced teams fail, and of course, an untrained, unskilled player can wreck it for everyone.

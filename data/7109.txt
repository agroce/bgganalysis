My very first game of the Central-Front-Series. Played several times and enjoyed it. Tried to keep up with the different serial-games and got them all! 
Even developed my own add-ons before North German Plain was published.

The Central Front Series are very good games that are fairly easy to play. The only problem I have with the system is there is basically only one scenario, that being a sneak attack on NATO by the WP. In the game some NATO units cannot even move until GT3 or so. I wish the system would have come with a NATO "not" surprised variant. Also, it is hard for NATO to counterattack in the game. The WP is in Regimants and NATO in Battalions. As long as you dont mind playing a defensive game as NATO you will like this series.

Part of the 'Central Front' series that covers a WW3 in the 1980's.  A unique system that uses friction points to reflect battlefield attrition and the strain on logistics in a modern battlefield environment.  I've played this by itself and linked with Hof Gap and BAOR.  Enjoyed each game and has good replay value.

Repurchased. Punched and complete. Super interesting artifact of the times before the legend of the M1 Abrams and Air/Land fever took over Cold War gaming. Actually very straightforward.  Losing the friction point mechanism later on in the series was a baffling error. I wonder why it has never been updated. The scale is perfect. There are lots of tough choices to make. Optimal play isn't obvious, either, especially once you start throwing nukes around. Still fresh after almost thirty years before my last playing.

Innovative friction point system. I played this several times with my brother. I still have fond memories of nuking a stack of his godless commie paratroopers as they were resting on a quiet, out of the way airfield. (They deserved it.)

Yet another game that could use a 2nd edition. (Decision?)

The "friction point" continuous movement/combat system worked well in this title to show the power of the Soviet operational/tactical echelon system.  NATO forces could incur a lot of "friction points" playing "bucket brigade" all over the map until they figured out how to conserve energy and pick and choose the right battles at the right time to disassemble the Soviet offensive.  The in this game and in this CENTRAL FRONT series is manifest in the variants made for it; most notably one where the Victory Games FLASHPOINT: GOLAN system is retrofitted to this title.

an excellent game, with the friction points playing a similar role to the fatigue counter in the GCACW. The NATO is on defense and don't have many occasion to attack but it is not a problem. The game is tensed and fun.

The best system I've come across for representing operational combat in the modern era.  Excellent physical production and intense situational complexity combine to make this a quality product.  Slow and demanding to play, making it a long, long game. Slightly revised rules.

The much discussed Friction Point system is a good design-for-effect approach to capturing the Soviet theory of echeloned attack with fought out units being replaced by fresh units every day or so.  The rules are clean and the map and pieces easily readable if not as elegant as those in the best recent games.  The game plays fast, about an hour a turn, so even the full campaign can be completed in a day.  The ability to combine the single-map games from this series into something bigger is nice.  Solitaire playablity is good except for the pre-plotted tactical nuclear bombardments.  Stay conventional and all is well.

In the end my rating reflects mostly the game system's ability to capture the logic of Soviet doctrine of the Cold War era.

My first "modern" wargame (well, it was modern at that time, anyway).  Although there were many flaws in the system, it was a very enjoyable game.  The rules changes in the later games in the series may have made it more realistic, but not as playable in my opinion.

RATING: 7
While this game gets some criticism for the friction point mechanism, I feel that it works well for modern combat in operational level games.  Although I like the map, counters, and scenarios, the rules were a bit of a mess, but the new Central Front rules available on CSW definitely help to clean things up a bit.  This is a game worth playing even now, as it is an interesting take on what could have been.

CENTRAL FRONT SERIES.

See comments on BAOR for system specific notes.

Interesting opening to the game - after the initial WP airstrike, NATO must hold back the initial Soviet divisions with the US 11ACR, a weak WG division, and a few territorial / reserve WG units as the US units on the map can't move or recover losses until GT4.  Can the screen hold until the US units release and another WG division moves up?  Chances are OK as terrain favors the defender here and the chances of NATO airpower showing up early are better than BAOR.  NATO counterattack chances are better than BAOR also as US / WG units a slightly stronger, but overall this game is about a NATO defense and a WP attack & race against time.

RATING: 5
Interesting attempt to model the NATO Central Front at batallion level, let down by flaws in the scaling. By making Soviet units regiment-sized, NATO counterattacks were near-impossible, so the game favoured the 'Russian juggernaut' view of the 3-4 km battlefield. In play the US is progressively overrun until Reforger reinforcements could arrive.

An interesting and playable treatment of hypothetical modern warfare in central Europe. Unique game system allows you to move and attack repeatedly in a single turn, at the cost of increasing disruption of the involved units. This recreates the fluidity of the modern mechanized battlefield, and aptly illustrates the need to withdraw heavily-engaged units back to safe areas for rest & refit. This can be combined with other "Central Front Series" games such as "Hof Gap" to form large monster games of various sizes. A very immersive game system to play; one of SPI's better efforts.

Fifth Corps: The Soviet Breakthrough at Fulda is one of several games in the Central Front Series published by SPI.  Both the game and series depict the early days of World War III in West Germany. Combat is conducted at the company, battalion, and regiment level, with a map scale of 4 km per hex. The map covers the Fulda Gap and includes the major West German cities of Frankfurt and Mainz.

One of the first games I purchased back in Junior high; I was toally blown away by it. Took me forever to learn but I played it many times, scenarios and then the big campaign. nothing more fun than standing strong on the autobahn with those little 11th ACR 1-2 units holding back an enitre Soviet division in march formation.

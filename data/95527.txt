RATING: N/A
Initial first impression is it's deeper rather than wider. I seemed to be long chaining a lot of stuff together and some actions just made no sense in why someone would do them (the ROI just wasn't there). The pirate tokens feel like a poor man's Le Havre loans; you can get rid of them, but almost everyone ends up taking them which is an annoyance. I do like how you select your dice at the start and then start doing actions (and having to crawl under certain numbers to use them), and the linking of favor tokens is an interesting piece. The "extra actions" piece of the selection seems really amorphous outside of "get lots of food." I bet a lot of this stuff reveals itself over multiple plays, I'm just not sure I want to invest the time and energy to do so with a game design that I tend to dislike (complex wide vs complex deep argument).

RATING: 7
After a few plays and some analysis it feels like some of the layers are just fluff that rarely matters. I found the game reduced a little too quickly, particularly for the rules investment required. There are some nice ideas on display here but rather too many mechanics for what the game offers.

edit: for a game I wrote off I sure am itching to play this again...

Demasiado recargado de mecánicas, e influye bastante suerte de dados, recuerda al vinhos y que tiene así diferentes tipos de mecánicas entremezcladas y es largo. Le dan un 10 en la spielbox??? Va... en serio? Es un buen euro, pero se puede conseguir la misma o más profundidad con mecánicas más sencillas y elegantes.

RATING: 6.5
*Rating based on one play.

A decent game, but too long and complex for my tastes.  It's not a hard game to learn, there is just a lot to learn and remember.  Most of the rules are intuitive and so can be understood and remembered without too much difficulty, but there are a few that were sticking points (wood collection comes to mind).  The artwork and components are well done (though why is the 3-value money bronze colored and the 1-value money silver, and not the other way around?).  The iconography is mostly decipherable and serves well as reminders of the rules.

Overall, the game gave me the feeling of a longer, more complicated Castles of Burgundy (a game I love), but that is not an improvement in my mind.  The game was fun and would have earned a higher score (maybe a 7-7.5) if I could imagine playing it with 4 in under 2 hours.  However, that factor of length weighs the game down as I don't expect to get the game back to the table much (if ever).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Wow, wow, wow!  Absolutely great game.  Relatively easy to grasp rules and mechanics, but which also interact to provide a rich, complex, and rewarding experience, particularly in the later game when players must score multiple Crown Requests in a single round.  The introduction of the Pirate Dice and the ability to, ahem, fail to pay all of one's financial obligations also makes for very interesting play, particularly in later rounds when players are trying to ensure that they don't end up with the most pirate tokens (accumulated over the game for ripping people off).  

The game has a perceived game weight that is much higher than its actual game weight, I think.  I think this game is a fairly natural progression for those already playing games like Agricola, Le Havre, Terra Mystica, etc.  The problem, of course, is getting it to the table with people who haven't already played all of the games that serve as "building blocks."

I'm sure glad it plays well as a 2-player so my wife and I get to play it.  It has been hard to find another solid couple that we could introduce this one to, mainly because we don't have many serious gamers among our close friends (at least among our close friends in close proximity).

This is on the too-heavy side for me.  Lots of neat interlocking mechanics, but it has a steep learning curve.  I didn't start to get the swing of it until after the 2nd of 5 rounds.  I'm sure others will like it, but it's a meatier Euro.

Another game from Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro and Paulo Soledade, in fact it is their first. And, from the 3 games I've played from them so far, their best and their heaviest. Very impressive heavy euro with the mechanics matching the theme very much. There are lots of things going on every round and you simply have to make the best choices on your way to provide the Court's requests. Loved it.

Absolutely need to play this one again, consider an 8 a provisional rating based on the crunchiness that was extremely evident after one play. I always pick up games very quickly but this one definitely took me a couple of turns to fully grok. Even then there is just quite a lot you need to hold in your mind at once, until the end game which whittles itself down to some fine decisions. Want to play again soon.

Extremely annoying game. It's hard to do the actions you want in a round without taking pirate tokens which then require actions to get rid of. Your cost for actions is determined by rolling dice AFTER you've taken the action - ridiculous! Lots of piddly rules. Too many steps to go through a round. Iconography isn't much help. Madeira will drive you to drink!

RATING: 7
Ένα eurogame αφιερωμένο στα νησιά Μαδέιρα, νοτιοδυτικά της Πορτογαλίας, μέσα στον Ατλαντικό ωκεανό. Έπαιξε σημαντικό ρόλο σαν πρώτος σταθμός των Πορτογαλικών αποστολών κατά την διάρκεια των εξερευνήσων. Άφθονη ξυλεία για ναυπήγηση πλοίων και γόνιμο έδαφος για καλλιέργεια σιτηρών. Υπήρξε αποικία πρότυπο των Πορτογάλων καθώς εκεί δοκίμασαν τις πρώτες πειραματικές φυτείες μπαχαρικών και ζάχαρης. Σήμερα είναι μια αυτόνομη περιοχή γνωστή για σαν τουριστικό θέρετρο αλλά και για τα υπέροχα κρασιά της. :cool:

Πάμε στο παιχνίδι τώρα. Ο κάθε παίκτης έχει τους εργάτες τους και τους τοποθετεί σε διάφορες περιοχές του νησιού ώστε να παράγει προϊόντα. Επίσης φτιάχνεις πλοία με τα οποία μπορείς να πουλήσεις τα αγαθά σου για χρήματα ή μπορείς να τα στείλεις να βοηθήσουν σε άλλες Πορτογαλικές αποικίες ανά την υφήλιο για να πάρεις δωράκια από τον Βασιλιά. 

Παράλληλα βοηθάμε στο χτίσιμο των 3 σημαντικών πόλεων του νησιού, στην φύλαξη του νησιού από πειρατές ενώ υπάρχουν και 4 ομάδες/guilds (ευγενείς, έμποροι, εκκλησία, στρατιωτικοί) που μπορούν να μας βοηθήσουν με διάφορους τρόπους. Ανά 2 γύρες περίπου πρέπει να φέρουμε σε πέρας και τις αποστολές που μας αναθέτει ο βασιλιάς. Φυσικά πρέπει να ταΐζουμε τους εργάτες μας και να συντηρούμε τα πλοία μας κάθε γύρα. Γενικά έχει ψωμί το παιχνίδι και έχει και αρκετούς κανόνες για εξήγηση. Υπομονή. :snore:

Το ταμπλό είναι γεμάτο πληροφορίες ενώ βρίσκω τα γραφικά του όμορφα, στο σύνηθες στυλ της What’s Your Game. Ο βασικός μηχανισμός είναι worker placement με ζάρια. Η σημαντικότερη απόφαση είναι αυτή που παίρνεις στην αρχή κάθε γύρου. Ρίχνουμε όλα τα ζάρια σε ομάδες των τριών και πρέπει με την σειρά να αποφασίσει ο καθένας ποια ομάδα ζαριών θέλει. Η κάθε ομάδα όμως πάει πακέτο με συγκεκριμένη θέση στο turn order της γύρας, με βοήθεια από συγκεκριμένο guild και με αποστολές του Βασιλιά.
 
Κανονικά κάνεις 3 action τη γύρα αλλά άμα θέλεις μπορείς να χρησιμοποιήσεις και πειρατικά ζάρια για έχτρα κινήσεις. Προσοχή όμως γιατί στο τέλος υπάρχει πρόστιμο σε VP για αυτούς που το παρακάνουν σε πειρατές. Κάθε διαθέσιμο action πάει πακέτο με ένα κτήριο που προσφέρει δωράκια άμα πληρώσεις το ανάλογο κόστος. 

Αφού έχει ζάρια, πόσο luck-based είναι?? :what: Μμμμ, τα ζάρια έχουν τιμές 1-3 και δεν νομίζω πως παίζουν και πολύ ρόλο στο ποια action μπορείς να κάνεις. Άλλωστε με λίγο ψωμί μπορείς να μεγαλώσεις το ζάρι σου. Από την άλλη τα ζάρια καθορίζουν και τις τιμές για την χρησιμοποίηση των κτηρίων και εκεί υπήρχαν κάποιες διακυμάνσεις.  

Γενικά πολύ γεμάτο medium heavy euro, ένα play δεν είναι αρκετό για να βγάλω συμπεράσματα. Δείχνει να είναι καλό αλλά το ζάρι ίσως παίζει λίγο μεγαλύτερο ρόλο από ότι θα ήθελα για ένα παιχνίδι αυτού του βάρους και διάρκειας. Θέλω να το ξαναπαίξω.

RATING: 8
Madeira, in my estimation, is an interesting mixed bag, hard for me to fully love, but also hard not to admire and respect, and for the advanced euro gamer in me, enjoy playing with.  

On the plus side, the art is very good, the components are top notch, and for fans of innovative game design in general, a number of the mechanics in the game feel fresh and fun to play around with.  

Noteworthy interesting mechanics include: "action placements" using previously selected dice groups, as well as pirate action placement dice of variable power and limited availability; "secondary action" availability dependent up the initial action placements, somewhat randomized costs, and spatial board worker placements; subtle incentives for choosing actions that others have chosen and disincentives to go it alone; turn order rewards featuring decent binary decisions; individualized victory point "goal requirements" which must be met in the first, third and fifth rounds, with some flexibility to select among a player's group of goals in the third and fifth rounds; punishment counters that accrue to players when they are unable or unwilling to meet some of the resource requirements of the game, such as bread to feed their workers, money to pay for secondary actions, or wood to pay for ship upkeep; the ability to discard punishment counters through various means in the game, but remarkably severe (and questionable) end-game VP losses for those players possessing the most and second most punishment tokens at the end of the game; variable shipping scoring dependent upon spatial placement and round chosen for scoring; special bonus actions through guild chits which can be tapped and untapped through various means; and interlocking the many and varied mechanisms such that they interact with each other in indirect and direct ways.

On the minus side, Madeira feels noticeably fiddly when played, is difficult to teach, is unlikely to produce an enjoyable first game for a great many euro gamers, and perhaps due to the many, admirable complex interlocking mechanics, manages to create a feeling of distance from its actual theme, which is a style of game design that might perhaps be described as Feldian.  Interesting mechanics here definitely trump theme, and in some ways, bury the theme.  What are we doing here again?  Complicated resource acquisitions and conversions to what end?

As such, in my estimation, Madeira probably deserves a 7.  Nevertheless, out of sheer respect for the many fresh, interesting and interlocking mechanics, I feel like the rating has to be bumped up to an 8.  This is a game designed for euro gamers who want to play a challenging, very heavy euro game, and Madeira essentially meets its design goals well.

Heavy dice worker placement game that is tight on resources and brutally unforgiving. Once you get a handle on how to deal with the resources and various actions it becomes a little easier to manage, but the game will still find a way to punch you in the gut a few times. Very enjoyable game.

RATING: 8.3
On the heavier side of the games I currently possess, but not so much because it's 'difficult'. No, the density of this game comes in all the interactions on the board, and the nuances of detail, and the constant trading you'll be doing for bread, wood, prestige points, and currency. The dice add a slight element of randomness which is then mitigated, and there's definitely a punishing 'feed your people' type upkeep, for both workers and ships, which can get you weighed down with Pirates that affect your PP later on in. Lots to think about, the various round effects offer immediate strategic goals, but it's an impressive, solid game with some historic value.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
A complex, but very rewarding game. It gets (almost) everything right: interesting and fun actions giving you tough choices to make but never annoying ones since they are quite elegant. Lots of strong player interaction due to a unusual way of play order that not just changes a lot but also has different effects in each phase of a game round. 
Lots of ways balanced ways to score points and no way to get "stuck" anywhere.

And it even looks great! (if I had to say something negative, it's that while the theme is not the usual "build your town/country/company", it has still the same medieval/renaissance vibe. Give me spaceships or fantasy creatures! ;))

RATING: 8
It has a very cool twist on worker placement that gives you 2 things for each worker.  The only issue is how long it is.  I enjoy it a lot, but don't feel like playing it very often.  It's probably the heaviest game i have played.  I literally feel exhausted after a game because of how much thinking i put into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.6
First impressions of this game aren't that good. Yes, the artwork is beautiful, but iconography could be clearer, and game components aren't the best (I _really_ noticed the vast difference between how hard it was to punch this cleanly, and how effortless and smooth the punching for Isle of Skye was). Going through the rulebook is a struggle the first time, and you really need a second run-through to get a good feel for the game.

Once you're playing, though, wow, what a game! Very heavy and brainburny, with all actions having multiple consequences, and timing being everything. Every 'bad' action has a mitigating factor making it possibly better. There's multiple ways to do everything you'd want to do, but also high chances of those things being blocked by other players.

An absolute slog to play for the first time - soooo long. But totally worth it. I hope I'll get to play this quite a lot with people who also enjoy it, to together get good at it. Plays surprisingly well with 2 players (even if 3 seems the sweet spot), and it did speed up nicely now that we know what we're doing.

Proposed Maderia for gaming tonight as it had been given a 10 by Spielbox.  First play, very impressed.  Explanation took an hour and the game the evening.  But very absorbing.  All the restrictions, dice included, did not feel too intrusive.   All decisions interesting and more than one dimensional.  Only area of design that seemed a step too far was need to change production types in turns 2 and 4.  Also my preference would have been for four rounds, as game was aboiut to, but didn't quite. outstay its welcome. Mariano Iannelli's graphics first class as always with WYG.  Only quibble is production of tiles which were difficult to pop as many printed next to each other, not invidually (to save space I suspect).   Great to see WYG back on tracxk after the poor Asgard and ober complicated Vinhos.  Maderia is up there with Vasco de Gama, perhaps even better.  Many congratulations to Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro and Paulo Soledade for an excellent first design.   Looking foirward to further plays.

I don't mind heavy games, but this one is rules-heavy. It took me almost an hour to explain the game, with all guild favors and all of that. Then we played for 3 hours a 3-hour game. Since we play various games, we won't remember the rules that well if we ever played it for the second time, so I know it would take much time to re-explain it once. It just takes too much time, I'd rather play something heavier (Agricola?) and lighter in that time. On top of that rules are so convoluted, there are too many things to constantly remember about (e.g. wood acquisition), they eventually start making sense, but it's a struggle before you get there. With that said I enjoyed the game to a certain degree, but rarely will I find enough time to play this game. There are way more games of this caliber that take an hour less.  I'd embrace a second, streamlined edition though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Well it is almost impossible to judge this game properly with 1 play. It seems that the ratio between the increased complexity compared and the depth/gameplay potential it provides, falls just below my personal limit. I mean, this game seems overloaded with mechanics, even for heavy games fans like me. None of the mechanics seems clearly excessive, but after a point one wonders if they make the game better than it would be with 1-2 mechanics less.

What would happen if it had 1-2 mechanics less? well then the game is great! it is well designed, unique in its strategy. Would I play it again though? perhaps I would give it another chance, but consider that I am a fan of heavy games (mage knight, le havre etc) and I was not ecstatic with this one.

Madeira shares more than some characteristic with Vinhos: both are heavy economic games, designed by debutant portuguese authors, illustrated by the same artist, published by the same publisher.
The similarities stop there, however. Madeira feels a little more streamlined, with just some nice thematic touches here and there: the depleting wood resources, the changes in fields production and the way colonies and markets are designed owe to the history of the island.

The game is quite heavy and demanding, with many intertwined mechanics and decisions. Perhaps just a little too much for such a game, so it needs a long explanation before first games.

I tried it with just two players, and it felt heavy but a little underwhelming in the possibilities to specialize and differentiate: with room for just two dice on each character, and with half of the crown requests, there is not much room to diverge. Anyway, tentative rating is a solid 7.5, and it could well rise if the 3 and 4 players game can deliver what it promises...

Out of Print (OOP).

One of the most interesting finds for me. Was initially apprehensive because it was suppose to be a heavy euro game. However, I found the game to be super enjoyable. There are many options as to what you can do so you are not stuck with limited options.

Definitely a keeper and likely to see more plays going forward. A shame that this is for 4 players only.

Madeira plays very smoothly despite all the interlocking mechanisms; something I'm missing in most of the Feld designs. Every decision you make has several effects: Pirate dice give you an extra action - but only play them where they throw some sand into your opponents plans but not yours. Where do you want to get resources from without missing out on increasing your chance to do well with your chosen VP condition. Don't be too obvious about your VP condition or your opponents will make you miss out big time. Pass early to get a great benefit or better to become first player next turn?... 
The playing time though keeps it collecting dust for most of the time.

RATING: 7
First play: I had been put off of this by the dice mechanic back in 2013 but like minded gamers to myself reassured me that the dice were manageable and not a random luckfest. With these endorsements in mind I was persuaded to play.

In short it is a very deep and complex game. The explanation took 45 minutes and the options made me dizzy. I like that in a game. The flow is clever and well balanced, however my reservations about the dice were correct. On the one turn I had last position, 3 ones were rolled. I was forced to use all of my bread to achieve reasonable actions. Furthermore the rolls to assess the influence of pirates vs the cost to take an action was IMHO very clumsy and random. Sure collect enough money and it doesn't matter but the swing of these lotteries did make a difference. 

Finally the sting of -16 vps for most pirate tokens is a massive kick and in our game the player who had just one token suffered -8vp. 

Overall I felt what could have been a monumentally clever and balanced game was ruined by two crude dice mechanisms that introduce massive randomness and a sucker punch penalty at game end. A rating of 7 for the production and clever bits but a game I wouldn't want to buy or play again.

A phenomenal, if traditional, Euro.  Pretty heavy rules complexity but it supports tight, interlocking mechanisms with a lot of puzzle pieces you need to balance.  It doesn't see enough play but I love it when it does.

RATING: 9
Pro's:

1) I have to say that for a heavy euro the game feels surprisingly thematic. A lot of your actions really make sense for what you are trying to do and achieve and the actions you can perform.
2) The ways the actions on the board interact with another is fantastic, all the pieces balance and flow. It feels very rewarding when you complete something as the game makes it clear that it is impossible to do everything.
3) The game IS quite thinky, but at the same time it separates every element in a way that makes every individual component relatively easy to digest, the true mastering then comes from combining these elements together.

Con's:

1) The first play through was kind of a slog, the game doesn't really do a whole lot to make it easier for you either.
2) There really needs to be more resource chits.


Side Note:

You have to enjoy a certain level of punishing masochism as the game is designed to make you feel like you are terrible at everything.

A lot is going on the board. 
Although you have 5 main ways to get Prestige Points (the scoring tiles), the way you achive them and how you do with it is what makes this game special.

Being mainly a wargamer, this euro has got a special place in my heart. 

The options you have, how you use the dice, the pirates... great and complex game.

The designers are my friends, but I my rate is not influenced by this.

Eurogames like this one, Brass, Imperial and Tigris are great choices and I'm always willing to play them, despite they are really diferent games.

It's as heavy as heavy goes. Reading the rules for the first time can give you a headache but after a second play it gets easier and although it is heavy euro it can play really smoothly. And it's really good! It's consistent and fun. I would love to try other What's Your Game games. It might be to long and heavy for me to keep. Although it would be a shame ;)

A bit of a super-euro. A genuinely fun set of mechanisms that provide a very good level of player interaction and a deep thinky strategy experience. It may take many plays to naturally intuit the best chain of moves and blocks, but like the wine, I feel this is delicious and will easily stand the test of time. Instant classic.

2 Player game is very deep. Go to the city, produce maximum wood you can, bake breads, buy guild members, sail to the colonies or trade your goods away for a full bag of coins. Better than i thought. Every decision offers you two more options. The pirate counters, we recieved are no match at long term, but costs you a few victory points on your way to victory. The game moves at the small frontier, where gaming gets to working, but stays luckily on the right side. I´m now excited, how a 4 player Madeira flows.
EDIT: Works well with 3 co-players.

2012 Interest: Low.  With next to no information on this, it's hard to say; however, I am a sucker for dice used in innovative ways.  That said, the meat of the game will have to end up being much more interesting then typical resource collection game for me to try this out.

2013: Have now gotten to read the rules.  Looks like a typical resource conversion/engine building type game.  It looks like there's a lot going on and it does bring to mind Vasco da Gama so I am curious to hear what people think after they've tried it.  However, there are no definite plans for U.S. distribution so it looks unlikely that I'll get it if I don't preorder (~$50 including shipping).

Both of my parents were born and raised on Madeira island. A few years ago my mother told me there was a board game about Madeira.

This piqued my interest so I decided to order it and unbeknownst to me at the time that this purchase would send me down the rabbit hole of enjoying heavy Euro games. 

I was specifically seeking out Portuguese designed board games and now have Madeira, Vinhos, CO2 and Panamax in my collection.

Madeira is a deeply intricate game with different ways of attaining your objectives. It is very satisfying when your strategy comes to fruition but still very challenging when money, resources and bread are almost always tight making you decide what is the optimal move.

I just wanted to say thanks to the designers for making me discover how satisfying these board games can be to play!

Muito Obrigado!

6/27/14 - latest by What's Your Game? - I like their other games, so.....

This one takes a bit to digest and requires foresight to maximize your minimums. First game was 2er, and the score was 99 to 98. I made a decision in the 3rd round of the game which swung 5 points in my direction - if I hadn't of made that move at that point I would have lost the game by 4 points. The decisions you make earlier in the game could have far reaching consequences towards victory or defeat. Larger decision making tree in this game than your standard Euro. Much to like and explore here.

A very strange, very heavy game with a  convoluted and unintuitive set of rules which will probably turn a lot of people off. I read the rulebook twice, my husband also read it, I watched two video reviews and yet we STILL played it wrong on our first game.

The problem is that the rules are often inconsistent, and each part of the board might have a different set of rules depending on the phase of the game. For example, the mayor allows you to rearrange workers in cities, gaining resources from them, but using a build action to place workers in the cities does not allow you to do take the resources. The dice you use for actions are rerolled to determine building costs, but not the pirate dice, which are instead rerolled to determine the number of pirates you take if you cannot pay (plus one!). Having majorities in cities are important for scoring, but majorities don't matter in the market/colony zones. And don't even get me started on the wood. Good God, the wood.

With that said, once you have the rules down, it's a good game. It's long, it's a little tedious, but it is also challenging and rewarding, with lots of painful decisions to make, and a million things to keep track of: feeding workers, maintaining ships, paying for actions, getting majorities, and timing your scoring tiles, all in addition to actually playing the game (harvesting fields, selling goods, getting colonies, etc.). Add in the bonus actions and the guild powers, and suddenly the number of possibilities becomes dizzying. Not for the casual gamer.

Holy cow, is there a lot going on in this one, but it all comes together very nicely.  It'll definitely take you a while for everything to come together, but it's good stuff once it does.

Most of your actions in this game have more than one impact, so there's a lot of balancing your current needs with future stuff in mind. Every placement will not only give you an immediate reward, but also be part of some engine where you'll also reap future rewards, so you need to cash in on both whenever possible.

Overall, a good game on the fairly heavy end of the spectrum.

I have a feeling that people are going to think a lot of this game just based on how complex it is.  We had a 1+ hour rules explanation before a 150 minute 3-player game. But the fact is that the game really has some problems from a mechanistic standpoint. It has some clever things included but they don't save the game from muddle.  First, there isn't an engine...the game is an economic one, don't get me wrong, but there are few ways to get in-game points. Not terrible by itself, but when you consider that you score 90% of your points from open goal tiles that you draft based on turn order, it is a problem. Thus, there really isn't a breadth of strategic paths through the game. Also, you have a good idea who is winning since so many of their points are open and waiting to be scored (in my game, I didn't want to play the last 2 rounds because, aside from bad play, there was no way to catch the leader). 

Second, the game places too much emphasis on its less favorable attributes.  The Cities area is a tactical mess, and doesn't amount to all that much. There are many ways to affect this area control portion of the game, but it only affects certain goal tiles for points. You can use it for resources but there is only a single character action to make use of it. The neatest part of the game, the city watch vs. pirate actions/tokens is the least utilized in the game's mechanics!  

Finally, I just don't think the harvesting to simply pay for ships and people who are harvesting is really all that compelling. If you start the game with the 3 ships in colonies crown request tile, you have to spend everything you have to complete this at turn 1 (everybody else is going to score theirs fully, naturally).  Then you will have to pay 3 wood every round for the course of the game...count how many wood tokens you have access to at game start and how much money you have left...it isn't practical and there is no way to trim your expenditures since you can't pull ships and workers back to your supply. I like how the game gives you tips in the rulebook, including how not to place your ships too early...you mean those things I need to score victory points and keep up?

I think this game could work, but some things would have to be changed. I think it needs to be easier to get people in the city watch.  Shipping goods should get you money and victory points to reward a harvest heavy strategy (one in which your turn-by-turn costs are high) that can counteract the domination of guild favors. Finally, there either needs to be more crown's request tiles that are worth less points, or a different way to acquire them that keeps them closed scoring.

I think Madeira is a pretty good eurogame with a lot of different mechanics (like Rococo, but much heavier). There are a ton of ways to score points which is cool. Maybe it is slightly too long for what it is; if I am going to spend more than 2 hours on a game, it better be very good or rewarding, and perhaps I think that there is missing that “something” in Maderia, although it’s certainly not an easy or non-complex game. There is certainly a fair bit of luck, but it’s not too bad. However you need to know that the city tiles are shuffled each round and can have an impact on where they show up. Furthermore the dice each round has an impact, especially if you’re picking dice as the last player. Furthermore there are the pirate dice which are also random, but I do have to admit that the die rolls didn’t seem too game-changing. 

The pirate tokens were a cool idea as you need to balance the instant bonus you get for getting an extra die with the negative points you get at the end (and if you have a good memory, you will have an advantage as it’s important to remember how many tokens the other players have as the penalty is significant).

Furthermore the ships/workers cost more in upkeep the more you have, so there’s always a delicate balance between “risk” and reward. Finally I like how the passing is an important aspect in the game as it decides which bonus you get and when you get to choose your next actions and such.
I thought about buying it, but having thought a little more about it the game is probably only a 7.5, which is not good enough to warrant a spot on my limited shelf space.

[thing=95527][/thing] has more meat on it than an all you can eat Texas roadside BBQ! 

Mechanically the game is very simple. At the beginning of each phase [b]dice[/b] are rolled. In turn order each player chooses a set of dice that they will place ([b]worker placement[/b]) throughout their turn to gain various benefits either from different characters or buildings within Madeira. The decision tree as to why you would want to choose one over the other is extremely intricate and presents many opportunities and strategic paths to victory.  

The winner will be the person who gains the most prestige with the Crown of Portugal by adapting him or herself to their whims by successfully fulfilling various requests from them and by remaining flexible to the changing farming conditions. 

This is a BBQ worth skipping breakfast for!

Strategic dice placement game, with several interconnected systems that work together rather well. Forward planning is a constant necessity, not just ifor the current round, but even further. This is a tight game, having in principle only 15 actions for the whole game. In addition to those, the "pirate dice" mechanism, albeit thematically weak, allows players lots of freedom to open up their game. Quite innovative and ingenious, it gives quirkiness and character to the game. If you like resource optimization and planning puzzles, this is one of the best of its ilk. 

+ Balanced, tight, well thought out, with lots of well interconnected systems
+ The pirate dice mechanism rocks
+ Decision heavy, as much tactical as strategic
+ Reasonably straightforward gameplay, once the iconography and special actions are digested
+ The every-other-turn scoring gives the game an interesting cadence
+ Great components and art, as usual for WYG and Mariano Ianelli

= Lots of forward planning needed, you always need to optimize your resources
= There is a lot going on, perhaps a bit too much

- The 4 personalities on 5 spaces placement feels a bit contrived

Long, intense and a large number of mechanics put into one game (we didn't finish the whole thing as it was going to take too long). Prone to massive AP. If I was to play this I wouldn't play with any more than 3 players and preferably with people who already knew the game. Otherwise I would expect you would be committing to a 5+ hour event. This game simply isn't worth that time investment. Just another variation on all the various euro mechanics. I would consider this to be a heavy euro.

Update: Bumping to 9. Game of the year.

Let's be frank; this is a kitchen sink game. But what a lovely sink it is! What it's NOT is a VP salad. You do get vps in a variety of ways, but you're choosing goals (all players at the same time) and completing goals (all players at the same time), so all players have their own directions they're working toward, which often results in some bumping into each other, but not much direct conflict, other than snatching something before someone else gets it. I don't normally mention a beautiful board, but seriously, this is a beautiful board. Not just in form, but also in function. The board has numerous nice iconographic reminders of the many things going on.

There is a fair bit of randomness, but it's not generally huge swing stuff, and there are ways to mitigate, both in advance and in the moment. There is also a random setup, which I quite like. The randomness during the game is minimal, i.e. things that might cost you a few more bucks here or there, but typically nothing derailing.

There are plenty of things to get distracted by. You definitely have to focus on what your actual goals are, rather than what looks like a good deal or appealing.

It's a long game, but most importantly, to us at least it didn't [i]feel[/i] like a long game. I suspect that it will be ~2hr on subsequent plays.

I do think that this is strictly a 4 player game. You need the increased competition on favors, and specifically on reactivating them. The game feels a little soft with 3 players how two of the guilds get reactivated on two different turn order slots, rather than 1 each in 4p. Also 4p has a bit wider distribution of building action costs, which I like.

Madeira represents a class of game I do not like (anymore). At the core it is a game of obtaining a few resources, and convert these to VP. Dudes on a map produce the resources and need feeding at regular intervals; other dudes convert the produced goods yielding VP and bonus stuff, and so it goes. The designers of Madeira decided that the way to go about doing this was creating long and twisty roads full of little details and hurdles and then some. Resulting in an opaque mess full of little knobs and switches and dials whose sole raison d'être seems to be to be there and make the conversion road even more arduous and multiplexed. Truly: 'having lots of options' does not automatically mean 'this game has interesting depth'. If a game has many options, players shouldn't be burdened with long, detailed rules and cross-cutting mechanisms.

I find it curious to reflect on what Madeira's authors themselves consider good and bad titles. There is quite a bit of overlap with my own preferences; there are differences too. But none help me understand why and how they came up with this monstrosity. Perhaps the entire thing had a momentum of its own once it started to 'work', I dunno. Sorry guys: really, if I'm ever in Portugal I'm happy to duke it out over a good match of Liberté (on which we all agree that it is a great game), but this ... 'love child' of yours is way too rich for my tastes :meeple:.

Enjoyable heavy game, with a plethora of interesting options available, but the pirates are a little too punitive IMHO. 1 pirate token can cost you as many 8-16 vps, which is very heavy handed. I would prefer to see a variant that scales the punishment to the number of players that are in scope.

This is such a wonderful game that its rating could go sky high, if it wasn´t for the difficulty for start playing it.
The game is not really complex and even seems very logical and direct, once you get the hang of it, the question is that there are so many options, so many things to do and so many ways to reach objectifs, that new players get frighten just for looking the set up and experienced players may face serious AP problems trying to find the "correct" path to score maximum number of points.
Some nice features are the possibility to score some objectifs and keep others in store to score later in the game, and also the possibility (or the need) to program one´s play to the scoring that will take place much later.  
The feeling you get when playing "Madeira" is that every mechanic and every aspect of the game was carefully thought to accomplish an almost perfect product.
I think every immersive and challenging game has always some degree of complexity, it comes with the package, there´s no way to avoid it...

Madeira is een expert-spel. Het spel duurt vijf rondes, en elke ronde heeft vijf fasen.

In fase A wordt in speelvolgorde volgens de paslijst een set van drie blauw-groene dobbelstenen gekozen waarmee in fase B gespeeld gaat worden. De gekozen rij dobbelstenen bepaalt tevens de beurtvolgorde in fase B, welke privileges eventueel omgedraaid mogen worden en welke scoretegel je mag kiezen.

In fase B plaats je volgens de nieuwe speelvolgorde een dobbelsteen in 1 van de 3 regio's of de bosregio. De waarde van de dobbelsteen (1, 2 of 3) bepaalt in welke regio je mag inzetten. Tegen betaling van 1 of 2 brood mag je ook dobbelstenen met een lagere waarde in een hogere regio plaatsen. Je plaatst een eigen actieschijf met de gekozen dobbelsteen op 1 van de 5 beschikbare actievelden en voert de bijbehordende actie uit, of je gaat oogsten in die regio. Op 4 van de 5 plaatsen liggen elke ronde losse "personen" die je helpen bij je actie. Na elke ronde worden deze kaarten geschud en opnieuw geplaatst, daarbij elke ronde een ander veld openlatend. Op het opengelaten veld kan alleen geoogst worden. Je mag er ook voor kiezen 1 van de 3 zwarte piratendobbelstenen in te zetten. In dat geval zet je geen eigen actieschijf in. Om een piratendobbelsteen in te mogen zetten moet je minstens 1 werker als wacher in de toren hebben staan. Na het nemen van de dobbelsteen haal je 1 werker uit de toren. Als je wilt passen zet je je passchijfje op 1 van de 4 pasvelden en je kiest voor respectievelijk geld of de extra actie die bij dat pasveld hoort. Je gekozen positie bepaalt de beurtvolgorde voor de rest van de ronde en fase A van de volgende ronde.

In fase C worden de dobbelstenen die op een actieveld liggen opnieuw gerold en dat bepaalt de prijs die spelers moeten betalen die er in fase B een eigen actieschijf hebben gezet. Als spelers betalen mogen ze de bijbehorende gebouwenactie uitvoeren, afhankelijk van hoeveel werkers er in de betreffende regio staan. Spelers mogen er ook voor kiezen om niet te betalen, en dan ontvangen ze piratenschijfjes gelijk aan 1+ de waarde van de eventueel aanwezige piratendobbelsteen, dus miniaal 1 en maximaal 4.

In fase D krijgt de speler met de meeste werkers in de toren 4 prestigepunten als hij er voor kiest om 1 wachter terug in z'n voorraad te nemen. Werkers in koloniën leveren wijn, graan of suiker. Voor elk schip van de speler moet 1 hout worden betaald aan onderhoud. Voor elk hout dat een speler niet wil of kan betalen neemt hij 1 piratenschijfje. Tot slot worden alle werkers gevoed; 1 brood per werker. De spelers hebben eventueel al wat brood-tegoed in de molen, welk niet ingeleverd hoeft te worden. Ook hier geldt; voor elk brood dat een speler niet wil of kan betalen neemt hij 1 piratenschijfje.

In fase E wordt in ronde I 1 van de 2 opdrachten vervuld, in ronde II worden alle daarvoor in aanmerking komende lege graanvelden geconverteerd naar suikervelden, in ronde III worden 2 van de 3 opdrachten vervuld, in ronde IV worden alle lege daarvoor in aanmerking komende suikervelden geconverteerd naar wijnvelden, en in ronde V worden alle 3 de opdrachten vervuld.

Aan het einde van het spel worden goederen nog omgezet in geld, en elke 5 geld levert nog 1 prestigepunt. Er zijn strafpunten voor de spelers met piratenschijfjes.

Complicated medium+ Eurogame with more luck than one would want. But the interesting ideas save this: fundamentally there are various ways of growing your economy and you are working to mesh your growth to maximize the contracts you have.

It is much more focused and less complicated than it appears to be. Everything fits together.

Solid game, one of the best from 2013. But you probably want to be careful with who you play this with.

wow what a game, the theme and what it does is simular to a lot of euro games but it does it so very well. very tactical gameplay, very tight, very balanced and well tested. Sure it's heavy and not for everyone but if you can handle the weight this is at the top of it's genre. wonderful game.

Worker placement and tight in terms of resources and money so not usually my thing these days, but this is a clever game with some nice mechanics which mitigate the frustrations that this type of game often inflicts.

- The tightness of resources has a pressure release valve in the form of Pirate points which allows you to fail in having the requisite resources for feeding workers and the like rather than just flat out failing. Don't have enough wood then produce it at the point of need but at a cost.
 
There seems to be a nice variety of getting VP's and spotting the combos of actions to get there is quite fun.

However this is not an easily accessible game - to get the most out of it you need to play it regularly with a group who also play it regularly, otherwise it will run long and you will forever be getting rules wrong. In the end just a bit too long/complex and dry to be worth it.

Lots of stuff going on here.  Rules are not all that complex but there are many tiles that do specific things.  This can be overwhelming at first.  But is all this more complex than say Puerto Rico with the violet buildings?  Not really.  First play for everyone at the table was very long as the rules took an hour to go over.  This game needs someone to teach that knows the rules.  I think that would cut play explanation in half.  We also only finished 3/5 turns.  Looking forward to my next play.  May pick this one up if it is as good as I think.

Madeira is complex and long, difficult to teach and learn, difficult to intuitively grasp without multiple plays, and harsh to those who don't calculate their resource conversions exactly. To make a decision about where to put a worker or when to pass, you need to consider the dozen different systems your decision will affect. A dozen is too many.

At the end of one game, one person had 1 pirate point, while everyone else had 0, so that person lost 16 victory points. This does not encourage making moves by intuition.

I liked the way players jockeyed for city spaces, ship spaces, and dice placement spaces. Otherwise the game was less interactive than I prefer. The scoring tiles lock you into strategies that may prevent you from interacting.

The ratio of complexity to fun is too high for me. I've seen people use the word "elegant" to describe it. I don't think that word means what they think it means.

Sold.

RATING: 9.5
such a very clever game. Worthy of a rare 10 out of 10 in Spielbox, the revered German Games magazine? We'll see.

Multiple mechanisms interact effortlessly throughout the board and throughout the phases of a round. The endless possibilities mean there is always much to think about and many alternative paths to take. Actions are determined by die placement. However, each die placement triggers two different actions in the two action phases of a round, so you have to think carefully about what you need to do and how the actions across the board are going to combine and connect.

The interaction is high as you fight for the limited places throughout the board, both in die-action placement and with movement of your workers and ships around the fields, cities, colonies and markets. In some respects this reminds me a little of Feld's wonderful Bora Bora as everything relates to everything else. There is one major difference with Feld though. Feld excels at subtle and continual scoring mechanisms which mean that a winner will evolve through optimising a combination of the various scoring methods. This so the beauty of a good Feld. In Madeira things are far less subtle. Despite the wonderful interactions of the gameplay, the scoring is fairly blunt and full of discreet clumps of points derived from achieving, or not, various tasks. And whilst the tasks are well-balanced for achieving in later rounds, the tasks don't seem balanced in early gameplay as some tasks are easily achievable at maximum level in Round One (city majorities), whereas others are difficult to get so many points from in Round one. If you can grab one of these objectives you could find an early advantage which is then a case of catch-up for the others. And catch up isn't easy. In both games I have played the early leader simply kept the lead for the whole game, and the ranking of the other players didn't change much either. 

Worse still there are negative points for 'pirates' which you take when you are broke, which will happen through the game. These score minus 16 points to the person who has the most down to zero if you have none. This is a massive hit to your points and a possible game-loser. And pirates are kept hidden so you have to have a good memory to work out where you are in the pirate league table. 

Let's not be too negative though as Madeira is without doubt a wonderful experience in fairly complex euro-gaming. It is hugely involving indeed. All the elements apart from scoring and catch-up work beautifully and are so well integrated with each other and with the theme. It is just a shame that someone like Mr.Feld couldn't have helped with the finishing touches as the scoring is such a crucial part of the game and really the only unsatisfactory area of the game. Still, one caveat: these comments are after just a couple of plays.

Complex, heavy, euro game with great action selection mechanics which, through 5 rounds tell the story about the economic history of the island of Madeira. There is some luck involved but the players are surrounded with constant and difficult decision making during the entire game.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Variable setup of 4 main action tiles randomly placed in 3 regions where you may or may not have people which makes you move your workers around strategically and chose between main action and fixed secondary action.

I like heavy, complex games, and these designers have my attention with Panamax (favorite of 2014), however, this game just didn’t click for me. You select a turn order slot that comes with VP tiles and you will need to score a VP tile at the end of your turn, so your turn is now focused via this mechanism into a series of errands that you need to complete. The ostensible fun of the game is in completing those errands given the game’s constraints. 

The constraints are interesting enough and the main attraction here: 1) an action system whereby you place dice for a preliminary action that happens immediately but then a secondary action that you will have to pay to execute which you may not wish to do (and suffer pirate tokens), and 2) pirate dice that you can use instead of your own for extra actions but these will also drive up the cost per aforementioned action 1). So, the interaction is mostly in taking pirate dice and driving up the cost of secondary actions for secondary actions you don't particularly care about for other players. 

What didn’t work for me was the incremental micro-action efficiency of completing all the little “errands” while occasionally bumping into someone (i.e., no room left for an action die in a space you want). Just chopping up a process of tasks into a series of micro-steps does not equate to depth or interest. For all the rules overhead, I didn’t find the decisions “exquisitely painful”, just tedious. Perhaps another play would reveal more to me, but that was my instinct whereas I fell for Vinhos the first time I played it.

Madeira is firmly rooted in the tradition of Vinhos: Lots and lots of mechanisms all crammed into one game. The rules aren't overly complex and once you've played a turn or two the bricks fall into place rather quickly but the sheer amount of stuff can be a little overwhelming at the beginning.

Once everybody is on board the game moves along at a more reasonable pace. It's never going to be a short game, though, and for a game of this length and complexity luck plays a bigger role than I would like. Things work well enough but I believe the game would have benefitted from a more reductionist approach. Sometimes less is more.

Die Kreationen von WYG sind Regelmonster. Dabei zeichnen sie sich durch relativ wenig Grundregeln, aber viel Verzahnung und eine brockige Einstiegshürde aus. Was in VINHOS noch stimmig war, lief in ASGARD völlig aus dem Ruder und findet in MADEIRA nun seine gekonnte Mischung aus beidem, die die Gemeinde spalten wird. Dabei gibt es im Würfelarbeitereinsetztspiel MADEIRA nur vier Aktionen, an die jeweils eine Gebäudeaktion gekoppelt ist. Der Rest ergibt sich dann im komplexen Ineinandergriff von Plättchen, Orte und Optionen untereinander. MADEIRA findet seine Liebhaber oder spuckt den Spieler gnadenlos nach der ersten Partie aus. Vielleicht war es auch das beste Meeresblau, das ich je in einem Brettspiel gesehen habe, das meine spontane Liebe für diesen Komplexapparat begünstigte. So oder so: Meide Grübler in MADEIRA wie die verdammten Piratenplättchen.

This game isn't a bad one, but wants way too much. It can't be more true, that less can be more.

There are many (known) mechanisms, but they arn't interwoven much. I never had the feeling that things are scarce or that I couldn't do something that I urgently needed. Everything just had a different cost that you could get easily, but not at once.

So in the end, most things don't help the game in any way. They just added a few resources here and split a few things into two there, but failed to give them a good reason.

This is very much the kind of game I like, but man is it complex!  There are character actions, building actions, actions from using ships, actions for passing your turn, and guild favors which are basically actions and sometimes grant you other actions.  There are the islands, the city, the city watch, the ports, the colonies...  Which is great and all, until an unlucky roll of the dice spoils your game.

Madeira szigetén játszódó komplex játék. Három akciónk van alapból, amit három kocka jelez, ezeket egy sávról választunk, ahonnan nem csak a kockákat, hanem egy olyan jelzőt is elveszünk amit majd lepontozunk. Az első körben egyet, a harmadikban kettőt, az ötödikben hármat. Az akciók az öt helyre véletlenszerűen feltett négy karakter egyikén hajtjuk végre a kockákkal, amik ha nem érik el az adott régió értékét, kenyérrel kell fizetni (embereket küldhetünk a mezőre és erdőre, embereket mozgathatunk a városokba és ott kenyeret, pénzt vagy fát kaphatunk,, hajókat küldhetünk a kolóniákra vagy a kereskedő házakra, céhet vásárolhatunk) vagy betakarítunk az adott régióban lévő embereink után. A kilátóban lévő embereinket felhasználva a kalózkockákkal plusz akciót szerezhetünk. 

Majd utána jönnek az épületakciók, amit azok tudnak kihasználni pénzért, aki az ott lévő karakter akciót használták. Ha viszont nem akarja vagy nem tudja használni kalóz jelzőket kap. Itt küldhetünk vissza embereket a kilátóba, itt küldhetünk embereket a városba, forgathatunk vissza használt céhet stb. Minden körben fát kell fizetni a táblán lévő hajók, és kenyeret a táblán lévő emberek után (hiány esetén kalózjelzőket kapunk). 

Ez a játék nagy vonalakban. Ugyanaz a kiadó adta ki mint akik a Vinhost is, és ez is ugyanúgy összetett, nehéz játék, talán kicsit már túlságosan is. Sok mindenre kell odafigyelni, soha nincs minden ott ahol szeretnénk. Gyakorlott játékosoknak való, akik szeretik a gondolkoztató játékokat. A kockadobások miatt, túl nagynak érzik a szerencsét egyesek a játék összetettsége miatt. Ez nem teljesen igaz,mert elég jól lehet erre számolni és ez gyakorlatilag csak a kenyerek felhasználásánál jelentkezik.

There is a TON going on here--too much, in fact. On my first play, I could only pay attention to some parts of the game because it was too much to take in all at once. I did enjoy the base idea, which is that there is worker placement with an additional action after the initial placement phase, and the way these actions are paired up varies over the course of the game.  You can avoid paying for things by taking pirates, which are a penalty at the end of the game if you don't get rid of them; I found that this facilitated a starvation strategy. (1 play)

In unserer Runde haben wir nach Erklärung zu dritt fünf Stunden gespielt. ~1h pro Runde. Es gibt einfach so viel zu bedenken... das ist Wahnsinn. Man könnte fast sagen, es ist eher Arbeit als Spiel. (Aber von den Regeln her doch einfach, wenn sie erstmal erklärt sind. Es gab kaum Nachfragen.)

Excellent game.  Heavy and takes a long time to play, but the mechanics are well put together.  Many good choices are available on the board.  Not nearly as punishing as I expected.  Grabbing and scoring your tiles feels tense.

This is a preliminary rating after one play.  This game is so complex, I believe several plays are required to really understand all the moving parts.  The game components are very well made; the ship meeples are cool.  The game board has a high quality illustration on it, but it is sooo busy with many tracks and different action areas. This game is extremely challenging to teach to other players because it is so complex.  I do not think if I owned it, I could ever convince the people I normally play games with to play it.  I could imagine placing the board on the table and instructing for 5 or 10 minutes and the other players to tell me no way, they want no part of this game, and how could I blame them?  As the game went along, I came to the conclusion that this game has exuberantly passed the point of diminishing returns, that it is so incredibly complex that it is not fun.  I looked at all the different areas on the board and all the pieces we were moving and I felt like, why?  why should we care about this?  what does it all mean?  what is the motivation?  A friend walked by and asked what the game is about; what type of game is it?  and I couldn't answer him coherently.  My humble opinion is pass on this game and choose something with a more elegant, simpler design.  I also got the feeling from watching the owner of the copy we played with go beserk in the first round harvesting wood, that you couldn't win the game if you didn't do the same thing.  So I don't care for games that don't have multiple viable paths to victory.  There are multiple paths to victory, but they are all off the table if you didn't go hog wild stockpiling wood the first round :(

Our group was lucky enough to have the game explained to us by one of the authors. He did a very good job explaining the complex rules in a very clean manner and we managed to play about 1/3 of the game in about 40 minutes. 

The game is a hard core resource management and worker placement game. During each turn, the players place their workers in different places on the map. In addition, the first player to place a worker on one place is entitled to perform a privileged action. The game owes its complexity in the way these actions have been inter-connected.
As a result it is not for the faint of heart, but it presents a great challenge to fans of genre that i'm fond of.

Otro más de gestión de recursos. Inicialmente me llamó mucho la atención, pero una lectura detenida de las reglas desvela ser un juego normal. Otra cosa es que luego en la mesa sea muy agradecido de jugar.

Uso de un set de datos que permite el acceso a más posibilidades cuanto más alto es. además de que la acción en si es más potente cuánto más alto es el dado. Además existe la posibilidad de elegir dados que no son tuyos (piratas) pero que implican un coste en puntos de victoria.

This game combines more mechanics than any game I know of.  It is really hard, takes a long time to play and is super fiddly and very much a brain burner.  But for me, it's worth it to enjoy the fascinating way it all hangs together.  The game is very nuanced and there is always more to learn about it.  Worth the investment of time and money, IMO.

RATING: 8.9
Only one two-player game logged, but definitely more to come.  Madeira is an economic resource management game with a worker placement mechanism and a unique penalty system that allocates negative points to players who fail or refuse to pay the cost of feeding their workers/maintaining their ships.  The penalties, however, are not as stress-inducing as those in Agricola, plus there is a way to discard penalties. 

The mechanisms are fairly straightforward, but finding ways to efficiently order your actions to optimize your score requires deep thought.  The key appears to be finding the right balance of actions to generate resources, maintain workers/ships, and complete objectives without taking in more negative points than your opponent.  

Despite the challenging gameplay and complexity, the game is thrilling to play.  The art is great, the board's iconography is clear and the gameplay really is superb.  If the game is lacking anywhere, it would be in player interaction - but still, this is not multiplayer solitaire; and I am likely missing some of the player-interactivity due to my limited experience with the game.  The theme comes across better than most Euro board games.  With more plays, the game's complexity will not be as daunting and the overall "fun" will increase even more.

My favorite game right now. Every single decision you make has so many different implications and has the potential to get you so many different things. I like to think about each decision actually like a bundle of decisions that you make all at once. There are multiple ways to get any single given thing done, and so the real game is figuring out how to best go about doing what you're trying to do and also what other things you'll want or need along the way. Really genius how everything comes together so well and it's so much fun being pulled in so many different directions at once.

Interesting even though nothing feels original... worker placement, action selection, collect resources to spend to get either money or extra actions as well as points if you've got the right "goals".  The -18 VP if you have the most pirate tokens seems brutal and really forces you to manage those.

WOW, what a game. I had high hopes for Madeira and they were met :D. Madeira is a complex and deep strategy game, with lots of interesting decisions.

It can be hard to explain, not because the rules are hard but because they are many and are interconnected (every choice affects many things). Fortunately the game has a great graphic design that helps a lot when you are explaining the game. The art is reminiscent of Vinhos (another great game).

Madeira is a worker placement game in which the workers are dice, nothing new here BUT it was very novel to me that each worker can do two actions each turn, one immediately and one in a posterior phase. This changes everything and increases the complexity a lot because now it isn’t as simple to choose your action, you have to think many moves ahead. I also love that to actually do the second action you need to pay for it or get pirates. The pirates are a great way to maintain tension over the game, the player with most pirates will get a steep VP penalty at the end and so on. Other sources of tension are the scarcity of resources and the upkeep phase in which you need to pay food for your workers and wood for your boats, all of these have to be solved with few action dice every turn.

The dice themselves only have 3 possible values AND you have many ways to mitigate the luck factor (using food, passing first, using pirate dice, having spare money) so I feel it is minimal and with a low impact during the game, a HUGE plus for me.

The playtime is on the high side (I don’t care about that, in fact I didn’t even feel the pass of time). The downtime can be a bit high as well (I do care about this) but so far I have been able to ignore it because I’m always thinking about my moves, still, due to this,  I think Madeira can be best played with 3 players but I won’t say no to a 2/4 player game.

I don’t really care about the theme, but the game mechanics are very well integrated with it, so I really felt it in our games. Madeira has low interaction between players (I also don’t care about this, but some friends do), at most you can use a pirate dice to hurt them or block their actions with your dice, but as the game is very goal oriented I don’t think blocking spaces is a good strategy (unless it furthers your own goal of course).

Bottom line, Madeira is a true gamer´s game, very heavy and tense. I want to play again it ASAP. Perhaps the  best game I have played from 2013 (I will review this in a geeklist soon but Madeira beats Russian Railroads IMO). It has the potential to go up in my personal ratings.

As a side note, I just realized I have liked every game I have played from What's Your Game?, I will update my wish list having this into account and I have to try Vasco da Gama.

At first the game was explained to me, but now I have read the rules and I saw that the game explainer made some mistakes. Most were minor mistakes, but he forgot that the dice are rolled in the C phase for each building. I’m not sure I like this as here, the luck cannot be controlled, you have to have more money now to avoid getting pirates and to do the building action. However I have played twice this way and it hasn’t negatively impacted the gameplay for me, so for now I still enjoy the game tremendously.

Madeira is more accessible than Vinhos, which will be its closest comparable given the design pedigree.  What makes Madeira worth exploring is the two-tiered action selection mechanism, in which the actions chosen during character actions provide access to the building actions in a later phase.  

There's an engaging combination of multi-step strategy and risk management in the character actions.  Commit too early to an unpopular action and one risks another player placing a pirate die, driving up the costs of the associated building action as only those who really need the action will take it.  Often in games such as this the best path is to take the path least traveled by other players; in Madeira there are significant rewards for cooperating and some penalties for going it alone.

Madeira feels a little mechanical to me.  I appreciate the thematic touches of the fields converting, and the wood access mechanic.  However I find the overwhelming importance of the crown's request VP conversions breaks my thematic immersion.  Vinhos, for all its complexity, kept me engaged in the production of wine and the management of a winemaking business.  In Madeira, the VP conversions break the fourth wall a bit too often for my taste.

These are quibbles though; Madeira is a good game which I am happy to own and more than willing to play 10 times.

RATING: 9
Madeira is nothing but beautiful, both in its graphic design/artwork and in the mechanisms. The way all of your choices in this game are so intertwined makes for some very fun and challenging decisions, and there is something quite fun about being able to not pay the people you promised to pay (and receiving "pirates" as a result)! The game seems extremely tight (in terms of being able to do all that you want to do) but has some flexibility as well. 

The BGG average weight of this game was a deterrent to me for a while, but I am glad that I finally decided to give it a try. I think it is a chore to learn the game from the rules (though, they are extremely well-written), but the game is really not as heavy as the average weight ratings indicate. In my mind, the weight rating should be around 3.8 or so once you get over that initial learning hump.

I have seen a couple of games come down to the final choice of the crown requests going into the last round. This is a small issue (for me) with what is otherwise a spectacular game.

Madeira is a lot of game. The rules are not hard to understand in isolation there is just a lot of them, and they interlock quite intricately. It's a tight resource/action management game that rewards careful planning and somewhat flexible play. There are many ways to do most things and carving an efficient path can be difficult.

My one point of hesitation are the pirates. They add a very odd dimension to the game and have the potential to do what seems like wildly disproportionate damage. It's early days still, so I am reserving judgement for now.

This is easily one of the best games of 2013, and quite likely the best game of it's weight to be released in the past several years.

I really enjoyed my one play of this very heavy game. There are so many moving parts and options that it can be hard to get a grasp of the game at first. After the first couple of turns, everything begins to make sense and you can see how tightly connected every element is. I am really glad my friend has a copy but would probably never buy my own copy because there are a select few who would really dig this game. I think you know if this game would appeal to you. It's very much in line with this company's other offerings such as Vinhos. I am eager to play it again now that I understand everything.

Thick, heavy, deeply satisfying game. There is so much going on that it's initially incredibly difficult to wrap your head around where to start. Once you do (which could happen in round two or, if you're like me, at the beginning of your second game) and you start to understand how to manipulate the many different aspects of the game and start completing your scoring tiles.

There's no way around it - this is a long game. You are presented with so many options that it's tough not to spend at least a little time on your turn analyzing your choices. There seems to me to be a little expectation that you will participate in all areas of the board if you want to have a chance to win. You ignore any section at your own peril. 

On the negative side, a turn or two getting stuck with a set of triple-ones really stings, and can be remarkably tough to come back from. Here's hoping you have a worker or two in the city watch so that you can pull some pirates... Speaking of which, I've read a couple of articles that suggest the piracy aspect of the game is broken; particularly if everyone is deathly afraid of the negative 21 points for having the most... It's not something that's been an issue for us - people happily take pirates, and then there's a rush to purge within the last couple of rounds. For us anyways, it's added to the excitement and tension to build up that piracy and see who can knock it down again without losing momentum in scoring their tiles.

RATING: 7
Baroque game that might be too complicated for its own good. Madeira starts out with 30-45 minutes of explanations. With four players, 3+ hours will be needed. The first games consist in mastering the challenge of complexity. While exhausting, my first play left a feeling of achievement. The second play was promising as I got a grip on the system and my initial plan worked out. In fact, everything worked out so well that I think I played a near-perfect game. I got all the right goals and right guild favors at the right time. 

There's more to Madeira than simply the satisfaction of successfully mastering the complexity. It's a good although not great game which in essence consists in getting the right mix of goals while staying ahead of the various needs. In a good game you'll ride the wave and getting everything you need is a breeze but once in heavy waters there's not much to do to get out of them.

This is a game that would benefit from a revised/edited rule book.  However, my group has played it a couple of times with positive feedback.  Each time we've had to wrap our heads around a fairly esoteric rule set, but, once we did, we were rewarded with a fairly pleasant gaming experience.  The base game seems to more heavily favor the city compared to the other core game systems, but the expansion is supposed to help that to emphasize the colonies a bit more.  Too bad it doesn't handle more than 4 players

The game is probably better than I rate it. It just goes against what I'm looking for in a game. The rules explanation took forever and the game dragged out substantially. It is completely JASE, an abstract cube pusher. I'm not against cube pushing per se, but this game is honestly too much for me and I won't be open to trying it again. For those with the desire to invest time and energy into the game, I'm sure it pays off. But it's just not for me.

A heavy and complex game which forces you to try and think a lot about different connections on the board. Maybe there's some unnecessary complexity, but overall a solid worker placement / resource management euro with a really nice dice mechanism. Towards the end of the game the punishments for not feeding your boys and boats become maybe too light and the end of the game promotes the importance of turn order maybe too much.

RATING: 7
I am a bit on the edge about this this one. I probably need a few more games to really have an opinion about it.

Mechanics and rules seem needlessly complicated and awkward, nothing really seems to fit together in an intuitive way. This could probably be streamlined quite a bit by leaving out redundant elements here and there, without losing too much of the complexity of the game.
As a result, this game takes quite long for its type. I don't mind playing a challenging worker placement game like this one, but I am not sure if I want to do so for 3h+.

On the positive side this game might offer a lot of complex decision, which interact in very different ways. The main reason I am still undecided about this one is that it probably takes a couple of games until you grasp how the various elements of the game interact.
A lot of mechanics seem really interesting such as changing values of different trade goods over time, or costs of actions decreasing if more players take them, etc...

First Impressions:

Really enjoyed this longer game which took us 4 hours with rule explanation when playing for the first time.  There is quite a bit to work through learning how the parts work together, but when one sees how the parts interlock, it is fun to pull the levers.  Pirates are an interesting touch that can score negative points at the end of the game and the favor tiles from the city are very helpful (helps that if you can untapped them, you can use them again).

Gamers who dislike constraints need not apply themselves to this one.  [b][thing=95527][/thing][/b] is no sandbox; it is a mountainous island with narrow, constricted paths.  Exploiting this island is all about squeezing the most out of every action including squeezing extra actions out of actions.  Initially, I found the constraints as annoying as they were thematically weak.  For example, if the Commander (who grants the shipping action) is in Moinho and I need bread (which seems to be only baked in Moinho), I have to put a worker in Moinho.  But if I don't want to ship anything, I'm wasting an action because that's pretty much all the Commander can do for me.  I suppose I could harvest instead of ship, but I only have one field.  It's suboptimal, but that's the only way to get that bread I need to feed my workers.  Once I got over the frustration of forced restrictions such as these, I started to enjoy the game more as an optimization puzzle to be solved.  But one that your opponent could mess with any time you weren't careful.  [b][thing=95527][/thing][/b] is definitely a heavy Euro from the same (Portuguese) school that brought us [b][thing=42052][/thing][/b] and [b][thing=72225][/thing][/b].  But of the three, I may just prefer this new one the best.  It's certainly less fiddly than [b][thing=42052][/thing][/b] and more intuitive than [b][thing=72225][/thing][/b].  Thematically, it's the least interesting, but I found myself enjoying it quite a bit.  Unfortunately, the complexity and length made it impossible to get to the table so I traded it away.  And I regret that.

Not normally a fan of dice in games , but their is little luck here. The use of the pirate dice is great. So much going on , virtually all the resources are used in two different ways. Wood is needed to build ships and get citizens from the city. Money to buy a second action from the dice roll and buy wood . Bread to feed your workers and change the dice to a higher number. This game isn't a piece of cake ( Madeira Cake )

RATING: 8.5
This game is bordering on the level of complexity I can enjoy in a game. It would be out of reach, had I not played a lot of different worker placement games previously. Because of this, the mechanisms were somewhat easy to understand.

All this aside, Madeira is the best board game I have played in a long while. I'm curious to see how it is with more than 2 players, but it's not a concern, as we useually play most games 2 player.

Edit: Good with 3 players as well. Won't like it with 4 though, I'm pretty sure. There would be simply too much information to keep track of.

A very complicated game with non-intuitive rules and a poor rule book.  But, once you figure out how to play, it's a very rewarding game with lots of interesting decisions.  It's long, but it doesn't feel too long because you spend your opponents' turns plotting your next move.

1 play review:  Meh, I tend to like heavy-ish Euros but this one was just so dull and over-stayed it's welcome.  Some neat mechanisms but they seemed to be forced together in an awkward manner.  I may be willing to try it once more but I would not be the one to make that suggestion.

2nd play update:  A little better w/3P.  Still a bit chaotic and pirate paranoia was paralyzing.  A 3rd play may be necessary to be sure all is what it seems.  So for now, rating moved from 6 to 6.75

RATING: 3
(comment after 1 play with 2 very experienced Madeira players and 2 newbies to this game; problem: i will probably not play this one again)

This is not a game for everyone. If you are just looking for some gaming fun, stay away from Madeira. If you like to eat "complexity" for breakfast, don't let this game pass you by.

My main disappointment with the game is, that it takes long to learn and explain, while it offers very little original elements, a very abstract implementation of the history of Madeira, and after 3 or more hours of play, dice can still make a huge difference in the final scoring.

I could still change my mind, but I think this is not my kind of ballgame. If I would play a game in this category, I would prefer [thing=120677][/thing] or [thing=126163][/thing] (the latter being certainly lighter than Madeira), where the gameplay seems more natural and logical, easier to grasp. 

About the material:
The game doesn't have enough bread tokens !?! So you need to keep the score with pencil and paper.
The overview sheet sucks. It doesn't make things clearer.
The board doesn't look very appealing.

Minus: 3 (duration) - 4 - 5 - 6 - 8 (dice in such a heavy game?) - 9 (only for nerds) - [-1]

We've come pretty far from time when Tigris&Euphrates was considered heavy gamers game. My favorite game, Agricola, is pretty fiddly but it pays off via perfect theme integration. Terra Mystica is another recent perfect gamers game,  it's heavy and but T&E-esque - after first game you'll know how to play and it's fun. Madeira is fiddly, themeless, boring, complex for sake of being complex and on top of that it's HOLLOW. It's complex just because someone wanted to make a complex game. Boardgame equivalent of film student making 'art' film, pretentious pile of --. I'm done with this kind of games...

Similar to Vinhos, lots of running parts and a dense, not always well ordered rulebook.  There is enough theme to make things work, although I felt bad dice could really be tough, and the random locations of the actions could also selectively hurt some players.  Still, there appears to be a range of waya to win.  I should have gotten more of the nobles on my side, but even so I was in the running with pure shipping approach.  I can't say this is better than Vinhos, so I will not be getting it, but if you don't have that game, this would also be a fine choice.

Holy heavy euro. This is like some crazy ramped-up RosenFeld hybrid. There's a ton going on but that being said once you get through a play it all fits together quite nicely. 

While I did like the dice, and how they work in this game, I also found them to be very frustrating. There's a mechanic where you worker-place your dice onto action squares. Later on all the dice in those squares are rolled and you must pay 10-the total roll or take a pirate penalty there. Money is available but takes a lot to earn it. This is a game of planning and out-maneuvering your opponents. Those carefully laid plans can all but be extinguished if you can't pay for your actions.

Additionally there's a ton of upkeep. Ships need lumber, workers need bread. Pirates are removed from working the wall but you have a good chance of losing workers there. So much going on overall I'm just not sure it was really that fun. I mean, I'm impressed for sure but more and more I find myself not wanting to use up my remaining brain cells on games like this. Surely many will love this game and I'll definitely check out what Soledade and Sentieiro come up with next.

RATING: 4
Yet another spreadsheet game. Some of these games have redeeming qualities that make them fun or otherwise interesting. I can't think of anything Madeira did that really caught my attention or made me want to play it again. Most of the "innovations" here are needlessly complexifying without adding a whole lot to the game. You have a ton of options, but really only a few of them are actually available to you at any given time due to the various requirements you have to consider for each action. It's the exact opposite of emergent complexity, where simple rules lead to expansive, branching possibilities; here overly-complex option-laden rules devolve into just a couple viable moves. Decisions might be complicated, but they are never tough, frequently providing a "six of one, half dozen of another" dilemma. Is the set of 3-2-2-1 dice all that different from the 3-1-1-1 dice? Not really. This is a game of accruing minuscule advantages over the course of dozens of tiny actions. There's no drama, no decisive moments, just constant optimization through a haze of complexity that seems like "depth."

One thing that might bring me back is perhaps the focus on timing of short- to mid-range plans. You need to plan your pushes for VPs in the right order and at the right time to maximize your gains, and this focus works its way into the Piracy mechanism as well. It seems futile to avoid getting Pirate tokens for the whole game, so you want to get them earlier, allowing you plenty of opportunity to get rid of them (which isn't hard), rather than get stuck with Pirates late, after you can do anything about it. Interesting? Perhaps. Worthy of repeated plays to fully grok the right combos to max out the number in cell AA437? Probably not.

Initially frustrating but I've grown to like this one more after repeated plays, all on BGA. It is a very unforgiving game--a mistake or a very unlucky roll of the dice can doom you, because if you don't get your engine up and running quickly you'll find yourself with no wood, bread, or money to do anything. On the other hand, if you are careful you'll do well, though there's a certain amount of pure luck based on the dice rolls and allotment of characters in buildings.

Main tip: even if there are other possible actions you can do, the advantages of passing early and claiming the right spot on the passing column plus getting first pick of dice and guild-flips next round are often far greater. -- Second tip: always keep at least one worker in region 2 and region 3 so you can use Moinho during the building resolution phase for getting bread, and Fortaleza for putting a guy in the Watch and discarding pirates. Getting a few workers into the colonies early on will also help with avoiding wasting time on too many harvest actions.

First design from portuguese designers. They also run a Portuguese CON for gamers and designers.

I could rate this higher, but they made one design choice I consider not very good. The random placement of characters. If the placement was known to all players will make the game more strategic, bring more interesting decisions and planning, and will lower the luck involved to future moves.

After a few plays the game seems repetitive due the very small choice on the goal tiles.

Many compare this design to Vinhos. Its a good game but could use a bit more innovation or originality.

Madeira is a well crafted worker placement game with some interesting takes on familiar mechanisms. I particularly like how the game conditions change predictably (the movements of the nobles, the goods produced on the islands etc.) and although there are random changes as well, they are all open to the players to react to. However, sometimes the rules feel more complex than the depth returned and the long-term decisions are often restricted by short-term need (you can't focus on one resource but need a bit of everything each turn). Still, Madeira is a pleasant and surprisingly thematic game that I'd be happy to play over a glass of the island's famous wine.

In this complex game based on 16th century Portugal, players are building ships, moving workers to get goods, and fulfilling crown requests to earn VPs. Each round, you have 3 actions to do things. The complexity lies in that after your actions have been taken, you have to pay for the building tile to gain more bonuses. Sometimes you have to take pirates if you can't pay for the tile. Sometimes you have to pay goods to fulfull your actions. 

During the crown request phase,  on the 3rd round, sometimes you may get stuck without a choice, and that worries me. I'm also not clear on the rules on when you can play certain tiles, or when you have to pay extra for your actions. There are a ton of things going on here, and if you enjoy the complexity, you'll enjoy the game. 
I've played the online version, but face to face, it could take a long time sorting out rules. It's fun to pursue different strategies. It's a decent game, but there are a few things that prevent it from being great. I'm not clear on how turn order switches and it gets repetitive especially by the 4th round. I'll happily play, and glad I got to try it out.

Very beautiful game. It offers a lot of choices, both strategical and tactical.

It is a gamer's game, but not as complex as some people are afraid of, I would say more or less the same weight as Bora Bora. There are a lot of different things to remember, but they are simple in themselves: since there are a lot of these micro-rules it can be that in the first games one makes some mistakes (not because the rules are not clear, but because one forgets some details). But after 2 or 3 games everything becomes easy and it is worth the effort.

All elements are well integrated and it is not a victory point salad, but a very good design. The game offers a lot and replayability is one of its main strengths. 

It scales well and it is surprisingly VERY good in two. Maybe in three it is a bit less interesting (but really just a tiny bit), because the game seems to become less tense.

There is some luck, but inside my limit of acceptance. The random mechanisms are useful in two directions: they enhance replayability and they reduce AP (because it is impossible to calculate everything and so players have to use intuition).

There is interaction: the more one plays the more it becomes evident that to be strong at this game one has to look and react to what other players are doing.

If you like "heavy" games, do not miss this.

I love how it makes my brain fry while I'm playing it. It's thematic, in a historical perspective, as it ties the concepts of the Portuguese Coroa's demands from the explorers and the changing in the cultures in the island to the game system quite well. It could benefit, however, from some streamlining, specially when it comes to the worker placement and the cities parts.

AP-proned people should stay at least 10km from it. I've counted turns of 30 minutes from such people in this game.

Continuing the trend of late of these great medium/medium-heavy games that take an extremely long time to explain (Asgard, Bora Bora) -- featuring a high degree of interconnectedness.

Another overwrought euro with nothing but the complexity standing out. Really there is nothing here I have not seen before. Why bother.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
It has quite a few rules and the explanation will not be short, but it's not as complex as some other medium or heavy games.

It is an economic worker placement game; an euro, but its theme is very well integrated in the game, with very few concessions to game mechanics. The components are nice, and the graphic design is good too. 

The game is quite long in itself; I don't believe it can be finished in 2 hours, as the box states. We were slow, but it took us almost 3 hours to through 3 turns; we had to quit then. I would not say it's AP-prone, but you certainly need some time to meditate some decisions. With some experience, I think 4 players might be finished in 3 hours.

I must say that the game no way seemed to be as heavy as people say. I played my fiest game with a conservative strategy because of that, but at the third turn, I already had enough materiales to pay the upkeep for my 3 boats and 12 workers during the following 4th and 5th turn. I also had two objectives for 15 points assured. It did not seem difficult to achieve.


The aspect I enjoy the most is how the decisions are configurated: when placing workers, you choose between of pairs of actions randomly paired; also, when choosing initiative (very important), you also choose the dice sets (important too!), the objectives (really important again) and the characters whose abilities will be refreshed.

What I don't enjoy that much is:
-> The thing that makes the game harder is the competetition you might have with the objetives. If you don't have competition, chances are you'll score maximum points easily. If you do have competition, you will have to spend more resources and chances are you will not be able to maximize your score. I don't like this happening in a medium to heavy euro, since you can't really control (nor anticipate) the objectives your rivals will go for. It is a random element that can be really punishing and I see that conditioning the final outcome.
-> Dice rolls are not final, but they have too much importance for a medium-to-heavy game.

More or less, these are the same issues I had with Panamax (too much randomness for such a heavy game), a game by the same authors.

Overall, it's a nice game, but it has nothing special that stands out. I would willingly play again, but probably I would get bored after a few plays.

A heavy and long game with an interesting dice system. Very enjoyable despite its length and complexity, and worth trying at least once even if the publisher's track record makes you hesitant. WYG seems to be slowly improving their output; This is a significant improvement over Vinhos in overall quality and playability of the product. The board is still too much of an Excel sheet, and there is still some excess complexity, as well as parts that could have used a bit more development.

Played nine times now, enjoyed it a lot and really want to play again.

Its good for players who enjoy puzzling things out, because there are so many options/paths you can take.  One action greatly affects what you are doing elsewhere.  (i.e., I strongly disagree with a comment I saw elsewhere saying the parts are not related - quite the contrary - everything you do effects everything else you are doing or want to do).

- lots of strategic paths
- lots of replayability
- lots of inter-related parts
- satisfying experience
- doesn't feel 'broken' or under tested in any way
- takes a good 2 hours or more to play
- takes a long time to learn
- well-designed board (if a bit cluttered), that reminds you of most of the main rules you need to know

The rules took me a long time to study before I could play and teach the game.  In teaching, I found it easier to just play through a round or two guiding the newbies - the alternative of explaining each and every little rule doesn't work - too much for anyone to absorb just by listening.

Fine game, however too long playing & I have my doubts if the pirate token mechanic cannot be exploited by simply ignoring it whilst playing and sucking up the 16 point penalty negated by lots of points gained during the play. Also feel more like work than a game.

Fascinating euro. If Feld, Rosenberg, and Brunnhofer designed a game together, it might be like Madeira.

A gamer's game, maybe. Learning curve. Meaty. Juicy, too. Much tactics with strategies that can be foiled. Replayable. One of those games that takes a game or two to realize truly what the heck you're trying to do.  I can't say that this intuitive, but it is very interesting.

This game is fairly complicated, and does not play quickly.  On my first play, when i didn't know what I was doing, it seemed fun enough;  I stumbled on a winning strategy, putting my ships out on the first round, and locking up access to wood and food to maintain the ships and my pieces out on the board.  On my 2nd play, I could not do what I wanted to do, and became bored with the game.  While open to additional plays, this is not destined to become a favorite.

The task of learning, teaching and playing this euro beast was daunting. The first round in the first game, took more than an hour. Although, the game played really smooth after that. The game is VERY interesting with loads of interlocking mechanisms. The most interesting mechanism is the dice placement, where the price depends on how many is using the spot. Excellent game!

Rating after 1 play: I am rather torn with this game: This is a Euro game, with many agonizing decisions I love to take. Still I am not sure if every rule is necessary for the game or just there to blur the decision making tree. So the game gets long, maybe longer than necessary. For a first time it was a very fulfilling experience.
Other things I love: The scoring conditions that the player get to choose throughout the game. The varying gameboard preparation. That not every resource may be traded with other resources.
Still this might be more work, than play. Similar as with Vinhos.

The first game we made a major mistake in the rules and the game seemed way off with the incorrect action being too powerful. We noticed halfway and started over. Then it was much more balance. This is one of the more complex games I have played in a while and I play quite a few heavy Euro's. You must place your dice in different regions to perform actions, but there is a lot to it, from selecting the dice to the way you get points (you select tiles and then score them at different points of the game). If you like heavy Euros this one would be worth checking out, but I am still on the fence on whether it is just complicated and not fun or a deep strategy game that is worth many plays.

Wow this is one complex Euro. I actually enjoy it a lot! 27/12/14

Update: Yes my first Euro to hit a 10! Not much else to say really. A fabulous game!

Update: I lowered it 1 point as I feel the colonies are just a tiny bit underdone compared to the rest of the game balance wise. Still an excellent game though. I think the promo helped it a lot in rejigging things and should of been put in with the game originally. 18/03/15

Update: Down a pip to 8.5. I think the nobles are a little tacked on theme wise and looking at my 9s this is definitely not worthy to hold the same position.

Madeira is a resource management game with a ton of interconnected mechanisms.  Dice determined what sorts of actions were available each turn, but a player's choice of action also determined and/or constrained what a player could do on several other fronts.  It was definitely an interesting game, but it didn't really have a big reward or something to draw me in, for the level of complexity it presented.

RATING: 7
Not as heavy as people make it out to be, but you do feel very limited in choices. You have about 20 things you need to do and can only do 5. The rules, while not long, are dense and it takes a solid read through and part of a play to piece it all together in your head. Explaining it becomes easier once you've played a game, although everything is interlocking. A fun game, but I think it might shine more with additional players.

Includes the Ambassadors promo.

RATING: 4
Madiera is one of the new crop of euros with a high degree of complexity. There is a bit of resource management, area control, set collection, with the tiniest bit of engine building present.

During the game, players are placing workers that will activate in two different phases, the first of which occurs immediately, and the second of which is optional, though declining to take the action penalizes the player unless he pays. The cost of this second action (called a building action) is determined by dice, which are added to the area by taking that action. The more players take the action, the cheaper it becomes, though the final cost is unknown. 

There is a LOT going on in Madiera, and some of it is very interesting. For example, players choose turn order, which also grants the ability to potentially refresh a used power and dictates which point scoring objectives may be used. This makes for some tough decisions regarding when to go, and what goals one is trying to accomplish.

The game requires a lot of careful plannning, but the execution of that plan is dependent on the actions of the other players. This led (in my experience) to a lot of tactical decision making, while the game is pressing players to take a strategic view. I tend to like tension in games, but this was unsatisfying to me. I don't mind planning, and I don't mind being blocked or shut out by other players, but the opaqueness of the system made it difficult to plan for contingencies. 

Overall, Madiera is complex, but didn't feel deep to me. I don't mind long and tactical games (Dominant Species is in my Top 10), but this is a tactical game disguised as a strategic experience. This, combined with a large amount of downtime and a dull theme make this game a pass for me.

I was super stoked to play this due to the hype and my enjoyment of medium / heavy games.  However, I was not a fan on my first play.  I'm not usually put off by dry games (love some Gerdts), but this did not grab me.  Moreover, it feels like there is too much planning for the randomness of the character distribution each round and the scoring tiles. A great strategy may be bolstered or foiled in future rounds depending on how well the building and character actions align. Perhaps with future plays, I will come to enjoy this more, but I am not jonesing to play it. I found the rule book somewhat difficult to parse, although this doesn't seem to be a common complaint.  I  prefer Zhan Guo (by a fair bit) and Asgard (just a little) in the WYG library.

I normally like the meatier stuff from WYG? and Madeira is no exception. It's what you can expect: lots of rules and no idea of what to do the first time you play. 

This game however will suffer from AP a lot even if you're experienced players, because you really have to count if you for example will have enough bread and if you're in all the places you wanna be.  

So my advice: only play this with the 'right' people ;-)

First impression: Phew, the rules are dense, but once you get everything down, it's not too difficult to play and flows pretty smoothly. Winning however, is a different story. This game is deep. The decision space is massive and you can take different paths to scoring as efficiently as possible. 

After one play, I can tell that it'll take handful of games to grok the strategies. All the elements are interconnected and dependent on each other, making for a "crunchy" experience.

Unfortunately, I'm unsure if it's a keeper or not. I'd like to explore the game a little more, but it may just be too heavy to bring out with our game group.

RATING: 8
In this game, dice get rolled and then players select a group of 3 dice, which act as their workers for taking actions on the main board. The dice have numbers running 1-3 printed on them, which match the three regions of the board. To take an action, you have to place a die into an area, and then pay the difference between your die and the number of the region in bread tokens. The actions in the game give it a point salad feel, but like in the best point salad games, the different areas you can place into are all intertwined in interesting ways. One of the most intriguing things about the game is that each region of the map has an action spot that has a top half and a bottom half. The top half gets covered by a tile with printed actions on it, and that tile gets randomized each round, so that every turn the action selection choices are a little different.

That dice rolling mechanic - UGH.  I hate, hate, hate, HATE this game.  It's very rare that I steadfastly refuse to play a game again after 1 playthrough when everybody else in my group is asking to try it out, but this is one of them.  Don't even get me started on the fact that they don't give you enough tokens, or that it's at its core just another spreadsheet type of game.  

This is one of those games that, on its surface, seems to be dressed up with all sorts of great things, but when you get past the fancy coverings, realize that there is nothing of any real value there.

RATING: 2
Second time ever playing though I didn't remember the first.

Let me first say that likely my impression was coloured by the circumstances of the play. K wanted to play it to see if he should buy it. He was insistent though it was after 11 that night. It would have been better if it was one of the first games of the night. We broke one of our rules to not learn a new game after dinner never mind close to midnight.

Of course K worked through the rules so he trounces J and me. It wasn't even close.

However, what really bugged me about the game was that I could feel the game was over as early as round 2. This game has an optimum strategy and several things you must do often and at the right time. If you don't do them, you're doomed. There is a proper path to follow with little deviation. By round 3 I started to realize how things interacted together. For example, K built all his workers in region 3 and harvested like crazy, J and I were in region 3, big mistake.

He started to seed the city with workers, we failed to understand the implications of not doing so. By the time he was collecting 12 wood and later 12 bread on top of all his harvested goods for his ships, our games had collapsed and we were trying to just survive or hope we would get 2 out of our 3 actions if lucky.

So the rich get richer and the poor should go home. So by the time it dawned or me why i needed workers in the city in wood or bread it was too late. It takes several rounds of actions to get them there, it's not easy. If you don't do it early, by round 4 or 5 it's way too late to collect.

Any game that penalized poor choices this early in the game and impacts the rest of your game, with no hope of turning it around or at least having fun by exploring one aspect of it, is doomed in my eyes.

This game has elements I like in games. Lots of complex interaction between actions, deep strategy etc. But unfortunately, it just left a bad taste in my mouth.

Bottom line, it was a 3 hour marathon, where J and I pushed cubes around just so that K had opponents so he could see by how many points he was going to trounce us. No one wants to sit through 3 hours of misery, playing a game they had to be talked into, just waiting for it to be over, knowing from 20 minutes in that there is absolutely no chance to win. They are there for the benefit of the winner already determined by superior play for the next 3 hours.

It's like an obstacle course where the ropes to swing across to mud pit are almost out of reach so there's a good chance the first time you try to swing you'll land face first in the mud, and the hurdles are just a bit higher than you suspect so the first jump ends with you again on your face because your toes just tripped you up, and the whole event takes twice as long as you thought it might. With a little practice it'll probably all work out but someone could have cleaned it up a bit to have most of the challenge and a lot more fun and there's another place across the street that got it right.

Main first impression is that they tried too hard to make this a heavy game. So the end result is rules for the sake of rules, lots and lots of steps to go through to achieve little.

Currently I think it's a mid weight game trying to pretend it's heavy. Found it tedious rather than interesting. 

I like Nippon better. Am planning to give Madeira another few plays though. Don't want to write it off too soon. Will see what I think of it then.

Have only played it once, and liked it pretty well, but it seemed like in spite of the complexity, and the fact that each action really had a couple of effects through the interlocking mechanisms, there wasn't that big of a play space -- seemed that some strategies were clearly superior to others, so the best decision was pretty apparent, and clearly superior to the alternatives.

This one is a bit of a brain burner.  I don't dislike heavy games - in fact, I enjoy a lot of them - but this one seemed heavy for a different reason than most.  Most heavy games are a bit long, have a lot of complicated rules and keep you constantly thinking.  This game was heavy because it was murky.

Compare this to say Mage Knight.  Mage Knight is rather heavy.  There are a lot of things going on in that game and lot to keep track of.  BUT what I want to do is clear.  I need to travel to X, fight Y, recruit Z, etc.  It's very straight forward in what needs to happen - it's just up to me to figure out the most efficient way to make that happen.

In this game I found myself confused as to what I even wanted to do - let alone how to do it!  I'm a pretty smart guy and I can usually pick up on what a game is wanting me to do after a turn or two.  I may not remember all the rules right away, but the system becomes clear to me rather quickly.  In Madeira, it took me about half the game before I was able to attempt anything that resembled a strategy.

I would play this again given the right setting...but I better be able to crawl into bed to go to sleep afterward.  Yikes.

RATING: 7.6
[u]The Positive[/u]
(+) Very intriguing intertwined gaming mechanisms. The core of the game engine is 'combinations': each round character actions get combined randomly with building actions. A set of 3 blue guild dice get combined with a certain type of guild to be reactivated and more importantly with a selection of important scoring tiles. Players take actions with placing a die on a character (residing in a certain building). When a player places a black pirate die on a character, the potential damage caused to players taking the action regularly with their own blue dice increases if they can't (or won't) pay the required cost for using the building afterwards. All those elements make sure that each round, when the board gets set up again interesting opportunities arise or whole strategies have to be rethought. The dice mechanic also creates interesting tension: having other players place pirate dice on actions you want to take with your regular dice in order to gain access to the building action can be painful (cost of using the building rises and the penalty for not paying increases greatly). When placing your regular blue dice, you hope that others will follow with their blue dice, so that the cost of using the building later on will decrease.

(+) The game mechanisms ensure that the game generates challenging decisions all of the time. Each and every decision counts. The mechanism in which players collect scoring tiles allowing to score massive points when a certain requirement is met, and put them to use at the end of round 1, 3 and 5 gives players some goal to plan for in an otherwise extremely dynamic and volatile environment.

(+) Reasonable gaming time for a rather heavy game: with a playtime of about 35-40 min / player, a 4-player game can get played in about 2,5 hours, even with newcommers.

(+) Handy player aids and a nice looking and well organized board, displaying relevant information. This aids a lot in explaining and understanding the game. The rule set is also rather structured.

[u]The Negative[/u]
(-) The theme of this game is rather weak and feels 'pasted on'. Ok, at the beginning of its exploitation, Madeira was filled with forests and you see players tearing those down in search for wood and in order to gain access to fertile land during the game. But really, that's the only thematic feel the game will offer while you play. Many game rules are obviously meant for the gameflow to go well (and they do a great job at that!), but do not make any thematic sense. If you want to enjoy this game, you must be able to play the game for what it is: a very clever mechanical beast which will challenge you from start to finish, but which won't tell a thematic story whatsoever.

(-) My main complaint about this game is that I don't think that the core game engine is very 'stable'. I mean that a very insignificant small factor (this can be a choice, for example deciding not to pay for a building and taking a single puny pirate token - but it can also be a random factor like which character gets assigned to which building during round set-up or which set of dice get combined to which selection of scoring tiles) can have a *huge* impact on scoring opportunities. In our last game, one player got stuck with one single pirate token and this costed him 16 penalty points, which is very significant in this game - sure not relative to having a single puny pirate token. Getting stuck with a useless scoring tile near the end of the game could cost you about 15 points (possibly more). Having a bad die roll for determining the cost of a building action could harm you greatly. To some players, huge point swings caused by minor effects might be an advantage as they add to the tension and the dynamic of the game, but to me these effects in Madeira are so significant that I find they bring a little too much chaos to the game, eclipsing an important part of the overall strategy you try to implement while playing.

(-) There is a considerable amount of luck dependence for a game of this heavy weight. As stated before, the random distribution of characters to buildings can have significant consequences and there is no way to mitigate this. The dice sets that get linked to certain guilds and scoring tiles can also be favorable or unfavorable to certain players. Dice rolls to determine cost of building actions also bring a certain amount of luck to the game (but for some reason I don't mind this last aspect as usually the impact of this is limited and there sure is a correct correlation between the number of blue guild dice and building cost).

(-) Finally I'm not sure if many different strategies are viable. Maybe this is a non-issue, as this is certainly more of a tactical game than a strategic game, and the art of playing Madeira right probably lies in identifying the correct opportunities generated by a dynamic random board set-up. I do have some doubt as it comes to re-occuring scoring tiles and the possible instability this may bring into the game. In my opinion some general strategic lines should always be followed if you want to avoid that the game beats you down. (see 'tips' section below).

[u]Conclusion[/u]
The least that can be said of Madeira is that it is a very intriguing game. The very dynamic random board set-up at the start of every round has a huge impact on scoring opportunities or pitfalls. This makes for a wonderfully deep and rich challenge for fans of heavy tactical games, but it also makes the game prone to a rather high level of chaos which will appeal less to the strategists amongst gamers. The lack of a theme well integrated with the game mechanics makes that players don't experience an epic story while taking their actions, but the clever intertwined game mechanics are sure to keep heavy euro-fans interested till the very last action. Madeira was the first game from Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro and Paulo Soledade and it was immediately clear that the designers put a lot of thought and love into building an exceptional and unique game engine which keeps spawning interesting challenges. They did this again in 2015 with Nippon when they came up with a very clever and original 'worker takement' mechanic which drives this game smoothly (and its players happily crazy :) ). Madeira and Nippon share some similarities in the fact that they are euro-style games with some very intriguing and original core concepts, but they play out totally differently and I'm happy to have both games in our collection. Madeira sure is the heavier of the two and offers a little more 'surprises' in its very dynamic board set-up, but still I think the designers have grown with Nippon, which I slightly favor over Madeira due to the better integration between tactical and strategic play.

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) Always have at least one worker in region 2. Having no worker here could get you into trouble as the building actions over there allow access into the cities (which is important in order to obtain bread/wood/money) and an easy access to bread. What's more, region 2 remains rather accessible (unlike the buildings in region 3 which require better dice or bread in order to take those actions) and has 2 possible action field in stead of the sole action field in the most accessible (and therefore sometimes hotly contested region 1). This makes workers in region 2 the most valuable of all workers placed into fields on the islands.
(*) When placing workers in the fields, be mindful that region 3 is the least accessible. Its building actions are very powerful, but it could be hard to gain access to this region and in my experience region 3 gets pumped with more pirates than any other region because of this. Avoid betting everything on region 3 despite its spoils.
(*) Getting the right scoring tiles is very important as these tiles provide the main source of points. It is worthwile to go early in turn order so that you have the opportunity of selecting the right set of guild dice and a scoring tile. This becomes even more important at the end of the game, when the choices of scoring tiles decrease. It could be worthwile to pass early in the second last round in order to select the right scoring tile for you to be used in the last round. Turn order is very important in Madeira!
(*) Make sure you always have enough bread, as this is a powerful tool to buy flexibility when placing dice. If you don't have enough bread, you are at the mercy of the whims of a very dynamic and random board set-up. Getting up in the mill early can therefore be quite powerful.
(*) If you don't care much for the building action, always consider placing a pirate die early in the round. It could harm your oppenents when placed tactically and it decreases the chance of an unexpected pirate die showing up on the action you aim for in a next turn. Using pirate dice gives you more actions, but this also means that you will probably pass later than your oppenents, which could deny you from getting the right scoring tile and the right guild dice in the next round.
(*) Getting many ships out early is risky as they will require wood every single round. In most cases it is better to get your ships out later in the game (they are really useful as they provide many points with 40% of the scoring tiles. The market spots for ships is one of the most effective ways to earn you money and the extra action tiles in the colonies are pretty yummie too!)
(*) Don't be too afraid to take some pirate tokens. In our experience it is not too difficult to get rid of some tokens, and usually players end the game with no pirate tokens at all. I don't know if it would be a viable strategy to pile up pirate tokens, taking the 16 point penalty but don't having to feed your people, avoid paying for some not very useful building actions or collect wood for your ships. In any case, avoid having more than 20 pirate tokens. One player gobbling up all pirates also makes life easier on his/her opponents. I would advise against such strategy.
(*) Getting a good combination of guild tiles can be really powerful. The game offers enough ways to recharge your tiles and use them frequently.
(*) Grain buys you bread by moving up in the mill, sugar buys you much coins by the rewarding sugar market, grapes gain you access to the colonies. Early in the game grain has priority, in mid game should you run low on money sugar will come in handy and late in the game, when you have a scoring tile relating to the colonies you will need many grapes.

This game has a reputation of being heavy. It's not, yes it's long and there are a lot of small rules (too many for its sake IMO) but the strategic depth is minimum - instead asking the players to make a lot of small tactical decisions that sort of matter but are not hard or worth overly agonizing over.

That said I liked my one play of it but it could have been streamlined to better effect, and more importantly cutting play time to where it got a chance to hit the table more regularly. It also has a huge amount of potential for king making moves without people realizing (or avoidable only by playing suboptimally) and I suspect my rating will come down with more play for this reason.

At first this game seemed extremely heavy with great strategic depth.  But after 3-4 plays, we found that we could max out our scores on every single goal and get rid of all of our pirates every single time.  So we always scored very high and the game came down to just a few points difference.  It seems like such an interesting game, but we just didn't feel like it was still a challenge after playing it 5 times (both 4 player and 2 player games). Despite all of the initial complexity, the game ended up being very simple and easy to optimize.  We wanted their to be more room to improve our scoring.  We liked the goals, but felt like they were too easy to maximize. We enjoyed learning this game, but it just doesn't provide a lasting challenge. Traded away the game for Eminent Domain and Mysterium.

--Nov2013-- A lot of moving parts.  Graphic design reminiscent of Vinhos.  And yet (unlike that other title) it works for me.  I think the majority difference isn't one of complexity or rules load, but instead the fact that not once during this game did I wonder whether we'd missed a step in some previous turn; or forgotten a rules detail; or neglected to apply some constraint.  There's a lot going on, but equally loads of opportunities for clever play.
I wonder a bit as to the randomness, though; it might feel a bit too much after several more plays.

I love the layers you find in this game: I need a certain guild member tile, so I need wood, so I need to take the mayor action, so I need to have access to wood, so I need to move guys around on the field, so I need a 3, but I only have a 2, so I need some bread...  Very cool choices and planning ahead.

But I think the freshest mechanics to me are the character actions which are followed by/paid for by a building action.  And I also like the option of moving workers/people around instead of bringing in new ones from home.

The theme is really cool, too.  These islands were one of the first major discoveries by Portugal.  Wheat was important early in their history, but then sugar and wine and grapes became the main focus.

Excellent game!

Holy cow, so many options.  I love the turn order as well as how the options on the islands constantly change.  There seems to be constant pressure for food and money.  The pirates weren't really an issue in our play and I think they'd be more of an issue with 4p.  You can definitely feel the Vinhos influence with the different shipping markets, but Madeira seems a lot more accessible than Vinhos does.  Hope to get more plays of this in in the future.

Not getting tired of this, getting most plays online and it always is full of tough decisions.  Huge plus is that it plays REALLY well at all player counts.  They also feel different in subtle ways which is a plus in my book.  2p can be very brutal with the ability to drive actions when only 2 dice can be on one space and is very tight.  4p the guild favors get eaten up much faster.  Favors also seem like they change in value at different players counts which I like as well.

This quickly became a top game for me and doesn't appear to be going anywhere in that regard.

I just can not get over how amazing this game is. The interwoven mechanisms are no less than a gaming symphony. If you like heavy games, don't worry about the comments that may knock this game for being "overly complex". It all works together soooo well! If you do find your brain exploding, you can do two things: 

One - play more games of it. After a few, it all will likely start to come together in your head. There is a lot going on - many moving parts - but honestly, thats the very thing that makes this game so DEEP, RICH, REPLAYABLE, and REWARDING.  

TWO - Try to find someone who understands the thematic content of the game to explain it to you. Heavy games become lighter to the mind if you can understand THEMATICALLY why the game's elements are there - what you are actually doing, and why. Although on the surface this game may seem to be a "dry, themeless Euro", UNDER the surface there is an incredibly rich thematic web to EVERY part of the game. Once the thematics make sense to you, it's so much easier to remember what is what, and why. Madeira (the place) has a very interesting history, and so much of this game highlights it. 

For instance, you may move to what you call "a building" and get some bread to feed you people. Not very thematic... On the board, this building is called "Moinho". So, go there, get bread. But, Moinho is a word that means "windmill" - a building that grinds grain into flower - hence, the bread. 

You can also go to a building called the "Alfondega" which allows you to send meeples to a place on the board called "Acores". What you are really doing here is taking an action at the Customs Port (Alfondega) to send a colonist to the Azores (Portuguese volcanic islands NW of Madeira) and set up trade with the colony there. From the Azores, your colonist will get wheat, because the Azores actually had an abundance of potable water sources, along with fertile volcanic soils - great for wheat growing. You can set up a meeple in Brasil instead to get sugarcane, as Brasil provided more sugarcane than anywhere else at one time.

Having meeples in the city of Funchal gives one money because that city is the largest, and capitol city of Madeira (on the board there is a symbol for the city, but no name). If your meeples are in the city of Machico, you get wood. That may seem themeless in the game, but Machico was covered with forest at the time. 

The game is actually VERY thematic, but unfortunately that only becomes known to you if you know some of the history of Madeira. 

At any rate, I simply love this game. It is challenging, but i find it challenging in a way that does not overtax, or stress one out. 


PS - this game has also been THOROUGHLY tested for balance , and I really appreciate all the work that has gone into it to make it so perfect. The designers were also VERY active on the forums here on the geek, which is really nice to see.

Solid Euro, but boy, this is heavy. It's hard to understand how everything connects, especially as your initial bid on the characters is also selecting the actions that you're taking on the buildings below. Trying to understand the relationships is hard - I think this would take repeated plays before one really feels they have a good understanding of how best to go about getting points in a given situation. I'd like to play this a couple of more times to see what I would give regarding a rating.

This is a complex worker-placement game with all kinds of interconnected bits and pieces. The rules are actually not that difficult to understand. It's just that there are relatively a lot of them, with many options for actions, and many connections between them. Fun!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The board shows:
- several islands, divided into 5 areas, each with several regions. Each region grows a specific resource (grain, sugar, wine) although most start with stacks of wood tokens. Each area has a specific type of power; in addition, at the start of each round 4 person placards, with different powers, are randomly allocated to these areas. At the start of the game, players place 2 meeples into different regions.
- 3 city tracks, with a random distribution of people tiles; these are single-use powers
- 3 colonies, where players may send boats for powers and points
- 3 trading areas, where players send boats with goods (to earn money)
- pirate area: start the game with 2 meeples/player here. At the start of each round, roll 3 black d6 (1-3) and place the pirate dice here.

A separate action board shows n rows with several VP tokens, set up at the start of the game. At the start of each round, roll and place 3d6 (1-3) on each row.

Each round, players select a row, take those dice, and choose a tile from that row. This also sets turn order for this round, top to bottom. Then, players take turns placing one of their dice, along with a player marker, into one of the 5 areas. Areas are numbered 1-3; to place a lower numbered die, must pay 1 coin / missing pip. Players may choose to place a pirate die instead, by removing one of their meeples from the pirate area. Each area may have at most 4 dice. When you place a die, use the power of the person tile there. After all dice are placed, resolve each area in order: players with markers there may then use the powers of that area, which is stronger if you have 3+ meeples in that area. These powers are things like: buy/place ships or meeples in different areas of the board, harvest resources, acquire action tiles, etc. 

At the end of each round, pay maintenance for your ships, and food for your people (discounted according to your position on the grain track). At the end of every other round, score one of your VP tokens. The game ends after 6 rounds; most VP wins!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Holy crap, this a heavy game!  Everything in it is so elegantly crafted as well that even though it is heavy and deep and incredibly complex it still plays so smoothly.  Just consider the main crux of the game, worker placement is performed with dice.  But unlike any other dice worker placement game (i.e. Alien Frontiers, Troyes, Kingsburg) this mechanic doesn't bludgeon you with restrictions on where you can use these dice.  First of all, the dice only range from 1-3 and the number on the dice dictates how high of an action you can use for free.  If you want to use a higher action than the dice you have available then you simply need to spend a bread for each step you want to skip and bread isn't a super tight resource either.  And even still, there are 3 piracy dice available to all players for use if you don't have the one you need from your own personal pool.  So those dice, while a major part of the game, feel so gentle in their demands.  And the rest of the game goes down just as smooth, everything just a cog in this monstrosity that kills you with charm and kindness.

And for that reason I absolutely adore this game.  It is really heavy and deep and complex like I said but it is just so inviting about it that you don't feel like you're struggling to wrap your head around it.  There is this incredible balance where resources are tight enough that there's purpose to your actions but not so tight that you are stressed out with upkeep and the ability to accomplish your goals.  Don't have enough resources, that's okay, just take some piracy tokens.  The game has provided plenty of methods of getting rid of piracy after all.

I will say that because of the depth of this game I spent probably 75% of my first play just exploring what it had to offer with no real end goal in mind.  That's going to be the way most people are introduced to this game, they need to explore and get familiar with it before they can worry about competing with anybody.  But it is worth it because the game is gorgeous, fun, and very, very well designed.

RATING: 6.5
Madeira isn't the sort of heavy game that I enjoy -- its weight derives less from player interaction than from simultaneously min-maxing a dozen sources of victory points.

Thematically it's about, well, about various things happening in Madeira. Most of the points come from completing "king's request" tiles (six per player, at specific points in the game), for things like having ships in different places where ships can go, unused bonus tiles, or majorities in city tracks. In addition to the various positive options, there are several sticks -- maintenance payments of food, wood and coins that, if missed, result in pirate tokens, which can be worth substantial negative points.

The main novelty to the game is that each of the six action spaces consists of both a building (permanent) and a character (shuffles each round). When a player activates a space, they use the ability of the character immediately; in the next phase, if they also have workers deployed in the fields of the associated region, they can use the building action. Attempting to use actions efficiently, then, requires juggling not only the usual issues of ordering and limited availability, but ordering [i]combinations[/i] of actions.

It all just feels a bit like complexity for its own sake.

Compounding the problem is the very real degree of luck -- if the character actions you require fall into regions where you get the best bang for your building actions, or the right dice turn up on a track that lets you flip your guild members, excellent. If not: too bad. This would be less frustrating in a simpler game, but Madeira is a complex efficiency game. Winning or losing lies in narrow margins. It seems determined to be the worst of all worlds: difficult decisions that might not even matter.

Overwrought and uninspiring.

Very complex - potentially even too complex (too early to tell after 1 game, which we needed to stop after 3 rounds because we were running too late). Maybe it includes 1 or 2 too many mechanisms. Probably less would have been more in this case.

In addition for me there seems to be too much randomization (or even luck) involved in relation to the complexity of the game.

Great synergies and intertwined mechanisms and actions in this game. You really have to consider the whole board, the other players, as well as your short term and long term goals. Really enjoy the tough decisions this game presents. I especially enjoyed that although there's a lot going on, the rulebook is relatively well laid out and it's not the most complicated game to follow (complexity comes from the choices and decisions, not from the game being confusing). Could definitely have some trouble for those AP prone, and be a brain burner depending on who you're playing with.

Oh my! This is quite the heavy game. The rules are actually quite straight forward and not all that complex. And there's not too many small wrinkles as I expected. But with all those different game elements to closely intertwined, there is so much to take into account with every move you make. And you only have 15 moves in the whole game - with maybe some bonus pirate moves. So everything you do is of critical importance. So it's a bit of a brain burner, but it didn't bother me. It's the good kind of brain burner. And it doesn't outlast it's stay. Great stuff actually!

Madeira is often regarded as one of the most complex euros on the market. I find that 'complexity' can mean many things, and one game that I might find terribly complicated may seem easy to learn and come naturally to someone else. For me, Madeira doesn't necessarily have a complexity of rules and moving parts any more than any other heavy euro, but it can be a brain burner when it comes to working out how to efficiently manage your available actions. Trying to juggle your resource management, second phase and third phase actions, how much you are willing to pay and what you want to discount vs how greatly you need a character or building's associated actions, how many workers and boats you are willing to use or not use vs how much you will have to pay for them and the amount of piracy you are accruing - which you can willingly take.

Madeira combines elements from various different games; the 'corruption' of Lords of Waterdeep, the 'feed your people' of Agricola, elements of Stone Age like dice/resource management - all with a ramped up difficulty and combined into one game. Each choice you make will affect these elements, and even something as simple as selecting which pool of dice you want to use for a given round has a multitude of consequences; your turn order, your available characters, your overall goal (scoring tile) and your accessibility to actions on the board. This is the element of complexity that I adore about Madeira.

Picked up for around $5 on sale and initial impressions, having not played a full game yet, are that it's pretty solid. Not much different from any other euro, but there are a lot of options and the use of dice is pretty unique.

Very heavy strategy game.  I did enjoy it and would play it again (if I'm in the mood for a long / heavy game).  Personally this isn't my style.  I like lighter games but I did enjoy playing it.  First play took about 4 hrs with 40 min tutorial on how to play.  With all that said I can't see any flaws in the game play and if you want a brain burner check this out.

RATING: 7.5
A deep, complex game. Possibly the deepest of all the dice-manipulation games, which is one of my favorite genres of games. With only one play under my belt, I can't say for sure how I feel about it. But I definitely like the two-part structure to the turn sequence. Thinking about the action you want to do now, and planning how it will impact the second phase is a fun, unique puzzle, and it has heavy impact on the outcome of the game. I recommend this to anybody who wants a heavy experience, where player interaction is meaningful, and potentially dreadful to your plans. The rules are dense, but the reward seems to be there. I'm looking forward to more plays.

Finally got in a few more games, 4p schizosolo and 3p.  What a meaty game, definitely a super brain burner.  The actions themselves are not overly complex but everything you do has massive ripple effects on future game state.  

The game itself plays very well, has unique turn resolution mechanics that I've never seen before and really presents a challenge to the players.  

I really like it, but you feel like you just microwaved your brain for 2 hours when it's over.  So I doubt I play it often but there's a lot to like.

Realizing this would probably only average a play a year (after I relearn the rules) and that I could sell it for a decent profit, I let it go.

First Impression:

A working heavy euro.

All the good things I have to say about this game revolve around it's mechanisms and the great layers of strategic and tactical choices they create. It works well, and there are a lot of things you have to keep track off without the game overwhelming you. There is enough variaty both from game to game and from round to round to make the game replayable. The interaction is also fairly good, with the action cost system / pirate dice system working very well to force players reconsider their option at all times. Off all the mechanics I enjoyed the most the scoring, which was pretty well summarized with the missions with little bonus points from certain actions throught the game. (it's not a point salad)

So what's not to like in a heavy euro that works well? The usual suspect, the dry pasted theme and the nakedness of the mechanics. The game feels like playing with an algorithm, trying to be efficient for the sake of efficiency. And for a game this full with mechanics, the thematic holes are so many that completely break the theme. The patchwork of mechanics works really well, but feels really arbitary and forced together for no other reason other than adding complexity and strategic depth. Modern games have spoiled me and I can't forgive a game for being that naked from theme, even if it's a heavy well working euro. Because of that, the game outstays its welcome with me, and I'd love to play f.e. terra mystica in that much time.

I'd play again if I had to, but I can't think of several other games I would rather enjoy at the same time that scratch the same itch as this.

Madeira is a gamer's game and a brainburner.  There are five rounds and each round you only get 3 actions (represented by dice) with the opportunity to buy a couple more if you're set up for it.  There is always too much to do.  The first, third and fifth rounds are scoring rounds and part of determining turn order is choosing tiles you'll take to later score.

What I love about this game is that it is deep and thinky.  What I don't love is that it's long (at least our first play) and you can screw yourself and knock yourself out of contention to win.  I think this would be a good game if you had a group that was committed to playing it several times so that everyone knew how to play and had the strategy down... which would also help with the length.  Unfortunately I doubt it will get played that often in my group.

About [thing=95527][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=95527][/thing] is a heavy strategy game. It uses area influence (placing dice) and work placement (both workers and ships). The goal is to gain more influence (points).

For those that are familiar with the others games by Sentieiro & Soledade, you will get a very similar feeling here: few rounds (only 5), a single action per player per turn and a small number of actions (usually three each round). [thing=95527][/thing] is a very tight game, as every resource has value and is connected with something else: you want bread to feed workers and also to broad (hehe) the room for the use of dice; you want grapes to send to trade (put ships); you want wheat to trade and maybe use the mill to get more bread; you want cane to trade; you need wood to build ships, to sustain them and to get Guilds; you need money to pay for buildings, to avoid pirates and you get money by trading in the captaincies  (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo) and with the sea trade routes; you get grapes, bread, etc, by using works, which you need to feed otherwise you need to lose points or get pirates; and so on and so forth.

All the parts are connected, some stronger then others, but usually players will at least dip their toes in most, if not all, areas. The choices made have multiple levels (from choosing which die to use and where, to a pressing timming issue) and aren't, normally, done lightly.

The dice add a level of tatical readiness, as it is possible to be prepared to use them regardless of what numbers they show; or you can just swing between the areas and grap whatever you can as best as possible.

[thing=95527][/thing] is made to have a small downtime, as players do a single action on their turns, however, the sheer amount of possible actions and the necessity of having something (workers, wood, trade materials, etc) in order to make the best use of them, may induce to some deep AP - I have seen it first hand and it isn't funny, as I had time to go prepare something for the others and me to eat, came back and still wasn't my turn (and this was a three players game). This can indeed be a game that can be finished in around 75 minutes, however, it usually go to 120.

Overall, [thing=95527][/thing] offers a fulfilling experience for those looking into an euro type game, with deep strategy with tight resource management, good amount of interaction (most is blocking), high replay value and many possibilities in each turn.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players start with some money and resources and some workers on the board. Then, by turn order, they pick a set of dice to use that round, alongside a goal token (dice and goals are paired, therefore, by choosing the set of dice, you limit your choice of goals). Once everyone has done this, the placement of dice starts.

Players use a single die at a time. They can use one of their own (green) or one of the black die, but this costs a worker that is in the Fortress (the player must have a worker there in order to pay to use a black die). The dice will show numbers between 1 to 3 - this limit the area in which they can be used (the board is divided in four areas, 1 to 3, and one unnumbered, used only to gain access to wood). To use, say, a die with the number 2 in the Area 3, the player must pay one bread.

Inside the areas there are places the dice go: for instance, in the Area 3, there are the Fortress and the Crown House. But the use of that place can change, as there are tiles which went above the normal use, printed on the board - only one place is as printed on the board, per round, the others have the tile above, which players must adjust in order to make the best use. Each place can only have a maximum of three dice, and only one black die.

Once all players have passed, the second action of each location will take happen. To use them, players that went there (this is marked by a piece), must pay an amount of money ($9, in a three players game, for instance) minus the total of numbers shown on the green dice used there. For example: two players used the Mill (in Area 2), using a die showing 3 and other a 2. In a 3p game, each player must either pay $4 to use the secondary action of that spot (gaining bread) or receive a number of pirate tokens equal to the number of the black die used in the same place (if any) +1. This is done for every location, in order (the Mill will always be the first resolved, and the Fortress, the last).

After this resolution, if there is a player with more workers than anyone else in the Fortress, she can take a worker out from here and gain 4 points. Workers on the colonies produce goods. Then players must pay for things: 1 bread per worker on the board; 1 wood per ship; etc. Players must buy, or gain pirate tokens for things they don't have or can't pay.

Players score their goal tokens three times during the game: after the first round, one goal; at the end of the third, two goals; and at the end of the game, three goals. Also, the player with the most pirates loses 16 points, and second, 8 points, and so on. Finally, players trade goods they still have for money, in a 1 per 1 basis, and for every 5 money they have, they gain 1 point.

The person with the most influence (points) will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Lots and lots, all with secondary relevance. 

The most important and constant will be: which place to go. You might want to go to a location not because of the main action, but because of the secondary, which will be solved later. This can serve to block others from going there. Once you did decide which spot to place a die, you must choose a die to use. Using the lower ones, with 1 or 2 showing, first is, usually, best, as you will have more options later. However, this isn't so simple. First because places can only hold up to three dice (either three green, or two green and one black) - therefore, if you leave a place to go later, you might not even be able. Second, the amount of money you will have to pay to use the secondary action depends on the number of dice previously used in that location - the higher the numbers, the less you will need to pay. And, of course, there is the matter of using a black die (piracy) - they cost one worker from the Fortress, but basically allow you one extra action (but you don't put a marker in the place when using a black die, therefore, you won't be able to make use of the secondary action once these are done).

Once decided the place, comes the use of the location. Some allow to place or move workers and ships - workers grab goods and, in the captaincies, can also get money, bread and/or wood. Ships can net you special actions (when putting them in colonies) and money when putting them in the trade spots. Is important to decide the best places to place each of them, to get what you will need in the moment you need, and also to improve the secondary actions (the more workers in a region, the best it is); and ships are costly things to place. Other actions allow to harvest goods/wood; or trade in the captaincies; or take a Guild (paying with wood). All the uses are good, but not all will have use for you all the time. Prioritize is a must.

There is also the matter of passing: turn order can be key, not only to reach locations before they are filled up, but also because, next turn, you get to pick sooner the set of dice, and the place to get them - this is important because the spot can activate one used Guild token, and also have the goals to pick from.

Then there is the matter of paying for secondary actions or receiving pirate tokens. Is usually best to pay, as you get to do an action, but, sometimes, you simply can't and don't want to. Having just a few pirates isn't all that bad, during the game, as get rid of them is not all that hard. But they can pile up fast.

This don't even cover all the decisions you will make during play, just the most usual ones. It is not usual that the space for the decions is this big, but [thing=95527][/thing], with its long tree of choices, have plenty of them.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Rich environment for players to decide the paths they want to follow, the strategies they want to develop;
- Huge amount of decisions, all with layered relevance;
- Supposedly small downtime;
- Good amount of indirect interaction;
- Strategy mixed with tatics - there is need to adapt and plenty of ways to prepare;
- Language independent.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The amount and relevance of decisions can induce to some heavy AP;
- Lots to learn from the get go, and while the game isn't cruel, it isn't forgiven also - there is no catch up mechanic;
- Steep learning curve can make the first games be a challenge to overcome.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like trying to hold water with the hands: a good part of if will slip through. Things are constantly needed and there isn't enough time (actions) to do them all. Something will need to be left behind or delayed - even passing!

For instance, in one game, the deciding moment was one that, in many games, it doesn't matter as much: passing. The player decided to take the third spot, and send a worker to the Fortress, as he had a piracy problem to handle. This allowed other to take the second spot, and pick the set of dice and goal sooner in the next and final round. The person in third end up with a goal that he didn't make use of (Guilds), as he already had one of these and only two Guilds. If he had gone to the second spot, and choose sooner, he would have won, regardless of the actions done during the final round (he would still, for instance, be able to get rid of all his pirate tokens). Of course, this is clear in the 20/20 sight of after the game is finished. But illustrates well that every decision matter and carry weight, as everyone has only few actions, and so much that is needed.

[thing=95527][/thing] is a game with many parts that are deepely connected with others. Decision making is made harder and more meaningful due to this, yet the pacing can be quick enough for such a profund game.

[thing=95527][/thing] is a very good options for those looking for a strategic euro game mixed with tatical decisions due to the need to adjust yourself to the limitations imposed, meaning you are never too relaxed or "done" at any point: you will constantlybe on your toes, needing your best moves in order to get ahead, keep everything in place and working, avoiding the pirates and remaing watchful for opportunities. Recommended.

No need to play this again. Tries to be everything with an overly convoluted design and too many moving parts. Add some entirely unneeded randomness from dice and this is it. Even the symbols in the game are among the weakest I've ever seen, they don't make sense. All in all it simply doesn't work (opinions may vary individually). Some will likely raise this game to the heavens but I prefer some streamlining and focusing on doing a few things good rather than this failurepotpourri.

My one word for this game is PUNISHING. This feels like a negative reinforcment feedback loop. Right from turn 1, you don't have enough money, you can't get enough resources, and you won't be able to score like you want. At the very least, you can can only fix 1 of those issues before feedback and maintenance comes up on Turn 1. From there, it barely gets better. Just when you think you are doing well, you realize you forgot to save wood for ships, or you forgot to count your dudes in the keep for bread feeding. 

With all that said, it's not a bad game and I enjoyed most of what I played, but it's not one I'd seek out again. The punishment for being short on resources is NOT that bad, just a few negative VP that you can possibly negate later, but the morale effect on my psyche as I had to fail over and over again to just squeak by on a couple objectives was not a particularly fun game experience. 

I'm sure it gets easier as you learn the mechanics and I even ended up winning at the last turn in my game by cashing in 30 pts of gold, but even after a win my opinion of the game didn't improve past this rating. 

TL;DR: Decent game, some will like it a lot, but if you've ever despaired over feeding your people, avoid this one.

PS: Very AP prone due to having to do recounts and calculations frequently to figure out what's efficient for you.

Not really so much dice drafting as planning your actions way in advance and chaining them, over several turns, and managing your dice, workers, resources etc. A lot of hard, AP-inducing choices but a very good game.

This game skirts that border between heavy and complex for the sake of complexity. Once you get into a rhythm though, it plays incredibly smoothly. All of the actions are very simple to resolve, the complexity comes from the ripple effects of those simple actions. Everything is interconnected. Bad placement of workers in round one can have a crippling effect in round 3. It's tough, but it is also kind of fascinating, once you wrap your head around it.

The game does two things of note. First, it rewards players for taking the same action...which is not something you see very often in a worker placement game. Aside from being a unique take, it also creates some very interesting decisions. Do what everyone else is doing and you will have a hard time getting ahead of them, but you will be relatively safe from expense. Strike out on your own and you can corner the market on a whole lot of points, but you will also pay a fortune for it and probably lose most of what you gain to corruption.

Second, it lets you pick your own victory conditions, as you play. The vast majority of points come from demands of the crown, but you get to choose which ones to satisfy. The way these resolve puts a lot of pressure on you, as you have to satisfy one on turn 1, two on turn 3 and three on the final turn. However, since you select which ones to do, you can put in a lot of long term planning to be successful at achieving them.

It's incredibly difficult to teach (which seems to be a recurring theme in these new games coming out of Portugal) but once you get through it is an incredibly satisfying game. (Also a shared trait with its Portuguese brethren.)

Under review.

Once upon a time I rated this 9.5 at it sat atop my ranks, wearing the crown itself. Over time, though, I'm not sure of its worth to me as a game player and as a game teacher. The rules overhead is excessive, then once play commences, even without revisions, mechanising each step is time consuming. Over my several plays, it's given me a significant amount of time to consider the play dynamic and what I'm doing - what I'm getting out of it and whether it's worth the time it takes. Certainly the game performs best with 4 players, but that pushes the play-time out so much...

I don't know yet if there's a game that exists that can offer what some of these long, heavier games do but without the excessive length. To me, especially once I've mastered their systems, they feel over-long. I don't feel like I'm developing anything new or interesting in the experience any more (of-course it won't always be new). I know what I can do, I know what others can potentially do, I can extrapolate scoring permutations based on available actions and ultimately there are no surprises. For even a swift (!) two hours' investment... I feel like a game with half the rules overhead and play-length offers more. 

I feel when playing these games, to do well, we focus so much on the game systems and not so much on the actions of the players themselves - so much so that other players' actions can be easily transmuted into simply game-scripting barriers to over-come. I don't have to out-think other players to out-maneuver them in games like this, because in the end, pathing is so restricted and funneled that blocking moves are essentially hard-stops or hard-detours, it all feels extremely linear or binary - succeed or fail, progress or be blocked, etc.

Yet when I play a simple card game that is about attempting to out-play others by behaving in an unexpected manner, not only is there laughter, but there's cleverness [i]in the act of the player rather than in the mechanism of the game[/i] and that's what I feel is missing from many of these heavy games - the opportunity for the players themselves to be the game, rather than to play the designer, who is hauntingly absent.

One of the best "lots of things going on" worker placement games.  While there are lots of options, the game makes a lot of sense and flows well with just a few fiddly aspects (e.g., which workers can move from where to where).  Many ways to score points which vary during the game cause you to rethink your strategy versus simply locking in on one early in the game.  Many hard decisions.  The pirates mechanic is really good and causes you to make hard balancing decisions repeatedly.

First impression from solitaire 2p:  Wow, there is a lot of rope here to hang yourself with, but in a good, exciting way!  You get to compete against the game, in that as you progress, the game resists your progress, but there's plenty of room to compete against your opponents in this delicious title.

rating after 1 game. very complex rules and rather long playtime for what is essentially not that hard a game, so very overdressed. We played 1 rule wrong (i scored two of the same scoring tiles together for max points twice) but had i known that i prolly could have gotten a town tile for at least 10 points in the second scoring round and another 15 money tile for the last scoring round which would have gotten me 121 points instead of 134. 3 out of 4 players had no pirate tiles in the end and i scored max with all 6 of my scoring tiles (see above for our mistake).

A worker placement game about art-nouveaux architecture in Belgium.

The game lasts 5 rounds, with each round using the classic worker placement mechanism, but of cours there is a twist or two.  There are 2 regions for placement: 1) parliament- there are 4 locations here, and these actions are valuable and free, but the catch is that the person who places the most workers looses one into the court system, and it's a bit difficult to get them back into your supply.  Also, the later you place in a location, the more likely you will need to place more workers to receive the action.  It's a very interesting game of chicken. 2) the main board- this a randomized (at the start of the game) grid of the main actions of the game, where placements must be accompanied by money, with the most money in a row winning a bonus card (these cards either provide a one-off ability or provide an end-game scoring multiplier).  Also there is a point-scoring opportunity for having majorities that have been enclosed.  Essentially, there are 3 considerations to make when a making a placement(the action you want, the card you want to win, and winning a majority).  The main actions are: a) get 2 of any resources (required for building), b) build a building (scores points both in-game and end-game, manipulate the resource market, and and your building then is permanently placed on the board and you get a small special action whenever another player uses the action with your building), c)hire a patron (allows for special abilities when activated each round, but they need to be paid off at the end of the game, also used for end-game points), d)acquire a work of art (used for minor income each round if you save them and end-game points if you save them, but mainly used to sell for money and points in-game), e)sell a work of art (used fr in-game money and points, and involves an interesting market manipulation mechanic).

You also have the option to pass at any time, and the earlier you pass, the greater your chance at becoming start player the next round.  

The game scales very well from 2-5 players, it has an addictive quality to it, it's got depth and feels like a very developed Feld-like design and yet it's by a first-time designer.  Recommended.

Very good game, I like how the dummy player controlled by each player in a 2-player game can be used to mess with your opponents' plans. It requires a lot of thinking,as it is a very deep game, but I enjoy it much more than I was expecting!

*Rating based on one play.

Decent Euro game, but fell a bit flat for me, probably due to the theme and art style.  Has a nice mix of mechanics with worker placement, auctions and area control.  However, the randomness of the art tile draws was a bit of a turn-off, and I prefer my worker placement games to have a turn order track, rather than a single moveable first player marker, because then someone can't benefit from the player to their right putting in the effort to take/retain first player status.  Additionally, my one play was with 5 players, and the board felt especially tight with that many players, particularly when it came to placing buildings on the board.  I think I might enjoy it more with fewer players.

All in all, a decent game that just didn't draw me in.

This game has a very distinct artistic look to it. Which is to be expected as it was illustrated by the same artist that did Troyes. Another really pretty game with a distinctive look. This is the only thing Bruxelles has in common with Troyes. The designers are different as are the objectives. It is primarily a worker placement/action drafting game with some auction and market mechanics worked into the mix. The configuration is interesting because it feels like a collection of modular boards each comprising a sort of mini game within an overall larger game. There are two areas to draft actions and the rules of exclusion and blocking are different for each. One requires you to spend more workers to take actions and the other utilizes money and a neat L shaped component that literally allows a player to carve out specific parts of the board as "allowed" to be used in a given round. The theme is sort of there under the considerable layer of mechanics. I mean, you are trying to make a master piece of art and also sell your works of art on a market so the actions do all relate to that goal in one way or another. I tend to get love or hate for this game when I bring it out so while I like it I find I have to be careful who I ask to play it with. At the end of the day, the game has a lot of familiar mechanics presented and executed in unfamiliar ways or with slight tweaks that make the game as distinct mechanically as it is artistically. just like art however, this is pretty subjective. Play with caution.

Abstract:
A worker placement game with an art nouveau theme that could be done by Stefan Feld. It has a lot of different intertwined mechanisms. Each worker spot has multiple functions: the action, used for area marjority, and bidding for cards at the bottom track.
There is quite a lot of player interaction by bidding and the innovative stock market. 
Additionally, each player can build buildings on a own player board.

Thoughts:
Great euro game which requires some thinking. The multiple use of worker spots is quite unique. Bruxelles is not easy to teach due to the many intertwined mechanisms.

In some ways, this is peak euro. So many systems that it would make a new gamer's head explode. It ultimately isn't all that complicated, but it does seem that there are multiple paths to victory. Action selection in particular is tricky because of the auction AND the area control that happen ON TOP of the action you take. If you like this type of game you're gonna love it, but will come across as overwrought for many, I'm sure.

Nice eurogame with a good mix of various mechanics. Players gather materials, build buildings, collect and sell works of art, enlist some famous people, and sent their workers on dark dealings where some of them get caught by the police. 

I like the main mechanic, it is worker placement plus bidding plus area control, all in one. I also like the artwork because I think it suits the time period that the game takes place.

On the other hand because of the complextity, you will need some plays to fully understand how everything comes together.

The game seems a little intimidating at first glance thanks to the look for the board and the look of the rule book. Once you get playing though, things become very easy to understand as all of the actions fit together very nicely and nothing seems to exist simply for the sake of having more things to do in the game. There are a lot of tough decisions to make; the board is fairly tight and you're constantly struggling to do what you need to do while trying to deny your opponent what they need. Wonderful and slightly vicious game.

One of the most exquisite Euro designs I've ever encountered, and also one of the best worker placements. There is so much going on with this board, how the icons interact with one another, and it's all incredibly interesting, from the Stock Exchange phase where you place the bracket tile to open up a field of actions you can take, to the 'worskhop' cursor you move around when selling a Work of Art. Many choices, many variables with which to score or lose VP from the personages you choose, or the Bonus Cards you place. Unbelievable game here, and both the Alexandre Roche artwork and the layout and mechanics of the game itself brilliantly mirror the Art Nouveau theme.

11/10/17:  This is a very pretty as well as fun game.   The cover alone should guarantee selling many copies.  Unfortunately for us it has its lumps. I'd call this a very solid euro, but not one that is in my mind truly outstanding.

Like Puerto Rico, your success seems very dependent on what the person to your right does.  Another big problem with this game that our game group seems to have is the issue of being the penultimate player selecting a in a column.  You may be giving easy points and the ability to grab the card to the person to your left.  Whomever gets to close out a column often gets handed a gift. The strategy of maxing out your buildings seems to be very strong.

The rulebook seems to suffer from a somewhat common problem that occurs when it is written in one language and then translated into a second language.  This results in the rulebook not being as precise as it could be, with ambiguities in the wording  Fortunately the publisher has offered clarifications on BGG.

The artwork on the right edge of the personal scoring board is way too small.  For me it's unreadable unless I put on glasses and peer at it closely.  Not a problem if you've played the game several times, but a big usability issue when you're learning the game.

3.5 hours including instruction for my first game with 5 players (2 first time players). 30 minutes instruction, 3 hours playing.

12/1/16: Reprint should be on the way.

Több játék mechanizmusa vegyül ebben a játékban (is). Manapság kevés játékról mondható el ennek az ellenkezője. 
Caylus, Diamonds Club, Hermagor egy-egy mechanizmusa felsejlik ebben a fix 5 körös, nagyon szépen megrajzolt játékban. Azonban néhány eredeti ötlet is biztosítja a újdonságot. (építési szükségletek meghatározása, festmények értékei, személykártyák használhatósága, egy adott fordulóban a játéktér definiálása, stb.)
Nagyszerű szórakozást nyújtó, kezdőkkel nem javasolt, nagy újrajátszást biztosító, sok egyedi ötletet tartalmazó, elfogadható játékidőt igénylő, gyönyörűen kivitelezett játékot ismertem meg.

Looks absolutely beautiful, although there is a lot of information on the board.  Place your workers for many different possible actions, and score points for many different things.  There a few mechanisms that are certainly very original: the reward for the art, the importance of geometry when placing your workers, or the allowed area for placing them.
For some reason, even though I'm ussually not very smart to get this kind of "salad" game, I could understand and enjoyed the game.  Did not feel long even with 5 players.

An excellent euro mechanic, that could reach perfection with some more fine tuning. I play the compensation variant for the auction (non-winners get their money back minus one for each position they occupy). Obviously gallerist has the same theme, the feel is also similar, though gallerist feels heavier.

Bruxelles 1893 is a bit heavier than your typical medium weight worker placement euro. There are lots of interwoven mechanics, but everything rapidly falls into place even during the first play and overall it flows very smoothly.

It only lasts 5 turns, and playtime of 25 min per player stated on the box is quite accurate.

There are two boards.

In the art nouveau board (or, better, in the sub-section of that board actually used in each turn) players compete for action spaces to gather resources, attract personalities, produce and sell works of art, build buildings (and when they build, they permanently cover action spaces with own buildings, thus gaining free actions as other players occupy those spaces).
But in the art nouveau board players also compete with an auction-like mechanic to collect bonus cards (placed under each column of spaces). This is the only part of the game that feels fragile: last player to put a meeple on each column usually can easily overbid and win the bonus card, so being last in turn order seem definitely better.

In the Bruxelles board there are just 4 action spaces: these have more flexible actions, and are not exclusive.
The interesting twist in this board is that the player with more meeples placed there has one of them arrested and loses it until he can get it out of prison.

In Bruxelles 1893 there is much variability (both during setup and gameplay), with a bit of randomness but almost no luck.

There is much to like in this game, and many approaches to victory points: during the first play players start to "see" things they would try differently in subsequent sessions.

Very eager to play again.

This one is tough to rate. It's a point salad that has been tossed in the kitchen sink, but it works. There are different avenues to try; the various sub-systems show their interconnection as the game moves on; and the decisions leave you feeling satisfied. The arc throughout the game is weaker than I would prefer. You perform similar analytical processes during each of the five rounds.

At 2 or 3 players, the various strategic paths provide similar volumes of points; thus, any differences between the strategic paths are a bit illusory. Instead of art selling or building being the difference in scoring, I've found the winner is typically who collected the most bonus tiles. This results in the game play within each round bordering on being too tactical. Each round finds the players jockeying for those bonus tiles. After the final scoring, you don't feel a win is due to clever play and more a function of who did best at a tic-tac-toe-style side game. I've not played with 4 players, but positioning for those bonus tiles is probably more difficult/uncontrollable at 4.

Every time I take the sell action, the thought that I could be playing The Gallerist instead crosses my mind. Also, this could be much improved by a player aid.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once as a 3-player game.  The taking of action spaces worked pretty well, but the bidding for cards and building bonuses are suspect.  The bonus cards are basically multipliers that everyone wants to win or deny someone else from winning.  Winning/losing these cards was subject to player chaos.  I dislike that the middle space is available as a building bonus, especially since this space is always in play.

Really solid euro with lots of interesting choices every turn. Every turn comes down to an internal conflict between the most opportunistic choice and advancing your long-term strategy. After 4 games with lower player counts, I'm beginning to realize that I've played the same general strategy every game. Not sure if I'm missing other valid choices, but I keep winning, so I'm disinclined to deviate. Not sure if that will end up killing the long-term replayability or not.

After a rather long learning, the game runs pretty well. It is clearly not for beginners.

It offers several areas of development: arts, construction, noble. And different mechanisms are present in the game: laying worker, two types of majority.

It takes a while to absorb this game. At first glance, the graphic design is a bit busy and the art style isn't to everyone's liking. I would consider this game to be pretty heavy and take multiple plays before you can start to develop a strategy. I think the game is quite brilliant in what it accomplishes. There are many things to consider each turn and the choices are so intricately linked. My only concern is the building options may be too strong compared to other strategies.

I enjoy this game. At its heart it is just a simple worker placement game, but each worker placement carries a lot of weight with multiple things to consider: what bonus card to bid for, how much to bid, what actions are available, what actions do your opponents want, what will help your area majority, what bruxelles actions to take, will you lose a worker, etc. It might start to feel a little bit too repetitive with a lot of repeat plays back to back, but we play it few and far between and find those plays fun.

Read the rules... Looks like an interesting twist on Worker Placement.  Two boards - one where bidding high gives you a chance to win an bonus card.  Both cost extra workers to place where someone else already has.  Also, each round a player chooses a subset of the actions that are available.  The rest looked pretty standard.  Get resources, spend resources to build buildings or get special power cards, use powers, etc., etc..  The costs to build buildings is changeable though and player influenced and what buildings you can turn in is also player influenced.  All-in-all, it looks likes it's got some new twists and would be interesting, but I can't get excited about playing it.  One to play, but probably not own.

juego de colocación de trabajadores con una original mecánica de selección de acciones. En cada turno, se saca una carta que determina unas coordenadas sobre una matriz de acciones. El jugador debe colocar una frontera en esas coordenadas, que reducirá la superficie donde se pueden colocar los trabajadores. 

Se pueden sumar puntos por muchas cosas. El juego tiene tres tracks que actuan como multiplicadores. Bastante sesudo. 

A los jugones les encantará. a los que no estén iniciados en los juegos de mesa, les parecerá un quebradero de cabeza.

Me lo regaló por sorpresa Marc en mi cumpleaños en 2014. Se lo encargó a Dionisio, que me lo dió en una sesión en el BdC. Se ha convertido en algo muy valioso para mí.

The rules are difficult to grok because they seem disjointed, but it all makes sense after a few turns. The beauty lies in the multiple strategies available. All are  viable and well-balanced.

Alexandre Roche's artwork fits the theme like a glove. All in all, this is an excellent eurogame that stands on an equal footing with Troyes and Ginkgopolis. Highly recommended.

A well-designed moderate euro with a whiff of theme. As a "point salad" game, it takes a few sessions to understand the leverage of each move.

A very smart game.  Worker Placement, tableau building, positional elements, point salad... Just a lot going on at once.   Reminds me of a Feld or a Steading.   Gorgeous game.

RATING: 8
One of the weirdest games I own. "Wonky" would be putting it mildly. The theme is bizarre, the mechanics are ridiculous, and yet the whole thing kind of comes together in a fascinating way. 

No amount of creative justification can try to explain how the theme has anything to do with the mechanics. This is point salad to a tee. Make weird area majorities with workers placed spatially around a symbol. Make bids in columns with coins that accompany your workers. Sell artwork based on the arbitrary position of a block of color in an orange square. Build a building according to the changing resources depicted on a clock. Tuck cards under your player board for extra points, and then multiply them according to an arbitrary track.

Whatever, just play it, it's great!

Having only played it online (multiple plays), I'm looking forward to playing it with a physical copy. I think it's a really smart euro with plenty to consider.

Probably multiple paths to victory though I generally seem to go for one (construction) more than the others, and never for another (pieces of work).

Goodness me, but what a lot there is going on in this game; that it all meshes well instead of grinding horribly is a real tribute to a well tested design. A real gamers game then, with lots to think about - if I'd had to guess I'd have taken it for a Feld; which is a compliment - and a nice bonus for those who know Bruxelles/Brussells with well known city buildings - from the Palace down to the Grand Place - appearing on the board and the player mats.

RATING: 7.7
Played a 5 players game.
Bruxelles a classical worker placement game which combines 3 more considerations with the placement on the board : column bidding for cards, area majority and caylus-like buildings bonus.

The game is very fiddly, quite complex and extremely interactive which is very original for that kind of games.

The VP sources are very well balanced, but the turn order tie can be very frustrating for the last players (which is worst in a 5-players game). The placement of the last worker on a column, which looks like a "forced" action creates the same kind of feeling.

A very good game indeed.

The designer was definitely doing his best Stefan Feld impersonation here, as I would have sworn this was a Feld game if I didn't know better.  And this designer's Feld impersonation is exceedingly good!

In Bruxelles, there are a ton of options to score points, many of which mesh together extremely cleverly.  For example, you'll need to place workers on a grid to take actions, but the column you place in really matters, as you're simultaneously vying for majority in a column.  And on top of that, the intersection of any group of four spaces of the grid is scored for area majority!  So, you're always fighting the decision of "I really want to take this action" versus "I really want to win that column" versus "I need to win the points for that node".  And when the three match up, it is glorious!

There are also some other super clever mechanisms here, such as a cool market mechanism as well as a super cool mechanism to limit the available play space on the board each game round.

Overall, there is just so much awesomeness going on here!  Extreme kudos to this first time designer, and I hope there is more to come!

Bruxelles 1893 was more-or-less what I expected from the crew that brought us 
Troyes. The game is rather abstract, and the mechanisms are somewhat disconnected. It's nothing you wouldn't expect from a first-time designer - a few elements here or there could likely have been refined - and overall the game appealed to me much more than most of this year's dry, solitary Eurogames (*cough*Concordia*cough*). There is a lot of engagement with other players, and plenty of room for pursuing a deeply specialized strategy.

Comment on first play:  I think what ruins this game for me is that I don't think the strategic paths are all that balanced. Whomever gets the juiciest spot in the middle of the board to build on (earliest) will accumulate so many bonuses that I can't imagine anybody catching them with any other method. I certainly can't imagine anybody winning without building. Thus, it becomes a tactical competition where the start player in the first round has a huge leg up. I also feel that the remaining actions (aside from getting resources and building) are slow and don't really amount to much.  The personages are also not balanced.  The ones that increase your multiplier (the building one is very good) are so much stronger than the others that the cost is really negligible.  It would be fine if these didn't refill randomly, but since they do, they can stagnate until somebody bites the bullet.  I had the feeling that a large portion of the game was not setting up the player who was after you in turn order.  It seemed that whomever got the most advantages by dumb luck or bad moves by the player on their right was going to win.  

Consider these things...1. The start player is guaranteed 2 resources on their first move. 2. The start player is guaranteed to build first if they choose, and if the build action spot is in the center, it will be empty for building. 3. The start player is the only one who knows for certain how much building their first building will cost, while everyone else has to guess. 4. If you take a person, you may be giving the player to the right a great person at only 3 dollars. 5. The start player is the person least likely to lose their meeples to City Hall, since they will be playing meeples earlier to actions at cheaper costs. 6. The start player will make more points in the symbol/neighborhood scoring because they will likely have gotten more of the meeples to the board, thus they will have a slight advantage in winning cards at the bottom of the board.  From there, it seems that things tend to snowball...

I think what would fix this game for me is if 1. the framing nonsense were just removed and the board was shrunk to a 4x4 board permanently.  It is just an element that randomly disenfranchises people who have to build on the edges of the board. 2. If the persons didn't refill and they were a flat cost...you decided to build, well I decide to take these juicy persons...give people a reason to choose an alternate strategic path. 3. The clock and the painting board just make the game a table-random mess.  You can't plan anything towards them...you just have to get lucky...that is not good design. 4. Give different starting money a la Caylus based on turn order in the first round.

Basically, if you take out the fluff, you end up with a game very similar to Spyrium, which in my opinion, is a much better game.

RATING: 5.5
Now, okay, the following is obviously my personal opinion based on just a single play in which we were 5 new players who had never played the game before – that’s probably not optimal, so do take the following with a grain of salt… And the game did take 2½-3 hours or so which is way longer than it should, based on what it offers. We didn’t really have any clue as to which strategy was the best, but based on my play the building bonus seemed huge; 60 points is quite a lot, and the winner and the runner-up were the players who had pursued this strategy… 

The other bonus points seemed inferior, and yes, the other strategies mean that you probably get more points during the game, but the building bonus seemed too big. Also, the winner probably won because he got to be starting player a lot during the game, which meant that he could decide how ”the arch” (don’t know the name for it) should be placed each round. And in every single round, it was placed in the coordinates 1.4 as it meant his buildings were always available while especially my buildings never got activated… Yes, I guess I could have passed beforehand, but that would mean I would have to forego a lot of actions in order to be starting player (and it still wouldn’t even be a given that you become the starting player if you pass first; the probability just increases). This left a sour taste in my mouth as he got tons of second action rewards (while other got unlucky and had placed their buildings in such a way that they didn’t get activated). Oh, and he was also the only one to build on two of the “building” actions; and those were used all the time as buildings are great as they give you second abilities… 

Yes, I do admit that my opinion of the game might be lower than it should due to poor play and no overall understanding of the various interlocking mechanics (which is neat) and bonus points etc. I would like to try it with 3 as it should be much faster, and it will be much easier to plan ahead as only 2 as opposed to 4 players can change the outcome during the game). I always like different paths to victory, and there certainly are many mechanics and a lot to think about in this game, so while my initial rating is quite low (and I almost never radically change my mind and therefore rating about games), I’m very willing to try it again.

Another typical euro game. Everyone plays their own game, builds an engine and away we go. There was some decent interaction in this game, but this was mainly around discussion about how to peg back the runaway leader. All to no avail. 

There are a good combination of different mechanics in this game and I would play again. 

The game had no catch up mechanism, the theme is weak, and the artwork and components are average.

Wow. Very impressive on first play. Tons of variety. Lots of options to try. A bit of vp salad, but the main one is constructing buildings. There's tons of randomness, but not too much luck. Only significant luck is color of works you get. But that's not a huge deal. What's really nice is that the game systems are all nicely interlocked. There are pros and cons to everything. It does have the potential to bring out the AP in those prone to such things, but there isn't an explosion of choices, or too much to calculate, so it seems manageable. Played with 4. Seems like the sweet spot.

Back when Bruxelles came out Pearl Games was a Hot Publisher With A Small Essen Presence, so you could count on their booth to be packed more tightly than sardines in a tin can from 9:00 to 19:30. My partner has a thing for arty designs, and so wanted to play this game, but there was simply no opportunity to do so. After that it turned up on a few occasions but was always pre-empted by other games, and from then on slowly faded away from our radar. Until the other day.

Bruxelles is a friendly worker placement game with a standard worker core and several elaborate, quite gimmicky mechanisms to generate the various sources of VPs. The most egregious example is the central tile determining the sales value of a work of art: how that evolved into being is beyond me, really. I don't understand what purpose it serves too, as it promotes works of art being 'cycled around' from corner to corner. Why not simplify it to that idea...?! Anyhow, the amount of workers remains fairly constant throughout the game: nice special actions put you in risk of semi-permanently losing a worker; and if you have lots of free workers you will usually not have enough cash to put them to good use for long. Also important of course is to stick with your chosen VP path as these things tend to grow in power over time; obviously this is going to be way more difficult when more and more players are competing to the point where I think the game becomes too tactical. There's too much multiplexing going on too, with most actions having consequences elsewhere in not quite-so-logical areas. At the low end of the player scale you can sometimes avoid these programmed non-zero-sum presents, but that is no longer the case at the high end. Perhaps it pans out, but I'm not a fan of these overt presents, as players tend to avoid them. Non-zero-sumness should be subtle yet persistent. But that's why my name is not on the box.

All in all: if you like worker placement titles this is a title you should take a look at at some point; and even though I'm not a fan of the mechanism I'm happy I finally got a chance to put the design through its paces. Still I wonder about the design's longevity.

RATING: 7
I'm split on this one. The worker-placement decisions were great to consider; they have something like 5 different factors involved, and I enjoyed trying to balance those. Also, vastly different approaches seem viable, yet it's possible to score poorly. But my one play took about 3 hours, and unlike some games, I didn't feel the time zipping by. (We were all playing for the first time, which I'm sure didn't help!)

If this game played reliably in 75-90 minutes, I'd probably rate it an 8. At the pacing it had that one time, I'd probably rate it a 5. I'd enjoy trying it 3p; in addition to time considerations I feel like that would make the town actions a bit tighter, which I suspect I'd like.

Solid, heavy worker placement
Player interaction high level
Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.

RATING: 7.5
Have only played two and three player, really need to play with 4 and five.  I get the feeling that this game really shines with competitive, cut throat players.  It's very interactive for a Euro, and your decisions can often be whats good for you vs. what will screw over or at least deter or limit the other players.  The variety of mechanics are really fun and refreshing, and the art is great, so it has an aesthetic, tactile quality above and beyond other "soulless euros" (which are my favorite kind of game fyi and I don't demand much from a theme).  Really want to explore this more, and I think the more players, the much more dynamic it becomes, which is a great testament to the importance of player interaction on this games' strategy.  My two negatives  would be it has had strong potential in my few plays for a runaway leader to emerge, especially if someone locks up many workers at the courthouse and fails to win the auctions for cards, that player's situation can become pretty poor.  Also there isn't a strong sense of accomplishment.  You are placing your 6 building tiles to "build" your building, but it doesn't feel too special, and there's less "look what I did" feeling at the end of the game compared to others imho.

In Bruxelles is elke speler een 19e eeuwse architect en ontwerpt een gebouw in de Art Nouveau stijl.

Elke beurt kan een speler één van zijn poppetjes inzetten om een actie te doen. Niet alle acties op het “Art-Nouveau-bord” (rechts) zijn altijd beschikbaar, en dat is elk spel verschillend. Je kan kunstwerken maken die je later weer kan verkopen voor geld/punten. Je kan ook ‘bouwblokjes’ ophalen die je later kan gebruiken om te bouwen. De acties op het “Bruxelles-bord” zijn altijd beschikbaar, maar daar riskeer je een poppetje kwijt te geraken: diegene die op het einde van de ronde de meeste poppetjes op dat bord heeft staan verliest er één.

Daarnaast is het ook nog belangrijk waar je je poppetje zet voor een actie! Je kan er namelijk geld onder leggen, en op het einde van de ronde wordt per kolom gecontroleerd wie het meeste geld heeft betaald. Diegene wordt beloond met een kaart die verschillende voordelen geeft. Ook elk wapenschild wordt gecontroleerd : diegene die de meeste poppetjes rond een wapenschild heeft staan krijgt een aantal punten!

Eén ronde is gedaan wanneer iedereen gepast heeft (meestal wanneer je poppetjes op zijn). Er worden 5 ronden gespeeld.

Worker placement conversion into VP salad.  Common mechanic, but an enjoyable game that presents you with interesting decisions.  I don't think I'd run out to buy it due to the high price tag, but I'm eager to play it again (via someone else's copy).  Got a laugh at the rule "the person with the most piss-boys points gets to go first".  Probably will get some strange looks from other tables when you ask, "Who has the most piss boy points?"

Tempted to drop this a notch or two after a 5er game, but will keep it steady for now.  Do not play this game with 5.  It is significantly better with 4.  The lack of control and downtime are much worse.

An absolutely beautifully designed game. It is a worker placement game but with auctioning weaved into it and other creative elements that increase the theme and make the game better in every way. This is an amazing example of how games are not just about the one mechanic but can become rich by combining mechanics together to form a very  rich and flawless game. It is quite a treat to play. There are many choices that are important in the game but yet you can see a clear path without being bogged down with too many finicky mechanics.

A kitchen sink Euro themed around the art Nouveau movement in late 19th century Brussells.  If you can get on board with that, and don't mind a meaty Euro, then you could do a lot worse than this one.  I enjoyed it - lots to do, lots of options, and tight game play.

An interesting, multi-stage action selection game where the biggest wrinkle is the ever-changing cost of building a house.

Terrific game which has the hallmarks of a great Feld game.  The board and theme work well together and all the interesting mechanisms gel perfectly.  Some have called this a bunch of disparate non-thematic mechanisms with little to hold it together. I strongly disagree.  Thematically it feels good.  You can be creating art, playing the supply and demand of the art world, building buildings, and enlisting the powerful men of Brussels who help you along your way.  Admittedly theme isn't the strong point of the game, but it's there.  Where the game really shines is how everything fits so neatly together.  Where you place your 'assistant' in order to get to do an action matters a lot as it impacts on further benefits you are bidding for which is dependent on the column you are in,  and the points you score, which is dependent on you getting a majority of 'assistants' in each city area.  Very clever stuff indeed.  On top of that you have an ingenious art market and a clever building cost mechanism.  And it all interrelates with itself beautifully.  If you like games such as Bora Bora, Tzolk'in, Trajan and the like then you are going to enjoy this.  Big time.

Initial thoughts:
For about a year the board has put me off to this game. Then one day, the board looked appealing and the gameplay has been even more rewarding. Scoring big chunks seems to revolve around building (well you are architects after all), however setting up your end game scoring on the other tracks and tucked cards has made this game a fun one to come back to. The worker placement element of this game is a bit of a brain burner too...and if you're not careful you can get completely screwed. I like that!

Improving my rating from 7 to 8 after several plays on boiteajeux. With more plays the importance of the actions and auction really reveals itself.

initial rating for 2 &3er... 
the downside is there may not be enough scoring constrains as it was easy to get to the tops of all the levels.

i suspect it may be best as a 3 player, but this is just conjecture as the art nouveau board does scale with the number of players.

only thing holding back rating it a 9 is the possibility that there is a dominant strategy. (builder/buildings)

raised to 9 after a 4 player game, as the game scaled very well at 4 and i now may think it plays best at 4 (different game experience too) and won with a different strategy.

I constantly feel like this game makes every action/choice have to be considered in many different ways. In phase A, how you set the protractor-thing determines what actions are available, who's houses can get secondary benefits, and what cards are being auctioned. In phase B, when you're placing workers you have to think of it in many ways: should I place on the main game board or the row/column board, if I place on the board with the row/columns: what action am I getting, how much should I bid for the card in the column, will this worker allow me to get a majority on a crest, is this action worth giving my opponent a secondary action? The actions themselves sometimes have decisions to make: will I use and keep this character for future use or discard him for a one-time-use so I don't have to pay at the end? Even when you win bonus cards, do you want to use it for it's bonus or add it as a multiplier for one of the end game scoring mechanisms? Will I sell art for a quick money and/or VP bonus, or keep it for a money bonus when passing/market control/VP for a certain bonus secondary actions? Despite how complex this all sounds, Bruxelles is not an overly hard game to learn or teach. It also takes less time than you might expect (being that there are only 5 rounds). It does have a lot of interesting decision and there is a good mixture of long-term strategies and short-term tactics. The only thing that really worries me is that it seems like it will feel kind of samey after 5-ish plays.

Wow, I've been shocked by how great this game is and how much I love it.  On the surface it is worker placement, but there is also auctioning, role selection, area majority, and  market manipulation.  Each turn is important and it offers a lot if different choices and there are multiple paths to victory!  Fantastic game whose style grows on you like a life-giving symbiot.  The replayability is through the roof since the placement areas, stick market, and building requirements are always changing and manipulatable.  Plus the game goes by really fast so it definitely won't overstay it's welcome and really forces you to think end game the entire time.  Fantastic game with a ton of depth that, when players know it, is played in under an hour!

This here is a euro-y mishmash of different mechanisms bolted together and not supported by much (if any) thematic integration. What is the artwork price mechanism representing? Why do workers who go to Brussels end up in court?  Who cares, I like it. On paper, it sounds like it shouldn’t work, but all the mechanisms work for me in delightful ways, frequently offering interesting lady-or-the-loot choices. 

-	When you place workers you must accompany them with a bid. At round end, the highest bidder of each column wins a bonus card. Whoever wins that card can use its ability (get workers out of court, boost powers, etc.) or save it for an endgame VP multiplier. 
-	Also at round end, you score points based on area majorities for where workers are placed.
-	When you purchase a bonus card ally, you get his ability immediately and can keep him for the rest of the game or dump him. The catch is that at the end of the game, you must pay his cost or else lose 5VPs (which is a lot). 
-	White cubes are easy to come by in order for building, but if use them to build you won’t get the 5VP bonus for using “noble” materials. 
-	There’s a separate board for powerful actions where you can spend workers, but whoever places the most there on a turn must send a worker to court, losing that worker until he wins an end-of-round card that brings him back. 
-       Buildings go on action spaces and give the owner a Caylus-like secondary benefit which impacts future placement decisions by opponents. 

It distinguishes itself from being yet another worker placement game by how you need to play off each other. Your decisions to place workers + accompanying bid, place on the Brussels board, and rotate the building materials “clock” are all made in light of your opponents. Points are generally to be had via two primary ways plus squeezing extras out using bonus cards and "noble" materials. 

Make no mistake, it can be brutal (you might have some turns where you pass earlier than you'd like), but that’s what you want in a good w-p game. It takes about all of 20 minutes to explain yet it has very rich decisions. I think it’s a winner for medium-weight w-p game with something unique to it (see also Snowdonia) and it earns a spot in my collection as such.

The game all works together just fine, but I felt a huge disconnect between the theme and all its various mechanisms -- it was a very dry, very mechanical Euro game. Lots of rules, bits, tracks, dials, spots, and boards to keep track of with no thematic glue as to why.

What a "pearl" of a game! ...
On of the finest worker placement games currently available and unfortunately it seems a lot of people is missing this in accordance to nearly no "presentation" or less word-of-mouth recommendation, here is mine: Buy this game if you like Eurogames and worker placement games, you will not regret. All the little pieces of gameplay fits perfect together and the content is fine.

Only a small add from my side, I have written by myself the names of the places and areas onto the game gameboard, handwritten looks fine, not nearly necessary if you play this one a second time but helpful in the beginning or for first-players to know the places noticed from the rules. Will add a picture from the board in my gallery soon.

Worker Placement/Engine builder style game.
I love that where you place your workers has 3 different effects (action, cards and majority). I also love the black market, where you have strong actions, but may lose workers when doing so.
You get an engine builder feeling in the game, too, both on actions and victory points.
All in all a great experience, where you feel that you want to try different strategies the next time you play.

This is one of those games where one action will have several different effects. The worker placement grid is quite genius as you are basically doing 4 things with one worker.

This game looks like it should be complex but it is quite easy to learn. It's like a Vital game that was extremely streamlined.

Only negative I have about the game is that it feels a little bit like a point salad. Still an amazing game though and one will gladly play any time.

RATING: 9
This is not an innovative and over-thematic game (i expected more theme integration even if the character cards's powers are sounding relative to their corresponding real people --Georges Brugmann was a banker and a philanthropist, Ernest Solvay was a Belgian chemist and industrialist, hence his power to earn or transform a material....) but there is interesting things put into it. The artwork and components are really engaging.

After reading the rules, i was afraid of a lack of coherence but after the first turn, it plays very smoothly.

Several sources of points in the game :
- constructing your building (100 VP max). There is an ever changing cost to build one stage of your building (there is 6 stages). So you will have to plan ahead and look at what your opponents can build and when in order to not be screwed. Because, as soon as a player build a stage, the compass is moved, changing the required resources to build.

- exhibit works of art. There is an insteresting cursor mechanism to change/fix how one can earn VP/coins. The more you create works of art, the more you can influence and move the cursor at your own advantage.

- majorities on Art Nouveau board. This requires to progress on City Hall track. At the end of a turn, all coat of arms surrounded by 4 meeples will earn VP to the player(s) with the most meeples. You earn what it is mentionned on the City Hall track square your disc is on.

- 4 end game scoring : number of remaining works of art, number of characters, number of meeples and money. Along the course of the game, you will earn bonus cards (each column on the Art Nouveau board rewards a bonus card to the player with the most bid). You can use it straight away to earn an instant bonus (progression on a track, an additionnal meeple....) OR put it under your building in order to boost 1 of the 4 end game scoring, encouraging long term planning (very risky given the amount of opportunities to be screwed by your opponents).

There is jockeying everywhere in this game. This is what it makes it enjoyable to me.
-----
EDIT :
4 plays so far (3 and 2 players) and i am impressed by this design. All mechanics are smoothly integrated into the game. It is a worker placement with a twist : auction/bidding but with a very clever implementation.

This a tense and short game (the 25 min/player on the box is accurate) with interesting decisions. Opportunities to screw your opponents are legion :
- on building (moving the compas before everyone else)
- on exhibiting work or art (moving the 5 colours cursor)
- on approaching a character
- on placing a worker on the Art Nouveau board : not only for the action itself but also regarding majorities and auction for bonus card
- on placing workers on the Bruxelles board : not only for the powerful action but also to increase the cost in meeple for other players but also to temporize

I really enjoy how the worker placement are implemented on the 2 different boards. Love it.

Bruxelles is another showcase for that growing segment of games where less would have been more. It's not that the game doesn't work, or that some of the mechanisms employed don't work (possibly with the exception of the market price indicator but even that isn't truly broken). No, the problem is rather more simple than that, and it is twofold:

First, the game incorporates quite a few different mechanisms. That in itself might not indicate a problem per se but it becomes one if many of them lack coherence and give the impression that they have been included primarily for the sake of including a clever mechanism and the game does not benefit from it otherwise because those mechanisms simply have little connection with anything else in the game. They could have been left out easily with no ill effects. The second issue is related to the abundance of different moving parts as well. There is a large rules overhead. At its heart, Bruxelles is not a particularly complex or fiddly game but it is easy to get that impression because there are lots of little rules with a rather weak theme binding. Once you have understood how the game works they mostly make sense and you will probably be able to tell what real world equivalent a particular action is meant to represent but it just doesn't work the other way around. The actions are not intuitive or self-evident which creates a very abstract feel. If you guessed what game effects, say, the "sell art" action has you would get at most half of it right.

I am so excited to own this game right now. I purchased it in 2015. My only worry is that it is so intricate I might have a hard time teaching it to new players. It's a point casserole game instead of a point salad game, in that all the ways to score are much more related to one another. I've been hesitant to bust out my own copy but I've had a blast playing a couple games with my friends.

The meeples have top hats. I was thinking the other week, "there is a game where the meeples are dressed appropriately for their era," and then I remembered that this was that game and that I owned it. The rest of the artwork is incredible as well. 

My rating might go up.

Ein Architekteneinsetzspiel, überbordend verzahnt und in ein erfrischendes, bildungsbürgerliches Thema gegossen. Jugendstil als Brettspiel, Art Nouveau als Art Direction. Liebe bei allem, wo das Auge des Schöngeists mitspielt. Hat man das zu Beginn überladen wirkende Mechanismenkonglomerat aus einigen wirklich hübschen Ideen erst einmal  verinnerlicht, spielt sich BRUXELLES überraschend zügig, eloquent, variabel und interaktiv: so manchem Zug liegen taktische Überlegungen zugrunde, die der Dynamik der einzelnen Partie und die Strategie der Mitspieler berücksichtigen. Perfekt. Daraus wird ein Lieblingsspiel.

Here is a point salad game, quite Feld-like in its execution, but has very interesting bits and it comes together in an intriguing way. The auction board that functions as an action board, bonus action board, and auction board for one-time powers is nifty. And then... those one-time power cards also double as long-range VP cards if you so choose to use them for that purpose instead. Every aspect of the game has at least two purposes, and that makes this a rather deep Euro game. The theme is not entirely connected to the mechanics, but the fact that the theme is fresh takes the sting out of the disjointedness. And with all these saturated mechanics, the game is still rather easily to learn (though I had no idea what I was doing when I started, which is typical for a game like this). My problems with the game lie in two areas: the point system is dependent on several mechanics to make it run efficiently, and I believe because of its design this system is somewhat obscure to new users. My second issue is the co-dependency of several key mechanics, all of which are extremely tied to money. Money in this game is power, and if you have not figured out a way to generate enough of it to keep up with your opponents, you will most likely be eaten alive. This game gave me lots to think about. It didn't totally win me over the first time playing it; and so I'm not eager for the next play of it, but I'm definitely intrigued.

Ok - the game is in some essence in the 2000's style. Can't really figure how, but it is.
And the game is as much of a decadence as the theme itself. I seem to like it - in terms of the gameplay just clicks within my mind in the right way the Knizia games do.
However - the game misses that little spark of brilliance that would make this veeeery good game a great and unforgettable one.

Love the originality of this game and how it feels like no other.  Art, Style, and theme are all quite original and pleasant.  Very Feld-like in that you can build up whatever strategy you pursue and also that divergent strategies are successful.  Choices and decisions are of the high quality and fun variety.  A classic to me now.

Nothing new in terms of mechanics (worker placement, some bidding and majorities), but well integrated. I like all those mechanics, so I like this game. Different ways of earning VPs, and pretty good interaction among players. Turns flow quite smoothly, no long times between each player action.
Original thematic, nice art.

Beautiful-looking solid Euro themed around the art Nouveau movement.  Worker placement with a 3-d feel as you try to score columns, blocks and the effect of the placement.  Very tactical feel in turn, but you need to keep a strategy in mind. Mechanisms intermesh well once you grok them.

I've come to recognize a recurring attitude I have with certain games. If I'm not interested in playing, I more or less tune out and just make moves without concern for my score or for winning. This was the case with Bruxelles 1893. 
First, it's a worker placement game, which in many respects, does not interest me. The theme also left me cold. The multiple decision spaces saved the game from being  a Lords of Waterdeep situation but there was something lacking in terms of appeal. It's certainly not a mediocre game, which gives me pause in rating it 5 stars, but I agree with "take it or leave it". I could probably give it an unenthusiastic second play but I'm nearly certain my opinion wouldn't change. 
Merci, mais non, merci.

Acheté sur son graphisme... Mais le jeu est absolument remarquable : les règles semblent à première lecture une surenchère baroque, en fait elles sont si naturelles et logiques que, même à la première partie, on ne remet quasiment pas le nez dans la règle.
La diversité des actions et des lieux de marquage de points ne fonctionne pas selon le facile "régime dissocié" à la Stefan Feld : ni au niveau du mécanisme, puisqu'il fait interagir les différents secteurs, ni au niveaux des joueurs, puisqu'ils restent en permanence en concurrence et interaction. Exemplaire.
Et en plus, passionnant à jouer. Et en plus, beau.

A really fantastic design. Just so much to keep players engaged here. A bit of warning though, this game can be MEAN and by mean I'm referring to the fact that players can feel legitimate angst playing this game. I don't think I have ever played a game where players had so many ways to mess with other players. If you don't play this aggressively, you can get squashed, but thankfully there are ways for players to be successful even if they make some early mistakes as there are MULTIPLE paths to victory. However, this is a bear to teach and is very fiddly on the table, so I think that it will be unlikely I add this to my collection.

There's definitely a trend towards making Euros more complex as time goes on, not something that I'm really keen on. This incorporates elements of worker placement, bidding and majority, so expect to take 45 minutes just to explain the rules. I'm struggling to see competing strategies here, everyone will want to do a bit of everything with someone eventually emerging as the winner. This is a much better first design than most things being pushed via Kickstarter, but Euros just aren't going in a direction that works for me.

I love the multifaceted bidding: placing a worker placed to take an action, a bid on a card, and also an attempt to get area control.  So there's a lot to think about.  There's also much more going on in the game: powers from cards, personalized scoring, the ability to make new buildings--and it all fits together really well.  Very interesting all the way through. Oh, and the art is great. (1 play)

RATING: 6
This game was a colossal disappointment to me after watching favorable reviews of it on Youtube, including Ryan Metzler proclaiming it to be the very best game published in 2013.  This is an ugly, boring piece of trash.  I understand the theme in Euro games is typically an afterthought, that it's all about the mechanics and gameplay.  However, theme is still important because it provides some kind of motivation about why I am pushing these cubes around and taking the different actions.  The theme was so unappealing to me as to mortally wound my enjoyment of the game.  We are all like some kind of aristocratic art collecting dudes in Belgium in 1893 during the height of the Art Noaveau period?  I like art and the works created during this period.  I hate this game. It is a bunch of different mechanisms that don't feel like they truly synergize together into a coherent game composition.  I love games in this genre.  This game simply isn't fun and there is no reason whatsoever to play this with sooooooooooooooo many excellent games in the same genre that are blow-your-hair-back fun.  Stay away!!!!

Fantastic euro game with lots of ways of victory and mechanisms getting together so well. 2 player game is surprisingly beautiful and with more players it become challenging.

I love this game so far. The rules seemed complicated at first, but they are well explained and incredibly intuitive once play begins. In fact, I found little need to refer to the manual even during our first play.

The Art Nouveau board is brilliant, as it involves a combination of worker placement, auctioning, and area control. The various kinds of actions are also impressively interwoven, making the game seem both rich and simple at the same time. Play moves quickly, at least at two players, and setup and take down were also pretty fast.

The artwork is beautiful, and some of the components are just plain cool. I especially love the clock and the device for selling art.

Over all, this is a fantastic game. I hope to see more from this designer.

Ugh...  Yet another soulless euro.
Exactly like 'Russian Railroads': no tough decisions, just follow the path you've chosen at the start...  Yaaawn... Mechanical, repetitive and boring - just the essence of the Feld-ian style.

So it would've been a '5', but one mechanic is plain broken: gaining majorities in columns.  The whole mini-game of avoiding the present given to the next player thrives, but 'presents' _must_ be made at some point...  This is sick.  These 'presents' can decide about the top performer(s) - if you've earned several cards this way, you can spend them to strengthen your chosen path(s) and have a great shot at winning.

RATING: 7
This might be a 6 for me, but I gave it some benefit of the doubt as I am euro’d out these days. It’s a big generic point grabber, a pretty good one, lots of options and things to watch for, fair bit of control, pretty low luck at least with lower player numbers, and of course a multitude of ways to score and a couple of paths to take but doesn’t do anything to stand out from the pack and is pretty derivative of several games as well. If you like Feld games you should like this too.

RATING: 7
This game feels strangely like a Feld point salad. There are so many paths to victory and ways to earn points that it is overwhelming for new players to properly grasp a proper way to generate those huge VPs. The game also features a mish mash of Euro mechanics that seems all over the place but is interconnected to one another. Each action in this game affects another action or player. Very underrated game.

This game does exactly the thing I love in games; when you choose your spot on the board, it has implications for action selection, an auction, and area control. I love dealing with multiple different incentives and weighing outcomes and this game does it well. The core of the game beyond that action selection system is pretty standard euro fare, except that building buildings modifies the board so that when other players go to certain spots you get a bonus. Correctly navigating that is also pretty cool. I do think that the clock for determining building costs doesn't feel particularly satisfying and there are some concerns in my group that the auctions could be more interesting. But overall, I really enjoy it and look forward to more plays.

RATING: 6
Bruxelles 1893 should be praised for some of the exciting new ideas it brings to the table. The art market, the clock-like dial for determining building costs, and starting with a full set of workers and having to get them back if they are overused are among the many new twists it has up its sleeve.

Then why not a higher rating? For one, the whole affair feels wildly unbalanced and at times too random. I enjoy a little variability in play experience, but turn order and player whims can really leave the game state unpredictable and unfair (it's a game where being lucky can certainly triumph good planning). But the worst part about the game is the "auction" for certain bonus cards every turn. I absolutely detest the idea of having to bid on cards without knowing if one will get a chance to bid again. That players lose all coins used in bidding is way too brutal. It's as if there's a American-style thematic game that is trying to cram itself inside a Euro.

I respect the designer for trying out some interesting new ideas, but the game has enough parts that I loathe that I don't see myself pushing for future plays.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (March 2016)

I was very keen to play Bruxelles 1893, it was one of my big omissions from the year 2013 so I bought the game at great expense. I regret I never bought it when it was widely available and a lot cheaper.	

The game components are nice and the art is also pretty good.

The rules aren’t that hard to explain. The difficulty arises from the quantity of rules, not their complexity. That is, there are many rules to explain, but they are easy to grasp. All the mechanism work very well together.

The theme is boring for me, but in any case I don’t feel it through the game, however I don’t mind much about this as most Euro games share this trait.
 
Bruxelles 1893 is a medium weight game. It features worker placement and area control (via bidding, you cannot attack other players directly, however, it still has a fair share of player interaction).

It offers lots of (interlocked) interesting decisions (should I create a painting?, sell a painting? get materials?, build part of my masterpiece?, get a character?, how much should I bid in my action?, how should I use the cards?, where to put my worker?). The decisions are not obvious in any way and each decision has far reaching consequences. 

Bruxelles 1893 has its fair share of luck, but I feel I can control it most of the time, so it doesn’t bother me. The only truly random factor are the paintings, you draw them from a face down pile and sometimes you can’t use what you draw. 

I love the random setup, so the game has a huge replayability factor.

I’m not sure if the game has different paths to victory. It seems to me, building your master work is a must, or you will lose. I have played only two times so I need more plays to verify this.

I have only played it with four and five players so I’m not sure how well the game handles fewer players, however, from the stock exchange phase, it seems it scales very well.

Bottom line, I was expecting something better, but perhaps my expectation was too high. In any case I really like what I see in Bruxelles 1893 and perhaps the game can get an upgraded rating from me. For now, my desire to play it remains high and I hope to try it again soon. A good euro game.

There's a good number of familiar mechanics in this game.  When put together the outcome was a bit disappointing for me.  It's a solid game that shares similarities with a few Feld titles and Homesteaders. It falls short though of those titles.

The highlight of Bruxelles 1893 is the graphic design. I have grown to really like the style of Roche which he introduced with Troyes. It's a mature style in a hobby dominated by mediocre and often juvenile tastes. Bruxelles is Roche's successful artistic take on Art Nouveau. 
The game behind it is not untypical for Pearl Games. Lots of elements, non-intuitive gameplay, rather mechanical. It works, it provides room for differing strategies, it's an interactive challenge for experienced gamers but it doesn't catch me in a way Troyes or Ginkgopolis have done. The return on investment just isn't good enough to compete in the crowded field of midweight to heavy Euros.

I like how there seems to be a lot of viable strategies. I suspect that this rating might go down with repeated plays. In many ways it didn't feel like a lot of my actions had a lot of important consequences as long as they were in line with my general strategy. At any point there were always a lot of actions I could take to push toward my strategy. Another worker placement game where there is very little blocking of essential moves.

Baroque kitchen sink game design that collapsed under its own weight. There's just too many mechanisms in there, often serving no apparent purpose (what design effect is that market reticule really supposed to achieve). The game that first comes to mind was Vinhos. If you liked that, Bruxelles 1893 might be for you.

Pre-release art looked gorgeous. Almost enough to buy the game based on. Unfortunately much of that art is hidden by tiles for most of the game, and the parts that are always visible are nowhere near as attractive.

Poster child for JASE or whatever you want to call it, but I really like the artwork and theme - it's nice to have something different, even if it is completely pasted on. This is clearly Feld-inspired, where the source of your points or success is somewhat clouded, at least for new players. Still, I wouldn't mind playing this more.

The number of things you have to take into account with each decision makes me (and I'm not alone) freeze right up. I am rarely taken over by AP, but this game gives it to me bad. I love the two WP boards, each with different rules; love the market mechanism, and the buildings, and the tracks. However, if I play this game, no one's having fun, being of how paralyzing I find it to be.

Egy kis területi többségszerzéssel és egyedi grafikával megbolondított stratégia.

 - Jó kis kombinálás, sokféle pontszerzési lehetőséggel
 - A tábla meghatározott részére a legtöbb munkást helyező játékos elveszít egy munkást (apró, de jó ötlet)
 - Elfoglalható akciómezők, amik egy kis bevételt biztosítanak, ha más játékos használja őket
 - Minden házépítést követően változik, hogy milyen nyersanyagba kerül majd a következő építés, ez jó kis taktikázásra ad lehetőséget

One of the best more complex worker placement games I've played. Unfortunately it takes some time to teach this and that is something which why I give this a rating 7, not 8. I'm part of a gaming group where we like to play different kind of games in every week AND until it's next time for Bruxelles we have more or less forgot the rules. The gameplay itself deserves a 8, because it offers many interesting game mechanics which works nicely together ALTHOUGH in the end this game (too) is just a worker placement game with point-salad-system - not the uniquest combo, I think. Bruxelles will stay in my collection anyhow, because this, Macao & Aquasphere goes to a bit longer 'play with only 3 players' -category.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
Pretty standard worker placement with lots of interesting ideas (like the painting prices, the manipulation of available actions, majorities etc.) thrown in. The problem is, none of these ideas felt representative of the theme - they were rather arbitrary. Still, interesting game, but it would have been better if these ideas supported something called theme.

Played once, 4p.  Really, a good game that is very easy to lose sight of the goal amidst the moving parts.  Even though I've only played once, it did seem like the bonus tracks (that is, the tracks that increase bonus points for the various scoring mechanisms) dominated the strategy.  Though the rules are a bit thick, and it seems like there's too much going on, the game is fairly straightforward (certainly no more complicated than, say, Brass).

Pervasive player interaction of the non-destructive kind that isn't common.  Theme is weird and confused (building buildings and trading art) but that's mostly harmless.  Play is rich and quite tense while being AP light and flowing quite well, even with 4 players.  Time will tell but the whole thing feels quite deep with fairly decent replayability and multiple viable overarching long term strategies.  Need to play more.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

There is quite the mish-mash of mechanics as many complaints say.  However, I don't believe it to be overwhelming as the game flow is fairly straightforward in nature.  I think this game likely rewards focus and specialization if you are able to do so.  When you build, I'd recommend trying to place in the middle of the board instead of the outside rows/columns in order to be more likely to benefit from secondary actions when someone chooses your building.  I do appreciate that this is a game that rewards specialization and doubling down hard on that specialization.  

This is no Troyes, but it is another solid game which I am looking forward to exploring more. 

Theme did you say?  What theme?  I sure didn't feel like I was an architect or anything of the sort!  :-)

This is a great game which accomplishes the difficult task of taking a set of mini-games, tying them all together, and making a sum that is greater than the parts.  Part worker placement, part area control, part point salad, part strategy, part tactics, and it all works together to make a fun experience.  Two criticisms:  1) once there is a runaway leader, there are no tools to stop him/her; 2) The complexity of the rules (not terribly complex, but many) and the layers of interconnectedness of the game make it harder to simply introduce it to a casual group for a casual event.  Bonus:  the art and graphics of the game are delightful, and some elements of the board are slightly different every time.  Theme is clearly pasted on, and this should be a JASE point salad, instead it's an engrossing game that I keep coming back to.

This game is like sudoku economic puzzle more than a game. Not theme at all and no effort to create fun, just 9 ways to score victory  points by pushing cubes through 5 economic engines. 

Folks will like this game if they are into math exercises, but it's not for me for sure. I won the one game I played by a massive margin because I figured out the math puzzle a turn or two before anyone else. One of the people that was playing checked out after turn 1, and the others made some mistakes early that cut them out with no possible way to catch up.

First play was surprisingly smooth, although reading the rules made me feel uncomfortable upfront. But once you are playing, the game flows naturally. 

Theme is so nicely illustrated. Game mechanics are not "wow", but they are interesting and challenging. As in many worker placement games, there are many ways to conquer points and there is enough competition on the board to make that exciting enough.

Although Bruxelles incorporates no real new mechanisms, it still feels different from other games.

Not a good first experience, and it's possible it's not a good 2 player game. As others have said, the complexity is overstated. It's not that complex, there's just lots of things going on. So you end up dabbling in a little bit of all these possibilities, none of which are compelling or fun, and then you calculate your score at the end.

It's mechanically sound. The art is great. It just fell flat for us.

What a huge disappointment. This offers nothing even remotely new and is quite bland. There's just not anything interesting here. To make matters worse, there are some serious balancing issues. I don't understand the high ratings. This game should have hit my sweet spot, but it's a total dud.

Update: Played 3-pl twice and 5-pl once. I rate it a 9, but I think you need quick players on 5 or I´d rather play with less.

Played once, 3-pl. Very favourable first impressions. I bought this based almost on theme alone, which of course is a crazy thing to do when it comes to eurogames. But I like it a lot. It´s a typical third generation worker placement game, where a lot of extra mechanisms are added. Lots of little rules to teach, but it played surprisingly fast and smoothly. Time will tell if there are any broken strategies etc. The one thing really missing is some historical background about the persons and buildings. Not many of these will be known outside of Belgium.

A very solid mid-heavy weight euro with many interacting mechanics (worker placement, area control, economy building, variable start player, collection and sale of goods) and different opportunities to score points.  Fortunately each of these mechanics is fun, and while I found scoring from the area control element to be particularly important when I played (as others didn't block me effectively), none of the mechanics seemed to overwhelm the others.

Difficult to stop run away leaders, and I expect that experienced players will be at a considerable advantage.  Nice theme and great components.

RATING: 7.3
Some interesting mechanics (especially like the market grid) but in first play, I really don't feel like one has another to do with another. The scoring feels like "making everything a thing". It's fine and I would try it again to see if I can find some cohesion.

RATING: 6
Initial rating based on a two-player game. Blends a lot of mechanics seamlessly and has many paths to victory. Feels like a Stefan Feld game in many ways. Should have a weight a bit lower than 3.6 as it is not that difficult to learn.
________________

Second play with four players was equally good but much different. Among other things, buildings seem to be much more powerful than in a two-player game. Despite coming in last, I was eager to play again right away.

----------------

Fourth play, the winner used works of art in hand with a strong multiplier to win. So it seems art, buildings, or maybe even patrons can be a strong path to victory if others do not make any effort to block you.

(Rules note - You may only tuck one bonus card in a single slot per round.)

Man, why is it that all Pearl games I've played so far don't feel intuitive. It's basically all mechanics, and a bit too much of them. Here's another worker placement point salad.

But interactivity is quite good in this game. Since it challenged me a lot more than the usual average Euro worker placement point salad I'd like to try again.

I knew the game would be unnecessarily long and complex for my tastes, but I was still excited because of the art-work and the theme.

I was disappointed that the game feels almost anti-Art Nouveau: Instead of feeling smooth and organic it feels overwrought and pieced together from unrelated parts.

Workerplacement mit einem variablen Spielplan und wechselnden Baukosten. Nicht ganz einfach zu planen, aber doch mit einigen Möglichkeiten zu korrigieren. Strategisch aber durch die nur begrenzt planbare Varianz beim Spielplan und den Baukosten trotzdem nicht ohne "Glücksfaktor". Hab noch kein Gefühl dafür, wie ausgewogen das Spiel sein mag... 

Das Design ist leider etwas unübersichtlich und nicht so mein Geschmack, aber das Spiel scheint auf den ersten Blick ganz gut zu funktionieren und macht Lust auf noch eine Runde. Gerne wieder!

Eindruck nach der zweiten Rund: Design bleibt unübersichtlich und birgt so unnötige Fehlerquellen. Muss ich nicht haben, spiele ich aber gern noch mal mit.

This one about reaches my limit for the number of different ways to score and consequences of placing meeples.  It's like the designer was playing the game and every time anyone did anything, exclaimed: hey, they should be a way to get something for doing that!  The graphic design actually made it a bit harder for me to read, and some of the icons on the cards very, very small.  Still, the game works fine and there are several different ways to approach play.  Would play again but do not need to own it.

A refreshing game with beautiful, albeit busy, artwork. At it's essence it's a worker placement game but there are elements of set collection, area control, auction and a market. 

The designers pull out two mechanisms I haven't seen before. First is how the art market changes. There's a square on a grid that can be shifted a number of spots depending on how many different types of art you have. Where the color of the art piece you're selling ends up on the square determines its value in coins and VPs.

Additionally, there's a neat mechanism for determining where actions could be played. Basically it's a small L shaped piece that when placed shows which area is open. I found that controlling this piece can be very powerful especially when there are bonus actions that each player can own by building on spaces. You either want to include more of your spaces or exclude those of your opponents.

Overall, very fun. I loved how all the pieces fit together for an engaging game.

Bruxelles is a Cruiserweight worker placement biding game.  My play group was a bit intimidated by it at the start, by the end we were seasoned pros.  Plays easier than it looks, however there is a lot of depth to this game.

TL;DR:  A game with a mishmash of gaming mechanics and paths to scoring and very little connection to theme.

----------------------------------------------------

Not sure about this game... little connection between theme and mechanics. Lots of disparate game mechanics with no rhyme or reason that I could distinguish. Game lacks focus.

A euro point salad game with various levers to pull reminiscent of a Feld design... confusing first turn and poor game graphics that detract from playability.

Wide point spread at game end, and difficult to catch the leader once a lead is built up as players have little means to attack the leader.

This is a game that appears to suffer from too much complexity but somehow it comes together quite beautifully. There are quite a few mechanics thrown into the mix, and most of them, even the more advanced, are familiar, such as buying locations so you can benefit when other players place their workers there. They are blended quite nicely here. My first thought after getting up from the table was to marvel at the different paths to victory, and not in a "point salad" way but from a truly different long-term strategy planning way. It was exciting and dynamic and I want to play it again. There is the chance that may diminish after more plays, but I am optimistic.

Bruxelles is an interesting worker placement game. On the complex side with some interesting mechanics. I am not really sold on the art, although it is in style with the theme. I played it once after it had collected dust for years on my shelf. After my first play I thought it was descent, but I didn't really feel like playing it again. To me there is just al little too much mechanics crammed into a fairly basic worker placement game. Sold it after one play.

Disjointed, unthematic, with random elements that screw with you every step of the way. Sadly I could not enjoy this game for a moment. A pity, as I liked the artwork for the cover of the game (the score board is also nice, but the rest could not even be saved by the artist)

Oddball mixture of worker-placement, resource-management, engine-building, area-control and bidding mechanics, with an unusual theme (which is irrelevant to gameplay but still, it leads to some beautiful artwork). The interplay between the two boards is fascinating, and can lead to unpredictable games where everyone crowds onto one board or the other depending on the situation.

Minor fly in the ointment: bad tile draws can really screw you over--if you're unfortunate enough to draw multiple paintings of the same colour, you're going to get virtually no money at the end of every round, through no fault of your own.

Apparently, the designer is a mad scientist who decided to mix together a bunch of Euro mechanisms and see what came out the other side. For example, on the 'Art Nouveau board', you're participating in typical worker placement... well, except that at the same time, the workers you place are also participating in an area majority competition and an auction simultaneously.

My two favorite mechanics in the game:

1) The "frame" which determines which worker placement spots on the Art Nouveau board are available in a given round.

2) The art market, where players use their influence to adjust the selling prices in the way they want.

Overall we both enjoyed the game. There's a lot to think about, and the complexity is just about the perfect level for my wife & me. Is it different enough from what we already own to keep it long-term? Not sure yet.

Tight old-school euro, with a good combination of mechanisms, and VP gathering engines. Since, I can't say it is a bad game, it is not one that I enjoyed, maybe because of all the confusion it creates with the many choices you have to make with each of your actions. It can be very frustrating, and won't excuse even the slightest mistake you make.

I usually like Euro games but this mix of non-intuitive scoring mechanisms didn't immediately catch my interest. Majority cubes at one place, cubes in a row at another place and so on. More games gave me a better understanding of the strategic options and screw you possibilities but also of the left player issue similar to Puerto Rico: if your left player leaves you opportunities to close an area and grab the majority, you will win (which I did), and vice versa.

Great euro worker placement game, one of my favorites. Very strategic game. When you place your worker the spot where you place him works for three different things. The actual action, an auction at the end of the round for the bonus card at the bottom of the column that you put him and for area majority around the emblems on the board. Very clever mechanism, elegant and it makes you think every move carefully.

I really like the idea of the game., and there are lots of decisions to be made. Like most worker placement game, timing is crucial, but the bidding system is really, really tricky, and is the part which I am unsure of - whether it's really skill-intensive or just some luckfest. I do believe better players can win most of the time.

Each worker placed on the main board executes an action, allows you to bid for auctions, and counts for area majority...simultaneously.  I'm not sure more thought is required for 1 action in any other game unless you think moves ahead in chess.  The artwork is also fantastic.

This game has a lot going on, but once you start playing everything makes sense. Selling paintings seems like a little mini game within the main game, but integrates nicely.

RATING: 7
Nice game, every move counts in many directions, but it is not my preferred kind of game: a bit too light, a bit more tactical than strategical and, more than anything else, the decision space is too limited. Choices are interesting, but usually they are limited to a set of possibilities. Winning is through opportunistic play, exploiting at the best the situation: a puzzle-like experience not offering room for a creative personalized play (more something like choices between some defined roads than roads that can be opened by players). So this is not what I search in the greatest games.

Thus said, I like the mechanics (with the possible exception of the bidding that favors too much the last one to play in a column), and the game is short and easy, so not the greatest game, but a good game, especially  when time is little. 

I suggest to try it, at least to give a look at the very original way a lot of mechanics are combined together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A bunch of random mechanics patchworked together, Stefan Feld would surely be proud of this game. But alas it is not his work.There is also the problem that the game is partially broken with people basically bidding on columns but doing this not knowing what the other players will bid, and they will not even get their money back afterwards. So in a column that has four places, the player placing a bid third will always be in a very bad position if he actually wants to win. Don't place your worker third you might say, but if everybody plays like that it only leads to stalling and eventually everybody being dissatisfied.

A friend of mine summed it up nicely: If you don't want to place your workers in a worker placement game, then there must be some serious design flaws.

Finally I don't like the icons and the graphics, just as I didn't like them in Troyes, but that may be just me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
There are a lot of interrelated and intersecting mechanisms in this game. Whilst you can seemingly ignore a part of the game (such as building) it does seemingly hamper you from getting other connected bonuses. E.g. if you don't build you don't add your tiles to the board and get bonus actions from other people using those spaces.

Enjoyable game overall

RATING: 8
Yet another to add to the category of medium-heavy worker placement euros with interconnected but seemingly orthogonal actions, that takes a fair bit of time to explain (because of all the rules). The difficulty seems to be a bit less than that of the 2012+ cohort (Asgard, Madeira), but nevertheless, one of those games that present a conundrum: it would be fun to play with a group that already knows it, and there is great dread in the prospect of teaching the game to someone who doesn't.

Not been hitting the table for a while, it's a good euro game, but cannot stand out with others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
It's one of those medium to heavy euros where every action has several effects and you must ponder all of them. But it's in the "different paths to victory" aspect where it really shines. There are many euros boosting the "several paths to victory", but I don't remember any of them where this is more true than here. I won my first game with less workers and competing with both rivals in my area (buildings), and usually the player with more workers has a huge advantage and when some players compete in an area, the reduce their chances to win.

The theme is there. The core is abstract, that's for sure, and the mechanisms are more important, but the theme is well implemented and the excelent Art Nouveau/Art Deco illustrations certainly help. You can believe you are trading with paintings, rasing marble buildings or mingiling with the high society of Bruxelles.

The rulebook is brief, but it details the rules very well. It takes some time to explain it, but once you do, you don't need to come back to the rulebook during the gameplay. According to BGG, 4 is the ideal number of players, but it worked very well with 3, and it seems to be very scalable.

It has no AP, but it's evident you will have to do some thinking; you will be able to do most of it during the out of turn time.

PS: I might have been somewhat stingy with my rating. I will raise it if the impression lasts a couple of games more.

Bruxelles 1893 richiede una lunghissima spiegazione perché le azioni a disposizione in ogni turno sono molte e tutte belle articolate. Malgrado ciò il gioco scorre fluido e piacevole con molta interazione e innumerevoli possibili risvolti. Un gioco di maggioranze e piazzamento lavoratori che necessita di molta attenzione, una buona programmazione e la ricerca di combo. In sintesi il gioco è molto strategico ma come ogni gioco con forte interazione è soggetto al kingmaking. Tra i titoli più solidi di Essen 2013 che trovo in Italia sia passato troppo in sordina.

Loved my first playthrough and am really looking forward to trying out all the various ways to score/win in my plays to come. This game does many-ways-to-win right!

Update:
After many a playthrough, I have found that this game does not allow the fluidity I usually seek in these types of games. A player kind of has to pick one or two things to be good at and go for it/them. Lateral movement late usually fails the player. Still like the game a lot, though.

Verdict:

What I Like: The idea of the three-actions-in-one (worker placement, auction, area control). The varied victory point paths are all balanced and interesting to pursue as well. The symbiosis players can force on one another is fun to use and navigate. Some really innovative mechanics are present here (the ever changing art market, for example, is a treat).

What I Don't Like: The three-actions-in-one in practice. Most of the time players place for just one of the three purposes, gaining the other two as random bonuses, and thus blocking based player interaction feels unintentional. The leader often seems to be the person everyone else accidentally blocked least. Never compete for the same objective as the person to your immediate right. Required focused engine building along one or two of the various paths means intentionally blocking the perceived leader toward mid-late game is often near fruitless victory point wise for the blocker, competitively dooms the blocked, and essentially kingmakes the uninvolved runner up.

[i]I got in a 2p game with Mat and we were both surprised at how well it played with two. Definitely a game I'm happy to play when I get the chance, but not something I'd add to my collection since it wouldn't get play at my house and a buddy of mine has a copy.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Theme; this is what really drew me into the game. 
- Learning the game was easy because all of your actions tied in quite well with the theme.
- Similar to Terra Mystica this is another heavy game that offers a variety of strategies to explore over multiple plays.
- Loved how the board where you can place workers only has a certain section available for each round.
- Bidding mechanic: On top of that when selecting a location for your worker you are bidding for majority in that column in order to receive the benefit of a card at the end of the column.
- Patrons: you can collect patrons that will give you different abilities which will typically help you with one of the scoring areas.
- Worker placement with set collection and area majority.[/i]

Wonderful worker placement game that is much more fun that it looks. Bruxelles 1893 seems complicated but it really just has more steps in its core actions. "Complicated", to me, is synonymous with "non-intuitive" and "random," they needlessly confuse and distract players. Bruxelles 1893 is not that game. The Art Noveau theme fits nicely with gameplay and the turns move quickly. The references to Stefan Feld VP-salad-type mechanics are not without merit; every action sets you up to immediately score something, whether it be selling art, using your influence on patrons or constructing buildings. Auction and area majority mechanic are also seamlessly blended into the game, adding layers of strategy to an already great experience. Overall, I loved much of the game: the modular boards, the one-upmanship of the auction, the edging out of opponents for easy VPs and how every action was always available to me every turn, despite the endgame's punishing score track. Being able to deduce what your opponent's next move was fairly easy because all information and resources were public and there were a couple of times when I was able to get to something before Paulo was, making my defeat that much more painful. It was only by a couple of points and if I had been more careful with my actions, I would have noticed that he was slowing edging me out. Overall, I loved this game and can't wait to show it to more people. It's an elevated Euro; I wouldn't introduce this game to new players, but the mechanics and the flow of the game settles in by round two. Love it!

RATING: 7
Lots of moving parts generates a point salad where it's advantageous to specialise in the collection of one thing to max points in it. But the nature of the provided worker placement approach within this is that everything is worth something to someone, so someone squeaking out a point can easily take the next option you desired which would have been worth a motza - not because of deliberate denial, but just because that what the best remaining option to them. This leads to more of an opportunistic approach which seems strangely out of sync with the deliberateness with which the provided strategies have been crafted. So that brings you back to point salad gaming, where your game (and how far you can get your specialisation) is led by the various timings of what other people leave you. The theme is non-existent, and being round-based makes it even less attractive. The game has lots of moving parts and a few seeming wibbles too far for what it provides. But having said that, the game is well-woven and gives interesting trade-off decisions with each meeple placed, and allows for different strategic paths to explore. So I enjoyed the game for what it is and the mental engagement it provides, but I can't help escape the feeling that accidental collateral damage will end up deciding most games, where the overwhelming coldness of its uber-Euro-ness won't lend itself to shouts of "let's play that again".

RATING: 10
very reactive.  very tactical.  many things to think about.  you have several options on your turn.  each of them may be related to different scoring categories, but they are all interconnected in what seems like a big web.  the decision making is tense.  the auctions and the area control also tense.  this game is so good.  this is NOT multiplayer solitaire.  this is very interactive.  EVERY move you make greatly affects your opponents and there is a tug of war the whole game.  but it doesn't feel too aggressive.  it's not personal.  your interaction is more like that of business rivals.  very very tense without being aggressive.

First of all: gorgeous artwork, another great work by Alexandre Roche. The game it self is a middle weight euro with a lot of decisions, strategic and tactical, area control, majorities, low luck, well you name it. With more players I think things will get quite thicker. The compass mechanism and the color cursor are brilliant details.
Another gem from Pearl Games.
Congratulations.

I am not too sure where this one will end up. It could nudge up to a 9 or fall to around an 8. More plays will be the litmus. 19/3/15

Update: OK, so this is now a 9.5. I think the first player gets too much of an advantage in this one. So I have deducted a half a point otherwise it would be a 10. 23/08/15

Update: back to a 9. A little off balance wise and a touch of being overwrought. Still a game I very much enjoy. 12/02/16

Bruxelles is a multi-layered worker placement game.  By placing a worker, you're not only gaining the action of that space, but you're also making a bid on the bonus tile for that column, as well as trying to achieve a majority around the adjacent intersections.  There are a number of different tracks that enhance your abilities, you can claim action spaces Caylus-style to gain benefits when other people use them, and lots of ways to get multipliers for various aspects of end-game scoring.  Plus, you have to manage both your cash and your building resources.  Every action you take has a lot of repercussions, and there are just a ton of different ways to play this game.

Much simpler than the rulebook suggests. I walked into this game expecting a typical euro. While it is a pretty standard euro, there is a lot of choices to be made and a lot of neat mechanics. Yes, this game does have quite a bit of setup randomness, but the game has very little luck. Tough choices and a brilliant game.

 Apparently this is the first game this designer has made. I don't now how much he has worked on this or if he had a lot of help from the design team of Pearl Games, but I all can say is: congratulations! 

This is totally my kind of game: worker placement, tight action spots (at least with 4 players, probably less tight with 2 or 3) and different ways to score points.

The only minus for me is the really ugly art from Alexandre Roche. He's never been my favourite graphic artist, but this is really the ugliest of all the work I've seen from him.

So far so good. This is the opposite to Copycat, in that for Copycat, I never felt immersed in the game. Whereas playing this game really does make me feel like an arisocratic entrepreneur. Initially it was a little overwhelming, but after a couple of plays, it became clear that although there is a lot of things to think about, there is only a few that can be considered at any one time. This realisation made the game move along a lot quicker for us. 

I kind of wish there were a few more rounds than the 5 that are specified. Maybe we'll experiment with that in the future.

In this game, action spaces are laid out in a grid. When a player puts a meeple in a space to take the corresponding action, they do so along with some number of dollars. At the end of the action round, whichever player's collective bids in each column are the largest get the special card at the bottom. The card can then be used for it's powerful central buff, or it can be tucked under a player mat to amplify one of the end game scoring category multipliers.

Add to that, at the end of each round, there's a little majority scoring amongst who occupies the most worker spots surrounding the shield icons, and then add the fact that players can put their own claim markers on buildings which means they get a cool benefit when someone else uses that spot, and you've got one of the most interesting, and player interactive worker placement games I've ever seen.

There's more to it than just that, there are actually multiple paths to victory, and cool cards to combo and basically everything I could ever want from a game like this, short of a more nicely illustrated board.

Very Euro, lots of 'mini-games,' and various paths to victory. Unfortunately, the 'builder-path' seems (to me) way overpowered, with that particular payout worth too many Victory Points.

My favorite game of the year. Reminds me a bit of a Stefan Feld title with lots of different ways to score points, however, I feel like all of these elements are very tightly connected in Bruxelles. This is exactly the kind of brain-burny nail biter I love. There's even a small amount of cooperation to be had on the auction board, which can really make things interesting as players hold on to resources waiting to see if an agreement goes south.

RATING: 10
In my opinion, this is lightyears ahead of most other games that focus on engine-building and area control. (Hansa Teutonica is as good and 'scratches the same itch', so they make a great pair).

The gameplay is 'thinky' yet relies a lot on intuition/instincts too. There are so many factors in each move that you step back and make your best judgement. I think this is more fun than games where you can arduously 'math it out'.

For example, when you place a worker on the board it does many things at once - it bids for a card at the end of a column, activates the space it is in, blocks the space for others and increases your domination of adjacent victory points.

It creates a very fluid, spatial 'work area' within which to place your meeples. It means you're directly in conflict with other players even when your goals are different. Most moves will consist of helping yourself and messing with someone else at the same time.

Within each round the available spaces will fill up and your options will rapidly reduce, so the game has a really nice feel of balancing what is urgent versus what you'd just like to get. Your later moves within each round are often less important but are still fun, as you can use them for things like:
- dumping your remaining meeples in places where it might frustrate an opponent.
- catching-up a bit in some weak spots, for example getting a few more coins from somewhere.
- intentionally exiting a round prematurely, without using all your meeples, in order to pick up a special bonus token you can use later.

Over multiple rounds (the game ends after five) players will become more locked into the situation they have made for themselves, so having a strategy is crucial.

There are even opportunities for semi-teamwork because of how buildings work in the game. (If someone lands on your building, you simply get a free action relevant to the space.) Perhaps it is essential for high scores. You could agree with another player to build on what they need if they build on what you need ... then land on each others' buildings and mutually increase each others' action-efficiency. If other players are avoiding each others' buildings, the teamworking players could pull ahead. Still only one winner, though!

This game very possibly beats great designers like Strefan Feld and Vital Lacerda at their own game. For example, I really like Vital's Vinhos Deluxe but that game is drenched in blunt, dry mathiness compared to Bruxelles and it doesn't have Bruxelles' nice way that your strategy crystallises over time.

Superb.

A explicação assusta, principalmente se você não é fã de jogos muito pesados. Mas o jogo flui muito bem depois, rápido, natural e com decisões interessantes, como um bom euro deve ser. Algumas ideias ali são geniais, como a mistura de worker placement com leilão e controle de área, assim como o controle do mercado e a moldura que elimita que área do tabuleiro pode ser jogada, e faz com que o jogo escale bem para qualquer quantidade de jogadores (em teoria, só joguei com 5).

(+) Nice artwork: The game 'breathes' Brussels and Art Nouveau
(+) Elegant rules: it doesn't take long to explain the game
(+) Interesting game time: even with new players a 5-player game can be played in about 2 hours
(+) Intertwined gaming mechanisms: Each choice you make influences others and effects future actions in a turn
(+) Very original and well-implemented combination of: worker placement, area control and bidding
(+) Feeling of progress: there are numerous ways to invest in different area's to aid your strategy
(+) Multiple ways to develop a winning strategy

(-) Although the rules are rather simple and elegant, this game is all but easy - in fact, the intertwined gaming mechanics in which each choice you have to make effects other actions, makes this one of the heaviest games I have played so far. It's a real brain-burning challenge. I like this aspect a lot, but I can imagine there will be times when I or others would prefer a lesser brain-challenge.

This game tries to do too much at once with a rather disapointing outcome. Worker placement, area control, bidding... The artwork is ugly, the theme is well, is there a theme? it is fidly, and the player who won just did it by scoring 16 to 24 point per round just because he focussed on one engine and did nothing else than repeat the same thing turn after turn... Glad it was over...

RATING: 7
This is a very good game. It's indeed a little intimidating at first sight, but after a few moves everything become pretty intuitive and straightforward. I won't really define it a point-salad, but more as a race, because it's really not a good idea to let the opponents do what they want without trying to interfere. A player who tries to get all the characters will easily beat another one who is focusing only on the building, and a player who is trying to bid last on every column to easily win the auction will leave too much space to others who are bidding cheap because they mainly want to win crossroads. Even winning every auction is not universally useful, but only if you really need a specific prize. The main point is therefore equilibrium, both to not miss an easy opportunity to get points, and to not make other players have a too much a easy game for the lack of counterplay. 
My only doubts are the first player rule, (it's way too easy for the first player to be always the same), and the fact that it's way too much of an hardcore game to be properly played with beginners. Whoever get a beginner to his right is going to get an huge advantage, but i guess that this is the kind of problem that is solved only with experience.

Very nice how it all clicks together in a middle weight worker placement points salad type game. They must have had fun play testing this one, but it seems to have paid off and is nicely balanced. With a game under the belt you have a much better idea of which paths to go down, what goes well together, which personalities to keep hold of and when, where the big points can be made. I'm looking forward to exploring this one a lot more and trying different approaches. Flows very easily and 25 minutes per player on the box seems about right, maybe a bit less with experience.

Not sure how much I like the most money in a column wins the bonus card mechanic. Especially when columns are short this seems to reward players with cards who can get their timing right. But is it timing or more often just good fortune? There is an art to it - buying buildings helps - but too often it just seems to be a gift.

A good game with many moving parts.

Lots of wonderful new ways to combine different traits of Euro games in this one. The worker placement has a bidding angle to it, which seems unique. And there is some examples of set collection and area majority for scoring. I also like how the starting player gets to choose what parts of the board are available for play during the round. And the art market, where you earn a combination of money and points, is really interesting to manipulate.

Finally got this to the table and it's a really good game.  It mixes together a few different elements as you're trying to juggle lots of different factors while maximizing your placements and fighting for area control.  You're also trying to get people to use your buildings so you get little perks.  Lots of great mechanics and it flows really nicely once you get into it.  Will definitely play it again and it has the potential to increase in rating.

The game is a classic worker placement game that offers many choices. Unfortunately you can't do much than following a certain path from the beginning. Too much struggle for the bidding in the art nouveau board. Little interest in the Brussels board. Assistants in detention is a certain pain. Tucking cards is not easy.  Construction action is important. Left me a good taste but it is not my type of games I like. I would play it again only to show to new players something different of complicated games.

A very fine game that I finally got the pleasure to play recently.
It's been on my radar since its release, but only now have had the opportunity to play it. It's somewhat typical euro-fare done [i]really[/i] well. I have been shying away from euros recently in favor of titles that focus more on interaction and economics, but this felt like a refreshing jaunt back to my euro gaming roots. The game is just on the heavy side of medium in complexity and is reminiscent of other classic Pearl and WYG titles where there are a variety of interconnected moving parts that hum along like a well oiled machine. 

Highlights: 
-The bidding system that's intermingled with subtle area control and action selection elements. 
-Just enough randomness to create uncertainty without sacrificing too much player agency. 
-Alexandre Roche's art gives the game a lot of charm.
-Has more interesting interactions than a lot of other euros. Though it's still firmly in the "indirectly interactive" territory, it occasionally breaches that categorization, especially as it reaches endgame.

Hard to make a good call on this one, as we played it late and didn't get in a full game. I like the look of it, and I enjoyed the market mechanic as well as the auction board, although I'm not sure that I'd call this a top-tier game. I think it just doesn't quite have enough novel mechanics and I didn't feel enough like I was building toward something.

UPDATE: Finally got in a full play, and really did manage to enjoy the opportunistic ways to score points. Would still agree that it's not quite top-tier, but I like how the area-control and auction mechanic of the action board affects point scoring and special cards, plus you have a couple of different ways to build a strategy to score points.

This is a worker placement game set during the Art Nouveau movement in Brussels in, you guessed it, 1893.  Well, 1893-1910 anyway.  There are quite a few moving parts in this game and a very variable setup but instead of feeling fiddly it actually all works incredibly well together.

It's a bit much to explain just in comments but the main crux of the game is that there are two boards of actions.  One, in typical worker placement faction, has actions that can only be used by one player.  The other can by multiple players but the player at the end of a round with the most workers in this second area will lose a worker, which without a way to easily get him back can be pretty devastating.  Making these choices further interesting is the start player each round chooses which actions are available in the first worker placement area by placing borders on a grid of all the possible actions.

There is so much that is randomly seeded in this game from the worker placement boards to the cards that dictate the stock market and where the borders are placed each turn to the patron cards to the reward cards to the spaces on the building materials wheel.  I absolutely adore this because each game will feel incredibly different.

There is a wealth of options available but they tend to run out early so the game strikes this incredible balance of giving you a wide array of options and then taking them away quickly so each and every decision is incredibly impactful and important.

I will say I'm a bit afraid a heavy patron strategy is a bit strong in this game.  The couple of games I've played where a player focused on accumulating patrons and patron score bonuses, they have won by a healthy margin.  This just may be a result of those game circumstances but when a pattern like that starts to emerge I get wary.

The one major complaint I do have with this game though was the component quality, especially the cardboard.  There is a lot of cardboard in this box and the glue used to glue the paper art to the cardboard was awful and almost all of my pieces are peeling and seperating.  I needed to buy rubber cement to glue the majority of my pieces back together.  That's pretty unacceptable.

RATING: N/A
Played once only and with 5 players. The best format to play the game seems to be 4/5 players which is good news because not often good 5 player games appear.

Bruxelles seemed complicated to understand. All its small nuances, especially the decision on where to play your helper summing up the bidding system. But the game flow happened to be straight forward and the time of play can easily be reduced to 90 minutes, I guess.

The small parts combined give players the feeling that everything is connected and the way VP's are gathered come in a reasonable number of different sources.

The amount of men each player has to play with it's important and here is where I feel the game could give more equal chances to each player. Getting your men back from the courthouse it's not an easy task and often happened in our experience that only one bonus or personality card was available in the turn making this action the most valuable one for an important part of the game. That's mostly a drawing issue as in our next game I guess the way cards are randomly taken can make this action much less valuable if the  number of cards appear in a more balanced way but, nevertheless it felt a bit annoying.

Certainly a good game to watch for and play a lot more times in order to get into it and appreciate it in a much more honest way.

Tight, clever worker-placement. Workers are placed in a grid, with placement informed by at least four (!) direct factors:

1. The action of the space
2. If another player has built over the space, the secondary benefit they receive
3. Each square of 2x2 workers will score points for the player(s) with the majority of workers there
4 Workers are placed with coins; majority of coins in a column gets a bonus card

...and, of course, the usual timing games; in particular, players can be blocked from selling paintings or from building, because required resources change over time. End-game scoring is based on acquired multipliers for various categories (paintings, buildings etc.).

The multiple incentives around are pleasantly difficult and the majorities remind me a little of Rokoko (but I think Bruxelles is strictly better).

Unfortunately, the painting subsystem does not work particularly well. Drawing paintings early in the game is unnecessarily swingy as a lucky player will have both a higher income and better opportunities to sell. This can be mitigated with exhibition tiles, but that's a weak answer and an unnecessarily wrinkle in an already-complex game.

I admit, my primary incentive to buy this game had been the graphics.
I like the Art Noveau style and to my knowledge this is the only game that has used it so far.
The actual gameplay is not bad either. A worker placement variant which feels a little bit "Feldian", which by itself should not be a bad label.

From the same stable as Troyes, and displaying the same traits: slightly intimidating rules, somewhat complicated mechanisms. A fair amount to describe to new players, but once you've done it a few times it becomes a lot easier.

I particularly like the Art Nouveau board use, placing workers to do 3 things at once: perform an action, make a bid on a bonus card, and for positional majorities scoring. Even the trick for adjusting board size for number of players is good.

Plenty to explore here.

While I appreciate the art style for this game, I don't like it. It's just not pleasing. And oh my! some of those icons are tiny. Like I-think-it's-time-to-buy-me-new-lenses tiny. And some of the icons are not self explanatory. But once you get going it they are good enough to remember you about what does what.
I felt like there where a lot of rules for this game, but after turn one, it's clear that it's actually all pretty straight forward.
There are plenty of interesting choices, and there probably are a couple of different strategies to explore.
I did feel the market value mechanism - while original - felt a bit like it was shoved in, just because the author came up with some new mechanism. It didn't blend with the rest, which was all quite nicely brought together.
Another solid offering from Pearl Games

Tried too hard to have multiple systems that existed, but didn't really mesh together well.

Worker placement, but feels a little bit different. Every move has few consequences. For example when i`m playing my asistant on the Art Nouveau board i make an action, maybe give someone else a bonus action, a maybe fight for majority around a shield and for a bonus card. Everything in one move. I like this. I don`t like that the building strategy looks after the first game stronger than other sttategies.

Maybe you must do this and everything else is a bonus, something that depends who wins (something like the aristocrats in Sankt Petertsburg - you must have many of tchem, when every player has the same amount aristocrats everything else will determine the winner. Maybe the first play was not representative ?

Edit: Buildings are important, but the multipliers in the end of game scoring are also very important (+). In the game are some small rules, that you can easy forget (-).

RATING: N/A
*Unplayed. Bruxelles looks suuuper fiddly. This seems like a design that conflates strategic obscurity with strategic depth.

I think it is usually a mistake to stack interlocking mechanics up to the ceiling to produce complexity. Complexity should emerge from the board state and the player decisions. Choices aren't more interesting just because the consequences are opaque.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Despite winning my first game against three good players, I tend to think Bruxelles has gratuitous goings-on (as it were). All the mechanisms are nice individually--the resource clock, the art sale "cursor", the art sales limits, the action strips; and the used-before persons, card-driven special actions, shield area control and special card "column control". However, combined, they're a bit much. I have the feeling the designer is shotgunning to try to get to the [person=6045][/person] Rondel effect.*

Still, I didn't find the game odious, except in length of time to explain the rules, and it may grow on me. Or not.

*Id est: [person=6045][/person] has a rondel, and gets to publish a bunch of rondel games. Dr. Knizia does auctions and he becomes the auction guy.

Bruxelles has quickly become a favorite game in our house. It's a darn good worker placement game with multiple avenues for scoring (quite Feld-ian in its approach).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
More is not always better. Bruxelles 1893 is probably the game this phrase is most suitable for. It's got so many shifting elements (action selection frame, works of art etc.) and mechanisms that all work but are incredibly hard to keep track of and bear with at all times. It's most distinct and most differentiating  aspect is its worker distribution at the beginning and the evlution of workers at hand. In your regular worker placement game everyone starts with the same low number of workers and works towards getting the maximum number of them the fastest because having more workers than others is very profitable. Here, everyone starts with the same amount of many workers and you have to consider at what point in the game you are willing to sacrifice them. You are able to get them back, but that's a tough because mostly expensive undertaking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A really neat game and I like almost everything about it. Every move feels tense because more and more spaces become blocked off as people place their workers. The board being a different size every round is something I don't think I've seen in another game and it works well here.

I just don't rate this higher for a couple of reasons. First, the luck factor. There's few random elements in the game, but one of them, drawing works of art, can really influence the game. You can become almost completely locked out of that part of the game and you waste actions if you don't draw the right thing. I would like to try a variant where you keep your works of art face-down, so it becomes much harder to completely block somebody out of selling their works of art.
The next reason is that while it seems like there are multiple paths to victory, constructing buildings seems to be the biggest way to get points. Maybe that's intentional or maybe more viable paths would reveal themselves with more plays, but in our game the winner came down to who got a good bonus to their building points in the final round.
The last thing is that some of the iconography could have been clearer. All through the game I had to keep asking "what does this do again?" I'm sure by the second or third play it would all be more clear, but trying to teach the game to multiple people at once would surely be a nightmare.

Still, not a bad game and I would play it again. My rating could go up or down based on how those issues play out in further games.

First Impression:
This is a themeless euro that has a clear concept: One action - several consequences.

I understand that there is an audience for this game, but it's not me. I prefer games that have clear actions with a few but deep mechanics. In this game you place a worker and you do 4 things at the same time: a) You pick an action, b) You participate in an area control minigame, c) You participate in an auction for a bonus, d) You bid for first player. Not all of this things are implemented in a fine way btw - the auction in particular forces a bad waiting strategy; but overall it's working. However, you can't really control all the implications of your actions and so the game ends up feeling very restricting and a bit chaotic.

Thematically, Bruxelles is a bit of a muddle. It's centered around the art nouveau movement. You are architects... but you also make paintings and attend the theatre (but only to hit up famous patrons). Those things didn't really feel cohesive to me. But honestly, theme, while nice, isn't crucial to me.

What I really loved about this game are the mechanics. It does a couple of really novel things with worker placement, which really set the game apart. There is a 5x5 grid of actions spots that are randomized every play. Those 25 spots are made up of 5 different types of actions. Additionally, every turn the start player has a choice between two subsets of the action spots to put into play for the round. So depending on the choice, some actions will be more accessible while others won't be. When you place a worker you include some money and at the end of the turn you see who bid the most money in a column, and that player gets to take the card beneath that row, which either gives you some advantage or some scoring bonus.

Additionally, there is a shield at the corner of every action spot. At the end of the round, you look at the shields and if all four spots bordering it were filled, it scores. Whoever has the most workers around that shield scores points (ties mean all tied players score)... and how much you score depends on whether you've upgraded your scoring track for shields.

There are also a couple of other spots that aren't on the main board that you can use in a turn. These don't cost money, but these spots may require you to place more than one worker depending on whether they've already been used, and whoever used them the most loses one of their workers. These spots let you do a couple of things, most notably you can do an action that is no longer available on the main board. There are also spots that get you money and resources, and one that lets you trigger your patrons, which is often a powerful move.

Finally, you can build your buildings on the main action spots, which means that when people use that spot you get a bonus depending on what type of building it is.

So placing a worker on the main board becomes an interesting dynamic of a) what you want to do and will it be available later if you don't do it now b) bidding for cards on a column c) trying to get majorities around shields d) will it trigger a bonus for someone else, or will it trigger a bonus for you if you leave it for someone else... And then you have to think about the other action spots that only require meeples and determine if you need to take them early (less workers) or if you can wait (which may mean playing a lot of workers and losing one).

Despite all there is to think about, it's not really that much of a brain burner. And I've skipped over a lot of the rest of the gameplay to focus on the worker placement... but it is the shining jewel in the game. Overall I liked this a lot.

This is an extremely impressive game, and for a first-time designer, it's nothing short of amazing. Features a unique take on worker placement, combining bidding, area control and the usual turn-order angst. 

Things I like:
- Managing money vs actions as related but decoupled resources reminds me of Caylus, which is never a bad thing.
- It combines a lot of familiar point-salad tropes (I've heard comparisons to Feld) but that it doesn't easily allow you to hammer one or two actions and ignore other parts of the game; regardless of your strategy, you will likely end up needing to do a bit of everything during the game, and the players who make the most opportunistic moves will tend to come out ahead.
- The bold and confident art design

Things I dislike:
- The scoring track wraps around at 80 instead of 100. It just bugs me.

Having played this quite a few times on boiteajeux.net, I've come to realize that everything is secondary to increasing your architect level and cranking out buildings. It looks like there are lot of paths to victory but there really aren't. That and it's difficult to get architect level increases. If you get the one guy who can give you one level increase per round you're doing quite well. Rating - 7

Under review.

A game with beautiful art and extremely well functioning mechanisms, but the dynamic created therein seems to lack charisma. I'm not referencing theme at all, I don't need to [i]feel[/i] like an artisan, but there's something about the actions of this game that strike me as unexciting, or perhaps less than they should be.

I suspect it's due to my changing tastes as far as pacing goes, so for many I think this won't be a problem. For me, though, the traditional microaggressions of Euro games just aren't enough any more - I like swift, sharp knife-fights in elevators. Or phone-booths, take your pick.

A pretty complex game, but once you get familiar with all the posibilities, this turns out to be a very solid game with many options to be victorious. Interesting gameplay and dipped in incredible beautiful artwork. It certainly helps you to get into the spirit of the Art Nouveau era. After a couple of plays I do get the feeling that a particular strategy often is the key to succes or at least getting close to victory. But I let you find out yourselve which strategy that is. Nevertheless, I really love this game.

This one took my by surprise - it's a phenomenal euro! I love the worker placement/bidding/area majority system (yes, it's three in one). It makes you think in a very unusual way about using your workers to perform otherwise standard actions. The gameplay is full of player interaction, you have to watch every move of your opponents and adjust your plans accordingly. I'm really glad I've purchased this game, it's a hidden gem. The rating will definitely go up after more plays.

I really really like this one!  It blends a lot of interesting mechanics into one game that interact really smoothly.  To be honest, I tried to pick out which mechanics were my favorite and they ALL were!  The recruiting of helpers and how they activate, the changing market for pieces of art that you influence, building buildings to cover spaces on the board and get extra benefits when others go there, the area control, and auctions for the cards are are really slick and well done!  There really isn't anything I don't like about the game other than it does seem like a building strategy can be a little over powered, but most experienced players dismiss this idea so I will trust them on that.  We didn't find the game to be on the heavier side and felt like it was more a a medium weight euro.  Rulebook was well done and the art was great as always from Roche.

Same art style as Troyes and Tournay, worker placement, several ways to score points, interesting grid where actions taken can also influence end of round bonuses and scoring, cool resource building cost dials, shifting artwork market token/grid thing... hits many of my favorite buttons, so it's great!... but, it loses a point for what seems to be one strong strategy for end game VP's (construction + architect track)

Excellent game. Very nice combination of smart game mechanics. Not too long, equally funny for 2 to 5 persons. Also promotes the artistic skills of our little country !

This has a lot of little [metaphorical] cogs that work together and independently — and I like it.  Your first play will likely serve merely as education of what you want to differently next game — and I like that, as well.  In fact, I suspect that this is a game with enough depth that I will keep diving into it in different fashions in order to try to do better.

…and of course, it has helped me to become obsessed with Art Nouveau!

I'm not the biggest worker placement fan, but this one I liked after one play. It's got enough seemingly viable paths to victory that my curiousity is piqued, and I like the interactions between the various game mechanics. I like the art style too. Moves quickly enough as well, after a learning game.

Update: Still liking it after 5 plays, although it gets a bit long with 5 players if players take too much time. The initial reaction is "a bunch of mechanics thrown together", but after playing it really is evocative of the theme and everything gels quite well. There's always interesting tradeoffs when making decisions. The game rewards not just having a good plan but more importantly adapting to what others are doing.

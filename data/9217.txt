Took me ages to grasp the strategy of this game - and not sure I have yet.
For new players:  Don't buy buildings unless you have a crazy amount of gold.
Buy workers at the start and aristocrats at the end.
This strategy will lose you the game, but not as badly as I kept losing....

Tight economics and multiple ways to win make for a fun and tense game.  Only complaint is that you can get screwed based on the turn order thanks to certain card combinations coming out.  Nobles seem much more valuable than buildings.

It's really a card game masquerading as a board game, it won 2 major awards when it didn't really deserve any, and yet it's starting to grow on me and I find myself playing it fairly regularly.

Traded for War of the Ring and Neurashima Hex. 

UPDATE--lots of good memories with this game from when I first got into the hobby, but I don't play it very often and wouldn't mind getting a game I do play more in a trade.

One of the first Euro Games I played.  A great introduction to gaming--less random than Settlers.  Played with Kara so many times on BSW--warms the heart.  The Observatory is MANDATORY.  Also, the pieces are beautiful.  [update] I think I need to play this with more skilled players--it's hard to teach because nobody will buy aristocrats, even if you tell them it's important, and then they lose by a lot.

150909 Now that I've got a feel for this game, its in our rotation.  Its very much a traditional game in its feel even with all the extra fiddliness that comes with a designer game.

130929 I've gone from absolutely hating it to seeing something there to really not feeling much interest in playing it.  I could be convinced again, but I doubt it will be a favorite...or even well liked by me.

100501 Something just doesn't click for me.  I think I feel like I'm getting dragged along by the game mechanic more than having much control over my destiny.  But its our gamenight host's favorite game so I'm guessing I'll have a few more plays before truly giving up on it.

Played with David, TG, and Zack last TNG night. Well balanced game with emphasis on good money management and incrementaly building ones' empire. TG won with buildings, Zack passed me in final scoring for second with the most aristocrats. Great game want to play it again, thin on concept but who cares.

Decent and fairly light euro card game about rebuilding Saint Petersburg via workers, buildings, nobles and certain improvements. Plays in under an hour and has so far made a close finish at each play - many different strategies to explore. Again, the girl beat me on her first play (by one point....). My folks will play this game so definitely a keeper!

I have a hard time not liking anything about this game.  It's fairly simple, the way the system works and how it produces points and money... very well done.  The division of phases makes sense and I understand why phases work in certain games.  

12/27/05 - One of our least played games.  It's just too much like solitaire and no real interaction I find.  Not big on this anymore.

11/25/06 - Times are a changing, I'm liking this again.  Upgrading to a 7.

12/4/07 - Really just a solitaire game.  I'm surprised I fluctuated so much.  Do not look this game, nor would I recommend it.  Really just annoys me.

The game involves buying and placing cards in front of you to repeatedly activate them gaining gold and victory points. The market changes frequently and cards become cheaper. It feels like a simpler streamlined version of Copycat. San Juan is another close relation. There is something charming about the odd child-like artwork, and the strategy is light enough to introduce to non-gamers.

I love this game and am excited about the upcoming reprint. This is the only reason I traded away my copy, in exchange for Chinatown.

Not a bad game but a bit dry and has too little player interaction to my taste.

After many years I have come to appreciate Saint Petersburg. Sure, it can be seen as a dryish game since there is very little of anything that is not polished and balanced. In other words, compared with many of the newer games that are overflown with twisty mechanics, bits and pieces, fluff and art, Saint Petersburg feels either ascetic or elegant. It is your choice which point of view you assume. Personally, I dislike the art and that cannot be helped but it does not break the game since it also serves its purpose.

Anyways, the game is nicely balanced and offers many tough decisions retaining tension until the very end. Set collection is simply fun and you have to keep an eye on other players as well. Interaction between players takes place at subtler levels of perception and there are virtually no "in your face" events. 

Despite being elegant, the game does not induce any greater needs to spend all your time with it. The game is mostly tactical with emphasis on short term decisions. When to buy and when to save money is the question. Moreover, Saint Petersburg can be very ruthless since there are no catch up mechanisms. I am fine with this but new players should be warned about it.

Once upon a time there was a trout, living in a small river. It was a beautiful river, but rather shallow, and the trout was hungry to see the deep water. So it left the river for the big wide sea and swam with the big fishes. The big ones were very nice and friendly fellows, and they all played a while. But it turned out that big fishes like to swim fast, and the trout couldn't keep up, and things got awkward. So the trout stopped playing Saint Petersburg and returned to the river. The End.

(Really, Saint Petersburg is a wonderful game with great mechanics. But I made the mistake of repeatedly playing it with people who were significantly smarter than me. Turns out this takes away all the fun. Especially in a game that is about as random (and complex) as chess. Really great game. Just ... stay in your own waters, yes?)

Took me a while to learn to play it right.  Finally did.  It's a tricky card game where your actions are based on several strategic factors.  Get money to get points and aristocrats for the endgame.  Have still only played 2 players.  The strategies aren't apparent for the first few plays.  It takes a couple plays to really get what's going on.  (Did for us, anyway.)

+ Very straightforward to teach; Surprisingly interesting decisions to make based on the different cards that come up during play.
- The theme and components are a bit bland.


Why it's previously-owned:
The game is too fiddly with the cards and money constantly flowing in and out of personal reserves. The computer version takes care of all the annoying little parts and makes it so I'd never want to play it in person again. 
I traded this for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

Economic-type card game with simple rules.  This would have been an average game (just build the best/most useful of what you can afford), but because of the ingenuity of the 3-card hand coupled with the rules for drawing new cards, we have an interesting game.  (Imagine: this game would be pretty boring if there is no 3-card hand and a fixed number of new cards are drawn each phase.) However, some balance issues tend to make the optimal strategy monotonous, reducing re-play interest after many games.  A "8" or better with my variant.

A good card-based game.  I like the mechanics, execution and style.  The complaint I've heard levied against it is that there's always an optimal play and, once you know what the optimal plays are, there's no real decision making.  In other words, it loses replay after awhile.  Even so, it's a nice game and I enjoyed it.

I played a few times with two and I did not like so much. I found it too repetitive and long. I even tried a variant in which we eliminated 10 cards from every deck (therefore, it was not so easy to score the maximum number of nobles), I think it improved, but I would play San Juan any day instead (both card games feel like they are offspring of Puerto Rico, and I clearly prefer The primogenitor). I have only played four players a few times, but I think that the game is much more interesting with that number.

Dette spillet har jeg nok spilt mest av alle spill, særlig fordi en kompis ble helt hekta, selv om han tapte...  :-) Her gjelder det å finne en balanse i å skaffe seg penger og ikke minst å gjøre kort tilgjengelig for deg selv og ikke andre. Man kan eventuelt gå for poeng tidlig, men da må man sørge for å tømme en av bunkene med kort (vanskelig taktikk) Dette spillet virker lett å lære bort, men her er det et eller annet som stopper opp for noen nybegynnere.

The rules are somewhat confusing. In my first game, we wrongly scored all cards during the scoring part (so we both had tons of money) and ended the game early when we realized that we should only be scoring the worker/building/aristocrat/upgrade cards during the associated phase. In my second game with four players, we all had a blast! UPDATE: A keeper, great card game with a board. 2015 UPDATE: I haven't played it for a while and I see myself playing newer games first. As an engine building, card drafting style of game, this one is not memorable and comes across as boring in video reviews.

A nice game, if it's not played too often nor too seriously, as it tends to get repetitive (there aren't many ways to win, basically you buy workers for the first two rounds and then aristocrats, the occasional really good building and still more workers for the rest of the game). Raised from 6 to 7 cause it's much less repetitive than it first looks (I know this might sound strange).

Gran juego de cartas para 2 á 4 jugadores. Básicamente consiste en ir comprando cartas que dan más dinero o puntos de victoria. Es cortido, unos 15-20 minutos por partida y muy muy divertido, de mis favoritos sin duda. Como nota negativa el uso de billetes de papel para representar el dinero, en vez de las prácticas monedas de cartón. La verdad es que prefiero la versión online de bsw para jugarlo, pues es un juego en el que hay que contar y calcular continuamente y con el programa nos salen las cuentas ya hechas del dinero o puntos que obtendremos en cada ronda, lo que acelera mucho el juego.

RATING: 8
2-4(4)

Sometimes the gameplay seems a bit scripted and some of the decisions feel too apparent, but it's a tight game where the whole game dynamic is between setting up a big end game payoff and getting somewhat more marginal points each turn.

I like it ... it's a solid game system. The card rebates can make anything viable in any game. Buildings often get neglected early in the game, but if many markets come out, you can possibly get a batch of them for 15 rubles and now you're scoring points and primed for upgrades.

Issues I have: there's a brutal runaway leader issue ... not as far as points (though I can see it happening) but moreso with respect with cash. Getting an extra worker early on can really cascade into a big lead. Aristocrats can make up the shortfall, but are expensive and harder to get cost rebates and it feels like going with an early building strategy will peter out (heh) quickly. I don't really like the Observatory (I play with it, still), but it can make up the shortfall (or aggravate it).

It's dry and can feel pretty mechanical. It often feels like there are "right" things to do and while money is tight and the decisions are important, there doesn't always feel like you're agonizing over the decisions. Well, it'll take all my money, but I clearly have to get this aristocrat. Etc.

Lots of luck in the card draw, especially in the trading deck as far as which worker upgrade cards flip. You can diversify, but that's costly.

Aristocrat scoring can be pretty swingy. Obviously, you spend the whole game building your aristocrats, but it's a pretty huge chunk. It is what it is, I guess, but it makes buildings less interesting overall, I feel.

Still, I like it fine enough.

From Game Kastle Flea Market for $20 on 11/07/09. Punched.  Missing 11 10 rubbles money.  Requested replacement from RGG.  

Just tried with JaggedTech(greg) and Tornadochaser(phil), very intereting euro with card drafting & hand management.  Greg won with 20+ pt margin despite Phil's attempt to catch him.  I think I spent too much on expensive buildings and aristocrats too early, should have build up a bit more workers.

A clever game using basic principles of economy and efficiency which require you to make decisions about spending (victory points) or investing (the money making).

However when all players understand that this game is about hunting the red cards, it turns into a game driven by luck. This is rarely the case and you should have played this game very often to understand this.

The free computer game can enhance your skill very quickly.

Some cards - like the Mistress of Ceremonies - are off balance and gives players a considerable advantage when played early in the game.

This game is the epitome of unforgiving.  Mess up once, just once, and your game is over (against worthy opponents, anyway).  Hence, one poor choice can set you back significantly, to the point of no return.  This can be a bit annoying when it happens early in a game, since you more or less play the game out knowing the player making the poor choice is out of the running.

With this being said, I like the game quite a bit.  I've played it with 2, 3, 4 and 5 players, and I like it pretty much equally in all scenarios.  I.e., the game is very scalable.

can see it having the same problems as puerto rico, but I think the randomness of the cards at least give it some fun.  Seems a bit more interactive than San Juan becuase of the way cards are revealed and the first turn markers.  Can see this getting old though... have only played on the PC a few times, so in person might be differnt.

i'm impressed at how different each play of this game seems to be.

do i cash up and save for big buildings? or buy the best i can early and have no money early in the game?  and how do i make sure i have enough aristocrats at the end for final scoring?

a good balance of victory paths.

This game had me from the beginning.  I loved building up my money and points machine.  I discovered more problems with each game and now it is rarely played.  Mainly the problem is the illusion of choice.  There are lots of cards to buy with each turn but it is usually obvious which card to get.  Also there is virtually no way to come from behind and win.

The rules on how the cards come out are purposely written to make your life difficult, and overcoming this is the main point of the game.  For some reason that makes it feel contrived and unfun.

{3 play, all 4 player} Game play may be obvious once we all "learn" the game, and player interaction is definitely limited, but there's just something fun about this one.  Perhaps it's the colorful graphics and the fact that it just speeds along.  I suspect my rating might eventually drop a bit (along with how often this comes off the shelf), but for now, I'm digging it.

*** UPDATE 30+ PLAYS LATER ***

[upgraded initial 7 rating and bought myself a copy of the game!] Wow, how nice to be wrong.  Plays great as a 2, 3, or 4-player (though I prefer 2 or 4).  More depth than I originally thought, but not too much.  Wouldn't be surprised to be playing this years down the line now, albeit not as often as this crazy year :)

I think I like this game.  I wish (at least in games with more than two players) that aristocrats were worth fewer points, or more expensive, or something, as the winner seems to be heavily (though not completely) determined by the number of aristocrats collected.  Buildings just seem to cost a little bit too much for the benefit derived from them (or I'm just playing the game wrong).

It is, however, a good, fairly quick, not too heavy game.

Interesting for the first few plays perhaps, but overrated in general.  I like the "shopping" or "drafting" mechanic that drives the game; it's a breath of fresh air from the typical auction mechanics often found in light eurogames.  But it's very mechanistic and the luck of the draw in aristocrats matters far too much.

Too much calculation for my liking cloaked in a theme that makes me want to like it but is just thinly scraped on. Finely crafted game though.

My main objection with games like this is buildings that don't do anything unique based on their theme. All of them either give points or money. The Observatory if I recall actually does something kind of related to theme.

oh st petersburg, how do i rate thee?  it's a mathfest, i suppose, but i don't think the calculations are all that difficult.  the computer implementation is quite entertaining, or at least it was for a while.  it does seem like luck rears its head quite a bit, most notably with workers and certain aristocrats on the first turn.  it's not something i'm really prompted to play face to face.  i think this game would have really blown down some doors if it were packaged as the small deck of cards that it is.  big game, little box, you know how people respond to that with games like meuterer.

RATING: 6
This is a card game masquerading as a board game.  As a card game it is essentially a set collection game.  Player via to balance acquistions of Workers, Buildings, and Nobles.  The ultimate goal is victory points obtained from all types of cards (to various degrees).  Money management is essential and a poorly played round can take you out of a game.  The game has no mercy for errors.  The player with the least errors will likely be the winner.  A solid but tempermental feeling game.  [GTI Code: APSD]

One of my favorite lighter games.  This game is more addictive than it should be and I need to figure out why.

Plays well with 2-4.

With just one game played (not counting the 2-player at BSW) I like this, theme seems irrelevant leaving just what everything does to consider.
Position around the table may have a big impact, but I expect the way the tokens rotate and the dual market will compensate for that.
The biggest thing for new players will be the money shortage. How bad it is won't be apparent until at least partway through the game.

Saint Petersburg having players helping to build the city of Saint Petersburg. Rounds consist of four phases, with cards of that type being put up into play and players drafting cards until everybody passes, after which money and VPs are given for the cards of that phase's type in player's tableaux. Play until cards of one type run out, in which the round ends and bound VPs are given out. The player with the highest VP total wins.

Probably the quintessential euro-economic engine building game, even more so than Race for the Galaxy. The higher randomness and the player-driven phase structure of the rounds in Race means that its often better to accept some inefficiency just to leach off other players. Saint Petersburg seems to lack this same trade-off, since the round structure is fixed and in very round cards of every type will appear. Thus its better to go for the more efficient card possible. One the plus side, it's not too rules heavy (I think it's quite elegant for a game of this type) and isn't overly long. However, it strikes me as even more multi-player solitaire ('race'-like?) than Race for the Galaxy (although maybe I just not seeing how the interaction really work). I might want to get this, except I'm not sure of its balance and re-playability.

A good, light game. It shouldn't have won the DSP, but it should have dethroned Ticket to Ride for SdJ. It has luck elements, but these tend to balance out as the game progresses (unlike San Juan).

Enjoyed playing this one though can't seem to get the balance right between money and VPs. However, it does, it seems to me, have a runaway leader issue, in that it can become obvious from halfway through that someone has drawn out in front and then you feel a bit like you are going through the motions knowing that there is no way back!
Edit: can now see it as a super streamlined game with challenging decisions. It does have runaway leader issues especially if someone knows the game well, but it is a cracker.

*Update: After 80+ games I still like it and would still play occasionally. OK with 3 players, Very good with just 2 players (with 4 there is too much luck involved). *pdate: After playing another 4 player game, I have really no interest in playing this game again!

Another BSW game.  I like it.  I try to play it at least once every few days on BSW.  I have about 15 games logged and finally scored a win. It seems a little bland to me though.  Build green cards and build red cards.  Once in a while build a blue one.  Buy the observatory.  Draft more red cards.  Repeat.  The one thing that has kept me interested is the economics of the game.  I have a tought time balancing things out and experienced gamers crush me.  I'll keep playing and see where it takes me.

I enjoy this one, but it tends to frustrate the piss out of me.  I usually go a little nuts in the beginning which hurts me as the game goes on, giving me less funds to meddle with than my opponents.

If I could learn to restrain myself, I'd probably enjoy it more.

***UPDATE***
Nobody seems to like this enough to really suggest playing it (myself included), so I'm looking to offload it to somebody who will make better use of it.

The  game flowed easily, and shared some characteristics with [i][GAMEID=8217][/i] -- another game that I adore.  The goal in [i]St. Petersburg[/i] is similar: namely, to score the most victory points.  Points are earned by purchasing cards, which in turn implies that money management is also a key consideration.  The trick is in understanding the fine balance between developing your money-earning potential versus investing in point-earning cards.  I loved this tension in [i][GAMEID=8217][/i] and its progenitor [i][GAMEID=3076],[/i] so it comes as no surprise that I dig it here as well.

Unlike [i][GAMEID=8217][/i], there are four different decks in [i]St. Petersburg[/i]: Worker, Building, Aristocrat, and Trade (Upgrades).  Cards from each deck are made available during separate phases of each round.  New cards are placed in one of eight positions, [i]if[/i] there is an opening.  Do you take a building card that you don't want, so that you have the possibility of acquiring a noble in the next phase?  I'm not sure if these decisions are part of "Card Drafting," since I can't find a concise definition of that game mechanic.  Whatever it is called, it works well.

When any one deck is exhausted during its particular [i]phase,[/i] then the game will end at  the end of the [i]round.[/i]  Therefore deck management is important as well, so you can bring the game to a close on your  terms.  I've seen a similar mechanic in [i][GAMEID=491][/i], and I really like it.

Finally, I was able to bring this game to the table.  And it turns out that it is a bit of an administrative quagmire.  What BSW makes so easy is actually quite a hassle.  Making change all of the time.  Trying to remember all of the cost-reducing effects.  [i]Keeping track of the number of remaining cards in each deck.[/i]  The paper money looks [i]fantastic[/i], but substituting poker chips makes the process more manageable.  These details become easier with practice, but they are still responsible for a deduction of a full point from my rating.

[i]St. Petersburg[/i] is a deceptively simple-looking game with surprising depth.  It has many mechanics that blend together very well.  The two, three, and four player games all have different flavors, but do a nice job of maintaining the same level of tension (unlike [i][GAMEID=8217][/i], which in my opinion is best played with only two or three players).  That's two games named after saints that are winners.  If a game entitled [i]Sao Paolo[/i] is ever created, hopefully it will live up to the standard.

Wide options but a need to be flexible. Quick to teach and over in an hour. An awesome game. Works well as a 2 player.

Up'd to an 8. I like this game more each time I play.

OK times passes, years in fact. I have now played this over 100 times on line and predicatable, the experience isn't what it used to be. What is clearly apparent is that successful play is extremely formulaic. There is a clear rythmn to the game that needs to be followed. There are obvious choices and equally obvious actions to avoid. When playing the inexperienced their bad moves stick out vividly. However the big thumbs down is that the card draw, especially in the first and last rounds can decide a game absolutely. The luck of the draw is effectively a coin toss and I'm afraid it has diminished the game for me. 

I am obliged to reduce the rating once more. A game I will play and is an excellent progression for those moving on from Gateway standards, however once the mechanics become obvious, the enjoyment fades.

The woe continues. I am now actively bored by the game progression and increasingly infuriated by the turn of the cards when they aid one player and slap another in the face. There is far more randomness in this game than I ever realised in early plays. I have no real desire to ever play this again.

Up or trade/ sale with expansion.

Tight economic, resource management game. Played it a lot initially but it hasn't gotten to the table recently. Too many other options. I played this one after Ticket to Ride in my second gaming experience. It helped open my eyes to the gaming world. A game about rebuilding Russia? This sure isn't Monopoly!

RATING: N/A
Love Saint Petersburg! This is a great game of hand management with an interesting little economic engine thrown in. You have to balance getting those green cards for money with adding the building (mostly VP) and the aristocrat (mostly VP and money) cards to your ever growing collection. Fantastic game and I can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 6.5
This has come out a few times now as a 3 and 4 player game, but mostly with the same pool of players. It gets rated very high by many players in our group and I only got to it very late, having to catch up whilst playing strong opposition. 

p: I must say my appreciation for this game has gone down rapidly, and never been all that high to start with. I am amazed that it gets the rave reviews it obviously does. What am I missing? Sure, it's lovely produced, has clear, nice and interesting mechanics, but for me it lacks in all those departments that make a pleasant game a classic, at least in my book.

Somehow I feel that between victory points, development points (money), varied abilities and upgrades, and even the option to manipulate card-draw, there should be a much more intricate game on offer than the one I got here. All these ingredients and too often the same bloody cake. You know it's gonna be a cherry on top, how to get it there, and once the cards have determined who got theirs first slightly above the others, you might as well stop the baking as you're just playing on to confirm the one on top.

The thing I miss most are dilemmas. Which card to pick, how to hinder, how to progress, and along which path? It's not a good sign when all players look at the same exposed cards and all know what "you should do". Even more so when they are right. If turn one is obvious, fair enough, but when the cards turned over in turn 4 still have clear homes then I'm getting worried. I am even wondering if all the "different game ingredients" are too similar in effect. Money is too much just another VP in the making: it doesn't really open the door to alternate strategies, it just tells you how fast you can buy your VPs. The leader can just about always buy their way out of the dilemmas thrown up by their fellow players, and also, "buy" dilemmas for people trying to catch up who cannot react to that, each turn making the gap bigger and bigger. Once behind, against reasonable competent play, there is no way back.

First play reminded me of the very different Kardinal & Koenig (Web of Power). Not because of the type of game, but because it has a similar amount of game ingedients and rules complexity. Yet it does it so much more with it. On all levels, but especially on how to use the 3(!) cards available, and on direct player interaction. And compare how Puerto Rico's building abilities affect and open up alternate strategies, and then look at this one. It's not badly done, but a classic? Enjoyable, and one I will certainly play again, but highly overrated.

My wife makes me play this game every day since we got it.  I am not kidding about this.  That alone deserves a 10.  This is one of those rare game were simplicity hides a rather complex  set of decisions to make.

I rated this with the expansion as a '6'.  

This game had some depth to it, but it was really really dry IMHO.  So while I want to play it to try to win one more time, I also would rather play something with some more obvious "Booo-yah!" elements to it.

Looking through my geekbuddy comments, I have to agree that this game is probably one of those games that gets better with repeated plays.  Which makes sense because it's from the same guys that did Stone Age.

...which brings me to my one SOLID gripe against St. Petersberg.  The Aristocrat scoring grid.  Now, keep in mind my first game I got SOAKED on this, so that could taint my opinion...  but it seemed overpowerful.  7 cards was 28 points, 10 cards is 55 points.  Three cards makes the difference of double the points....really?!  With the expansion, each additional aristocrat card beyond 10 is 10 points each.  In Stone Age (same guys, same phenomena, so the comparison is warranted), 7 cards is worth 49 points, but it caps at 8 cards for 64 points (which for 6 cards is only 36 points, but there's only a limit of 2 of each unique set anyway...)  Which explains why there's all these "alternate aristocrat scoring grids" out here on the geek.  If nothing else, stone age came later, and I can't help but think there's some mea culpa in the fact that it's nowhere near as easy to get even 6 unique civilization cards.

BUT, sore-loser griping aside, if you're all playing on the same playing field...  it's just something you need to know.  12 Aristocrat cards scored once means the worthiness of the cards is about 75/12 6.25 points a piece--essentially scored once at the end, while a 5 victory point building is worth about 20 points if it lasts 4 rounds.  Man.  I think I've been bitten by the St. Petersburg bug.

I don't think I'll be buying this anytime soon, but I have to play it again. ;)

----------

EDIT:  More thoughts.  The thing is, even if you're ontop of your game, even if you've done everything right...  it's still most likely going to become an aristocrat race.  Which, considering two dueling masters and turn order, and money, and everything... would almost make the decisions too plentiful to really make much of a difference in what you chose, which I'm never a huge fan of (yet I like decisions.  Such an odd paradox)

The art work leaves a bit to desire, but we've surprisingly enjoyed the game play.  Buy enough workers to get the money engine going to build your VP generator while influencing enough aristocrats to secure a big enough bonus at the end to win.  Mostly play 2p which is competitively, quick; while with more players fewer but tougher decisions with higher tension.

Kaikki pelit BSW:ssä. Vain kaksinpeli kokemusta, joten pelikokemus varmasti hieman vajavainen. Kaksistaan pystyy paremmin suunnittelemaan omaa peliään. Useampi pelaaja tuonee kuitenkin hieman sekasortoa peliin, mikä on useasti omasta mielestäni hyvä asia. Tätä pitää kyllä vielä pelata useammalla hengellä. (25.5.2009)

This game I find to be very fun.  It's simple to pick up, and yet requires some good thought in order to become an expert.  However, since the the Aristocrat bonus points can be so high, all methods of play lean towards that path.  If there were consistantly multiple paths that could achieve victory, this game would rate higher.

Not bad, I'd play it again, but certainly not great.

There seems to be a large amount of luck in the ability to get what you need when you need it.  This is the largest problem with the game.  A better way would be a pool of open cards, with a track going to 8 that increases with each card grab, resetting every new phase.  When the track gets to 8, the round ends.

RATING: 8
Very good game. Played it most often as 2-player game, but also with 3 players and occassionaly with 4. When all players know what strategies might work, it is very challenging. Tried out different strategies (craftsmen, buidings, nobles) but can't say if there is one winning strategy. Depending on what other players are doing, a strategy either works, or doesn't.

A pretty fun economics style game. Well designed in principal, the turn order changing is nice especially. I don't mind the randomness, but my rating is lowered a bit due to some buildings that seem overpowered to me, specifically the observatory. Still though, a good fun game that plays quickly.

St. Petersburg is easy to learn and hard to master ( I am yet to succeed at the latter!) I think the strategy boils down to how to best manage your money, so it does not intimidate casual gamers as much as some more involved games. But with the ability to keep cards from others to mess up their plans, the possibilities are endless!

Only played this game using two players so far; that being said, this is one fantastic 2p game!  There are issues with some of the powerful cards getting snapped up early on, but that only ended up being game-breaking once.  There are some things (like skimping on workers) that can just put you out in several turns as well.  I think it's unfortunate that the rule book seems to try and over-complicate this; at it's heart, St. Petersburg takes only a few minutes to learn, but provides a lot of replay value.  Anxious to try this with more players, even though I suspect this will only serve to increase the luck factor.

Update: I am addicted to this game!  The dance between money and victory points, and when to switch your focus, when to take your cards into your hand, etc. is surprisingly challenging to unravel.  A lot of depth in this very simple game.  The only thing stopping it from being a ten is balance from the random element; for example Mistress of Ceremonies round 1 in a 2p game is just gg, and there's nothing you can really do about it.

Don't know why, but I enjoy this more than most other euros at the moment. Another game that I would have never bought had I not played it first at a con.  Quick playing without much downtime, and enough opportunities to screw others that I can get into it. I have a lot of trouble getting past the fact that most euros look very dry and boring in the pics on the box, even when I know it to be a good game.

Nice little money/point engine thing going on. Liked it enough after the first play to want to play several more times.

Overall, a good game with tight money - not too long and several paths to victory.

However, spoiled a little (like Dominion) by the fact that it can become obvious part way through who is going to win. There is nothing worse than playing out half a game with the positions all decided.

Update: After several more plays and with more experienced players I am still really enjoying it and there is a lot more tension about who is going to come out on top.

To my surprise, I enjoyed playing Saint Petersburg: the only reason I come up with is, this game is simple and unpretentious despite being an eurogame.

It surely ain’t thematic (and were it, I couldn’t care less about a game set in 19th century Russia), it has no dice and player interaction - i.e. open conflict - is impossible, yet there’s something here making this game appealing overall: I think it is because Saint Petersburg takes itself lightly, a merit so rarely found in the usually bumptious euros.

A good card game that works weill with 2-4.  I do like the expansion added to the game...gives a couple more ways to catch up as if you fall too far behind, it's really hard to catch up (at least for me).

Tried with the expansions and did not like the extended time or the cards.  Took those back out and sticking with regular St. Pete.  

Update...yep.  Regular St. Pete is where it's at.  I left in a handful of expansion cards (the Potemkin village like cards, the Czar Superstar).  But otherwise, still a great game and finally I have gotten to a point where I can compete.

Played on yucata.de. Once I understood how to play I loved instantly.

Must have!

*update*

Purchased and played on the table, even better. I have readed that getting 10 nobles is a winning strategy, that's when you play 2 players games. In 4 players games that strategy doesn't win always because it's very hard to get 10 nobles.

With 2 players is a different game experience, maybe good for learning but this game shines in a 4 players game because there aren't enough nobles for everybody and buying a good building in the right moment can be as good as getting one or two more nobles.

I love this game!

It's a balanced design, but, again, there's too much number-crunching in it for me for such a low return in fun factor. In a game among experienced players, it's all decided by the cards drawn.

This is the best of the Eurogames.

There are two major things I take into account when evaluating a game.  One is how easy the game is to play.  The other is how easy the game is to play well.  The best games in the world are easy to play and extremely difficult to play well.  St. Petersburg is as close to perfect as Eurogames get.

Clever card collecting game with VP and cash rewards. Neat mechanic with 4 decks doing different things. One for mainly cash, one for mainly VPs, one for people and one for upgrades. Cheaper cards if you already have one the same and plenty of upgrades where you buy the difference.

I'm still learning how to effectively use all the blue buildings, but I usually can hold my own in this game.  Aristocrats have nearly always been the key for me.  When I first started playing this game I had a strategy of buying a huge blue building early on and riding that VP machine the best I could, but then I take myself out of the Aristocrat competition and it is easy for a decent player to take advantage of that.  In a  game with newer players it would be fun to try again... hopefully I can bring this for the lunch crowd some times.

RATING: 7
Only one play under the belt so far. Made a fairly critical rules error, but enjoyed the game despite(?) this. Look forward to playing again (correctly this time) though the Games Played graph would indicate that interest might wane over time...
***UPDATE*** Played again (with the correct rule) and it was just as much fun. Assuming it's good for 10 or so plays, and considering how often we get an opportunity to play it, we shouldn't tire of it for at least 5 years...
***UPDATE*** Now down to a 7. Last outing was good but there does seem to be a processional aspect to the gameplay and I simply don't find it as engaging as I did previously (though still enjoyable).

But there is no comming back after a wrong decision at the start. And this will decrease the fun of new players.

Perhaps I'll upgrade this to an 8 later. I really enjoyed my first game, despite losing miserably to other experienced players. I think the mechanics are solid and I'm surprised I haven't played more games with some of these mechanics. I do think there isn't much player interaction other than purchasing things they may want. In a really long round about way, I prefer this game as Race For The Galaxy. Still, this is more than different enough that if I stumbled upon it used, I might be tempted to buy it.

Initally liked this one, but it doesn't hold up to repeated plays (for me). You are driven by the game, there isn't a lot of variety - the best plays are usually fairly obvious and playing non-optimal you will lose. Very hard to comeback from a setback. Theme is completely tacked on. However it does play quickly and my group like it so it will keep being played *** Update, dropped another point, many other games I'd rather play. **** Update, played some more, rating dropped again - traded away, never likely to play this again.  *** Update, rashly played it again with people who 'loved' it ... bleugh ... I'd forgotten how much I loathe this one, dropped another point, I'll never play this again.

I like this game, but my wife seems to like it even better and she always wins too. Too bad there is no interaction. It's obvious you need to get as many green cards as you can in the first few rounds of the game.

Essentially a card game packaged as a board game. Reminds me of Stimmt So which pulled the same trick. Still, it has some ingenious mechanisms and is certainly thought provoking and challenging. Having said that it's more in my wife's style than mine, with a a strong need to manage resources in view of a very limited a unreliable supply (luck plays its part with others being able to buy card before you, but there are enough options that you can balance out liklihoods with enough card counting and planning). I'm suprised at how popular the reports arefor this game. It's a good game I think, but not an all time classic by any means.

Es un juego bastante sencillo, de comprar cartas para ir evolucionando y conseguir dinero para comprar mejores cartas y puntos de victoria para ganar la partida. Tienes que tener en cuenta qué está comprando el resto de los jugadores..  y actuar en consecuencia. El juego tiene cuatro fases: artesanos (que permiten conseguir dinero, básicamente), edificios (que dan puntos de victoria), líderes (que pueden dar una porrada de puntos al final de la partida) y variado. Al final de cada fase (excepto la última), se aplican los efectos de las cartas (en cuanto a pasta y puntos de victoria).
Reglas sencillas, y bastante profundidad de juego. Es bastante matemático. Además, es un juego corto (1 hora aprox. jugando a cuatro jugadores).

RATING: 8
Juego sencillo de cartas, pero con bastante estrategia. Se juega por rondas y cada ronda consta de cuatro fases que corresponden con otros cuatro mazos: artesanos, que principalmente dan dinero, edificios, que principalmente dan puntos de victoria, personajes, que dan un poco de todo,y actualizaciones, que mejoran las cartas anteriores. 
Tras cada fase, hay un recuento y se cobran los puntos/dinero que corresponda, excepto la fase de mejoras.
El juego finaliza cuando se acaba uno de los mazos.

Es un juego muy sencillo de explicar, pero exige bastantes calculos y unas buena gestión para asegurar la victoria. A mi es un juego que me encanta.

The more I play other games, the less I like this one.  Going for aristocrats seems like the only viable strategy, so it often comes down to the card flip on the aristocrat turn.  I usually won't veto it if everybody else wants to play, but I'd usually rather play something else.

A nice change, as there is no bidding. Need to buy workers early for that tight income! I have not done well yet in this game, because I have been plastered by players who seem to have 'solved' the game. Those who get the observatory card will do well if it is used to its fullest advantage. Thus, the value of certain cards coming up early and being taken by the first player can create an imbalance issue.

At first I thought I would love this game, but it turned out to be rather monotone.

There is a runaway leader problem: An early advantage in income stacks up quickly and usually leads to victory. As an example, a first turn Mistress is very hard to beat. But it is not only the Mistress, it is at the heart of the game: if you get a better income early it sums up every turn. Because of that the game is not suited well for players of different skill levels, as the weaker player will just sit and watch how the other player is able to afford more cards to finally win by a huge margin.

Between players of similar skill the game can be tense, but it feels pretty much the same each time, as there aren't many different strategies to try and only very few cards with unique abilities (only the Observatory, the Warehouse and the Potemkin's village.)

This game was a bit of an obsession for me at one time. For a while the consensus on the 'Geek was that this game was 'solved' - that the winning strategy is always and everywhere to buy as many nobles as possible, ignoring everything else. I've since seen people win buying buildings exclusively, so I definitely don't agree that there's no challenge left here. 

I enjoy this game immensely, but I feel like I've hit a wall in terms of how well I do. Part of it is I'm dyscalculic, and there is so much in-head calculation in this game, i.e. "do I have enough money to buy this and still get some nobles in the noble phase?" I'm the kind of person who is constitutionally incapable of playing the Gnomes of Zurich in Illuminati, so in that aspect, mastery of this game eludes me.

Perhaps the quintessential economic snowball Euro.  Basically, you buy workers to earn income, you buy buildings to earn points, and you buy nobles to earn both.  Upgrades add variety and mix up the types (i.e. upgraded buildings earn money and points).  

The game boils down to "play a round, repeat until game is over."  I could see why others might think it too simple, or too repetitive, but for me, all of those are pluses - there is something very comforting and solid about this design.  The many timing issues and the constant need for economization beckon you toward strategic thinking, but the card draft always limits you just enough to stave off brain-burn.  The main challenge of the game is generating enough money in EVERY round to get what you want, and, overall, to ramp up so the switch from money production to VP production is as smooth and efficient as possible.  With two equal players, this one is very competitive.  Great stuff!  Too bad Tummelhofer doesn't do more straight-up designing - this and Stone Age are very solid mid-level Euros.  If you like Euros, get this one - now.

RATING: 6
What a weird game. Our first play was two-player, and from turn one I was the runaway leader. On every one of my turns I seemed to have advantage after advantage, and the advantages only snowballed after each round. During each scoring period, I acquired more and more money, until in my last few turns I had so much income that I started to get annoyed at having to count it all up. My opponent was also obviously annoyed that he had to sit there watching me count. 

By the last round I had nearly 150 ruples, eleven aristocrats, and more cards in front of me than I could count. I absolutely smoked the other player and I felt weirdly guilty for it afterwards. I don't know if this is just a problem with the two-player game or if I just got lucky, but seemed very odd to me. Not sure about playing this again...

UPDATE: Increased rating after multiple plays of the computer version (which I don't log). Very enjoyable. May be too fiddly FTF in comparison.

UPDATE: I have high hopes that the expansion might put this game right. After the time-wasting exercise that was Through the Ages and Scepter of Zavendor, I had a craving for a Saint Petersburg that was better-balanced. But until the Judge/Mistress of Ceremonies problem is fixed, this will remain unplayed.
---
This was fun for a number of games, but it ended up crashing very hard. The problem was just extreme imbalance in the cards on offer. A first-turn Judge or Mistress of Ceremonies virtually guarentees a win, if you can play minimally competantly for the rest of the game. Buildings are much too underpowered. As a consequence there are much too few ways to approach the game. These are mistakes Knizia would never have made.

In the end its sort of like a book or movie with a horribly contrived ending. You read it, and are enjoying it, but when you get to the end it's so bad, you can't even look back on the first half of the book with fondness. Such are my feelings for Saint Petersburg - a game that was clever and sucked me in for a while, but when I realized how unbalanced it was, it ended up being much more frustrating than if the game had simply been obviously unbalanced from the get-go.

One session of St. Petersburg reveals that it is another example of meticulous German boardgame craft.  St. Pete may be too dry for some, but it compares favorably to other similar games, like Puerto Rico.  In fact, I like to think of St. Pete as PR with less set-up time, which is why I've given it a higher rating.

We never finished our four player game, because there are other more interesting games there. This is after one play. I won't play this excuse for a game if I can help it. Bleeechhhhh!

This was a hot one for me when I was new to the hobby but oh, oh how it has fallen.

It's not that anything is broken so much as the game just feels cold and wholly mechanical. It's pleasing to build an engine and watch it go, but why bother when there are so many games that do that and so much more? There's no tension or suspense here.

And, it has to be said, it doesn't take long before plays become scripted. The order the cards come up in doesn't make for enough variety of play, so after your first few games you'll find yourself playing on autopilot.

Have played this several times.  Beware, with new players this game has a serious runwawy leader problem.  With experienced players bad choices are punished.  I like that there is still some luck involved in which cards will turn up.  I really like this as a 4 player but 2 works.

RATING: 6.4
Takes a while to get really competitive at, but once you get to that point, the game plays you rather than you playing the game.  The decisions become tedious after you become familiar with the game, especially in a four player game, where often I feel as if I hadn't made a decision for myself the whole time.  A lot of scoring actions makes this tedious to play over the board if more than 2 people are playing.  Because this is wrapped up in Euro game clothing, people seem to think that this is more than a card game.  These people should see a therapist.

I finally got to play this and I really liked it. I've now read about the balance problems and that the game doesn't hold up over time,  but hopefully the game gets to a number of plays before that becomes a problem. I can only rate based on my current enjoyment, and that's a lot.

I think just playing a game with low rules overhead after a spate of modern euros was refreshing.

RATING: 8
Wicked, wicked fun.  It is very dependent on building a good, operational financial engine at the beginning without falling too far behind on points.  But everything balances out nicely.

The "final scoring" bonuses from the different nobles makes the end-game a race to see if you can get the tenth noble, because if you don't someone else will - and the ten point difference could make or break your final placement.

RATING: 5
I found that often my actions were limited as options were used up.  I think it plays better with at least four.

I played this again with some players who were new to the game and found that they did not connect to it very well.  I think the teaching can make a huge difference (it need to be clear in order to be enjoyed).

I've only played this online, so my rating might change with an actual tabletop play. All in all, not bad, but nothing shocking. When this came out, I can imagine that it deserved a lot of love. Collect cards and play cards to build up an engine of money and points, and manage that engine to the end.

At this point though, there's a heck of a lot of card games out there, and this feels pretty ho-hum in comparison. I like the online play, but I can't see myself picking up this game.

The more I play this game the less I like it. The observatory always seems overpowered. There are only two real strategies: buildings or aristocrats. There are no real tactics because the person with the first pick just buys the best card. It feels very mathematical. I'd rather be playing San Juan.

This seems, after one play, to be more about timing (tempo control, turn-count manipulation, the switch from expansion to exploiting) than about economy building.

Although we liked this game right away, we played it about a dozen times before feeling comfortable rating it.  At first it seemed that whoever got ahead in green cards always won.  We have now gotten familiar enough with the game to work different strategies, which makes it alot more exciting to play.  If we play several games in a short time period, it becomes repetitive, but it's an excellent choice for once in awhile.  We have only played 2-player.

(12-10-10)St. Petersburg is a dry exercise in engine building without the engine. The only interesting decision to be made is when do I stop trying to make money and start buying points. That and a little tactical drafting game that is about as interesting as tic tac toe.

Old comment: So far disappointed with this game. We got it because we read that it is a really good couples game. So far, it has fallen flat. I don't know why. Maybe we just need to give it some more time to appreciate the depth. Update: This game loses a point every time I play, rather than vice versa. Ug.

Unenjoyable.  It is a collecting game with very minimal forms of interaction, heavy front loading of the economic system built into an economic snowball game, and a great lack of either charm or grace.  Avoid.

Solid game that is enjoyable in a two, three, or four player environment.  I tend to prefer either two or four slightly more than three due to a more even distribution of roles.

1 play. Pleasant. Superior artwork. Update 2 years later put into pungent pros and cons: Pros, I like the variable strategies and processional ease of flow. And the art! Cons, this is yet another Eurogame featuring an efficiency competition, making an X Engine, then converting X to Y.  Can you achieve the highest ratio of X to Y?  Minimize your costs, maximize your benefits. There's some interaction with the competition for rare Engine parts (widgets as serfs, buildings, nobles) that influence my efficiency ratio up or down. Someone is getting tired of efficiency engine games. But... this issue of Accountancy Aesthetics, and my taste aside, it's still a well designed game in my opinion.

RATING: 4.5
Maybe it's because I got utterly crushed (nearly 100 points behind the other players), and maybe it's because I screwed up at the beginning, but whatever the reason, I just wasn't that impressed with this game.

I feel like the biggest issue (at least for me) was that the engine that you were building just wasn't all that interesting.  Scoring never felt very satisfying, as it just boiled down to some cards you had, plus that end of game bonus (which I messed up).  IN addition, I played with an expansion, as well as with only three players, which made the noble board seem ridiculously overpowered.  Getting unique nobles seemed way too easy (if you had played the rest of the game well) as you often had a ton of choices available.

I feel like I might bump this game up a notch or two with the following differences next time: 4 players, no expansion, not being an idiot the first round.  That said, unless it plays substantially better, I don't see this rising much higher.

Very good game with fun mechanics...one round and four sets of cards that only score during each phase of the round.  It is basically a card game that uses a board to keep things organized.  Can have it's frustrating moments, but overall is worth playing. This one has grown on me.  My rating went up from a seven to an eight.  Games have become far more tense and interesting.

RATING: 8
First Play, 2-player:
It was an easy game to explain and we had the rules down pat within a round.  As play progressed, the subtle interaction of picking up cards or playing them vs. creating more empty spaces is intriguing.  I look forward to more plays.

Biggest gripe is a runaway leader problem.  I think between evenly experienced players, this will be less of an issue, though that may devolve into a scripted opening.  My bigger concern is introducing this to new players and most likely crushing them in that first game.

Nice snowballing engine game, even if I never seem to win.  I like the tight economy at the beginning of the game.  My biggest concern for this game is if loading up on nobles is the dominant strategy.  If not, then this game is prone to group0think, which would only raise its ratings (once I figure out how to exploit it).

I was originally quite impressed by this board game masquerading as a card game. At it's most basic level, it's an economic game where one needs to establish engines early in the game to begin the growth cycle, which snowballs over time. 

Despite being pure chrome, the thematic touches on this game made me smile when they came up and probably bumped the rating up slightly, namely the Potempkin village which builds inexpensively and upgrade at a higher value, and the Czar (Peter) who functions as all 4 types of workers for the purpose of upgrading. 

However, this game eventually hit the dirt at 3, down from a high of 8 as I played it out. The game seems charming when you first sit down with it, but it reveals itself to be pretty basic, and very easy to 'mechanize' oneself to after repeated play. I don't claim to be able to play this optimally by any stretch, but I know enough about the game to not have a lot of difficult decisions to make in any given game, which is one of the main things I enjoy about gaming. The rating on this just kept dropping and it's now to the point where I am avoiding playing it on an actual table and haven't dusted off the CPU version in months either. I will warn anyone who has yet to play this on the CPU: If you enjoy it now think twice before hitting it on the PC, the play speed will ruin you on the table top version forever. (and incidentally: I feel the people trying to compare this to PR or San Juan are reaching a bit, at the most bare basic level, yes, they are both games which feature economic frameworks which you need to exploit to get victory points, and have some rule bending involved, but I don't think the parallels are anywhere nearly as tight as people make them out to be on here)

I initally rated St. Petersburg an 8 but after several plays it dropped to a 4 due to its mechanical, processional, and very limited gameplay.  Revisiting the game recently, I lowered the rating another point because I realized that St. Petersburg represents everything I _hate_ about European games- chiefly limited choices that deny the possibility of creative play, meaningless themes that have a tenuous-at-best connection to the mechanics, and lack of replayability engendered by repetitive strategies.  Some will argue that  St. Petersbug doesn't show any of these traits but for me it does.  I consider this to be one of the poorer European games on the market despite its consistently good ratings.  Nonetheless, it should be played a few times to get a feel for it since it is a functional and somewhat impressive design from a mechanical standpoint despite the fact that there is only one successful strategy that will provide consistent wins. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The cards are attractive, and I could see this as a decent gateway game.  St. Petersburg shines as a simple, solid resource management card/board game.  Personally, I enjoy more meat to my game, but I wouldn't usually turn this one down.  Playing this for more than 40 minutes is unacceptable.  It's not rocket science --- or even long division.  Wives, take notice.  :)

This game may be very good but my first experience taught me that there is only really one strategy- go for gold THEN go for victory points. I suppose it should have been obvious but I ended up experiencing how razor edged ths game an be. If you get behind with money you end up behind with VPs. I was winning up until the final scoring then I ended up 10  and 30   points behind the other players flat last because I spent too early on buildings and aristocrats. This is a game of refining one strategy rather than having multiple possible successful startegies.

RATING: 7.6
Scheme: Card game where you buy buildings. The buildings provide money and/or victory points. Winner is who has more victory points.
The scheme is so simple that's almost frightening. It has been done so many times that's exhausted. You must try to exponentially increase your earnings turn after turn until you switch to invest in VP buildings. The game works due to the original mechanism for drafting and buying cards, which is the only original thing in Sankt Petersburg.

After some plays, I'm afraid this game has little replay value and you can play it without a brain. One all players have enough experience, the winner is determined by chance. However looks like I'm addicted :-)

One game came down to the final scores being withing 1 point. Those games were very enjoyable! On the whole, a fun game

Fairly algorithmic. Take the cheap workers, get them in sets. Buy the point producers. Block your opponents from getting too many distinct nobles.

Still, not that bad.

Sint Petersburg was an early acquisition in my gaming 'career': my girlfriend and I played the game when we were at Spiel in 2004 for the first time, but waited until the Dutch edition hit the market. I can't remember much of our early attempts, but given my sentiments about this game, a lot of the 'theory' behind the strategies we pursued must have been faulty or even plain wrong. As a result, the game has been stuck in a dark corner of my gaming cabinet for a very long time. I could not sell it on as my girlfriend has special ties with the city upon which the game is based, so it kept on gathering dust.

Fast forward a few years, when an acquaintance of ours dug his copy ouf of [i]his[/i] cabinet, and invited us to play. I did so with some reluctance: snowball engine and vague memories didn't make me truly enthusiastic. But I persevered, and didn't do too bad in the end although I made some stupid errors. It felt a lot more natural to assess the path I had to take to get the engine up and running, and so could dispell a few myths which I had allowed to cloud my judgment. For one thing, there is no truly dominating strategy in the sense that you should always focus on one make of card. Do that and you'll probably lose. Sint Petersburg is much more about being flexible with what you're given as well as what you plan to do in the next few turns. Failing to recognise opportunity as well as some basic rules of hand and money management will result in loss. What [i]didn't[/i] change was the feeling that the human players are attempting to solve a sort of optimisation puzzle. The subject matter isn't carried over well into the main mechanics, let alone the game material. All that matters is the price per VP for every action you take. I won't say it is easy to transform your money engine into a point engine as the game progresses, and will say that there is plenty of opportunity to hone your skills here—but in your mind it remains a matter of rational economising and not of constructing a city in the middle of a mosquito-forsaken swamp.

My previous rating was a little too harsh. The engine is fairly clean and fairly straightforward and thus simple enough for me to grasp, even if many subtleties elude me for the time being. In the future I'll probably not be as adverse against playing this game as I was, but at the same time I'd rather play titles with a bit more story arc or drama in them.

One of the family favorites.  Great couples and family game.  The other members in my family have probably played this more than myself.  My most played game my first two years on BGG.  Dominion has replaced that title on my third year.  A great introduction to snowball type games.

2009 update - Still enjoy this game quite a bit.  Think the expansion was a nice addition.  Besides all the new options it brings, it has toned down the cards that give a clear-cut advantage:  Observatory, Mistress of Ceremonies, etc.

I always have a game of this going on Yucata.  Gives me my optimization fix.

I enjoy this quite a bit. Both on yucata, 2p with my wife and 3p.

Solid mechanics, med-low complexity, tough choices, constantly short on cash. Takes a few play thrus to get a sense for the cards, but that's what I like about it - you want to play it again and its short enough that you can. Actually this is one of the few games where I feel like the length is perfect. You see it coming, you know its coming, you can feel it coming - and when it gets there you're ready for it.

Despite an initial misunderstanding of a rule during our first play, we were really pleased with the game and surprised that it isn't as complicated as a first read through the rules might suggest.

It puts her to sleep.

Although I'm certain this game would be improved face-to-face, I just find it to be deadly boring.  Buy a card, then pass.  And pass again.  And maybe again.  Oh yeah, and pass.

This is an economic engine game where you must build up your rubles to buy cards that will get you more cash but also buildings which earn victory points.  Nobles give a mixture of benefits, including points at the end for having a variety.  Lastly you have opportunities to "upgrade" your cards.

I just can't grasp how to play this game well - even when I mimic my opponents I lose.  Which would be forgivable if the game wasn't so dull.  This is an uninteresting card game with a pasted on theme, and I have no desire to try it any further.

One of the best games for two players. For 3/4 it's also tough, but it's a bit crowded and 1st player advantage is too great. It's better to "wave" the turns (i.e. in a 3p game go 123321123) to amortize the benefits.

Michael won from behind with 8 different aristocrats.  I still had 3 authors that I'd never been able to upgrade.  First strategic win for Michael - good score of 99.
  Never enough money which makes all decision telling.  ANd realizing this makes you realize later what could have been done differently - and yet there are just so many choices to make all with seemingly good arguments.

Over the years St. Petersburg has become one of my favorites. I have come to really love the "manage how many of the next cards will appear" aspects of the game. In some respects, this game is far subtler than many of my other favorites. I find that the priority of Noble acquisitions varies significantly between 2 and 4 player games.

St. Petersburg is terrific game. Works nicely with 2 players (good game for couples btw). Very simple yet elegant, and I really love the artwork by Doris Matthäus.

This game is a great game.  There is so much to keep track of.  I love the economic element, making sure you have enough money for each round so you can buy what you need.  I love the element of planning ahead to make sure you can get an option to buy something in the next round.  It has a lot of things to keep track of and is a lot of fun.  We always play it with the New Society and Banquet Expansion.

Components: I didn't initially like the artwork, but now I do. Good quality cards.

Experience: Getting a money engine going early is crucial, leading to the board becoming clogged with over-priced buildings. It's fun to efficiently buy and upgrade various cards. Missing being able to purchase a card by just a dollar at the crucial moment can be devastating. The end can come suddenly.

RATING: 10
Another of my most favorite games.  This game is extra special for me because I have visited Saint Petersburg and have seen most of the upgrade buildings in person.  I think the game not only plays well, but gives some insight and peaks the curiosity about a city that many people know very little about.  The game plays well with two three or four players but the strategy is very different with two players than with three or four.  While there is sometimes an element of luck involved for similarly skilled players in a two player game, I find the game to be continuously challenging in that there are always many options to get the victory and choosing correctly is a key part to winning the game.

This game plays well when all players know the game. A new player is likely to miss some strategic early decisions and fall hopelessly behind.

Simple?  Maybe.  But that doesn't mean that it is boring.  As a player, you are always involved in the game--there is very little downtime.  There are subtle and indirect ways to interact with your opponents that keeps it from being multiplayer solitaire, yet you still get to build your own engine without disruption.  

There is that point in the game where you have to decide when to stop growing your economy (money) and start gaining prestige.  Figuring out when to do this is what makes the game so much fun.  

It plays fast, is appropriate for gamers of all skill-levels, and still draws in "hardcore" gamers who like something with a little meat on its bones.

Fun card drafting game.  Seems very balanced and not too long for what it is.  Would certainly enjoy more plays of this.  

I don't like the endgame as well as I do the rest of the game. More often than not, the last turn can screw you, if the cards you need don't come up, and you're left with all the cash, that is basically pointless (worth only a few measly VPs). Perhaps there is a way to hold cards in your hand just in case, but the penalty if you don't play them is just too severe to do this. 

It would be nice to see some varying strategies too. In every game, players focus on mainly Workers (Green) and later Aristocrats (Orange), while building very few Buildings (Blue).

Given how highly this game seems to be rated and recommended, I was surprised at how simplistic and one-dimensional it is.

There's really only one primary path to victory:  get 10 different aristocrat cards. If there was any other viable path to take, I'd rate this game at least a 7... since it does have some enjoyable mechanics.

Often, trolling through older games which have high ratings has yielded good results for me. However, this one was disappointing. I recommend London as a much better game of a somewhat similar style.

A Euro faction building game that's light, short, and pretty fun at first, but repeated play exposes problems quickly.

St. Petersburg is very fun to play in
the beginning, but as you learn more and
more about the game, it seems as though
you can only make mistakes, there aren't
too many different ways to win, so it ends
up coming down to luck of the card draw.
I think there are two broken cards, the
"Observatory" is too strong, and the "Mistress of Ceremonies) 18
cost Noble card that gives you 6 money
and 3 victory points is too strong too
if you get it early in the game.

A card game that pretends to have some theme, when it clearly has none at all. It's just a bunch of nonsensical rules mashed together somehow to hold up together the game engine, which they do pretty alright to be fair, but the game they make, is a boring one. It's hard to better the following conclusion by the user "sisteray": "Overall, I liken it to having sex with a corpse, it gets the job done, but it leaves you a bit cold."

RATING: 7
The game lost some of its shine once everyone over studied it and knew all of the good cards and got the game play down to a science.  When this game was new, it is very cool.  I liked how simple and intuitive the game seemed.  Once I learned that some of the cards were very unbalanced, I was disappointed.  I'll still play, but I'd rather not play with the people who know all of the cards and have done the math to figure out which ones are better.

The game also lost a bit of shine when I saw how getting the Mistress on your first turn can often win you the game.

RATING: 6
There is a very good game in there, but it is not fun.  I mean, a game should be more than tough economic choices and never having enough money to do what has to be done.  I have a love/hate thing going with this game, but probably won't suggest playing it unless someone else really wants to.  Oh yea, there is good balance and a lot of interesting strategies and choices.  All it lacks is fun.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. Easy to learn and relatively quick to play. 

I suspect that strategic choices are more limited than they first appear as money seems to be very important early in the game so the early choices really come down to where one earns it and when one switches to concentrating on victory points.

There also seems to be a bit of a runaway leader effect in the two player game, so an early bad decision can easily cost you the game.

I could never get tired of playing this amazing game. The figures and pictures, that is the design seen from an over-all point of view is really nice. Always fun, but that doesn't mean that there's some sort of tension since the beginning of the game until one of the 4 stacks runs out. Be careful not to compromise yourself buying too much buildings you can´t afford. Try to collect as much workers as you can!! Nobles are always welcome at my side.

Pretty good, but felt like it was missing one thing.  Felt too distant from other players.  Not sure what would have made this better.  Knowing in advance how many turns a game will last helps immensely.  (4 player game lasted 7 or 8 turns.)

RATING: 6
Good light-weight euro-game.  Repeated plays have forced me to lower my rating a bit (started as a 9) as the replayability is low.  There is really only one strategy, collect Aristocrats since their scoring value is so high.  Since all players pursue the same strategy, you are really at the mercy of good cards coming out at the right time.  But for some reason, it's fun to play this game once in awhile even though the decisions to be made have become scripted.

Eventually Coolstuff hosted a gaming get together known as "OGA Con." It was mostly attended by locals, but individuals from various other parts of Florida also came to visit and game. It is at this event that I ended up meeting Eric, who ended up being a frequent gaming partner after this point, as well as a few other individuals who I have come to know reasonably well.

The first game we played at OGA Con was Saint Petersburg. I ended up being severely underwhelmed by it. It might have been that I was unable to really appreciate it at the time, but nothing really stood out to me about the decision making structure of the game.

RATING: 8
Players are attempting to construct St Petersburg through the purchase of craftsmen, building and aristocrat cards.  Each card only scores (money, victory points) during it's "turn", so timing of purchases is crucial, as is managing the money.  Cards can be upgraded out of a special deck.  Nice purchase/drafting system, some special ability cards and discounting rules to keep you thinking.  Bonus points awarded at the end of the game for unique aristocrats.  Very brutal game on an early error (lock in your income first), and sometimes you can do nothing about it forcing you to watch someone run away with it for an hour. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I tried it once so far, really liked it, the components are gorgeous, although I'm not a huge fan of the paper money.  For the lightness of the game, the administrative tasks were a small burden at times (we sometimes forgot to pass the markers or rotate the card stacks), but I think this will be easier on the second play.  Kelsey enjoyed it too and we're looking forward to trying this again.

Update: I play this a lot on yucata, and I like it.  The only problem is that with players of unequal skill, there can be a run-away leader problem, which makes the end-game drag a bit.

Appears to have a runaway leader problem, but a lot of neat mechanics in this one.

Well-balanced, attractive, and great for a gateway game. You could do a lot worse for an middleweight game. It's a simple drafting game with investment decisions galore. You trying to create cash flow to pour into victory points.  However it falls short in terms of tension, creativity, and interaction. The most interaction you get is the procedural grabbing stuff before others can, and it lacks the combo-licious possibilities of San Juan. I think I'd be a tough competitor at this but it's not a design that really interests me.

It's of that older German ilk, where the rules and presentation are dead simple, and that can be refreshing at times.   It's also very "pure" to use another over-used descriptor.   Your basic engine building game.   It has obviously been supplanted by more interesting variations on that theme, such as Race For The Galaxy, but I can see why this was popular in it's day.  Everybody seems to agree the game suffers with 4 players since Noble scoring becomes overly emphasized, and that was very true in our 4-player game.

Kipróbáltuk hárman ezt a kártyavezérlős, remek kis játékot. A játékban minden fordulóban 4 fázisban gyűjtögetjük (vásároljuk) a kártyákat, melyek magunk elé helyezésével építgetjük a várost. Gyakorlatilag vagy a bevételünket növelhetjük vagy győzelmi pontokat szerzünk, esetleg mindkettőt egyszerre. A pénzügyekre érdemes odafigyelni, mert gyakorlatilag csak két olyan fázis van, ami után tőkéhez jutunk. Mi gyakran jártunk úgy, hogy a következő forduló első fázisára nem nagyon maradt pénzünk vásárolni. A játékban kézműves, épület és nemes kártyákat szerezhetünk (az utóbbira érdemes odafigyelni, mert a végelszámolásnál különleges a szerepük). Ezen kívül vannak még a fejlesztő lapok, amiket érdemes begyűjteni, mert nagy előnyökhöz juttatják a tulajdonosukat. A játék 3 fővel kissé elnyújtott volt (két fővel még hosszabb lehet), de 4 fővel valószínűleg hamarabb véget ér a játék, hiszen a végjátékot valamelyik kártyapakli elfogyása indítja el. Az első benyomásom alapvetően pozitív, mert a szabályok nem túl bonyolultak, még a nagymama is képes volt vele játszani (a 7 csodával nem sikerült neki), remek családi játék (inkább felnőtteknek), egyszerre kell stratégiázni és taktikázni. A szerencse szerepe jelen van, hogy épp milyen kártyák bukkannak fel és ki milyen pozícióban van abban a pillanatban, ezt próbálták meg orvosolni azzal, hogy a kezdőjátékos jelzők fordulóról fordulóra vándorolnak a játékosok között. Egy negatívum volt amit majd a következő játékok alatt még megfigyelek. Aki az elején "szerencsésen" tudott vásárolni, az előnyre tett szert, amit végig nem sikerült utolérni, persze az is lehet, hogy csak én játszottam szarul :). Alapvetően egy ajánlott családi kategória, a játék során folyamatos a sikerélmény és a játékosok között minimális az interakció, maximum annyi, hogy ki jut hozzá másokat megelőzve a jobb lapokhoz. (2014.05.01.)

Kipróbáltuk négyen is. Rövidebb volt, de mivel most már négyen gondolkodtunk sokat :), így nem tűnt sokkal rövidebbnek. A játék újrajátszhatósága magas. Érdemes odafigyelni az első fordulóban. Nem szabad túlköltekezni. Ezt el is mondtam a többieknek, majd szépen túlköltekeztem, s hoppon maradtam a második forduló elején :). Összesen egy ember tartotta be a javaslatot, majd mivel mi többiek nem nagyon tudtunk mit csinálni a második forduló elején, ő szépen felvásárolta a kézművesek nagy részét és olyan pénzügyi fölénybe keveredett, ami döntőnek bizonyult. Tehát részben beigazolódott a gyanúm, hogy aki az elején előnyt szerez, azt nem nagyon lehet utolérni, másrészt az is beigazolódott, hogy bénán játszom :). A nyertes stratégia egyébként - hogy egy kicsit spoilerezzek - az volt, hogy az épület kártyákra nem nagyon koncentrált, inkább a kézművesekre és a nemesekre. Kíváncsi leszek a következő játékban mi lesz a nyerő stratégia. Egyébként még mindig remek játéknak tartom, de csak a felnőtteknek és AP (analízis-paralízis) gyanús. (2014.05.02.)

Didn't liked it too much. Wasn't very impressed. Boring. Low interaction. Understood it more or less. You got to collect different cards. You got different colored cards with it's own uses. Which colored cards are better and why, don't ask me, I finished last in my game. Economic card game.

Some cards are better than others. If you want a specific card and another player takes it before you, it can hurt your game if nothings else interests you. If you fall behind early, it can be hard to catch up.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

I don't plan to play St. Petersburg any time soon.

I suppose it's not that bad of a game, but I'm baffled by the high ranking. "It's short!" seems to be the main drawing point of the game.

The other supposed virtue of the game is the "multiple paths to victory". Unfortunately, it's not very well balanced and attempting a "building" strategy will usually fail unless the player gets very lucky.

Competitive card game where players invest in cards for maximum return as the game progresses. Cards provide cash or VP during their active phase only, leading to an ebb and flow of income throughout the game.

This is a thought-provoking, engine building card game that rewards careful planning.  The cards in this game aren't terribly well balanced.

Very enjoyable and challenging game.  Great for 2-players and no "special" adjustments or rules for 2 either.  Mystery Bob asks to play!!  It is engaging and brain-burning but not overly taxing.  It also plays faster than our other favorites and that is what we need right now in our lives.  Thanks to amwiles and jeffwiles for twisting my arm to buy this!!  Kisses for you both!!

UPDATE:  Another play with the Banquet cards mixed in.  Well, no surprise, that Mystery Bob got the BEST cards and killed me!!!  I didn't do too badly and had lots of rubles at the end, but no unique aristocrats to spend it on!!!  Still a "10" but the Banquet is not a "10" for me!!  I'll have to wait to rate it!

UPDATE:  Played with the New Society cards/rules and will never play without them.  Still a "10" and the New Society is also a "10!"

UPDATE:  Played recently after a very long time.  We still love this and I still can't beat my husband!!  

Played 4-player with Mamadallama and her husband.  Mystery Bob and I taught them the game.

Visually appealing game with some interesting mechanics.  Often poses difficult strategy decisions; requires flexibility if random factors do not favor a pre-conceived strategy.  Recommended.

When playing 5 (using the expansion) the game seems to be unbalanced, as there are not enough green cards to buy (in the 1st round), which means that 3 players end up having 2 cards and 2 players just 1 card (for a total of 8).
This is a problem as it seems to be fundamental for the whole play.

The card play can give rise to the perception that there is a "luck of the draw" but in my experience, that's the challenge of the game - to manage the situation as it unfolds. However, gameplay after a while becomes mechanistic and unengaging.

Had not heard of this game.  Someone mentioned it in Boston over a game of Brugges.  At least I waited a day before it made it to the collection, and another 2 days before I played it.
Seems that there's a point at which if one player takes a lead, it's hard to be caught.  It's a game that presents different opportunities each play.  SO whilst one generally strategy may work, the specifics will likely vary in response to the cards that become available in any one game.  That's the fun part:  having to quickly work through the options to optimize the scoring potential.

One game - got stuck with almost no access to aristocrats - despite mitigating actions like clearing space or using the Observatory - so there is a bit of luck in the card and player orders.

nb - need to check the expansion for base game errata

[2 plays]  First time I played this I rated it a 3.  It was a rotten experience.  All I remember is that the seating order and random events resulted in my not being able to get any of the important kind of cards (probably workers), and I spent most of the game feeling like I might as well not have been at the table.

Six years later I played again and had a fine time.  The game teacher gave us some good advice (buy two workers right away no matter what), and it wasn't the horrible exercise in futility that I remembered, but a fun and interesting game.  It was sort of a happy medium--it made enough sense right off the bat that I could function semicompetently, but throughout the game I also had further insights into the game dynamics and how I could do better next time.  All in all, glad I'm in a turn-taking game group that made me play again.

Great and tight resource management game. One of the best ugly games in existence. It does take 1-2 plays to get into though. Saint Petersburg is one of those games that if you mess up in the beginning and spend your money too early, you're practically out of the game. And this [i]will[/i] happen if nobody tells you.

It must be mentioned that the base game comes with some broken cards, which have been fixed with the expansion.

RATING: 8.5
Scales well from 2-4, recommended as a medium weight economic game for gamers.  Basically uses cards and money similar to San Juan, and is a game of economic management and logistics.  Decision making can be incredibly nerve racking, because it requires very careful and agonizing choices in money management: do you invest money in trying to increase your income, earn immediate points, or focus on long term end-of-game points (aristocrats)?  A very tight and tense game!  One weakness is that early mistakes in a 2 player game will cripple you by allowing a runaway leader.  The game usually lasts 6-7 rounds.

The expansion changes [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/350100]five cards[/url] for balance.  Recommended modifications are Czar/Carpenter (costs 3 instead of 8, and gives 2 rubles instead of 3), Observatory (costs 8 instead of 6), Mistress of Ceremonies (gives 3 rubles and 4VPs instead of 6 rubles and 3 VPs).  See also Tom Lehmann's comments in [thread=412907]this thread[/thread] explaining the changes.

Banquet is considered okay, but New Society is considered essential and must-have!  Randall Bart: "The New Society is a good, well designed expansion. Unfortunately, in the same box you get the Banquet expansion, which is a silly expansion from Spielbox magazine. Four of the Banquet cards break the game; they turn a well crafted play experience into a chaotic mess. It would be better to roll dice."

Ugh, I really didn't like this game. The decisions started out fun and meaningful but dried up about half-way through. Then once everyone had their paths to winning, it came down to who got the good card pulls. I hate games that make you feel helpless, and I felt completely helpless in this game the way the cards fell to my opponent every time he was start player. He couldn't help but acknowledge his good fortune. [i]Oh look, you got a good card when you were start player but I got a crappy one when I was. You're good at this game![/i] 

That may be fine in a shorter game like Incan Gold, but this game is way way too long to have it determined by turn order that you can't influence and luck of the draw. Can't help but think of a variant where you can buy  start player tokens away from someone instead of buying a card such that if you are last and have nothing of real value to purchase, you could at least purchase the start player token for a future round instead of the tokens just going around the board.

I don't know why, but I always want to play this game.  I don't even usually win.  It's dropped a bit for me over the years (this used to be a 10 for me).  Mostly dropped because I'm not as much of a fan of it with 2 players, because it seems too easy to get your economic engine working with not enough ways to mess up or block your opponents strategy so the decisions aren't as tough when doing 2 player, but with 3 or 4 players this game has great tough decisions from round 1.

No auctions, which is a plus for me-- most of the hot new German games seem to feature auctions.  I just bought my copy, and haven't been playing as much, but it's always a quick one to play that doesn't require excessive time strategizing what likely next moves will be.

 Downgrading rating. The more I play, the more simple luck of the draw seems to determine the winner. If I'm first and a good card comes up, great. But if I'm first and all the cards that come up are garbage, or all equal so that going first is irrelevant, I'm screwed, as my opponent(s) will get lucky when they are first.

Too difficult to catch the leader. You need to play this first before you can play it well. Nice game, but only one route to victory. *** Down rated from 7 to 6. I can't believe I made the same f#@*ing mistake again!! The first time I played this, at Essen, I bought this stupid f#@*ing building for 2 roubles which totally screwed my game. Through the whole game I was 1 rouble short of doing what I wanted. This time, I said to them "Last time I bought this stupid building right at the start and through the whole game I was just 1 rouble short! I must make sure I don't do that again." What do I do? I BUY THE SAME F#@*ING BUILDING AGAIN!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHH! So I spend the whole f#@*ing game going Pass Pass Pass becuase I have no f#@*ing money and I can't f#@*ing buy anything at the right time to get me more f#@*ing money so I can win the f#@*ing game. My stupidity aside, I still think this game is spoilt by the rich getting richer and there being just one route to vistory. But I'll play this again and try to do better.

On BSW, when I'm looking for a quick 10-15 minute card game I can think of nothing better.  There are times to take gambles, and other times you are forced to take cards you don't really want.  A good balance even though the winning strategy is often the same path (or best related to the amount of players).  A fun game that's even better when played with two.

Grade: A- (2 players)

Up to an 8 for now, could sink back to a 7 -- hard to say. Has strange appeal.

Excellent!  Played twice last night and we enjoyed it thoroughly.  There are quite a few interesting mechanics in this game to make it different enough from the usual buying and building genre.  We saw in both games that it is possible for a player to run away with it if the luck of the draw favors the bold.  Will play again regardless.  **UPDATE**  Runaway leader problem is being confirmed: the rich get richer and after a few turns, the poor get the picture.  Sadly not much can be done to hold back the affluent.

I've played this a few more times than my recorded plays suggest.

I see the early stages of engine building in this old game, and how it influenced others, but boy is this dry.

I like the mechanic where all your cards of a particular type give you their bonus in that phase, so there is no 'activating' a particular card.  Grabbing a card into your hand to prevent others from getting it is also good.

Other than that, I just felt like I was getting money to buy cards that game me victory points, and that was that.  My only interesting choice was whether or not to grab a card into my hand.

Update:  A couple years later it's still a family favorite and my girls, now 13 and 14, still request it.  Enough said, it's a 10 for me.

  It's fun how quickly your economy builds up through a bunch of small, card buying decisions.  It's also great how the income and victory points are generated throughout the turns.  The game is always giving you something to work with.  It's light enough to be a family game but has and economic feel.  The artwork of the game really pleases me as well.  As your playing area becomes populated with cards you'll be focused on money but you'll also get to enjoy the games look and color scheme.  The card artwork is full of busy craftsmen, bug-eyed quirky aristocrats and fun drawings of historic buildings.  The artwork gives a whimsical personality and a feeling of life to an economy building game.  
     I prefer it with three rather than four, and use poker chips instead of paper money.  I'm not interested in it as a two player game.
   

Ok: I thought the poker chips were out of theme so I made a set of wooden coins with the paper money artwork on them.  Now it's perfect, it just needed a geek effort on the components.  It's and easy to learn economic game that doesn't take long enough to get boring.  My daughters 11 and 12 years old request it.

RATING: 4
Recommended by my Geekbuddies... (15 ratings, 7.92 average) - Comments based on BSW play: St. Pete is an investment game. Players start with some cash, which is used to buy cards that either produce cash or victory points. The cash that the stuff bought produces is used to buy more stuff. Repeat until the cards of one of the four decks of stuff is exhausted. The twist here is in the turn order, which can make or break you depending on what card appears when. If the turn order is against you, you'll be unable to buy anything good. The randomness in the game should be manageable, and players have some control over turn order, but with no way to predict what's coming up, the luck factor increases. It's an ok number-crunching middlewight game, nothing more. *** UPDATE: After more plays F2F, on BSW and with the freeware PC app, definitely a 6. The luck factor is very strong with 4P. I get frustrated with the card draws, and it doesn't help that the whole game is unmitigated card draws. A bit better with 3P, and best as a 2P game (which I'll never get to play F2F). Still, there's not a whole lot I can recommend here. At times, it St. Pete is just downright boring, sort of like a financial investment exercise where you have minimal control over what is available to invest in. F2F is a bit fiddly with all the money flying around the table every single turn. It's really not a bad game, and I'd play most of the time (especially on BSW or on the PC where I don't have to deal with the cash) but it's not a middleweight of choice for me. Removed from my wishlist. *** UPDATE: Now completely burned out on St. Pete. Nothing more to explore, and every play feels exactly the same as the last. The lack of depth is so glaring now, I can't even look at the cards anymore. I still can't believe this won the DSP. Dropped to 4.

RATING: 5.5
Saint Petersburg is an economic game. To improve, you'll need to learn when to buy and what to buy, and when to switch from upgrading your snowballing economy to buying victory points.

The experience is excruciating: you're always out of money, constantly trying to save money and invariably having to spend all your money to buy expensive cards.

Like this:
[b]A:[/b] What are you doing?
[b]B:[/b] I'm saving to buy...
[b]A:[/b] [i](interrupting)[/i] Gosh, don't you know piles of money in hand are dead money?
[b]B:[/b] But I want...
[b]A:[/b] [i](as above)[/i] You should be using it to buy more...

Great game about... SPACES! All you have to take care for is the spaces: empty slots on gameboard, available spaces in your hand, spaces in other's hands.... I even could name this a "Space Management Game".
Well designed, fast paced, good with just 2 players, but excellent with more, nice artwork... What more to ask for?

I'd heard a friend of a friend really enjoyed this game, recongnized the MT connection, so I picked it up. First game was with my brother (actually, the true first game was against myself :] ). Like Stone Age, the mechanics of this game are founded in incredibly simple math. You spend money to build your economic engine, and then at some point (over the course of the game really) you turn that economic engine into a points engine. The system works really well, but we didn't have a lot of fun. I would like to give this several more tries in fact; I feel like I am missing something.

- nagyon jópofa mechanizmus
- viszonylag pörgős játékmenet
- mérsékelt interakciós lehetőségek (ki mit visz el a másik elől)
- gyenge tematika
- számomra csúnyácska grafika
- és végül egy felmerülő konkrét kérdés/probléma: a kék épületek túl gyengének tűnnek az árukhoz képest. Lehet, hogy függ az erősségük a játékosszámtól, mivel kevesebb játékosnál tovább tudnak pontot termelni...?

Tetszett, szívesen játszom vele újra.

Jópár játék után rá kellett jönnöm, hogy nem igazán szeretem. Valahogy nem tudom élvezni a játékot, ami talán azért is van mert most úgy érzem, hogy nagy a szerencse szerepe, ami nagyon ügyesen el van ugyan rejtve, de attól még nagyon nagy súllyal van jelen.

Kartenmütterchen Russland überdauert die Zeiten und schafft es immer wieder auf den kalten Wintertisch von Doktor Flundi Schiwago. Die Neuauflage des Klassikers ist eine visuelle Lieblosigkeit aus dem Photoshop mit Kickstarter-Eitelkeitsgesichtern.

I first gave it a 9, but over time as I understood how to play it, it has settled to an 8. Our group really loves it and considers it a solid game. Not great, but far from "ok."

St. Petersburg is a quite simple card game concerning the construction of the grand Russian city of St. Petersburg in 1703.  The Byzantine-like artwork gives this game its own unique charm.  Gameplay is quite interesting; you have to balance the collection of your workers (for cash), buildings (for VP), aristocrats (for cash, VP, and end game bonus), and traders (for improvements).  There are enough choices to be made on what cards to develop, so the luck factor is very small. I thoroughly enjoy this game!

I've played quite a few games of this now (by my standards), and I can see the implications of the moves I can make, and understand how you can mess with the available spaces, and I really think it's a beautiful design - every move you make depends on what your opponents have done or what they can do. It's surprising that so much depth arises from rules that are so unrelated to their consequences.

Furthermore, I love the Russian theme - so much so that I've made some effort to find out about St Petersburg and Russian history.

St Petersburg is a game that continues to entertain.  I understand the complaints, but they are easily resolved by placing specific cards (Mistress/Judge)in the bottom half of the card stacks.  I find that St Petersburg offers a fun filled, tense 45 minutes. Scales well from 2-4.

UPDATE:  St. Pete is a solid 8 for me, in which I doubt it will ever climb or drop.  I understand many of the complaints in which people claim this to be a system rather than a game with real decisions, but I have yet to over play it to the point that it has become over thought.  I believe moderation in number of plays, and time between each  allows for more longevity with this title, as it never goes through the aforementioned scrutiny.  Because of the points raised in my wondering thoughts St. Pete has remained a game (if the higher value aristocrats are placed in the lower half of the deck) that flurishes through intutive play. I think St. Pete scales well, but is best with 3, 2, and 4 respectively.

Da vi fandt Saint Petersburg frem for nyligt var det en stor fornøjelse at blive mindet om hvor godt det spil egentlig var. Kan det spilles med en vis hastighed holder det i den grad vand. Skulle man spille med en ny spiller eller måske fire spillere ville jeg nok være mere skeptisk, men kan man holde et vist flow (hvilket den konstante håndtering af pengene kan være en udfordring i.f.t.) er der bestemt tale om et herligt spil, der stadig kan være værd at dyrke.

From my Secret Santa 2005!

For a while, it was the only game my wife wanted to play since I taught it to her and I'd catch her playing the PC version about every other day.

By rights I shouldn't have this rated so high with the runaway leader potential, and game breaking cards if they come out too early.  For some reason I still love the game, so why fight it?

Still not convinced that there is much to this.  Being the next to pick when the good cards come up seems to provide a significant advantage.   However, it's fun to make the best of what comes your way.  UPDATE:  I played it again recently after a long hiatus and bumped my rating up 1 point.  It's a really well crafted card game - a pure "economic engine" game without a lot of fiddly crap tacked on.

I bought the expansion - I guess it's a keeper for me.

Upon looking in the box, my first thought was, "This isn't my type of game.  I won't like it." However, I immediately found it to be very fun, even if the strategy was foreign to me for a few rounds at least.  It plays super quickly, there's some pleasant luck in the cards, and fortunately the money is of thicker, better quality than, say, the money in Hermagor (which is just garbage).

Very fun but tense 2-player game.

Got this for my 2007 birthday in the Tin Soldier sale. I like the depth of this game, and the multiple paths to victory (at least to my newbie eyes). Plays very differently with 4 (where getting to 10 aristocrats is really hard) compared to with 2 (where 10 aristocrats is a given, and you have to get an edge through buildings).

Confession: I find the PC AI hard to beat on the normal setting.

An enjoyable game for few sessions, but loses it's charm rather quickly after that.

Fast and fun.  Lots of pathways to victory, though a pure building strategy doesn't work.  Initially were playing a rule wrong - we were moving unbought cards immediately to the bottom row, rather than doing it only at the end of all 4 card stacks being done - makes the game at least 1 turn faster, and is to its detriment!

RATING: 7
Good euro resource gathering/VP conversion game. Set up your money engine in the first few rounds in order to score the bigger VP personalities in the later rounds. Suffers from a significant luck of the draw factor in the order that cards are come out, particularly in the early game - which can set up one player better than others.

All the bits are very good. Rules are well set out and clear. Good despite the potential early game luck factor.

RATING: 6
Fun game that can really haunt you in later stages of the game if you don't manage your purchases wisely.  I think it is quite a good looking game as well, with a nice Eastern Orthodox influence to the portaits and the use of metallic gold.  I think I enjoy it most with 4 players.  Not sure why people contend that the game is shallow or overrated or unbalanced.  There are good cards, and there are bad cards, but there is also the changing turn order, and that is key.  I will say this, I have played this enough now that I think I can trade it, so there ya go in terms of replay value.

Saint Petersburg is a well designed game, which a perfect relation between quality and difficulty, that can be played in less than one hour and scales correctly from two to five players. I often use this game as a "long filler" since can be explain in less than ten minutes but has a lot of room for tactics and strategics. As I dont own any pure fillers, Saint Petersbourg is a handy game to use in short sessions. The expansion for five players introduces new cards and it is a nice adition to a very good light-medium game, I own it but I think is not really necessary unless you want to play the game with five players. Fully recomendable specially for beginneers and casual gamers while it is still good and demanding for the gamer. It is really good with two or three players and when played fast is also a wonderful "long filler" as I said before. And remember, collect these green cards and make some money early in the game or you will be soon bankrupted...

While St Petersburg can be a close-fought, intriguing game, the random factor ruins it.  Yes, you balance managing your income and your points.  But nothing beat getting the "right" card when you are first to choose from that pile.  In theory his balances out across the whole game but in practise the small advantages add up.  Also, those who understand the intricacies of the game's mechanics will gain a distinct advantage when trying to put together a series of moves involving discounts, moves to hand, and increasing the overall value of their portfolio in terms of income, points and end of game points.  There is little variance in this game.  You must play it as efficiently as you can, occasionally interrupting the other players' strategy for bettering their economy or end game points.  When it comes down to it, you either buy a card, place it in your hand for later or strategically pass.  Normally the turn order determines who gets the better of each round.  And each turn's benefits are determined by the random draw of cards.  Not one on my must play list.

Solid game with deep strategy. If you like depth in your games, St. Petersburg is a great choice. Some games seem to take forever to play, with progress creeping at a snail's pace; others seem to whiz by a bit too quickly. St. Petersburg strikes a nice balance. From the beginning you can see the pieces of a strategy coming together that you can follow to the end, and players immediately begin jockeying for position on the board as they amass victory points. It's a good game for a small gathering of friends who like to chat and socialize as they play.

A game of timing, staying flexible, and evaluating odds.  Once everyone has learned the flow of the game and is able to avoid the common traps, the outcome will sometimes come down to luck of the draw.  But in the meantime, interesting decisions present themselves, and there's much fun to be had.  I'm puzzled that St. Petersburg is often described as "light," since it requires detailed calculation, and since mastering the pace of the game requires some sophistication.  I'd say it's a fast-playing gamer's game with a fairly high luck quotient.  Playing the PC version repeatedly has ruined me for face-to-face play.  St. Petersburg is rotten with four players in my opinion; too little control and aristocrats are wildly dominant over buildings.  It plays well with two or with three.  The PC version is only good with three players, since the AI is not suited to playing head-to-head.  Even with three players, I win over 85% of the time, but at five minutes a game it was my timekiller of choice for many months.  Other than not playing with four players, my only suggested tweaks for the game are to disallow the Mistress of Ceremonies from appearing in the first round of play and to remove the useless Mariinskij-Theater from the upgrade deck.

RATING: 7
This is a card game with a board which is addictive and fun, but at the same time feels a little formulaic. I don’t have a good grasp of the game, but my impression is that much of the game is about timing things, like getting the cards and having the money at the right time. As for now, I am positive about the game, but I need to play it a few more times to solidify my opinion.

RATING: 7
Eight plays, including two with the New Society expansion and one with my own mix of New Society and Banquet cards. Attractive and addictive middleweight in which you must develop a philosophy for how to spend your rubles. The player interaction is indirect, but there is some there. Unfortunately, once you get a few games under your belt, you tend to follow a pattern; I wouldn't say that it stops being fun, it just stops being *as* fun. 

By the way, I'm not usually one for variants, but if you're not playing with the New Society I approve of the one where players shuffle the Mistress of Ceremonies back into the deck if she's revealed in the first round.

I'm splitting my rating on this into a few different catagories:
2 Player: 9

4 Player: 7.5
I think it's an excellent 2 player game in which your buying decisions can directly influence your own card availability in the next round.  I feel this adds enough of an extra level of tactics to boost the game up.  For 3 players I think it's a bit unbalanced by a single player getting 2 markers.  Depending on which two and when, it can be the difference maker in games.  For 4 players it's more balanced again, but you have a problem in influencing card availability for yourself.  Often buying really only benefits other players and delay between turns can drag on.

RATING: 9
Played 20+ 2,3 and 4 players. Plays in 80 mins, 60 ish for 2 players. I like the theme, employing workers to generate money, using money to buy buildings for prestige and taking on aristocrats who might generate a combination of money and prestige. When to buy which is the strategic element to the game and which of a given type to buy is the tactical part. It will not take many games to settle on a strategic plan but the short term choices are enough to keep the game interesting for a few more plays. New players never buy enough Nobles. To balance things I advise that you award less experienced players 5 or 10 rubels more starting money and make it compulsory to take 2 builders in the opening phase. There is no catch-up or rain back mechanism in the game so maintaining a balanced between different levels of experience needs this artificial intervention *UPDATE* After a dozen plays this game is proving to have more lasting appeal than I first presumed. *UPDATE* After 20 face to face games and 100+ games on the PC I feel that the game is solved. I play identically to equally experienced players so there seems to be complete agreement on the best way to play this results in a game among experienced players being rather dull and a game including inexperienced players makes me feel awkward because they stand absolutely no chance of winning. I have really enjoyed reaching this point with St P but I now feel I want to move on and spend the time playing something else. I'll leave it rated at a respectful 8. March 05

*UPDATE* Just played my 29th game and a new player won against experienced players. Having the expansion cards (not the purple ones) in the game might mix things up enough to throw out my view of formulaic play always winning. Back up to a "9". Sept 2014

This game should really be called Runaway Leader: The Game, as the game's mechanics SCREAM it.  The first couple of games didn't seem to have much player interaction, but it became more apparent as things moved on.  It's still highly random; more random than it really appears at first.  If you make a mistake or get screwed early on, you're probably not going to catch up.

RATING: 10
This is one of my yet another favorite games. Awesome for 2, tough with 3, even tougher with 4. Get your money, build your buildings, appease your aristocrats. The balance is very fine. One might think, that because the aristocrats bring points at the end of the game, that's the key to the game. Although certainly there's truth to that statement, I've seen people win with less aristocrats and with just the power of blue buildings. 

Don't underestimate the blue cards. They are powerfull, give you an early edge and if you get the right ones, will put you ahead very quickly, and make it harder for others to catch up. 

Very enjoyable game. Nice theme, even with pictury graphics. Conning and tense. Really worth getting and keeping it in your collection.

I don't know why it took me so long to try this game. I guess it never sounded appealing but it was actually a lot of fun and offers a similar enjoyment to Dominion.

Update - dropping it to a 5, don't feel like pulling this out again. 

Very nice game, although the influence of other players on your strategy is very limited - basically whether they buy cards that you want. Thus it is really a solitaire game with multiple players. Good idea to use poker chips with this one as there are cash transactions every turn.

RATING: 7
At first, I thought it was simply the best card game I had ever played, and the minimal luck factor was a big plus. Now, years and a few more plays later, I think maybe the luck isn't so minimal (although still small), and my suspicions on a serious rich-gets-richer problem were confirmed and even surpassed. Often you can see who will win after the first few turns, and if you fall behind, you are basically out of the competition. The below average artwork doesn't help, either, but I still enjoy the game.

rating after 1 play.  didn't really figure out the strategy for this one until too late.  i was very ho-hum about this one, thought i'll give it another chance.  i started to like alhambra after more plays, and in my mind i think of them as similar in weight and strategy/luck ratio.

Update 2007-02-02 - Played a 2-player game with my wife and I had a blast!  I must have been comatose first time I played this.  Nice light card-type game with some luck of the draw but lots of options.  My wife seemed to like it pretty well too, which is like a glowing review.  May have to buy a copy of this one.

Great little card game, nice & simple with a good feel. This one is surprizingly hard to nail down, given the simplicity of the arithmatic. Up'd my rating after a few games with the New Society, is a very nice expansion. We never play with the purple Banquet cards anymore though.

RATING: 3
Clever and potentially interesting. The endgame aristocrat scoring seems to be the deciding factor, though, which narrows available strategies. The tightness of your money seems challenging and interesting rather than frustrating, and that's always nice. I would prefer it if aristocrats weren't so powerful, and it would help if it were not ugly as sin.
[EDIT] Yeah, the scoring is just too screwy.

Takes a while to wrap your head around it.  Then it just keeps getting better!

Very rigid game though.  There is a right and a wrong way to play.  Make one mistake early, and you will lose.  It's kind of addicting though, the way an old video game like pac-man or galaga is.  You are trying to get your high score, and you know if you make one mistake, it's all over and you'll need to try again.  This makes the game very tense, and you'll want to play again to do better.

Ok back down to an 6.5 after more plays.

I want to like this game, I really do.  The system is tight and it is fairly well balanced, and it uses a lot of mechanisms I like in other games.  

BUT

1.  No interaction -  bought it first, take that!
2.  No theme - could be rethemed as anything.
3.  No replayability - get gold, get VP.
4.  Kingmaker issues - situations where you need to take a card to prevent the person after you from taking it.  Sitting after the newbie is a huge boon.
5.  Really only one good strategy - get money, get people, score veeps.

All those complaints aside, its a solid economic engine game, and your first play will be a lot of fun.  A lot of the mechanics remind you of Through the Ages, but without the interaction, theme, and multiple strategies.  Its mostly a timing game.  The upgrades provide a little depth but overall there isn't much there.

Maybe after more plays, I will start to see the game open up a bit more. I like Stone Age better, but I can't really level any specific complaints against this game.

RATING: 10
Fun game, easy for novices to learn, and has great replay value.I played this game several times in a row, and have some thoughts on strategy:- The Observatory building is a great card to get -- you might guarantee yourself victory if you get both of them.  It is especially useful early, when you can use it to get new workers while other players are struggling to get cash.  Later, it is better for getting upgrades -- building cards or aristocrats that produce lots of money are the best.  Only use it when you have a space left in your hand (or money and upgradeable cards).- Don't forget about the point value for variety of aristocrats!!  If you have 9 different aristocrats already, the next one is worth 10 more points, and may be your best play!  There are only 7 types in the aristocrat deck, and 3 are rather rare and expensive -- 2 are Mistress of Ceremonies, 2 are Judges, and 3 are Controllers.  So the key to getting variety is to get some of the 10 more in the upgrades deck.  The cheap upgrades are best, of course:  there are ones costing 6, 8, 8, and 10.  The Weapons Master costs 8 and brings in 4 rubles/turn, and the one for 10 brings in 5 rubles/turn -- these are critical and affordable ones to grab.- Cash management is critical!  You should try to get cards that will earn you rubles in rounds other than the worker rounds.  Earnings in the aristocrat round can easily equal earnings from the workers, and will allow you to buy more upgrades.  Upgraded buildings can bring in lots more cash, which can help you get more aristocrats.- Hand management is important.  Don't put big, expensive cards in your hand if you can't collect enough cash to play them in the next round or two.

Rules question:  are players allowed to look through the discard pile?  It's more of an issue when a player has the "Black Market" expansion card -- do they get the right to look through the pile at any time, or only at the time that they play the card?

I play St. Pete relatively frequently. There's a fair amount of strategy to it, but probably an equal amount of luck. What comes up when it's your turn to buy first on a particular type of card impacts the game a lot and is something that's typically difficult to have much control over. It's playable in about 45 mins or so, which makes it a good starter or finisher for a session. Overall quite solid.

A remarkable design. Seems like a simple economics engine game at first, and it is, but the game has a rhythm that makes it special. Timing when to take a card or let it sit has subtle implications that will affect the next several rounds. Managing your tiny hand of cards can be quite nerve-wracking. There is no other game quite like it. Time has only made it better in my esteem.

[Initial Impression: 3]
After initially reading about St. Petersburg, I was quite interested in it, but placed it in the "try before buying" column, and am glad I waited.  It does have certain features of a game I should like, and I even gave it a second chance after an uninspiring first play.  But, if there's a game that I would use to illustrate a "dry" game, it is this one.  It's a completely calculational exercise, with players simply determining future income and point values for each card as it becomes available, and that calculation is almost always the same for each player.  Those card values seem completely arbitrary and therefore uninvolving, uninteresting, and meaningless.  Pick any set of numbered cards, use that as the income or point value, assign costs, and you could easily play a similar game.  My second game was a little more interesting than the first (which I attribute mainly to the people I was playing with the 2nd time around), but it just isn't something I could ever look forward to playing again.

Saint Petersburg is a nice card collection game, forcing players to carefully budget funds to make the best of the opportunities the decks offer them as the game progresses.

I can definitely see there's a lot more in this game than what I encountered on a 1st 4-player solo play, and that's only to the good- players need to control the cards coming out, as well as the income and VP coming in, while still collecting a good swath of noblemen to be successful here.

Because the income is limited to rounds where your cards produce, it's nice to have income every round, but at the same time it may be necessary to sit back and watch some rounds so the money is there when needed.

I'm starting this clever little Euro at a 7, but it has a lot of plusses and I expect with play it will go up from there.

The game has no critical interraction between players, has a large measure of chance, and seemed like "parallell solitare" to me.  I find I cannot be excited by it.

Got it for christmas - very keen to try this but I think I should thoroughly read the rules first. It seems one of those rules-sets where 'the youngest player gets an extra card' and 'the oldest player is administrator'

By that I take it it means one random player gets an extra card, everyone manages the money and pieces

Definitely looks like it's best with 4. We played with 3 and it took some getting used to, in the early part of the game the cards seem like they don't really do much but its the cumulative benefit... Next time I should buy more workers and trade them up asap. Not many traders were coming out though because players were passing in other rounds. This mechanic grew on me as the game progressed as it meant certain card types were scarcer.

Only other slight gripe with the game is that it doesn't really feel like much actually happens, it feels repetitive and the cards don't interact with each other much they just sit there accumulating points. Other games that last this long you can actually feel like you are doing something through the game and the decisions imposed on you can be quite hard; this had neither.

It's ok and I think it could grow on me but we'll see.

Played a second game of it and we realised we were doing one or two things wrong. This has to be one of the worst written rules sets of any game.

Nonetheless I now understand it a bit more and I think I quite like it. Balanced multiple paths to victory and lots of interaction between players and between cards.

My initial rating was low due to personal factors, but this game has grown on me considerably.  It's really quite thought provoking.  I still have one major complaint, though:  it's a card game with a board included to drive up the price.

RATING: 2
After one play, I like it! Fascinating card-driven game, where you are buying cards in each of four rounds per turn. Cards can get you income, victory points, income and VP, or upgrades, depending on where you are in the turn. One can use the limited income to buy more income-generating cards, or to buy VP-generating cards early on, but it is clear that the one who focuses on income-first will inevitably win the game, with a surge at the end. Simple mechanics, but somewhat convoluted enough to make it difficult to explain the first game. After that, it simply makes sense. The game flows nicely, although our first game took over 2 hours. With experience, this should fall to 60-75 minutes, tops, with ultimately reaching the published 45 minute mark. Lots of game for so short a timeframe. I'm looking forward to the next game.

Update (09/18/10) 3 plays: This game has been seeing a lot of gameplay lately. However, whomever can get that extra worker card/upgrade early on, be it from poor play by the player to the right, just by the luck of the draw, and/or table position. That 3 ruble delta is so critical that it seems to snowball into more income, and finally more aristocrats for the point surge at the end. The same goes for the other decks; there are some cards in them that are game-breaking, such as the observatory. Perhaps manipulating the number of slots along the upper row, in order to control how many new cards appear is critical. What to buy and what not to buy is also critical. Still, one cannot shake the frustration that some player position is always predestined to win.

Update (10/10/11): The more time passes, the more 'meh' I feel about this game. Yet another economic snowball exercise. Leave me out of it. Downgrading to a '7' from '8'.

Update (01/14/12): I am resonating with a number of users' comments who have rated this a '3' or a '4': Economic snowball, seating position critical, lack of meaningful choices (simply decide which card is better than the other), sheer luck in the draw of good cards. I have no compulsion to play this game anytime soon, and fellow geeks have articulated why. Downgrading to a '6'.

Update (05/31/12): Finally, traded it off to a friend as a farewell present. He will enjoy it more than I have. Most likely, will never play this ever again. Downgrading to a '3'. This game has had a very short half-life--nosediving from '8' to a '3' within 24 months.

Update (11/19/2014): Done. Haven't missed it in over two years. Downgrade to a "2".

Played it twice at Capclave 2012. First time I was a bit overwhelmed and lost but the second time (still got my pants beaten) I came to enjoy and appreciate it. It's a good game although it seems that, while it's technically not the only way to win, getting many fame cards is really the best strategy.

RATING: 6
If you use 4 pair of 10-sided dice to track victory points, if you use the "phase marker cards" instead of the "wooden markers", and if you rewrite the rulebook in 2 dinA4 papers, you can throw away the original board, rules and wooden pawns. This way, the whole game (sleeved cards+money+rules+dice) will fit in a small metallic card coffin, for optimal storage and portability.

Found it hard to get excited about St. Petersburg. It just feels like Yet Another Euro. There's some thin theme -- which amounts to little more than "we chose Russian art instead of Egyptian or Japanese" -- over a humdrum economic engine. You need to figure out how to generate resources efficiently and then figure out when to switch over to generating victory points.

There's nothing particularly bad about it but it just left me meh. I'd generally rather play Glory to Rome if I'm going to play a 45-minute card game.

Hamar nagy kedvencemé vált. Szeretem a mechanikáját és szeretem azt is - amit egyébként sokan hibának rónak fel - hogy nincs benne sok konfliktus a játékosok között. Ennyi játék után persze kijön a hátránya a szerencsefaktor, hogy milyen kártyák jönnek fel, de ettől függetlenül nagyszerű játéknak tartom. 

A Sankt Petersburg társasjáték az orosz Péter cár idejébe kalauzolja a játékosokat. A játék kártya alapú és a mechanizmusa különböző kártyacsomagokra épül, minden körben másikat kell használni, így mindig új lapok kerülnek játékba. Ezek a különböző paklik a következők: munkások (kézművesek), épületek, nemesek és az úgynevezett cserekártyák (speciális lapok).
Kezdőkártyák segítségével kiválasztjuk, ki melyik kártyacsomagnál lesz kezdő, és az ennek megfelelő fa jelzőket szétosztjuk. Kezdéskor a részt vevő játékosok számától függően 4-8 munkáskártyát felfordítunk és elhelyezünk a két sor felső részén. Ezek után minden játékos kap 25 rubelt és kezdődhet a játék.

A játék több körből áll, amely körök 4 fázisra oszlanak. Ezekben a fázisokban mindegyik paklit egyszerre használjuk a következő sorrendben: először a munkások, majd az épületek, a nemesek és legvégül a cserekártyák. Annak ellenére, hogy különböző típusú kártyákat használunk, mindegyik fázist ugyanúgy kell lejátszani: először a játékosok akcióköre következik, amely fázis alatt az alábbi 4 akció közül kell választani: 

- Vásárolhat egy kártyát elveszi a tábláról és kifizeti érte a kártya bal felső sarkában jelölt árat. Utána elhelyezheti maga előtt az asztalon.
- Elvehet egy kártyát a tábláról és a kezébe veszi. A kézben tartható lapok száma maximum 3  de amit így vesz föl a játékos, az nem kerül semmibe. Így lehetősége lesz fölvenni egy kártyát úgy, hogy nem kell azonnal kifizetnie, csak később, ha ki akarja játszani.
- Kijátszhat egy kártyát a kezében lévők közül úgy, hogy maga elé rakja és kifizeti az árát. 
- Végül a játékos passzolhat, vagyis nem csinál semmit.

Egy játékos egyszerre csak egy akciót hajthat végre, de ennek a fázisnak nincs vége azzal, ha mindenki elvégezte a maga akcióját. Addig folytatódik, amíg mindenki passzol. Így annyi akció hajtható végre, amennyit a játékos akar (vagy amennyit a pénze enged).

Ha mindenki passzolt, pontozás következik. Attól függően, hogy abban a fázisban épp melyik kártyatípust használjuk (munkások, épületek vagy nemesek), a játékosok megnézik a maguk elé tett lapokat. Tehát a munkás fázis után csak a kézműveslapokat értékeljük ki, az épület fázis után csak az épületlapokat értékeljük, a nemes fázis után csak a nemeskártyákat. A cserekártyák fázisa után nincs értékelés. Mindegyiken vagy rubel van vagy győzelmi pont esetleg mindkettő. A megfelelő típusú kártyákért mindenki begyűjtheti a pénzét és hozzáadhatja pontjaihoz az jelzett győzelmi pontokat is. Minden fázis utolsó mozzanataként új kártyákat helyezünk a játéktáblára úgy, hogy végül megint 8 lap legyen elérhető. A felső sorban lévő kártyákat alulra toljuk és a felső sorba tesszük az újakat. 

A játékban a „szűk keresztmetszet” a pénz. A játékosok állandóan pénzszűkében vannak, így a legkedvezőbben, a legtöbb haszonnal kell elkölteni a rendelkezésre álló pénzt, vagyis legolcsóbban leépíteni a legjobb lapokat. 

Fontosak a játékban a cserelapok. Ezek lehetnek akár munkások, épületek vagy nemesek, különlegességük az, hogy a játékos előtt lévő ugyanolyan kártyákat upgradelik. Különösen fontosak a nemes cserekártyák. Ugyanis a játék végén még van egy értékelés. Mégpedig itt az kapja a legtöbb pontot, akinek a legtöbb fajta nemese van. Alapból ugyanis hét fajta nemes van, de ha beszerzünk azonos típusú nemesből többet, majd azt upgredeljük (cserekártyát teszünk a helyére), feltornázhatjuk a különböző típusú nemesek számát, akár tízre is, ami 55 plusz pontot hoz. 
A játékosoknak gondosan kell tervezniük, hogy a kártyák kijátszását a lehető legkedvezőbben hajtsák végre. Persze a jó tervekhez egyrészt jó kártyáknak kell feljönniük másrészt az kell, hogy az  ellenfél ne vegye fel a számunkra nélkülözhetetlen kártyalapot. 


A játék kivitelezése számomra hagy kívánni valót maga után. Egy tábla, pár játékfigura, a többi kártyákból áll, tehát a kártyák grafikája döntő. Márpedig a kártyákon lévő grafikák – különösen a nemes kártyákon – elég gyengére sikeredett. Persze tudom, hogy ezzel azt a grafikai stílust utánozták, ami akkori korban volt, tehát a hangulatért bevállalták, hogy a grafika ne legyen annyira szép.A játék magával ragadó, mechanizmusa jól működik.

I've played the computer version of this game over 1000 times.  I never get tired of it.  Finally, I broke down and bought the game.  I love the fact that there is never enough money to do all the things I want to do.  It creates lots of tension.  This game is the ultimate game of money management.  Love it.  I think it plays better on the computer because there is so much transfer of money, that it more than triples the amount of time it takes to play the game in person.  I can play a full game on the computer in 10 or 15 minutes.  Traded the game away for that reason.  I just can't bring my self to play it anywhere but on the computer.

An enjoyable game, but hardly a very profound one. You simply buy things on each turn hoping to improve your position faster than other players at the table. It's important not to fall behind the worker/income growth curve in the first half of the game, which means that a player lucky enough to get an early Observatory is most likely on a fast path to victory. The more expensive buildings are a very specialised purchase as the bulk of the scoring comes from the end of game 'aristocrat' chart, but here again, you've got to be 'lucky' enough to obtain some identical nobles that you can upgrade to provide the necessary variety. In all a game that flatters to deceive, there's less going on here than first appears.

I'm a huge fan of what I call investment games and this is the prototypical example of such a game in my mind.  I love the investment-over-time aspect of it as well as the turn order manipulation.

Es un juego astuto que emplea los criterios elementales de la eficiencia económica: dicotomía entre gastar y conseguir puntos o invertir para conseguir con qué gastar. Fácil de aprender y fácil jugar bien a él. Adictivo. Gustará a jugones y a novatos, aunque no a quién se encuentre en los extremos de estos grupos.  Buena idea lo de "sin huecos en el tablero no habrá cartas nuevas" (deberás comprar -gastar- cartas que no te hagan falta para evitarlo). PEGAS: tiende a jugarse con piloto automático porque está basado en un algoritmo que se vuelve repetitivo (como San Juan o Dominion y no tiene sistema de variación de cartas como este último). Poca interacción. Sólo a veces te quitan/quitas la carta que tú/otros quieres/quieren.

Tacticaly deep game - need to play this more - then I will write more. Ok so I have played it more and I love it. Some friends hate how unforgiving it is and how boxed in you are based on what cards come out. I like games which challenge the player to get the most out of the resources available. It scales well for 2, 3 or 4 players but is a slightly different game with all 3 as time and oppertunity play a big part in what is a good buy.

The game is great with great choices. Unfortunately it's too much run away leader at 2 players. I think a system to help the player who produces less money could help... for example, if I could not buy a card because I'm the poorest, I could discard it - so the richest could not build it, becoming richer and richer.

As of late this is my favorite game.  My wife and I play this in the evening sometimes and we're still learning parts of the game.  The strategy is something that I have still yet to completely figure out as I'm still finding after I play something that I could have done something differently that would have been better.  The fact that this game is realitevly simple yet still enjoyable learning new strategies makes this a must play.  I have played this with a group of co-workers and they enjoy it as well, however being the board owner gives me a distinct unfair advantage.

Currently learning this game on www.yucata.de

My initial reaction is that there are 'conventional wisdoms' about what cards to buy, which cards to pass on (i.e., many moves appear 'scripted' depending on the cards that come up).  And if you don't get 'out of the box' well by establishing good income streams early in the game - it's impossible to catch up.

Seems to be the kind of game that I enjoy playing playing with 3 or 4, rather than as a 2-player.

(Based on first play) Slightly above average game. Despite its packaging with a large board in a decent size box, this is nothing more than a card game.  In my opinion, it would have been a much better production decision to lose the oversized board and box and spend the extra money for standard size cards instead of the small cards included in the game.  As for the game itself, it is mostly a min/max number crunching affair.  Not a bad game, but not my favorite.

Update: Well I have tried this some more and while my overall opinion hasn't changed I actually won't mind playing the occasional game of this. 

A fairly solid game beginning to end that seems to scale well with 3 player maybe the weakest due to 1 player going first twice. Still very dry really but strangely seems to grow on you for some reason, probably quick game time (especially computer version) and maybe always wanting to try to improve your score. Besides being non-interactive and dry it also lacks any kind of 'fun' factor and I could see how over time decisions will become too obvious. Still seems to have 'just' enough to keep you interested, I'm just not sure yet for how long...

I have played this exactly twice over-the-board, but I have played Guenther Rosenbaum's excellent computer version over 600 times.  While the game has flaws (the Judge and the MoC are undercosted, the observatory is too strong, the game is perhaps a bit too abstract), the mechanics are jaw-droppingly elegant.  The computer version is very addictive. I'm afraid I might become impatient playing St. Pete over-the-board after getting used to the instant response of the computer version.

I came to this game several years after it had been published. I've only had a few plays but like it - it's my kind of game; decisions without complexity and a good hint of tactical play.

If I lose, I always think "I know what to do next time.....", and wanting to play again after losing is always a sign of a great game to me.

Update NOV08 Introduced the game (at his request!) to my 9 1/2 year old boy. It's just a little long for him and his attention starts to wander if not checked towards the end, but he is a very capable player, beating me the first game he played and me beating him the second by 1 point!

Update APR11.Still playing the game, still coming last, often by some margin. Still enjoying the challenge, but dropped rating by a point.

Sadly it burns out after some 20 games for me. Those 20 games are very good but what spoils the fun the most is that once you fall back for a while, there is no way to recover. The leader will just extend the advantage - there is not much you can do.

Ok, I truly don't understand how I feel about this game. I've thought it was over-rated since I first tried it. However, I've downloaded the PC version which I play about a dozen times every week! Yet I still don't really love this game. So why am I so drawn to it?

After the second game I felt this game was a little dry.  If you fall behind..you really fall behind..and don't expect to come back because you won't be able to get the cards you need.

Attractive cards. Generally a quick pace with occasional bouts of over-thinking. I like the idea of the theme, but it's not conveyed here. More skillful with fewer players.

Played once with only two players. This was a good, challenging game. I felt pretty tense for the bulk of it and didn't think I was going to win until the very last round when I pulled ahead because I was able to buy more aristocrats than my opponent. I think as I play this more, it could go up to an 8.

RATING: 9
One of the games that got me truly addicted to the hobby, Saint Petersburg is an extremely fun engine-building game. I love figuring out the point at which an engine that makes money should start focusing on scoring, a point that changes depending on the number of players and the way the cards come out. It's also an amazing two-player game where both players must carefully consider when to remove cards from the board in order to maximize the opportunity of new cards for one's self (and minimizing that opportunity for the opponent).

It's definitely a game that will be a permanent fixture in my collection - the only question I have is whether or not to upgrade to the reprinted version that I haven't played yet.

Played once toward the end of a 15 hour gaming marathon. This particular play was enjoyable, and I got to meet three new people. However, it seemed like more of a pastime than a game. There wasn't much in the way of interesting or non-obvious decisions.

I like this game a lot, but I think the observatory card is unbalanced. If it comes out early the person that gets it has a big advantage. I knock a point off of my rating for that. In addition, some of the very high price aristocracy can be unbalancing if they come out on the first turn.

I played a second game with the new Banquet cards and I firmly don't like them. St. Petersburg is a very tight game with little room for missteps and these cards completely disrupt that flow.

I love Saint Petersburg and think of it as a light Euro. The cards are simple to understand, and because they are all out at once, you can easily explain them to new players. No need for people to puzzle out hands in secret. And I like that the money is money rather than spending other cards.

But there’s no catch-up mechanism, there’s no brakes on leaders. And the economics can be brutal – one game, my entire last round was passing to avoid taking the 5 point penalty for cards in my hand. And having to “pass” all the time is pretty annoying.

Building game set in Peter the Great's St. Petersburg. The game combines easy accessibility with quite a bit of depth (staying firmly in the "medium" bracket, though). The game works equally well with 2, 3, or 4 players but naturally feels more analytical with just 2 players. Very good game - and one which I highly recommend - as long as one remembers that this is *not* a heavyweight strategic game.

Ane conomic game about building cities with workers, buildings, and aristocrats.  The balance between gaining money and points, but that is similar to most games.  While I enjoy the game, there is no great desire to buy it.

RATING: 8
As long as no one is left behind in the first two rounds (it's easy to be tempted by a juicy building or aristocrat and then not have enough to buy a 3rd/4th worker in round #2 - provide fair warning when teaching new players), then this game is great fun.

I really like this little game. You have to be ultra-efficient with your game choices as you had SO LITTLE MONEY...  The length of the game is generally short (about 1h) and it has very simple mechanics (easy to teach) but offers surprisingly a lot of deep strategic options. Each move counts!!!

I have very fond memories of this game. This was one of the first boardgames I ever played, however nowadays I almost never want to play it so I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.5. This rating match better my feelings toward the game. Besides I´m currently revising all my ratings so they match the BGG rating system. 

Still I think Saint Petersburg is a good game, easy to teach, good components. With all certainty I will buy it again in the future.

This is the card game that San Juan is not.  For those who complain of the luck, I would argue that positioning the board in your favor is one of the crucial parts of the game.  Manage your luck with economy and your hand.

After playing this game many times... my rating has gone up.  Luck elements, which can be manipulated somewhat by transferring cards in and out of your hand, and careful observation of your turn in play order, can make for very tense finishes.  Because the quick play time ensures that players usually want to play again immediately to try new strategies, the game has a slightly 'addictive' quality.  Well deserving of all of its awards and accolades.

I don't normally like economic engine games. On one hand SP. is just 'buy workers to give you money to buy buildings to get you VPs; buy Aristocrats to score you points at the end.' But there is a whole card management thing here I didn't appreciate at first. It's all about creating tableau openings to ensure you get cards next round or screwing your neighbor. Managing the rhythm of the turn flow is the heart of the game, and that's very different than just building vp. The shifting tableau is clever, and was stolen by solo Gates of Loyang. 

Was: 7. Now 8 Liked better with more than 2 players. 5 with The Society expansion.

Played this again after a loooongg break and my initial score still holds. St. Petersburg plays easily and has moderately challenging decisions. I'm sure there's an optimum buying strategy (always buy this card, never that card), but I don't know what it is and don't want to know. The last round feels a little awkward as cards from already scored rounds gum up the board for new placements. Other than that, a perfectly enjoyable game.

RATING: 4
Two years or so ago I probably would have rated this game a 7 or possibly even an 8.  Played it quite a bit, found it relatively quick-playing and enjoyable.  Then the newness wore off, plus the very obvious problem of the Mistress on the flop -- player leading off the initial orange phase (assuming he/she held onto 18 rubles) had a huge, almost game-winning advantage.  I realize several fixes have been suggested, but you also have to deal with the judge on turn one and the mistress on turn 2 which are almost just as powerful as getting the mistress on turn one.  Right now, I rarely if ever play St. Pete, as I feel the game is seriously broken and there are much more inventive and creative games out there to occupy my interest.

2009 Update:  Have got in a couple of plays with the St. Pete expansion, which to some extent makes an effort to address some of the play balance concerns, mainly by:  (1) adding a really expensive green card; (2) upping the price of the Observatory from 6 to 8 and (3) adjusting the value but not the price of the Mistress.  However, the expansion doesn't adjust the price or value of the Judge, which is now the optimum first turn Orange buy (and almost as good as a first turn Mistress in the original game) but, what's worse, it introduces a new Blue card that allows you to "go fish" and get orange cards from those that have been upgraded, including cards just turned in by the player using the power.  In other words, for the same price as an Observatory, you get a card that is just about twice as good.  So, three steps forward, two steps back, meaning I have no great desire to play St. Pete at all these days.

2015 Update:   Still sticking by my "4" rating, but have played the newer 2d Edition expansion, which I feel improves the "scripted" play of the early turns by adding a fifth deck of cards (the yellow deck, tied to the market) and also a fifth player.  So, from now on, I expect all my St. Pete games will be with the newer version which I feel is far superior to the original.

Card game that I have yet to get the hang of, by about turn 3 everyone seems to have twice the income I have even though we bought very similar cards.

RATING: 7
Interesting mechanic of card drafting, but uninteresting game play due to fairly linear strategy.  There are some tactical nuances here but they are just too subtle and the game is just not compelling enough to dig down that far.  The accounting takes too much time for this kind of game, but its a good game for BSW, which does all of the accounting for you and 2-player games can take only 15 minutes.  And I really suck at this game ...
Update.  Played a few times recently and its really a pretty good game.  Don't know why I traded it now.

After a few plays I was in a love/hate phase with St.P - I liked it, but the luck of the card sequence seemed too heavy.  I've now played quite a lot more, mainly 2P on Yucata & I would rather play this online 2P, or at a push 3P, that any other game.  Sure, it sometimes goes sour with the card draw, but once you have played 10 or so times (maybe I'm just a slow learner) and get the flow of the turns and a reasonable knowledge of the cards this is a great game.  4P is too uncontrollable, so I avoid it 4P.

RATING: 5
In a way there's less to this than I thought there would be, but it also has a 'distilled essence' quality about it that's admirable. This is mostly cash flow and timing. It's is a nice change of pace from heavier fair and features crisp pacing in a 45 minute playing time. "Gamer's filler," if you will. There also seems to be a fair amount of luck in the cards that flip up. Players can manipulate who has a shot at drawing cards and how many shots they have, but significant advantages and disadvantages can come of which cards are revealed. It's enough to dampen the competitive feel (without wholly undermining it). The two-player game is drawn out, tedious, and much less strategic (I give it a 4/10). Four is best, three is workable. Unfortunately, the four-player game under-emphasizes buildings (blue cards) and over-emphasizes nobles (orange cards). 

Update: first play in months. Just a hollow shell of a game. Seems really obsolete in the face of Dominion, and I'd rather play a lot of games over Dominion.

I enjoy the tight economic challenge the game provides. However, after a few plays correct moves begin to emerge. There is very little room for creative play, the game plays out very much the same every time, and unfortunately the luck of the draw begins to dominate the outcome of the game.

It has been an up and down (or better: down and up) with this game so far. On my first play face to face I enjoyed it. With some more online play and hefty losses my motivation went down. Now that I'm higher on the "learning curve" the game starts to shine again. Too bad that most opponents in my game group will be in the down phase of enjoyment and are not likely to climb up with online plays.

Getting good at this game feels like work. The ones being good at it strongly advocate it. For others including myself it is too mechanical to really shine. I continue playing it online but I prefer other "learning curve games" like Hacienda.

I've played this a lot on yucata.de and a few times on BSW, and finally have played it live.  I find it a very challenging game (i.e., I lose a lot) with a lot of need for money management and a strategy towards winning.  I think its best with 3-4 players, and overall like it a lot.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite card games. I love creating a tableau of cards, with each item building off the others. The unique economy of the game makes it challenging, but I find the Noble scoring to be the dominant strategy and the game's only flaw.

Nice economic engine game with some possible card power issues. The observatory can be powerful if it's put out early and the Mistress is almost always too valuable to give up. I like it though and it comes out once a month as a quickish filler.

RATING: 9
It plays great with 2, 3 or 4.  As long as everyone plays quickly (which always happens with the people I play with), it maintains a great pace and is close right to the end!  It's very difficult to decide what formula to use to maximize your points, especially regarding the buildings.  

Update: Over time this game becomes more and more compelling, whereas for many people it seems to die out.  I have to say that I just really enjoy St. Petersburg!

A little torn about how to describe this game. On one hand, I can't stop thinking about it. On the other, I'm not quite sure what it is that I find so appealing about the game.

A cool game with good art. What else to say? This a really nice and, at least for me, somewhat unique game. You will always have to be creating possibilities for yourself for the future and creating a brighter future for yourself. That, in a way, nicely simulates the evolution of a city. Cons are the Mistress and the Czar Pepe himself, the first one too good a card and the latter utterly bad.

This game is quite average. Its fun until you figure out the appropriate strategies for each number of players and then it becomes pretty boring.

Loved this game first time I played it, which is one of the earlier euros I played. Not too long, interesting choices, fun engine-building, and it plays just as well with 2, 3, or 4 players.

RATING: 3
Economic snowball game reminiscent of Dominion. Gameplay consists of drafting cards and player interaction is restricted to taking a card so no one else can. There are two mostly separate curves, income and victory points, and your objective is to fit them together optimally within the constraints of random/limited card selection and game length. Time your slingshot better than anyone else at the table and you'll win. But is it fun? The computer version hasn't led me to think so, but then it doesn't exactly highlight the interaction aspect.

I must register a WTF about the special cards. Most of them just modify scoring. A few modify other rules, like the Warehouse and Czar Peter. Then there's the Pub which lets you take a special action to convert money into victory points: a little odd in context, but fits in well enough. Finally there's the Observatory, which allows you to tap it for a Magic-style library manipulation effect that sticks out like a surgically attached third arm. What is up with that? Did someone say at the last moment, "This game is way too dry, let's add [i]one[/i] card with a weird exploitable power"?

Each turn you either buy a card, reserve a card or pass. Simple actions that enable you to build a complex engine of cards that generate income and points.

This is an OK game but not interesting enough to make me want to suggest it. The board is quite irrelevant, this could be a card game. Upgrading buildings and aristocrats doesn't always make any sense. After an upgrade a firehouse can become a harbor and mistress of ceremonies can become a pope.

I played this for the first time a few days ago.  I enjoyed it, and would like to try it a few more times.  I was told by the players that had played a few games that Aristocrats were the key, and I ended up winning that game by building VPs.  So I am wondering if there isn't just one single strategy.

シンプルなルールだが、貴族や建物の種類をあらかじめ知っていないと勝てないゲーム。お金を銀行とやりとりするのが面倒でマイナス、また、カードゲームだが値段が高いのが難点。あきらかに強いカードがあるため、そのめぐりあわせも勝つためには必要かも。その意味で何回かの合計で競った方がいいのかも知れない。失敗が挽回できないゲームのような気がする。

Igazán kellemes csalódás. Egyszerű szabályrendszerű játék, de mégis van benne mélység, és bár nagyon alap dolgokat csinálunk végig, mégis bőven van döntési lehetőség, és kell egy kis idő, mire néhány dolog összeáll az ember fejében. A grafika olyan, amilyen, inkább szokatlannak mondanám, mint csúnyának, de azért megvan a maga bája. Tudom, hogy vannak hozzá kiegészítők, de valami miatt úgy érzem, hogy ehhez nem kell egyéb "turbózás", így tökéletesen játszható még társasjátékszűzekkel is.

At its best with two players, good with 3.  With four players you really need to add the expansion (which is a good idea anyway).

The typical Euro prides itself on having multiple paths to victory. This one really doesn't. There is pretty much only one path to victory; you can't neglect worker income or points from buildings or distinct aristocrats. You have to do everything, in just the right balance. And you will always be a dollar short.

Playing it well does feel a little like honing an algorithm in your head, and then practicing executing that algorithm as flawlessly as you can. That's not exactly a desirable quality in a game, I guess, but I find it to be a lot of fun, for a while. (Note: Dominion would feel just like this if you always used the same ten cards every time. St. Pete doesn't have a similar mechanism for varying the gameplay on each go.)

There's luck involved, but a lot more skill. There are many players on BSW who I just lose to time and time again.

RATING: 7
Very pretty game, liked the gold ink in the cards.

All in all a Max/Min game that runs fairly quickly, but seeming cold and mechnical.

Not much player screwage other than being able to take a card off the table they wanted.  So it's all a big race on the score track.

Each round is played in 4 phases, the Worker, Buildings, Aristocrats, and Trading phases.
Generally speaking, workers produce money, buildings produce victory points, and aristocrats produce either.  Cards in the trading stack come from each of these 3 categories, except that when you play a Trading card, you have to remove the same type card (Worker, Building, Aristocrat) from play. The trading phase also serves the purpose of cleaning off cards that haven't been played on the board.

The real trick to me it seemed was to build lots and lots of workers, get this huge revenue coming in, and start buying large Victory Point producing buildings.

Seems like a one trick strategy to me, which is why I can't really rate it too highly.  There's no way to destroy an opponent's resources.

Played it a few times now as a 4 player and we are both very impressed.  Easy to pick up but depth and thinking ahead required to make the most of your turn and decide on what to buy and play when. played it as a 2 player for the first time and its certainly different with each player getting to go first on the 2 of the 4 phases and then each round swapping over the phases on which you go first...means some thinking ahead and planning needed to make the most of the times you go first on certain phases...ie esp worker phase if not many worker cards are available.

Simple Play but with a lot of depth. You really get the feeling of becoming a powerful person too, with money making, building. 

Having played a bunch times, I now think that this game is kind of limited. Basically, the player that AVOIDS buying buildings and focuses soley on getting aristocrats will win. 

It doesn't sit well with me, that there's a red-herring in the form of the buildings, the buying of which will ensure your defeat.

I wish you had to balance spending on buildings vs characters more. It seems as though the only time I buy buildings is to make a space for me to buy characters the following round.

Prefer it for 2, so far. It can be pretty tense as your money ebbs and flows. I think the complaints that there is only 1 strategy are not correct, but it seems sometimes like the real strategy is to be lucky with the card draws. Update: There isn't much fun to it, and it's appeal is dwindling. I think it has been a victim of unfair expectations for us. It is awfully pretty, though. I wish there was more interaction not so much between players but between the phases- the intial description talked about hiring workers to build buildings to attract nobles, and nothing like that really goes on. It's some cards get you points and some get you money and some get you both, and none of it does any more than that.

Provisional rating. A simple card drafting economic snowball that gets some tension from the revolving turn order (if you start the first round, you start phase 2 of round 2 etc.) and the way next phase's cards come out (there might be not enough new ones for everyone unless someone buys one more before everyone passes in the phase before). There are some interesting decisions around that, but needs more play to decide if it's really good.

I'm sure that St. Petersburg currently benefits from the bloom of novelty, which may eventually wear thin.  Game emphasis changes drastically with different numbers of players.  Having all four players seems to make more differentiated strategies viable, but it's quite possible that variety will decrease with continuing play.

Variety has decreased, and my interest has waned.  Maybe I need to implement scoring and Mistress of Ceremonies changes, but I may not go through the trouble to do so.

The expansion has rebalanced the game pretty well, as well as changing some strategies.  I'm glad to see the game again.

I seemed to have an instant knack for this, winning the first several times we played. I'm surprised my family was willing to keep playing.  Eventually I lost but still win more often than not. I have recently played this several times as 2 player with my wife.  It plays pretty well and scores have been quite close.

When you get your friends together, do you REALLY want to play multi player solitaire? Because St. Petersburg is like a solitaire: no interactions, no sociability, just focus into your own game and at the end everyone looks who got the most points. Not very exciting. I guess this game works best in BSW?

An excellent game, but a super cutthroat competitive one masquerading a casual card game.  Someone who's played it a lot will always win against new players.  It's very easy to play, but hard to play well.  I haven't lost a physical game of this in a long time.  There's an excellent and free computer game implementation of this that it absolutely worth playing.

A really nice interactive card mgt. game about balancing money & VPs (victory points) and plays briskly.  SP is a card game as boardgame that uses "Buying" and "Hand Mgt". as the central game mechanic and it's slightly reminiscent to Princes of the Renaissance w/o the added complexities or length.  Essentially, it is a game about CASH FLOW.  You want income early on but eventually you want to rollover that into maximizing the most VPs at the best opportunities during alternating turn orders.  Timing is almost everything so prepare yourself for it.  With four sets of cards, and thus, four different 'First Player' markers, SP ideally is perfect with four plyrs but it plays very good with three.

This is an excellent game of resource management.  The decisions can be agonizing and wrong choices are very costly.  I feel that the power of the aristocrat deck unbalances the game slightly and tends to flatten the strategies in play among experienced players.

This game wasn't taught so well to me, so I was about halfway through playing it before I realized "Oh, this is just another version of San Juan, but with open drafting."  

Sadly, the open drafting doesn't make it any more interesting, and in fact probably less so.  You basically just optimize your own little board, maybe you get to take something your opponent also could have used, maybe not.  Maybe he gets the first crack at the thing you really needed.  Oh well.

I'd rather not ever play this again.  Lovely card art, though.

Saint Petersburg, a recreation of one of the glorious period in history.  Sometimes I really wanted to go back to those time as a noble, not a poor peasant of course.  The gameplay is a bit boring exercise of buying the right cards at the right time, with random cards shuffling tossing in for the different developemnt of the game. I am not sure I like this game a lot as it might have offered some strategy on its play.  Yet, it is not explicit in its execution.  I would think this is more a money game.

RATING: 7
Juego de cartas de gestión económica que tiene su intríngulis en saber elegir el mejor momento en el que usar una carta para obtener la máxima ventaja sobre tu rival.
Juego de mecánica sencilla apto tanto para novatos como para jugones,de fácil montaje y aprendizaje,de rápido e intuitivo desarrollo, de relativa interacción entre jugadores (no hay un puteo excesivo) pero de feo diseño que no obstante augura bastantes partidas. Aún así,parece que subyace una línea general de actuación que tiende a repetirse en todas las partidas:

1.No hay que pensar a corto plazo en términos de fases, sino a medio plazo en términos de rondas completas.
2.Sin artesanos no hay rublos, ergo... compra tantos como puedas y al menor coste posible, ya que todos los artesanos sea cual sea su coste reportan 3 rublos. Aún así,para asegurarte posibles mejoras es recomendable tener una representación de todos los tipos, más de los baratos y alguno de los más caros.
3.Los edificios reportan PV. Conforme aumentan su precio la relación coste/pv es más baja. Recomiendo comprar de los más caros y únicamente los baratos (2-3) cuando convenga (no al principio de la partida) para asegurarte una posible mejora posterior.Al principio de la partida ir detrás en el marcador no supone demasiado obstáculo.
4.Los nobles dan rublos y pv. A más nobles distintos más PV extra al final de la partida; si se repite de alguno que sea para mejorarlos con posterioridad.Al principio de la partida recomiendo comprar nobles de coste medio-alto y dejar los más baratos conforme avance la partida. Incluso sería recomendable en la primera ronda del juego no comprar ningún edificio y reservar el dinero para los nobles.
5.Las cartas de mejora son las mejores del juego. Es necesario amasar bastante dinero con el resto de cartas para poder comprarlas, de ahí el tener buenos nobles y muchos artesanos.
6.Guarda cartas que te interesen que no puedas o no quieras comprar por el momento (a veces es recomendable no comprar una carta aunque se tenga el dinero a la espera de la actuación del rival o a la espera de qué cartas salen en las siguientes fases de la misma ronda o hasta en una ronda posterior); si además evitas que tu rival la tenga, aún mejor. Aquí está el puteo del juego.
7.Importante sacar el máximo provecho de una fase en la que tienes el peón de primer jugador; ser el primero en actuar no tiene precio.
8.Sacar el máximo provecho de las cartas especiales: observatorio, pub, tax man, etc ya que suponen un plus interesante a tu economía y permiten una mayor variabilidad en las opciones estratégicas.
9. Valorar si te conviene dejar más o menos huecos para colocar nuevas cartas en el tablero; pocos huecos te interesa si vas ganando y muchos si vas detrás en el marcador. Coger cartas en tu mano es una forma de salir de una sitaución poco ventajosa con pocos huecos libres.
10. Todo lo anterior queda supeditado al orden aleatorio en el que aparecen las cartas en el tablero de juego;en algunas ocasiones saldrán cartas caras al principio que no podrán comprarse y provocarán cierto inmovilismo; si las cartas más económicas salen al principio de la partida, ésta será más ágil y rápida. Hay que saber sacar el máximo provecho de ambas situaciones: en la primera guardando esas cartas que de momento no puedes comprar y en la segunda comprando tantos artesanos como sea posible. 

Nota 1: Falta un poco más de put.. interacción entre jugadores.
Nota 2: No parece que la escasez de dinero sea un problema con demasiada incidencia en el juego, lo que le quita un poco de interés. 
Nota 3: A priori no parece un juego de finales ajustados como el también comprado este mismo año "Samurai" o el "Alta tensión", juego también de gestión económica; parece más bien que el jugador que mejor sepa aprovechar sus recursos puede abrir una distancia a mitad de partida que puede ser definitiva e irrecuperable, lo que claramente le quita emoción al juego.
Nota 4:Hay una estrategia a aplicar durante el juego que si no vencedora al menos si muy eficiente; este hecho le da al juego un punto de repetitividad que no me gusta. 
Nota 5:Es cierto que sólo hay una estrategia para vencer, pero como todos los jugadores la utilizan se producen partidas emocionantes y ajustadas donde un pequeño fallo puede salir muy caro. Además la interacción sube enteros al ser un aspecto más crucial todavía. Lo que antes parecía un defecto se convierte ahora en una loable virtud.

Fantastic for those who like non-confrontational card based games.  Some tough decisions to make, but once the game is understood it doesn't bog down much.  Tension is provided by an almost chronic lack of money in the early game, timing the mid-game transition of money to VPs, and the race for VPs in the end game.

[GAMEID=9217] was a game that had quite a few recommendations as a light-medium weight game, so we decided to give it a try.  The artwork was bright and colorful and evocative of the Russian time period.  And the paper money brought back memories of [GAMEID=1406].

However, the game just didn't click with us.  Despite having a lot of different cards, most were just variations on cost and income, and the game boiled down to a very straightforward economic engine game---buy green income cards until at some point you switch over to buy blue or orange victory point cards.  The key decision is when to make that crossover, but it just wasn't a very [i]fun[/i] decision for us.  It felt very mechanical.  One of the problems was that there really wasn't a difference between the cards.  Sure, some had different incomes and costs, but in the end there were no "special abilities" to keep us interested (with just a few cards like the [i]Observatory[/i] being an exception).  As a result, every game [i]felt[/i] the same, going down the same path (income then aristocrats) even if the cards were different.  It was a very dry, mathematical numbers game.

Still, I do like the [url=http://www.westpark-gamers.de/download/sp_pc_e.php]Westpark Gamer's computer version[/url] and have played that a lot.  It really distills the game down to just a few clicks (no need for shuffling, moving cards around the board, etc.), and makes for a decent computer solitaire game that you can play almost on auto-pilot to kill some time.

It's a decent game, not a favorite but a good allround game, to bad red cards have to much pull in the end... I'm raising and dropping the rating again every time i play because i just do not know how to rate this game so i settled on a 7... After playing this with the expansion several times. All the "bad broken cards" are replaced with better designed ones. This actually makes the game better. However, this should have come with the game and not be put in an expansion. the rating stands.

This is a fun game that people tend to enjoy, but I find that some choices tend to be too simple. Quite often the decision tends to obviously be "buy the cheapest worker," "buy the Mistress of Ceremonies," "upgrade to this excellent building," and so forth. 

A new player can also give a significant advantage (a la Puerto Rico) to the player to his or her left.

RATING: 7
Very nearly Ra's equal as a light (for my tastes) strategy game.  Rated half a point lower only because the luck is less manageable than in Ra, and the early gameplay is constrained by the need to ramp up your income.  Once you have a solid income established, however, there is a pleasant variety of strategies available to choose from, and tactical play is also quite rich for a game of its weight class.  Quite an addictive game, although it may be possible to burn out on it eventually.  Suitable as a gateway game, although it may be better as a 'next' game - the game you introduce to people as their second German-style strategy game after they have been introduced to them with something else.

UPDATE: I've lowered my rating by half a point because of the Mistress of Ceremonies 'bug', the (very slight) underpricing of the Observatory, and because of the constraints that the importance of endgame Aristocrat scoring place on a player's strategic choices.  I like the aesthetic of using a mathematical series (Triangular numbers) for this, but I think 'Tummelhofer' should have used one with a slower progression like the Tribonacci or Lucas series.

UPDATE: Finally got to play this FtF.  I was the administrator, and as a result got the full brunt of the fiddly bits effect of this game.  Surprisingly this didn't bother me as much as I thought it would, although banking definitely bugged me more than managing the cards in play.  This isn't so much a comment about SP being less fiddly in this respect than I expected, it certainly is extremely fiddly in terms of flying bits.  Instead it seems my tolerance for such things is higher than I thought it would be.  So my rating won't take a hit from it, but next game I am banker OR administrator, not both.

UPDATE: I've burned out on Saint Pete a bit, and rarely play it on BSW anymore, since I want to maintain some enthusiasm for playing it with my friends FtF, since they really enjoy it.  I've dropped my rating to 7.

UPDATE: Very much looking forward to buying the expansion, which should help straighten out most of the kinks in the base game. If it does what it promises, the expansion should rate an 8+

Played against a computer.

I don't like this game too much. The first few games are interesting but after a while it gets boring as a lot of your move need to be scripted if you want to win : always buy a resource, always buy aristocrat, do not buy a lot of building. It's especially flawed if someone gets the chance to buy a pricey a powerful aristocrat on the first turn. Add to that a cruel lack of interaction and you get a dry, boring game.

It's an engine-building euro where the stuff that builds the engine is really obtuse.
"All these green guys give me $3. Why do they cost different amounts?"
"Well, because of those icons. They might matter late in the game."
"What are the icons worth, then?"
"Well, if a particular upgrade shows up, you might be able to buy and swap it with a matching icon. If it shows up."
That sort of theme continues throughout the game, and it's unfortunately a far more coherent theme than the one the game wants to present.

A classic economic Euro game were you acquire Green cards that provide you with income.  Blue building cards that score victory points.  Orange noble cards that provide income and victory points at the end of the game.  It also include bonus cards which can be any of the other card types and usually upgrades the cards.  Plays very quickly even with 4 players and should not last more than an hour.  A good "next step" game as it is very light.  

You did need the expansion though as a few cards in the base game need to be replaced as they are overpowered.

I don't see why people like this game.  Everytime I play it, it feels like there are no meaningful choices to be made.  It's as if the game plays you, not the other way around.  There is almost always the "well duh" card to pick up when it's your turn.  Then it simply goes around the table.  Severe lack of different strategies, and when you do get to try a different strategy, it was because it was forced on to you by a lack of card choices.  If I had my way, I'd never play this game again.  Unfortunately, it gets brought out a lot at the gaming days at my local game shop. (have only played 4 player, I hear it's better with 2 or 3)

Saint Petersburg 聖彼得堡 
公元十一世紀，基輔衰落，並分裂成幾個獨立公國。蒙古於公元1238年入侵，焚燒莫斯科，破壞基輔。羅斯人被蒙古人建立的金帳汗國所統治。公元1380年莫斯科公國擊敗金帳汗國，擺離昔日臣屬關係，隱然成為各公國的首領。公元1462年伊凡三世Ivan III(伊凡大帝)登上莫斯科公國王公之位，致力開疆拓土，並自稱全羅斯大公，至此俄羅斯帝國略見雛形。 
公元1672年5月30日，彼得一世Peter I(彼得大帝)誕生。彼得執掌國家大權後即厲行改革，創建正規陸軍及艦隊。其後俄羅斯在長達21年的北方戰爭中，擊敗當時的北方強國瑞典，奪得了波羅的海的出海口及東南沿岸。在彼得大帝的領導下，俄羅斯由內陸國變成瀕海國，其後更成為歐洲軍事強國，奠下俄羅斯帝國的基礎。 
公元1703年，彼得大帝在奪自瑞典的土地上興建新城。這座以彼得大帝的守護天使聖徒彼得為名的城市，即聖彼得堡Saint Petersburg。聖彼得堡位於涅瓦河Neva與芬蘭灣Gulf of Finland 交會的河口，正如聖彼得執掌天國之匙，聖彼得堡成為了俄羅斯通往大海、面向歐洲的門戶。 
公元1712年初，彼得大帝正式遷都聖彼得堡，自此一直到公元1918年的二百多年，聖彼得堡一直是俄羅斯的首都。第一次世界大戰爆發後，俄羅斯在公元1914年去掉了首都名稱中的日耳曼語系色彩，將聖彼得堡更名為彼得格勒Petergrad。公元1917年在彼得格勒發生的二月革命和十月革命，推翻了長達304年的羅曼諾夫王朝。彼得格勒因太過接近邊界，為了更能背靠俄羅斯的工農業地區，蘇俄乃決定遷都回莫斯科。 
公元1924年1月，列寧Lenin逝世後，彼得格勒更名為列寧格勒Leningrad。及至公元1991年12月蘇聯解體後，這座城市才恢復了它的原名聖彼得堡。

替換牌trading card 30張(牌底印有綠、藍、橙三色。牌面分別是綠色、藍色及橙色為底色，各10張。牌底印有正方形圖案) 
起始玩家牌starting player card 4張(牌面分別印有椅子、正方形、人頭側影及俄羅斯屋頂圖案) 
起始玩家標記starting player marker 4個(漆上金色木製標記。分別是椅子、正方形、人頭側影及俄羅斯屋頂圖案) 
木製棋子8隻(紅、藍、黃、綠各2) 
遊戲圖板Game board 1塊(外圍印有計分表；上部為放置棄牌、勞工牌、建築牌、官吏牌及交易牌的牌疊位置；棄牌區下方是獎分表；下部分有兩行，各8個用作放置咭牌的置牌區) 

開局： 
將遊戲圖板展開放於桌上。 
將勞工牌、建築牌、官吏牌及替換牌分開。分別覆轉洗混後放到遊戲圖板適當的位置上。 
每位玩家獲發面值25盧布的紙鈔後，請將紙鈔收好。遊戲中玩家無需公開自己手持的金錢數目。 
剩下的紙鈔依面值分類，放到遊戲圖板旁作庫房bank備用。 
每位玩家獲發2隻同色的棋子。玩家需將其中1隻放到遊戲圖板左上角0分的位置上。另1隻則放在玩家面前的桌上，以標記該玩家的代表顏色。 
將起始玩家牌覆轉洗混，平均分發予每位玩家相同數目的起始玩家牌。 
若玩家數目只有3人，多出的1張起始玩家牌屬最年少的玩家所有。 
依據各玩家得到的起始玩家牌，玩家各自拿取配對的起始玩家標記。 
將所有起始玩家牌放回盒中棄用。 
由最年長的玩家主持遊戲。他將負責抽牌、點算金錢，及為每位玩家計算分數。 
依據玩家數目，遊戲主持拿起勞工牌疊，從頂翻開8張勞工牌(4人遊戲)，從左到右逐一放到遊戲圖板的上行咭牌位置。3人遊戲翻開6張；2人遊戲翻開4張。 
遊戲主持放回牌疊時，需將牌疊直放，以標示遊戲每回合的進度。一般情況下牌疊皆為橫放。 

遊玩： 
這遊戲以回合進行。每回合包含4個階段。完成4個階段後，回合結束。遊戲將從新開始另一回合。直至遊戲結束。 

每回合的流程： 
勞工階段；起始玩家標記是椅子圖案。 
建築階段；起始玩家標記是俄羅斯屋頂圖案。 
官吏階段；起始玩家標記是人頭側影圖案。 
替換階段；起始玩家標記是正方形圖案。 
若遊戲尚未結束，各玩家將持有的起始玩家標記交予其左方的玩家。 

勞工階段、建築階段及官吏階段，每個階段皆以下列步驟組成： 
1. 玩家行動 
2. 收取回報 
3. 補充咭牌 
替換階段則沒有收取回報這個步驟。因此遊戲圖板替換牌牌疊的位置上，並沒有印上金錢和分數圖案。 

1. 玩家行動 
由持有這階段之起始玩家標記的玩家開始，依順時針次序，每位玩家輪流執行1個行動。 
放棄執行行動的玩家，在稍後再輪至他時，仍可重新選擇是否執行行動。 
例：玩家依順時針方向的次序為甲、乙、丙、丁。玩家甲、乙依次序完成一項行動後，丙棄權。丁完成行動後，甲、乙棄權。丙現在可重新考慮是否執行行動。 
一旦所有玩家都連續放棄執行行動，玩家行動步驟立即完結。這條件與誰是起始玩家無關。 
例：最後執行行動的玩家是乙。玩家丙、丁及甲棄權。一旦乙選棄權，則行動步驟結束。 
當輪至玩家執行行動時，玩家可選執行以下4項的其中之一： 
買牌buy：將遊戲圖板上翻開的咭牌，放到玩家的桌前。 
取牌add：將遊戲圖板上翻開的咭牌，放到玩家的手牌之中。 
打牌play：將手牌中的咭牌，放到玩家的桌前。 
棄權pass：放棄執行行動。 

買牌 
玩家從遊戲圖板上，放在置牌區內的咭牌中，選出1張咭牌(任何種類皆可)放到自己的桌前。 
計算該咭牌的價格後，玩家需即時支付金錢予庫房。 
放到玩家桌前的咭牌，即可以在往後的收取回報步驟中，為玩家帶來回報。 

取牌 
玩家從遊戲圖板上，放在置牌區內的咭牌中，選出1張咭牌(任何種類皆可)加到自己的手牌中。 
玩家的手牌最多只可有3張咭牌。手牌中的咭牌並無任何效用。 

打牌 
玩家從手牌中，選出1張咭牌(任何種類皆可)放到自己的桌前。 
計算該咭牌的價格後，玩家需即時支付金錢予庫房。 
放到玩家桌前的咭牌，即可以在往後的收取回報步驟中，為玩家帶來回報。 

棄權 
玩家放棄執行任何行動。 
若玩家行動步驟尚未完結，則輪至其左方玩家執行行動。 

2. 收取回報 
檢視各玩家的桌前，根據各人擁有的咭牌，分別計算各人的回報。 
玩家桌前的咭牌先依牌面顏色分成3類，會較方便計算回報。 
不同階段中，各玩家依不同種類的咭牌，計算這些咭牌中錢幣及盾牌印明之數字的總和。玩家可以收到等同該數字的金錢及分數。 
一般來說勞工牌會為玩家帶來金錢；建築牌則為玩家帶來分數；官吏牌及替換牌則可能為玩家帶來金錢及分數。 

回報： 
勞工階段中，各玩家點算自己桌前牌面是綠色底色的咭牌(即勞工牌或替換牌)。依綠色咭牌中錢幣及盾牌印明的數字，玩家可以收到該數字的金錢及分數。 
建築階段中，各玩家點算自己桌前牌面是藍色底色的咭牌(即建築牌或替換牌)。依藍色咭牌中錢幣及盾牌印明的數字，玩家可以收到該數字的金錢及分數。 
官吏階段中，各玩家點算自己桌前牌面是橙色底色的咭牌(即官吏牌或替換牌)。依橙色咭牌中錢幣及盾牌印明的數字，玩家可以收到該數字的金錢及分數。 
替換階段並不包含收取回報這步驟。 

3. 補充咭牌 
遊戲圖板下部分有兩行，分別8個用作放置咭牌的位置，構成2行8列的置牌區。 
每列置牌區都只可放置1張咭牌，即遊戲圖板上最多只可放有8張咭牌。 
遊戲主持將遊戲圖板上，先將下行置牌區的咭牌全數靠右排列。這步驟在第一回合並不會出現。替換階段中無需理會此項。 
遊戲主持將遊戲圖板上，先將上行置牌區的咭牌盡量靠右排列。因為每列置牌區都只可放置1張咭牌，若下行置牌區放有咭牌，則上行的咭牌只好排在最右的空列。 
依直放牌疊的種類，遊戲主持拿起下一個橫放牌疊，翻開足夠的咭牌。將咭牌放到置牌區，讓遊戲圖板上補足8張咭牌。 
例：下行置牌區只剩1張咭牌，上行則剩2張咭牌。遊戲主持先將下行的1張咭牌放到下行最右一列。上行的2張咭牌則只可移至上行最右的第二及第三列。遊戲主持需翻開5張咭牌，放到上行最在的5列中。 
若遊戲圖板上經已有8張咭牌，則遊戲主持無需翻開新的咭牌。 
若牌疊沒有足夠的咭牌，在遊戲圖板上少於8張咭牌的情況下繼續遊戲。 
早前直放牌疊恢復橫放，遊戲主持放下牌疊時則需直放，以表示遊戲進入另一階段。 
勞工階段時，遊戲主持需以建築牌補足8張咭牌；建築階段時，遊戲主持需以官吏牌補足8張咭牌；官吏階段時，遊戲主持需以替換牌補足8張咭牌。 
替換階段時，下行置牌區的咭牌全數棄用，變作棄牌。原先在上行置牌區的咭牌，則全數移到下行。遊戲主持需以勞工牌補足8張咭牌。 

咭牌的價格： 
每張咭牌的左上角皆印有一個數字。該數字即是這咭牌的基本價格。 
買牌或打牌時，依據玩家桌前的咭牌，玩家每擁有一張同樣的咭牌，則可獲減1盧布的折扣。 
買牌時，若該咭牌是放在下行置牌區的咭牌，則可獲減1盧布的折扣。 
買牌或打牌時，若玩家桌前放有木工場Carpenter workshop，而該咭牌的牌面是藍色底色的話，則可獲減1盧布的折扣。 
買牌或打牌時，若玩家桌前放有煉金場Gold smelter，而該咭牌的牌面是橙色底色的話，則可獲減1盧布的折扣。 
以上折扣皆可累積。只要條件合適，這些折扣同時有效。 
縱使折扣大於咭牌的基本價格，所有咭牌的最低價格仍是1盧布。 
例：玩家甲決定買下放在下行置牌區中的伐木工Lumberjack。玩家甲檢視放在自己桌前的咭牌，他經已擁有2張伐木工，故此他可獲合共3盧布的折扣。伐木工的基本價格是3盧布，所以玩家甲仍要支付1盧布。。 

替換牌的使用： 
若玩家是以替換牌作買牌或打牌時，玩家必須在自己桌前的咭牌中，棄掉另1張咭牌。 
遭棄掉的咭牌，必須與剛打出的替換牌種類相同(即牌面的底色相同)。即以藍色的換掉藍色的建築牌，橙色的換掉橙色的官吏牌。 
使用綠色的替換牌則多了一項限制。每張綠色咭牌的右上方有一個圖案(木板、毛皮、船隻、布匹及金塊)，被換掉的勞工牌必需印有與替換牌相同的圖案。 
玩家不可棄掉替換牌，以換上另一張替換牌。 

替換牌的價值： 
每張替換牌的左上角皆印有其基本價格。 
只要條件合適，一般咭牌之折扣同樣適用於替換牌。 
將替換牌加上折扣後的價格，與被換掉的咭牌之基本價格比較。若替換牌的價格較高時，玩家需支付其差額予庫房。 
縱使兩者差額等於或少於0，玩家最少仍要支付1盧布。 

終局： 
當補充咭牌時，若某牌疊的所有咭牌皆已耗用(即放置牌疊的位置上完全沒有咭牌)，則這回合即成為最後一個回合。這回合結束後遊戲立時完結。 

勝負： 
計算各玩家桌前之橙色咭牌的種類數目，擁有越多不同的官吏，玩家獎分越多。 
第一種官職1分；第二種官職2分；第三種官職3分；第四種官職4分；如此類推。這項獎分只累進至10種官職，多於10種的官職將不會增加分數。 
例：依獎分表，擁有11名官吏合共10種官職可讓玩家多得55分(1+2+3……+10)。 
計算各玩家擁有的金錢，每10盧布可得1分。 
檢查各玩家的手牌數目。每擁有1張咭牌，玩家將被扣去5分。 
擁有分數最多的玩家獲勝。 
分數相同則以金錢多寡分勝負。金錢多者獲勝。

玩家可將新得到的咭牌，如常支付代價後放到自己的桌前；或將這咭牌加進手牌之中；或將這咭牌放到棄牌中。 
這行動每回合只可執行一次，並將取代玩家的正常行動。

9/2005: Another card game with a board.  And again, card knowledge and availability greatly affects the outcome of the game.  There's little to no player interaction.

5/2009: Had a bad feeling about playing this again from the outset.  It's still a covered up card game with the earlier mentioned flaws.  Also, there's a big run-away-leader issue.  Rating down 4 -> 3.

Pretty good game that looks like it should be very very easy, but it's not. Rules are easy to learn, figuring out what to do to not get slaughtered is the fun aspect of the game. In a game of experienced players it's transformed into an optimization game, but it can take many plays before you reach that state.

Hard decisions and money management. Definitely loses its charm the more it gets played. Where you sit in the turn order has such an impact on what you can do. It's easy to get shut out of the things you need early on and not be able to catch up. That said, it's still a challenge for me to play better.

RATING: 8
This is a fairly light economic engine game, but with sufficient depth and strategy to be satisfying. This works well as a 2-player game, which means it gets a lot more play in our house since my wife and I can play it on a weeknight. The first time I saw the artwork, I thought it looked crap, but it grows on you and after a while it really starts to appeal - a bit like the work of Klemenz Franz. This will really appeal to players who want an economic game that can be played in under an hour.

Nice short game, however the Observatory is broken, especially if it turns up early in the game. You should either remove them or shuffle them in the lower third of the stack. Furthermore I believe there is a little bit too much luck in which nobles are drawn i.e. which ones you get. They do yield a lot of points in the end and the difference between having one more or less is a bit unbalancing. Both problems could be fixed, making my rating go up to a 6.

Update: After a number of plays the game doesn't feel very interesting anymore to me.

RATING: 9
[Played more than 100 times] 
Simple mechanics, but they work very well. A streamlined "economic engine" game. Addictive.
With 2 players you have more control and the game is more strategic; additional players make the luck of the draw heavier. 
Note: a first turn Mistress or Judge is often too powerful and can easily ruin the game, but either you accept the challenge (to defy it when it happens to the opponent) or quickly fix the problem with a house rule (reduce their income to only 4$ or reshuffle them if revealed in the first turn).

Well, there are many hand building, card upgrading games out there.  Not my particular interest, and some cards are clearly better than others.  Once you figure out what cards are best, the strategy becomes a bit dull.  Dominion is much better.

[2-4] A nice card game with a good balance if you tweak the final aristocrat scoring. Always short on money. A bit of solitaire feeling with 2 players but it doesn't matter at all.

RATING: 7.5
Gets better each time I play.  I thought at first the game was scripted- one way to play and win.  While I still feel there are some "must do" elements to the game, how you go about it still makes for lots of hard decisions, and solid enjoyment playing. I also feel aristocrats are pretty important, but you don't need the most to win.  You just need to keep close.  I find buildings can really make a big difference, especially early on in the game to help you get more points throughout the game.

RATING: 5
Once I reached the 10 play mark, I realized that the game is scripted. Basically, the winning strategy is to buy as many greens for income as you can, picking up an aristocrat here and there. Then, half way through the game, switch over to major aristocrat buying. Going blue never wins with experienced players.

I put off buying this because my first play was with someone who didn't know how to teach the game. I purchased it later and was determined to get it to the table and play before I lost interest. I decided to play a practice round, and taught how the cards worked as we went along. The group loved the game and requested a second play. That doesn't happen often on our first play. We've gotten a lot of play out of this game.

Wow always a great game. Always advise new players not to spend all there money at once at the start on an expensive building as they will struggle to recover. 

I have the old Czech version with the nice artwork and have no interest in picking up the new version with the additional market and expanded 5 player count. Artwork counts a lot towards my enjoyment of a game and the new version, for me, is awful. Haven't played the expansion for the original game so can't comment on that but would love to get it.

Just a great game. Probably my favourite game with paper money (can't think of a better one right now, and why did I even think of that category??).

UPDATE

I hadn't played this one for a while and this game made me think about it slightly differently. I will say this was an older Czech version of the game without the additional market and 5 player rules. 

This game has always been in my personal top ten since I first played it. I have always thought of it as a kind of gateway game as long as you explained the need to generate a money engine and not overspend at the beginning on any one card. Go for a bit of everything and then start focusing on collecting the aristocrats.

Well I had the feeling it wasn't a great experience for one of the players, and they were very eloquent as to the reasons why and it did make me think about the game. It is true that the game has absolutely no catch-up mechanism and I guess in this way it is showing its age if you are used to games giving a more even experience. It's true if you over spend or mis-manage spending you are very unlikely to catch up as there is no in-built mechanism to aid this. Also once you fall behind on the financial benefits of courting the craftsmen you are also going to be hard pressed to catch up in this respect of generating income.

The comments were spot on and I can completely see the validity of them, it just made me think about the different experiences gamers can expect in modern game design. Saint Petersburg came out in 2004, and I guess for some people now, it is showing its age ... But for me even if I had to reduce my collection to just 10 games I suspect it would still be there on my shelf, as its overall experience, game play and decision making is unique and I really enjoy it.

RATING: 3
System is innovative... it could have been a good game.

But there is one big problem - that is, just one optimal strategy is available. "Buy workers, and buy nobles." Now the game becomes a boring repetitive process, with winning only depending on luck of draw. Interaction is scarce, theme is pasted on... No charm.

RATING: 5
Light "economic" card game. Not great but not bad either. Definitely play without the expansion and with an even number of players.

For some reason it reminds me of "Ascension", or should I say "Ascension" reminds me of "St. Petersburg" since this one is antecedent and slightly better.

Upgraded to a 9.  My wife and I still enjoy this one.  A fun, couple game that doesn't require too much strategy.  Timing what you are concentrating in phases of the game is important - buildings are very important to winning but only if you make sure to keep up with Nobles.  The Nobles also pay so getting them early is important instead of buildings as one strategy.  The strategy of getting an expensive building early because its points will add up over time does not seem to work - too expensive too early.  The game's artistic design is superb. 
For those who think Nobles are the true path to success, I just won the game where I had only 7 nobles and my wife had 10 (giving her a 27 point difference at the end) but it wasn't enough for her to win.  Buying cheaper buildings at the beginning and upgrading them along with point-laden Nobles can give you a tremendous point lead.  So there's another winning strategy.

RATING: 8.5
Very good card game (with a board). I have only played two player games, so my rating is for 2player. This game is very tense, especially in the beginning and in the very end. 

You don´t have room for mistakes in the beginning. I like the way one can control the decks, opening space for cards to enter in the next turn, or bleeding one deack to sped the game end. This is my second most played game, right after Carcassonne (for now). 

The new society expansion is great and makes the game more balanced. The Banquet expansion is TERRIBLE and totally ruins the game, avoid it at any cost. Some may say the artwork is ugly. I can understand it, but I like it anyway.

Excelente juego de cartas, con estrategia relativamente simple y, por lo mismo, de bastante rápido desarrollo. Ideal para dos jugadores.UPDATE: de 9 lo bajo a 6.7 porque se ha vuelto bastante mecánico y la estrategia parece casi única: comprar pocos edificios y cargar la mano con los aristócratas y las cartas de intercambio. Sacar el observatorio y cambiarlo al inicio por verdes y cerca del final por naranjas; comprar el pub para el final.1 JULIO 2005: de solo pensar en jugar, aburre. Estrategia bastante obvia...quedando todo a la suerte.Enero 2007: es un juego fluido, rápido, que es perfecto cuando no se desea mucha concentración. Para esas ocasiones es ideal. Lo subo a 7.1

A great medium light game.  Difficult decisions on how to balance money against gaining victory points, while ensuring your opponents don't run away with the game.  The randomness of the draws ensure that tactics have to be developed on the move and the way turns rotate means that each play get their share of advantages and disadvantages: and this probably is the weakness of the game - sometimes one player will simply get lots of good luck compared to other players which can skew the balance of the game.  But generally a fun game to play.

RATING: 7
This is a brilliantly executed game. The rules are fairly simple, but the interactions are subtle and interesting. We spent our first game thinking I was hosed, then that someone else was hosed, and then wound up within 10 points of each other -- and had two of us not made bad plays in the final round, we'd have been two points apart. Unlike some games, that tightness didn't feel forced or artificial.

The rhythm of the game -- filling slots with available cards, who goes first in each round, buying vs. taking and playing, how cards get scored -- is unique, tense at times (and very enjoyably so), and leads a great mix of strategy and tactics. Its brilliance is understated in its expression, but it's there.

It's pretty too. I especially like the subtle gold details in the cards and the period feel of the artwork. I do wish the insert worked a bit better (when stored sideways, all the cards get mixed up), but that's a minor complaint. I even get why this game uses paper money, which I generally loathe: You look at your money a lot, and it needs to be secret; there's not really a better way to meet those criteria than paper money.

St. Pete is a gem.

Purchased new Sept 18, 2008

Played completely wrong the first time. We were shifting cards from the first to the second row and cards in the second row to the discard pile every phase rather than every round.  Makes for a very weird experience.

The second time was better but the end game seems pretty anticlimactic.  Playing through the last trader phase seems like it would only make a difference if you can upgrade some of your duplicate orange/red cards. Does that happen much?

The jury is still out and I need to play with more than just two.

**Update.  I have to downgrade this just a bit.  I think it's a good game and I enjoy it.  The game gets high marks for being quite pretty but I can't get over the clunkiness of the money exchange.  Also, I've gotten quite good at this now and find little need or ability for variation of play in order to win.

Would be keen to play again.  May rate higher with future plays.

[i]Saint Petersburg[/i] is a very dry game (ooh, my favorite) that is all about being able to anticipate future income while setting your future expenses appropriately (by taking appropriately priced cards into your hand).

I have done well so far by following a strategy of being constantly almost-but-not-quite-broke.  I try to have just enough money to play a card in the current phase while taking cards into hand that I will be able to play in the next phase or two.  What cards I take depends on the payments I will receive at the end of the current/next phase.  Occasionally, I have taken duplicate orange cards just to block an opponent who is trying to steamroll the end-game set collection bonus, especially if they aren't too expensive.

Astonishingly simple, but thoroughly enjoyable tight economic balancing game, which looks pretty shallow at first, but because certain little nuances it make quite replayable and more fun with every play.

2-player. Nice "busy-body" game (always something to do). Have a slight concern that the scores in the two games I played were very close and thus the game was decided  by a lucky/unlucky last draw. Need to play more to see if this pattern hold up (or if I can find a new strategy).
EDIT: upped rating. "Lucky" last draw can be mitagated by careful play. Though interaction is indirect, there's a lot to think about it terms of how many cards to take in order to control the flow of cards (at least in 2-player). A real "you outsmarted me" feeling to this game. Oh yeah, wife likes it a lot too -- another plus!

Quite a nice game. You have to react to the cards drawn and adjust your strategy ascoordingly but there is a basic flow to the game. You need to establish income to be able to purchase point earners and grow your income. The aristocrats are an important part of the game and can add to the luck factor of the game BUT the game plays quick enough and for me has a light enough feel that random nature of the card draw doesn't bother me.

The replacement cards from the expansion adjust things in the game enough to feel more balanced now. We do only play with the new + replacement cards and not special actions etc.

  Gosh, I really tried to like this game.  Maybe it's the theme, maybe it's the art, mostly I think it's basically the lack of fun.  No player interaction except for taking the card the next guy wanted.  Fiddly and cumbersome.  It's not an elegant game design.   Another try with a different group and it's better.  You have to know the cards to have it really make sense, so repeated plays will probably improve the score, but it still isn't a game I would choose.

Played as: 2,3 player live; 2,3,4 player on Yucata.de

Played with: New Society Expansion (2,4 player on Yucata.de)

Pros: Smooth flowing mechanics with an un-assuming tactical heart. I specifically enjoy how different cards are scored at different times. It creates this inner struggle of what I want now vs. what's going to be good for me later; especially in the early rounds when moneys very tight. Gives you a nice shot of uncluttered euro in under an hour.  

Cons: Very straight forward strategically. Requires players of relatively equal skill to be competitive. Minimal interaction. Has a run-away leader problem where the game's outcome can probably be told with 85% accuracy after the first 2-3 rounds (especially in two-player games). Finally, I don't necessarily mind it, but it's pretty clearly a math game.

Other: It took me one game to understand that it's pretty straight-forward strategically and must gain any lasting power from subtle tactical play. Even at that, if you really dig in, I don't think the tactical decisions are that advanced after a dozen or so plays on average. For me, the game peaked somewhere between 5-10 plays. There seems to be more life in the game with three or four players while I'll likely avoid two-player gamers because of the way it seems to amplify the game's problems exponentially.

Best Use: Quick hitting, medium-light euro when you need a fix.

Nice, quick card game that plays fast. Enjoyed my first 4 games quite a bit. Perhaps not a game that will come out all the time, but it is enjoyed by our "lighter" gaming group. Only drawback for me is the tiny cards - especially for a card-based game. Luck factor is there, but a good player can overcome most bad draws with prudent play.

Played a dozen or so games so far (4 player and 3 player). Don't quite know why I like it so much. Nothing terribly new, but what it does, it does very nicely.

Well, pretty decent game, but another where the theme has nothing to do with the game.  Nothing really struck me as 'new' about the game, and a lot of wasted space in the box: the board, markers were all supurfluous.  Had fun, but it would wear quickly.  Probably off my 'buy' list, but on my 'will play other's copies' list.

RATING: 7
A bit tough, but good game of resource management.  Use economic builds to get more economic power, to feed into getting builds that victory points without falling behind economically.  And all the while, try to manipulate the board to make sure there are enough builds available for you (using your builds and the ability to put cards into your hand for later building) and try to collect nobles (which are mediocre money and mediocre victory points) for a big one-time payout in the endgame.I've dropped my rating a bit over time -- with repeated play, the game seems to have more randomless and less skill, and be a bit less satifying.  But the game's still a keeper.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fairly tight economics, interesting drafting mechanism. I like how the number of cards purchased in earlier round influence the number of cards available in later rounds in different categories. The "noble" strategy seems much more powerful than any other; buildings should've been costed a little less (or the end-of-game bonus dropped a little). A fine game, but could get repetitive over time.

A lot of fun can be hard to gauge when to switch from buying workers for the money to buildings for the points. Well thought out.

RATING: 7
Solid midweight Euro.  Very proactive about managing income versus overall victory points.  Once understood, the turn progression is really simple and intuitive.  A couple paths (buildings and aristocrats) seem to be presented for first few plays, allowing one to choose and explore different methods of playing.

RATING: 7.5
A nice surprise for me. Lots of interesting decisions, a not too long play time (if the players are smart), good mechanics... Need to play more to check the replayability of it - seems that the game can be somewhat "solved". Until them, it seems to be a nice card game, a little bit overproduced. UPDATE (after several BSW plays): lowering to 7.5, because there arent many real hard decisions to make, there is only one or two real paths to victory. Blue and green cards always run out before the others.

nothing really new, but it is fast and entertaining.

*************

expansion cleans up the base game a little bit.  nice mix-and-match.  the tweaked observatories and mistress of ceremonies are potentially a must use.  

almost underrated now.  just beyond length of a filler, but has some good aspects and is entertaining.

Poker chips are a must as the money is ridiculous.

*************

even without the expansion, still probably best to incorporate the '8' cost observatory and the revised mistress of ceremonies.

I definitely want to play this again; now that I've played f2f maybe I'll go back to yucata and get some more games. There isn't a ton of depth, but it's quick enough that that doesn't matter too much. I'd rather play a game with more long-term planning, but when that's not an option, St. Pete is going to provide interesting choices.

Don't play this with people who are on different skill/experience levels. Buy it for a group of new players, play the heck out of it until you fully understand it. Then move on. It's a great experience while "leveling up" but a bit too samey once you "get it".

Update: Triggered by the upcoming new version (incomplete and with new rules...) I decided to read up on what should exactly be in the decks. Now set up to play as intended. Before we had removed even the nerfed version of the observatory and the tower.

RATING: 9
Too long and strategic to be a super filler but quick playing, this game is a new favorite. Turns are so short you're never disengaged. Card availability variance forces varying strategies. This is the distillation of an economic engine game to its most basic parts. Players are forced to balance money and point earning power, but as (most) every card scores every round, there is no pinpointed pivot, rather a huge gray area across the widest expanse of the midgame. Easy to pick up but with lots of room for strategic growth and always a fun time.

RATING: 7
I basically fell in love with the simplicity of the game from the get go. Some luck involved in what cards comes on the table when you are in (or out of) position, but other than that only dependent on your and the other players actions.

Have since gone down to a 7. Always seem to be a better game available.

Worker rush is the best way to win.

RATING: 5
I thought I would like this game, because it was compared to San Juan, but I don't. There are a lot of no-brainer decisions on buying cards, such as until the last few rounds, you should always buy any worker card you can get your hands on, starting with the cheapest. They will all pay for themselves in 1 to 3 rounds. A silly tactic then seems to be to manipulate the number of workers that will be available, so that if you're first in the round, the number of workers mod the number of players is 1, and you get one more worker than the other players. This extends to other categories of card, though not as much.

There is marginal difference between value per cost of different cards, and not much you can do in combination to improve upon that. I've heard the trick is that every investment is profitable, but if you make every investment you won't have the cash on hand to make the best investment when it becomes available. I don't really grasp how to recognize the best investment. Maybe if I did, I'd appreciate this game more.

For 2 player I would rate it nearly a 10. One of the best 2 person strategy games. It just don´t get the top spot because of the problem with the "18 noble" in the first round. With more players it gets too chaotic, for 3 players I would rate it a 7 and with 4 players I give it a 6.

RATING: 7
It's like an 'empire building' game, but there's not fighting. Still, there is 'subtle' interaction (denying certain cards to other players, etc.). Like stated before, there are optimal moves, so if you play with people who like to calculate, the game will drag.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tight and nicely done.  I've burned a lot of time playing against the AI but much more satisfying face to face.  One bad decision can be hard to recover from and I can easily see why this game divides people.  Be sure to fix the card values they adjusted by either getting the expansion or fixing them yourself.

Pros:
Fast playing for how tough it is
Scales well across the board
Interesting mechanisms/game flow
The fun of trying to nail when to switch from $ to vp
wife friendly

Cons:
Paper money
Dry
No interaction
Unforgiving (runaway leader possibilities)

Fun game that's Puerto Rico Lite.  I enjoy the strategic calculations, but I find it's a game that's hard to claw back in if you get behind--not so balanced.  I haven't found them yet, but I rather suspect there are degenerate strategies to exploit (I just haven't played enough to find them).

One of the best ever. This is an optimalisation game in it core. I like the tension between increasing your income or investing in victory points. It is simple, but the more you play it the more strategy is revealed. The cards come out differently every game which keeps it fresh. I love this game and will keep playing it for a long time.

RATING: 8
A resource management game much in the vein of Puerto Rico. Players compete for currency and victory points py playing/buying cards from a line. Feels like a slightly lighter version of Puerto Rico. The fact that there's always never enough resources to do all that you wish, multiple paths to victory and crucial decisions make for an excellent game!

Esetleg még ezekkel kiegészíteném:
 - 4 fázis / 4 féle akcióval = rendkívül egyszerű játékszabály
 - folyamatosan fenntartja a feszkót, akár azért, mert éppen le vagyunk égve anyagilag, akár azért, mert éppen tele vagyunk és feszülten számolgatunk, hogy milyen lappal járunk a legjobban = aki szereti a gondolkodós kártyajátékokat, ennek nagyon fog örülni
 - hasonlóan egy LCG-hez (mint pl. a Dominion), itt is egy pénz- és ponttermelő motort kell felépítenünk, annyival megbonyolítva az életünket, hogy a nemesekre duplán figyelnünk kell, ők ugyanis nagyon sokat érhetnek a végén

Saint Petersburg is a euro classic.  It is one of the best "money early points later" games I have played.  The game is very balanced outside of early observatories (which was addressed in the expansion).  I like the game with any number of players, but it seems best with 2.

After giving this another chance a few months back I have come to really appreciate it a lot more and have been playing online and picked up my own copy.  Generally, a quick game (although I did play an excruciatingly long game with 5 players and the New Society expansion), but it has some meaty decisions.  I think it's best with 3.

There's a lot that I like about this one, but it had a runaway leader issue for us with two players.  Twice, we stopped about a third of the way through because it was obvious that the trailing player had no hope or no chance.

Maybe we were missing something.  I'm thinking that it either requires experienced players who won't make the mistakes that we did, or it works better with more than two.  However, after reading several other people's comments next to their low ratings, I think we probably didn't miss anything and my rating on this one is more likely to go way down than way up.

I might rate it better if I weren't so terribly awful at it.  Something about it just seams too abstract to me.  To me the theme is just so lightly pasted on that I never can get into the game.  The strategy is good, but I either want more strategy with my abstract strategy or more theme with my lighter game.

I was taught this at UK BayCon 2006 by an expert player (and very nice guy) Mr. Tony Wheatley.  It appealed to me big time right from the first play. He was an excellent teacher as I came second in my first game (Tony won), won my second then had a very educational third later in the convention.  Resource management, adaptability and timing is the name of the game.

My favourite Euro game of all time. Plays in 40 minutes, plenty of choices and possible to win with many different strategies. Some find it too mathematical (calculating long term score potential) but always good for a close finish.

Although it is a fun, light game it has a definite run-away problem. Especially in two player games, if someone starts getting more money in the first three rounds, one might as well stop playing as it seems virtually impossible to keep up. In 3 or more player games the problem isn't quite as bad (less money is needed since the good stuff is bought by everyone) but also harder to control by defensive play.

I esp. like this with 2P and that is what I play the most. There seems to be an imbalance to the scoring for aristocrats compared to buildings and newer players tend not to understand that and buy buildings and lose but if you are aware of this it can be VERY good...strength of mistriss on first turn and observatory makes game slightly broken...better online as can be fiddly

Great game, but seems to get less play since we got into San Juan.  Its a little more involved and a little longer, but very similar.  So, this makes it less likely to be played than San Juan when in the mood for this type of game.  However, it is still different enough to get a few plays in now and then.

In early St. Petersburg, players are acquiring workers, buildings and aristocrats. In this card game, each card has a cost, a monetary payout and victory point worth.  Decision making on whether to go after more money or VPs, while watching when the game may end. Very clean mechanism, good game and leaves you wanting to play again. The 4 player PC solitaire game available here on BGG is quite good.

Untested. Per houjix's "Couples Games" list: "For some reason we both enjoy this one quite a bit as well. It's another one without much theme and it's also quite mathematical. It plays surprisingly well with two (perhaps even better than with more). We play this one quite a bit against each other on BSW because it's even faster (and she doesn't have to worry about constant counting and card sorting)."

RATING: 7
Unique game that's a simplistic implementation of engine building, type management, future planning and manipulating how the game flows. Enjoyable experience but the key flaw is the advantage of going first swings the game: some players get access to a great card when they go first, others won't on their turn to go first. Luck of the draw and not a lot can be done about it. New reprint has excellent artwork but can't comment about gameplay:

Another medium-lightweight that manages to strike the right balance between luck and strategy. Feels and plays more like card game. But it is a definite addictive substance in our family. Works well with 2-players as an added bonus. A game that has stood the test of time very, very well and it gets regular table time every year. The game necessitates the fixing of the all too powerful Mistress of Ceremonies, which is easily done if you have the Saint Petersburg Expansion.

"Better than San Juan"?  Apples and oranges, but I still disagree.  This is an excessively computational game in which there is often one move you can make which is obviously superior to all others, and every veteran player approaches the game pretty much the same way.  It also doesn't help that you're already half-way to victory if you're lucky enough to get a first-turn Judge or Mistress of Ceremonies.  I don't hate the game, but I've had my fill of it.

RATING: 6
Don't judge this one by your first impression - multiple plays were needed before I appreciated this game. My first game was a disaster - I had no idea what I was trying to do until more than halfway through the game (it didn't help that I was taught the game by a native German speaker that couldn't convey much subtlety in English, so I was given the how-to but none of the why). Subsequent playings revealed some very interesting strategies, though I do question if one (collecting aristocrats) is maybe too powerful. I look forward to exploring this game some more and seeing if my concerns are valid or if the game has even more layers waiting to be discovered. ***UPDATE 8/13/04*** After many more plays, I am convinced that you must focus on the aristocrat race. Assuming all players understand this, the game then devolves into a pretty banal race to see who gets the best cards on their turn. You can try and convince me otherwise (especially those delusional souls that compare this game to Puerto Rico - blasphemy!) but I have played enough of this game in particluar and of these games in general to know what I'm talking about.***UPDATE 5/14/05*** After more than a hundred computer games and half-a-dozen more face-to-face meetings, I feel I have to bump the rating to a 6... regardless of the game's limitations, I still enjoy playing it, and that's the bottom line, right?

Plays like a card game with some unusual mechanics, in particular the scoring rounds and the way cards are refreshed. There's quite a bit of medium- to long-term planning, as well as a bit of luck. However, like San Juan, it's possible there's just one valid winning strategy, with circumstance (luck of the draw, and, in St. Petersburg's case, turn order) dictating the tactics used to achieve it.

This is a game I had been willing to play since long. I even bought the expansion for cheap time ago knowing that I was going to buy the base game, but it became out of print. A new edition was published recently, but my expansion is not compatible and will have to go.

The game is way simpler than I imagined. But even with this simple rules, the game packs lots of decisions with several ramifications in a relatively short playing time.

There doesn't seem to be a dominant strategy. 

2 player games are quite different.

One of my favorite games. You can visualize St. Pete being built as you play it. The game play is simple enough to understand, but there is a lot of game there nonetheless. With mostly new players it can run around an hour and a half, though more experienced players can finish in 45 minutes to an hour. Whoever is at the table, though, will likely enjoy this game as it just seems to work.

NOTE: I like to trash talk (in good fun) during this game, pointing up the limited builds of my rivals and the exquisitive contributions I have made to the Tsar's city.

I really enjoy this game!  With experienced players this game goes quick.  Not as good with new players who don't understand the value of aristocrats.  As long as everyone understands the impact of the endgame aristocrat scoring, I have a great time every time I play this.  We always play with the expansion now, except for the "Debtor's Prison" building, which is our new standard for the definition of "broken."

RATING: 7
Sankt Petersburg is a perfect example of a German-styled engine game, and has got a quite clear mechanic that can be explained easily: starting with a limited sum of money, players have got to buy and display cards on their boards that bring them money and points. This proceeds in four phases with separate scorings.

Even though the outcome of the game can be decided by luck in quite a harsh way, Sankt Petersburg offers variety from one play to another as money and points are seldom available at the same time (if at all). Plus, managing resources is especially tricky - more often than not players have got to walk on a thin rope not to become bankrupt.

RATING: 9.5
Intriguing fare that always refuses to conform with expectations. A surprisingly non-linear strategy, at the same time very dependent on the other players, and there are a few neat twists thrown in. I can't say I'm fond of the card art or the nasty paper money, though, and collecting aristocrat cards is marginally overpowered if you have more than two players. Some rather silly license taken with the theme: how many pubs have, exactly, been upgraded to the Winter Palace in the past?

Further Thoughts: Upgraded from 7 to 8, and further to a 9, purely on the selfish whim that I'm starting to get quite good at it.

St. Petersburg is one of my favorite games to play.  It is essentially a card game with money and a game board used for displaying the cards and the scoring track.  At its core, it's an engine building game (money, points).  Throughout the game players must decide how to invest their money.  Workers do not produce any points but do provide income;  buildings provide points but no income; nobles provide money and/or points but at a lower rate than workers and builders.  Nobles however have an end-game scoring bonus.  The winning player is often the one who best times the shift from money to points.  Additionally players may take up to three cards and keep them 'in hand'.  They must pay for them by game end or lose points.  While simple, balancing this mechanic is essential for winning the game.  This game sees a lot of plays in my game group.  I consider it a classic for its elegant design and high replay value.

The game plays much faster once all players are familiar with the mechanics.  The scoring track could have been done better (its too easy to knock off the pieces and the spaces don't accommodate multiple pieces very well).  The cards are on good stock and small enough to not take up much space but large enough to be readable.  The "Observatory" card is a bit too powerful if only one comes out in the early game.  The game play is good and rich/varied enough for multiple plays (i.e., no one master strategy that always wins).  Like many games, money is important early on but fades as the game nears the end (though it does still count for points at the end).

With 2 or more, it's a nice concept. Of course watch the other enough, so you get more interaction and more fire. No hard rules to make a good game. Unfortunately, with a lot of cards so it's hard to play it outside under average weatherconditions.

El Zar busca modernizar su imperio reubicando su capital en la ciudad de San Petersburgo. Esto genera un masivo traslado de la Corte a la ciudad y la necesidad de construir todas las comodidades necesarias para acomodarlos. En San Petersburgo los jugadores representarán a nobles prominentes que contratarán trabajadores y construirán edificios para obtener Rublos y atraer aristócratas para aumentar su prestigio.

San Petersburgo es un juego muy fácil de aprender. En cada fase del turno habrá 8 cartas que los jugadores podrán comprar y esto se repetirá cuatro veces en cada turno (para trabajadores, edificios, aristócratas y comercio). Esa genial simplicidad lo hace muy accesible a todo tipo de jugadores.

El encanto de San Petersburgo es que es adictivo. Con una dinámica muy fluida, el juego terminará en una media hora y siempre dejará las ganas de volver a jugar, para probar nuevas estrategias y combinaciones de cartas. La estética está muy bien adaptada a la temática y se pueden reconocer entre las cartas algunos edificios emblemáticos de la ciudad.

Excellent game that's mid-weight and easy to relearn and teach. A great game for week nights and perfect for 2-players. In this game you have 4 stacks of cards (workers, buildings, aristocrats and upgrade cards). The first phase of the game you may purchase workers or any remaining cards on the board from previous rounds. At the end of the phase you will be paid the coin amounts on the cards displayed in front of you. Next phase you can purchase buildings and at the end of the phase you will score victory points. The 3rd phase you may purchase aristocrats, which will also bring money and possibly victory points. And the last phase you can purchase upgrades to your currently purchased cards.

It's all very simple, the cards are displayed each phase for you to peruse and decide what works best for your strategy. There are 3 things you can do on a turn: 1. Purchase a card and display it in front of you, 2. Take a card into your hand and buy it later and 3. Pass

Set collection works so well in that it allows for cheaper costs on like items and provides a great way to upgrade these cheap cards later. 

Wonderful game that we have had for some time and gets few plays, but when it comes out we enjoy it greatly.

RATING: 7.5
It's a deceptively simple game of decision-making. The crux of the game seems to be when to stop trying to maximise income and when to start maximising aristocrats. Enjoyable, but I can see that it might not be that replayable. {Edit, Actually I am finding this surprisingly replayable, even though I always lose to my partner!)

I'm glad I didn't read this site before we bought this game for my brother-in-law for Christmas.  We loved the game!  After 2-3 games, we all thought we had mastered the common Aristocrat strategy that so many complain of.  But we found that tweaking that strategy for nuances was really fun.  My wife just won with a building strategy I thought was premature, but she stayed close enough in the Aristocrat race to leverage her game-long building point advantage.

I love the balancing act of buildings vs. everything else, the balancing of your hand, keeping track of future slots, risk taking--whether you can leave something to the next turn or go for it on the bottom row, the timing of purchases from your hand, prioritizing different types of upgrades, and the occasional successful denial of a crucial Aristocrat, etc.  Comebacks are difficult, but very fulfilling when accomplished.  

And unlike most, I LOVE the look of this game.  I love the funky character drawings, the neat historical buildings, the slightly-off-the-normal colors of the cards, and the look of the money.  I like the symbols on the cards, the neat, golden wood versions of the symbols, and the colorful, but muted board.  Take a minute to look at the background details of the board--it's quite nice.   

One small negative--the money is little and slick and kind of hard to use.  We also dislike the game with 2 players.  It's too tit-for-tat and boring.  It's already a game of small dollar by dollar differences--it needs that little bit of unpredictable human factor and worrying about 3 or 4 slots available for cards to make 
it fun.  
The game also occupies a unique niche because I have not played anything similar.  As I said, there a few similarities to other games in terms of being efficient from a common set of options, but the duplication and row mechanisms and tiny dollar by dollar savings to manipulate are unique.  Not everyone will like this, but you should try it.

50+ plays. Simple money into VP's game, but executed nicely enough that the replayability continues to surprise me. In fact it's turned into one of our 30-40 minute staples, and it's shined as we've all grown experienced with it together. After playing the expansions, we've gone back to the simplicity of the original. A lot of the early game is scripted, so it goes pretty fast at least, but the decisions start to flow from rounds 2 and 3 on when you're making decisions on buildings vs aristocrats, what to hold in your hand, and what to gather now so as to ensure that you'll get something on the next turn.

RATING: 7
Nice game, with fairly straightforward rules, and the few "special ability" cards are quite simple. 

This is a game of rhythms and patterns. To become proficient, I think you not only need to play several games, but within a small enough time period that you can apply what you have learned and build your skills.

Money management is definitely one key, which includes choosing the right cards at the right times. If you are just a couple rubles short now and then, it can really hurt you. Knowing who choses first in the next phase is also important. Plus there are a few cards that are especially strong (but not overpowered).

It's not aggressive, but there are some subtle interactions beyond just taking a card someone else needs (which only rarely hurts them more than you). Notably taking more or fewer cards from the pool causes fewer or more cards to get drawn in the next phase, which can have quite an effect.

The "rules" weight is probably a 2, while the "strategy" weight is probably a 3.

You would never think this game was designed by the same guy that designed Stone Age, which came later.  An entirely different game.  You draft cards in different phases, some to generate income and some to generate points.  The game emphasizes timing, efficiency, hand and money management.  If you read the rules, it does not grab you.  But the gameplay is much more interesting than the rules make it sound.  Not sure if I like the expansion.  As long as you use the adjusted scoring in the forums for end game aristocrat points, I believe the game is fine as is.

RATING: 5
A city-building card game that reminds me of San Juan in feel, although the mechanics are more complex.  San Juan is a hand management game, Saint Petersburg is a card drafting game.  Although I said it is more complex than San Juan, it doesn't feel heavy, or draggy.  Saint Petersburg is just a nice medium weight euro.

Although it is over-boxed, it has high quality bits: gilded highlights on linen finish cards, golden wooden tokens, and a board that does not have much purpose, but does organize the game in a helpful manner, and track victory points.

[update]Saint Petersburg has a particularly nasty zero-sum "economic snowball".  That means, if you are playing someone who knows what they are doing, and you make one wrong move early in the game, you are likely to lose by 40 points or so. Your opponent could easily double your score.  It is a very brutal game.  I have dropped my rating by a point and I'm not sure if I want to keep it.  

Also, the aristocrats are overpowered, and the buildings are underpowered. That bugs me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great investment game that's as much about manipulating what cards will be available as it is actually getting cards.  I really love this manipulation aspect, as well as the hand management decisions that the game forces you to make.  There's often a fine balance between trying to build up your income and trying to get sources of points, and you have to change your focus at the right time.

First impression after one play: I love this middle-weight (light?) game! Pretty cards/board also. Update: After numerous online plays (BSW) I find the game to be pretty simple, and somewhat formulaic. I enjoy the mechanics very much, the theme, the pieces, so I will keep playing. But I wonder if we very equal players this game comes down to simply card draws... I will keep playing and see. Dropping rating to 7...

12/11/05: down to 5 now after 10 more plays on BSW. I will play here only most likely, unless I encounter a friend who wants to battle it out for some reason. Problem is, I will crush any newbies I play, making this hard to introduce - it's not really worth the time to give someone a chance to get good at it.

1/17 Okay, a month later and I have gotten much better at online play, and I am starting to understand the subtleties somewhat. Almost broke it out as a 4-player f-t-f, but no go yet. I have played many games on BSW, it's my first choice there now.

8/07 I have this down now, and I win about 75% of my games online (BSW). Do not enjoy this as much face to face, but it has become my first choice on BSW, and I've played it at least 100 times.

Very nice, although the game is a bit repetitive and the strategy does not give many possible choices, but to buy many workers as fast as possible at the beginning. The problem is the total absence of interaction, but to buy useless cards to take them away from your opponent. At the end of the game, you feel like having spent some time alone, and meet your friends that just arrived. Works really well with 2 players, of course maintaining the total lack of interaction. A good point is that the strategy changes a lot depending from the number of players: with more players money is less and palaces importance changes. The rule about which you don't get more points by having more than 10 nobles is good when in two players, because you need to buy otherwise useless palaces, but even reduces interaction making even less useful to buy nobles and exchange cards to contrast the opponent. In a 2 player game the exchange cards IMHO are almost always completely useless, unless they have special capabilities, in which case they are even too powerful. Not very well balanced after all.

Simple buy-cards-and-have-victory-points game, but it has some deeper value. Of course it's heavily luck based that which cards are shown and which your opponents buy.
Also cunning systems are the expansions (if you buy any, you'll just probably be left without any money to buy proper basic green cards).
Another cunning one is the changing starting player on every round. Set taking aspect is in the orange cards, which also give you bonuses if you have many different kinds of them at the game's end.
It feels as if there are various tactics and ways to win, definitely a game which gives you something to explore for a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I figured out why I disliked this game so. Phase one with the workers allow you to formulate your own stategy: +1. Phase 3 is a simple gold : points ratio; no choice on my part since not taking the best move would be hilariously dumb: -1. Phase 3 has a probability to tie in to your phase 1 strategy, but most likely not: -0.5. Phase 4 is the same as phase 3, but less likely to do with your own plan: -0.75. Total: -1.25.

UPDATE: 5 years later and I kind of chilled on this game, but not really. I still find the actions to doing well fairly obvious and it lacks what I consider interesting decisions. I can see why some people like it. I'm leaving the embarrassing sperg to remind myself not to sperg that hard again.

A game based in Russia and a game I loved the first time I played it! The tales of St Petersberg are of corruption and crime. This game is a drafting game in essence and what you draft gains you benefits. Standard euro fair in the USSR and a lot of fun too. You get workers for money, buildings for points and influencal leaders for bonus points! Did I mention the upgrades? Good, Good, Good! It's a very tight game, so when I find out that some of the cards are overpowered I shriek in terror. The game you win, is only won in vain because you bought the broken cards. So the pleasure of winning the game with your wits is taken away. If they fix it, I would maybe buy this game again, however my good will has gone as I am dismayed by the corruption. I understand there is an expansion,that fixes this problem, it changes the game though- so this game had to go.

Didn't make the cut- I don't keep broken games.

After two plays, I'm torn. I enjoy the engine building and I'm a sucker for quick-playing economic card games, but there seems to be a lot of luck with players having first shot at the best cards. A few more plays will tell whether these have been fluke games or whether a better strategy can mitigate the bad luck.

In real life I love pinching pennies and trying to get as much value as I can for every dollar I spend. This has made StP a good game for me.

Only one play so far. I'm almost sure we played this wrong because 45 minutes in and we seemed to be maybe 20% into the game, so we declared it a draw. Clearly there is some timing or resource exhaustion rule that we missed, or perhaps this is one of those games that ramps and ends incredibly fast and we stopped just before that ramp. But even so, the mechanics and strategy were fascinating. I'm rating it a 7 even based on a truly weird first play. We both agreed: "Um - I'm almost certain we did that wrong, but it was hella fun anyway."

*Update
Yep. Watching Tom/Melody Vasel's playthrough, I discovered that the problem was that I was not flushing the lower row of cards at the end of the round. As a result, things stacked up and the momentum of the game stalled.

But, now that I am aware of that rule, the game flows well. In fact, not only doesn't it slow down, but it has a hockey-stick ending that becomes almost a desperate sprint at the end. Very fun game - upgrading rating to an 8.

While I didn't play this game well at all on my single play, I get the sense that there is something here to my liking. Maybe once I play it a little more, then I'll be better able to judge. But I do like the thematic layout, which is largely pasted on, but evokes some nice St Pete atmosphere.

Rating keeps going up and up after more playings.  WONDERFUL 2-player game, good for 3-player, TERRIBLE for 4-players.  Fans of Princes of Florence & Puerto Rico will probably like this one however - Nothing new with this one either.  No new/unique mechanics although you make agonizing decisions each turn.  Extremely well balanced however, bit of a 1 game learning curve.  Bits, cards, & illustrations are surperb, theme fits nicely as too.

Purchased and played once.  I enjoy it but my gaming buddy doesn't.  He's of the AP breed and for him its too much.  Myself, I liked it.  I like these kinds of card games, but it won't be played again any time soon as the theme doesn't call out to a lot of folks.. not when there's other potential games in this kind of category (Race for the Galaxy, Dominion, Galaxy Trucker and Agricola (to a lesser extent).

Mediocre desire to play again.

RATING: 7
The money/vp problems makes the play interesting but the economically astute will, I feel, run away with the scoring.
I don't have a head for this kind of economic maths, and at 90mins a game so far doesn't bode well. Other elements of tactical interest are anticipating what and how many cards will come out in a phase(once you know the distributions in each deck)and who gets first pick. I had a desire to try it with 2 but I suspect the gameplay wouldn't be challenging without the competition of more players, and the tableau of cards could be overwhelming.

Update:  05/18/06
Rating increased from 7.5 to 8.
Great game, but the reasons I'm not rating it higher are the slight luck of the draw (Observatory and Mistress of Ceremonies) and the player positional right/left binding (sitting to the left of a less experienced player is a big advantage).

I will leave my original comments (below) for the record, but I have to admit most of it about the "flaw" and the value of the Observatory card were overblown. After many more plays I've concluded that this is a great game as is.

In 2- and 3-player games you don't even need the Observatory and if you concentrate too much effort on the Aristocrats, you will lose miserably. In 4-player games the Observatory and the Aristocrats become somewhat more important, but even then not to the point of guaranteeing you the game.

--------------------------------------

Original comments from 2005:

This is a fantastic game full of tough decision making and resource management. I would have rated it 8.5 (instead of 7.5) if it weren't for a major flaw (for which I'm proposing my easy fix).

The flaw is the "Observatory" card.  It is extremely powerful, and when the game is played among reasonably good players, the one who buys this card and gets to use it first, will almost always win. The 'Aristocrat' (orange) cards are key to winning this game, and the Observatory is key to winning the Aristocrat cards.

The fix to this flaw is fortunately only a simple minor rule change. This change would virtually eliminate the huge imbalancing effect of this card.

The normal rule is that the owner of the Obsevatory may pick up the top card from any of the four stacks and either buy it, reserve it for future purchase, or discard it, and 99% of the time the selected card is an Aristocrat one. My proposed change is to limit the options of the Observatoy holder to just purchasing the drawn card out right. If he doesn't have the money or chooses not to buy it, he may not discard it or reserve it to be purchased later.  Instead, the next player will have the option to buy it. If the second player also chooses not to buy it, then the third player will have the option to buy, and so on. If no one buys it, then it will go to the discard pile. In my opinion, this simple rule change will improve the game balance tremendously.  Yet, a less atractive alternative would be to simply remove the two Observatory cards from the game.

I wish luck was a little less a factor, but planning around the luck makes this game interesting. Can't imagine playing it with just two players, we played with four and I enjoyed it a lot. Having been introduced to this and Ticket to Ride on the same day i'd say that this game deserved SdJ over Ticket. 

EDIT: I've dropped my rating from an 8 to a 6 as this game just seems to center on who gets the aristocrats and little else. I find myself just not wanting to play it for it's flaws - end game aristocrat scoring and the whole "rich get richer" problem.

EDIT2: I've dropped my rating to a 4. I have no desire to play this game again. "The Rich Get Richer" is a -huge- problem and the aristocrats are the -whole- game. Nice components, though.

I really enjoy playing Saint Petersburg. At its essence this game is simply an economic engine building game. Its fun to watch your engine steadily grow.

A tight, tense card/machine building game.  The art is bright and atmospheric; reminiscent of Eastern European icon paintings. The gameplay is clever and full of tough decisions every time. Can be a little challenging to teach, but once everyone gets the hang of it, the game is fast and tactical fun. There's some luck of the draw, but it helps to keep the game fresh, rather than turning it into a fortune-fest 
A couple of complaints: the tiny cards are a bit flimsy, and I despise paper money.  So, the component quality is tolerable (and probably necessary), but I like what I like.

Good little game that plays fast. The material is O.K. but the board is superb. Of course luck plays a role in the outcome of the game. But it's also a matter of choosing the right card at the right moment. The kind of game that you won't play two game in a row but will come out of the closet often.

Bon petit jeu qui se joue rapidement. Le matériel est O.K. et le plateau est superbe. La chance joue son rôle dans le jeu mais c'est aussi de choisir les bonnes cartes au bon moment. C'est le genre de jeu que l'on ne jouera pas deux parties dans la même soirée, mais qui sortira du placard souvent au courant d'une année.

Now I see where 7 Wonders took half of its inspiration from. A very basic and streamlined Card-Euro / Efficiency engine game with a terrible theme and artwork. It does not play very elegant and will probably be solved after half a dozen plays, there is just not enough variety in the cards to make this epic or engaging enough. And being a simple game like that, there is just not enough excitement, speed or luck in the game. 

EDIT: Played it again, and it's not all that bad just outdated and ugly as hell.

March 2015: The new version from Z-Man Games is even uglier than the original. It adds a new mechanism (area majority scoring) that makes the game even more fiddly.

As with the base game, it's still strategically one-dimensional: Focus first on income, then ensure that you're getting points from all point sources. Choices are annoyingly limited because among the eight cards to draft from, most of them are either too expensive, or near the end game, too useless for VPs.

Nov 2008: Rating dropped from 5 to 4. Better with more players than with less just because the game goes by faster.

Way too processional, and hardly interactive.

RATING: 7.25
This was a very simple and enteraining game.  There are four phases to a turn.  You score on the first three phases, while the fourth allows you to upgrade.  The first phase there is a round where everyone can buy laborer(s).  At the end you earn money (likely) and points (unlikely).  The second phase you purchase buildings.  At the end you earn money (unlikely) and points (likely).  The third phase you can buy a specialist.  At the end you earn money (unlikely) and points (likely).  During the fourth phase you can upgrade any of the three previous round cards.

Full of tough decisions and multiple paths to victory, just what I like in a game.  Players interact by taking the resources the other players are trying to get.  I could wish for a little more direct interaction, along the lines of Boomtown though.  I like the cycling turn order method, but I'm not entirely sure it evens out, since first choice in the first worker phase is WAY better than last choice, but the choices in upgrade phase are pretty much dictated by what each player can upgrade.  At least it balances it out a little. Overall, a very interesting game that I look forward to playing again.

This is a cool little game.  I like building an economic engine.  Saint Petersburg is the perfect game for someone who thinks they like monopoly because you get to build a money generating empire.  I am a fan of card games, so this game appeals to my love of randomness, but it is possible to lessen randomness because the decks are very balanced.  There are a lot of the same type of cards in the worker deck, which prevents one player from "taking all the good ones" and there is also a lot of variety and players have the ability to specialize.  It's a pretty cool game.

The game is a super filler.  Good game for what it is, but one that I would only visit once in a while.

Saint Petersburg is a game I judged by its cover for way too long. After one play its easy to understand its popularity. Definitely a classic.

I really enjoyed collecting the unique orange cards, which award a ton of end game points. Watch your opponents closely there.

An engaging game centered around finding a balance of making money vs. making points. In the beginning, spend money to make money, but as the game progresses use your rubles to score points.

Cleverly-constructed card game based on a "web of cards" which players must weave to eke out money (for better cards) and victory points (for winning).

While mechanically different, this game hits me a lot like Ra. It's mechanically adequate (as an economic engine building game), it's relatively quick and the rules are clean (read: no fussy contextual special rules) and easy to convey to new players.

That said, the cards are unbalanced and each player's ability to grab them (turn order) is random. All in all, it just feels like it lacks 'true' decision making.

it also suffers from king making in the final round.

Have played many times now.  This game has grown on me, I've changed my rating from a 5 to a 7.
GOOD BITS:
-- Many subtle decisions.
-- Plays quite quick and makes a good two player game.

BAD BITS:
-- Some basic cards broken.  I've hand drawn the errata in my set.
-- Rich get richer game.  Sometimes a player falls hopelessly behind.

HOUSE RULE:
-- In two player game on first turn the first player can buy most expensive and least expensive peasant, or the middle two, their choice.  This helps prevent one player from getting a big head start early.

This is an easy game to teach and it plays pretty quickly.  Everything is really tight.  Maybe even too tight for me to truly enjoy.

I feel like I need to find a better strategy for this game.  So far our plays have been totally determined by who was lucky enough to get into a good card early enough to carry them to the win.  Every game.

I'm sure there is a good counter to this "strategy", but I haven't yet figured it out.  If I am able to figure out how to remove the luck from this game, I'll rate it higher.

RATING: 7
Rather quick playing Euro-style card game. In the beginning you mainly invest in your money-engine (green cards) and switch later to victory point generation by  buying either buildings (continuous VP generation) or nobles (massive scoring at the end). The game rewards collecting sets of the same building (decreased price). This also contributes to the level of randomness, which I  think to be quite high (you can get a very good start if you either get cheaper crafstmen or a set of your craftsmen with fitting upgrades). 

The art-work is not very appealing, but the design is still very functional and fits to the game's quick playing nature. The down-side of this is that St. Petersburg feels very mechanical. Additionally there is not a lot of interaction between the players.

Engraçado mas muito pesado, este não é um jogo para todos. Demora a entrar no sistema, tem muito que pensar e mesmo assim não é facil de agradar a um público que gosta mais de variedade de acções. É uma obra de arte, reconheço, mas para um público muito restrito. É também um postal da sociedade russa clássica, em especial de São Petersburgo através dos monumentos, pelo que pode ser mais fácil de cativar os nativos ou os amantes desta cultura.

I have played this about 16 times, both with and without the expansion cards.  It usually gets played once or twice at each monthly game session, usually as a filler.  Enjoyable, but not what I look forward to at games day.  Most of my group really likes this and I find it interesting enough, but a bit burned out on it. (18 MAY 2008)  We have been playing with the new expansion which I find improves the game.  Rating changed back to 7. (2009 JAN 04)

Only played it once so far and as a two-player game (which is how some people say it plays best). We enjoyed it and look forward to playing it again. Some of the rules and exceptions get a bit confusing, however, and we did misplay a number of the special cards the first time through.

I enjoy it a lot. It's pretty tactical, which means I'm bad at it, or maybe there is a long strategy that I don't get. Either way I'm not good at it, but I like it. It's like proto deck-building.

We are having a blast playing this one. It seems people are either really big fans of this one or don't care for it at all. We enjoyed it a lot. It can be tough on newbies because it is a bit unforgiving and once behind it's hard to catch up. But, man, once ya get it, it's sure addictive. Scales well with 4-player being best. It also plays in 45 - 60 minutes.

You know, normally I hate games of buy-stuff-to-get-money-to-buy-stuff games, especially where everybody has their own little mat. But, I dunno, I like this game. Maybe it's because it's closer to a game like Ra, where what's going on on your mat is totally transparent, and less close to, say, Puerto Rico, where you're concentrating on some intricate system. Anyway, I'm charmed.

Game can be fun at first, but becomes a bit mechanical after a few plays.  Plays quickly which is a bonus for a light resource management game.

My ratings in general seem to be skewed high, but that's because I try only to buy/play games that I like.

This one fits the bill.  A sense of slow development and empire building.  Buy things to fund the purchase of other things.

This is definitely a game where experienced players will beat beginners -- usually by a long shot.  On the other hand, I'm not sure how many different avenues there are to winning -- a collection of aristocrats seems to  be the key (although I once won a game -- and only one game -- without a single aristocrat).

22-02-2015. Rated after 1 play. We played a basegame with some expansions thrown in. Saint Petersburg is a fun engine-building game.

Each turn, resolves around going through 4 phases (green for workers, blue for buildings, orange for nobles and multicolored stuff). Each phase begins with drawing up cards so that there are 8 cards available for purchase. All players then take turns buying and building cards and drawing cards into the hand (up to 3), or pass. If you build a card, some need to replace other cards AND you can build over another building for a discount of the cost of the previous building. After all players have consecutively passed, the phase ends. After the end of each phase, you score the VPs and get income for the cards in the color of the phase you have built.

Saint Petersburg is a fun game, but prone to an explosion of AP because you get more and more cards/abililties/ stuff to look at. I think the game is best with 2 or 3 likely, and as I played with 5 I felt downtime was a little heavy.

This is a fun and easy game.  My biggest complaint is that the cards get overwhelming and there is no good way to sort them other than in a huge set in front of you, and by the end of the game it is a lot (this is probably especially true at 2 players, which is what we played).  The mechanics are easy and the theme is cute, although not very deep. (JW)

RATING: 7
A tight game about properly managing your limited amount of funds to purchase the right cards at the right time and make sure you save enough to catch a new opportunity. My biggest complaint is that the last turn can often be totally anticlimactic with nothing to do. Not something I want to play over and over again but still pretty good every so often. Much improved with poker chips instead of paper money.

RATING: 6.5
*TRADED*Good game, I prefer it with 2 players, but works fine with 3 or 4. Fair element of luck, but can be minimized with good play. Easy to teach, moderate game. Edit: Dropping on my list. Dropping fast. I think this gets boring after playing it more. Its got a very scripted feel, and equally matched players can have games that are swung way to much by some lucky cards.

RATING: 8
This is a game that gets better with each play for me. I went through a phase during games 5-10 where I felt I understood everything this game had to offer and didn't think I'd like to play it much longer. Then I started understanding the relationships between cards and the different playing styles one can use. The gameplay is a lot deeper now and seems to improve the more I play. You definately need to learn how to pace out your purchases and control your "impulse buying" to improve your competitiveness. I believe this is a fun thinking game that will see many more plays at my table.

An all-time favorite at my house. Just the right playing time and amount-of-think for me.

I will admit that game is a little fragile with regard to having a new player at the table, introducing some unfortunate negative seat-order binding. My rating is for the game when played between players of similar experience levels.

I am also quick to say that the original game has some issues with a few cards. When we play outside of a competitive setting, we always play with the Tom Lehman set of nerfed cards. And the only reason we play the "Original" in a competitive setting is because old-timers object to trying anything else.

A very typical Deutsch game where you gain money at the early game and then gradually convert it into VP, and also where you draft cards from a public cardlist following particular player order. However it is very difficult to find out the right timespot indicating the beginning of gaining VP, that said, even an average player may miss the best chance of go-nut scoring and end up with a lot of money rotting in hand. This is especially true when facing an Expert AI in the PC version. There are truely a lot to dig out.

There are many different things you can succeed with although the outcome usually depends on some right cards showing up at the right time. The best score varies a lot from game to game and I see that as a good thing since it brings variation to the game.

It's a good game of economic management - building up your money supply and managing your finances to enter the building market to score some victory points - and also getting those aristrocrats on your side. I think the board in this game is very useful and makes the presentation of the game neat and organised. Unfortunately I don't see much variety in strategy between games and managing to get the Observatory card often seems to make the difference between getting nine or ten aristocrats. I prefer to play with four over three.

Perhaps the geekiest game ever.  Hardly any fun at all, but compelling and interesting to play.  My only complaint about it is that there are limited winning strategies.  It's pretty much: a.) grab as many workers as you can get early; b.) grab the aristocrats to produce the second tier of income; then c.) make up for lost time on the buildings.  It's not that simple of course, but it's not that far from the mark either.  Beautiful art on the board and the cards.  Doing the math and paying out the money is a drag.  All in all, I like the game, but I can see playing it less and less every year.

A fabulous two-player game masquerading as a multi-player game.  For two players, I rate this 9.  For three, I rate it an 8.  For four player, it's a bit of a crap-shoot (it's probably a 7 though.)  It still deserves all the awards it got though.  Watch out for the "this is routine" phase that sets in after about five games though; there's more to it than that.

One of those games where those who have played the most will almost always win. I get the feeling that the strategic options are more limited than first appears. Nonethless, a good game but not fanatical as some seem to be. 
Upped my rating from 5 to 7 after playing it again some 3 years later.

I plyed my first game of St. Petersburg this past weekend.  I thought it was a little dry.  There are a few not-so complicated decisions to make, and once you realize the administrator bonus is as big as it is, you just start hoarding them.  

Not to mention the fact that the board is largely frivolous when it comes to the actual gameplay.  You could easily substitue a scratch pad and a pencil if the board were damaged for some reason.  

Perhaps with additional play I'd enjoy the game more.  But on my first play, I'd only call it slightly above average.  I would play it again, however.

RATING: 5
Two plays so far, both plagued with runaway leaders. This could be due to our unfamiliarity of proper tactics, but since there is very little player interaction, slowing down a leader seems improbable.  I'd like to play a few more times and try with 2-players before rending a final rating, but if there is no "a-ha" moment in them, the rating will be a 5.

I have never actually played this gameout of the boxm but I STRONGLY suspect that much like San Juan, this game is great if you don't have to physically play it. I.e. play it online at BSW, but for me it looks like too much work to play the game for how fun or rewarding it is.

RATING: 5
I like this game, with the press-your-luck choices, now-or-later choices and set collection on steroids. Feels a little dry sometimes though, and having money be hidden information is very annoying, and takes a lot away from player interaction. Some cards seem to disrupt balance. I'm interested to see how the expansion addresses the game balance.

Big weakness is the game becomes pretty straightforward once you work out some simple strategic rules you should follow. Then it just becomes luck of the card draw. Tough decisions still come up from time to time, however.

Like this with 3. It's a little too luck-dependent between 2 experienced players. And sitting down for 45 minutes and alternating between picking up cards just looks like a dry and lame thing to do for 2 players.

Pretty cool card game.  Reminds me a bit of San Juan.  I like it, but if you make a mistake early, you are totally screwed.  Your opponent essentially has to make an equally grievous (or worse) error for you to catch up.  I'll play it, but it certainly wouldn't be a top choice for me because of the inability to catch up.  I would rank it higher if not for that.

Despite this fact, I have raised my rating another point as playing live with people who know how to play makes a big difference.

Like it alot.  Definate weak and strong cards.  Getting first buy on some can really skew things - this is my only problem with game.  But, even so, can still overcome, because things often balance out.  Quick moving, hits the sweet spot.  One of two 10s out there.

St. Petersburg -- Played three- and four-player.  Upon my first play, I thought there was something inelegant about the game-flow, and the play itself had a mechanical quality.  That said, I had a really good time playing it, once I knew how the moves go.  

After a second playing, my only complaint is that you must be familiar with the various upgrade cards to play strategically.  The play itself is both fun and satisfying.  I'd like to get to know this one better.

After my third play (second with three players), I see how much more balanced and strategic the game becomes when all players are familiar with the card distribution, and the game-flow in general.  Our scores were 77, 76, and 73.  I love a tight game!

Very good game about money management. The aristocrats strategy seems to be slightly dominant, but you still need to be well adaptive to the current situation. Good knowledge of the cards helps a lot (e.g. beginner has almost no chance to win against experienced player).

RATING: 3
A deeply flawed game with some nifty mechanics which don't really coalesce into any sort of balance. It is reasonably fun to play, but after a few games the problems begin to surface.

It is easy to fall behind at the beginning and stay behind the whole game. There is really nothing you can do to catch up.

The random nature of not only what flips up, but how many, means that players almost always win just by being in the right seat at the right time.

The Observatory is broken if it shows up in the first round of the game.

And the aristocrat bonus makes the building points practically useless. I tried having the buildings give an additional bonus points at the end of the game, but it wasn't enough.

Suggest:

2 pts/aristocrat at the end of the game, period.

Eliminate the Observatory or make it a "use once and discard" building.

Auction off turn order each phase, or try something like Power Grid auctions.

RATING: 6
Played once with 4P. A rather dry and calculative game, with the calculation bit providing room for downtime in the game. Games against the AI can be finished in mere minutes, in comparison to the only face-to-face game I played which took 1.5 hours. 

I like how cards are which are not sold off gradually clog the display and are sold off with a small discount the next round if you wait. The ability to hold on to cards seems quite simple, but also provides some of the more challenging decisions in the game. Apart from those plus points, this is an economic engine-building game where most of the parts aren't too exciting. Knowing the deck definitely helps, although buying nobles seems to be the default strategy as their endgame bonus is huge. I'm not really inspired by the dry maths involved, but this isn't a bad game either.

Multiple paths to victory and the need to be as efficient as possible make this an interesting game.  Like many games I enjoy, this is full of hard choices because you don't have enough resources (money) to do everything you'd like to.  It's also quick, especially with experienced players.

Works very well with both 2 and 4 players.  Haven't played with 3 yet.

[107 plays] A highly addictive card game, with elegant economics that demand solid strategy.

This game is a ton of fun, with nice artwork, swift mechanics, and anxious decisions. Superb.

My rating on this in the beginning was 9, got as high as 10, then it slipped back to 9 after about 25 games. Then we backed off and starting playing it far less frequently. That helped, it is back to a 10 and should stay there for me for a very long time. 

I've added the expansion to my base game and won't likely play without it again. 

I was reminded in a recent play just how great this game can be with 3 or 4 players - not just with 2 as most of my plays have been.

#26 on my Top 100 Games of All Time (2015)

I really enjoy this game as it is my ideal weight and length, and I think it has some interesting strategy decisions. However, it is also a BRUTAL economic game. If you don't make the right moves early, like building up your income, then you won't be able to recover and will get snowballed. Chalk it up to a learning experience and keep playing cause this game is worth it!

Excellent board/card game. It looks great, it's easy to teach, and there are more than enough tactics to keep it interesting. The game is often criticized because building is not a viable strategy, but I've found that buildings can play an important role, especially in a 2-player game. St Petersburg, and to a lesser extent Carcassonne, are like "comfort food" games that I enjoy playing when I am too tired or stressed for a heavier game.

On initial reading of the rules, the game appears to have great promise.  After many more plays with four players, the game appears to be a single strategy optimisation game. A one-trick pony sadly. A pre-requisite to victory would be 8-9 aristocrats plus other assorted buildings. A building strategy with minimal aristocrats? Only if your opponents are inept. Multiple paths to victory, no. However, the repetitive nature of the game may not lend itself to many plays except on the computer. A good but overrated game.

Card, Economic, Set Collection. Interesting game, I've only played it online but enjoyed it. I wouldn't mind getting my own copy.

Update: finally did get a copy in trade. Solid game, I really like the flow of managing your money and income from phase to phase, all while building up your economic and point engines.

UPDATE: ended up trading it away. Played some more on Yucata. It seems more and more to me that early money is soooo critical, that it overwhelms many other options during the early part of the game. That rubs me the wrong way just a bit.

I'm interested in the second edition now, though.

I played this for the first time tonight, placing 2nd in a 4 player game. The mechanics are pretty simple. It's a resource game. You buy resources and they produce either cash to buy more resources or victory points. I like the mechanic of the variable turn order and order within the turn, although I don't think we completely followed that during this game. I was leading right up until the last turn, when I realized that the more different kinds of aristocrats you had in play, the more VP's you earned at the end of game scoring. So, while I scored for having 4 different aristocrats for 10 VP's, my closest competitor scored for having 9 arist's for 45 points. He won by 12 points. Only one of the four players had played before, so it was a situation where played based on his knowledge of the rules without refering to the rule book. That lead me to believe that I would lose the number of VP's equal to the cost of whatever cards I had in my hand at the end of the game, rather than the actual rule of losing 5 VP's per card. Also, I don't think we were moving the cards from the top to bottom and then off the board correctly. But, overall I enjoyed the game. I think it's a game that my daughter and boyfriend will play. I also think my regular gaming group might like to give it a shot. There's no dice, so that's always a plus with me. ;) I know where to get this game at a good price, so I'll probably buy it.

Very attractive cards (with shiny gold ink!) and nice mechanics.  Good gaming decisions to be made with regards to developing for money or VPs.  Has a Puerto Rico-lite feel to it, which is a good thing.  <BR><BR>The game plays much different with 2 players than with 3 or 4, as there is much more money in the marketplace and aristrocrats are much more plentiful.  Proper timing of Building purchases seems to be a key of the game with two players.<BR><BR>I highly recommend playing this game with poker chips, instead of the $$$ supplied.  Chips speed up the game by 10 minutes or more.

Nagyon egyedi játék, úgy érzem több út is vezet a győzelemhez. Minden játék más, ezért az újrajátszhatósági faktora is nagy véleményem szerint. A játékosok háromféle lapot vesznek és gyűjtenek, amikkel pénzt és győzelmi pontokat kaphatnak minden adott fázis végén. Plusz a negyedik fázisban ezt a három lapfajtát fejleszthetik is, amivel még erősebb lapok lehetnek előttük. Jól meg kell gondolni minden lapvásárlást, kézbevevést (amivel késleltetni lehet az azonnal fizetést egy kártyáért és később lerakni valamikor) és nagyon figyelni a többiekre. Gyors játék, könnyű szabállyal.

[2011-10-02]
Kettőből kettő eddig és tisztán nemes stratégiával szinte. Sokszor hallottam, hogy ha többen mennek a nemesekre, akkor a szimpla nemesstratégia nem működik. Nekem eddig bejött. Érdekes módon az első játék, amire azt mondom jobb lehet interneten játszani, mint élőben, mert nagyon nagy szerepe lehet egy-egy lépésnek, amit jól át kell gondolni.

[2011-10-22]
És tényleg, ha mindenki a nemesekre megy, akkor lesz izgalmas a játék. Szóval azt tudom mondani a játékról, hogy kezdőként nehéz, hasonló szintű játékosokkal izgalmas és jó, de a szerencse is beleszólhat. A pontszám nem változik. Jó játék a Saint Petersburg, amivel bármikor szívesen játszom, de a 7 Wonders nekem jobban bejön ebből a stílusból.

I can't say that this is a bad game.  But, while I feel that the game is sound, I don't feel like I'm doing anything significant.  Most of the time this is just accounting.  

Who am I here?  

I have a couple serious gripes about the design. 

First, the interaction stinks. The most that goes on between players is that you hope that they don't take the card that you want.  

Second, this game really suffers from an exponential growth problem, if you aren't in contention for the lead at the beginning of the game you won't be at the end.  

Lastly, where are the tough choices? Most of the cards are best or second best. It feels more like an exercise than a game.  So, often it feels like you are making false decisions throughout.

Overall, I liken it to having sex with a corpse, it gets the job done, but it leaves you a bit cold.

Update: Played this yet again to give it yet another chance both live and on BSW, I decided that perhaps I should downgrade my rating.  Then I realized I was right with my initial rating.  So it remains a solid and strong 3.

Update: Hey, it's been seven years since I've played this last. I thought that I should update my rating, but it turns out that, yet again, I had the same emotional response from it as before.  Frustrating and unfulfilled.  I won and I felt like I didn't make any relevant decisions to my position, rather I just got the right cards at the right time, more than other people did.  Turn order really makes all the worst parts of this game downright stupid.

Good game. Once you get past its procedural complexity (a "Euro-game" standard, it would seem) and get a few games under your belt, you start to figure out the very tricky "cash flow" issues and start to get a feel for the value of certain cards. I have won a few games of this playing face-to-face and just recently won my first (of 37) on BSW. Luck of the "card draw" keeps this game fresh each time you sit down to play, while familiarity with procedures and cards improves effort. I wish the box game cards were a little sturdier (bigger?). Look for this at the next WBC, I'd say. Was THE "buzz" this year.

Nothing especially new here: spend money to buy things that either make money, provide VPs, or give you some long-term advantage.

Relatively quick "city building" game.  It is however really hard to time the switchover from building up income to pushing hard into victory point generation.

I really enjoyed this game. There seem to be a couple of different valid strategies to winning. My only problem with my first play was that something seemed a bit off about the pacing or length of the game. Maybe because only about 15% of the scoring track got used before the final round. Maybe it seemed to go from early game to endgame without much middle game. Still, I enjoyed the game and want to play again.

I started out very unimpressed with Saint Petersburg, as I found the art hideous and the gameplay rather uninspiring.  Well, a few more plays and I'm sold.  I even find the art comical now.

RATING: 7.5
Really a good game, but in my opinion, has some drawbacks that bring the rating down a bit. Firstly, like some other older games, it suffers from a runaway leader problem. In other words, if you make a mistake in the beginning that allows another player to get ahead, it's likely they will stay ahead and you will know shortly that you do not have any chance of winning at all. Also, relative to other euros, (such as Macao, for example) this game has a limited amount of viable options to partake in. I feel sort of forced to do certain things at certain times, which limits any feeling of control. There can be times during this game when really bad things happen to you, and it is based on luck, and there is absolutely nothing you can do about it - again, a loss of control. Other than these things, the game flows well and is quite fast, which is nice. It can feel dry and programmed though - although I must say that I have never played with the expansions - i hear they take away some of the problems inherent in the original.

RATING: 7.5
Cool decisions in this one, and it's really interesting to sometimes buy one extra card so that you'll have an opportunity in the next round to buy the next card.  Trying to have enough money and deciding when to buy cards really makes for agonizing decisions.

UPDATE: Still have to agree with the agonizing decisions, even if the decision tree is a bit limited.


UPDATE #2: I do admire how well this works as a two-player auction game, though.

This designer should make more games.  This and Stone Age are fantastic.  My wife and I played this game, more the first month of owning, than any other game in my collection.  Great economic engine builder.  Beware, novices will get destroyed by an experienced player.  The only reason I don't rate this higher, is that it can be a bad experience sometimes for some players.  This game could be retitled - "The runaway leader game."  I love the art on the older version.

Saint Petersburg isn't terrible. The core mechanic is elegant enough. The problem is, after one play the best strategy is obvious. The shape of that strategy depends on the card draw and not much else. Player choices aren't difficult once each understands how the game works. As a result, I see it playing out the same way again and again. You can block other players, but because money is so tight, the opportunity cost is high; incentives favour those who free ride on the blocking player's efforts. Fun or interesting moves are rarely optimal. It's a cold, lifeless exercise.

St. Pete is a very fun game that isn't too hard to learn. It plays like many other Euros where you focus on money early on, then ramp up the VP engine mid- to late-game.

Excellent game, will not play it without the expansion.  Optimizing your money vs victory points and knowing when to move from getting your engine going and turning into victory points is and outstanding element of the game.

Planning your turn based upon what your turn order is (and what it will be in the future turns) in the game makes it a unique experience since the cards that come up can place a little chaos in your planning.

If I don't play this often, I enjoy it when I play it.  It's a little formulaic and dry once you've played it a few times.  It also seems that once everyone picks their paths to winning, it comes down to who gets the good draw at the right times.

1st game was a LOT of fun. However, after repeated play, this is MUCH less interesting: it seems the only thing to do is to get more nobles. I have rarely seen a building-heavy strategy work. Still, because of it's easy availability on BSW and Yucata.de, I end up playing it many times.

Hopefully the expansion will improve the face-to-face experience!

RATING: 10
It really is basically a card game, with the board being superfluous, although it does look nice.  Definitely a fun card game, though, with easy to learn rules, depth, and some interesting decisions.  Should appeal to many casual and serious gamers, but perhaps not to the extremes in either group. I'm pretty sure that the noble cards are the key to victory.  Not only can you rack up a good score with them at the end of the game, but they also provide you with funds during the game, as well as a handful of victory points.  Having at least one extra helps too, so you can purchase an upgrade during the exchange phase without losing a unique card.  It's good to buy some craftsmen, especially early on, and the buildings may be overrated, although you need to have a feel for when to buy them so you don't end up with excess cash, since St. Pete is a game of extreme efficiency.  Update:  overtook Ticket To Ride as my favorite game of 2004.  Has the potential to become a classic that will be played for years to come.  Might be my favorite game since Ra.  Excellent for two, three, or four players.  How many games fit that criteria?  I'm addicted.  Further update:  THE BEST GAME EVER!

RATING: 8
I played this game just in time to keep an eye out for the second edition because I really liked it.

This is a somewhat economic tableau building game.  First, it has a really clever player order mechanic that I really enjoy.  Each round consists of 4 phases and each player in a 4 player game gets one token that represents a phase they go first in (and play continues clockwise from there during that phase).  These are passed each round so there is a neat little structure of turn order that jumps around during any individual round.

Each phase a different kind of card is drawn from a deck to fill a market track.  Players in turn order for that phase will buy these cards adding them to their tableau or take them into their hand which is limited to 3 cards.  The first phase cards will provide mostly money income, the second phase mostly points, the third phase is mostly money again but also provide large end-of-game point bonuses based on set collection.  The final phase is upgrade cards to increase the effectiveness of the cards built in the other 3 phases.

This is such a succinct and clever game, I found myself really enjoying it and there is a ton of strategy to mine out of the simple gameplay.  It's also not too hard to teach and plays at a pretty decent clip.  It is not great with 3 players though as one player each round will have 2 of the 4 phase tokens.  It is great with 4 and I've heard works well with 2 as well where each player will have 2 tokens.

Only negative thing I can say about this is "ugh, paper money".

RATING: 7
St. Petersburg is an interesting card game where you buy cards from a row of up to 8 cards in player order.  There are four types of cards, workers produce money, buildings produce VP’s, aristocrats produce money (but less than workers) but provide end game VP’s, and the fourth type is trading cards which are basically special upgrades for each of the other three types.  The game is played in phases, first the worker phase where workers are added to the board, then scored, and then it moves to building phase where buildings are purchased and scored, etc... In any case, it seems like a fine game but just another example of building your money train early and knowing when to switch gears to buying lots of VP generating cards.  It is worth more play before I commit to really liking it or not.

A very computational game, where the only main decision is when to switch from income generation to VP accumulation. I really only like it with two, as the amount of control gets too low with more. Moreover, the nobles dominate the game so much with 3 or 4, that any player who bothers with buildings is doomed. With two, buildings are a good source of VPs, giving the game more options and thus replayability.

Maybe I need to play this game some more to get this straight, but I have seen one strategy win every time I have played this game, and that just killed the fun for me.

This can't compete with most of my collection, but is a good light diversion. It is especially a 2 player game with non-gamers. I will definitely try to play it with my brother, and maybe Dandyside.

I can see why a lot of people like this game.  It has all the elements of a good Euro.  The problem I have with the game is the lack of player interaction combined with a lack of really engaging gameplay.  Basically you just go off and do your own thing and try to do it better than your opponent.  Of course this alone isn't such a bad thing, but if I'm going to play a game that lacks player interaction my solitaire experience needs to be very rewarding for me to like the game.  In the case of St. Petersburg, the solitaire experience was just okay, hence my middling rating of the game.  Part of the problem may have been that I played a 2-player game, but maybe not because others claim this is the optimal number of players resulting in the most "pure" experience the game has to offer.  If this is true, then I know for sure my rating will stay where it is.

Based on several plays.  I used to play this over lunch a couple times a week at work.  It has been an instant hit and everyone who has played it has liked it.  The time, pace, size, everything about it makes it the perfect game to bring to work and play over lunch.  It is an interesting game that offers a wide range of strategies and has a lot of good replay value.  Almost all the plays I have for this game are 4 player.  I finished 3rd place in the Gen Con 2006 tournament.  The game does have a few flaws regarding first turn cards.  If you get a Mistress, Judge, or Observatory on the first turn, you should have a decent advantage that is hard to overcome if played well.

And now, after hundreds of games vs the PC and a few more F2F plays, I can say that I do enjoy this game. Who'd of thunk that card drafting could be this fun? 

Update: Downgraded since it seems that there really is only one real path to victory.

Good for 2 players.

EDIT:  After taking a while away from this game, it was surpringly fun to come back to.  I raised it to a 7 (now 8).  From what I read, it would be a mistake to ever play this on the computer (as it probably doesn't live up to dozens of playings), so I won't be doing that.  

I play almost exclusively 2 player, and I think it is a good idea to remove the Mistress of Ceremonies cards from the deck (and I'm not normally a proponent of house rules... but those cards are broken.)

EDIT: back to 7 after more plays.  Games feel too similar to rate higher.

Of all the games I've played so far in 2004 this is one of the three that really impressed me (the other two are Ticket To Ride and Power Grid.)

Set-collecting card game with a city building theme. The game consists of several rounds comprising of four turns. On each turn a number of cards (up to eight) are revealed from four decks (workers, buildings, aristocrats, and upgrades to previously acquired cards from the three other decks). Players take it in turns to purchase the buildings and add them to their tableau, and these in turn provide benefits throughout the remainder of the game e.g. workers produce money to purchase more cards, buildings award victory points, and aristocrats a combination of the two. Points are also awarded at the end of the game for having a variety of different aristocrats in the player's city. 'Saint Petersburg' is a pleasingly simple and streamlined game to play in comparison to other similar set-collection and efficiently obtaining victory points games, but it maintains a strategic depth to the gameplay and this ensures that it deserves to be played repeatedly by fans of this style of game.

I thought this game would be more than it is for some reason.  I like it and have only played it 2 players.  I feel it lacks tension especially if the blow out starts happening.  That's not fun to experience from either side.  I do want to get it to the table with 4.  I think having the cards a little more scarce is going to even things out. 

update : A couple more plays in and I see the subtlety of this game.  You must match your opponent move for move to some degree until you can incrementally make a bright play that will get you ahead.  It's definitely micromanaging and being aware of your opponents economy.  I understand the planning ahead needed to make full use of your meager money.  Holding cards is key to make displacement moves that are not obvious on the visual playing field.   Knowing the cards and the power of upgrades is vital and this is learned with further plays.

update : Just had a very good game where the scores were close. It was nice to take a break, and come back and realize it was a very fun game.  This game has improved considerably with more plays.

Agh! I am horrible at this game.  The New Society cards bring some nice abilities to the play.  Doesn't help me though.

Well this turned out not be as much fun playing about it having read about it. It's pretty innovative to me; and I was definitely looking forward to the valuation system as well as the upgrade thing. It took 3 of us 1 1/2 hours which is too long for a card game, but this time would probably decrease with repeated play. Ultimately I dont think it's rating will change for me as the strategies begin to get familiar: it seems that you've got to time you income generating machine for just the right time. Get those buildings and people and up to stuff just before the game ends and your money machine will but in high gear at the right moment. If you mistime it, the game ends before you get them into high gear. I get the feeling this will become rather obvious with repeated play. Interesting game though

After my first game I was sure I have to look at nobles for winnig. The second game gave me a different feedback. I think that you can follow often a different strategy, it depend by what cards are drawn. A pleasant game, but sometimes it seems that you have to play in one way without any choice.

Early rounds are to scripted.  If you don't follow the script, you don't win.  Once all players know the early script, a decent game emerges.

Update:  After many plays, I have come to the conclusion that In a 2 player game, the person who picks the first aristocrat should win 98% of the time, with competent play.  This kinda removes any enjoyment that I could get from playing.

A decent card/set collection game. Nothing epic or amazing, but given its age, what it does, it does well.

I often describe this as Dominion without all the shuffling and that really is how I feel about it. It also has some mild randomness which avoids the issue in Dominion of 'this is how I'm going to play the game, let's see if my engine works (in 40 minutes or so).'

Pro:A grafikája zseniális, a kis lapok nagyszerűek, a játék ötletes, magával ragadó. 
Small cards and their graphics are very magnificant, the game is smart.

Kontra:A játék vége felé a szerencse majdhogynem döntően meghatározó lesz, hiszen a játék végén már mindenkinek sok pénze van és a jó kártyákat mindig az éppen kezdő játékos biztosaan megkaparintja. Persze lehet variálni azzal, hogy megvenni több dolgot az előző körből és így az új körben több lap kerül felcsapásra és elképzelhető, hogy jut egy jó káértya az utolsónak választó játékosnak is, de azért ez már szerencse és semmi más.

The luck is dominant at end of game, because every player has lot of money and the start player of a round takes the best cards.

There`re 4 types phases in each round. In the first you can hire workesr - they will give you money. In the second you can buy buildings - they give mainly points. In the third you can get aristocrates. They give some money, sometimes points. They are more expensive than workers and buildings, but gives you many bonus points at the end of the game. Usually you can`t wi without a majority in the aristocrats. That`s no good. The building stategy is not so strong. The New Society expansion changes it. In the forth phase you can get upgrade cards (for all 3 types of cards).

You don1t have maoney to get every card, that you want, but you can take up to 3 cards on your hand and pay for them later. When you have a card, you pay 1 less if you buy the same card again. You buy also 1 less if the card is from the previous round.

You must see how many cards will come in the next phase (when you will be forth and there will be only 3 cards, maybe its good to buy a card, then there will be 4 cards, specially when this are aristocrates.

I like the game, but don1t like that the aristocrates are so strong.

Our initial plays of this fine game left me feeling absolutely clueless. In fact I despaired so much I logged on to the strategy section  of the game page here on BGG.

Once I had absorbed some of the lessons to be learned I proceeded to kick my dear wife from here and to Aarhus. A pattern was established in which I would continue to do so, though she slow but steadily was catching on to me.

The game itself is very dry. You buy workers who earn you cash. Buildings who earn cash and/ or victory points or sometimes special abilities. Advisors who again earn cash and/ or victory points and finally special cards that are upgrades of workers/ buildings/ advisors.

You rinse and repeat. The game scores or pay out after each specific phase (ie workers/ buildings/ advisors). It is a balancing act of getting the right workers plus cash so you can still get the right buildings and advisors, not to mention the special buildings later on.

Overspending in the worker phase may mean you miss out on some cool buildings or in particular advisors in later phases.

The neat trick is to get the advisors that will get you points and cash. The earlier in the game you get them, the sooner they will earn themselves and start providing a surplus.

Game end follows when one of the stacks (workers etc.) are depleted. There are more specifics such as card rows, cards being moved down and becoming cheaper etc. but you get the gist...

Returning to the initial comments, then we come to a state where I feel I have done all there is and where there are no challenges to be had. It may be group-think (I only play against my wife), it may be that different players mean different strategies or making it harder to execute said strategies.

I like the game, I can see past the drab colours and see there is a good game here - which is also reflected in the score - even if we have sold the game.

I thought this game looked overly simplistic the first time I played it, but it turns out that it has a surprising amount of strategic depth for a game with so few rules.  It's easy to learn, quick to play, and lots of fun.  The only mechanic about it that really lowers the score for me is that buildings don't quite seem to be worth buying, and the game often devolves into a race to see who can collect the most orange cards for the big bonus at the end.

One play so far and it was a 2 player game. I like the different things you can do in this game. Get cards and play or hold them, don't get cards and try to keep certain other types of cards from hitting the board during a specific round. It seems like many different play styles can go along with game and still have a chance at winning. After a four player game my rating went up. Money is so much tighter and trying to get the cards you want is a lot harder. Yet the game remains light and enjoyable and doesn't feel overly competitive.

A good game that has grown on me. The biggest issue I have with the game is that there seems to always be one optimal move - miss that move and you might be out of the game.

A tactical puzzle. Each turn you have to question if you have enough money to buy what you want. You are always $1 short, no matter how good you are at doing "st pete" math. A great game.

Update 9/2015:
Not interesting enough after many repeated plays.  Games are very similar.  There is enough luck to pull a good card at a random time, but that's not enough for me to be interested.  It's a good game, but there are better money management / economic snowball games out there.

Interesting mechanics, but balance seems a bit off and options (at least ones that make sense) seem limited.

Rating 10: "Always want to play and expect this will never change."

This has now achieved "classic" status for me. After trying out the latest "flavor of the month" games, we know we can always return to Saint Petersburg to provide a great gaming experience. 

The first few times I played this I wasn't so impressed. When I pulled it out a few months later, I started to enjoy it a lot more. 

Great lighter, low-confrontation eurogame. It's perfect for newbie gamers who aren't put off by the unique art and theme. Also great for more experienced gamers.

St. Petersburg is a light, refreshing breeze compared to the many rule-laden games that generate the same level of satisfaction.

There's nothing about this charmless game that urges me to try it again.  I didn't have a bad time playing it; it just didn't inspire any kind of emotional response at all.  It's about as enjoyable as playing a Sudoku puzzle.  

I probably would have once appreciated it, but I've become so tired of dry, lifeless Euros that are exercises in efficiency, inhibit player interaction, and simply tweak the same dreary aesthetics and themes.  I like games to have some pizazz or delight me with something I haven't seen before or allow me to crush my enemies.  This game has none of that.

UPDATE: I should try this one again sometime.

Drafting from an ever changing line of cards to build an economic/point-producing engine is really interesting, but other games scratch the itch better (including Through the Ages, Dominion, Le Havre, and Race for the Galaxy). Still a solid game, though.

RATING: 5.5
A deep game that also manages to be very simple at the same time.  I enjoy multiple paths to victory games, and there are all kinds of ways to go about winning St. Pete.  I can see that, although the appearance of cards changes every time, the game could get a little programmed.  At its essence, it is a worker placement/economic engine game--place your resources here, get this in return, all the while building your cache--that manages to toss money management to the wind (money is only tight if you plan poorly, otherwise it is easy to come by).  

2 PLAYER:  The biggest problem with Saint Pete 2P is that a player can be completely controlled by how the cards come out.  The game really tricks you into thinking it is high strategy, but, in the end, and after several plays, it becomes apparent that the player with the best strategy does not always win--the player who gets the best cards falling to him does.  The players have less control over the game than the game has over them.  I have a hard time with games that masquerade as something they are not.  This is reflected in my rating.

I get the feeling that the entire game is designed to save enough money to buy as many workers as are available, and THEN spend anything leftover.

However, upon playing the 4 player game, you soon realize the game is over far to soon for this to pay off.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game but it seems to have a bad runaway leader problem. I feel like with enough analysis you could figure out who is going to win after just the first one or two rounds. This is a snowball engine-building game and if somebody gets a good combination of money-making cards early on, it can be seemingly impossible for anybody else to come close. The person with the most money can keep buying the most expensive cards, which in turn give them more and more money and points.

Update: The second edition is a big improvement. I still had some issues with the gameplay, but the addition of the market helps fix some of the games' issues.

Sold.

This game is becoming a favourite of mine. The basics of building a money economy which you then turn into VPs later in the game works well. There is certainly quite a bit of luck with how the cards are drawn, but I think the key to winning is to figure out what the best opportunities are at any given time. Balancing the cards available at any given time, with possible opportunities in the future seems to be quite a delicate act that I have yet to master.

An enjoyable game, but I'm not sure that it doesn't get same-y after a dozen plays or so.

This is an elegantly balanced/designed game of trying to get the money/buildings/people you need through a very tight economy.  A lot of fun even if the overall theme and feel is a little dry.  I really need to play this again.

RATING: 7
Really botched the rules of this the first time out.  Once I figured it out it played nicely, and it seems like a good thing to pull out when I'm gaming with one other person and feel like something with just slightly more "game" to it.  I'm avoiding it on BSW to savor the newness of it.  One of the first five games I got after visiting BGG, but one of the most recent to get opened and played.  In all honesty, the initial rating is based on my experience with poorly-explained rules, so we'll see what happens with this one.

I've always had a blast playing this game.  Some players do seem to dominate by sticking to a very tight strategy of workers early, some buildings, and lots and lots of 'crats.  If you do fall behind early, it's sometimes hard to catch up, since the gameplay always keeps you at the poverty line.

RATING: 8
Interesting game that has more depth to it that you'd think at first.

There is some nice hand management and long term planning involved and it has somewhat of an addictive quality.

It should play in under an hour too which is just about right.

I personally like this pre-renaissance looking art style in most games, while most people hate it I like the charm of it.

This game continues to really amaze me, I don't know why I want to keep playing it, but I do.  I'd never turn down a play but the vast majority of people I've seen it introduced to it have really disliked it.  It is extremely divisive.

Interesting as a mathematical/optimization exercise maybe, but doesn't grab me as a game.  Most of the choices are obvious and there is really only a single viable strategy (nobles).  This leads to a very mechanical course of play, and there is nothing in the game to cause any meaningful player interaction.  One of the few games that I'd rather play against the computer -- there is enough here to sustain a 5 minute autopilot game, but not a half hour sitting at a table with people.  St. Petersburg is so far inferior to another economic/city building card game -- San Juan -- that I don't know why I'd ever choose to play this.

Okay, so its happened.  A game I have no desire to play because its been ruined for me by the geek.  I see the imbalance of the possible strategies and wish it was playtested more.  I wish it was a game with multiple paths, instead of who did the single path the best.  Sigh.  Gotta take the good with the bad.  It makes me sad, this game could be phenominal if multiple paths existed.  so close... so this ranking could be a knee jerk reaction.  If played super quick this is a decent filler, but players tend to think they have agonizing decisions(they don't) and it turns it into a much longer game than it should be.  If you really enjoy San Juan, I could recommend this, if you can't stand San Juan then stay the heck away.  They don't play the same.... but they have the same flaws.

TRADED AWAY (2/2/08) --- This game has steadily dropped in rating for me.  It started at 9 after the first playing, but after a couple more plays dropped to an 8.  After staying at an 8 for a while, it has since dropped to a 6.  I guess this is because every game of St. Petersburg is very similar to every other game of St. Petersburg.  Buy lots of workers, buy a few buildings, buy as many different aristocrats as possible.  Some of the cards are unique and interesting, but most are almost identical with only slight differences.  I think this is a well designed game, that is great fun the first few times you play it.  But it simply doesn't stand up to numerous repeated plays.

Downgraded a bit after many plays, because it's a bit mechanical in play. It's got a lot of luck, of course -- it's a card game -- but there's a fair bit of room for skill and analysis. The 4-player game plays faster than the rules say they will, frequently only 5 or 6 rounds. It seems though that, among reasonably skilled players, the game is usually decided by luck more than the fine gradings of skill.

This is a great economic game. It is simple, but behind it there is a lot of strategy.  It is always underrated by people simply because in my opinion there is not enough excitement. It can be a dry game but it all depends on the people that play it. A classic!

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9217/saint-petersburg]Saint Petersburg[/url] was a game I played, so far, only on Yucata, so all of the meta-game that happens around the table is lost.

As is, the game has many interesting decisions to be made throughout. I'm still not 100% sure of how the phases of the game works, but Yucata deals with this matter for me. What I do know is that the flow of the game is well made and makes sense: with the works you get money, to pay for buildings and to sustain the nobles and the get people to do more refine work.

Every type of cards (workers, buildings and nobles) has its own phase, when you collect money and VPs for the next phase - this is something I liked quite a bit.

I can't say much about the time of a game (going by Yucata I will say: around ten days!). I can say that the game scales well, but has no catch-up mechanics, so once someone has a good money-VPs machine working, say goodbye.

The price for [b]Saint Petersburg[/b] is somewhat high, and has a on-off relation with my wishlist. So far, it will stay off, but I do want to play some more of it, so I hope I can convince someone in my game group to buy it! Will see.

Saint Petersburg is an innovative and fun game that marries strategic economic management with careful planning. At its heart is the buying of workers that make money, that allow to buy buildings, which earn victory points, aristocrats, which do a little of both and also score bonus points at the end of the game for the more you have, and trading cards that allow to upgrade existing cards. I have read some criticism on the balance of power of some cards from the base game, which I understand leads to some unforgiving experience if you make poor decision early on. Therefore my one tip for this game is never spunk all your money at the end of each round so you have money to buy workers with in the following round! However, on the flip side, don't get left behind on VP in the building round. Love the scenario and artwork. Certainly one of our favourites in the collection.

I suspect this needs more plays to learn the card combos and progressions that are likely to show up so you know what to aim for.  I found it very dry, and a bit dull.

I "get" the game a bit more now, but I'm wondering how much it comes down to aristocrat luck. The bulk of my plays have been 2-player, and in all but one case (I believe), the first player has won. The Observatory might be a bit too good since the aristocrat bonus is so high, but I'm not sure.

A very good engine to VPs game, where positional drafting of cards, costs, and a small hand size is used to get many of the same effects that auctions would provide, but for much less time and complexity.

I rate the base game a 7.5, but I never play it by itself. 

I always play St.P with my New Society expansion (and would rate the two of them together a combined 9.5, if I rated my own games).

Got this game in December, and have played it perhaps 20 times since then.  I feel that strategies aren't nearly as "fixed" as some say--you figure out early on that you can't ignore aristocrats, but the relative weight you give them depends on what comes out.  Great middleweight.

Many games later, and it feels a bit too rote and mathy for me. Great game, just not top tier for me. Wish an early building strategy was more viable.

Based on 2 and 3-player ratings. I think this game has a lot of potential, but does not really shine or innovate. Old mechanics and really lousy theme. St. Peterburg? Come on. But still enjoyed it and may be a lot better with multiple players

092312: Certainly better with multiple players. Money remains tight as ever. Not really that bad of a game. Would certainly play it more often. Upgrade ratings to a 7. 

With more plays, this game has improved tremendously. The strategy for two player differs from three or four. Aristocrat rush is much harder and really dependent on luck of the draw.

Played at Origins 04.  I had mentally dismissed this game as just a boring card game with money handling.  Something about it turned me off.  Good thing I didn't listen to my preconceived notions at Origins when offered a game, because I would have missed out.  The game felt light and fun, and I saw a hint of the reported depth of the game.  I look forward to delving deeper when my order comes in.

P.S.  My order came in, and we played a two player game.  It was much more intense than I remember from the Origins game, but really good, too.  My head hurts a little.

P.P.S.  I am unable to get get anything other than an aristocrat strategy to work, I am beginning to burn out.  It might also be because of the repeated butt whooping I've been getting, but I'm not sure.

This seems to be a game that, somewhat like Attika, goes through an initial period of great interest and then becomes somewhat rote as you "figure the game out."  Most people think it's best with 2p, where nobles diversity isn't the only path to victory (since both players can hit 10)- I agree with them.  However, I've had the misfortune to rarely play this 2p.

(c.f. my comments on Coloretto and Hacienda about the overdone and powerful cleverness that is triangular scoring.)

Rating after initial play. This is an intriguing Euro. I like the resource management aspect of the game but can't really imagine this as a gateway/intro game. While its simple enough, it can be brutally unforgiving. You HAVE to get your rubles generating very quickly. If you don't then it is nigh impossible to catch up with players who do get the cash flow going. Sure, you might be in the game but you'll be watching from the sidelines during the last few rounds. I'm sure with a bit of experience this game can be quite the driving force, but I'll have to see that for myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Good game, with a decent amount of stuff to chew on packed into a not-too-long play time.  One must learn one's way around the different decks.  I would say that bettering your own score involves some strategy and planning (and sometimes a lot of mental arithmetic), while blocking opponents is mainly tactical.  The theme doesn't have much to do with the mechanics, but the art is good and provides a decent level of atmosphere.

2016/10: after 6 plays this year, it has become obvious that SP is a solid game, but the design hasn't aged well. The strategy is too linear, the runaway leader is a big problem and demotivate both losing and winning players, because for the loser it doesn't matter anymore, and for the winner there's no more need to stay sharp and make [i]the best[/i] of it. Decided to trade or sell soon.

2009/10: Two plays of the base-game were quite enjoyable, unfortunately lasted a bit too long. Decided that the new expansion is not needed.

Gain fame by building 18th century Saint Petersburg - players develop an economy by acquiring workers, buildings, and attracting aristocrats with the goal of scoring the most "fame" points. Takes a game or two to get a handle on the strategy and how the cards interact but the game is no harder than "gateway" in difficulty level, though I think it's best suited as a "next step" game. There are been criticisms about the art but I quite like the thematic Russian graphics. Components and cards are excellent quality. Solid game that shows its depths through repeated plays. Works well but has a different flavor at 2, 3, or 4 players (I suggest taking out the Pubs at 2P though, because there's a lot of money to go around and they break the game, especially if one player can horde them all).

A 4th play showed even less redeeming quality than I expected - really the only neat thing about this game is the distinct phases and how new cards come out during them; nothing more.  It seems like it should be best with 3, but the way the phases work for 3 players is awkward.

The first phase feels fairly pointless, as it is essentially a random draw for who gets a better deal on income generation.  The second phase is then flush with buildings that nobody wants because they are underpowered, but people may grab some simply so they have the option of getting an aristocrat.  

Aristocrats are clearly stronger in general than buildings, considering their benefit during the game is fairly comparable yet they score insanely at the end.  The end of the game also feels very silly, where you have a final chance to buy upgrades, and if there are no aristocrats there is no reason to buy anything.  The Observatory is, in general, extremely strong as well.

So overall, the game has clear balance issues, and almost nothing clever enough to make up for its significant flaws.

I like the mix of card management and money management in this game. Not a boardgame really but a card game with a board as a visual aid. The theme is arbitrary. You don't really feel like you are building anything. Competitive but not intensely player interactive.
Despite the heft of the decisions that players must make, St. Pete feels relaxing to me. Not a real brain burner
but that's fine. The game's graphic style is appealing and unique.

Rating based on one play.  Not thrilling, but not bad.  Surefire appeal for optimizers and economy junkies.  Seems to be well-engineered, but left me a little cold after one play.  It seems like the type of game which is going to reveal its genius after about ten plays, but that might be about seven too many for a game like this.  As a flippant personal observation, I strongly dislike the art style in this game.  I understand that it's trying to evoke period artwork, but the flat, almost childish imagery really turns me off.

I feel this game has two big flaws.
1. it only really works as a 4 player game (i know some people love it two player but  I feel your card choices become less important.)UPDATE: i found out i've been playing the 2,3,and 5 player rules wrong i will have to reevaluate 
2. a couple of the cards have balance issues

Despite this i love the game. To win this game you have to understand not only what to buy but when to buy it. You are forced to make some tough choices and It always seems like you are 2 dollars short of an optimal turn. I have played the game over and over and i still look back and see play mistakes and the game still has things to teach me. It is important to note that the game is not  deterministic , and great play will not always give you victory but in the end skill will win you most games.

I was destroyed by a better plyaer but they did get the mistress(?) in the first round. Someone watching us said they usually shuffle her back in when she comes up in the first round because usually the player that gets it wins. I'll be looking to grab that card the next time I play.

i was very impressed when i first played this on bsw, but after just a couple plays i've lost interest. what at first appears to be a game very similar to PR in feel turns out to be a very mechanistic game that seems to play itself and is very unforgiving once one player gets ahead. i decided not to buy this one after all.

Saint Petersburg is a card game in which you acquire workers for income, build buildings for fame, and attract aristocrats to your city in order to gain the most fame at the end of the game.

Card game deals with 'gracious living along the river Neva': the baroque palaces, wide boulevards, and imposing bridges of St. Petersburg. On May 16th, 1703, Czar Peter laid the cornerstone for the first building. Quickly, glorious buildings were added, always being expanded, so that Nobility (as well as victory-bringing Fame Points) may want to move in. But to accomplish this, one needs merchants who can bankroll the necessary Rubles, or the glory is over. The competition isn't sleeping either, and can sometimes steal a desired card right out from under your nose.

After 2 games I'm a bit infatuated with Pete.  I wish it played a little faster.  A great game to practice your Russian accent during!

UPDATE: after 3-4 more plays, I'm beginning to see why the game gets criticized.  Run-away leader problems seem to abound.

This is probably the one "engine" game that gamers could use to introduce the concept to folks just getting into the hobby.  It's fairly straightforward, and new players can have a reasonably good first experience with the game, so long as the experienced players offer up suggestions and tips during the course of the game.  That I've played it so many times, and still want to play it again, speaks volumes to how well the game holds up.

A nice city building game without any direct confrontations between players. The rules could have been a bit clearer on some issues, but overall a very good concept and game. If optimization and constant points counting is your thing, then this is your game. It's probably true that the best optimizer should win this game. There is of course an element of chance in the game but if you don't organize and play your cards right then you won't win!

A fine game for accountants.  No long-term (or even middle-term) appeal though: no must-play-again-soon buzz.

Optimal strategy: Get income early to get aristocrats.  Then Win.. unless the cards come out in a bad order, because its likely everyone at the table is playing the exact same strategy.  The only reason people buy buildings is so that they have a shot at getting an aristocrat on the next go-around.  If buildings were a more viable strategy, this game would be much better.  So, not so great because of obvious optimal strategies.

This is a resource management game that feels quirky due to the way every round progresses through different phases, which impact which resources the players are able to obtain at certain times.

Card draft and set collection game representing the early development of Saint Petersburg. Draft a card to your hand or pay to put it in play. Workers, buildings, aristocrats, and upgrades earn money, points, or special abilities. It starts out deceptively simple. After a few rounds the strategy gets big. Pretty dry and mathy. Nubes have disadvantage.

The game has several interesting things going on but it feels to scripted both at the beginning and the end. 

For example, there is zero reason not to buy gren cards in the first 3-4 rounds and there is no reason not to buy nobles in the last round or two. 

I like having interesting choices every round, my choices feel far to scripted (and some might say luck dependant in the early/late rounds) for me to really give it a big thumbs up.

I really liked this when it first came out. It is an semi-engine building game. Buy this, so that you can do that, so you can get money, so you can get Victory points. The randomness of the setup is good but being in 4th position has to make it hard to win. There have been some systems on what to purchase developed. That make it less desirable for me. However, if you play against people that don't read those things, it can be a fun game.

Played lots of time (both face-to-face and on BSW, with 2 to 4 players). A very nice game of income-building, which works well whatever the number of players. There is some randomness in it due to the luck of the draw, but its effects are not too big for my tastes. I am also fine with the nobles as they are - powerful, but not unreasonably so. I used to rate it a bit higher, but got burned out of it. Still, it remains a very good game (and I like the illustrations a lot).

Someone from a board game cafe taught us St Petersburg about 7 years ago when we first started gaming. Maybe he didn't teach well as we did not enjoy this game at all. Fast forward 7 years later, we decided to give St Petersburg another chance as my bro/ best gaming buddy, Jerry loves this game a lot. He taught us St Petersburg again. Perhaps we are more experienced in gaming now and are able to appreciate the gameplay better. Yes we definitely enjoy it a lot more now. Morale of the story, the person who teaches the game often play a very crucial and important role in whether the players will like the game or not. Don't you agree?

As others have noted, this is a card game with a board thrown in.  After a couple of plays, this is a good resource management game with 4 players and a pretty lousy game with 2 or 3 players.

Don't get me wrong, with 4 players, this is a tense, enjoyable game that doesn't drag and is easy to engage newcomers... but it doesn't belong in the top 100.

This game is showing it's age but is still a classic!  I enjoy the art style and card play a lot.  Deciding if you want to go for cards that give you income or points is always a tough decision.  As a long term planner, I usually go for generating money but this is one of those game where you can go for a powerful point scoring card in the beginning of the game and still win against a money generating player.  The set collection aspect is wonderfully implemented and adds another layer of depth to this great, classic design.  There is a lot of strategy to be found and this makes an excellent spouse game.

Fairly straightforward, mathematically calculable decisions and quick, simple gameplay. I can see why people grow frustrated with initial draws for cash. At first, I felt the game suffered greatly from "rich get richer" problems. I can see that there are some opportunities to block the play of others by putting cards into your hand, but there seems to be no way to "catch up" once you're behind. I'd play again with 2 players, but it really feeled awkward and clumsy as a 4 player game.

I really like how the resource management of this game is set up.  The left over cards from one round/turn reducing the new options in the next round/turn made for some quite intersting decisions.  Upgrading your followers/buildings increased the choices nicely.  With the expansion added this is my favorite medium weight economic engine Euro.

Clever card drafting mechanic, combined with the 4 different phases each round cycles through, made St. Petersburg a relatively unique play experience.  I was told afterwards that the game is broken and too luck-ridden, which very well may be the case, but I like it enough to not it let me bother me much.

I've mostly lost interest in playing this.  It's clever, but ultimately, what's the point?

I originally had a higher opinion of this game.  The 4 player game takes too long for what the game is imo.

I thought this was really a interesting and tactical game. Never seen it in a store before, until a couple of weeks ago. Could pick it up for half the price, and so we did. Started to set-up the game and read the rules. Easy game to explain, and within 15 minutes we were playing. Didn’t know what was wise to do at the beginning. Money is scarce in the beginning of the game, and you should find a way to generate income. But also points are welcome. And the aristocrats will generate small income and/or some points, but they can give lots of points at the final counting of points. Decisions, decisions, decisions. But….

After playing two or three rounds, it becomes clear what would be wise to do. The game becomes a bit of automatic playing. There are no more surprises. It’s a nice game for every now and they, but the re-playability-factor of this game isn’t too high.

Multi player solitaire. No interaction between the players . Playing it with 3 friends or alone against a computer wouldn't make any difference. Also: link between game mechanics and theme is not evident.

Sencillo pero difÃ­cil de dominar, familiar y al mismo tiempo con posibilidad de mÃºltiples estrategias. Un juego indispensable para cualquier nÃºmero de jugadores entre 2 y 4.

I'm not sure why I like this game so much. It's just such a CLEAN design. And unique. I love the differences between the card types, and details like the way the workers pay out in multiples of 3. I don't even mind the cheap-looking art.

I can't get enough of this game.  The careful management of your funds; the ability to completely shoot yourself in the foot, but only have to suffer for the short duration of the game before trying again, because you usually know what you did wrong.  Yet it's so easy to be tempted to err again.  This game is brilliant!  For the longest time, I'd only played it on BrettSpielWelt, and feared that keeping track of everyone's income and all that could be an accounting nightmare which could really detract from the fun.  In reality, the biggest thing missing is the cool snippets of Russian music to prompt the players.  :^)

Discovered it a few years ago by accident at a garage sale sealed and new. Had no idea of it and was very positively surprised. In regards of simplicity and easy to teach rules, enough tactics and interaction in addition to good luck this made it to my all time top 10.

After 5+ Plays: Quickly becoming one of my favorites.  

After 10+ Plays: An economic engine game that is boiled down to its very essence, and teeters on the edge of being too simple.  I like it a lot though and am pleasantly surprised, in light of its simplicity, that it has held up after repeated plays.

After 15+ Plays: Lowering rating from 9 to 8.  Considering how little strategic variety there is, I'm surprised how many plays this game kept my interest for.  Certainly still enjoyable for an occasional play, but it's past its prime.

When I saw this game first time I thought it was crap.
After a few games I radically change my thoughts: the graphic is a choice and I like it.
The game is well balanced and deep.

Why even bother getting together to game if you're not even going to interact with each other in the game itself?

Got addicted to the westparkgamers free computer edition. Great *card* game ;) More strategy involved then you recognize at first glance. A game that you can't pass on for that price. And btw: cool thematic fitting artwork!

Карточная игра, в которой мы покупаем свои активы с "рынка карт". До предела оголённая механика, присутствующая в некоторых других играх. Отлично сбалансирована, не так просто просчитывается.

Минусы - фан есть лишь в соревновании. Через несколько игр понимаешь, что при малом числе игроков рулят синие карты и деньги, а при большом - дворяне. Зачастую выбор карты для покупки определяется тем, что есть, хотя эффект трёх "И" ("игра играет игроком") закамуфлирован.

A fun card-based victory point and money engine building game by using deck building and card drafting mechanics. On each round you can purchase workers to make more money, use the money that's produced to buy buildings and aristocrats (each worth victory points and/or money), and if you have any left over, buy upgrades. Rinse, repeat. I'm not really too wild about the starting player cards (they simply serve no other purpose), cumbersome scoring track (it takes a couple of plays to figure them out), and player pieces (they don't seem to fit on the scoring track itself), player pieces (why do you need two of each color?). There are possible runaway leader problems if you don't snag a couple of critical cards. The downside is that the path to victory always appears to be the same, based on catch-up really; indebt yourself reserving expensive cards, then sling-shot back to the top after paying for them.

Too little player interaction in this one, feels very much like solitaire. The mechanism is allright, but just not a game for me. Feels like something is missing.

Adquiere trabajadores para generar ingresos, construye edificios para obtener fama y atraen aristócratas a la ciudad para obtener la mayor fama al final del juego. El dinero es muuuy escazo.

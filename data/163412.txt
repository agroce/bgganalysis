[i]tl;dr - Don't assume too much strategy, but appreciate the light decision space and tetris-like stacking that Patchwork gives you. When you can whip through three games in about fifteen minutes, you know you've found a good two-player filler.[/i]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Patchwork is a little abstract that has rightly gotten a lot of buzz. Approached as a light, fun, game, I can't think of many flaws -- I really enjoy playing this one with my wife and we love the flow of building your quilt, acquiring buttons, and tetris-ing everything together. 

However, I can see how many gamers wouldn't like this one. There's a lot of randomness in how the pieces are shuffled out and sometimes you are forced to pass just because of bad tile distribution, giving your opponent a huge advantage. All things considered, I'll probably end up playing this one more casually than competitively, but be aware that it can be unbalanced (as any two-player game) in competitive play. 

For me, this just doesn't flip my lid, which is a reversal of where I was at several plays ago. I would have said that the luck factor is fine, there's mitigation, that it's still pleasant to build your quilts -- nope, my wife and I are far too competitive for this one, and it won't be sticking in my collection.

Delightful abstract strategy game. It takes 2 minutes to learn and plays quickly, which I like in my abstract games. Although it is mechanically quite different, it has a very similar feel to Lanterns. It feels like a mini euro rather than a more competitive abstract like Hive, which makes it a good couples game that is unlikely to leave a whole lot of hard feelings.

Very enjoyable yet straight forward two player race game. There are at least 3 lines of strategy here: collecting tiles for button income, collecting tiles for space coverage and managing your time on the track. It adds up to a highly engaging puzzle between opponents. The theme is beautifully rendered as well which only increases enjoyment. Lovely piece of work!

Absolutely brilliant. I did not expect this from Uwe who I almost considered a lost designer of late. Lost to making games too convoluted and heavy. 

Patchwork is a nice mix of planning a step or two ahead, blocking your opponent and seizing the opportunities. It offers trade-offs between getting the best tile for you and denying your opponent something. And again (like in Le Havre) your victory points are your resources.

Best of all, this plays in 20 minutes and still manages to be a satisfying experience.

Neat 2-player game, lots of decisions and replay value, but I just didn't really have fun.  I appreciate that you can spend a lot of time effectively planning your turns and moves and board, or you can simply do stuff and see what happens, but there just wasn't anything that made me say "That was fun".

That aside, I've played the app a lot because it's a great way to burn a lot of downtime for the price, however it's not a game I would want to own and play with others.

After the app updated to make AI competitive, I don't enjoy the game.  I like playing for fun (going for combos or tons of buttons or a full quilt) but doing so is not competitive and I lost every single game.  I can win a couple games now, but the strategies you need to use feel like parking the bus in football, where they are effective but no one enjoys it.

First and foremost: this game is fantastic. Easily one of the best gateway games of all time, and still a great casual option for downtime after a day of work.

I wish the game took up a bit less space as that would allow it to be played at a restaurant or at work, but I understand that other concessions would have to be made and don't really fault it for that. More of "in a perfect world" sort of comment.

What I do find unacceptable, however, is that sometimes the pieces do not fit together, and you have to occasionally jam one piece so that it "slots" into another.

RATING: 7
Patchwork is a nice two player game. It's quick to explain, easy to play and it has all the qualities of a well designed game... but it's also barely OK, at least in my opinion.

Don't get me wrong, playing Patchwork is actually fairly enjoyable, especially when you are in the mood to play something "relaxing", so to speak. It allows you to play an engine building game without a huge number crunching and the complexity typical of these kinds of games. Still it's also very repetitive and it gets old pretty quickly, therefore I really don't understand how this game got to number 38 on the general ranking on BGG. I don't usually care so much about these sort of things, but I really believe that this game is overrated by the community here.

While there's nothing really wrong with Patchwork as a design, there are much better 2-player games on the market right now. It's a good way to spend 20 minutes with your significant other, but not good enough to be so highly regarded. Just an alright game.

1st Play: played with my 6 year old. Very appealing relaxing game with a nice flow. Not over complicated and a nice tableau building aspect. Not a super deep game but pleasant.

2nd Play: Played with wife, my scores were much better than last time, and she did decently well.  The game limits choices nicely but allows for some strategic planning when it's not your turn.  The board is nice to look at and the game plays in a short timeframe.  Pimping with real buttons is easy and improves the currency as well.

In my first two games, I lost irritatingly both times on leaving too many empty squares. I'm too fixated on not leaving any gaps!

A light game with plenty of strategic depth, and honestly it can have some pretty cutthroat opportunities if you wish to go that route.

A definite hit for us, as it offers a quick play time with a varying depth of strategy. This is the only game we own that we have played back to back, and on every occasion it has come out, it has been played back to back.

The payoff of buttons throughout the game is a little moment of joy as you see how well your board is coming along. Every game I've played so far feels like there is no way I can complete my quilt by the end of the game, but I always manage to get within a few spaces. What is also fun is that our scores improve every time we play. We're not sure what we're doing differently, but we're getting significantly better somehow!

Awesome game.

RATING: 8.1
This is a cool little game.  It's so easy to learn and play.  Every time I play, I want to try a different strategy.  The only draw back is how overly-balanced the game is, which might be a plus for many people. There is no way at all to get to an early lead.  Even if you do something really smart and get the right piece for the right price at the right time, you will still be opening up your opponent to gain something as well.  In fact, it kind of feels like one player could do almost nothing and it would still be a close game,  The counterbalance to this is how you construct your quilt board.  The one thing that matters more than anything else is fitting the fabric pieces well on your board.  This also means that very often it will be the person who gets the 7 bonus points for making a 7x7 grid who wins, but not necessarily.  Making a 7x7 grid costs you the opportunity to use larger pieces at the end of the game which are needed to cover large areas on your board.  Anyway, the games are ALWAYS close.  It doesn't matter how much "better" or "worse" you play, the game is going to be close.  There are too many balances in the scoring for one person to just slaughter another.  Nevertheless, this is a very fun very replayable game that can be found for a reasonable price.

Patchwork is definitely a cute little 2-player game and would be easy to bring to any family member, even ones who don't game.

As a rule, I don't enjoy abstract strategy games, so I didn't buy this one for me. My partner had a significantly better time with it than I did. Make no mistake, past the cute exterior, this is still a typical abstract game of trying to make moves and countermoves. The board tile arranging is nice but unless you both A. Run out of space for new tiles and B. Lose because of that fact, it never comes into play during that actual game. It's just sort of a thing to entertain you while you check for the next tile you need.

There are a lot of different unilateral and mixed strategies to the game but the key difference is the starting tile placement. If you take tile placement too lightly, you can find yourself in a horrible position for the entire game. Once a player begins to dominate tile selection (due to starting position), it's ridiculously difficult to stop them without tanking your economy, which they might be able to recover from while you grab up buttons.

Due to the abstract nature and the critical component of player snowballing, I can't really rate this game too high. It's good to kill a half hour with my partner before moving on to something where the choices feel more meaningful.

In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.

RATING: 5.5
This game feels a bit, to me, like Jaipur and Pandemic where the game has been so meticulously playtested and balanced, that you could basically slot in any two random people and get the same end results every time. They give the impression of making choices, but it all comes back to where the designer wants you by the end. There's no way to go massively over on your board, nor under. What you miss in squares is made up for in buttons, and whether you go heavy on buttons or on large tiles, you still end up with a similar score as your opponent.

I can imagine that, after a lot of plays, you could really start to play by looking ahead and really trying to kneecap your opponent at the market, but even there, I feel like the game is so balanced that it probably won't accomplish much in the end run.

I like that it has easy to learn rules, and I certainly wouldn't mind playing the game many dozens of times, but the overly-balanced nature of it makes it feel like my involvement is unnecessary, and so I may as well play something else.

Bought this game because of all the hyped up reviews. Definitely lived up to those. Very very fun, easy, and exciting to play. My wife and I played this 3 times in a row after we first opened it. I won twice and then she won. First few times it seems hard to get positive points and that's only happened once to me, but I am so ready for another go to try and make it happen! So much fun and so worth your penny. Not too expensive, so that's a plus. We really want to buy another copy to try and make a 4 player variation.

Everything from the size of the box to game length and the simplicity of the rules reminds of the Kosmos two-player line.  Patchwork is a game about balancing needs for puzzle pieces to make a quilt against income and time.  Information is completely open.  If that sounds brain-burny, it really isn't because choices are limited each turn. The net result is a charming and clever game.

The artwork - with each of those puzzle-pieces redolent of scraps of fabric and buttons the currency - significantly adds to the charm.  Production quality is good.

Απλό και γρήγορο 2-player παιχνίδι από τον κ.Rosenberg. Κάθε γύρα αγοράζεις ένα tile και το τοποθετείς στο ταμπλό σου. Σκοπός είναι να γεμίσεις όσο πιο πολύ μπορείς το ταμπλό σου, ενώ ρόλο παίζει το turn order και το πότε θα ενεργοποιήσεις το εισόδημα σου. Το κάθε σχήμα στα tiles είναι μοναδικό.

Η αλληλεπίδραση όπως και στα περισσότερα eurogames περιορίζεται στο ποιος παίκτης θα προλάβει το τάδε tile, ενώ υπάρχουν και κάποια μικρά tiles δώρο σε όποιον τρέξει στο turn order, που μπαλώνουν τρύπες στο ταμπλό σου. Τίμιο παιχνίδι, συνιστάται σε όσους αρέσκονται στο tile placement.

Καλή πρώτη εντύπωση καθώς γενικά μου αρέσει το special element, δεν ξέρω πως πάει από replayability αλλά είναι ιδανικό για euro ζευγάρια και όχι μόνο.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
You're making a quilt by spending buttons to acquire patches of various sizes. Those patches have a cost in two currencies, however--not just buttons, but [i]time[/i]. Each patch requires that you move your marker some amount of distance up the time track to the impending end point, which triggers the close of the game. The player whose marker is last takes turns until they pass the other player's marker, etc... Some patches come with buttons, increasing your button income after passing certain intervals. But you can never earn time, only lose it. Points are scored for accumulated buttons, as well as the difference between covered and uncovered spots on your quilt.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
The grueling crunch. Carefully balancing the expenditure of time and buttons is very, very difficult. This is a two-player game. You either win or lose, and the other player is likely calculating the most efficient path to shredding your score. Trying to figure out the time versus buttons versus quilt coverage versus income equation is very crunchy, and the game is actually quite brutal in typical Uwe Rosenberg fashion. Quilting has never been so devastating.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
This is often described as a "wife game" (a moniker I find distasteful) because it has a low barrier to entry and has a "cute theme," meaning it's great for dumb women, right? Wrong. First, that's a ludicrous and sexist distinction. Second, as I noted above, this game is no innocent cakewalk, it's a serious and challenge competition. /soapbox

RATING: 6
This is a game that mixes a Tetris type puzzle with simple patch choice decisions, and a slight time use element.  As much as I would like to enjoy this game (after all Uwe designed it), there is just not enough of interest in this game for me to enjoy. 

Personally, I find Tetris type decisions boring, which leaves me with trying to enjoy the extremely modest purchasing and time decisions in the game.  Not interested in playing this game a second time, so must give it a 6 at best.

Not the type of game I ever expected to see from Uwe and was a little leery about it but gave it a try anyways.

Great two player game.  At first I was thinking this would fall flat, just the simplicity of it wouldn't be meaty enough.  However, there's a lot going on.  Do I take this piece and give my opponent control to get that next patch?  Or do I take the smaller piece and go again, but not get that piece with a lot of buttons that fills the exact hole on my board I needed.  Much agony with each choice.  What a cracker of a game.

Doing a puzzle at the same time as your opponent is nice!  Not very adversarial.  The game is a really traditional euro in that sense, though I may never buy any more euro games.

This is a pretty bland game in my opinion. The puzzle/tetris element doesn't really appeal to me. Trying to map out how to get your opponent to set you up for the pieces you want and trying to manipulate turn order and button/patch bonuses is kind of fun. There is definitely a bit of strategy here, but it is mostly a dull abstract. I probably wouldn't ever play this again, but my wife likes to pull it out from time to time, so I'll continue to play with her.

A nice balancing act between valuing the three types of currency in the game (buttons, time, spaces covered). There's more luck introduced with the randomized setup than I'm entirely fond of, making some choices rather forced. The crux of the game seems to be in being well-prepared for the end game, leaving yourself the right type of space to continue placing pieces. Nice to see such a different theme on a game, and a good combination of puzzling with some light competition.

For such a simple game, this game was a pleasant surprise; it combines a multitude of decisions under a very simple rule set. It is a lovely melody of engine-building, tile valuation, turn-order manipulation, and a Tetris like abstract puzzle that creates some interesting blocking decisions. For casual gamers, the rules are simple and the purchasing limitations provide a focus. But for competitive gamers, there is no in-game randomization and the game invites players to think several turns ahead. The end result is a game that may just be the ultimate filler... quick, easy to learn, and enjoyed by casual and competitive gamers alike.

A very nice 2 player game. Simple rules, yet there's a bit of a challenge in trying to fit those patches, and knowing when to go for more buttons, or for wasting less time. It gets old after a few plays, but it's a very good designed game: one that falls back to Rosenberg's elegant designs before all his worker placement heavy nonsense.

Quite fast of a game for 2 players. It takes a few rounds to get the game, which for now does seem to have the strategy : 'go for the biggest pieces around, don't leave anything uncovered'..we'll see, but in any case its playtime makes it easy to put on the table and its theme is not totally abhoring (yes, it is fricking stitching, hot interesting could that be huh?!?)

Brilliant, simple but quite deep two-player game, very different by any other design by Uwe.

Rules are straightforward. You can only do one of the two actions (last player on a timetrack moves):
1) buy a patch and sew it on your quilt, paying with buttons, and advance on a timetrack;
2) advance on the timetrack until you reach the opponent and gain buttons for the spaces moved.
If you pass one of a series of special spot, gain a mini-patch (if you pass over it first) or buttons.

The simple, clever combination of a timetrack mechanic (à la Thebes) and a tetris-like puzzle is very elegant and compelling, and the unusual theme is quite engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Such an excellent design! The mechanics are clever and efficient, the playing time matches the depth, and the player interaction strikes just the right balance between indirect and direct. I can't quite put my finger on why but Uwe Rosenberg's games are always so... nice. Maybe it's because they are just as much about beating your own score as they are about beating your opponents.

:d10-2:

Yep, this one has more depth than I had thought upon first glance. After the first two plays, I had a suspicion that there was more to be seen. And on plays three and four, I saw it.

The economics of the game works out that tile prices are basically balanced around six costs/benefits:

1) Button cost, i.e. VP cost
2) Time cost, i.e. finite resource equal between players
3) Tempo cost, i.e. actions given up to the other player in order to do this particular action
4) Button gain, i.e. regular source of VPs which rewards early investment
5) Spatial coverage, i.e. one time VP gains
6) Shape irregularity, i.e. loss of chance at bonus VPs and/or potential spatial coverage

All of these concerns interact with one another in interesting ways. BUT, the [i]one[/i] cost that can be entirely negated with good play is #6. Shape irregularity. If you plan to get the exactly fitting pieces and place them correctly, you can gain more of the other benefits while skirting the typical costs associated. This means that the more advanced you get, the more the geometry of the game takes center stage. Thus, a game that seems to be a cute, light economic engine game becomes a brain puzzling spatial organization test paired with a savagely clever turn order and tile opportunity dance.

I really want to play this well.

It's so simple I can teach this to anybody in 2 minutes but it's got some depth to it.

Oh man, my wife loves Patchwork. She's a crafter, for a start, so the theme is right on the button (haha) for her but she also can't get enough of the Tetris-style puzzle that the game offers. Me, I find it extremely stressful knowing every square I fail to patch is going to cost me two points at the end of the game, and I feel like I'm in a mad scramble just to avoid absolute failure. It's worse even than Agricola's constant feed-your-family dread. I'm yet to beat her, and in fact I'm yet to score positive points in a game, but I'll definitely play this again.

Fun game for two players with an "ultimate goal" that's hard to achieve. It's surprisingly difficult to fill every square on the board. I do find that filling the board is pretty unimportant compared to collecting buttons, which turns the game into a surprising Economic game rather than a focused Tile Placement game. There's certainly merit to balancing both, and in the end the game is still fun and pleasantly quick.

Lighter than I thought it was going to be.  It is also has more too it than just the spacial aspect.  While spacial games usually are not my cup of tea, I had fun playing this one, and would like to play it again sometime.  Not really sure the theme works at all in this one ( I think Quit show is the better "quilting" game ).

Nov 2017 - a very solid 7.  Quick two player game that has some tough choices and a bit of race to it.  I heard others say if you had this, you did not need Cottage Garden and vice versa.  I don't buy that.  This is different enough.  They don't feel the same.  That would be like stating if you have this, you don't need Princes of Florence.  

I like this.

Well this is a beguiling little board game, charming players into deceptively simple and easy to explain gameplay mechanics, but immediately reveals its strategic depth, forcing players to anticipate one anothers' needs and throat cutting their way to victory.

A two currency economic 2-player game with a spatial tetris-like dimension to it.  Although it plays in 15ish minutes, it creates a lot of thinkiness and opportunities for clever play.  The random initial set-up ensures multiple games will often play out differently; however, there is no danger of "white-to-play-and-win" as the leap-frogging aspect creates a deeper, more nuanced game.

Hard to believe it's a Uwe Rosenberg or that he managed to put so much depth into a game with two rules.  Great game!

Patchwork is a fantastic 2 player game that becomes more enjoyable the more I play it. The simplicity of the setup and teaching time make it very accessible, but the depth of strategy with multiple plays make this a classic in my collection. I love Uwe Rosenberg's two player games (Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is also a winner) and I am very excited to see if he will release more. The theme of this game is perfect. I never thought that I would say I have a blast playing a game about quilting but the more I play it the more I realize this is the best theme for this Tetris style puzzler. The price, the time to play, the ease of learning and the enjoyable theme make this game a very strong recommendation for me and one of my favorite two player only games of all time. The game is cute, but it's still enjoyable for guys to play and get into. This game feels like the Little Big Planet of the tabletop world. Very kid friendly and whimsical but deep enough that any age will have fun. Buy this for yourself, buy it for a friend, we need to support these two player releases because they are perfect for coffee shop date nights with a spouse or a lunch filler with a friend. Good job Uwe and Mayfair, bravo.

The button economy is awesome, I like the tetris part but I don't love it.

Solid two player game. Possibly expected a little too much of it given the hype surrounding it since its release. My missus absolutely loves it, so very pleased I won a copy in a G4GG lottery!

My rating has increased with more plays - it's just such a tight and engaging game for two players. A game I never seem to refuse when it's suggested.

Opinión tras 3 partidas. Es posible que después de jugarlo más sea capaz de ver algo más de estrategia. Por ahora, me parece que es relativamente más ligero de lo que pensaba (y me hacía pensar su puntuación) pero puede ser porque no he jugado con nadie que lo conociera de antes. Los ultimos turnos pueden ser interesantes para al principio parece que hay poco que pensar... simplemente conseguir botones para cobrarlos N-veces. Como táctica creo que es mejor no irse a lo loco a hacer el 7x7 porque eso al final no te deja coger piezas grandes. Es posible que suba la puntuación según lo vaya jugando.

- Patchwork: Button Upgrade

Patchwork... A little two player game about making patchwork quilts. Purchasing the perfect patch then meticulously arranging it on your quilt. Honestly I passed up on this game when it was first released do to the theme, I didn't really think a game like this would do it for me. But it turns out I was almost wrong... While I'm still not sold on actually liking the theme, I have to admit that it really works with the mechanics of the game. And I really like those mechanics, I'm looking forward to getting this to the table again.

Damn I'm bad at this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a fantastic two player game, with such a lot to think about and a surprising range of tactical problems arising from what seems like a simple set up. Which should be no surprise, given Uwe Rosenberg's track record, other than the 'simple set up' part.

Patchwork feels really fresh, with an offbeat theme and design elements we hadn't seen before - though the spatial puzzle & rotating choice of pieces has since been partially recycled in Cottage Garden, with elements in A Feast for Odin and elsewhere.

The heart of the game though is the delicate balancing act between the cost of pieces in both time and 'money' and their benefits in terms of income and both space covered and their fit with the Tetris-y puzzle you're solving. 

And, in case that's not enough, you really should be looking out for how the choices you make impact on your opponent in terms of the options your move gives them - what looks like a less than ideal move can force them into a tactical dead end, particularly if they're low on funds, and open new options for you. Superb.

Going into this one, I thought it would be one of those light, fluffy games, where everything is balanced to where scores will just be close, and the decisions would all kind of come out in the wash.

However, this is not true at all, as you can definitely play well or poorly, and scores can be quite lopsided. It was nice to see that the decisions mattered a great deal! You'll be doing a lot of calculating on which tile scores the most points per unit of time spent to acquire it, while also trying to avoid setting up your opponent for good tiles.

The game still didn't really grab me though, and I can't put my finger on why that is. I think it just ended up a bit on the abstract side for my tastes, but is still a game I'd happily play along with if someone else wanted to play.

I was expecting to like this much more considering all the enthusiastic reviews. We have played this a couple of times but haven't felt the desire to return to it, possibly because of the spatial aspect which doesn't appeal to either of us.

Lovely 2-player filler game that is a big hit with my wife. The artwork is very colorful and perfect for the theme and even though the game only lasts about 30 minutes, there are a lot of interesting decisions to be made. I especially loved the balance between buttons and time as resources when considering the cost of patches to purchase. Very different from the heavy Rosenberg farming euros but still an excellent game from him that my wife and I will gladly play for a long time!

This is an incredibly fun little game.  Spacial awareness, a la Tetris, plays in under 30 minutes, easy to learn, but so much going on, and I am sure the game plays different every time.  I am sure I will find a way to get burned out on this one, but after one play I am itching to play it more.  First play there was so much going on that it was nice to think a couple of turns ahead to see how you could hopefully get yourself a specific tile!  I won the first game, which definitely helps, but I can see this being one I get pounded on more often than not.  Looking forward to getting this to the table more.

Clever variable set up abstract game. Plays quickly. I enjoy trying to control the tempo of the game, what my opponent can take based on their button count and space, and forcing them to give me good pieces and the singles.

Heard many great reviews of this game. Feels casual and laid back for a 2-player strategy game - much like the theme. 

I'm not sure how deep the strategy goes, as I tend to think only a single move ahead with this one. 

Played with my 5yr old without problems. He grasped the idea of the quilt easily, but failed to plan ahead or consider my actions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Based on 1 play:

I can see why this is so beloved. This is a nice, accessible game that 1) seamlessly blends abstract spatial puzzling with light resource/economy management and 2) plays fast. I would happily, unreservedly recommend it to folks just getting into the hobby looking for a quick, replayable 2p game.

For someone with a robust 2p collection already though, I'm not sure how long this will stick with me. For now I look forward to playing again (although having won my first game and achieved a satisfying score, I'm not sure what I'd do differently). Seems like a good game to bring along any old place, and play with anyone who will sit and listen to the 1 minute rules explanation. It seems like a good "vacation" game - portable, easy to remember the rules, meaty but still playable after a bottle of wine or a few beers. Is it what I'll reach for when I'm home and want to really test my puzzling skills against my spouse, though? Over YINSH or Hive? Probably not.

A very Euro-y 2-player abstract, from Uwe Rosenberg of all people. 

There is an engine-building game where you accumulate income generating tiles for intermediate income phases, layered over a tetris like tile placement abstract. It works surprisingly well. It takes two minutes to explain, and has some meat to it.

I don't really have many opportunities to play a game like this so I can't rate it that highly, but I admire the design.

Not enough meaty gameplay there for us. I understand the delicacies of the game, but it is still fairly easy to play/calculate the best move. However, what I find really annoying is that long-term (that go beyond the current move) are virtually impossible the execute, as every move depends on the previous move of the opponent.

This is a great game! Simple decisions each turn, take income or buy a piece, still makes for a surprisingly tight and fun game. The tetris like aspect of the quilt pieces to fit on your board adds a special charm to this one too. Even though I didn't build my quilt as best as I could having to take income the last few turns, I was surprised I still only lost by 1 point. I'm sure with more plays we will be better at completing our grids and the scores will be better, but this is another game that does well on the play again factor. I think the only potential downside to this one is you need a fair amount of table space to get all the quilt patches out on the table.

Patchwork, like the name suggests, is a cozy little puzzle of a game. Not having an abundance of games that work well with only two people, I thought I'd listen to the hype and pick it up.

It's good! The rules are dead simple and a game goes by in about 30 minutes. It has a hidden complexity that reveals itself after multiple plays that smaller, simpler eurogames tend to have. It's a solid game for a quick play, but I've found that it doesn't have enough crunch on it for me to want to play it all the time.

A neat economic game with low rules overhead to make it very accessible.

You are balancing the spending of two currencies with one (buttons) serving as a constraint, and the other (time) serving as a game clock.  Both currencies are spent in an effort to fill a game board.  Weighing the pros and cons of buttons vs. time costs lead to some interesting tipping points in the game.

What raises this game above normal filler games is how pieces are selected.  One can only choose a piece within three spaces of the last piece chosen.  This leads to some double-think and extortive piece selection to try to hem your opponent into less profitable moves.  Bolting this on top of the economic game discussed above makes it a great addition to my collection.

Super fun tile laying game for 2 players with an economic element.  Outside of FITS, Ubongo and, of course, Tetris; I usually don't care for Tetris style pieces in games. Actually, I fucking hate games with Tetris style pieces! But this one was quite enjoyable.

Great 2-player game.  I had played the app a few times, and then went out to buy the board game version.

Straightforward, fair amount of strategy involved in knowing when to buy and pass effectively.

Requires a surprising amount of table space at early stages.

Rosenberg has redeemed himself after the bloated monstrosity that is Caverna by creating this tight little puzzle game.  Addictive and seemingly simple, it contains subtle levels of strategy that reveal themselves after more and more plays.  I believe in you again Uwe! Creativity at last instead of more Agricola rehashes.

Naprawdę jedna z lepszych gier dwuosobowych, jakie posiadam w kolekcji. Niesamowicie proste zasady, wysoka regrywalność, ciekawa tematyka (niech Panowie się absolutnie nie zniechęcają do szycia kołderki) sprawia, że chętnie sięgamy po tą pozycję i za każdym razem mamy dużo frajdy z rozgrywki. Partia jest krótka, chęć rewanżu i kolejnej rozgrywki jest bardzo silna. Jeśli lubiłeś w dzieciństwie grać w Tetrisa, to Patchwork musi zagościć w kolekcji. Przez swoje proste zasady i lekkość tej kołderki gra idealnie wpasuje się w różne grono wiekowe odbiorców, można w nią śmiało grać z dzieckiem, jak i z seniorem.

Perfect, abstract game for 2 players. I was sceptical when i heard about a game with buttons as a currency and some pieces of material that you need to put in the blanket but i was SOOOOOOO WRONG, this game is awesome, a bit of tetris on the board but it actually requires some planning if you really want to get the piece of material you need. Simple rules and great fun.

Really light and enjoyable game. I haven't so much experience in abstract games, but this one it seems really good for me. Although you only have to choose between two actions for each of your moves per turn, you always have to have in mind your possible next moves and how those could be affected from your opponent. This may be the main characteristic of this kind of games, at least that was what I felt by playing my first patchwork game. This makes you constantly focused on the game all the time where you are trying to complete and select the next pieces of your kilt that will cover the most of the available surface.

I can't rate the game right now, since I have played it only once, but there are many strategies for sure! I first tried to get the 7x7 tile. I did it, but I find it hard afterwards to complete the rest of the grid. Perhaps, It could better not to fully aiming at getting the 7x7 tile but trying to get it by filling the grid eventually.

This game gets played a lot at my house.  Its easy to teach and play.  I don't give it a 10 despite how many times it gets to our table due to the random factor.  After playing a lot of games I think the luck of the turn order and the 3 tiles coming up can allow someone to win despite not having a better strategy.  The first game I played with my 8 year old (who is good at games) she destroyed me.  She had no strategy with placement but because she had the buttons to buy the patch she did.

A very fast and engaging 2-player game which uses the "whomever is behind gets to go next" time mechanism from Thebes and other games. You've got two layers going on - the Tetris-style arrangement of your board, and weighing if it's worth spending more time to get a piece with more buttons to help you later.

Definitely needs more plays but this feels like a good fit for us.

I was ignoring this game for a long time since the theme turned me really off. But now I am glad to give it a try (mainly because it was very cheap so I could include to my shipment).
This is a quick, tight and fun 2 player only game which reminds tetris a bit. There are three major things to consider when taking a tile - cost (number of buttons spent to buy it), time (how many time points you will move ahead on the time board when buying the tile) and the shape and size (how many fields can you cover with it and how will it fit into your board).
Some tiles have 1-3 buttons included on themselves and these serve as a source of income (there are several income thresholds in the game where you will gain buttons according to the buttons on your tiles), but these are more expensive (both in cost and time) that the tiles without buttons. 
You can choose only three of the tiles after the current position on the tile market. And you have infinite number of time points to spent, your button count is very tight (at least at the beginning of the game) so you should do your best to fill as much as possible (and maybe scoring 7x7 bonus)

What I like:
- this is very interesting economy game with three currencies (buttons, time and space) and you have to find out which is the most important for you to save at the moment. This leads to very interesting game decisions as you prefer different tiles according to the game stage and your progress.
- Games are quick, this can be finished under 15 minutes when both players are somewhat experienced with it.
- Visual aspect of the game is cute. I bet all women will like it (you mother, sister, girlfriend, wife..)
- you can see your progress in this game. First several games you will often have negative score, but as you learn it more and more, the score will rise - this is very satisfying 

What I dislike:
- I was not interested in this because of the theme. I thought game about needling? no thanks. But I was so wrong. The theme could be easily about building the city or something like that, it doesn't matter.
- the setup (randomization of the tiles) is a bit long and boring for me - I like to have all randomized a lot in my games, so I need to pay attention to this a lot before game. Problem is that the tiles are with different sizes so you must pick them carefully to provide true randomization.
- The game may feel a bit repetitive once you found how to play it properly. There is not much different strategies involved, you simply just try to do similar things in every game (but the tile offer is always different). But this is OK as I play this just as a relaxing 2 player game.

2 player game.  Spacial/abstract, which usually aren't my style game, but this one works.  You need to balance the acquisition of buttons, advancing in time too fast, filling the quilt spaces, double plays, and looking ahead on future pieces.

The first time we played, we concentrated way too much on neat and tidy quilts while ignoring pieces with buttons.  It resulted in massive negative scores.  After a few plays we found a better balance and started producing positive scores.

I ordered a bag of 100 random buttons from Amazon for $4.87 and will replace the cardboard buttons for real ones.

Update:

We've played it a few more times and have really come to like to nuances.  Tonight we played on teams (couple v couple) and it was a lot of fun.

We found this game to be so simply that it verges on boring.  Your play choices are almost always decided for you by the random layout of the patches. Take most beneficial points tile you can afford until out of buttons, and then take buttons.  Rinse and repeat.  We'll probably give it a few more tries, but I'm guessing this one will be off to the trade pile.

This game is AWESOME! It's so satisfying finding the perfect piece of fabric to fill an empty spot on your patchwork. I've twice fully completed my patchwork board now in normal play which is so rare and utterly fulfilling.
The game is a bit like Tetris and takes many plays to work out an ideal strategy. You're choice depend on what the player before chooses, so if predict their choices you can influence their decisions to, making this far more strategic than you would imagine.
The game doesn't loose it's playability either, we've been playing it regularly for 6 months now. It's a game that doesn't take long to set up and can be enjoyed in under an hour making it the perfect light evening entertainment after work without having to commit time or multiple days to.

A fine game. enjoyed it more at first than i thought i would. After a couple of plays it felt very samey though. You don't have many options to base your decisions on and it becomes an exercise in low level accounting, min-maxing each turn and balancing long term gains (getting that income engine going) vs. getting your board full with larger pieces. It all works very well but didn't feel too exciting and much more linear than i thought it would after 4 or 5 plays.

Seeing the notes I thought it was a joke. Second family game ? I have a hard time seeing this in this game. There's a huge random effect on the initial disposition. This effect gets even more present from the fact that a favorable disposition gets you more buttons, which gets you more points and coins to spend, and less for your adversary, all this considering you're tight on money for the first few turns. The only option the other player has to mitigate is catch up on the board on the other player and get money for it, sacrificing in the process precious board tiles that are also a currency, all of this while sacrificing a turn that the richest player will be able to potentially steal yet another button tiles.

In my opinion, strategy and mechanics are interesting, but a bit too much on the random side at set up =/

Overally I think many other games with better mechanics and theme are much more of that second spot (including the equally tetris-y Out of mine

* Theme & srtwork is about as boring as it can get.

If it wasn't for the pricepoint I would add this to my collection. $20aud game at most.

Its amazing how many things you have to pay attention to in this simple game. You can't just build your own quilt- you have to look at what pieces your opponent probably wants, where you both are on the time track, how and when to maximize the buttons you get, &c. 
Its definitely an intriguing little game.

THE perfect 2-player game. Moments to set up, taught in 5 min., can be grasped and enjoyed by kids in elementary school, but has depth that will challenge avid strategy gamers.

1) Initial state is random = Solid replayability
2) After setup, perfect information (nothing hidden or random) = Opportunity for deep strategic analysis
3) Limited options at any give time = Quick play (unless you're really working #2)
4) Warm, cuddly theme = Wide appeal to gamers of all sensitivity levels.
5) Quality components = Many years of enjoyment

Any game designer could take immense and well-deserved satisfaction to have created Patchwork. How incredible that this perfect gem shares a home shelf with the likes of Agricola, Fields of Arle, Caverna, Le Havre, and soon, A Feast For Odin!

RATING: 8
Great little tile-laying puzzler that uses the balancing of four variables -- tile cost, tile size, tile income value and time/limited-moves -- to off-set the usual two-player back-and-forth.  Not yet sure if a button income strategy is better than a time strategy. (August 2015)

An instant delight, almost as if the clock has been wound back to 1999 and Lost Cities has just appeared again.  An elegant blend of simple, intuitive mechanics, combining fitting puzzle pieces onto a board, working an economic engine, and managing time.  Lots of games have been tapped here, but it all works very well.  Nice to see Rosenberg stop re-inventing his own sprawling heavy games, and go back to something lighter.  Loved it.

Few small caveats this game takes up a little too much table space, it plays only with two (see cottage garden), and is essentially themeless. That said, this game is incredibly simple, satisfying and fun. It's like two player tetris with an economic element. I am convinced that going for the button cash is better than going for the perfect quilt (word looks wrong to me) as having more cash you can say yes to whatever and zip ahead to snag those useful single patches. I have seen people bemoan this games high rating. Yes it's not brass or powergrid, it doesn't feature plastic wizards or epic space battle. It's simpler than that, less grande. It's a fun two player puzzler to play after tea (dinner) with your significant other. You could gift this to almost anyone without too much concern that they wouldn't like it, unless they hate quilts (still looks wrong) a lot.

This is a polished design that integrates a spatial puzzle (like Tetris or Ubongo), a light economic element, and a time track system into a 2-player abstract that is very pleasant to play.   It's not overly thinky, even though there is zero luck.   The pieces are not evenly costed, and can be quite situational, plus you can only purchase from the next 3.  So, while there is some look-ahead, the AP is not severe.   Not to mention, they totally got the look of the game correct.   Very impressed with this one.

RATING: 8.5
I make this ranking before having played either Feast for Odin or Barenpark. Back when Patchwork was the only game to experiment with the idea of filling a board with various sized tetrisy pieces, I was enamored. Careful planning, both on when to execute certain purchases and where to place them, is pivotal to success and there's a strong satisfaction to nearly completing the board (I've not yet seen anyone pull off a full board.)

Now I need to see how I find these new-comers. If Barenpark or Feast for Odin prove better games than Patchwork, then I'll likely see Patchwork drop a couple points - whereas, if Patchwork still proves my preferred game in this genre, I'll be pumping it up a little bit.

Nice little game. Doesn't require much thought but offers up a satisfying race with puzzle elements built in. Would never want to play with seasoned gamers because its just far too light. Its entertaining enough to play with non-gamers and something which may act as a gateway game into the hobby for some.

Uwe Rosenberg in some light two player action.   Pretty good game too.
It's about fitting shapes, tetris style or tangram if you're old enough to remember those, into a square grid.  And over in 20 minutes. 

I am utterly and completely hopeless at this sort of game, being devoid of any spatial perception.  Nevertheless it is actually really good fun to play.  More importantly I think Mrs.D. is going to really like it.

The more I play this game, the more I think it's one of the best two player games out there. Replayability isn't the best, but it's an excellent mix of fun and think-y.

Highly recommended!

Lovely two player race to acquire various shapes of quilting material, essentially playing a solo game of Blokus but racing for the pieces.

Great fun!

I was skeptical when I first saw pictures of Patchwork. Tetris-esque pieces and a quilting theme... yeah. It has lovely graphic design, but so did Nika. After numerous positive comments from Geekbuddies and BGG in general, I decided to check it out. I was very pleasantly surprised. Normally, I actively dislike 2-player abstracts with many permutations to churn. After setup, this is a perfect information abstract, and while you do need to churn some permutations, it doesn't feel as weighed down to me in this game compared to Chess and similar games. I think it has to do with the fact that you don't have many different pieces to consider moving. It's just the common piece and your own piece. Even when pondering various moves, this game still plays pretty quickly. There are many layers to your decision with regards to time, income, shapes, the common pawn positioning, time-track positioning. It's just pretty lovely. The theme and puzzley nature should make it appealing for couples.

One of my favorite 2 player games right now. The mix of 2 different currency's works great and in a cute thematic way. It is an abstract game, but it's inherent cuteness makes you forget about that for a while.

The pace of the game can vary dramatically with the initial tile placement, and I suppose it is possible for some unusual layouts to stifle the game play at times. Because it is a two player game, any effect like this can be mitigated with strategic planning.

RATING: 7
A favorite, non-card 2p game. The juggling of the two currencies (buttons & time) makes for very interesting decisions. The 7x7 bonus tile, is basically a game-ender, but players have a lot of ability to deny their opponents of the prize. Suprisingly tactical, yet charming and light. After a handful of plays, I have found myself over-gaming the experience. Instead of playing the game as a light and casual one, I try to insert more strategy than is needed. Its just a little bit too light for me to love, but my wife likes it so we still play it occasionally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Perfect blend of abstract tile placement, turn order jockeying, and mild economic engine building.  Since play time is brisk, it has that addictive "let's play that one more time" quality where you want to not only beat your opponent but fill up your grid more efficiently than your last game.

I avoided this game for quite a long time because of the theme, but then I kept hearing it being mentioned a lot as a really good abstract (and who can resist a really good abstract?) so I got the app. Patchwork is basically a spatial reasoning abstract strategy economic puzzle that is dressed in pretty pieces. It uses the Time Track mechanism as in Thebes and Glen More so the person in the last position on the track always goes first. You need to balance your need for income (buttons), with the necessity to also cover your board almost completely or risk the penalty for uncovered spaces. Usually the patches with the most buttons don't cover as many spaces as larger button-less patches (although there are certain exceptions) so there are certain tricky decisions to be made with those, and also fitting the patches you choose with the others already on your board.

At first I thought there was a quite high element of luck because my win rate was about 50% and I thought it depended upon the patches available to me. It turns out there is a bit more than that involved. Now that I have more experience and over 100 wins, I kind of grok the strategy. A more experienced player will usually crush a newbie and there is a guy who played over 300 games and lost only 20. Now that is IMPRESSIVE! Some people have a knack for both being able to present you with crap options on your turn, and make a garden of roses out of it if those same options are presented to them on their turn. The 7x7 bonus I look at as a catch up mechanism for the person with the least buttons. However, in general I tend to see the person with the button lead getting that bonus as well. If that happens it's a surety that person will win. Games are more fun for me if it's a tight close race to the end. The foregone conclusion is disappointing.

It's a nice little challenge and after playing on the app I can say I definitely will not be getting a hard copy.
1. Due to the asynchronous nature of play I can play a few minutes here and there whenever I get a chance,
2. I can run several games at a time with many different opponents,
3. The interface is beautiful and the patches graphics change from game to game,
4. Games are quick and interesting, if a bit dry and mathy
5. But most of all...The other half is not that good at spatial reasoning and while the game is cute and clever, it just doesn't offer enough to enter it in the collection.

A cool little abstract strategy game with a theme that appeals to some people in my family. Strategy and tactics are there, but not super deep. It's more about looking a few turns ahead to decide if taking a sub-optimal piece will benefit you in future actions or inconvenience your opponent. This game would be dull if not for the way turn ordering works with the time track economy, which is where a lot of the strategy is. Points off because the pieces don't always fit together. - 2016/12/05

Ahhh Uwe, keep pumping out these great 2 player games and I'll keep buying them.  I like tetris and games that work my visual/spatial skills and this game definitely scratches the itch.  Was pleasantly surprised after 2 plays on how the scoring works and how tight it is.  (didn't do any review watching before playing), didn't expect it to be so easy to go negative in this game if you aren't careful.

A perfect game, in the sense of an idea fully realized. The mechanisms work perfectly, the chess-like strategies become apparent after only a few plays, and the variable setup makes every game a new challenge. A game with a genius internal economy that's so simple you can play it with your mother, but so deep you can play it for years to come.

RATING: 6.5
Elegant design. Simple and quite engaging. It's not easy to find the best way to acquire the tiles. You must consider cost in time, cost in buttons, future income opportunities, and of course how the piece fit into your board. On top of that, you must watch what your opponent want. However, since it's impossible to calculate the impact of all these, you must use your gut feeling. Therefore, the game floats quite well.

Really neat bin packing puzzle.  More to it than first glance, because you need to manage both space on your board and time spent (which can end up ending the game before you've managed to fill much on your board).

Plus, it's a rare game that passes the Wife Test.

Initial impressions are positive. I'm curious to see how it plays out over 10 times.

For my [b]second play[/b], I taught my partner, and as a result, we played 5 times in a row. So this paragraph is also about my [b]sixth play![/b] It is simple, and it isn't exciting, but it's a simple puzzle that keeps offering different pieces with with to solve the problem of patching a quilt. Balancing buttons, time, and space as currency, as well as the acquisition of leather patches, and the competition for prized pieces...well, it's just a very cool, very quick challenge. Abstract, but addictive.

RATING: 9
I played with an experienced player and although I had a good score on my 2nd game, was still beaten soundly.  I was perplexed how I lost, something that usually isn't difficult to evaluate.  I had the same number of buttons, I managed to get more turns, I had nearly the same number of empty spaces (negative points), and gained my share of filler tiles.  I didn't get the free tile, nor the bonus tile, but that didn't account for all of the difference.  The winner told me she goes after the biggest tiles.  True, but I think obtaining lots of buttons early is the primary key, so you receive money more times for the same buttons, since money wins the game.  Just 1 or 2 lower payouts early on could lose the game.  

Pluses: Planning ahead strategy, spatial relationships, easy rules, quick setup, half hour filler game, interesting. The game itself is more attractive than the dull looking box.

Cons:  the puzzle pieces don't always fit together well so there is a little fear of damaging the pieces.  Hard to catch someone with a good start.

Especially addictive if you like puzzles.  Many of the pieces are identical to Cathedral & Blokus ones.  Great kids game.

After playing this game a few times, raised my rating.  This is a much greater strategic game than I had realized with the first play.  Timing, a specific kind of planning ahead, turns out to be a huge  an important part of this game.  The fourth game turned into a real brain burner.

Raising rating again after 11 plays to 9.  T

he BGG game weight is rated at 1.70.  Because of the advanced strategy in such a deceptively simple game, I think the weight should be a 3.5.

Patchwork continues to impress me with how easy it is to play and how deep it can be. It never gets too much past a tactical level of planning, but every one of those decisions is equally agonizing and satisfying. A well-played game is also incredibly satisfying as you gradually patch up every open spot on your board. Those things plus an ideal length combine to make Patchwork one of my top 5 two player games, and one of my top 25 overall. Highly recommended!

Good solo option and a fun puzzle for two players.  Fitting pieces together is fun, and you can play it in a more relaxed manner or start thinking several turns ahead and make your head hurt.

iOS: Love it on iOS!  A little clunky for for online multiplayer but I've gotten in over 50 plays and I think given the success it will be supported with further updates.

Update: rating goes 8.5->8->7.5 ... I went back after a break and it is feeling a bit mechanical.  There's a lot to it but I'm no longer excited to play.  Yes I would still recommend it though.

What a glorious theme and some pretty brainy gameplay, though it can be very easy going too if you want to play it that way. I think for the first couple of plays one might feel too limited by the three patch options on their turn, but there is a deeper game of timing here that needs to be recognized in order to do well.  This is an excellent game that is more than a filler but plays out in a quick time and is a very pleasant 2p game.  Great work, Uwe!

RATING: 9
I really admire the elegance of the rules in this game. The interlocking of money and time currencies make for a very pleasant game.

With repeated plays, my wife and I have found that we can sometimes be faced with a three-tile sequence offering no interesting choice. One game effectively stalled because neither of us was willing to pick a tile from a 'bad' lot, when we both needed a tile coming right after. That one game really was a sour experience and we haven't enjoyed patchwork as much since.

Really cool for a simple two play game! The decisions you make have a lasting effect since you're limited on space. Clever mechanisms abound, it plays quick, looks nice. I believe you have to play this quite a bit to get used to the tiles available, as that would lead to better planning. I really like what Uwe did with this though. Kudos.

Great two player tile placement game. 
You're trying to make quilts, the currency is buttons, both will have the same "time" to make the best quilt possible and you get negative points for all unpatched parts. Thematically is good and it's a lot more fun that what it sounds!

Purchased at Wonko's after yesterday my wife said she wanted a puzzle to play while I solo played my games which she doesn't like.  It's like a 2p puzzle, right?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a really nice set of mechanisms. I love the time track, it's one of my favourite mechanisms. The patch puzzle is fun, but somewhat banal at times since you only ever have at most 3 patches to choose from and some of those you may not be able to afford. The button economy works, but it's so obvious that buttons on patches are super-imortant, especially early in the game, that all other patches (and there's plenty of them) become practically worthless for at least the first half of the game. This combined with only 3 choices of patches, of which you can't always afford all, means that the game is too void of hard decisions to be interesting to me. You can argue that how you place your patches is an interesting decision, but because of the race to 7x7 it's a solid strategy to just build from one corner and outwards. There's also the choice of not picking a piece, but that's usually bad, not very fun and usually something you're forced to do, meaning that it's no choice at all. 

I also have a problem with the 7x7 bonus. It's good that there's some incentive to make a neat and hole-less quilt but the 14 button swing it generates practically guarantees victory, especially with 2 players of equal skill.

In conclusion, I liked the game, but I wanted to like it much more. It's held back by some issues that I'm not sure are fixable, it's simply not made to be the game I wanted it to be.

I'm a huge Uwe Rosenberg fan, though mostly of the Agricola style games he does.

This game is wonderful for me and my wife.  The time on it is great (20 minutes really).  Doesn't feel like we are fighting, and we can have conversations while we play.

It's a great game for two.  Deceptive depth, though it's certainly not on the order of his more full figured games.  

It's everything I want in a two player game.

A wonderful combination of different decisions: puzzling as you fit patches into your quilt, timing your purchases in relation to your income, and balancing the tradeoffs between patch size/shape, income potential, button cost and time cost. Supremely enjoyable to play.

A favorite of my my 4 y.o. who started playing when she was 3.5. She enjoys making her quilt and can beat me on occasion, only needing assistance to make sure she doesn't forget to take income, move her marker on the time track, make change, etc. Younger children can definitely play this game!

Will frequently grab this as a game to travel with. Though it takes up a surprisingly large amount of space. Just doesn't seem to have enough depth for me to rank it among the best 2p games. It seems relatively easy to calculate the 'value' of each tile. Taking tiles that have buttons on them early is obvious. Then you switch to tiles that cover more spaces later on. This arc is the same from play to play. The game is all in the timing of those choices.

Best played ruthlessly. Often, denying your opponent a great play is more important than taking a good play for yourself.

My rating keeps falling after I play other games that do similar things, but in a more satisfying way. The fact that many games play out where you have to pass your turn multiple times due to the fact that you don't have enough button income to purchase a tile is a frustrating byproduct of this one. Once I played Quadropolis, my spacial puzzle game itch was satisfied in a way that Patchwork can't match. Still a nice filler that I will eagerly play when suggested.

Fun 2-player game that my wife also loves to play. There's some interesting strategy in when you collect greater-income buttons vs. remaining income spaces, as well as cost of tiles vs. benefit (size).  Getting the 7x7 tile if often the deciding factor over who wins.  Sometimes ends with no moves left if large enough spaces aren't left for odd-shaped tiles.

I'm told that experienced players can make this a vicious and clever game, but in most of the first two plays, with neither of us quite sure how to thwart the opponent, it seemed too easy. Toward the end of game 2 we started to see opportunities for messing with each other, which gave me hope, but our two strategies still converged on almost exactly the same score. Hard to shake the feeling that it's more scripted than it looks.

A very nice little tile-placement game for two. Incorporates several different elements seamlessle (heh): oddly shaped tiles similar to Ubongo, resource management aspect around spending and earning buttons, and an almost push-your-luck element in how you advance the main dowel and what pieces that makes available to your opponent. It's all put together very well.

Foltvarrás kettesben
A két személyes játékok kedvelőinek mindenképpen figyelmébe ajánlom ezt a játékot. A könnyen érthető szabályok (ráadásul a játék magyar nyelven is elérhető) elsajátítása mellett a játék előkészítése is gyors és egyszerű, majd mehet a „kézimunka”. Bár mindig több választási lehetőséged van (melyik foltot használd fel, esetleg jobb-e lépni és megszerezni egy bőrfoltot vagy gombokat), maga a játék lendületesen halad előre. Célod, hogy beépítsd a teljes tábládat, ugyanis a végén komoly pontlevonás súlyt a be nem varrt helyekért. Nagyon tetszik, hogy minél inkább tökéletes formákra törekedsz, annál kevesebb gombot kapsz és szinte biztosan nem te leszel a nyertes, így „kényszerít” a játék arra, hogy a kreatív énedet alkalmazd. Próbáld ki, nem bánod meg.

Very neat game. It mixes the mechanics of Tetris with an economic twist. In the first game you think you're doing great until the final scoring when you can get way below zero! (First match ended with -6 vs -1)
Once you get to know it you will always go with the bigger and cheaper pieces.
The only downside is that if played with an extremely strategical attitude, it can lead to AP because at each turn you can calculate the score for each of the three purchasable pieces.
All in all a fun, quick and clever game.

Yay, Uwe finally did something different again! Not another "Agricola" style game which I can't see anymore.

This is a nice game and even though it's actually an abstract one, the "theme" is somewhat refreshing. Everything works well, you can plan ahead and keep your opponent in check which is great.

The only negative I have found is, that it feels like many other abstract games, so that I don't feel the need to own and play this, even though I like it. Time will tell, if I'll get it someday nonetheless.

Patchwork is a great little Lofi game: great rulest-to-depth-ratio. Not only is it an aesthetic treat (i.e., it's quirky and cute), it also offers a great series of small yet significant choices around six criteria which Ben Draper outlines so clearly in his comments:
[q=BennyD]1) Button cost, i.e. VP cost
2) Time cost, i.e. finite resource equal between players
3) Tempo cost, i.e. actions given up to the other player in order to do this particular action
4) Button gain, i.e. regular source of VPs which rewards early investment
5) Spatial coverage, i.e. one time VP gains
6) Shape irregularity, i.e. loss of chance at bonus VPs and/or potential spatial coverage
[/q]
The time cost is brilliant (although we've seen it elsewhere, e.g., [thing=12681][/thing]), it gives a great tempo and rythm to how and what you pick, above and beyond the immediate "how much does it cost, how much space does it cover, and what does it provide in terms of later economy" questions. This can be especially pleasureful in handing off control when the choices aren't terribly hot!

The spatial logic required of the patchworking process means that your ability to valuate the other components is directly linked to your ability (and/or desire) to add the particular shape to your board. This makes and breaks the "engine" part of the game and adds a great additional component to what is otherwise an economic tug-of-war without it muddying the clean and simple design.

Overall, Rosenberg has yet another hit on his hands which begs the question: now why doesn't he design a big game with this Lofi approach? :)

I absolutely loves this but my hubby is less passionate. Gave a copy to a couple friends for a Christmas gift and they loved them to pieces.

Uwe Rosenberg (Agricola/Caverna designer) first mini game for two players! I find this game very clever when you spend turns collecting "tetris" pieces to fit your board. The player who fits the board wins. But be careful as the bigger the pieces, the more time you will spend sewing it, which means other players will have more actions than you.

A very good two player game!

Patchwork is a delicious little two player abstract, which mixes Tetrus-like fitting of patches with the time mechanism from Thebes, and a spiral time track which winds down all too soon.

The choices between pieces to leave, spaces to pass, and how to alternate player active turns makes every decision critical, and often contradictory impulses war before decisions are made.

A clever, clever little two player game.

Interesting game. Love the theme, I sew, plus love puzzles, Tetris, etc... it’s so cute and colorful. Lots and lots to love here. 

Maybe because it is just too easy for me (I don’t have to really think, just play what seems natural), I don’t actually want to play that much. I want to want to play but it just seems to be lacking something.

I just think this game hits what I’m really good at naturally - spatial understanding, so there’s not really much of a game here for me.

Patchwork isn't just a tile-placement puzzle game, it's an economic game that forces players to manage two resources: time and money (buttons).

An added benefit of the quilting theme, not to mention the simple ruleset, is that Patchwork can work very well as a non-gamer's introduction to modern tabletop games.

I mainly game with my husband or my best friend, and when searching for 2-player games, this one kept popping up. I avoided it because of the theme, and then bought it for my mother-in-law's birthday. Played it with her and immediately went out to buy a copy for myself! Very simple rules, quick playtime, yet has so much more beneath the surface. Highly recommend if you're looking for a quick, engaging game that you can teach to, and play with, just about anyone.

Uwe Rosneberg újabb kétszemélyes kisdobozos játéka. Nem annyira mély mint a LeHavre és az Agricola kétszemélyes verziói, de a barátnőmet pont a témája ragadta meg nagyon. Tetrisből ismert alakzatú mintákat rakunk ki a pálya köré majd egy bábuval 1-3 lépést megtéve elvehetünk egy nekünk megfelelő alakzatot és lehelyezni a táblánkra. Az alakzatokért gombokkal fizetünk. De az alakzatok nem csak gombba, hanem időbe is kerülnek, amit a középső táblán lépjük le. Ha ott gombos mezőket lépünk át, akkor megkapjuk azokat a gombokat, amelyek az alakzatokon láthatók. Cél minél kevesebb hiánnyal lefedni a táblánkat. 

Egyszerű, szórakoztató játék, amelyben egyszerre kell az idővel és a gombokkal gazdálkodnunk.

I cannot say enough about this game. My favorite element of the game is the spatial element of placing the patches. It really feel like your building something. The gameplay offers a great balance of deep thinking, risk, luck, and planning. I love the marriage of the two resources of buttons and time. The random layout of patches makes the game very replayable. When you consider that this game offers so much in a 30 minute playtime it comes out as a perfect 10 for me.

Pentomino puzzle game elegantly mixed with typical Euro economics. I admire the design, but the abstract nature makes actually game-play either like or hate. I belong to the like-side, as most people do.

Although everything can be evaluated directly by the final score([filepage=127004][/filepage]), players still have some tough decisions on how to balance the score with the cash flow and the remaining space.

Most of the time I can choose among 1-2 tiles and usually it is very obvious which one is better. In early rounds you go for buttons, later you go for big patches. Worst of all, I gotta pass without doing anything several times a game. The game plays me, not vice versa. 

For an abstract game you have very little options and you can barely call it strategic either.

RATING: 7.5
Two-players game very light, very neat, easy to explain and to play and with a very decent level of strategy. The focus of the game is to complete a 9x9 board with fabric of kind of Tetris pieces. One of the points of the game is to decide whether to try to be the first player in covering a 7x7 shape, probably leaving many empty spots on the board and being penalized for that, or trying to cover as much surface as possible.
Positive:
1. Easy to play
2. Quick to learn
3. Good level of strategy
4. Can be played for any type of player
Negative:
1. Only 2 player game
2. I am not sure about the replayability of the game

I was hoping for a little more ooomph to it from seeing some of the buzz, there is a little for sure and more than it seems at first blush but not really enough to get it fully out of filler territory for me (close!). I would likely choose Gric All Creatures most times over this for a 2 player 30 min game, or a pile of others but it should have enough to keep your interest with the spacial and engine aspects and then the movement and time track juggling and there is fairly good control with 2 players only. Theme is cute but wafer-thin. 

Sidenotes - Funny that POF experience was relevant here in the "Tetris" board building aspect. I was a little surprised that moving 3 spaces was not more expensive than moving 1 when buying things, it might have added a slight tactical element and point to ponder when making your moves. Also wondered why someone could NOT choose how many spaces to move when doing this for money on timetrack , instead they had to move enough to pass opponent (both of these might have been for simplicity or other reasons or combo of those)

Fun little tile laying game. This game is all about balancing the 3 currencies in the game: time, space and buttons. The player that best balances all 3 of these game aspects will win. One part of the game troubles me though, the 7x7 bonus does give a huge leap of advantage and I've seen players of almost equal skill lose due to that bonus.

Bokkensprong 16/10/15 met Sander en ik. Doel: elk op zijn eigen vierkante rasterbordje een patchwork maken van tetris-achtige stukken, en zo knopen (=geld=punten) verdienen. Er is een apart bordje met een tijdsspoor (wie laatst staat, is aan zet) waarop ook soms knopen worden uitbetaald of kleine stukjes leer te verdienen vallen als je ze passeert. De stukjes liggen uitgestald in een grote cirkel; de eerste drie na de pion zijn te koop voor tijdstappen + knopen. Extra knopen zijn te verdienen voor een volledig dicht patchwork. Knopen worden afgetrokken voor elk leeg rastervakje. Tof familiespelletje voor twee.

Gekregen voor 41e verjaardag van Anneken :)

Patchwork can be described as tactical, two-player, turn-based Tetris with two-currencies, time and money.

That description makes me drool.

Fortunately, the game delivers on this promise. My only complaint is that, while the game is easy to learn, it takes a few games to get good at putting the puzzle pieces together and understanding how to efficiently use the game's currencies. A veteran player will crush a new player, which might be a turn off for some (especially with a game of this complexity).

Got my wife to play it and she loved it! She said it was a keeper! YES!

I do like the "give and take" of opposing player control.  How do I buy multiple patches before given control over to my opponent?  When should I take money? Should I get this patch with buttons or the one that covers more space?

Lots of good tense decisions in this game.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (March 2015)

So far, I have liked every Rosenberg game I have played, but I was disappointed in Patchwork, I was expecting a heavier game from him.

The game is exceedingly simple with only two actions to choose from each turn, and in many turns you don’t have to choose which one to play because one action will be unavailable. I don’t like the theme, but it is a, somewhat, novel one. 

On the good side, the game is gorgeous and play very fast (its best feature). I think it can be a good family game.

Bottom line, I feel the game is very obvious and shallow but I could be wrong. I don’t mind playing light games but they have to offer interesting decisions and so far I haven’t seen them in Patchwork. I need to play it again to see if I’m wrong but for now I’m leaning towards getting rid of the game. My GF liked the game.

RATING: 10
The theme is one of a kind, and this is an excellent 2-player game! My partner keeps wanting to play it with me. It's got a Tetris vibe to it which I really appreciate. It is not easy to beat, as you have to try to get as many buttons as you can while trying to complete your patchwork - which is highly gratifying whether you win or lose. This is a definite must-have if you are looking for good 2-player games!

The rules are very simple while still creating a thoughtful and fun experience. It loses points for me because it's 2p only, which means I won't get a chance to play it very often. It's also a touch lighter than I would like.

[b]Time to pay the price[/b]
I love time tracks. I first encountered that mechanism in Thebes. It serves elegantly as both an action point system and a turn order track. Patchwork adds icons to the time track that when passed trigger income for the player passing them. The multi-use aspect of the track is very appealing and adds some decisions and tension to the game.

Maybe I haven't given this game enough of a chance, but when I ended up in the significant negative score at the end of the game, I thought I'd played incorrectly. The rules weren't specific enough for me to go there either. I guess I'm a millennial that needs to be told I'm special and a negative score doesn't exactly do that for me.

Edit: I played this again last night. I didn't score in negative and get the strategy of the game. I moved the rating up from 5 to 5.5 as a result, but overall still not a huge fan. I'll play if someone wants to play, but I'd never choose to play it. It's not really that exciting to me. Maybe it's just too simple of a game (although I do enjoy lost cities which is pretty simple). I think I need something more complex and strategic.

Brillant in its simplicity. The tradeoff decisions between buying an expensive tile now for higher payout later or a cheaper tile for more alternatives in the short term, weighing a positional advantage on the player board vs. the benefit of a needed patch and evaluating this vs. potentially leaving a good choice for your opponent are challenging and often non-trivial.

Patchwork even functions thematically despite its abstract nature. While it initially looks like Tetris, the puzzle part is the least important. Too bad that my girlfriend is annoyed after two massive defeats. Too much thought involved for casual enjoyment?

Wonderful, tetris-like quilt making game!!!  Interesting challenge to juggle the elements of each piece that affect its 'value':  ease of placement, how many spaces covered, button on the piece (income), cost in buttons, cost in time, as well as position in the circle (what pieces you leave available for your opponent).  Highly, highly recommend!!  Much to think about and very enjoyable.

The game probably "deserves" a rating of 8, but I simply don't really enjoy playing. I would only rate this a 6 as far as my personal interest, so I'm splitting the difference.

The magic of the game comes from the fact that although it is exceptionally simply to understand (which of 2-3 simple choices do you pick on your turn)... the depth of strategy is such that a very skilled player will beat you ever time, handily. I got destroyed my first few plays learning from someone experienced... then taught a new player how to play and proceeded to destroy him. I'm sure some of this was just chance, but the game plays as closer to chess than yahtzee.

Je ne suis pas un amateur de jeux à deux parce que je n'ai pas d'occasions, mais original et intéressant. 7/10.

While I like the tetris concept it's a little bit counterintuitive that not the person who builds the neatest wins but the person who has most buttons. The timing of the games seems to make it quite impossible to form a really neat rug. Also I'm wondering if there is enough strategy in there or if the only solid strategy is to get the patches that give you most income?

A mix between Tetris and an economic game. Perfect use of the time track mechanism, by linking it to income and having bonuses to the first to get to certain points. The "if you go here, I'll go there" which is the heart of good 2 player games is particularly interesting when players may take multiple turns in a row.

Very simple mechanics. Only 2 players, so it’s easy to set up as only one more willing person is needed. The theme is a bit juvenile. Good for kids, but I tried playing it with husband and it just felt too childish. I recommend it as a game to play with child though.

Kocyyyk! Bardzo lubię. Gra jest szybka, bardzo łatwa, można grać z osobami w starszym wieku, bo każdy raz dwa pojmie zasady. Miło się przy niej spędza czas, cała koncepcja jest bardzo fajna, te kafelki, guziczki. No supciutko :)

Nie spodziewałem się, że to będzie tak dobra gra dwuosobowa. Trochę Tetrisa, trochę planowania czy lepiej kupić coś drogiego i pozwolić przeciwnikowi na 2 ruchy, czy może rozegrać swoją kolejkę jakoś inaczej. Zdecydowanie częściej przegrywam niż wygrywam z M. ale i tak gra mi się podoba :) Na tyle, że zdecydowaliśmy się dokupić do niej fizyczne guziki, które zastąpiły kartonowe i dodały jeszcze więcej uroku temu tytułowi.

A good, ingenious, slightly cerebral, but unexciting economic game with a Tetris component. It’s easy to teach, set up and play. 

Each player has to accumulate buttons to spend on pieces that both fit into the Tetris shape and let them earn more buttons. At the same time, each player has to judge how best to manoeuvre on a timeline that contains additional bonus pieces. 

It’s a puzzle with three things to organise - trying to buy the most advantageous piece for yourself while denying your opponent too many good choices, fitting pieces together in an intelligent way, and advancing cleverly on a time-line. 

While there’s no conflict between the players, there’s also no social interaction. The exchanges during the game tend to be “I think I’ll buy this piece…” and that’s about it.

Cute little 2 player game. There is time and buttons which kinda act as money and trying to balance 2 different resources is really fun. The pull and push of the game feels really interactive. Also the theme is great to play with family members especially the older ones because they can relate to it. A relaxing and fun 2 player game that I recommend to couples and casual gamers. Sold after getting bored of it. The app is sufficient for us.

Excellent two-player game of buying Tetris-like pieces of patchwork to fit together on your grid to build as complete of a "quilt" as possible.  Managing button income and time spent on various pieces is where the interesting gameplay stems from.  The mechanism of the last player taking as many turns as they can/want until they pass the first player on the time track is also quite interesting.  Fun little abstract game that plays in about 15-20 minutes.

I bought this as a game to play with my girlfriend and I'm contemplating picking it up for my friend and his wife now. It's a fun 2 player game that takes about 20 minutes to play in my 2 game experience. I think of it as a resource management game mixed with Tetris. It's fun, quick, and requires planning. 

My one contention with it is it being $25-$30. It doesn't feel like it's worth that much in my opinion. I had issues with tearing when punching some pieces out. Word of advice, when pushing out the pieces, do so from the flat side. 

I wanted to give this a 7 based on the description of a 7 - Usually willing to play - but the price to quality value isn't there for me.

Rated 5 after one play:

tl;dr version: Very light game for casual gamers.

For any gamer, this is way too simple.  I watched two friends play and I feel like I had the optimal strategy down in a couple of minutes.

I then proceeded to destroy the previous winner (who had some experience playing the game) in my first match by a score of 34 to something like 10.  Now, she's a casual gamer, so I wasn't surprised, and here lies the problem.

If you play against another good player, I imagine that there can be a lot of very clever moves that you can do to screw your opponent over and/or set yourself up for future plays.  However, I can't imagine two gamers playing this game and having a ton of fun doing it.  I certainly can't.

Casual players might enjoy trying to fill up their boards the best they can, and scoring anywhere between -20 and +20 points.

But the real depth of the game comes from playing with gamers who will count everything, maximize their investments and set up future plays to get (or steal) the needed patches.

So it's either a (not very) deep game that gamers won't enjoy that much, or a game casual gamers might enjoy without experiencing its full potential.

Uwe fans are very likely to be disappointed.  The game is targeting a completely different audience, and while that's OK, this is information that's needed before purchasing the game.

---

After about 20 plays:

I kept playing at work (because we get down time in which there's little to do).  I enjoy the game quite a bit more, but not enough to play it outside of work.

There is quite a bit of challenge from setting up future plays that's quite enjoyable for me.  The game is still pretty light, but it's better than I originally thought. 

Counting the tiles' worth is annoying.  It's simple math, but it's quite repetitive.

Haven't played many abstract games but I enjoy this one. It plays like a more interactive Tetris as you are building a quilt of your own design. From building your quilt and earning more buttons as the game progress, it's all very satisfying to do. Each play has been different due to the random setup, which keeps the game fresh. A good, lightweight game for those interested in abstract games or a cozy theme.

I struggle a little bit to rate this one a 9 as I'm not sure it fully deserves its current spot as the #1 Abstract game.  To abstract game fans it likely isn't but it's immense draw comes from the rest of us who primarily play other types of games.  In that regard it is definitely one of our favorite abstracts in that it plays pretty quickly yet has very satisfying decision making.  I am a big fan of games that employ the time tracking game mechanic and this is likely a lot of people's first exposure to it (which may have resulted in the game being rated higher than it might otherwise have been, not sure).  I remember similar time mechanics in everything from Sun, Sea and Sand to FFG's Horus Heresy.  The way it is used in Patchwork is definitely NOT the most creative use of the mechanic however it may well be the BEST use of it in combination with the others as the whole game is basically more-or-less managing button income vs tetris like board space coverage vs cost in time.  Perhaps its best accomplishment though is in providing a filler level game that doesn't seem very random at all.  Still its not perfect and if I had to define its one point loss from a perfect 10 myself I would go with the one random element that is within the game which is the order the tiles are layed out in.  It can occur through no fault of the players that there are 3 extremely expensive tiles all in a row such that there is no valid move but for both players to pass and take 2 buttons each several turns in a row until one can afford one (This could even happen as a starting setup on turn 1).  There is another version of this where the game can stall out near the end because the next 3 tiles have no valid placement for either player even though scores of other tiles beyond those would be valid.  Fortunately neither situation happens which much frequency.  You could easily argue the theme is pasted on, but for the weight of the game I'd say it actually comes across pretty good and is likely part of the reason for its success vs. just having been red and blue pieces or something to that effect.  I've rarely given my wife games as presents in the past, but took a chance with this one.  Right now it is still her favorite game.

Great light game for two people. Combines making a puzzle (tetris like) with strategy. The main goal here is to collect the most buttons at the end of the game, but the catch: you will lose points for leaving spaces open on your board. Therefore you need to collect pieces (of cloth) which fit well on your board, but the pieces must also contain (lots of) buttons.

In Patchwork, two players compete to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 9x9 game board. To start play, lay out all of the patches at random in a circle and place a marker directly clockwise of the 2-1 patch. Each player takes five buttons — the currency/points in the game — and someone is chosen as the start player.

Is it novel as many users state? No, it isn't, it's more like Uwe Rosenberg (the designer of some famous games where you buy tiles to place them on your personal boards to produce and also to cover negative scoring spaces) reworking Reiner Knizia in his style.
Is it a problem? Oh no, it isn't. It's a fine game; I must admit the result is more interesting than those Knizias. And the Patchwork look and 'theme' is really fun.

RATING: 7.5
[2016.Feb.29] This short, 2-player puzzle-like abstract is easily approachable by both gamers and non-gamers alike. With only 2 possible actions each player turn, there's not much heavy thinking required. The trickiest part is deciding how to place your acquired puzzle... er, I mean quilt piece. It is a nice addition to almost any collection. I hope your [i]Patchwork[/i] quilt isn't as moth-eaten as mine typically turn out to be.

WOW! Ptchwork is so much fun! The only thing I don't like are the negative points "you start with", I find them anticlimactic (I mean, it can happened that you won with -4 to your's opponent -6...). Other than that (which is mostly a feeling, and has nothing to do with the game-play itself) I love this game.

RATING: 7
Ein reines 2-Personen Spiel, wenn sich die Gelegenheit mal ergibt ;).
Im Kreis liegen Flicken aus, die wir in unseren Teppich einbauen möchten. Wer an der Reihe ist nimmt sich eines der drei nächsten Flicken, näht es in seinen Flickenteppich ein und bezahlt Knöpfe und Zeit auf einer Zeitleiste. Es ist immer derjenige Spieler dran, der bis dato weniger Zeit ausgegeben hat, somit können multiple Züge entstehen, wenn ein Spieler sehr "Zeitteure" Plättchen erwirbt und der andere dagegen "günstige". Auf dieser Zeitleiste gibt es immer wieder einzelne Bereiche, die beim Überschreiten eine Knöpfe-Ausschüttung hervorrufen. Die sind zwingend notwendig um flüssig zu bleiben, denn wer zu wenig Knöpfe hat muss "aussetzten" und erhält dadurch ein paar Knöpfe, verschenkt aber seinen Zug. Sobald die Zeitsteine das Ende des Tracks erreichen endet das Spiel und wer jetzt mehr Knöpfe hat gewinnt.
Mir hat das Spiel in den ersten Partien nur mäßig gefallen, es wurde aber mit der Zeit immer besser, bis ich es mir sogar selbst gekauft habe. Jetzt spiele ich es sehr gerne.

[b]Patchwork is a thoughtful puzzler of acquiring and placing tiles stitched together with a delightfully approachable theme.[/b]
r{[i]I found this game to be surprisingly good, so much so that I bought it immediately after having played it once.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Two players race to efficiently piece together a quilt with Tetris-like patch work shapes purchased using buttons as currency which are acquired over time. Quilts are judged for missing patches with poor results subtracting from one's score of accumulated buttons.

COMMENTS
Rosenberg's game excels at what he sets out to do with his design which is first to create a tight resource market in acquiring pieces of patchwork and second to force you to solve a spatial puzzle in placing your pieces to shape a quilt.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ It's a bit of a brain burner that I admire for how well it plays.
+ Simple and easily understood rules paired with a clever button acquisition and time keeping main board make for a (dare I say it) elegant game.
* Simple oval set up of patch work pieces nicely accommodates their loose storage in box.

Rosenberg is best known for games in which you have to build a farm by first gathering enough quanta to assemble an atom, then making atoms into elements, and so on, until you have a pig or a rock. But once he made games like Bohnanza and Klunker. 

Patchwork is a game that can be as casual or cutthroat as you want (within reason -- it's not Diplomacy or anything). At first it seems like you don't have enough buttons to even make decisions, but before long you have options to weigh, and can even get tricky about it. A good time, and a welcome change of pace.

This fascinating little two-player game is evidence of the conceptual genius of Uwe Rosenberg.  On its face, it’s an abstract strategy game about making a patchwork quilt, but the hook here is that it’s really about five games in one:  strategy, time track, puzzle game, resource management, and tile placement are all represented in Patchwork to one degree or another.  There’s even a bit of card-counting/spatial relations.  What’s amazing is that it all works!

A cute theme (and another non-violent one, for those of you who care) and decent artwork, though nothing will blow you away. It’s a small thing, but the one big headache is that at the start of the game, the patch pieces take up a ton of space.  Otherwise, it’s a remarkably competitive, surprisingly tense game.

RATING: 10
Probably the best 2-player game I've come across yet.  In a basic sense, I would describe it as Tetris the board game, though it goes beyond that.  Yes, you have normal bisymmetrical shapes (quilt patterns) to lay out on your quilt (your board) but you also have these oblong shapes/patterns that can really mess things up for you.  Using buttons as currency to purchase the quilt patterns, there is a fun strategy involved of not overspending, making sure you don't advance too far, too fast on the time track and also making sure you don't place your patterns in such a way where you paint yourself into a corner.  I absolutely love this very clever game.

Although I don't really relate to the theme of this game, the game itself is fun. It's a simple puzzle and strategy game. I enjoy it a lot more than I thought I would.

The rules are very simple. My wife and I learned AND played through our first game in a total of 45 minutes.

Requires a little more table space than you would anticipate since all of the unused "patches" are initially placed in a circle around the time board. Although, you could get creative and place the unused patches any way you like.

RATING: 7
Tetris with an economic engine, this game has a very simple ruleset yet is quite brain-burny. Since you use almost all the tiles every game this rating is a bit tentative as I am unsure of its replayability, but it is quite possible that the order of the tiles matter a lot and a master of this game could potentially chain tile combinations to perfectly fill up their board without empty spaces in between. Also it appears to be pretty important to make sure you choose tiles so that you cross the button icons; otherwise you will be stuck with no buttons to buy tiles on your subsequent turns.

A simple two player game where you have a series of tetris-like shapes played out in circle.  You can buy one of the next 1 to 3 of them or gain buttons by moving one past your opponent.  The object is to fill up a 9x9 grid and gain as many buttons as you can.  Any unfilled spaces reduce your button count.  Buttons are money and victory points.  The game is much deeper than it appears on the surface but plays quickly and I find it very fun.  Very family friendly and good for kids and adults.  Uwe Rosenberg is brilliant.

While I'd had great hopes that [b][thing=163412][/thing][/b] would be a hit with both my wife and I, after two plays, we gave up on it.  I'm sure the decision-making in this game can get quite agonizing if one gives themselves enough time to plot out multiple turns and anticipate the other player's moves as well. But as my wife plays fast and loose (and I have to play at her pace), the game doesn't really pull us in.  And for me, [b][thing=163412][/thing][/b] is also just a little too abstract for my liking.

A fun diversion, even though the pieces are not cut straight. I'll get after them with a hobby knife, I think.

Great 2 player game with very nice artwork and color choices. 
Perfect game to introduce people to modern games.

In essence it's a smart puzzle game, but it's much more than just puzzling. One of the few pleasant surprises at Spiel 2014.

First thoughts:  an overly hasty play showed our lack of foresight; we ended up with three turns at the end that did not involve any building.  

Can't beat the art and the design.  Excellent decisions between buying a piece for the quilt and gathering more buttons.

Slight engine building for button income.  

Lots of promise.  Initial rating:  7.

Update:  Lots of great decisions.  

Rating moved to 9.

There's a wealth of decisions generated from a quirky mixture of Tetris and a very basic economy engine, and on top you get an excellent graphics implementation of the 'theme', for lack of a better word - shiny buttons, bright patterns on your quilt pieces, and non-intrusive game information.

After a single play, it's hard to judge the depth of any game, but I suspect that Patchwork has quite a lot of planning to offer once you start to pay attention to the needs of your opponent as well as to your own. Never thought I would consider adding another two-player abstract to our collection, but this one surely has me tempted ...

RATING: 8
I'm not usually into these puzzle type games, especially ones taking inspiration from Tetris.  However, I cannot deny a well-designed game.  The game has a very clever balancing act between gaining currency and buying pieces to put your quilt.  It's all about being efficient on your turns with plenty of tactical decisions to make.

I wouldn't own this in my collection because, as I stated, I'm not into puzzle games.  This doesn't mean it's a bad game though.  I highly recommend this two player game or at least, give it a shot when the opportunity arises.

Nifty little two-player game, a theme I've never seen before (quilting), and some really interesting "double economies": You spend your victory points to do things, and time is also a currency.﻿

It's pleasant to play. That's not damning it with faint praise: It's a genuinely pleasant experience, somehow relaxing despite the fact that every turn is full of tough decisions.

It has an interesting rhythm to it, too, with the pace depending on a wide range of variables that change every turn.

Rating based on 2 players.

Easy to play (one of the few games my mom actually will!), but can be surprisingly thinky. Despite it being a perfect information game, your choices are limited enough that there is little chance of AP... but the choices are not always easy to make, and you have to think ahead. You are not so much aggressive in this game as passive-aggressive.

Some people may find the theme boring but I think it's a nice change of pace, plus there's a nice feeling of satisfaction in creating as complete a quilt as possible.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
In a span of a few weeks, this game has climbed the ranks of becoming a favorite game for my wife and I. The title of a "couple's game" is really easy to bestow on it, especially with the theme, but really, anyone two people could play it. The sewing theme is just flavor. There's just enough decision making, and the ramping up that is done at the end is just spectacular. The obvious component upgrade is to get some real-life buttons to use as currency in place of the cardboard chits. Once you've gotten a few games under your belt, check out the strategy article that talks about button rates to take your game to the next level.

A tetras tile game, where players buy tiles to fill in a quilt pattern. As you add tiles you advance in "time" on a board. Passing spaces gives you buttons, to buy more tiles. Whoever covers the most space and generates the most buttons wins. Game is simple but fun!

Cons:

Overall: An instant classic. The only thing holding this game back is its cover. Honestly, I wasn't interested in it because it just didn't look interesting. I'm sure glad I gave it a chance. It's sooooo good.

RATING: 8
I was skeptical at first. I hate tetris, and quilting is for girls...But after i set my pride aside and played this game, this game is incredible. I love the engine building mechanic of buying the pieces that produce more buttons for you when you hit a scoring round. Bonus patches if you're the first to reach a spot on the time track are awesome. But you have to weigh that with taking your time and buying the pieces that give you the most for your money, and really utilizing the time track to your advantage. Sometimes being behind the other player is better so you can string together a combo of good pieces. Quite a nice balance between getting the button pieces that subsequently speed you along on the time track faster than you'd like, with buying the value pieces that fill up your quilt more. Great balance. I like how the token skips pieces and works its way back around in a circle. Put your pride away and give this game a try, it's incredible. My new favorite two player game.

FUN: the rules are extremely simple, but it's a really interesting puzzle to choose between time and income for your pieces AND at the same time take into account what options you leave your opponent with.

Don't let the twee look fool you, this is real Uwe game here. The rules are very nice and simple but the actual gameplay is NOT for casual players unless you're looking for "next step".

Xmas 2016. Pretty, fast game that has been won every time by the person getting the 7x7 prize. Probably due to everyone cottoning on fast to the idea that getting a button engine underway early is important.

Very simple game you can play almost right away. 

Trying to fit every patch on your board, getting that 7x7 patchwork bonus, trying to hamper the opponent in getting certainpieces, optimising your time and button-income and trying to get multiple turns before the other goes again. Trying to be on top of your opponent on the time-track is a very powerful move.

Need to play it more, but I like it already after the first play.

With promo: real buttons and neutral 'pawn'.

Edit: great 'filler' type of game with a jigsaw puzzle mechanic. It's a very attractive game with the right theme and short playing time. The 7x7 bonus isn't Always necessary. Try to go for big tiles with lots of buttons! And mind the end of the time track: goign to fast will net you a lot of holes in your patchwork!

I really love this adorable game.

Edit2: one minor thing. The only incentive to make a 'beautiful' patchwork is the 7x7 tile. If you manage to make a much larger block (which is quite a feat), it isn't rewarded. Trying to fit in the 'best' piece (and then probably leaving some open spaces) rewards more points.

Seems nice and colorful enough for a quick filler for two, but on lots of turns there just aren't any decisions to make, since you can't afford any of the 3 tiles coming up next. So you just waste some more of that precariously short time track. It's also key to gather as many tiles with buttons on them ASAP, which might also be impossible. Your opponent can sometimes really block you in a bad way. We're constantly finishing with high negative scores so I guess we either still suck at it or it can't be avoided.

It was very easy to learn and teach this game. Me and my sister-in-law could play it straightaway. It was a great fun to getting complete the board with different shapes and playing with buttons on the way. Definitely more to play.

RATING: 8
A game about buying and placing patches. A patch is a polyomino - it has a size (squares covered), a shape (a square, a line, a cube, a wierd looking thing), two costs (price and time), and a income value (represented by the number of buttons on the tile). On purchase you pay, take and place the patch on your personal "Quilt", then move your marker, and if you're still behind your opposition you get to go again. A true combinatorial game - everything is visible from the get go, but the feel is completely different to what those games typically tend to give.

Turns out juggling tetris pieces in your head, trying to craft a plan for your next couple of moves, knowing your opponent is doing the same and also trying to do the best to screw you, is bloody hard! In a great fun and tense way that allows you to feel so clever when you get it right, and the "Oh bloody hell..." dismay and frustration when you realise that no, those two don't fit there, and no, you didn't have enough to purchase that so now you have to pass.

Excellent and tight. It's a game you can grow with, and I feel that the strategic space opens up one level of understanding at the time - you start considering not just your own board, but really more your opponents. It's not just both players building their patch in peace and quiet, no it's both players trying to scrape together a patch while your opponent is out with scissors trying to cut yours up and you are trying to set his/hers on fire.

My verdict: Easy to get to the table and a great couple game, or just a great game for anyone really!

Love the tetris concept combined with engine (money income) building as well as the cost of the tiles (combination of money and time). The time concept is also brilliant and fits well with the time. Some tiles feel unbalanced.
Main critique point is that most often, the last few turns feel very anti climatic as it doesn't pay off to buy tiles, so people just skip and hope that their money is more at the end. Doesn't hurt too much as it is quite quick playing. Just enough strategy for a light game.

Es un juego estratégicamente sólido que mezcla planificación estratégica con decisiones muy tácticas. Además, una de las cosas que más me gusta es el reto para una competencia que otros no tiene en cuenta, que es la visión espacial.

No puedo ponerle dentro de mi grupo de notable alto o sobresaliente senciallamente porque no deja de ser muy abstracto, aunque muy bonito de componentes.

This is a really neat two player game. You are working to make a quilt by buying tetris-inspired swatch pieces. Each piece costs some kind of combination of time and buttons, for each time it costs the player moves their marker along the track, and whoever is furthest behind gets to play next. Each time a marker crosses a button, the player receives an income of buttons according to how many buttons are on their quilt at the time, each time a player passes they receive a button for each space they have to move along the time track, and whenever a player piece passes one of the single square swatch pieces on the track, they immediately adds it to their quilt. The game ends when both players reach the end of the time track, and they score according to the amount of buttons they have earned, deduct two points for each open space in their quilt and if the player managed to earn the 7x7 bonus tile for being the first to complete a 7x7 grid on their quilt they earn another 7 bonus points.

This is a simple to teach, but also highly strategic game, really recommend it.

Excellent 2-Player game.  It has a simple rule set, plays in a short amount of time, and it has a surprising amount of depth given these parameters.

This is an abstract game, but the theme actually comes through and elevates the game.  I don't generally like abstracts, but this game is a major exception.

Lots of nuance here and a lot to like.  From a design perspective, this game is pretty astounding.

Really nice little game in a small box, making it pretty transportable. Just enough depth to keep it interesting, while light enough not to be a huge challenge. The only downside is the aesthetics... the colours and patterns could be much prettier, but that's the fabric buff in me speaking. :)

Got this to play with wife and extended family. Bought this for the memorial week family reunion and this easily got the most plays (even more than cribbage, which is saying something with a card playing family). My mother and older sister played it 5 times while we watched a movie. It was quick enough that people watching it played could call "next" and get in a game. It is also easy enough that anyone watching it being played would pick it up. It has enough luck to keep anyone competitive but strategic enough to make you feel you control your own fate.

Update: This is one of my go to games to bring to things. It is guaranteed to get played. My mother-in-law actually borrows it every other week to play with her friends and husband. Will have to get her a copy.

Update 2.0: Got mother in law a copy for Christmas. Now I can keep my copy at the house. This game is quick enough that it sees lots of play and simple enough that it can be taught to anyone. Really enjoy it.

Update 3.0: I think the reason this has so much staying power for me, is that it is one of the few games that I can play with anyone of any skill level and still enjoy the game. Most games that are friendly to non-gamers aren't very enjoyable for me.

Cannot say enough about how impressed I am with this great 2-player!  Plenty of depth and hard decisions that encourage you to think many turns in advance, also forcing you to consider what you may be leaving for your opponent.  Yet the gameplay is so simple and light, easy to teach.  One of my wife's favorites (and mine if I'm looking for a shorter game)!  It's pretty quick, and a small package to boot!  A very non-threatening, relaxed, but still fulfilling gaming experience. Top-notch!  Only thing keeping me from rating it higher is for such a small game, the initial set-up takes up more room than you'd expect on a table.  But it gets smaller as the game goes on.  Not a big issue by any means, and it really isn't that much room.  And we'll see how much longevity it has (but I think that it'll last us quite a long time).

Kvázi egy modern tetrisz, egyedi szabályokkal. Kifejezetten érdekes, hogy nem csak az ár, hanem az idő is tényező a foltok varrásánál, ami miatt még jobban lehet benne taktikázni.

A játék végén elég erős a bevarratlan mezők utáni 2 pont levonás mezőnként, simán lehet 0 pont alá is menni emiatt.

Csak két játékos játszhatja (van mondjuk nem hivatalos "szóló" mód is), amit mondjuk lehetett volna akár 3-4-re is növelni több folttal és plusz játékos táblákkal. Igaz, akkor a foltok már nem biztos, hogy elférnének egy átlagos méretű asztalon...

Mivel túl sok interakció nincs a két játékos között (konkrétan csak annyi, hogy a kinézett foltot elveheti előlünk az ellenfél, ha ő van körön), ezért egyedül ez hozható fel neki még negatívumnak.

Egyébként szórakoztató, könnyed taktikai játék, egyszerű szabályokkal, belépő szintnek tökéletes, minőségi játékelemekkel.

UPDATE: Megvettem az android appját is, az esseni akcióban. Kiválóan megcsinálták, visszaadja a játék hangulatát, jól kezelhető és online játék mellett van lehetőség AI ellen is játszani (legnehezebb ellenfél ellen kifejezetten esélytelen nyerni).

RATING: 7
An amazingly fun game to play. By far the most richly rewarding 2-player filler game I've played. Beautiful in its simplicity, but with a surprising amount of depth, although I suspect that will diminish somewhat after more plays. 

I bought this specifically to play with my wife, hoping it would provide something a little deeper and more engaging than just going through the motions of yet another play of Ticket To Ride, Qwirkle, or Lost Cities. We've been badly in need of a game to bridge the gap between my desire for something deeper and less samey than the above-mentioned games, and her distaste for long, complex games. Patchwork is (at least for now) the perfect compromise.

Update: Downgraded from 9 to 7. It's still a good game, but once you work out the formula for figuring out which tiles give the biggest bang for the buck (in terms of both time and buttons) and you start to memorize which tiles are good and which are bad, then the game gets a lot less interesting, and the choices become more obvious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An underwhelming game from my favorite designer.  There are 3 things to consider: getting buttons, filling spaces and managing time.  None of these things is really at odds with any other, so there is very little tension.  As one of your first few moves, you may need to advance on the time track to get an injection of buttons, but after that you always want to buy swatches:  so almost all of the game consists of picking one of the 3 available swatches.  Which one do you pick?  (1) The one with the most buttons, (2) The biggest, (3) The one you can afford.  You repeat this simple heuristic for the whole game.

Very nice filler for two with super-simple rules and yet tricky enough. The game feels it's cut very short by the time track, but that's probably by design, to make the scoring tight.
Nice theme that is not represented in board games very much and doesn't even feel too much pasted on. The compononets could have been real buttons and a spool instead of general wooden figure, but that's something a local purchase in dressmaker-shop can fix. :)

Patchwork von Uwe Rosenberg ist ein eingängiges 2-Personen Spiel mit einem sehr ungewöhnlichen Thema. Die Spieler versuchen aus Stoffteilen einen hübschen Flickenteppich anzufertigen. Die Spielmechanik ist so genial wie simpel: Alle Stoffflicken werden in einem großen Kreis angeordnet. An einer bestimmten Stelle, steht ein Meeple und nur die 3 Flicken, die vor dem Meeple liegen, dürfen erworben werden. Zahlen müssen die Spieler mit Knöpfen und Zeit und so rücken sie auf dem kleinen Spielbrett, mehrere Felder nach vorne.

RATING: 7
Fun. Easy to learn and teach, but it also involves more thinking than the title and theme might indicate. Quick to play and good variety each time, with the "patches" placed randomly and the related changes in each play of the game. Small box makes it good to take on a trip, although the set up requires a decent amount of table space, so you won't be playing it on the plane or in a car, really.

Puntos fuertes: Fácil de aprender, es un juego de dos muy entretenido y sesudo. Es más profundo de lo que parece.

Puntos débiles: Aquí, igual que en muchos juegos de Maldito Games, la caja no le hace ninguna justicia al juego. Requiere mucho espacio en mesa.

Conclusión: Nosotros compramos este juego por la "insistencia social" ya que no nos llamaba nada la atención ni la caja, ni las ilustraciones ni en sí la temática. Después de jugarlo hay que reconocer que el juego está muy medido y bien hilado (tututum). 100% recomendable.

Probably the most elegant 2-player game I've played. Rules are simple but there is a lot you can strategize. Good players definitely fill their boards more often than new players. What I have also found out, this game is great with players who don't normally play boardgames. Patchwork can be played completely ignoring your opponent which is easier for a newer player. However, good player can do a lot of thinking ahead according to your opponents moves.

Patchwork also has a very elegant time mechanic which I simply love. It feels natural after a while and it is a new and thematic mechanic. 

Overall, a great 2-player game. There is also very good mobile version of this game which includes asymmetric online play.

Video Review - https://youtu.be/sE3FwDcEzpg

Patchwork is a two player tile laying game based around making your own quilt. But don't let the theme put your off. This is an excellent quick game with plenty of decisions to make. Players are seeking to finish the game with the least gaps in their quilt (-2 for each one) and the most buttons (1 for each one) in their collection. They achieve this by using buttons to buy patches which they place on their quilt but also cause their counter to move further along the time track. It is a real balance between moving and cost as sometimes you won't want to move that far as it gives your opponent more choice. At various points you earn more buttons or a single square patch, and there is also a bonus if you are first to make a 7 by 7 square. Turns are not taken in order but instead the player furthest behind on the time track plays next. This gives you an opportunity to chain moves together. On your turn you can buy and play a patch, or move in front of the other player taking an amount of buttons for the spaces moved. Brilliant and simple.

RATING: 7
Very impressed by this game. Has a very easy barrier to entry, but the ceiling for doing well is very, very high. Games of this are tense, and every move you make could make or break the game for you. It's kind of an oddity, because while the rules are extremely simple, the amount of thought needed to play well at this game is far above what you'd expect a 2-player filler game to have. I'm not normally a fan of Rosenburg's games, but this one was a pleasant surprise for me. I couldn't care less about the theme, but the gameplay is solid, fun, and addictive.

UPDATE: I've lowered my rating slightly due to burnout. The game is still fun, but I'm not sure there is a ton left to explore for me personally.

Patchwork plays like a beautiful blend of Tetris and Euro resource management. On one hand, you need to plan your economy, so that you have a steady income to purchase tiles for. On the other hand, you need to plan your board so that the pieces fit without holes.

To accomplish this, Uwe has blended some simple mechanics into an excellent whole where no decision is given. Do you want to advance slowly on the tile track to buy as many big tiles as possible or fast to pick up those small free tiles awarded to the first to reach them? Is it better to choose a good tile for yourself or leave a bad tile for your opponent? And what is a "good tile" given that you have to consider its shape, cost, time and future income?

My only concern is that the opening moves can be forced if most of the early tiles are too expensive but it may also be because I don't handle the opening well yet.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I'm skeptical of reviews, especially when they all say the same thing: "High intensity" on a quilting game?! But then I tried it. Dude. Duuuuuuude. That is some high intensity gameplay. We actually had to devise a "quilt bag" from which to draw the tiles and use a d20 to randomize which the actual start tile would be, counting *from* the smallest/start marker, to avoid any appearance of loading advantage. For such a simple-looking game (like, I was thinking, how hard is Tetris when you don't have to insert blocks on a timer, really?) it actually has several strategy routes, none of which appear to work all the way through, so you have to improvise and combine; you want to cover all your squares, but you need buttons to get pieces, but neither of these per-piece qualities are linked to the time factor, so the decision tree rapidly turns into a decision graphing calculator if you're a competitive freak like me, or just a delightful smorgasbord of possibilities with the occasional gotcha or big cash-in if you're playing it as a lighter weight game. Perfect for two whiling away an afternoon or for one gamer to draw one normal over to the cardboard side; Rosenberg knocks this one out of the park.

This tile laying game is OK, but not one I would hurry to play again. Not really sure why it didn't grab me as I usually enjoy these types of games. I found it unexciting, perhaps it's the theme... My opponent quite liked the game.

This is a lovely little head-to-head game about making a quilt. It's almost too twee to get on board with at first; you use buttons for currency and try not to have any holes in your blanket. I mean... really. But there is something wonderfully nice about this game. The 'catch-up' mechanic does a good job of keeping the game competitive (it's very hard for a clear winner to emerge until the end) and it's a solid little mix-up of resource management and planning. Designed specifically for two players, it's a very simple game which can be learned quickly and definitely worth the twenty minutes it takes to play. It's just... so... twee.

Vraiment très agréable comme jeu à 2. Des parties rapides (moins de 30min). On doit construire son quilt avec des morceaux de tissus. Certes le thème est étrange mais bien rendu. Un casse tête pour que les moreceaux s'emboitenet, une 'course' pour avoir les pieces de cuir qui comblent les trous, une gestion du temps pour ne pas laisser les meilleurs morceaux a l'autre et avancer trop vite.

A very tight, tetris-like game in which pieces cost you both time and money. Almost every decision is difficult as you try to buy the right pieces to fit together, pace your game and earn buttons along the way. I love the concept and art. Definitely a very unique game in both style and substance.

For a Tetris-loving, board-gaming couple, this game hits the sweet spot. We liked it so much we played it two more times after trying it for the first time.

The tiles are fun, much more colourful than the box art leads to believe, and creating your quilt is satisfying to behold. The time track and movement mechanics and the punishing scoring (we only had one win end in positive numbers) give what would otherwise have been a light game some depth.

Always enjoy playing this. Unique mechanic for taking patches. Feels like there are a few different ways tooptimise your strategy, requiring multiple plays to reveal and test. Possibly a little too much weight given to the bonus for being first with 7x7, my wife would probably enjoy this a little more if it was about achieving a 'personal best' over competitive play.

Great 2-player game, nice and simple in a small box.  Quick to learn and play with endless possibilities.  I bought a cheaper Greek version because there are no words on the pieces and you can download the simple rules by Googling for a PDF.  4-player variant by the same designer is Cottage Garden.

You basically pay for tetris pieces to fit on your own grid with each piece either: costing a lot, or moving you forward a lot, or having many buttons that earn you points.  There don't seem to be large pieces with point scoring buttons on that move you on 1 or 2 spaces and cost little, but it does make you wonder if there is a rough formula to follow - I tend not to pay much more than 3 1/2 per button and avoid big moves.

Played the app a few times and was more enjoyable than I expected, so would like to get a copy physically to try out with friends. The complexity but repetitive fun reminds me of Splendor a bit, and theres more to think and plan of than I expected, and its harder to do well than I had thought it would be.

Another small issue is probably the skill gap. I suspect Id hold the advantage for knowing and having played this a few times, and this may not be as fun for other beginners? Or maybe Im wrong and theyd get used to it quick and catch up.

Plays: 20+

Got tired of it and not enough meat on the bone and hard to plan without spendin large amounts of time.

I'm gonna be honest I did not like this game at all the first few times we played it. I found the game to be way too casual, a bit boring and some aspects of the game very very pointless, so Patchwork just gathered dust on my little shelf. I never understood why this game was so popular. I came to a point where I started looking for possible trades. One day I decided to take this game out and give it another chance. We looked at the rules again and realised we have played it completely wrong before. We opened up Netflix on the side and casually played the game while rewatching Friends. Perfect. Absolutely brilliant gameplay! I now love Patchwork and understand why everyone does as well. We find it to be the perfect casual game to whip out for a light chill evening. It is not very competitive as you have your own little game in front of you (to neatly pack every tile you buy) and even better Zeynep doesn't mind losing at all in this. Very fun indeed.

Note: This game has been played several times before I started logging plays.

I think there is a little more randomness, or at least unpredictability, here than some people have suggested--the first few buys feel pretty impactful, so the random setup and the initial turn order can make a significant difference in the way the rest of the game plays out.  If you make it into the midgame in rough equilibrium with your opponent, then the luck element does disappear.  Regardless, it's a fun abstract game which plays fast and has a lot of depth relatively to its low entry barrier.

It's an unlikely and unexpected design from Uwe Rosenberg, who had been publishing much heavier games and very recently put a 2-player one in the market. The graphic design is attractive, but the theme is non existant.

It's an brilliantly designed medium to light abstract tactic game. It posseses many virtues: simple rules, almost no setup, fast gameplay, thoughtful decisions, elegant, includes some innovations, short...

Simple and deceptively strategic two player game with a fun theme.  It's fun trying to balance getting more buttons, buying pieces for your board, and monitoring how your actions may give an advantage to your opponent.

RATING: 7.5
Gioco semplice, veloce ma anche strategico. Piacevolissima sfida a due giocatori, apparentemente in solitario, si lavora sulla propria tela, in realtà offre interazioni continue dal rubarsi i tessuti, alla caccia delle toppe, alla poca perdita di tempo, all'impossibilità di muoversi e quindi fare punti bottone. Dopo essersi ripetuto con Agricola e tutto quello che poteva derivarne, finalmente, Uwe Rosenberg presenta qualche cosa di originale e molto godibile. Promosso a pieni voto, ho solo il rammarico di non averlo provato e acquistato subito ad Essen pensando fosse un giochino stupido, errore!

Only two plays, but those two were fun. The game has interesting mechanics and the strategy, although maybe not the deepest, does make for variations in game play. It was quick to learn, simple to play and not stressful at all.

Uwe Rosenberg should stick to tight, clever 2-player games like this rather than making increasingly languid and sprawling exercises in agricultural worker-placement economy. Patchwork is attractive, intelligent, tactile and very VERY difficult to play well. You'd think we could have our fill of Tetris-like board-fillers, but this one doesn't give any signs that the genre is old.

A pretty light but charming 2 player game. I'd probably describe it as a jugsaw puzzle for 2 with scoring. 

I very much like the look of it at the end of the game and charming is really what comes to mind with this. 

I'm not really sure if the 7x7 bonus is not a little too powerful but otherwise this is for me already quiet up there with some of the classic 2 player light filler games.

The gameplay ist simple and still offer a lot of choices. I really like how you sometimes have to make the choice between spending more time but less buttons for a piece or less time but more buttons. Also there is the (little) tension when you really hope your opponent doesn't take that one piece that would fit perfectly in your grid but you couldn't afford befor. 

In addition this game is really beautiful and of some of the pieces I even wish I had some real fabric with that pattern for my quilts. 

For the buttons I made a little origami box, which stores them neatly.

[b]Patchwork[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]This has been a tough game for me to get get a handle on. While 14 plays may seem like a lot, Patchwork lost some steam as the months rolled on. This game continues to be punishing, especially if you haven't played for a while. I don't mind that though, I always enjoy figuring out how I can actually come out of the game on the + side of the point column. I think it really just comes down to the fact that when I'm picking a quick 2p game I gravitate towards card games. Patchwork is definitely a game I'd recommend and will still continue to get play, just not as much as my family's favorite card games. That said it is still an excellent game and it's actually a punishing Uwe design, which we are seeing less and less of.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Excellent family game that sets up and plays quick, meaning it will hit the table a lot.
- One of the most beautiful games I own, I love the patterns for the quilt pieces.
- Buttons are both your score and income, which really makes this game extremely tense.
- Time track, I love games that use this mechanic, part of your planning has to take into account how many turns in a row you may get or give to the other player.[/i]

Update

Played one game with wife. Not really enamored by the gameplay but I think she is. Hate that we can't hold the pieces and rearrange them later. Some of the big pieces are really hard to place later in the game. Will play more times with wife to decide if it's something I will always want to play

~


Based on first impression with 6 year old.

Liked the fact that one has to look forward to determine what pieces can fit into one's board while balancing button balance, button income and opportunity for the one-square tiles.

Need to play with my wife to ascertain its staying power though

I am NOT good at this game.  My brain wants to fill in all available space, and from what I've seen, that might not be a viable approach.  If I end up in positive territory, it's only by a few buttons.  And yet I've seen some serious scoring that can happen.  So, I'll play, and I do think there's a good game there, I just can't grok a good strategy so it's kind of hard for me to like.

So overhyped it's ridiculous. Can think of 20 much superior two player games I'd rather play.   Good filler for when you are really tired and do not want to think at all.  But then I would rather watch TV than play this. Decisions are simple and obvious.  Maybe it's good for fans of Tetris?  I am not a fan of Tetris.  Uwe has a hard time with his games. They are either overly complicated or incredibly simple. This is the mcdonald's of fillers. It's popularity is depressing.  I wish I had burned it instead of selling it.  That would have given me more satisfaction.

The first time I heard my Wife ordering me (multiple times): "Wait. Wait. I need time to think".

In EVERY other game, when a difficult situation arises, she is like: "Oh whatever, I'll do this. I don't want to think all day in order to make a move"

Something is really done right with this game.

A bit on the girlish - peacefull side,more suitable for couples. I prefer it over Jaipur and Lost Cities.

I must admit I am not a fan of Uwe but this one is a true gem that deserves (to some extent)the praise it gets. 

... I also must confess that I thought this was the ugliest game I ever saw in the top 500. It is actually a pleassure to look at.

* Be warned: It takes a lot of space to set up the game. I prefer playing it on the carpet.

This is a good 2-player filler. it takes 2 minutes to learn, and still gives some strategic depth. 

I am good at pattern recognition and puzzle laying, which helps me a little to get the pieces together without mistakes which lets me concentrate on strategic choices. 

After two tries: first game I won with a 40p margin, second with even more!

The secret is to get the pieces with many buttons, and always have enough buttons to afford to buy a piece. Dont be afraid to spend time!

A beautiful, amazing game.  The tension between button costs and time costs is fantastic, the way turns work is amazing, and... basically, everything about this game is great.  It's appealing on an aesthetic level and it's appealing on a nerdy bin-packing uber-Tetris level.  I love that there's nothing random after the opening setup, too.

Patchwork is a 2-player light filler game in which players are drafting tetris-like patch pieces and trying to fill up their 9x9 grid board. The patch tiles are arranged in a circle around the time track board, along with a pawn that both players use--players can take a tile that’s one to three spaces ahead of the pawn, and then replace the tile they took with the pawn. The tiles have two costs, time and buttons. The time works like Around the World in 80 Days or Thebes; whoever has accumulated the least total time takes the next turn. Buttons introduce a tiny economic element into the game--patch tiles have between zero and three button icons on them, and whenever a player passes a button on the time track, that player receives buttons equal to the number he’s placed on his grid board. There’s a bonus for the first player to fill up a 7x7 area on his grid, but other than that, scoring is just the number of buttons the player has left, minus the spaces on his grid board he didn’t fill. This is a perfectly acceptable filler, but it didn’t really stand out to me.

What a brilliant game. It's a puzzle, an economic engine and an action management system all rolled into one. You have only a small handful of rules to the game and yet it's quite deep. I'm absolutely blown away by it's simplicity. I seem to be doing better in it than I was initially.

I worry this is not something that's going to get to the table though. I thought this was the perfect game for the girlfriend, but I've now smoked her 3 times in it and she is really hesitant to play it more. :(

Own Jun/17: good game.  Rule book has a few gaps (which online posters say are 'obvious', but they aren't), but our guesses for handling those were correct.  Tiles are double-sided, and you can use either side during gameplay; only deducible from an example picture.  Only 1 person gets the single-square patches as you pass those spots; only obvious because there are only 5 patches.

Looking forward to more plays.

At first I thought Patchwork might get mechanical and samey, but half a dozen plays in and each game seems subtley different due to the random order of the pieces.

The same with how to play: after two plays, and a score in the twenties, I thought "a-ha, I've cracked this", and now I'm happy with anything positive.

It's not a game that's going to excite everyone, but it's a great couples game.

Decent two player game of trying to get buttons for currency and complete your board.  I like how the trailing player goes first and both have the opportunity to finish along the track.  The currency mechanism is decent.

The game is okay, however didn't blow me away.  I wasn't too excited playing this one.  It seemed that many times, usually at the beginning, the choices are limited to low currency and the piece to select is usually obvious.

Perhaps one of the very best "Wife" games. I wonder if Uwe made this with his wife in mind? It sure felt like he made it with my wife in mind! I like it and she loves it. So this is a hit for us. Competitive and cute without "meanness". Great spacial thematic abstract. I normally don't like abstracts but this one is an exception. There is more to this than just playing and fitting Tetris like pieces on your board. You must manage "time" and "money" resources as well as carefully choose which pieces to use even if they are all valid choices.

An unpromising theme but a nonetheless attractive easily played two-person game. There is no luck involved but I have a sneaking suspicion that there is an optimal strategy once you work out how much you need to score per patch square completed, taking account of end-of-game penalties for gaps in your quilt. I've a feeling too that the bonus tile distorts rather than adds to the game.

Easy to play 2p game, really quick and fun, it is great to play with people that don't usually play boardgames.

It is one of Uwe Rosenberg's "test games" that were made while figuring out Feast for Odin, so it has this tetris like style of putting tiles on a board, you have to cover the board with the tiles in order to get points and money is buttons.

I like that it can be pretty unforgiving, since at the end all the squares that are not covered count as -2. In some games the score can be 0 - 4.

It is one of those games you can play multiple times, I like having it on my bag in case I have to wait, I can play with anyone.

Who said Uwe doesn't make light games anymore? Huh? No one said that? Okay....

Anyway, after many heavy hitters Uwe returned to make a light game (Bohnanza light) and it is a solid light game. I think it really belongs to a family setting because the game is really light. 

I got to play this game at my local board game meetup and I am glad that I did get to play it at least once to see what the buzz is about.

Player in this game tries to balance time (like Thebes), income (buttons), and geometric patterns (Tetris) in order to win the game with the most buttons.

The decision is light but interesting enough not to disregard it totally. A solid game but not good enough to own as a gamer's game.

Very much enjoying the game. I love the tetris like spatial element combined with the button-economy, and th compounding benefits of investing in a "button-rich" tile. When playing every round is interesting. Couldn't figure out a decent strategy yet, but I think more we play the more it will clear out.

RATING: 6.75
nice two-player game with a pattern-matching (pseudo-tetris) element. I like that each patch (action) you take costs a different amount of time, which determines how far forward your pawn moves, enabling you to potentially take multiple turns in a row. This adds a little bit more depth of strategy over simply alternating turns as is the case in most games.

I feel that it is a little strategically limited - prioritizing buttons early seems to be a no-brainer, and based on the random order of the patches it may be that one person gets stuck with zero good income-building options. Still, easy to teach and is a unique theme (quilting).

For what it is (a quick playing, essentially abstract, two player game) this is nearly perfect. I have lost count of the number of games I've played of this yet I don't envisage ever growing tired of it. The visual-spatial puzzle is certainly very satisfying but it's the balancing of the two economies of time and money/buttons that is the true heart of this game. It's also both playable with young children yet capable of engaging adults who love deep strategy and tactics. Outstanding.

This is a very cute 2 player game about making a quilt. Players take turn purchasing one of three tetris tiles that are in front of the buying pawn, then move the pawn into the spot that the tile was sitting in, this making different tiles available for the next player. At certain times, the blue button icons pay out buttons, which are one of the currencies used to buy more tiles. When the game ends, players get points for buttons in hand minus heavy penalties for empty spaces. The game buzzes along nicely, and although it's mechanically unremarkable, it's very enjoyable.

Part puzzle. Part resource management. With a hint of screwage (like all good euros) Brilliant game that my wife and I love to the core. We played it 4 times since following the day of purchase! The only other game we did that with was Gubs because it was so easy to play and bring out to dinner. You need a fair amount of table space with this one. This is easily on my top 5 favorite games of all time.

My wife works for a quilting magazine, so I was keen to try Patchwork and see if it would be something she might enjoy. My initial impression is positive -- Uwe finally remembered how to design a simple game! It cleverly disguises the bolts of a multi-factor engine-builder under a charming exterior. My concern is that it is too calculable; my hope is that once both players understand those calculations, it will become more interactive. Now I just need to find a copy. Sarah wrote to Mayfair asking for a review copy for her magazine but they haven't responded!

Update after 10 plays: got my own copy, wife loves it, I love it, all fears allayed and all hopes realised!

This game is simpler than 7 Wonders Duel... and therefore gets played more. Overall, not one of my favorite games. Not complex enough and doesn't take me into another world the way some other games do. Not a knock on it, because that's not what it's trying to do... but just a reflection of my own tastes. (10/23/17)

Starting to like 7 Wonders Duel a lot more. I have no desire to play this game anymore :-( (7/20/17)

losing some interest for me after a couple of plays. Seems like there's not as much decision making as I thought. (1/24/17)

better than 7 wonders duel (which is a good game). More depth and simpler rules.

Another game from my favorite designer. The balance between trying to get patches to increase your buttons to covering you board is great.

Overall one of the best 2 player games I've ever encountered.

The theme put me off for a while, but so many touted this as THE game for couples that I had to give in and try it. Recommended if you like quilts or the Tetris-like polyominoes. The game is a bit harsher than I expected—if you don’t get your button engine going you’re sunk, and at -2 points per each empty space at the end, it’s easy to end up with a negative score. For most couples, I would recommend Santorini, Sagrada, or Splendor over Patchwork.

This is a very simple 2p game, and I really like it when Rosenberg does simple. You're managing a few kinds of currency in this one (money/buttons, time, space on your board) and you're sort of creating and solving your own spatial puzzle in the process. And "controlling tempo" is one of my very favorite things to do in gaming, which you get to do here in spades. 

It's a very smooth, quick-playing game. A real delight, and one that feels like it could have been designed at any point in time.

Nice game: Plays fast, easy to get but some strategic aspects to not let the ideal choice to your opponent as well as to stabilize your incomes. My wife and I like it a lot. Only a few games yet but the urge to play again is present.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Pros:
* Fun spatial puzzles
* Quick turns that keep both players involved/interested
* There are sufficient opportunities for "spite" moves to allow a healthy level of unpredictability. You can push your luck and set yourself up to need a certain tile, but that just gives your opponent more incentive to keep you from getting it. In some situations this can become a dare of sorts. Set yourself up to need a tile with a highly inconvenient shape and then dare your opponent to take it.
* Simple, consistent and minimal rules.
* Love the Thebes-like time track and how it allows for multiple turns in a row.

Cons:
* Takes up a lot of table space.
* The time board is poorly designed. The circular brown track is better, but it was a mistake to put the patches between spaces; it's too easy to treat that like a separate space. In our last play, on one particular turn we miscounted three times and then frustratingly and very carefully moved one space at a time, dramatically counting out the spaces out loud and on our fingers. It shouldn't be that error prone to move around a board.

Neutral:
* 2 player only (this is a pro for us)
* Victory points are also your currency (I quite like games that do this)


= 2015-07-23 - R:6.8

Played four times so far. Once was a "solo" game against a die that just caused tiles to be removed from the game.

We're enjoying this game. Unfortunately, I think I enjoy games with spatial puzzles more than H does. I would probably give the game a 7+ (likely to go up) where she might give it a 6.5 or lower. I split the difference and called it 6.8 for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is not an abstract.

It's a light Euro, economic engine game with a spatial element.

Incredibly attractive components. Very easy on the eyes with its muted colours.

It's a mix of Bunte Runde (object draft), Neuland/Thebes (player turn order), and Universe/Blokus/Kunst Stücke/Domain (playing polyominoes on a board). Actually more like The Princes of Florence as you place polyominoes on your own board, not a shared board.

Very light. Because of the Bunte Runde method of drafting pieces, your choices are typically very limited.

What a wonderful 2-player experience! The concept is simple, the rules short, but the gameplay involving. It has a rather solitary feel, but there's some interaction too - my move determines what my opponent can get, so being aware of his progress can be critical at times. Don't let him get the best tiles for his patchwork! Fast, not too thinky, but not mindless either, a great game for any couple that likes lighter games (or enjoys fillers from time to time). Plus, it's really beautiful. Thumbs up Uwe for making something one would not expect from you.

[B]RO:[/B] [I]03/11/2016[/I]

This is a great two-player abstract game. Reminds me strongly of Tetris, but with the theme of making a (very ugly) patchwork quilt. Basically, you are selecting from a wheel of oddly shaped quilt swatches, with only a few being available to you on any turn, you are using these to fill up as much space on your player board as possible. They have two costs, one is time (which will move a marker along a track, when both players are the end the game is over), the other is 'buttons' which acts as the game's currency. At certain points on the time track you will gain buttons for any button symbols on your own quilt pieces, as well as small 1x1 'patches' if you're the first to pass a particular point on the track. You may also acquire buttons by passing and moving the number of spaces required to put your marker in front of your opponent, and collecting that many buttons. If you are behind your opponent on the track it is your turn, in this way you may take multiple turns before your opponent can do anything.

It is very interesting and requires a surprisingly amount of forethought considering the simple mechanics. Further, it is an interesting offering from Uwe Rosenberg whom doesn't usually design this sort of thing (but I do find that while playing it [i]does[/i] feel like one of his designs. Overall, if you're going to be doing a large amount of two-player gaming there is no reason not to pick this one up.

Good 2-player game. May be AP prone. Trying to figure out the best way to patch your piece of matierials is fun but then you try to also mess up your opponent. Adding this to though process may drug things up. Each turn you pick one from up to three options, each option however generates different three options which come after that and so on. 

There is a running joke in my gaming group that in a Patchwork World Championship finals best two players would start a game with few passes and then one of them would stood up and congratulated the other.

Great tile-laying abstract game with simple rules and very tough decisions every round. The game offers strategic options and has great tactical depth, as with every choice of a tile players must balance several factors such as price, time, income earned, area covered, blocking the availability of a tile, as well as measuring when to stay behind and when to jump ahead of the opponent on the time track.

Great two player game.  Simple, yet engaging.  Nice puzzle aspect regarding how to lay the tiles.  Some good tactics involved in which tiles to buy, and when to not buy a tile, but move your token forward instead.

Personally, I raided my wife sewing supplies and put all "real" buttons in the box, rather than the cardboard buttons.

Uwe Rosenberg is the man, let's just get that out there. The guy can make great games. I wasn't sure how good Patchwork was actually going to be. Would it be too heavy? Too complicated? Not fun? 

Nope. It's perfect. It's just a blast to play and feels fresh enough to play a lot of. Not quite the level of depth as All Creatures Big and Small, but enough where you can play this a couple of times over a glass of wine with your SO.

Very good two player (almost) filler game, with some indirect interaction. It is a spatial puzzle at first glance, but it really has an economic aspect and tradeoff between economy (buttons) and victory points (covered spaces).

Interaction comes with the turn order mechanism, racing for  the bonus patches and which tiles you let be available for your opponent in the next turn; rather subtle, but this is no twoplayer-solitaire.

This is such a great little game.  I see why people think Uwe is a great designer.  The game seems very balanced although it can be a bit discouraging to get negative scores for your first few plays.  Tetris + time management + blocking your opponent = Patchwork

Jogo estranho, mas funcional, que confere bastante tensão aos jogadores, uma vez que muitas vezes a peça que encaixa bem acaba por demorar demasiado tempo a preparar e a decisão fica complicada. O tema é forçado e essa é capaz de ser a pior parte, aliada a componentes que podiam e deviam ser bem melhores, especialmente para um jogo de um autor tão consagrado como Rosemberg. É um "Ubongo" sofisticado...

A fast playing light puzzle game that has a little brain burn to it.  The theme doesn't really integrate so it could just be a pure abstract that crosses tetris with an economic engine (buttons) but I'm okay with it because it is interactive but not too mean.  A strategic game were thinking a couple moves ahead can really pay off.  But not so frustrating if things don't work as planned as there are other options until the last couple turns.  Therse aretTraits that are rare in shorter two player only games type games. Overall, a really enjoyable game that lasts about 25-35 minutes but feels much more than a filler.  It is rare to find a shorter game these days that has some meat to it.

RATING: 6.5
It's a nice game FOR TWO PLAYERS ONLY, fast to learn, quick to play but with some more depth that it seems at a first sight. The mechanics fits perfect with the theme of the game.

I only played once, but initially I give it a 6,5. I'll go back to this after a few more plays.

>>> Edit:  After a few plays I give it a 6,5. Really original and squared, but the difference while scoring between nail it or do it right is really really huge. There are no gray tones, you succeed or you lose as a bastard.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Select one of three available pieces to add to your patchwork. Pay a cost in time and 'buttons' (the games money). If you have used more time than your opponent then they now take a turn. It combines a few relatively recent game mechanics (the time track turn ordering) and some popular euro elements (trade offs in future generation of money) into a two player pure abstract. The result is interesting and visually pleasing but I do not think adds any significant depth beyond Knizia's Tutankhamun or Hey That's my Fish! while sacrificing in terms of game length and flexibility on number of players.

I got this game as a birthday present in December 2015 (the Czech edition, which my wife found cheap - it was sold out for sensible prices here in the UK, luckily the English rules are available online and very straightforward). We played our first game that night, and both enjoyed it (I got thrashed 38-17, which is fairly normal when I play my wife, particularly with a new game). Plenty of non-obvious decisions, while also playing quickly. Neither of us was wowed by it though, I don't really see why this has got so high on the BGG rankings, and neither of us can see this being a game we play all the time. But it's certainly a good game, one that I'm glad I now own, and our opinion may well go up as a result of future plays - which will definitely happen.

Update May 2016: we actually only played our second and third games today, and my opinion basically hasn't changed. A good and interesting game, one I'd usually be happy to play - but nothing special.

RATING: 6
This is a solid little game. The idea of both players making a patchwork quilt with the randomly shaped pieces of cloth that become available is a new mechanic for me. 

It's a pretty simple game to explain and play, but there can be a bit of luck involved in what pieces become available. It's also very important to realise how important buttons are on pieces, especially early. Will also test your Tetris skills a bit!

The game is compact and the pieces are good quality. Though we did go to a craft store and replace all the card buttons (the currency in the game) with actual blue buttons, in 2 sizes. We both feel this really adds to the game.

Overall, a pretty solid game. A bit of a favorite of Layana's. While I don't love it, it's certainly good and quick enough for me to agree to play just about anytime.

well at least I don't have to worry about designing a patchwork quilt game. I thought about it last year, wrote a few things down, but had others to worry about. I'm glad to see the idea was good enough for Mr Rosenberg to recognize it as a good design as well. His is definitely a bit deeper than I was going for. I'll have to try this game out when I get a chance. My mother in law might actually play a game with my wife and I if this was brought to the table. :P

I have played this game more times than I can count! It's so great having a solid 2-player game. Patchwork is just so clean and smooth. Great to introduce a friend to board gaming; this is one of the best for that intent. Hardcore gamers will be left disappointed though, as your choices are very limited in this game, and after enough plays, there is a clear best course of action on each turn. Nonetheless, I'll still play this game with anyone!

solid, solid two player game. some people don't care for the "randomness" in the beginning game layout which could offer one play juicier tiles, but if you've played the game then you know there are ways to delay. in fact, that's the best part of the game: the time track which can allow you to make huge plays, but only if you're willing to give your opponent huge slack to make similar plays or repeat a few smaller plays for tactical advantage. it's a race to accrue the most buttons, but it's also a race to cover the most spaces. you can be efficient with your purchases or efficient with your time, but probably not both. plus, like i said, you have to be aware of what you're allowing your opponent to buy next round. i wouldn't say there's "screwage" or "take-that" so much as there is just some blocking involved. everybody likes tetris. personally, i LOVED the old two-player head-to-head Puzzle Fighter arcade game! well, this is not either of those, but it scratches a similar itch in a bite-sized chunk. quick but not-un-thinky, portable, somewhat windproof, and family themed. this game is a winner.

It's a good abstract 2-player game, and since I dislike 2-player abstracts, that's saying a lot. My wife enjoys it, and we're pretty evenly skilled at it, so that's a big plus. But I don't really understand why it is so popular. The time mechanism similar to Glen More is interesting, but I don't really enjoy how it interacts with racing to claim the one-square leather pieces (we hated the score track bonus tiles in Carc the Castle and played without them). A lot of time can be spent (wasted?) calculating what sequence of moves you should take to guarantee you get the leather and prevent your opponent from getting it. They are basically each worth a 4 point swing, but we may just remove them like we did with Carc.

Patchwork has already received a lot of play since I received it.  It has to be my favorite 2 player game so far. in Patchwork players try to fill their player boards with all different shapes of quilt pieces to prevent from losing points. The catch is you have to buy these pieces using buttons and spending time to add the piece to your quilt, and buttons are points. 

Pros: unique 2player interaction.simple rules, deep strategic decision making. Fun tile placement aspect. Nice components. 

Cons: not an extremely engrossing theme. Abstract turn order can cause one player to have multiple turns in a row.

:thumbsup: The polyomino-puzzle is really fun to put together in and of itself. And here it’s combined with resource management: buttons (your points [u]and[/u] the currency with which you buy polyominoes) and time (how often you and your opponent will be able to buy polyominoes).
:thumbsup: The game ‘grows’ with the players. At first you’re just trying to complete your own quilt as efficiently as possible. A few games later, you’ll start eyeing your opponent’s quilt and thinking about how you can further your own efforts while hindering theirs.
:thumbsup: Gorgeous game!

:thumbsdown: A shame that it’s only 2-player. It’s a really good 2-player game, but I think it would be a good 3- or 4-player game as well. One could argue that [thing=204027][/thing] or [thing=233678][/thing] are “multiplayer Patchwork”, but that’s really not the case.

They don't make many games like this anymore. Patchwork is a sharp two-player game in the tradition of the Kosmos line. It's also classic Rosenberg, before he fell down the pit of worker-placement monsters. The tension between timing and taking the really big useful patch now or later is really fun. The cute production helps a lot too. This is one of those rare games my wife played and immediately wanted to by, and I absolutely agree on its merits.

The score may raise with future plays. I really enjoyed how quickly this game plays. I love the components and felt the decisions were deeper than I originally thought. It's not the main event of a game night, but a great choice when you have an hour to kill and have only two. Very cool game.

Edit: Upping score from 7.5 to 8.5. This is just so great.

RATING: 7
Patchwork's tranquil theme belies its cutthroat mechanics. When played among beginning players of equal skill, Patchwork can seem like a non-combative affair, but competitive players can easily drive new players' scores into the dirt. It's an excellent brain-burner, but playing to win (as opposed to just improving your own score) can make this title incredibly stressful.

I like this game with my 9 year old son.  It plays relatively quickly and we are, so far, somewhat evenly matched.  He has a good spatial sense so he can work out the strategy and see a move or two in advance.

This is a brilliant little game. Everybody around here just loves it. The kids bring it out and play against each other when they have 20 minutes to spare, then my 11 yo daughter dreams of putting a patchwork quilt of her own. A little imagination and a pleasant theme are all that's needed to bring smiles to their faces. The game itself is very simple to pick up, but with a lot of quick forward planning to be done that keeps it very entertaining. Plan what you need.. Deny your opponent. There's the button economy to build up, but then the seperate building of the quilt with all the spacial challenges that evolves. Just wonderful.

Got it first for iOS and was instantly charmed by it. I figured my wife would adore it, and I was not mistaken as it's now the game she requests to play regularly. Seems so simple, but has a crazy amount of depth once you dig into it. Using time as a mechanic makes what would be a really simple game into a complex brain-burning good time.

The game reverses the mechanics of [b]Blokus[/b] - instead of players drawing from their individual pieces and placing them on a communal board, players draw from a communal set of pieces and place them on their individual board. Add in a time track similar to [b]Thebes[/b] with set scoring points and an interesting resource management element, and you get quite an involving game.

In this game, each player has their own design for a quilt on a board in front of them.  Then, each round, the player has to choose from one of three Tetris style pieces to try and fill as much as the pattern as they can, while balancing time spent and getting more buttons!  2 player only, excellent design! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Patchwork is definitely more than a cute little abstract. It has solid choices, variability, indirect interaction, and light engine building, all with some fun spatial puzzling to solve. The game has a good length, which helps make up for it being potentially too simple.

However, I think it needs something more. And expansion would help, to maybe add some individual player powers or hidden objectives or some other extra rules. Regardless, as is, it's a great game.

One of our favorite 2 player tetris piece games. This game takes a suprising amount of table space to spread all the pieces into a circle. We love playing this game and as long as you get a button engine going it is enjoyable. I really don't like the few games where you don't have an opportunity to buy pieces with buttons and you end up money starved and spend your turns jumping past your opponent for a few buttons while they rake it in. Love this game, go get it.

At the end of the day it's just another engine builder with matching amount of interaction (gentle queue cutting) and drowned in pedestrian brown pastels. 

[i]Even with a potentially colourful theme, nope, you can't get clean bright colours, we'll drown them in brown so middle aged couples feel comfy around the game and somewhat sedated. Yes, I imagine sewing diagrams for kids and sewing magazines of old and they had white background (!) and clear colours. But somebody had to slap mimetic realism even on (basically) Tetris and this is why we can't have beautiful things. [/i]

Combining engine building with spatial puzzle is kinda original and semi-clever (for time being). But. Even with my SO liking the theme and winning the game and being kinda excited we just ended up trying to find a compromise between cost-efficiency and spatial puzzle and pretty much ignoring the other player. Yes I'm sure if you play the game 90+ times other player will matter (sigh). Almost as much as the random set up... Sooo... it's engine building plus spatial elements minus any sort of narrative progression (like building a church or whathaveyou). Weirdly enough I found soloing Princes of Florence to be more charming (the original version, not the dark brown refry). As for Uwe - Mamma Mia! is our 2 player game of choice. 

[Non-brown version in the Heiko's style, I'd rate a 4.0. Well, it is a bit higher]

Played once. A rather interesting departure from Uwe Rosenberg's repertoire of light card games and heavier resource conversion games, Patchwork has players competing to fill up a personal board with patches of fabric. The options here are limited to choosing one out of three tiles each turn, but there are plenty of elements which have to be considered when making that choice. Players essentially have to juggle between earning buttons, pacing oneself on the time track and attempting to cover the board as much as possible. 

Personally, I felt a little antsy leaving holes on the board when placing pieces, but that's what a childhood spent playing Tetris does to you. The breezy theme and nature of the gameplay is also somewhat marred by the fact that it is very possible to get a negative score – who knew quilting was such a stressful affair? Quibbles aside, Patchwork is a tactical, quick and overall pleasant experience.

Patchwork is probably our favorite two player only game. The Tetris puzzle is incredibly brain-burny, and so is the decision making process on which types of pieces to take in the early game. The button economy is super rewarding, and so is the balance the game strikes with the better pieces forcing you ahead on the time track to give your opponent a chance to maybe make multiple smaller purchases. The added fact that a game only takes 15-20 minutes and has almost no set up or tear down time means Patchwork will always be a game that regularly hits our table.

The theme and mechanics fit very will. Regarding two-player - in a lot of games I dislike two players because it makes the game too combative. In patchwork it is just another strategic element, one that fits the weight of the game because you're mostly only looking ahead to your opponents turn and possibly your own next turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Somewhat mathy perfect information abstract. It is easy to calculate the point-value of each piece at any given time, but that is only the first step. Then you have to make sure you don't run of buttons and end up having to waste turns, which means you need to look ahead to know how many buttons you can spare, etc. And you have to calculate the value of every patch, which is not difficult but still takes a bit of time, especially if you aren't good at arithmetic. 

It took me a while to convince Michelle that there is an interesting game in there, but she still isn't particularly fond of it on account of the amount of tedious math involved in every little calculation. Some people treat this as a light, not-too-thinky game, but we won't play it if we aren't prepared to put a lot of thought into it.

One of my favorite games! The theme seems weird to most people, which I think can be a turn-off. I'll usually describe it as "competitive two-player Tetris" which helps.

Super quick to learn, pretty fast to play, and a LOT of hidden depth. You'll be terrible your first round, but get better really fast. Can't recommend this game enough. It's definitely my favorite two-player game and one I'll always play.

When you're a few turns away from the end, especially if the other player has already finished, I really like calculating what's the overall point differential I can achieve with every possible move.

Uwe bácsi végre elszakadt a zöldségektől és sikerült is nagyot alkotni a Patchworkkel. A kétszemélyes játékban a Firenze hercegeihez hasonlóan a saját 9x9-es táblánkban tetrisezünk különböző ruhadarabokkal. Célunk a teljes tábla minél jobb lefedése. A körünkben a körbe a játék elején véletlenszerűen lerakott ruhadarabok közül mindig az aktuális 3 közül választhatunk, ahol éppen a jelölő jár, utána másik játékos jön. Egy-egy ruhadarab gombba, illetve időbe kerül, amit egy külön táblán jelölünk. Ezen mindig a kevesebb időt felhasználó játékos jön. Ez is ismerős lehet már más játékokból. Tehát igazából sok újdonság nincs, mégis sikerült egy nagyon jó gyurás Uwe mesternek a már meglévő mechanizmusokból. Készített egy szerencsefüggetlen, sokszor újrajátszható játékot két személy részére. Megelőlegezem neki a nagy pontot, ami maximum eggyel csökkenhet, ha a két játék alapján levont erős stratégiám többször bejönne.

Easy to learn and hard to master.  Every game is different as the patch pieces are randomized around the game board.  Strategies of going first or second, do you buy this piece just to have your opponent buy a piece that causes them to move ahead of you with time so you can score the piece you really want 5 pieces away.  So much strategy is learned after you play through the game 5 or 6 times.

A two-player abstract game from the worker-placement-resource-conversion-breeding-animals-farming-enthusiastic designer Uwe, which is very easy to learn but provides tons of variability and tough decisions to make in the game. A simple Tetris idea is expanded with two elements, "COST" and "TIME", into a very sophisticated battle. The theme is nicely pasted on and using buttons as the currency is very amusing. Quick, simple, challenging. Highly recommended!

Patchwork is on the more interesting end of the Kosmos 2p series, along with the travel edition of Ingenious. Granted, it's not actually a Kosmos 2p game, but it might as well be. The box fits. Inside the box there's an engine-building economic game, and a good one--but it's not just a snowball-building exercise. Here the goal is to collect victory points but the primary currency is time, and there's no way to buy more of it. The value of any particular choice is always a bit fuzzy. This is not to say that the game is massively deep; it isn't. But it is way deeper than you would expect for a quick-playing 2p game.

This is _very_ good, even though I'm terrible at puzzles! I ended up with a negative score, which is probably how I'll score most often. Still, it's quick and fun!

The rules are very simple: players each start with a 9x9 grid board, and 5 buttons. The time track has spaces for 1-box pieces; place them there. Lay the puzzle pieces in a circle around the board, randomly. Place the token in front of the smallest piece.

The player behind on the time track takes turn(s) until they're in front. On your turn, either:
- take the piece 1-3 spaces ahead of it and put the token in it's place. Pay the price (in buttons) as indicated on the piece, then place it on your board. Advance on the time track by the number of spaces indicated on the piece.
OR
- move your time marker just ahead of the other player, taking 1 button from the bank for each space you advance.

Whenever you advance your time marker past certain spaces on the track, take the size-1 piece and place onto your board.
The first player to completely fill in a 7x7 area of their grid gets the bonus VP. 

The game ends when both players reach the end of the score track. Score 1 point per button, and lose 2 per empty space on your board. Most (positive!) points wins!

I was really looking forward to this game simply because Uwe Rosenberg is one of, if not my favorite designer.

This is a really simple two-player only game of competitive Tetris.  In this game players will take turns purchasing one of 3 available tiles, all the tiles are laid out at the beginning of the game in a large circle and you can purchase one of the 3 tiles ahead of a pawn placed in this circle.  The tiles all have two costs on them, one in buttons, which is both a form of currency and your victory points at game end, and the other in time.  The tiles are different shapes and sizes and players are trying to fill in as much of their 9x9 grid with these tiles as possible.  Players also progress along a time track and whoever is at the back of the track gets to take a turn, much like in Glen More.  When both players reach the end of the time track the final scores are a player's buttons minus 2x the number of their empty spaces.

There are two ways to get buttons in this game.  One is to forgo purchasing a tile and move your piece to exactly one space ahead of your opponent on the time track getting 1 button for each space moved.  This is incredibly inefficient.  The other way is by passing "income" spaces that give you one button for every button on tiles you've placed.  Some of the tiles have buttons on them.

That's my main gripe with the game, the tiles with buttons on them are so much more  valuable than any of the other tiles.  If you can get a tile with buttons on it, you need to.  This, first of all, needs to be told to new players (it wasn't to me and I lost 40-0) but even then it is the only real strategy.  And sometimes just dumb luck can screw you here.  If none of the next 3 tiles has buttons on it you are stuck either possibly making one available for purchase by your opponent or losing ground by not taking a meaningful turn.  Those tiles just dictate too much of the game.

However, the rest of the game is an enjoyable puzzle and it plays really quickly.  Not bad for an occasional play but still one of my least favorite Rosenberg games.

A fun spin on the abstract combinatorial game using mechanics more typical to eurogames. I find it interesting that the limited decision space created by the tiles creates a sort of upper limit to the amount of turns you can think ahead, making it more accessible to non-gamers.

I adore Patchwork.  A brilliant little Uwe Rosenberg two player game with a theme that's reminiscent of the game Little Big Planet (maybe a little Animal Crossing too?).  But if you aren't into the cutesy sounding theme (because you are an old curmudgeon, I assume?), don't let that turn you off.  There's a lot of strategy in Patchwork as you balance between covering the area of your board in fabric (and patching up any holes), and getting buttons for points.  The Ios for this game is solid too and comes with other thematic options for your patchwork masterpieces.  The only issue I have is that sometimes nearer the end of the game you may feel strapped for options - so thinking about the endgoal you have for your design is a must.

A clever game with more strategy than it initially appears to hold.  Players have to anticipate what the other person may do, but also be prepared in case they surprise you.  While there is no take-that element, it can be cutthroat when it comes to getting the right piece that will fit your tableau.  Long before the end of the game, I realized that I had not been planning well by taking pieces early that would fit together but had low button income, because I was scrambling at the end.

[Mayfair Games 14 edition] {Cloth; tile-laying; 2p} Patchwork is an attractive abstract game.  It has simple rules, good player interaction and high replayability.  It offers short-term decision and long-term planning.

Players are solving puzzling to fill up their board - yet to complete for the necessary patches from the board.  Another challenge is to balance the income and expense.

The only problem of this game is that it needs a big table :)

Some of the patches cannot fit well to each other... Not good.

I like the square score board, but my wife and daughters like the circle one ...
Highly recommended.

Fun little game. Surprising depth reveals itself after a few plays, yet rules are very simple. Theme doesn't catch me though.

If knitting or embroidery or any other forms of weaving/cloth manipulation is your thing and you'd like to play a game on it this is it for you. If you like a small accessible game which give you a "puzzle" feel, this is recommendable. Otherwise, ok but there are better 2p games in the (somewhat) abstract genre (Onitama, any in the Gipf series).

12/25/15: Not AS groundbreaking as I had been expecting. Patchwork is an abstract two-player game that -- so far -- seems to get reactions similar to "huh, neat" at the end. If I'm only playing with one other player I'd so hard rather be playing Jaipur, a game that seems just as simple and yet contains far more depth, fun, and camels. Patchwork doesn't have camels, Jaipur does.

There are two ways to introduce this game in my mind, one very right and one very wrong.

1. Want to play a board game about quilting?
2. Want to play competitive tetris, board game style?

Seriously, the theme, while cute, will not appeal to most male gamers. That SHOULD NOT STOP THEM FROM PLAYING THIS GAME, as it is a marvelous display of game design!  If you can get over a beige castles of burgundy board, you can get over quilting.  

This game is a 2 player only experience.  You take tiles and try to place them on your grid (a la tetris) without leaving any open areas.  The turn and purchasing mechanic are what make this game so appealing.  Buying a piece requires both money and turn priority.  You are constantly balancing in your plans whether you want to give up your cash or allow your opponent more turns to play.  The end result is a fantastic mix of planning ahead, keeping your opponent from buying pieces, and money management.  If you are looking for a 2 player game, this is top dog in my collection.

Only played it once so far. At first both I and my daughter (18 yrs) thought "what kind of kids game is this?". Soon we started to realize the depth and strategic opportunities there is and the opinion changed for the positive. Still feels a little mechanical but it sure will be played a lot more.

My rating might be downgraded in the future, but as of right now, my wife and I love playing this 2-player game.  It has the right amount of strategy between the two of us and puzzliness with your own board.

Update (July 2016)...this is another game that is awesome, but the iOS app is getting played WAY more than the cardboard version.  My wife will get 4-6 games in an evening before bed, playing on her iPad.  But the game is still great!

I have a lot of plays in on this on iOS, and not so much on the tabletop. Good little two player game. Not sure how deep it is - there seems to be a fairly straight forward approach to the game, so then it starts being luck of turn order and/or order that the patches are in.

This is a very easy game to teach someone. It only took me less than 5 minutes to explain all of the components of the game and start playing. Aside from the simplicity, it really takes a bit more planning for someone to win the game. 

To give you an idea on the complexity of the game, you will need to do the following: 
- watch and predict what patch your opponent needs
- plan on the patch you need and what is available
- manage and balance the buttons you have to buy the patch and at the same time to keep as much as you can to win the game
- lastly to fill up your board as much as possible to avoid the penalty at the end of the game

All and all, I truly enjoy this game very much. You can definitely play this game with non-gamer and he/she will still be able to enjoy it.

This one grew on me. At first, I thought, "Cute!" Then I thought, "Well, this will get old." And then I thought, "Wow, this one has staying power." And now I think, "Damn it, why can't I stop playing this?!" It's repetitive in the best way because it asks you to be that much more efficient in your placements, and that much more careful in your purchases.

An Uwe Rosenberg game that's not about farming?  I'm intrigued.  It's a fairly light, 2 player game about making a quilt that relies on a combination of Tetris-style tile placement, engine building, and Red November-style time management.  It makes for a nice little filler, but nothing groundbreaking.

RATING: 8
This is a fun, quick game.  I wouldn't consider it abstract strategy though.  I'd call it a family/strategy game.  It's a light strategy game for two players with great replayability because of the randomness of patch setup.  The randomness also creates quite a luck factor though.  Sometimes the right patches just seem to line up for you and other times they don't.  It seems imperative to get good button income going as early as possible, if you want to do well, but in some games that just isn't possible because of the early layout of buttons available.

One game I will score 30 points and the very next game I will score -5 (negative scores are not uncommon because you lose 2 points for each unoccupied space on your quilt board at the end).  Now between those two games I didn't have a brain aneurism, so what happened?  The patches favored me far more in the first game.  At least that's my excuse. ;)

Still a fun game though with plenty of opportunities to be clever with your moves.  Interaction between the two players doesn't seem apparent at first since you are both working on your own individual quilts, but you soon realize that what your opponent does can affect you greatly and vice versa.  So you are constantly trying to get the upper hand on each other on the time track and the common patch pool.

Overall, a good and enjoyable little strategy game.  Very unique, that's for sure!

Patchwork takes about 5 minutes to setup and about 20 minutes to play. This is a game that you will want to play again and again and one that will stay in your collection permanently if you are anything like me. Uwe Rosenberg has typically designed much heavier more in depth games in the past. To see Mr. Rosenberg design such a lighthearted, quick playing game for 2 players is a refreshing break from some of what he is best known for. I love his heavier designs as well but this is an approachable game that could very well be used as a gateway game for those looking to get into the hobby for the first time, and that is a beautiful thing. This game is about 22 to 25 dollars online and at your friendly local game store and is worth every penny. I rated this game an 8.5 and almost rated it higher than that. The game is that good, and for two players only I’m not sure that there are many out that are better. The reason that this game is so approachable is that it will include a large audience appeal whereas other popular two player titles like Magic The Gathering and Dice Masters will not necessarily appeal to everyone in the family like Patchwork will. This game is one that I would feel comfortable playing with my Grandma and Grandpa. It might be a bit tougher to get some of my family excited about piloting a Goblin Aggro deck from Magic The Gathering to victory. There is beauty in the simplicity of this game but there is also such strategic depth that it will draw in new gamers and seasoned tabletop players alike.

RATING: 8
A new 2-player favorite.

Major props to the publishers for going with a theme that was fairly risky. Yes, Quilt Show broke that ground and showed that a game with a quilting theme could be well received, but still. You've got to think there were many others that were safer.

The mechanic for acquiring the patches is innovative and keeps the tactical decisions simple by limiting what you can buy now, but does allow for strategic planning by showing you everything available in the near AND long term. It makes for a nice blend of planning and makes for a perfect information game that does not promote AP. This is the genius of the game.

I think it also uses the turn order mechanic from Neuland and Glen More to good effect. It allows for more control and gives opportunities for clever play. Most importantly, without it, the patch buying thing doesn't work. The calculation would be so dry and predictable that the game would both take longer and be much less interesting.

This is the first time I've ever said this about a Mayfair game, but they got everything right.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 2

This game works a bit like two player tetris game. Each player trying to fill his board of squares with different shapes and sizes of squares. Collecting buttons along the way.

While the game does have some luck involved, it definitely rewards tactical skill.

I must say that this game is really well designed, there are a lot of things going on. The selection of different tetris style tiles that you have to pick for your board, you have to consider the time each patch tile costs. And also the way you generate points collecting buttons. Despite all these cool mechanics I don't think the game is fun. I have played it many times but each time you just pick tiles, place them and after a while the game is over. And often you can already see who the winner is long before the game is over. There is no surprises, no take-that moments. its just not a fun time playing this.

Great little 2 player game, with a lot of replayability. The set up means that every game is different, and strategies do start to emerge the more you play. Beginners will focus on their own boards, making the game a bit of a solitaire initially, but soon enough, you'll be watching that other board and considering not just the shapes but also the scoring value of your pieces. If you have an opponent that you can play over and over with, you scores will slowly get closer and closer until every game becomes a fairly tight strategic affair.

Great for introducing casual players to more advanced game play concepts.

The Good: Easy setup, fast gameplay, engaging spacial-puzzle mechanism, simple but tough choices, well balanced and rewarding in the end.

The Bad: It takes a lot more space than I imagined. Way too much for a light 2p game. You literally have to empty the box contents to the table and spread it around. It really is themeless.

RATING: 7
Patchwork is a two player game where you are trying to fill your board (a 9 x 9 grid) with "fabric" pieces as completely as possible. At the end of the game empty spots count against your score 2 pts each. Pieces come in a variety of shapes, each with a cost in buttons and time.

On your turn you buy one of the three pieces at the front of the line. You pay the buttons and advance on the time track as many spaces as it cost in time. The piece designating the beginning of the line moves to the space where the piece you took was (so if you skip some pieces, they move to the end of the line).

If you choose not to buy a piece, or can't due to lack of money or space restrictions, then you advance on the time track to a spot one space ahead of your opponent. You collect a button for every space you advanced. Whoever is further back on the time track takes the next turn. If you ever move onto your opponent's piece, you are considered "further back" on the time track.

Additionally, if you ever cross a button icon on the time track, then all the buttons on pieces you've put onto your board pays you a button. There's also some "patches", single square pieces, that are awarded to the first player to pass them.

When you reach the end of the time track, you're done. You wait for your opponent to be done and then you score. Every empty space on your board docks you two points, every button you own gives you a point (the last spot on the board triggers a last button income). There's also a 7 point bonus for the first person to complete a fully filled in 7 x 7 section.

I didn't really know what to expect from this game. It's a clever game where timing is very important. Knowing when to spend a lot of time is crucial. You want your opponent to spend a lot of time, so that you can buy a lot of pieces while he gets no turns. But some pieces give you a lot of button income, or fill a lot of space, or fit the weirdly shaped gap you've left yourself, and so you may be willing to spend extra time to snag them. And of course, you want to time things so that you can pick up the special single-space patches.

Although I've only played it against the AI, I've enjoyed the game a fair bit. It's more fun than many other abstracts. The quilt theme goes a long way towards making the game feel less abstract. I don't know if this is a game I'd enjoy as much over the board, but it makes for a great time-waster app.

About [thing=163412][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=163412][/thing] is a two players game in which the goal is to make the best quilt. Sure, it doesn't sound all that exciting, but sometimes you just need a relaxing time with a partner, right? Some soothing moments, taking some tiles and arranging them, tetris-style, in a personal board with a 9x9 grid.

[thing=163412][/thing] demands little and give a lot. The rules are very easy to teach and the gameplay as smooth as it can be. Most of the time you will be taking tiles and putting them on your board, in a way that few open spaces remain - there is no point to a quilt with holes all over it.

The interaction is mostly indirect - taking something the other might want -, with some dispute over the leather tiles. Hurt feelings won't happen all that often. I guess is possible to play more aggressively, wanting to push the other to unplaceable tiles, however this seems to me like a proper way to put yourself in a dead end.

[thing=163412][/thing] is a quick game, very well knitted together, with important decisions to be made throughout.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player starts with 5 buttons. Every turn the player must do one of two actions:
a) Take a tile, pay the number of buttons required and advance, on the time track, the number of indicated spaces;
b) Advance on the time track until your token is one space in front of the other player - gain 1 button per space advanced.

When you take a tile you must immediately put it on your board, and the tile can't be moved once is put there.

Some tiles have buttons on them. When you reach certain spots on the time track, you will get an income of buttons equal to the number of buttons your tiles have. Also, some places on the track have tiles of special patch - 1x1 in size. The first person to reach these spaces get the tile and put them on her board - this is very good to fill some holes on the quilt.

The time track serves not only to mark income and to take leather squares. It also serves to mark whose turn it is. The person behind on the time track is the person in turn. And this person plays until she passes the other player, which can mean multiple plays in a row.

Finally, once both players reach the end of the time track, the game ends. Buttons are worth 1 point each. For every space not covered, the player loses 2 points. There is also a goal token - the first player (if any) to fill a 7x7 grid, gains the goal token, which is worth 7 points at the end of the game. The person with the most points, after deducting for the uncovered spaces, will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Mostly will be what tile to buy. This is a three fold decision:
a) The cost of it, the time it will advance you and if it has or not buttons for income - this affects, of course, the amount of money you will have for your next purchase and the position on the time track, which may allow for another go for yourself, to trigger income, or give you one of the coveated special patch tiles;
b) The shape of it - not only to fit in your board, but also how big it is, as you also need to cover as much space as possible;
c) Which position the marker will end, as tiles restricts the next buying phase - for you, if you are going to play again (still behind in time) or, more likely, to your opponent.

Even though it has ramifications, the decision isn't hard, specially because you will only have three options of tiles to take, and one or two you might not even be able to fit or to pay for.

The other decision is when to "jump" in time, in order to gain buttons to pay for things. This is a thing to avoid - jumping is objectively a bad move most of the time, as you lose precious time not filling your board, and since for every square open you will lose 2 points, and a button is worth 1 point, is almost like you lose 1 point for every space jumped. Still, this will be need, but usually won't be a decision on itself - you will simply do it because you can't pay for any of the next three tiles.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- It is beautiful, with a good graphic design and comes in a small box, very good to store and to take around;
- Language independant;
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Short playing time;
- The random order of the tiles makes for a simple way to increase replay value;
- Some interaction, but not enough to leave people mad (usually very important in a 2 player game), in a low pressure environment;
- It is super nice to fill the board with the tiles.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Only for 2 players;
- No solo rules;
- Too friendly for those looking for high confrontational and bloody 2 player game.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
There is something very satisfying in seeing that blank board slowly filling up with shapes and colors, with some cute blue buttons showing. It reminds me of the the hint of life and colors just around the corner in that winter days, and the promise of heat and peace, in a warm room with a good book. It offers a sense of advancement, like an unfolding story, in a comfy and inviting enviroment.

I don't usually like 2 players game - not that I don't enjoy confrontation, but I get tense and stressed when is a head-to-head thing, as it feels that, even when 2 players are battling, but there are more people involved, some steam is let loose or redirected. Therefore, I usually lean towards friendlier 2 players game, either cooperative ones, like [thing=71836][/thing], or with most indirect interaction, like [thing=28143][/thing] or [thing=50][/thing], with just some highly thematic games passing this bar, such as [thing=36932][/thing], [thing=45986][/thing] and [thing=115746][/thing], or extra quick, like [thing=147020][/thing]. [thing=163412][/thing] is more in line with [thing=50][/thing] than with [thing=147020][/thing], with the kicker of building your own board, which is something I adore doing in games.

[thing=163412][/thing] is always pushing its way to the end - every turn it gets closer and closer, never stopping, but there is truly no stress in here: you have your time to pick, and there is only truly 4 possibilities each turn - either to take one of the three tiles after the marker, or jump on the track to gain some buttons.

In the end, [thing=163412][/thing] hits several buttons (he) without dropping the stitch a single time. It is quick, efficient and ever going forward, without adding too much pressure. Very recommended.

This is just an elegant little game, one of our very favorite 2p games when we don't want to invest a few hours or a couple evenings to play something more complicated.

The component parts are nothing that new - the shape fitting is similar to Ubongo or Space Cadets torpedos, the time tracking is like Thebes, and the circle of moving options is like Seeland, but they come together quite nicely here. Always tense, in my games against Kayleigh so far.

A brilliant 2-player design, I'm very impressed.  Simple enough for anyone to understand instantly, yet plenty of serious strategy to keep you interested.  The only randomness in the game is the order that the patches become available.  The spatial puzzle that is fitting all the patches together is where the game really shines.

I don't get this one.  I love Uve Rosenberg, I play 2-player games primarily, I'm not turned off by the theme, and everyone else except my wife and I seem to enjoy this game.

This is not to say it's a terrible game, but it's really quite basic and while the calculations involved in using space vs. collecting buttons is somewhat interesting, I think I expected more out of the Tetris-like puzzle.  

You do have to solve it like a Tetris puzzle if you are planning to be the first to collect the 7x7 bonus tile points, but if you are going another strategy, or after that tile has been acquired, any Tetris puzzle really goes out the window.  So many games come down to only being able to purchase one of 3 tiles, of which only one will fit in my puzzle.  And this is not because I'm not doing a good job filling up the board... it's mostly full. It's just a little lackluster and you really can't count on a certain shape coming around when you need it toward the end of the game.

Still a short game that provides something new/unique and can be enjoyable -- I'm just really unimpressed and a little frustrated with the endgame.

A fresh 9 for Uwe's third Lookout two player series. This game has ridiculously simply rules but an infinite number of ways to play the game. There is a jigsaw puzzle element to this game as players try to arrange their quilt patches on their cloth sheet. The more pieces you can fill, the fewer negative scores you will count at the end of the game. Simple, but highly entertaining. With a few plays thus far, this game stands at a nine. O

I've enjoyed playing this game a lot. There's something satisfying about laying down oddly shaped bits of fabric (tiles) and trying to fill in the grid. I like the clever use of buttons as currency as well as having a limited selection of shapes to buy each turn, giving the game a little variety each time you play, forcing you to plan ahead and hope your opponent doesn't take what you want!

Pros: unique tile placement and/or puzzle mechanic, easy to learn, quick playtime

Cons: limited strategic & tactical options, no player interaction, can be swingy, low level of replayability

Easy to learn with intuitive rules and elegant flow, this is a good two-player filler game that fits right into an enjoyable, relaxing evening with the wife. For what it sets out to do, it is great, but I prefer games with more player interaction. It can also feel a little repetitive--I have never desired to play it back-to-back. My other complaint is that sometimes there's some significant point swings, depending on opportunities to get higher-valued tiles and the 7x7 special tile, which can be susceptible to a lot of luck.

The theme is a bit silly for a grown man to to be competing to knit the best quilt, but it creates one of the most entertaining 2 player games I've played.  I've always loved the time mechanism that's present here, it works elegantly in this game, but perhaps lacks the strategic decisions it provides in Thebes: Tomb Raider.  

Really enjoy the spacial element of plotting your tetris-like quilt and planning ahead, trying to get into the head of the other player.

*Really* enjoying this one. I can't sing its praises enough. I don't love setting up the circle every time, but I also can't see a good alternative. I do worry that its depth is inaccessible. Already we've seen a shift from basically random play in the first game to more strategic play in subsequent games, but I'm worried this may plateau. 

I don't doubt game depth, but I do doubt its ability to be seen. Planning more than one or two moves ahead in this game is much more challenging than in a game like Chess.

good little 2p game with 2 kinds of "time track" mechanic I like

[+] the whole track of tile offers some very interesting choices (how much am I willing to pay, what am I giving up on the way, what possibilities am I opening for my oponent), the milestones (scoring, bonus) on the time track offer a second level of objectives, I like the spatial puzzle element of racing to fill a 7x7 area
[-] maybe I need to play more but it feels that some tiles are way better than other (mainly those that cost very little time) because the cost of not filling up your board is so high that you have to get has many tiles as possible, and the only way to do that is to get a bunch of cheap -in terms of time- ones

Theme is nice and unique, but unfortunately it's paper thin.  Though there are interesting mechanisms here, the whole is rather dry.  There are some juicy opportunities for tactical play, but it's really difficult to set them up, and is more about capitalizing on them when your opponent sets them up for you.  The whole is rather more aggressive and interactive than the small box size would lead you to believe.  I don't have much cause to play short, two-player games, and I find myself pushing for a longer, more in-depth title when this gets suggested.

So my wife would often joke about acquiring Patchwork, and I would vociferously protest in response. "A quilting game?? Ha ha...no." But then, after reading so many glowing reviews, I finally decided to capitulate. The game definitely has a certain level of appeal to me--it is Tetris-like, so it is rather satisfying when all but a few of the squares on my board are filled in at game's end. On the other hand, when I end the game with -10 points, I feel like the true quilting novice that I am. I wouldn't hesitate to play this game occasionally, but it's not one that I would include among my top choices for lighter games.

Patchwork is a cross between spatial puzzle and economic snowball, but despite those two completely self-absorbed elements the game achieves a pleasant level of interaction due to the time-based turn order mechanism previously seen in Thebes and Neuland. I'm impressed- the game squeezes a lot of depth out of very few moving parts. I suspect Patchwork will actually get better with repeated plays as players become more comfortable with the spatial puzzle and can increasingly turn their focus to the tactical battle over tile selection. I'd like to own this game.

Do you like tetris? Then you should get this game! A lot of strategy in a small box based on the logic of tetris. Which piece should I get? The one that is expensive in buttons or the one that will cost me more time? Or should I just surpass my opponent to obtain more buttons and that single tile? I love the interaction and the thinking that you have to do in order to plan your next moves (if the opponent acts the way he is supposed to) as well as the goal of creating a 7X7 square to get the 7 points which is a huge advantage in the end. I think that it could have been designed for more players (at least 2 more). For its price, it's a bargain!

I bought this game to play with my wife with the objective to get her introduced into boardgames. Since the theme is patchwork and not fantastic worlds I thought that she would more interested, and it worked! My wife enjoyed it a lot :)

The game is clever, and original, basically you have to build a puzzle (fill a 9x9 table) with pieces that you buy each time. A feature of the game I like is that you don´t play one move each turn, instead, the player that is last on the path always plays, so it makes you choose carefully what piece you buy. 

The pieces of the puzzle have several characteristics which make them more or less interesting  1) the shape of the piece 2) number of bottoms on the piece (more bottoms will generate more income during the game), number of spaces you will be forced to advance on the board (the smaller the better), 3) cost of the piece.

It is a very easy game to play but still interesting one.

RATING: 9
This is an incredibly elegant design. I really appreciate that with simple use of two factors: time and buttons it manages to create a rich feeling of strategy and highly tactical play while generating its own small economy/engine building feel. All that and it only takes a couple of minutes to explain.

I certainly didn't see this one coming. An Uwe Rosenberg game about quilt making. It has none of the usual modern Uwe trappings either. No worker placement, no resource swapping or anything else we've gotten used to in the last few years. The main mechanic is basically a tile drafting tetris game, set up like a big rondel made up of all the pieces. On your turn, you can buy one of the next three pieces in front of the pawn to add to your quilt. If you can't, then you pass and collect some money. That's really all there is to it.

It is super fast and quite addicting. A perfect nightcap or lunch break game, for sure.

This just feels like tetris the boardgame.  I love how the game just flows so well and finding the right move in order for every piece to just fit perfectly is awesome.  I love the mechanic of jumping so far for the piece you want, or in order to block you opponent from purchasing the piece they need, it just adds a whole other level of strategy in the game.

RATING: 9
Fantastic game, very well designed. The theme would normally never appeal to me, but the mechanics are solid. Bought it, and then played with my mum, who then proceeded to steal my copy :P

The only issue is that the tile setup can be a bit messy and there if you get a bad tile setup it can prevent players from being able to buy tiles for several turns. I would recommend that tiles are placed into a bag and drawn one by one to ensure randomness.

I played the prototype at GenCon 2014 and enjoyed it a lot. Fitting all the pieces onto the player board presents an interesting challenge; it's satisfying when an odd-shaped piece fits perfectly into an open space. I appreciate that it's competitive yet not combative. If I had more opportunity to make use of 2-player games, I'd probably rate this higher.
Edit: I now have the retail version, and solitaire variants have been posted, so I've raised my rating.

Good fun for two. Won this game when I finished second in a board game quiz, believe it or not. Don't think I would've spent the dough on it otherwise, but I'm still glad I own it. Even got my mom to play and enjoy it, and that's an astonishing accomplishment. After a few plays, it's easy to figure out what the best strategy is at any given time. The tricky part is to construct your quilt in such a way as to cover as much of your player board as possible. That's easier said than done.

Played a borrowed copy of this with everyone in the family. A beautifully designed and balanced game, where you buy fabric swatches of different shapes to fill out your "quilt". It's like Tetris, except the shapes are much more varied, and other decisions come into play. The mechanics of turns, purchasing, gaining income, and scoring are incredibly well thought-out, and make for an easy to learn, and easy to play game. My family doesn't like games that are too "thinky", and they all loved this one. We gave it back to our neighbors who loaned it to us, and we immediately missed it.

Wonderful 2 player game with a cute quilting theme. Figuring out the "best" piece isn't usually the hardest part.

A bit of an oddball for me. I like the concept and generally enjoy playing, but if my opponent is taking it seriously the turns can drag and it kills it for me.

Look at it like this, in my head I view the game almost like actual Tetris. Because of this I make my piece choice as best I can while trying to keep it as fast as possible, so I could end up with some sub optimal choices/placements (which is fine), and I find the thrill of it quite fun. But when matched with an opponent who takes 3+ minutes per turn to carefully decide on which piece they're going to take I shutdown and it starts to become hair pullingly long.

So I think it's a good game overall, and I feel that either approach is perfectly fine. You can really make this game to be whatever you want, but just be sure that you'll be playing with someone who's approaching it the same as you.

A wonderful, fast two player game that I believe belongs in everyone's collection because of its simple, elegant design that offers a rich, deep gameplay experience in a such a short time.  This is truly one of Uwe's best games.  The Tetris style pieces remind me of building in Amerigo.  This game has interesting choices to make.  The resources in my opinion are buttons (which are points and currency), time, and space on your board.  Every empty space at the end of the game is -2 points so sometimes you take tiles that are larger but don't give you a good payout on buttons or time during the game so that you can do a better job at filling your board spaces.  Buying tiles that cost a lot of time uses your time resource but allows you to get the 1 x 1 tiles before your opponent does.  Buying tiles with lots of button symbols can help you a lot during the early game because those symbols pay out every time you cross a blue button throughout the game but aren't as critical towards the end of the game when you're hoping to just fill up your board.  I love this game because you can also plan your moves ahead and hope that your opponent doesn't take that crucial tile you need.  Maybe the best bang for your buck game out there!  This game also has the added plus that it will more than likely appeal to your wife!  My wife really likes it!

Note: Includes real blue wooden buttons for currency.

A simple but elegant and quaint game. The rules are easy to understand but gameplay provides quite a challenge. Artwork is nice. Game component quality however, is average because the die-cut is off centre. 

To play well, one needs to plan ahead and watch out for what your opponent needs. There is also a need to balance between taking large pieces that are cheap without buttons and pieces that are costly but with buttons.

I thought I was gonna hate it when I ordered it. I was so wrong. It's easy to learn, easy to teach, quick to play, a spatial intelligence challenge, and it's beautiful. My only complaints are the setup, the fact that the 1x1 patches don't always fit nicely, and the fact that the components are cardboard. I'd have been willing to pay a bit more if the pieces had been sturdier. But that doesn't detract from my enjoyment.

This game is cute and charming. I want to share it with as many people as possible. It has a really fun theme that works for the mechanics. The gameplay is nice and comfy. Placing pieces feels like a puzzle, getting buttons feels like engine-building, drafting pieces takes strategy.
The main problem I see with this game is replayability as it really doesn't vary much each playthrough (starting tile configurations change nothing). After the one game I played of it i have no real desire to play again even though I had a lot of fun. I am not sure it is collection worthy, unless your looking for some comfy padding.

Great game. Lots of fun, pretty in an ugly way.  The wife likes it,  I prefer gipf series though.

A nice filler game, but not terribly exciting. As fillers go I would pick Biblios or Neolithic over this every time.

Visual spacial game, great for two, especially if you don't want to think too much, that said, you can totally attempt to count all the numbers in this game, if you feel so inclined, but good luck! A simple yet ingeniously deep game for what it asks of you. Bravo Uwe.

Very enjoyable 2 player game, straightforward simple decisions on when to buy and when to get 'money' with a puzzle element.

Fast game for two involving interesting decisions to fill a board with patches. Empty spots give high penalties so not so easy to score high. Lovely components.

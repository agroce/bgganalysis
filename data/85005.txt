The Boss reminds me of Reiner Knizia's Loco/Flinke Pinke/Quandary, in that you are investing in things (here it is gangland operations in various American cities) on the basis of information that is gradually revealed by card play during the round. The Boss adds a few twists. The first is Chicago, a city that gains in value in the course of the game. The second is that, in true mobster style, only the player who invests the most in a city gains the rewards. Finally, uncertain game length, which applies constant pressure to hit the front or stay there. 

I quite like the artwork of The Boss, production quality is good too.

An initial rating... I’ve only played this 2 player and I’m quite impressed. After my first play I thought this would be better at a 3+ player count but after recent plays I’m really starting to enjoy it with just 2. Admittedly I still haven’t played a 3+ player game so I may be missing out. In my two player games I think I prefer playing with just the 4 cities, it feels like a tighter game than playing with one of the 5 city options.

Neat little game that plays fast, and can travel along very easily.

Also, I just love how the bluffing mechanics blend in perfectly with a light area majority mechanism. Yes, it does have a bit more of random elements that I'd like, but in a game so short, it's really not an issue.

RATING: 6.8
Only just got this (September 2014). Very good medium filler. Actually, with four players, play time can be around an hour so maybe that means it doesn't qualify as a  filler. Fantastic game play if you like bluffing. Each round starts moderately easily but as it progresses the decisions get more difficult and interesting. Deciding when to use your minor gangsters and which card to play when you're down to only two produces nail-biting moments.
Like any game of bluff it probably helps if you know your opponents.
Small enough box to make it a travel game.

This is a surprisingly fun little filler based on area control, that works nicely with 3-4 players and I suspect could be quite bland with 2.

There is a bit of luck in the distribution of the cards (when you have many of the same city you have an advantage in becoming certain of the payout of the city earlier than others), but it is not a huge problem in a 45 min. game.

The elements of bluffing and deduction, with the right group (willing to take risks to trap other players) is, however, what makes The Boss stand as go to filler.

RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This card game has a fair amount of deduction and hidden information. Area control is performed by a form of auction with workers. The theme works surprisingly well and the components are solid. The game flows easily and doesn't  take too long to play. I can see it being pulled out at family gatherings.

My group didn't liked it too much but I think it's a good filler, maybe a little more than that, it's a little majorities game in which every area can provide different things each round and the information is partially hidden. 

It's a very original game, but maybe the main problem is that the gameplay it's a little cold.

*update*

After only one incomplete play more than one year ago I traded it away because my interest in exploring the game was zero... A pity but I prefer other fillers that also have the advantage of getting played in half the time...

Although I like the idea behind the bidding phase, and I think the deduction/timing aspect of the game is great, the game as a whole kind of falls flat for me. I really don't like how some players can get completely screwed turn after turn, possibly ending the game with zero points, even when other players can score 15-20 or more, lapping the others on the score track (which you can't even read!). Ultimately, it's an interesting collection of mechanics, but like Blackrock's other game, Blackrock City, this doesn't really stand on its own as a full game.

This is a good, fun, game of bluff and double bluff - but with enough public and semi-public information to make that an entertaining challenge rather than just blind bidding.

I previously owned the edition from 2-4 players and have now "upgraded" it to the new edition with 2-6 players and additional cards which add to the variety.

Let me say straight up that this is an underrated and underappreciated game! It's such a tense game, and it always feels like you only want to play a single card and then keep the rest until the other players have revealed all of their cards... It's so hard to pick which card to play each round! I looove this feeling, even though it borders frustration! Also, the way the cards are distributed each round is genius as you might know a lot about some cards and nothing about others or a little about everything. It's a delicate matter of then playing the game AND playing your opponents...

Each cube really matters as you don't have a lot of them (9 in total, and 3 of those are one-time use!), so you have to use them carefully and not spread too thin - after all, this game is about getting the majority in different cities (i.e. differently colored cards), so you have to focus on a few cards - of course, you only have limited knowledge due to the card distribution among the players, so you have to be clever.

I really like the variation the different cards provide. Sure, some of the cards are a bit alike, but then there are cards like the white card which can really change the game if you get vanished from that in the first round. Or the orange (expansion) card where every losing player on that card loses a cube/mobster! And the green/brown cards are great as they are very tense; high risk, but you might get a high reward!
The Al Capone card is a quite clever mechanism which alters the gameplay slightly from round to round. And the card adds an extra layer of complexity as you need to think about the last card you play (won't go into detail, but if you've played the game, you know what I mean, and if you haven't, well, as I said, it adds an extra later of complexity).

The endgame is interesting as well as you never know whether the game lasts 3, 4 or 5 rounds; and this can change the strategy slightly. Not sure I like it too much, and I feel like 5 rounds is maybe one too many if playing with 4+ players. It's not like it's dragging a lot, but after all each round plays out fairly similarly. Also, it can have an impact of the punishment of some of the cards; e.g. if you get sent to the hospital or in jail, you lose a cube for a round or two. That's quite a long time if the game only lasts 3 rounds, which is not revealed until the third round. Except for this, I thoroughly enjoy this tense game!

After 1 play @ 4 players

A nice deduction game where you try to figure out if the face down card is worth bidding on. To accomplish this task, you know the cards in your hand and the colors of the cards other players know. Then you try to make your big move to outbid for a city without drawing attention to yourself. A fun game that comes in a small package. Really need to play at the max player count otherwise it's going to feel like too much is being left to chance.

The Boss is a solid, light semi-blind bidding game. Players bid for mobster control of several American cities with varying profit margins. The actual returns of any particular city only get revealed piece by piece throughout a round so there's some gambling and bluffing involved. The importance of those is downplayed a lot by often very similar payouts, however. I almost can't believe I'm saying this, but I think the game might actually be too balanced and would benefit from a bit more chaos and swings of fortune.

Love this game. Relatively short playtime, and not tons of decisions to make. That being said, lots of strategy and/or bluffing involved. Very fun and intense game, but easy to pick up and play. 

Edit: Dec/6/13. Have been playing this a ton lately, since I introduced it to a few more gamers. It's surprisingly addictive. The only reason it's not really a 10, is the tie breaking method in the rule book. It basically gives the game to the person who did best in the last round played. We're looking at a house rule to bypass it.

Card deduction/majority game with bluffing and a lot of backstabbing? 

Watching, might needs tweaks.

RATING: 5
Based on 1 play, 4 players.

The game components and artwork, especially the signature obtained at Essen, are all really nice.

I did not find the theme engaging though others did and for a deduction game I prefer Old Town.

Still, not a bad game, just not one I need to own (or play too often).

Initial Rating: 6.5 (October 2013)

At last I got to play this fabled game. It has simple rules but the decisions are very interesting, I really liked it and I want to play again soon. The playtime is short and it can be explained under 5 minutes. I love majority games AND bluffing games so I think this game will rise up higher in my personal ratings.

Most likely I will buy it, it is the perfect game to finish (or begin) our gaming sessions.

A lot in a little package.  A game of deduction, bluffing and area control. Each turn you must decide whether or not to commit your agents to a city and what information to give the other players.  Going last is a large advantage.  The last player has all the information and can commit his agents without risk.  Each round the order shifts one player to the left.  When you are the last player, you better score some points.

I bought it for cheap at Essen 2012 due to the good ratings although it didn't interest me thematically or gameplay wise on its release. After playing it, I consider it overrated.
The Boss is a simple game of majorities and bluffing. Players put gangsters in one of several cities. One out of the specific cards for each city is laid down secretly beneath it. The rest of the cards are in the hands of the players and played out openly to the cities one by one allowing increasingly better guesses as for the hidden reward. After all cards are played, whoever has the most gangsters in this city gets the loot (or bad results like being arrested, banned, hospitalized or even shot) from the secret card. This is repeated three to five times.
In our round of seasoned Eurogamers the game turned out to be a dragging optimization exercise with long pondering on each move. Not without reason, the gamebox mentions 20-60 minutes as time to play. The Boss is probably better suited to a trash-talking spontaneous group of players.

The Boss is a logic puzzle.  You slowly give and receive information about which card is hidden for each of the cities and at the same time try to achieve the majority of gangsters in the cities that you think will give you points.

The problem with this game is that it is too light to be a real game, but too heavy to be a light game.  When I have time for a real game, I'd rather play something that has more meat.  If it is filler time, I gravitate more towards Dixit, Love letter, or Coup.

That said, The Boss is a good game.  The penalty for being stuck with a dud is a bit excessive.  Get shot and the game is pretty much over.  Personally, I would have more "one use" meeples to allow for more flexibility.

Greatly underrated little game.  Easy to teach, very accessible with light but deep mechanics.  There's guessing, deduction, double-blind, bluffing, area control, all in a package that plays fast and can easily be played by non-gamers.  This is a seriously must-have filler.

RATING: 6
This is a solid filler with some interesting stuff going on in the box.  There is a mix of deduction, bluffing, and pushing your luck as you try to figure out which town will produce the most money.  Chicago is a nice touch with how the mobster with the most pawns there wins half the money of the cards to the left (and Chicago keeps moving to the right in the city cards each round).  There is also a chance for your mobsters to get jailed (lose two turns with one of your mobsters), hospitalized (lose one turn with one of your mobsters), or get whacked (lose a mobster for remainder of game).  Heck, you can even hire temp workers but like one would expect, they can only go where there is one of your regulars to show them what to do and they only help once and then they are gone...:-)

E' un gioco che mi ha sempre messo in difficoltà, E' facile da spiegare e da apparecchiare, ma quando sarete costretti a rivelare informazioni preziose al vostro avversario, o a mandare gangster dove non sapete cosa vi aspetta vi metterà ansia e vi farà rosicare parecchio... Genera adrenalina ed è molto molto bastardo. Nonostante abbia vinto una sola partita su una quindicina fatte è un gioco che mi piace tantissimo...

RATING: 8
The game is severely underrated.  It inhabits a rare space of being light and fast to play, with strategic depth, much of which comes from the social aspect, with healthy doses of deduction, bluffing, and risk management.  It's also very portable.

Trading:  

In overall good condition. The cards are not plastic coated, and consequentially have picked up tiny spots of dirt over time (like old playing cards do), varying from a little to a lot. To me they don't detract much while playing, but a perfectionist might not feel the same way.

03/13/12 Played a two-player game. I liked the mechanics of The Boss, though I find the theme unsavory. I gave it a provisional rating. That may go up if/when I play it with three or four. For there are certain aspects I didn't get to see today: four more cities, being banished from a city, and some police cards.  
05/08/12 Played most of a four-player game. Alas I can't say that made any difference to my initial impression.

Tense filler that combines area control and deduction in a very fresh way. Maybe a tad repetitive overall, but the game play is very visceral. Kind of reminds me of a less chaotic version of Council of Verona. If this game had just a little more in the components department to help it "pop," I think this could be a keeper. Unfortunately, it feels like a pretty niche game overall.

Family Game leggero ma non privo di strategia e deduzione. Meccaniche ben congegnate e pochissimi tempi morti. Perde tantissimo in 2 giocatori, mentre in 3 e 4 è molto divertente. Materiali, buoni e poco ingombranti, un buon filler (dura più di 30') da portarsi appresso. Un buon gioco e una bella scoperta. Esiste una espansione, consigliata, che porta a 5 il numero massimo di giocatori.

There's no mistaking the Banana Republic lineage on this one. There's 7 suits (and that tells you something, that I just think of them as suits, not gangster families for whatever the tacked on marketing theme is) and each suit has good cards (score points) and bad cards (lose a betting token). You're betting on which 1 card has been placed face-down in each suit. All the other cards are spread amongst the players and are played out one at a time so with each round of play more information comes out as to what the face-down cards are not. Each time you play a card you can place betting chips on a suit as well, and whoever places the highest bet on a suit wins whatever the last card is, be it good or bad (ok, it's majority, not a bet, but to my mind, you generally don't know for sure what the last card will be, so you're betting it's good). You only have certain knowledge if you're holding the last card in a suit, but that only helps you if the card or cards you're holding are bad cards (implying that the face-down card is good). So there's huge luck in whether you draw bad cards (which is good), what other players choose to play out first and if you're going last in turn order. If you get crap cards which don't tell you much, or don't lead you to a guaranteed good result, then you're led towards gambling on other suits - and if someone has certain (good) information on that suit, you'll just get massively outbid anyway. I just found it a frustrating game with little drama. You either get lucky with your cards or not. You get lucky with your guess bids or not. You get lucky on whether other people overbid you or a competitor when they have a choice. There are decisions along the way on how to play your cards out and how to bid; but they just felt overwhelmed by other things. And then you have to play the same game 2, 3 or 4 more rounds to (I guess) try and even these things out. Having effectively played it 4 times in 1 game, I don't feel the need to venture this way again.

The basic idea is not bad, albeit nothing new or innovative. However, I feel that the game is either broken or terribly unpolished, The way players are distributing their cubes amongst the cities just does not feel right. You should not be allowed to pass and just wait for others to move first, unless their is either a benefit in going first or a penalty in going last. As it stands, I do not like this game, because I think they did not playtest and polish it thoroughly.

RATING: 7
This is a fun game where you do not want to play a card. But at your turn you have to! And with revealing a card you are giving away information.

On the table you will find some city cards with printed on them the possible revenues. Each possible revenue is represented by a card. Before the round starts one card is placed closed under a city card. That card is the income for the player who controlls the city. There are also negative revenues, like a killed gangster from your gang or prison time for one of your buddies.
Each time one card gets played there is more information what is not the lute of the town so you can deduct to what it is.
What is also very nice in this game is that players can see who has cards from what city. Each city has it's own colour card backs.

Nice bluffing game where being last in player order can really matter.

RATING: 6
June 2016: Upgrade from 5 to 6.

The "flaws" in this game is that the game feels samey from round to round and induces more AP than expected for such a light game.

What raised it from 5 to 6? I just realized that you're not obliged to place a cube; it's worth it sometimes to play chicken. Also I didn't realize the special rule about the last turn of the game (turn order changes from clockwise to number of cubes left).

Sept 2011: Short, light deduction game.

Extra points for coming in a small box and not requiring excessive note taking (like so many other deduction games).

It feels a little bit like a trick-taking game in terms of each player trying to discover which card in each suit is missing through card play. (BTW, not at all deep as most trick taking games because you cannot force your opponents to play a certain card.)

Um bom jogo de aposta e dedução. Flui bem e gera uma interação divertida entre os jogadores.

Jogo leve, um ótimo filler!

RATING: 8
Great game of quasi-bluffing. Each player has limited information about the contents (points) in each location, and you take turns bidding on the locations and revealing more and more information. The trick is, depending on the order you reveal your info, you can suggest that certain locations are much more lucrative than they really are.

I took a chance importing this game and I am extremely satisfied. The 6-player expansion breaks players into teams and works wonderfully. This will be one of my #1 light/filler games in the future

Nice little bidding and bluffing game that doesn't outstay its welcome if you can knock it off in 30-40 minutes. There's not a lot of deduction here - none to speak of really. What you have is a hidden value or penalty that will reveal itself over the five turns in a round as each player has the option to bid and then must reveal a piece of the puzzle by playing one of their five starting cards. Therein lies the opportunity to gamble or bluff with your bidding. It's quite entertaining doing so if a decent pace is maintained throughout. A game lasts 15-25 turns depending upon the draw of the shield cards, and it's this game length uncertainty as well as the last turn bidding order rule (where players with the most mobsters left have to go first), that spices things up nicely. It's a solid little game that'll entertain the light auction gamers who enjoy a little twist, a bluff and a gamble. Good stuff.

RATING: 7
Little mean, exciting and well thought auction game with a lot of bluffing. Players initially have partial information of the things that are being auctioned and some of them could (or not) be bad for them. As the round progresses they become able to complete most of the picture, but at that time it could be too late and there is always a chance to fool other players and make them take poor options. Even the end of the game is not clear, since it could end as soon as in the third round, or as late as in the fifth.

Played once with 4P. The Boss is a mixture of bluffing and auctions, which reminds me a little of Felix: The Cat in the Sack. There are several auctions going on at once, with players holding different information for different auctions. 

This is a surprisingly cerebral game as players have to carefully choose which cards they want to reveal, and when to bid for a city. As a result, our onr game took 75 minutes to complete. Also, the points gained were incremental, with players scoring 3-4 points a turn. I'm interested to try out more games to see if the playing time and scores are the norm.

There's both more than meets the eye and less. It's hard to wrap your head around the game at first, but once you do, you realize that it's a lot less about bluffing than deduction--and then, once everyone understands this, luck. In the end, there might be too much thought involved for such a luck-driven game because the deduction is simultaneously too laborious and too easily perfected.

1 play, 2er

It's an interesting little game! There's deduction, bluffing, and area-majority in a quick-playing card game. I'd be willing to play it again, but it's probably better with more players (more gangsters come into play, with different card powers and distributions). For two, I'm pretty sure I prefer Love Letter (which I haven't tried yet with more than 2).

--- Summary ---
Each player starts with 6 large cubes and 3 small ones. You place a number (based on the number of players) of gangster cards on display, each with a unique combination of cards associated with them. These are either numbered or have an icon on them. Cards, each with one of these icons in each of the gangster colors, are all shuffled together; then, place one card under each gangster, matching its color (e.g., a gangster's deck may have 1, 2, 3, 4, gun; one of these 5 will be placed face down under the gangster card). The rest of the cards are divided evenly between players.

On your turn, place 0+ cubes on a gangster (may only use your small cubes if you already have large cube on that gangster; if another player's cubes are there already, your new cube count must exceed theirs); then play one card face up under the matching gangster. Alternate until all cards are played. Then resolve each gangster: the player with more cubes on the card gets as many points as the face down card number (or, resolve the icon; eg gun kills one of your large cubes - remove from game). After all gangsters resolved, all your played small cubes are removed from the game; large cubes come back to you.

Start player rotates, then repeat above. There's a variable game end condition (3-5 hands) where at some point each hand (when someone is down to 2 cubes) you reveal a card from the Police deck. Each card has a colored shield. When you draw the third of a color (?), the game ends at the end of the hand. Most VP wins (tiebreaker = player who earned most points on final round).

The Boss is da boss.  It is an extremely clever little game of deduction, bluffing, and area control, all wrapped up in a tight, little, easy-to-learn, quick-playing package.  This game is nothing like Mr. Jack, yet to me it is reminiscent of Mr. Jack due to the above-mentioned elements, the fact that there is more to this brilliant collection of wood and cardboard than might meet the eye after just a play or two, and the fact that my overall enthusiasm level comes close to matching that of its deduction predecessor.  The card art is cool, although there is nothing special about the rest of the components.  In fact, I think the affection I have for this game can be seen in all the custom components that I have put together for it to enhance the visual experience.  I guess the only limitation with the game is the player count, since while I have played quite a few games with 3 and 4 players, I don't imagine the 2-player experience would be nearly as enjoyable.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

[Blackrock Editions 2010 edition] {Mafia; bluffing, double-guessing, speculation; optimal 4p}  The Boss is a very fun game, full of interaction, bluffing and tactical decisions.  Very fun.

It's easy to learn the rules, though with some fiddly rules (Chicago placement, etc.)  However, players can learn the game quickly.

The game component quality is good.  It's better if the publisher uses standard-size cards.  The design (wooden cubes) of Experts and Occassionals is too abstract.  I would rather the publisher uses discs with stickers.

Nice game, with some nice bluffing mechanics and deduction. Played with four and had a request to replay, while everyone at least enjoyed himself.

Took us about an hour for first play, which isn't that bad. Should be a good filler if we require something more meaty as King of Tokyo for our spare 40 minutes.

Not sure I'm keeping this around though, as I have more games in that category. So I'm unsure how often this will actually hit the table again.

So, overall decision: good designed game, fine components and artwork, good interlocking mechanics. Game-play wise it seems to be prone to AP players that HAVE to optimize every move.

Decision pending.

The game obviously has some deduction and metering of information that the players can control. Still, if you have a lot of information, you can't use it because you'll spread your forces to widely; yet, it's possible to have absolutely no useful information, and your forces are useless. So, despite the illusion of control, it's somewhat bait & switch: a high luck game I don't find very interesting.

A surprisingly fun and decent heavy-filler which is flying under the radar at the moment. Haven't even heard of the publisher, but certainly worth a look. The game is semi-blind bidding with partial hidden information slowly revealed by card play. It did remind me of Ys, though only superficially. Players try to bluff their way through accumulating loot by revealing a hand of cards that slowly eliminate the possibilities of either a hidden treasure or bad event (prison/hospital). During the process of revealing the information, players place cubes on different cities in a traditional area majority fight for control of each turf. The game is fast-paced and "back-stabby" enough to garner some thrills and surprises along the way. I certainly enjoyed the player interaction. The one concern I have is the balance at the end of the game where the leader of the pack may play it safe by nursing the lead. However, we tried breaking the game by nursing a lead without any success, suggesting perhaps the game is more balanced than we originally thought.

As others have stated, a better game than Cargo Noir.  Has multiple elements that fit the theme - putting your meeples in jail, hospital, killing them off, even the cops showing up and ending the game - that are so severely lacking in Cargo Noir.

This game is in serious need of chrome, however.  If it had been produced to the level of Cargo Noir I'd grade this a 9 or better.  The instructions are also a bit of a mess and not very coherent.  Had to read reviews here to understand what should have been fairly simple.

RATING: 5
An interesting mix of deduction and area majority, in a quick filler game package. The game revolves around players taking turns playing single cards face up, slowly giving information to the table about what card is stashed under each city card. After exposing one of their cards, players may then move any number of their influence cubes to a city card. After everyone has played all their cards, the player with the most influence in each city takes reveals the stashed card and claims the cash reward depicted on the card.

Unless it was a trap card, of which there are one or two in each City suit, in which case you suffer the consequences.

It's cute and certainly enjoyable enough for what it is. I don't think there's quite enough here for it to break into my filler rotation though.

Amazing game of bidding and deduction. Also, mafia. Each turn, you MAY place a few of your goons on a spot to control that area, adhering to the rule that if enemy cubes are there, you must exceed their numbers by at least one. Whether you place your goons or not, you MUST play one of the five precious cards in your hand, all of which give everyone information. This info lets you deduce what is at each location, whether it be points or bad stuff. There is just so much to like here, all in a small, stream lined package. Love it.

Game rules are simple and therefore easy to teach and learn. Game time is reasonably short. Player interaction is high, with lots of bluffing and guessing. Game mechanic to determine the number of hands to play is particularly innovative. The team game variant is more intriguing than the individual game.

Artwork is fine and game component quality is ok. The game is also scalable and replayable, due to the inclusion of different number of cities for different player counts and different setups of cities for each player count.

My most pleasant surprise find of SPIEL '10. Great game, with fantastic replay value. I love how they solved the starting player disadvantage by changing the turn order for the last card played of each hand. That the game last a random 3-5 rounds is also great, and works very well during play.

[i]"I am not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you."[/i]

There's a lot of bluffing and second guessing in this game, if you like that sort of thing, you will love [thing=85005]The Boss[/thing]!

The game is arguably best with four players as then all the Character and City Cards are in play, and area control games are simply more enjoyable the more players you have jockeying for position.

[thing=85005]The Boss[/thing] makes you laugh, curse and grit your teeth as you consider your next move, or in reaction to the plays of your opponents. This is the kind of game where players immediately request to play it again.

One player that I suckered into playing [thing=85005]The Boss[/thing] with us quipped in happy frustration, "I hate this type of game, I must buy it." :)

This is a game of majority and deduction. You have to place gangster on the city-card to win the blind placed card below. After the player has placed his gangsters (cubes) on the city, the have to place a card below the city of the corresponding color of the played card. On the cities is shown, which cards are in play. By deduction, you will know step by step for which card you’re playing. When a player wins a card, it’s turned face up, and the players wins money-bags, gets in the hospital, or a gangster gets shot. Player with the most money bags at the end of the game wins.

This game works with two. But it’s not great, as the deduction part is very easy, and you will know pretty quick for which card you’re playing. It’ll show it’s potential with three players, and will shine with 4 players. Nice components, although the cubes could have been replaced with little gangster meeples. Ok, quick game with 2. Fun game with 3. Great filler game with 4.

Very good card game that combines deduction, bluffing, bidding ; although the mafia theme isn't that strong.

After 1 play: Flat out, does not work with 2 players.  It might be better with more, but I doubt I'll ever try.

This feels like a souped up  "Loco!/Quandary/Thor". The theme is thin but fun, and it works well. The push-your-luck and partial info gameplay is very well done, and while the game could run a bit long by 10-20 minutes on occasion, I'll pretty much pick this one over "Loco!" every time now.

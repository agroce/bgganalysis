Based on the reviews, the components and the graphics of this game I was really excited! The idea of the action cards seemed nice and I had no games with this mechanism. The event cards also looked a very good addition to an eurogame, but mostly I liked the idea of a board taking life with new buildings appearing every now and then. When I finally played it, it was just ok and it didn't get better after other plays.

I have two major problems with this game. The first is: the small proportions. I don't like that, no matter which strategy I'm taking, the proporsions of what I'm doing are so small. There's no point in this game, when you feel like you accomplished something relevant. It lacks of that excitement. Then the second problem joins the first: the punishing events and the taxes. These two thing together make the game very harsh and diminish the proportions of the game even more!

World Without End is not bad at the end of the day, but it's for sure nothing special. It feels so constricting to the point of being frustrating... it just isn't exciting.

A very beautiful game, graphically speaking, and in just about every other sense of the word. It is not exactly "dripping with theme", but it certainly has received a light soaking. I haven't read the book (but know the general plot outline), and let me assure you: you sure don't have to know the book to enjoy the game! I had no feeling whatsoever of being immersed in the novel, but certainly felt like I had waded up to my knees in the general setting (late Mediaeval England when everything started to go REALLY wrong!).
And everything going wrong is a good way to describe your typical turn! This is NOT a strategic game (although some strategy can be useful, now and then) but rather an ongoing tactical struggle for survival. The random events (taken from the book) add randomness, and yet (strangely enough!) World Without End doesn't seem at all like a luck driven game. Decision making (from a multitude of options) is constant, and the tension level is deliciously exquisite. The rules are easy to catch on to, but actual game play is very hard, because of the uncertainty as to what you should do.
One major flaw with the game is that there isn't a great deal of player interaction, but it would be pushing it to say that World Without End is "multi-player solitaire": not quite.

The game is rather easy to play and it is just not happening a lot.

I played again, long after the first two games and the game is still fun, still interesting. I am decreasing my rating to 9 though, because of the houses building mechanism - there are events that affect the houses owners (and I saw this in 4 consecutive games)and no one else, making the houses a big random factor that can be the fine line between winning and coming second.

For me it worked out well, 2 houses = 8 points/turn, but for everyone else it did not. This is pretty much the only flaw in the game I saw so far.

It still rocks.

Like PotE, beautifully illustrated by Michael Menzel.  Again Michael Rieneck and Stefan Stadler have faithfully followed the book (and I thought WWE was a much more mature book than PotE, but I imagine a harder task to convert into a board game).  PotE is a favourite game of mine, especially as it plays six well with the expansion.  Happily I got to play WWE without having to part with my money - and won't be doing so.  The random card events and their 'take that' nature were not much fun for me.  The game was too short for players to develop fully, but long enough for me to not unhappy it was over.  A disappointment.

Good, good, good!  Very entertaining, fast, plays smooth, and it is just beautiful.  Although the desing reminds strongly The Pillars of the Earth, the game has absolutely NOTHING to do with it.  This one combines resource management with card-use management, and includes a meta-game inside about the positioning of the event card, which is fun and original.  Many ways to score, all seem to be good ways.  Since it has different events each game, it should be quite replayable.

I wasn't sure how I would react to this game, because geekbuddies described it as a game that revolves around managing pain. Sure enough that is exactly what it is, a game where every turn there is a chance an event card could devastate your plans. It felt like I was constantly wanting to do everything, and yet the game limits and restricts you in such a way that you have to prioritize what is most vital to your plans. Despite the potential for frustration, I quite like this game. It challenges my mind in a different way from other games because it continuously forces you to look at what is more important: scoring points towards victory, or fighting to avoid losing points by gathering the necessary items to pay the mandatory dues. My one concern is that the nature of the game almost forces a close score, but it will take more exploration of the game before I can conclusively determine if this is true. It's not a game that I will play all that frequently, and I can see some of my family and friends being totally enraged by the game, but I am anxious to play again.

If board game design is ever studied as a science, this game will be the model example of the concept that mashing a bunch of clever mechanics together doesn't guarantee a fun game. This game is the quintessence of "boring." There is absolutely nothing to get excited about in this game, ever. In the last round, you're gathering resources to avoid starvation at the same rate as you were in the first round. Here and there you score some victory points, and the game ends.

The problem is that the mechanics don't work. Medical knowledge? Useless. Endorsement seals? Totally useless. Building materials? If building projects never come up, useless. What am I supposed to get excited about?

An interesting game of hand management.  It's very different from Pillars of the Earth.  I like the card play mechanism whereby you must pick both a card to play and a card to discard.  Seems to be important to contribute to the buildings regularly because 6 points is a lot for contributing 2 cubes.  

The 3-player game feels broken, though, because the turn order never changes (i.e. same person goes last every round) which could be an advantage.

Reputed to be the better of the two (Pillars of the Earth and this), I was quite engaged and found the game interesting and stimulating. Not quite a "worker placement" game but with the feel of one, sort of. Limited actions, "must have" commodities that distract you from the business of building VPs, it reminds me of a lot of games but with a few new twists and turns. My first play impressed with the smoothness of the design and the ease with which you become immersed in the dynamics of the game. Need to play more to see if there is a "puzzle" aspect to successful play. Not sure I need my own copy of this yet but I'm glad to see it "in the family." I expect to see more plays of this one...
+++++++
A couple of plays in and I'm still impressed. The variety provided by the variable event card draws and the constant tension maintained by the action card choices make for quite an engaging game. A game that is this easy to teach but with surprising depth of play, within a 2 to 2 1/2 hr playing time, makes it definite a "keeper." I'm upping my rating...

Se supone que continua la saga iniciada con Los pilares de la tierra. Salvo el estar basado en una novela del mismo autor y que comparten ilustrador (genial, por cierto), la verdad es que no tienen muchas cosas en común.

La partida se desarrolla en cuatro capítulos de seis rondas cada uno. En cada ronda, un jugador escoge una carta de evento. Luego la carta se orienta y según la orientación le otorga algún beneficio a todos los jugadores, y además, un beneficio extra al jugador activo (una mecánica muy interesante) y después hay que ir jugado cartas de acción. Hay doce disponibles... y cada vez que juegas una, has de descartar otra. Las acciones están encaminadas a conseguir recursos para:
a) obtener puntos de victoria
b) conseguir cumplir los requisitos obligatorios al final de cada capítulo.

En mi opinión, es mejor juego que los pilares de la tierra. En todo momento tienes muchas cosas que hacer y muchas formas de conseguir lo que quieres. El jugador se pasa toda la partida en un duro debate interno.  Hay multitud de caminos a la victoria, que como siempre, obtiene quien más puntos de victoria tiene en su haber al finalizar el cuarto capítulo. Es una pena que sólo sea para cuatro... para cinco hubiera lucido más.

I know that this isn't Pillars of the Earth (which I really like), but I was hoping some of the elements would carry over.  They didn't.

The game is really fiddly.  It needs some trims.  There are several actions that really don't have much point.  In our game, the buildings didn't come out, so that eliminated quite a few actions.  And really what does the cloth/wool element add to the game?  Yes, it's one of the few sources of money, but it doesn't seem as integrated into the game.

Plus every action gets you two points here, two points there.  Doesn't really build, just two points here and there, except maybe medical knowledge.

So I was disappointed, nonetheless.

I quite liked this game. Feels a bit like ItYotD and Notre Dame in that you must prepare for the unavoidable disasters while trying to rack up as many points as possible. It looks like an expansion is on the works (the board seems incomplete, like in Pillars). Components are top notch.

At first, it seemed promising...alas it did not last. The anxiety of loss and punishment is reminiscent of In the Year of the Dragon and Agricola. But that is where the similarities end. The game quickly degenerated into random chaos. We spent the last 2 epochs with no new buildings introduced, thus negating several actions.

No real meaning planning as some event cards are so powerful and randomly chaotic that at some times, players took one vp just to have something to do. 
 
Will not likely play this again.

It's longer than Pillars and there's definitely more going on but English rules would have been great and there was something we played totally wrong. As we played the game it was broken especially in the end.

The endless stream of games with action selection by card/token, collecting/changing resources and zero interaction becomes more and more annoying.

And the games become more and more uninspired. This one doesn't have a single idea worth mentioning.

For too long a time we were sitting at the table without caring a single moment what the others are doing. Playing with other people here is just a burden since it causes downtime without any notable effect on play.

Did I mention the randomness so many people complained about? It's there and there's a lot of it. Sometimes we like to play games with a good amount of randomness if there's fun involved. Did we have fun? Zero - rounded up!

12/11/09 - first 3er game was good but once again misunderstood the rules regarding the plagues - which is easy to do since the rules use three different words to explain the spot/chit(s) on the board, namely HOUSE, INHABITANT and LOCATION. Needless to say we scored 2 points per inhabitant (which my brain told me "It's the number on the chit - 3 inhabitants live in this house at this location = 6 points, plus the 2 bonus points for the house - total = 8 points.") WRONG - it's just 2 points per house PERIOD. Looking forward to another game.

How about World Without Decisions?  This went from love-it to "meh" faster than any game ever has.  At first, it seems perfectly balanced, with the event cards and semi-random nature of the income making for a fresh play every time.  It soon becomes apparent, though, that there is really no strategic play here - the game is pure tactics.  That might be fine in the 4er, where you are struggling against chance just to get something going, but in the 2er, you have too much control.  There is no pressure to do anything in particular, as the chapter-ending necessities (grain, piety) are easy enough to rustle up with 3 income choices, and the card actions limit you in terms of what you can accomplish otherwise (at best, do 2x the building or curing actions).  Since you can't plan for anything much (as income is basically a crap-shoot), the order in which you do things doesn't matter, so pretty much you do this, or do that, and no matter what you do, you'll end up in the same place.  Two out of three of our games ended in either a tie or half a point away from each other!  And we've never been hit with penance or any other end of the turn penalty - even if you can't make one of the payments, you'd have to be a dolt not to have finagled a loyalty to take care of it.  As is, this one feels much like 2-player Cuba - seemingly a lot of options, but no pressure to do anything.  Plus, the "flavor" text on the cards is pretty lame (reminiscent to my fiance of the lame trappings of Candamir).  This might be good for 4 (or 3) if you like a tactical struggle, but for 2, you will be bored to tears.  Might not be a bad gateway Euro, though.

Traded for Glory to Rome.

Mixed feelings. I love the directional placement for the event cards, which is very unique and made for some tough decisions. On the other hand, the events themselves were totally random, and usually seemed to punish some players over others, such that one player could shoot ahead easily while others were crippled for the rest of the chapter.

I have not read the books, so to us the theme seemed ridiculous. We're gathering resources to build public buildings, but we are also building houses for people and collecting rent, but we are also apparently doctors who go around curing patients with our medical knowledge? Whatever, I can get over that.

What I can't get over, however, is that the game is not great with two-players. The tower is too large to be easily built by two, and half the buildings are simply completed by the game itself at the end of chapters. Although building can be difficult with fewer players, the board is so open that there is hardly any tension in the two-player game; this means that fulfilling the food/piety requirements every turn is very easy in the 2-p. game, and there is very little competition over spaces on the board. So, I'm torn. It's not the best game in the world, but it has a lot of good qualities.

This may look like a hardcore eurogame, but its appearance hides the truth... World Without End is tactical, chaotic, and thematic.

Funny, this is another game that I rather like but has not gone over very well with the people I game with. I like the blend of planning and chaos, I think it hits a sweet spot where the chaos is dramatic and exciting but not overwhelming, and the planning is not to complicated that the chaos feels out of disproportionate. I like that it's a resource accumulation game with so much drag that you can't just ride a strong start. And I like how all these things meld with the theme. It's not a top-shelf game, and I don't think it's as good as Pillars (which I think is often underrated), but I do think it's a fine game.
---
Played twice, not sure on this one yet. I've enjoyed both plays. And I have to remember that Pillars of the Earth actually took a number of plays to grow on me; I originally thought Pillars was just OK while now I think it's an underrated classic. Anyway, World Without End is more or less totally unlike Pillars, it actually shares a feel with Year of the Dragon - you're trying to build an economy while there is constant, large drag of outside interference. It's very much an efficiency game, you've got 24 card plays over the course of the game and need to squeeze as much as you can out of them.

Nice, and pretty nicely thematic, but it seems to lack Pillars' tension - the draw-bag auction in Pillars was a great core mechanic with a lot of things going for it, an equivalent to which World Without End doesn't seem to have.

Anyway, I enjoyed it, but not sure where in the spectrum it eventually end up.

Pretty cool sequel to Pillars of the Earth, although the games really aren't all that similar.  I really enjoyed the "chapters" to this game, giving players various events to wrestle with, although a few of the events are actually helpful.  I really enjoy games like this that hammer the players a bit and make them struggle.

Other than the events, it's a fairly typical game of action selection, but it's challenging enough compared to similar games to make it very enjoyable. It's fun trying to do better than your opponents using the exact same deck of available actions.  Good stuff!

A beautifully, haunting, poetic trek. People say, Year of the Dragon is punishing...better think again. WWE is a tough play in the sense the theme is profound, the choices tough and your fate can be bleak. There is a unique push pull here. Most Euros propel you forward with victory points and sometimes pull you back some with minor punishments. That is not the case here and therefore plays really strong to the games theme. Remember, your dealing with a time period close to 700 years ago. Things were not easy. The game plays over four chapters, each chapter consisting of 6 rounds. So essentially 24 games turns per player. At the end of each Chapter there are dues 2 piety, 2 food, ?$ taxes to the crown, depending on a dice roll of 2-3-4-4-5. Couple this with 24 events and you have a game that is pulling you back more then propelling you forward. This was Ok by me and the game really began to open up and flourish going into Chapter 3. I was very curious about being able to build, earn money and help the sick. All of this while a certain foreboding of a bad event (or could it be good) just seemed to loom over the game. Toward the end there was no clear winner thanks to the hidden knowledge behind each player screen. Yes, the tension was very high indeed. Ultimately the game felt like a special experience. I constantly found myself questioning my decisions regarding the path I would pursue moving forward. Well done, a real gem worthy of it place in an epic series and definitly underrated in my opinion. The more I play this the more I  prefer it over Pillars of the Earth and thats saying a lot.

No - it does not share the mechanics of Pillars of the Earth! Yes, the boards are illustrated by the same artist, and yes, the theme is set in the medieval times and yes, it's about collecting cubes... But the same can be said about lots of other euros, and I think these games are quite different. 

I like WWE better than PotE due to various reasons, but mainly because of the awesome mechanic of the event cards where you need to take into consideration how you rotate them. There is perhaps a bit less luck in this game (no blind draws from a bag), but on the other hand the event cards are wildly different and might mess up your plans! So, PotE is more strategic than WWE, which is more tactic in my opinion.

I also like how you have the same 12 actions at your disposal each round but can only choose 6 of those - even though you really want to do a lot more! Furthermore, there are multiple paths to victory and to me, those are thes sign of a good euro game! Additionally, I really dig the penalty phase and you always feel you can just barely survive.

WWE only supports 4, so if you are 5 or 6, definitely check out PotE + expansion; it's not that PotE is a bad game, I just slightly prefer this one, and unlike many others, I think it's actually pretty good with 3 players though 4 is still best.

Yet another blandly themed Medieval building game involving the collection of stone, wood, grain, taxes and the 'favour of the king'. Sounds incredibly dull but surprisingly it's not! Lots of hard choices and some novel mechanics such as choosing one card to play and one card to discard each turn and the rotatable event card make this a bit different and fun.

un juego que dentro de su peso medio-ligero es una excelente elección, solo por sus ingeniosas mecánicas y lo novedoso de su mecanismo de colocación de eventos merece la pena. Ya he comentado que su parecido estético con el pilares puede desanimar alguna compra, pero que esto no os engañe es un gran juego, para mi bastante mejor que el pilares ( que no me gusto mucho, todo sea dicho). Vuelvo a incidir sobre el tema de su duración que es perfecta y la verdad es que te deja con ganas de volver a repetirlo, si no en esa sesión en otra, y para mi eso es síntoma de que el juego va a ver mesa más que la media de nuestros juegos. Ha entrado con gran fuerza en mi TOP TEN (estoy de suerte porque ultimamente han entrado bastantes nuevos juegos en el mismo). En fin una compra segura.

I like the mechanic where you have 12 possible actions (Cards), but through a round you can only play 6. Each time you play one card, you have to discard another. Also each round when you start, you can choose who gets what benefit.

RATING: 7
Since this game will be compared to Pillars of the Earth, one can confidently claim they are nothing alike.  Instead of a worker placement game to gather your resources, you play 1 of your 12 action cards that are from your own deck.  The distribution of resources by the starting player is interesting though seen before.

There seems to be a little too much emphasis on gathering the resources that you are "taxed" at the end of 6 rounds (a chapter) so your moves can be somehwat scripted, especially in the firast couple of rounds. Once you protect yourself from losing VPs, then you can focus on the game itself and try to pull ahead.

The game is interesting and an improvement over PotE.  While Christie thinks it is the best new game in a long while, I still am somewhat lukewarm on it.  Luckily it plays rather quickly - about 20 minutes per player once you get the mechanics down.  So with each play I it has grown on me a little bit more.

This attractive game is driven through event cards and action selection.  The event cards are randomly ordered with a different set for each of the four chapters.  Positioning the card is key as each player gets the benefit on the corner of the even card pointing toward them.  This also determines movement of the favor, which provides the active player a possible benefit.  The events themselves affect all players and can be good or bad.  Action selection cards are used once only per chapter.  I like that a variety of strategies seems possible.

Way better than I expected. I really didn't like Pillars, mainly due to the random element, which I don't even remember clearly anymore. Everything in this flowed really nicely, with a nice balance of getting whacked for not meeting goals (like a Stefan Feld game or something), but also rewards for building stuff. I had heard that the game dragged, but it didn't feel that way to me. And I didn't even win. I might have to pick this up.

First impression: Quite not a sequel to Pillars of the Earth, a good and interesting game for FOUR. Won't like to try it with two or even three, because the main mechanism really works only with four people playing! Good enough to hunt it down for my collection.

RATING: 5
I have never played Brug naar de Hemel's predecessor (De Kathedraal) and so cannot comment on the game's similarities and differences. I have, however, played other 'full board' games by authors Rieneck and Stadler, notably Cuba and its expansion, and found it fun to point out parallels and differences. The games share a similar iconography, for example; in addition both appear to be very tactical in nature. Brug naar de Hemel is about gathering resources to spend on buildings, but also on various taxes lest you run into problems with clergy, law or middle class. Driving this game is an 'event deck' of cards which can help or hinder you; you get resources either from that event in a way which reminds me of League of Six: rotate the event card in a certain fashion and whatever points to you is what you get for that turn. After gathering resources you are required to play one action card while discarding another, thus forcing you to make some choices about how you are going to play the current 'chapter' of event cards. 

The game isn't as silly as I envisaged it would be and features plenty of opportunities to explore. In that aspect it is a good game. What I don't really like is the capriciousness of the event cards. Now this makes perfect thematic sense as life in the 14th century was rather brutal (and quite often very short). It also explains why the game isn't really about creating a flawless engine from the start, but is about trying to survive nasty events until you've gathered sufficient resources to keep your head above water. I can certainly appreciate this technical point of view, but that is not the same as liking it from a gaming point of view. I'm not one for a game which intentionally keeps players down, and this games takes that particular dislike close to my breaking point. Brug naar de Hemel is not a bad game by any measure, it's just not my cup of tea.

Although it has little in common with its predecessor other than literary origins, World Without End is clearly the superior game.

Besides the variety of board options, what makes this game unique is the event card orientation, which affects all players, but unevenly.  Also players must decide both a card to play and a card to discard every round making planning ahead a real challenge.

The slight downside is that very little is a mystery when it comes to scoring, so players that fall behind can feel like they are always trying to catch up.

But on the whole - a solid game that plays much faster than the box would indicate.  Looking forward to more players for our next play.

Finally got to play this 4 player at BGG.Con.
Very nice game. You have to feed your people and pay taxes, etc after each chapter, but it's not as much of a struggle as a lot of games. 
Each turn you pull a crisis card which typically hurts everybody. The crisis cards make it feel like a Co-Op game, but there's no Co-operation at all.

This one has a great looking board with plenty of information printed around the graphics.  I like that it is nothing like Pillars of the Earth when it comes to game play.  But...be prepared.  This game is on the offensive against the players.  There are many things to throw a wrench in your strategy turn by turn.  It took me a bit to get used to it, but I didn't mind it in the end.  I like that the game is the one assaulting the players.  Since it's not players assaulting each other...it's kind of like getting confrontational mechanics without the direct confrontation.  So you have to roll and adapt with game events without blaming other players for your troubles.  In the end I like Pillars of the Earth much more, but this is a good addition to the collection.  I can't think of another game quite like it.

2-4 jugadors (60-90 minuts)
Teòricament és de colocació de treballadors, però a la pràctica no és tant així.
POSITIU: Un Mundo Sin Fin es un juego que escala perfecto según el número de jugadores, es rápido sin apenas tiempos muertos, es intuitivo y atractivo para no jugones, pero profundo en su estrategia. Con los eventos, cada partida es diferente y es muy táctico, porque continuamente tienes que adaptarte a los eventos y a las decisiones de los otros jugadores. Por supuesto, esa sensación de agobio con los recursos a entregar al final de cada capítulo está muy conseguida, sobre todo a 4 jugadores
NEGATIU: A dos diuen que és massa fàcil (no s'esgoten els recursos, però amb 3 o 4 jugadors ja sí).
Una de les queixes del joc, és que a cada torn has de pagar uns impostos, i pràcticament no fas més en tota la partida que aconseguir això, i intentar esgarrapar punts d'altres costats (al Villa i StoneAge pots centrar-te absolutament en altres vies per la victòria).

Played Pillars and World Without End once now. I have to say I kind of like WWE more due to the fact that everything in this game is tight/scarce. Also, the deduct VPs for penalty in this game is deadly. 

Every player has the same exact deck of action cards and each player play one from their hand. This allow us to see who can play and manage well in their game since everything is fair and square (all players have exact same deck).

This game gives a punch during the mandatory duties. There's nothing that can save you if you cannot fulfill the duties. Although paying with loyal token will stop you from receiving the penalty action, your VPs will still be deducted!

I'm not saying I hate Pillars, I still like it, really. 

Wonder why this one has no expansion.

Possibly one of the best games of all-time.   It is tight, atmospheric, beautiful, and brilliant.  Oh yes, and non-gamers 'get it'.

 Even if you haven't read the book the narrative is atmospheric, and the feeling of just about getting through in a tough medieval world is rendered so well. The event cards can make life tough and undermine strategies but that is what makes the game so great, and that is what leaves the game open for amazing come-backs and nail-biting finishes. The reason that it suffers from a relatively low rating is twofold: (1) some people simply do not like games where events come in and change the dynamics of the game, thus undermining their perfectly formulated plans. But this is the beauty of this game as you have to be prepared for game-changing situations. Some games can be played with ease and a straightforward strategy as benign events happen, but others are hit by tough events and devastating consequences (true to the time in which the game is set) which really keep you on you toes, but allow new strategies and tactics to be deployed. (2) some people just don't like games which throw bad things at you for you to deal with. 

Their loss though as this game is world-class.

Have you ever wondered what it's like to be incredibly religious and have your chosen deity never answer one effin' prayer you've ever had?  And then do you wonder why would anyone ever maintain their faith in such a case?  World Without End answers this question very simply - victory points.

That being said, this is a fantastic game that does not require or preach any sort of religious doctrine, but a big-ass church is central to the game, so if that bothers you, move along.

Still here?  Good.

What you have here is a game that features solid mechanisms (mechanics?) - its play one/discard one action-selection is a beaut, and coupled with the initial "story cards" and how they are oriented on the board, the choices available are rife with strategic options as well as tactical ones.  Even though down-time can be a bit of an issue with certain types of players, most of that time is spent figuring out exactly what you're going to do and more importantly, what you're [i]not[/i] going to do.  That's pretty phenomenal.  Ultimately, you need to balance what you [i]need[/i] to do (this is a game of perpetual firefighting) and what you [i]want[/i] to do.  Thing is, a lot of the things you [i]need[/i] to do don't get you any closer to victory; they just keep you in the game.  Again, phenomenal.

Clock that in with a relatively short run-time and you've got one of the better games out there ever made.  Play this one!

A beautiful game where the players tell a story in four chapters. I found it a bit fiddly the first time due to the huge amount of cubes and chits, but its manageable. Its distinct enough from other Eurogames of that category to be interesting, especially the chaotic aspect of the interfering events and the desperate need for planing ahead. The decisions that you have to make are hard, the penalties are tough, and the timing is difficult - all in all a very atmospheric and demanding game with unique and clever mechanics that work very well altogether.

A great worker placement game without worker placement. I don't know why this game doesn't get more attention, it has some innovative mechanisms, looks gorgeous and plays silky smooth.

 The penalties for not being able to pay at the end of each chapter might be a bit too punishing. But other than that I can't find any flaws.

RATING: 7
An appropriate sequel to Pillars of the Earth; a little something to think about without too much control, so that it will appeal to the family market.

The elegant mechanism for choosing income versus privilege through positioning the event card is appealing; however, the choices are rarely interesting.

The only real challenge is deciding which action to take, and that is usually decided for you. So this is not exactly challenging at all, but with all the usual mechanical suspects here, this makes for good gateway material.

This is one of the best looking boardgames I own.  the Artwork is fantastic and I love the detail of the wooden wheat resources.

It's a VP based game where obtaining points is relatively difficult as most of the game time is spent collecting wheat, money and piety just to survive.

Gameplay works by a novel mechanism of the orientation of the current round card, played by the current start player, where all players collect a reward such as a resource  (Wheat, Piety, Wood, Stone, Knowledge, Kings favour and Money).  This is then followed by action card play similar to that in "A Castle for All Seasons"

Hangulatos classic resource management euro, egy-két meglepően egyedi megoldással. Nagyon jó ötlet benne az eseménykártya forgatgatás, ahol mindig valami nehéz döntést kell meghozni, mert egyszerre mindenhol nem nagyon járhatunk jól vele. Maguk az események is nagyon hangulatosak, jó hogy ilyen sok van belőle, így mindig más és más lehet a játék. Viszont ugyanitt van talán a legnagyobb probléma is, mert az eseményekkel azért elég nagy szerencsefaktor is bejön, ami kicsit meglepő egy amúgy kockamenedzselős eurótól. 
Cserébe a grafika gyönyörű és nagyon jól működik két játékossal is.

RATING: 6
Parallels to Pillars of the Earth are pretty obvious graphically, thematically, and with regards to the gameplay. It is, however, not simply a rehashing of ideas from the predecessor. For example, there is no more worker placement. Instead, each player has an identical set of action cards of which he chooses one each turn. That gets rid of the luck of the draw that some complained about in PotE. An amount of luck that feels similar to that is introduced by the event cards, though, which in addition to the event itself also decide about the players' income. The active player can decide who gets what to some extent, but often at the expense of making his own turn less useful.

The game captures the theme very well. In PotE the main endeavour was to get victory points. At a guess, I'd say in WWE you spend somewhere between 60 and 90% of your energy on collecting enough resources to be able to pay your dues at the end of each period (taxes, food, and faith). Generating VPs has become an afterthought, something to do in your free time.

As a result, WWE feels extremely tight. Finding the right balance between dues and VPs is not an easy task.

World Without End is pretty good! It has some elements I haven't seen in any other games. The 'event card/starting income/queen's track' mechanic is what makes the game, and it's a super-tight resource management game otherwise with a tough decision action phase as well. Punishing and mean at points, but in this type of game I actually find that part of the appeal. Tired of the theme and something tells me that I might get tired of this game with too many plays, but it's pretty cool for what it is.

Personal: I find it a great light game with quite simple rules. Just take the card and play one action card, the system of the event cards is awesome (an event for the run or chapter, some resources for all players and one privilege for the active player), the idea of having to choose which actions you are not going to use for that chapter is also great (play an action card, discard an action card). The grain, piety and gold you have to pay at the end of each chapter let you with an agony I like in these games, you find yourself fighting internally if you go for the payments or go for the victory

RATING: 6
One play with four and a half a play with three. I'm on the fence with this one; there are plenty of interesting short-term decisions, and to some extent it looks like there might be a diversity of different viable long-term strategies as well. However, I definitely felt put off by the clutter of the game. Detail can be justified by having it linked to a theme, and the game certainly [i]looks[/i] like it ought to be thematic, but there's a lot of abstraction that undercuts this. What does it mean to randomly get an income of "piety" or victory points? Why would building housing on a leper island get me stone? Why does curing the plague get me cloth? So, in the end it feels like there's just a bunch of different abstract stuff going on and you pick something and go with it.

The upshot is that it's a game that I'm sure I'll enjoy well enough while the rules are still fresh in my mind, but if I ever lose the thread of what it's all about I probably won't be that interested in going back to it.

There are 10 wheat in this game, for two player it's plenty for three players it's OK but for four players it's much too scarce and hoarders may screw others. Investion in medical knowledge does not pay out. Favour track for this should be "?" Instead of only fixed "2".

While I’ve never read Ken Follett’s books, I have become quite a fan of the games.  I thoroughly enjoy Pillars of the Earth, but generally approach sequels -- be they movies or games -- with some trepidation.  I heard early complaints that the game was brutal, with some harsh events that could really stagger the players.  I also heard complaints about the game’s length.  So, I entered my first game with apprehension.  Fortunately, the apprehension dissipated quickly as I thoroughly enjoyed the game.  I found the decisions to be tough and the game quite competitive and tense.  The events certainly could sidetrack one’s plans, but they never devastated anyone.  Further, the game played to conclusion in about two hours, which is perfectly acceptable to me for a game with this degree of depth and strategy.

All subsequent playing have reinforced my initial opinion.  World Without End is a tight, tense and challenging game that forces players to balance numerous factors and adapt to unexpected situations caused by events and the actions of one’s opponents.  The card play mechanism of having to discard an action card each time you play one causes quite a bit of angst, and requires advance planning that may ultimately be blindsided by an unexpected event or occurrence.  It seems that you always wish you had one or two of those discarded cards back in your hand.  Such tension and angst generally makes for a good gaming experience, and these elements permeate World Without End.  This is one sequel that actually has me looking forward to the next installment in the saga!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
One of those games where you play not only against other players, but also against the game system, which punishes them for not having enough food, money or piety at determined points. Every turn you play one of your action cards and discard another, which forces some planning. The mechanic of choosing items for you and your opponents by the orientation of the event cards is very nice, and the events themselves help implement the theme well enough. But they are also very random and can really harm or benefit specific players, so that luck becomes too important in an otherwise fine strategic game.

I just threw it in on a order to get free shipping even though I hadn't heard anything about it.  I enjoy Pillars and figured I'd like to see what 'the sequel' most look like.

A beautiful board and nice components.  Although in our first play we did see some 'errors'.  I'm not one to really grip about it, but I guess it could be annoying to others.  To be fair, so far it was just one card that is in error.

It, however, plays very different then pillars.  Each person has a deck of cards. similar to roles to pick from, so you don't have to worry about not getting the action you want.  

You play actions to get things to help build and to give things to the king.  The game starts right off putting you under stress.  There is a reason you start the game with a score of 8.  It's because the game will punish you for not meeting certain minimums each round.

When I pulled it out, a friend was 'hey, I don't want something 'replacing' my pillars.  I said, 'don't worry, this isn't a worked placement'.  I noticed he made a comment elsewhere on the Geek, that it is different.  'But, one is better, this one'.  The Game left me wanting more.

Almost worth its playing time, which is rather a back-handed compliment for games of this weight but a compliment nonetheless. Nothing terribly interesting--you tread water in terms of upkeep while scratching away a few points here and there.
That said, though, the random events are a bit ridiculous. There is a small number of ways to earn points, and events can nuke them almost entirely. Seriously. Say you get your points from buildings--some card can show up and say, "nope, not any more." I appreciate random events in such games, but not when they affect core point-generation to that extent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A solid game and for me, a HUGE step foward from the boring "Pillars".

This is a tense game with a few random elements which are not game breaking, but that can make the game more easy for you. Don't let it fool you, everything is scarce in this game and it's more about staying alive than building something up.

Best with 2 players for me, since you have much more control, while more players increase the luck factor by a good amount.

ok game.  Thinking about it, it seems a little flat.  I am not sure how to explain it.

Tips: Pay your taxes!  Get a surplus of piety, wheat, and money if it comes easy so that you don't have to worry about it the following year and save a turn.

Building is Key.  I got the resources and I did building twice for 12 points.  I did this for 2 turns.

a little less luck bound then Pillars of the earth. Have to play this a couple of times more to see if it's better. Maybe by then I'll finish the book as well.

UPDATE: When playing the 4 player game this becomes a very close and tense game, where the winner is often decided in the last round. Managing resources is key of course in these kind of games, but the system implemented in this game, keeps you biting your nails till it's over.
Only downside, it that it's a bit fiddly, cause startplayer is moved every turn and resources shuffle around a lot, but all is manageble.

Similar in feel to "Year of the Dragon" because of the constant flow of bad things you have to ward off or prepare for, but less abstract; there is some luck but it's quite pleasant to manage.  The game is fluid, fast and beautiful.
Event variability adds to the game lifetime. I love it.

Some of my gaming partners find it a little oppressive because of the "impending doom" feel; for me it's the proof that the theme is wonderfully interwoven in this title. But because of that, this game does not see enough table time, just like "Year of the Dragon".  Eh.

Much like Year of the Dragon, it is game you win if you have the least bad things happen to you.  It has a horrible rule book and isn't perfectly balanced, but has a couple innovative mechanics that make it worth playing.  The shame is that it could have been a great game.

Okay, let's get this out of the way: I vehemently hate this game and any game like this.

Nothing annoys or enrages me more than spending several hours being subjected to seemingly random events, punitive game mechanics and oppressive, dreary theme.

There are 4 chapters, each with progressively worsening events, that supposedly follow the story line of the book of the same name. I must select six actions, out of a hand of twelve, during each of those chapters, in a desperate race to stay ahead of the plague and the greedy hand of government. I must round up 2x grain, 2x piety, and 2-5 gold before the end of each chapter, as sort of a "tribute" to my king, or I suffer the consequences. This was like A Castle for All Ages and Agricola in theme, and akin to Notre Dame in the action card mechanics.

The novel aspect of the game is the event deck, which has the random events aspect (the part I despise), and the ability for the active player to orient the current event card, in such a way as to determine what single, unique resource each player will get, as well as determining how many spaces a pawn will move forward to give the active player a bonus (or a negative). The other novel aspect is that each round a player must choose an action to play AND and action to discard from his hand. In this manner, the player is compelled to decide what actions he/she is willing to forgo during the current chapter. 

The game is extremely tight in terms of VP, so it is a search for elements that will give a player a breakout in points. The production of grain, piety, loyalty, wool, cloth, gold, wood, stone, or medical knowledge, and converting these very scarce resources into VP is the heart of the game. There is a brief period to try to set up a limited economic engine to generate these resources, but after that, the game will dish out random events that most likely hamper one's attempts, rather than aid them.

I haven't read the book, so I have not bought into the theme. However, the game's ability to make me feel the oppressive yoke of authority was ever present, so there is that. However, I have enough of that at work, and feeling that kind of frustration is not what I look for in a game. 

Yes, there are plenty of games out there that dish out random events, like Iron Dragon, Lord of the Rings, and A Game of Thrones, but the risk can be foreseen and mitigated, or avoided. In this game, it is not. For example, in my game, suddenly all players lost two actions in a row, because the event card said there was war. Another event said that the plague was suddenly stopped, punishing the player that had invested heavily in medical knowledge. Nice for theme, but terrible in terms of gaming experience. I was ready to revolt right there and then. So, I will be more weary of this kind of theme in the future.

Okay, I know this is a little flavor of the month right now, but I really enjoyed this game (and found it very different from Pillars of the Earth, to which it is technically a sequel).  At the beginning of every turn, there is a diamond which the active player can rotate to point in any direction, and this determines which resource each player will start with. I think this is very clever, as is the track associated with it, where the active player can pick up one extra little goody (or penalty). The game also uses events to make sure that the game ramps up over time.  

Other than that, the game is all about managing and preventing disasters while also trying to build things up well enough to get points--a genre that I've always enjoyed.  It also fixes the problem that Pillars had, where the relationship of resources to points was too direct; there is much more going on here and it is far more interesting as a result. (1 play)

4p game has a little too much denial aspects on weed and on buildings (if there are only a few out)...

If you are only some better than others you might still lose this game (I won despite not being some better than others, maybe a little worse, maybe on par, who knows - e.g. I did some mistakes and still won... due to:)

luck... is what drives much of this game. This would not be any issue if there wasnt an issue with the game's ...

length, is what makes this game "unshine". It just takes too long. Overall it has some neat mechanics with the hand management and also the decision making but it is also prone to analysis paralysis mostly during the first turns of each phase and most importantly during the first turn in phase 1 and maybe 2.

The components are great - the theme "would" carry if you were not constantly struggeling. We also felt that medicine knowledge was a little on the weak side for that the discovery of pest houses was not only random but also slow and prone to player order issues.

So overall... too long for that it should be played with 4 and heavily relys on luck as well. Similar to egizia despite a different game - much better than village but still not too good.

World Without End has a fairly strong theme that is integrated quite well with the game mechanics. There are some interesting rules, the players are faced with decisions throughout much of the game, and the length seems about right. The event cards can have a significant effect on the result of a game, but this can be mitigated by good play and the flip side to the randomness is, of course, variability between games. Several years after first playing the game, I enjoy it more than ever!

Sort of a more forgiving version of a Stefan Feld game.  Yes, you will fight the game a bit as in In the Year of the Dragon, but you can fight and win.  More like Agricola's food requirement in that sense.  Seemingly multiple strategies to be employed.  It disappoints a little in length.  A tighter experience might see this game at an 8.  There is also a reasonable amount of luck that can stymie planning, so not for those who don't enjoy a bit of a roller-coaster ride.

Yet somehow it's not annoying/painful.  I can play it occasionally (still, the question 'what for?' hangs in the air...).

['Pillars of the Earth' is much more refined and natural design]

"Brug naar de hemel". Gekregen van mama en vake op kerstavond 2013. Spel met een paar originele vondsten, zoals gebeurteniskaartjes die je moet draaien waardoor iedereen iets krijgt, of bouwprojecten die op het spelbord gelegd worden en waaraan meegebouwd kan worden. Het spel bestaat uit vier hoofdstukken (elk met zes gebeurteniskaartjes die ronde na ronde worden omgedraaid); elke ronde speelt iedereen ook een gebeurteniskaartje en legt er een ander weg. Na elk hoofdstuk moet (veel) betaald worden (2 vroomheden, 2 graan, en evenveel geld als je dobbelt). Lukt betalen niet, worden punten afgetrokken en krijg je straf. Leuk spel, maar het eindigt wat plots, in het ijle.

Played surprisingly fast, at least with 3 players, even though only 1 of the players had played before.  The fact that only roughly half the event cards come into play in a game it looks like it should have some replayability.

It looks nice, there are clever ideas in the rules, and it is very thematic. It was good to play it once but I do not feel the urge to play it again. Maybe if I was a fan of the books.

RATING: 7
An interesting hand and resource management Euro game based on Ken Follet's novel of the same name.  I have heard complaints that it is too hard on the player, that they constantly feel like they're behind, trying to meet quotas rather than "playing."  I would argue that this perfectly fits the book's Medieval theme.  In the Dark Ages there was plague, people were subject to the church, there were taxes to the king even if you had nothing to give, and food was not easy to come by (at least we're led to believe), all of which matches the game's play.  With the scenarios randomized, the players never know whether there will be a drought or disease, or the king bestows a boon on the players (sometimes it happens).  But perhaps the most unique part of the game is the compass point orientation of scenario cards that forces the players to decide between what they need versus what they know their opponents need. All in all an interesting game that flies under most people's radar - or at least in the shadow of its older brother, Pillars of the Earth.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2010)

I have only played it once, and to be perfectly honest, I don’t remember much about the game. It was played on 2010, the year I really got onto the hobby. I remember I didn’t like the game much, at the time I loved The Pillars of the Earth. I´m rating it according to my desire to play it again, however I still want to give it a fair chance.

As soon as I play it again, I will come back and re comment. 

Current Rating : 6.0

RATING: 9
A game full of interesting choices and most of the time these choices are real.  There often is not just one really obvious answer that you will always take.  The game rewards strategic thinking while forcing you at times to take a break from your strategy and play tactically - either to meet an end of chapter requirement or deal with an event card.

I like it better than Pillars of the Earth. Worker placement game that uses cards rather than workers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
Currently my favorite worker placement game.

This game gave me a similar feeling that I had in Hansa Teutonica in that there are many different options, many different potential winning strategies, yet you don't have quite enough actions in a turn. There's a painful (in a good way) "ditch 1 action card every turn" rule that was the hardest part of the game for me. (I'm the kind of player that will never discard a card in Blue Moon City b/c it might come in useful later). I also liked the event "compass" mechanism that is also tied to a separate "favor track" rondel. This session was particularly fun b/c no one had ever played, and no one knew anything about the possible event cards, so there was a great feeling of unpredictability and adventure. That combined with the level of thematic details that are nicely integrated into the mechanisms, and the multitude of strategic options, all result in this game being one of the best I played this month.

I was happy to see this get the 2010 Spiel Des Jahres Plus for "advanced boardgame"!

So many actions are spent gathering the necessary grain, penitance, and coins each round that it seems like there are only a couple of actions left for doing other things. Then most of the goods you receive are selected by other players. There are also some cards that come out and add chaos by adding various types of damage. I didn't like the chaos on my first two plays. Finally on my third play I was able to accept the chaos. It is possible to adjust to it, but you are always living on the edge. I am starting to really like this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've only played this with 2-players, but somehow I suspect this is a better 2-player than 3 or 4. I really like the mechanics with the card orientation. The game is very much about damage control,but that´s not a biggie for me, although I think that both me and my wife are risk adverse and normally much more aggressive in two-player games without so much "damage control mechanics"

The gameboard is beautiful, and the stuff with evolving  theme is great.
I found that the rules are not so well written and  pretty fiddley the first play. But after that the game is pretty simple.
This game offers some quite difficult decisions, and is thus challenging for the *AP-prone. It's OK for me and my wife, but a can tell You, this is not a game I would´t like to play with some guys in our regular group.

Comparing this to Pillars of the Earth is obvious and justified. In its core it's a game of turn optimization and card management. No worker placement here and not as strong an engine building element as in PoE. Most notably this has more (potentially too much) luck than its elder brother. To win, you nonetheless need a plan for building up your position while optimizing VP's each move and generating the resources required each chapter. Without good balancing, no luck can help you but bad luck can thwart the best plan. The game has a nice narrative. At least you could enjoy the experience of getting nowhere in some rounds. The 24 game rounds might get repetitive with more play but I'm not nearly as afraid of that as for example with Colonia. All in all, players enjoying PoE for the atmosphere should enjoy this as well.

RATING: 8.1
Thematically being as great or even greather than its predecessor Pillars Of Earth this game has a completely different mechanic therefore is no expansion but a completely new game. Plays very different and is overall not as approachable for non gamers like pillars of earth was. And while it's a more complex game with more puzzles to solve and harder penalties it feels like being more random than it's predecessor due to the event cards. However I would still look at it like a gamers game compared to pillars of earth as a gateway game. Both are great and  each one suits a different taste.

RATING: 6
Not having read the series that the game is based on, it's hard to care much about the theme or backstory. The game wasn't as tense or challenging as I had anticipated, and in general is not compelling or unique enough to warrant much play. It doesn't help that Mayfair's pricing policy makes it more expensive than other comparable games. I also dislike the artwork, which is functional but not interesting.

The inferior little brother to Pillars of the Earth.  The decisions in this game are ho-hum.  Everything will benefit you and there are enough good cards that discarding some of them doesn't feel like you are really making important and tense decisions.  This tried to take worker placement and role selection and combine them and I think it fails.  There is a single strategy (go for stone/wood, build often, and get crowns to protect you during the end round) that has worked for me time after time.  Not a good game, not a bad game either.  I find it boring though.

For those wanting a sequel to pillars of the earth, this game resembles it in only two ways; the artwork and the fact that it is a euro, however it is an extremely solid game on it's own. There seems to be a little Feldishness to it, in that there are about a dozen ways on any given turn to score points, and several paths to victory. Overall a fun game, but with only superficial resemblance to pillars.

Nagyon hangulatos játék! Megkockáztatom, hogy talán még szebb, mint az elődje, a Pillars of the Earth. Alapvetően nem túl bonyolult a szabályrendszer, tulajdonképpen körönként egyetlen akciót kell végrehajtani, de azért eléggé meg kell tervezni a lépéseket, mert a fordulók végi beadandók nem teljesítése komoly büntetést von maga után. Az eseménykártyák, és azok felhasználása (bevétel meghatározása minden játékos számára) nagyon egyedi, szerintem kimondottan érdemes a hangulati szövegeket is felolvasni, kicsit átgondolni. Nem az a társas (a Pillars of the Earth sem), amit nagyon gyakran elővennék, de kiváló játék, kisebb szünetek után, biztosan előkerül időről időre.

Took 4 years to get to the table.

Love this game, since you can't juggle all the aspects of the game every play you have to focus on one or two things.  If some other player focusses on the same thing you can either start racing him to be the best or switch to another strategy. 

I might have scored it to low but once again this game really depends on the fellow players.

A decent (but inferior imho) follow up to Pillars of the Earth.  Gets rid of the artisan mechanic (which was great) in favor of a more "reactive" gameplay.  Less planning, less strategy, more tactics and more effects on other players (although still not very adversarial).  You basically select the punctually best action every turn and the rest of the game plays itself.  It's decent, but I expected more from the successor to Pillars.

RATING: 5
Lavishly produced, the game play was interesting but felt a bit too out of control at times.  I both liked and hated the function of the chapter cards which gave different items to players - but I seemed to frequently get stuck with 1 point corner which hurt my resource gathering efforts tremendously.  Penalties for not meeting tribute requirements are extremely painful and you can easily lose out through no fault of your own.  This is one of those games I'll be fine with playing if people desire, but not one I desire to own or will ask to play.

Great little "I want to do everything" game with a number of cracking mechanics.  Variable role selection is common across games, but having to discard half your actions every "chapter" (phase) adds another level.

Some interesting mechanics: reward selection from square cards, play one action card and discard one... I hated the random events, which can screw up any kind of planning.

In many ways a reverse version of Pillars of the Earth; instead of worker placement to activate abilities and cards you use a hand of cards to gain tokens, resources, and points.

This game has a tight design and some clever elements. The upkeep at th end of each era is a source of major tension. I also like the sheer variety of ways to achieve vp's. 

Finally, though it's a totally randomizing element, the events keep things constantly changing, evolving, and keep you off step.

I'm not sure I could ever play Pillars again.

A dull and overlong book serves as the stepping stone for a brisk and enjoyable game. The individual gamelets (like the balancing act of the event card orientation or the action card selection with the twin decision of what you’re doing and what you forfeit for the rest of the round) work as well as they did in Cuba or Die Säulen der Erde, but they form a more coherent overall game.

The event cards will make for a lot of "if only I’d known..." moments in your first few games, but since not all of them will come up in a given game, this is not as obnoxious a benefit for experienced players over newcomers as the craftsmen in Die Säulen der Erde. Overall, a game I’d gladly play a couple more times, even though it brings back memories of the book itself.

Excellent game! I was surprised by how much I liked this one. I didn't expect it to measure up to Pillars of the Earth, being that Pillars is so well liked and considered a classic worker placement game. But, after one play, I liked WWE more. Granted, I was playing with 2, and with more players Pillars might shine. But in both games, I can see 4 being the sweet spot. For that reason, this gets a slightly higher rating than Pillars. It's just as beautiful, the components are just as nice (minus the cool turn marker), and the play time is similar (about 90 minutes with 2), but this one is just more tightly balanced.

Even better than "the pillars of the earth" by the same authors. Frequently played in our group when we are only four (alternatives are Amyitis, Troyes and Stoneage). Very interesting mechanics which interweave seamlessly. Admittedly, luck does play a certain part, but with this game nobody minds.

How to deal with chaos ? At each turn, a random event stress the players, wich compete to have the most influence on the city. In addition, four times in the game, players will have to pay some ressources (faith, money, bred) in order to keep their victory points. The competition is then against other players, but also against the game itself. I love it, very good.

World Without End? Game without end, more like...
...except, it did end, and rather suddenly at that.

I'm interested that I've heard opinion from my game group about Euro games which are "simply pushing cubes around". Examples of these have been Le Havre, Puerto Rico and El Grande. I love all these games. To me, they are thematic and the actions are relevant to what you're trying to achieve. THIS game is the second I've played (Hermagor being the other) that truly does feel like pushing bits around a board. For me, it has no theme. The artwork is as lovely as Pillars of the Earth, but I'm struggling to find the game here. After an hour I found myself looking at my watch, which isn't something I do at game night.

Others in my group love it, even the cube-pushing haters. I'll give it another go to see if it makes sense to me next time, but I'm glad I didn't stump up the cash for this one, which I so nearly did.

[Update:] I've now played this a second time and hated it so much I've dropped my rating from a 5 to a 3. This is a turgid, funless gaming experience in which the - admittedly novel - turn event positioning mechanism proved infuriating. There are other games I dislike, but this is the first I can think of that I actively loathed for its entire duration.

Solid hand management/worker placement that is in the same thematic world as Pillars of the Earth, but stands well enough on its own.  Events keep things very interesting and make your life more miserable than it is, as you need to keep favor with the Church, King and feed your people while at the same time navigating the rough times of the Middle Ages.

There's definitely more to think about with this one compared to Pillars of the Earth, and certainly once fixed limits are placed on resources a great deal more player involvement/interaction too.

While it appears similar to Pillars of the Earth, a favorite of mine, it is completely different in playstyle.  Lots going on to track and be aware of. The event cards and what goods you are given by other players is out of your control, but you take what you can and adjust your tactics otherwise.  Great artwork and one my wife enjoys.  A bit harder to teach with some random rules that only kick in occasionally.  Some don't like the constant "feeding of your people"/upkeep costs each round.

The sequel to Pillars of the Earth. Artwork and design by the same people who did PotE. This game reminds me quite a bit of a Castle For All Seasons regarding the resource gathering. building projects, and base action cards. The other mechanics, the placing of the event card, scoring and plague, make this a bit more fun.

Looks like a nice game with many different mechanisms for scoring.

Has a nice, novel card turning mechanism where how you turn the card gives people bonus resources. Basically it is resource management with a lot of stuff going on.

RATING: 7
A "sequel" to Pillars of the Earth, thematically anyway. Unlike Pillars, the game is more simultaneous action selection based than worker placement. It also involves a much stronger story element and each round has upkeep requirements with relatively severe penalties if you fail to meet them (similar to the feeding phase in Agricola). I think the strategy of Pillars is more "hardcore" than this one.

In medieval England,each round, the active player orients a chapter card to distribute goods to all other players, and to move along a favor track to earn more goods. Players then play an action card to build, get wheat, heal the sick and so forth. Each round, they will be choosing 6 action cards, and the game lasts 4 rounds. 

If you do not have enought wheat, piety or gold, you will suffer penalties. 

Each game is different, since a number of chapter cards are removed from the game.

It's a simple and neat mechanic to distribute goods. I like the game, and look forward to more plays. I've played once with 4 players.

Suffering without end.... Oh man, did I wish the game would just end quickly.
Fell completely flat. Maybe I was tired or whatever but just hated it. 
Instead of building something I got the feeling that everything we did was just to survive all the bad stuff (piety and all that).
It was just one play (so I'm aware I should give it a 2nd chance) but I WILL NOT unless no other interesting game is available to play at game night.

Interesting resource distribution/roundel system using square cards. Unfortunately, it doesn't contribute much to the game itself. Tight resource management makes us to think there is something like a game but it is not. Mediocre at best.

Felt like a Game without End... well fortunately it ended.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Clever design (I like the action choosing mechanism) but the events can be very frustrating (not in a "good" way). I don't see diffrent strategies or a game arc - you should have a bit of everything to survive bad events and there is no feeling of a progess or control. If houses you already took care of show up again focusing on medicine can be very frustrating too. Considering all the things going on and the little control you have I think the game is too long.
A lot of people like the medieval atmosphere and describe the game as very thematic. I didn't read the book as I didn't like PotE (the book) and I usualy don't care about theme when I don't like the luck/playtime ratio or there are other issues. "In the year of the Dragon" has a similar "struggle against bad events"-feeling but I like it much better (more control/building an engine/diffrent strategies).
So if you want atmosphere and like games with a strong thematic feel you should take a closer look at "World Without End". If that's not so important to you the luck/playtime ratio might turn you off.

Very fun, contained game with a significant randomness element. I had no business winning my one play so far (by a point), except a streak of luck in the sequence of cards that came up buoyed my game at the expense of my opponents'. So perhaps this commentary comes from the delight of playing without much purpose or vision and still winning mostly thanks to dumb luck (as was the case in my one and only play of Twilight Imperium 3). But I love the medieval theme, the reward mechanic, the card selection mechanic; it really seems like this one's right up my alley.

Resources falling from the sky once again but this time the distribution mechanism is rather clever. There are a whopping nine different types of resources but since there are only a few interconnections, it's pretty easy to figure out where and when each type of resource is needed. There's only a very minimal amount of engine building, so the game is quite repetitive and somewhat longish.

ok game, but with a negative vibe. 75% of your actions is just to collect the resources that you need for the end of the period. The remaining actions can be used to do some actions that will give you points in the end. Not sure how much planning it possible, versus just grabbing what is left.

RATING: 9
Another great installment from this series; a unique and beautiful worker placement/resource management game with an interesting twist at the center! The event card drawn at the beginning of every round has four different resources and, depending on where the card is placed on the board, those four resources are "given" to the four players seated around the game board. In comparison with other worker placement games, World Without End can be difficult (there are huge penalties for not meeting the round's requirements for certain resources) but more thematic (this is not a tacked-on medieval theme). And in comparison with its sister game of Pillars of the Earth, some would prefer this game because AP occurs simultaneously to players, not one at a time. Interactive, never dull, World Without End is a fantastic worker placement game for the genre. Great fun!

RATING: 7
While it's your standard "gather resource and turn into VP's in multiple ways" type game, there's some neat mechanisms which appeal. The game is made up of 4 eras, 6 turns per era. You have 12 action cards and you must play 1 and discard 1 each turn, narrowing your options as the era progresses. The action cards either gather resource or use resource - straight up money or VP's, or invest in buildings which will earn more resource, income, VP's later, and these provide different strategic routes. There's an event card each turn which mixes things up - it also doubles as a freebie resource generator, each person getting what's on the card corner pointing at them when the card is laid on the table, active player deciding how it's laid (and the freebie may now change your action card plans). There's a requirement to discard a mix of resource each era which distracts you from investing in VP enterprises - or is it worth the penalty not to bother. Turns go pretty fast, but there's a decent decision to make each turn. While there's not a lot of tension, there's lots of ways to go about things, all the while trying to set things up to maximise the impact of your future card plays. All in all, it’s an enjoyable medium-weight Euro. There’s a fear that the power of the event cards may overwhelm the result, but I’d like to play more to find out.

RATING: 7
What I like:
- The "how you orient the card" mechanic is great (even with 2p)
- The "play one, discard one" is an interesting form of card draft
- The end-of-chapter maintenance is challenging, but good

What I don't like:
- At 90-120 minutes, it's about twice as long as I would like
- The event cards can be pretty swingy
- The seals for completed buildings seem underpowered

I think the 2.8 weight is slightly low. I would probably go 3.0. The standard 2p rules lead to a bit of blocking, but generally not a ton of interaction (which is just how I like it). The proposed variant of (greatly) reducing the available supplies of food and piety would make this into a brutal cutthroat bloodbath.

2009 has been a great year for Medium-heavy gamers. World without End is yet another great title that has been released. I really don't know what to play next. It is a great time to being able to choose from so many great games. It feels like a more luckdependant version of "In the year of the dragon" with enough differences to warrant its own edition. Again, very great looking. A valid follow-up-game for "Pillars".
Update (21.02.2011): Fun to play, but it doesn't pull me in like "Pillars" did! I lower my vote to 7.

RATING: 8
The rules make the game seem more complicated then it is. There are a lot of pieces but the main mechanic is choosing one card to plan and one to discard each turn. Your turn goes very fast and you try to maximize your score by performing one of 12 simple actions making incremental progress throughout the game. Resources are tight especially since you must pay a tax at the end of each round. Watch out for the events as they can hinder you plan so ensure you have some options. A very pleasant surprise.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At first glance, this is your typical "gather resources and turn them into VPs" game.  The real meat of the game lies in the action cards: in each turn, you pick one of your 12 actions to play, and one to discard (meaning you won't get that action until the 6-turn year is over).  This encourages planning, and each turn introduces an event which can change your plans.  Also notable is deciding how to orient the event cards, which give everyone a bonus and the active player an additional bonus.  Deciding how to orient this card can be fun, but if you're not the active player, it can feel pretty random.

Again:
Back and forth, from 8,5 to 8. And now from 8 to 7,5.

Just too many of your actions must be made to be able to pay for taxes, harvest and piety in the end of the chapters. 

I think the eventcards - and that you only use half of them - are good to keep the game varied each game. But when you play it only now and then, the randomness can irritate. Like that event when you have a opponent randomly choose a card for you to discard - if you are unlucky it could be the whole chapter (6 actions and 25% of the gametime). Sometimes it feels that the game plays for you.

Still in my shelf for now.

***  

Updated: from 8 to 8,5. Several more games, two 4-player also. Seems to have good replay value, better than Pillars. Doesn't play like Pillars at all, but it still feels like they belong to the same family. Excellent game.

***

Played two 2-player games and one 3-player game so far.

There's a nice flow in World without End - it moves along deftly and surprises you with thematic events that alter the course of the game for you and your opponents.

It is less linear than its "cousin" Pillars and presents a fun mechanic with the chapter cards. It’s one of those "go with the flow" games where you have to calculate impact on damage, reach for opportunities and have to come to terms with that your strategy must be modified due to a recent event. It’s a though life in Kingsbridge, and as a player you’ll have to both make it and survive...

It kind of reminded me of Notre Dame/Macao, but less abstracted and with a much stronger theme.

Wow, so much better than I expected!

A Euro with nasty event cards!

I was expecting a game will close to little long term strategy and way too fiddly (there are so many bits in this game). And I got what I expected.

However, I had a lot of fun with this one. The decisions were actually nerve-wracking. Which action to perform? And more importantly, which action to get rid of!

Typically, drama in games comes from the ability to make big moves. Here. the drama comes from realizing the huge regrets from discarding some action card which you're now able to do because of some unexpected event, or seeing all of your plans fall apart because of another unexpected event.

The game itself has a very good flow.

I'm probably going to get rid of this title though; it's way too complex for non-gamers, and not nearly strategic or tactcial for gamers.

After my 1st game I didn't think I will love it, but with each play it gets better. Wonderful crisis management game - unpredictable and quite tense. Seems like a very simple game at first (because it IS simple rules-wise), but all decisions are meaningful. 

Players feel continously constrained because of limited action availability (you can use only half of 12 actions every phase), which leads to many interesting dillemas. Every turn you play 1 action card and discard 1, so you have to decide in advance which action will be redundant in the current phase. Unfortunately random events can and will render your strategy obsolete, forcing you to constantly change your plans. This game is definatelly not for faint-hearted and control freaks!

Plus the card turning mechanic to distribute goods is both innovative and fun.

UPDATE: Modified my score a bit. It seems this game lacks staying power. Even though event cards are random and different in every game, our plays started to feel kinda samey...

I've always enjoyed worker placement style games where you are working both to gain VP but also to avoid end of turn catastrophe (paying tribute, piety, grain). Quite a simple game, but the variable events make it interesting and the action cards mechanic where you choose your action but must discard another card works well. Just enough decision making to make it interesting, but avoids being a brain burner.

A very different game to [i]Pillars of the Earth[/i] but has the same feel - i.e. a clean, well-designed game with a good link to its source material.  It does that whole [i]In the Year of the Dragon[/i] thing where you have to take certain actions to get VPs, but those actions are usually different to the things that you need to do to avoid disaster at the end of each year.

Much of the game feels like an uphill struggle.  However, on 2nd playing, several potential strategies were revealed and some enjoyment was had.  Despite this, some of the negative events that are semi-randomly thrown out at you can lead to frustratingly disastrous results.  I traded this away for Troyes.

Not at its best with two players, but it is playable and it's a good game. A fairly standard Euro, with a reasonable balance of luck, player chaos, and planning.

Simple action selection to gather ressources. Most of the game is about getting ressources for the taxes at  the end of the  round. After that, the next round plays nearly the same, since there is not really any engine being built (maybe the houses an medical knowledge a little bit). The event cards are a big random factor (but the "deterministic" Euro-part would too shallow without this randomness). Very nice illustrations by Michael Menzel and good components as well. Not much else to come back for.

Introduces some truly new (to me) concepts, such as event/resource card "orientation" that gives all players a different benefit while also impacting the benefit wheel for the starting player. It is a struggle early on to just survive, as the story develops you feel immersed within the theme. A very well designed game, super fun to play even with two. Can be played light or heavy. Seems better overall than PotE.

Looks like Pillars but isn't anything like it.  Much more strategic game although there are tactical elements that come into play based on opponents chooses.  The game is really tight and it not based on getting goods and building something because there are needs for taxes, piety, and food that need to be rectified for every chapter of the game (4).  just a great tight resource management game, I had high hopes for the game and it surpassed it which is rare

Much better game than Pillars of Earth. Based on the same authors novel and has same art but plays very differently.

More changing resource cubes into VPs. The action selection mechanic is relatively novel, but there's not much really to set it aside from 100 other Euros. Apart from the fact that, frankly, it's just too random. And that's not a good thing here.

At the moment one of my favourite games, because it is never boring. Everytime you have face to new situations and react with other strategies.

There's some choice during your turn created by the card position. It's another game where you build a production engine (that'll end up yielding victory points), while profiting from the good events on the cards and coping through the bad ones. A decent game that just makes the grade due to the variation between games - 44 cards provided, but only 24 used each game.

Update: After a couple more plays I've had enough. Card effects make planning a luckfest. Too chaotic. Some sort of insurance mechanism to veto one card per Act might improve this. The shine has worn right off for this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As the novel, this game was eclipsed by [i]Pillars of the Earth[/i], even when it deserves to shine with its own light. Again a race to exchange goods and get victory points, but this time with clever and original mechanics, like the following: a) The income is based on cards that also give the other players resources, so the way that those  are layed on the board determine who get what; b) These cards also have events and establish special bonus for the active player, depending, again, in how they are layed on the board, and c) The need to burn one action card to play one gives the game a constant feel of tension. Good deep family game, it deserves a try once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A clever and elegant boardgame. I'm a bit upset by the necessity to gather a lot of different things by the end of each round: it takes too much room in the game (and in the strategy). I'd rather feed my family/workers as in most other games and be done with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Giving this a 2/5 because it's such a confused design. The part of the game where you place the square card to determine who gets what and how you interact with the track is REALLY cool. The problem is no one figured out what to do with this cool mechanism and just slapped it on a dusty old resource collection game with too many currencies that feel irrelevant and points that are either hard to come by, or come by the half dozen. If you're interested in design, give this a look/play, but otherwise keep walking.

It's not similar to Pillars of the Earth, and it's not nearly as good as Pillars, either. Some events are insane--and can last for all 6 turns if they're pulled on the first one--which happened in our game.

RATING: 8
(provisional) For me, this was much better than Pillars of the Earth, with a real sense of struggling to keep afloat without inadvertently helping your opponents too much.  The action selection system is almost excellent, marred only by the overly obvious shifting of action valuations during the game, making discards a little too obvious too often. Oh, and remembering penalties was a pain too.  
But it flowed well, was very easy to understand and the narrative elements felt integral rather than forced.

World Without End -- Played three- and four-player.

I was initially interested in this because it has this cool mechanism whereby players receive goods based on the orientation of a card.

It seemed to me that the game's key mechanism would require four players to feel right, but it works well with only three.

The game uses only a portion of it's cards, so each session should have a different character.  In our first, only two new buildings were made available for construction.  In our second, I think only one building went unbuilt.  Our second session was particularly chaotic, so I'm glad I had played it once before.  If that second session were my only experience of the game, I might be turned off from it.  As it is, I like the variety.

Each time a player uses a card from his hand, he must discard another.  Which cards are used, and which are discarded changes over the course of the game.  And the choice is always angst-ridden.  Good angst!

There's a sense of the flow of time, and for those familiar with the book, the flavor text on the event cards contributes a sense of story as well.

Played 1 4P game. The 'turn-the-event-card-around' is a pretty novel mechanic, and so is the agonising decision to play an action card and ditch another action card simultaneously.

With the imminent mandatory payment at the end of every chapter, WWE feels a bit like In the Year of the Dragon. However, the event cards are unpredictable, and some can affect the game in a negative way. I'm not a fan of how some of the events can negate your previous plans, like how I changed wool into cloth only to find out the next turn that no more wool or cloth could be sold at the market. I enjoy some randomness in games, but appreciate some way to at least anticipate or mitigate it.

Interesting mechanics that I don't find in other games are a big selling point for me. In World WIthout End, I love how you angle each event card to determine what income each player receives for that turn. The event cards that come up can feel swingy, but once you've played a few times, you learn the bad ones to where you can somewhat plan for them. Most all of the games I've played of this have seen extremely close scores. I'm also a big fan of the novel this game is booked upon by Ken Follett, so the theme is interesting to me due to that. I like Pillars of the Earth (the book) a bit more, but that game fell flat for me as just another worker placement game whereas this one really shines.

Interesting worker placement. 

The components and artwork are very nicely done. I like how you actually add buildings and structures to the town board as the game progresses.

Liking this a lot after a few plays. Governed by a series of 24 events, spread out, six each, through four chapters, the game develops slowly, with tension mounting along the way. Not a lot of interaction, but enough table talk to more than make up for it. The 'payment' issue at the end of each 'chapter' keeps short and long-term goals elegantly balanced. Each 'chapter's six events are chosen from a possible eleven events, so each time you play, you're confronted with different scenarios, including the number of buildings you are (or are not) going to build in an individual game. Should keep this fresh and challenging each time. There are some tough events. Nothing overtly nasty, like in El Grande, where an opponent can knock you off stride, big time,but things that can get to you, anyway. Newcomers liked it a lot, too. This'll be hitting the table quite a few times in the days/weeks/months ahead. Newcomers were relatives, close by, and I can see it coming down off the shelf a lot.

I want to like this game a lot -- the card mechanism is really ingenious, and I love how it drives the game.  There were just a few times during the game that I planned for things to happen and they didn't happen.  That led to a few turns that I couldn't do anything.  Perhaps I just have to go into it thinking that they might not, and then I won't feel so disappointed.  Even so, all the scores were close and it was a beautiful presentation.

Interesting game, with a similar look to Pillars of the Earth but a very different feel. After one play (2er), I like this one better. The game did take longer than I'd hoped, but presumably this would improve with repeated play (but with more players, not sure...).

The game is played in 4 "Chapters," each with 6 rounds. Each Chapter starts with a random event (many feel like a very random slap in the face!) -- the game comes with 11/Chapter, but you only play with 6 randomly chosen ones. Then, earn income (with a cool mechanism like in Hatu Matu: turn the event card so the income possibilities, printed on each corner, point to a specific player). In each round, players will play 1 action card and discard another (all 12 again available for next Chapter) -- very clever action/role selection! The actions give you resources, allow you to take board actions, build houses (of different types), earn income from 2 houses, etc. At the end of each Chapter, pay taxes, suffering significant penalties if you cannot.

With more players, I'd expect resources to be even tighter, and the game more painful. Hopefully in a good way ....

I have only played this game three times at the time of writing this, so I am still formulating my opinion on the game.

The game is very unforgiving about the need for Piety, Gold and Food every turn too, but that is something that you just have to account for.

Agreable game, that plays along quite nicely. The events can have a big impact on the game. Since there's no way to know if and when they occur, it's hard to pursue a clear strategy. It's mainly a game of tactics and opportunistic VP scoring. But in that, it succeeds in being fun and not too chaotic.

I love how there are short-term decisions (event card placement), medium-term decisions (some of the action cards), and long-range planning (houses or seals on buildings).

Action cards to collect resources to pay your dues and make a bit of a contribution to building the town. All played out against a backdrop of semi-random events that can severely disrupt your plans.

First game (2-player) was by the book (with attached baby wheels), and lacked tension - it's just too easy to avoid pain. Some tweaking/restricting of grain/piety availability is needed.

Second play (4-player) felt like the real deal: a world of pain, with players regularly screwed by the events and struggling (& failing) to pay their dues at the end of each chapter.

One play. Good players will score more points, but equally leveled players' score will be decided by luck it seems to me. In my first game the 3 best player (out of 4) ended up within 2 points of each other. With an other event card in the last round, the order could have been reversed, so it came down to luck, and that's a pitty.

An excellent game that captures the story well. 
I note that some have said that this game can be a bit random,I respectfully think that they are missing the point. In games like pillars of the Earth, or Castle for all Seasons you can plan a long term stratergy, however, in World Without End this becomes more subtle. The book deals with the realities of Medieval life, where despite your best plans, you live in a hard world and you have to deal with what life throws at you and while hard work brings small reward it is easy to loose it all. The game reflects this well: Opportunities to earn victory points seem come mostley in 1's & 2's, however to earn  3 - 6 points depends on you making opportunities. But if you have not allowed for the end of chapter "Duties" the penalties can cost you dear!. While it is important to grab the larger scoring oppertunites, don't miss the smaller 1's & 2's, in this game they all add up. 

Overall if you accept that you are in a story and the story is bigger than you ; you have to make the most of the present while still planning for the last two chapters ( where the game develops )  then it works 
brilliantly.

I originally rated this 8.5, but after reapeted plays it has to be higher.

Solid euro but brutal (at least with 2) and with a pronounced 1st player advantage (so 3p seems like a bad player count). Plenty of content we never even really got into because surviving was challenging enough. Could see this really shinning with 4 but for now we need to play more to try different strategies. Turns are near simultaneous so once we got going, it was actually a pretty quick game.

This took a while to grow on me, but now it feels like there is not too much randomness and rather than saying the game hates you and is out to make sure you fail, it is more a case of 'the game isn't keen on you and if your turn your back, expect to get smacked round the head. Pay attention and you'll be fine'.

I feel like this might scratch the same itch as a Castle for All Seasons with the Winter cards in play, so not sure how much long term appeal it will have, but I'm enjoying it so far.

Much more interesting than the Pillars of the Earth, but also very random. But in TPofE drawing the workers from the bag could help someone very much, or be very unfair for someone other. Here the events are bad for everyone. Ok sometimes a event is for you a disaster and for someone else no, but generally the game is more fair. 

You can try different ways. The game is short. Not a gamers game, but as a family game very good.

Sok apró dologra kell figyelni és próbál erősen tematikus lenni. Jól ismert mechanizmusokat kombinálgat gyönyörű Michael Menzel-es grafikával. Sajnos a sok apró szabály miatt nehéz az első parti, de alapjában véve nem bonyolult a játék.

A játékban fura érzés, hogy a körönként begyűjtendő nyersanyagok fele egy olyan mechanizmussal érkezik a játékoshoz, amelyet csak 25%-ban tudok befolyásolni. Persze ettől még nem egy rossz játék.

Az akciókat kártyákkal hajtjuk végre. Ez a mechanika hajaz kicsit a Cuba mechanikájára. Annyi plusz van itt, hogy a 12 akciólapból (mindenkinek minden kör elején ugyanaz az akciókártya csomag áll a rendelkezésére) minden alkalommal egyet kijátszunk, és egyet használatlanul eldobunk.

Ja, és egyáltalán nem hasonlít a mechanizmus a Pillars of the Earth játékra, ebben nincs worker-placement (munkáslehelyezős) mechanika egyáltalán.

Összességében egy becsületesen összerakott kis játék, de semmi különös. Ha csak ez az egy játékom lenne, nem lennék szomorú, de mivel nagyon sok játékom van, ezt nem fogom beszerezni. Sokadik játéknak azok számára ajánlom, akik szeretik Ken Follett-et vagy a középkori témát.

World Without End has several elements I normally don't like, and yet it appeals to me very much. The first characteristic is all the negative events that cause players to lose resources, gold, etc. As with In the Year of hte Dragon, I usually steer clear of games where negative events are pervasive. The second element is the randomness of event cards, which in World Without End get revealed and give players no time to anticipate and plan for the consequences. Despite this, I find World Without End a compelling game that continues to invite repeated play. I love the mechanism of placing the event cards and distributing the goods pictured to all players, and the link between that and the rondel at the bottom of the game board. I'm not entirely sure yet why I like this game despite at least some mechanics that are usually a turn-off, but I do.

Nice game of action selection. I was slightly overwhelmed by the number of possible actions, but after one game I got used to that. The game is dominated by random events which can easily spoil your plans and tear down everything you have built during a turn which felt frustrating for some players. Makes the game a little bit too random for my taste. Planning was near impossible. Rating after two plays.

RATING: 8.5
A euro that doesn't feel too euroish. Thematically most of the games' mechanisms work really well and you feel like you are in the sinister middle-ages. Resources scarcity at its best makes for a game that builds up turn angst a' plenty. Planning ahead is really hard to do since you are very dependent on your coplayers' choices and of course the events that occur or can occur. However, this is an interactive element I really dig.

Thanks to the event decks and the four chapters, the fact you never know which six of the eleven cards are included and in what order they will appear plus the uncertainty what your coplayers will grant you when choosing how to lay the event card, this game takes you away from the more common micromanagement bull and to a game where you have to adapt fast to the changing situations. And even with all these uncertainties the game is neatly balanced.    

Raised by 1 - this game is just great. I love the unpredictability and I love the scarcity of things. Plus I love the artwork and the way they handled integration of the buildings. The board is like a painting. This game is a masterpiece in every way. Can't wait to play again. Rightfully this one deserves a place in my Top Ten, but I just can't decide which one to sacrifice. Actually the game is so atmosphere-dripping I am now interested in reading the book to see if the theme is as good transfered as it seems to be with all the flavor text on the Event cards. 

ps: the game should be played by people equally experienced with the game.Knowing what event cards might pop up and what their effects are helps big time. Newbies still like the game but can become awestruck in a negative sense due to the effect of some cards.

Got this to compare the disaster-like elements to games like ITYOTD or Peloponnes. As a side effect I think I may have come to the conclusion that (between this and Santiago de Cuba) I find Rieneck's games pleasant to play. The specific cube-pushing resource conversions are simple and uncreative, but the games are fast and smooth and I can quickly find the important strategic questions. [Update: My brief Rieneck crush has been ended by Pillars of the Earth, which I found really uninspiring. Unplayable really.]

The game structure is interesting. There are four "chapters" of six rounds each. Each round reveals a random event (which may have persisting effect) and at the end of each chapter you have to be able to pay food, "piety," and an amount of money rolled on a die. Each player has a deck of 12 action cards refreshed at the beginning of each chapter. Each round, each player on their turn plays one card and discards another. Unexpectedly, the cards are not revealed simultaneously, and neither is there an inherent blocking of players going after you. There is some blocking (probably not enough) in that actions may draw resources or other opportunities that are limited in supply.

Also of interest is that each round the current start player gets to orient a card which determines which player will get which small perk. This orientation also affects how far an event marker will move on a Rondel, which usually but not always gives the current start player another perk.

Possible criticisms are too little player interaction, too much potential to get screwed by the random events (which can e.g. render useless an action you were counting on taking), and perhaps high risk for some monotony at times. Since you always need roughly the same things each chapter in order to avoid being penalized, your immediate "to-do list" tends to look similar. Unlike ITYOTD, there is little risk of bumping into the other players, so it often makes no difference in which order you take the actions you need. In a 4p game it's possible for crucial goods (notably grain) to run out, or get "hate drafted" by players not really needing it, but with fewer than 4p I doubt supplies would ever run out. (There are no scaling rules.)

The quantity of currencies is kind of silly: Money, grain, wood, stone, wool, cloth, piety, loyalty, and medical knowledge. One thing I do appreciate is that money, ever necessary to pay taxes, has no corresponding action that produces it in usable quantities (unless you're selling cloth... which requires wool to make, and there is no action that produces wool). It can be interesting (and sometimes futile) to figure out how you're going to get money.

After learning this game and playing a couple times myself (using two players), and one time playing with my son, I have yet to really assess the full potential of this game.  I love pillars of the earth, and I do like this game, but have yet to really assess the replay-ability of it.  There are features I really like, and maybe a few clunky things, but as a whole I do like it, but need to play it a few more times with a larger amount of players.  I do feel that 3-4 players will make it more enjoyable.

World Without End shares the Kingsbridge location of the earlier novel, but occurs 200 years later. Similarly, the game shares many themes but is a new standalone game.
As citizens of Kingsbridge, players need to take care of the following areas: Building, Trading, Religion, Feeding, and Medical Knowledge. Each turn an event card is flipped that defines available player actions. Victory points can be won in numerous ways, e.g. by creating buildings or taking care of sick people.

I like the action card mechanism, and the event card orientation is interesting (although I liked the similar mechanism in Deukalion more), but the rest of the game is very dull. In large part this is because the only permanent things you get are houses and medical knowledge. This means that there is little differentiation of player positions and goals throughout the game. I don't mind this in a short game, but this one is much too long given this (the full 4-round game is likely to be 2 hours unless all the players are reasonably experienced).

Provisional rating, one play.  Chaotic and repetitive.  Far, far too much impact from the random events, and frustrating that so much of the time is spent preparing for the chapter-end tithes.  I had no sense of progress through the game, with resources being lost as soon as gained, and no engine being built - shortly after we built our second houses, an event prevented income being collected, then another knocked them down.  Could forgive those issues if the game was shorter.

The book is a sequel to Pillars of the Earth, but really, there's not much in common here with the Pillars game. Players play 6 actions and discard 6 each game round from a hand of 12 possible, with each player having the same action deck.

This game was brutal, absolutely oppressive. Not an enjoyable experience at all. At the end of each round of 6 actions, you have these mandatory taxes and duties you have to pay, 2 piety, 2 grain, and a bunch of gold depending on the die roll. Generally, you only collect one thing each action, so most of the entire round is spent on subsistence actions, just trying to collect the stuff you need to pay what you owe. Some actions take multiple turns, collecting some wool, turning it into cloth, selling it, so there's almost no time in the game to actually think about scoring points, you're just trying to avoid the penalties all game. The penalties are pretty severe, losing actions, having action cards taken from you randomly, so if that does happen, you fall further behind. Plus, event cards come out each action, which can totally hose you and your plans. I spent a good chunk of a round attempting to get a house on the board (collect gold, resources, play the build house card) hoping to get a source of gold as income, only to have an event card wipe out the house the very next turn. I literally got nothing for it, never used it once.

The one good thing in the game is the event card resource allocation system, where the current player chooses the orientation of the card, and each player around the table gets the resource that is pointing at them, such as points, cubes, money etc. Somebody needs to re-use this, in a *fun* game.

There are a couple really clever ideas here- one of them is that you have a hand of 12 action cards and every round (of 6) must choose one card to play and one card to discard. This leads to a somewhat interesting hand management problem where you must decide how to progressively limit your options. There's another clever idea or two in there, but unfortunately it is kind of wasted on what is otherwise a pretty boring and straightforward game. I particularly dislike the random unpredictable things that can happen to you from the event cards that come up each round. In general I don't mind games that have this element and force you to roll with the punches, but not when the rest of the game is a dry exercise in planned resource collection, e.g. "I need two grain by the end of the round or I'll be penalized- I have one so I'll play this card that gives me 1 grain on my turn. Oh wait an event came up that says we can't play that card this turn! Darn, I guess I lose points at the end of this round." 

I think whoever likes Pillars of the Earth will probably like this- they are both boring exercises in resource collection/conversion. At least in Pillars though there is an amount of interesting uncertainty that comes from the worker placement choices of the other players. In World Without End there is much less interaction- the obstacles that get in your way aren't other players but rather the random events that screw you. That's lame.

RATING: 5
It's kind of impressive that this game is a sequel to Pillars of the Earth, and yet isn't the same type of game as its predecessor.  The only similarities are the theme and the use of building materials to complete certain tasks, but beyond that, it's entirely different.  The worker placement aspect of the game has been replaced with card actions, and the turn events have been replaced with cards that present the event and also give a benefit to each player.  Unfortunately, the game still has a strong luck element, with the event cards, the die roll, and the plague markers, which can devastate your plans, and since each turn you have to select one action to perform and one to discard, you might throw away a card that didn't seem useful, and then becomes valuable.  It's frustrating, and in a game that seems to promote careful decision-making, it feels out of place.

it is definitely a better game than Pillars, but there are some game-breaking event cards, that almost ruined the game for me.  For instance, one of the best ideas, and most strategic, is the ability to choose your action from a set of cards, and then choose one to discard.  This forces you to narrow your gameplay, and plans turns ahead of time.  However, there is an event that causes you to randomly discard your action instead of choosing -- everyone does this, so it totally voids that neat aspect of play.  An extreme downer, and nobody liked it.  That aside, the events were cool, and the method of selecting your bonus for the round was good.  I liked it, with reservations.

Po pierwszym niezbyt pozytywnym wrażeniu, gra zaczyna mi się podobać. Jest szybka na 2 osoby (ok. 60-70 min). Świetnie oddaje klimat trudności życia w średniowieczu. Co chwilę coś się traci (a to banici, a to coś innego) bo wydarzeń negatywnych na kartach jest bardzo dużo, kary za niespełnienie zobowiązań na koniec rozdziałów są ciężkie, podobnie jak i same zobowiązania. Znajduję jakąś masochistyczną przyjemność w grania w tę grę :)

Nie podoba mi się: dość długi czas rozkładania elementów i niewiele interakcji (ale dobre choć to co jest).

Un euro con una mecánica de juego bastante curiosa, da igual el número de jugadores, siempre se juega bien, hay a quien no le agrada porque en algunos turnos hay que aportar recursos y dinero para evitar penalizaciones, no es mi caso.

No era el euro más potente de mi estantería aunque si agradable de jugar, pero era demasiado para mi novia y a mis colegas "culo-duros" les sabía a poco, por ello, a día de hoy duerme en la estantería del simpatiquísimo Luiyo.

oh the pain!...I love having to keep up with all the needs in the game...I get the same feeling with "In the Year of the Dragon"...great bits and board...all the different things you can do on the board are fun...

Stresful game ;) Nice mechanism, nice gameplay. Nothing that special, but it was fun to play it. It's not very strategic though as some cards can ruin your plans - if you know that before the play it will be ok.

Very nice to look at, but hardly fun to play. Random events render careful planning useless way too often.

This is a very nice, fast-paced game filled with torturous decisions.  It is also packed with replay value, since only about half the event cards are in each game, and they will determine which projects are available during the game, and how the plague spreads and plays out.  The event card mechanism is a brilliant innovation, providing instantaneous or chronic effects, determining who catches the plague, and then based on the orientation chosen by the active player, granting an income of sorts for all the players, and a specific favor (or misfortune) for the active player.  All with one square card, that is very easy to understand, and its orientation to movement spots on the board.

I played this game a couple of times one afternoon, and it was interesting enough to catch my attention. We were only playing two-player, so the resources were more plentiful, but I enjoyed the play/discard aspect of each action phase. Some of the event cards are crushing if they show up early in the round, but they hurt everyone, so it’s balanced. I also liked how each event card gives a resource to each player, but the lead player decides the distribution orientation. The game ends a bit suddenly, and I think we were playing the tower incorrectly.

I want to play this again with a better understanding of the rules and more players to get the full effect of the resource scarcity.

06/01/2010 - After 1 play, I found the game to be process-heavy and purposeless--just a run-of-the-mill euro that only stands on its innocuous rules and pretty art to get the minimum number of sales necessary to justify its existence.  I've read World Without End, and liked it, which was probably the only reason I found this game to be tolerable.  If you're looking for an exceptional game, this isn't it.

Granjeros, laneros y maestros constructores se esfuerzan por conseguir riqueza y prestigio. Se ganan puntos de prestigio por construir, por cuidar enfermos y por mantener una vida piadosa y leal. Hay una carta de evento cuadrada que define el ingreso de cada jugador según la oriente el jugador inicial.

A brutal but elegant game that really makes you work for that win.  Lose focus during a chapter and don't concentrate on getting your mandatory payments, and you WILL lose, but if you know that going in, you've only got yourself to blame.  Also, some truly genius design that constantly wows me.

Oh, and the board is BEAUTIFUL.

This is as good as Pillars of the Earth too, I really can't understand why this doesn't get the same recognition.

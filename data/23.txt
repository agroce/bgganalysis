RATING: 7.9
Of all the board/war games of my childhood pre-teen, this one stands out as most enjoyable.  Very strong theme and a real narrative drive behind the actual play, which can admittedly be highly chaotic.  It needs a reprint (of the original version).  A point's been docked because I have some doubt whether it would really hold up if I revisited it.

RATING: 9
Great game! Love the personality cards for the non-player monarchs. Starting races are not balanced, but this isn't a problem, as it there are lots of alliances, and it is obvious even to new players who the "power" countries are. great troop type (go lepers go!). Would probably actually kill to get the rumored Scarlet Empires sequel.

One of few good board game TSR came out with.  Very hard to find.  You run around trying to recruit kingdoms to your cause.  The 25th anniversary version was recently released.

From Ebay for $11 on 11/4/09, part of a 3 games set from Charles Dunn.  Punched, boxe has tape residue and wear but content is in excellent condition.

NOt so good.  Sieges are very tough, and combat can be either really deadly or extremely uninteresting.  The game itself is really TOO much die-rolling, and not a lot you can do if the dice screw ya.  Okay for a one-time play, but I'd prefer not to play again.

I'm going off of my group's memory here, circa 1979-1980.  If it wasn't for Avalon Hill, this TSR game may have forever finished us off of boardgames.  There just wasn't enough about this fantasy setting to pry us away from our more fulfilling D&D or AD&D campaigns.  Thank goodness for Diplomacy--a game that transitioned us to boardgames without the unnecessary density that this one inspired.  In fairness, I really need to dust it off again after so long and give it another go, just to see if it may have more to offer now vs then.

RATING: 6
Played this game with relish when I was in high school, because it played out as if you were reading a great fantasy novel or creating the arc for a role-playing campaign. However, it had always bothered me, even then during the game's heyday, that it took so long to play. The basic mechanics are fairly straightforward. Battles and seiges are handled very cleverly and still hold up as a model of a good combat system. The various characters, monsters, treasures, races, and kingdoms give this game a rich, heady mix for fantasy lovers. And Dave Trampier's unparalleled map art really sets the tone for this TSR classic. So why the mediocre rating? Because you really need to be something of an old-school fantasy fan and a bit of a wargaming grognard to fully enjoy and appreciate the game. It takes a long time to play and requires a bit of setting up. Players have many choices to make on their turn which means there is a lot of down time-- which players will use to plot against you. It takes a while to develop an empire and player diplomacy slows the game even more. It can easily repel the ignorant or those used to snappier Euro-style games. In other words, it suffers from all the disadvantages that more contemporary games of the genre and scale have learned to overcome. (There IS a 20-turn limit, however!) Still, this can be a fascinating game with a close group that wants a genuinely rich fantasy game. (Like a Games Workshop game, but without the gratuitous skulls and battle-madness). Your best bet is to find an experienced hand with an original copy of the game and settle in for a lazy Saturday afternoon and evening.

It goes on and on and on.. The Rahmans did excellent background work though, and the graphics were great for their time, so I can't sandbag the rating completely. (Ours was the old TSR edition, natch, with piles of Dragon magazines for errata and extra rules...)

I loved this game, and I always thought it had a better-designed fantasy world for RPG use than most of the ones published as such. I created a lot of house rules and new counters, like the Djinn and Spiders. I thought I had sold this game fifteen years ago, and I just found my copy while preparing for a move! It's battered and yellowed, but I want to play it.

This is a tough one to rate.  The game as written shows it's age and the rules are horribly organized.  The components are rather sparse, but effective.  It goes on quite a long time.

Best multi-player game ever (but our universe is limited). Good times playing this game with kids and friends eons ago, and I don't even like sci-fi or fantasy.

We own the original and the Anniversay re-issue.

25th Aniversary Edition
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played once.  Fun game, if a little random.  No two games play out exactly the same, although there will be similarities.  Promotes the building of 'uber-stacks' (of counters). Enough depth and gameplay options to keep you playing for a long, long time.  Best experienced with a group of regular players.  The map board is beautiful.  I have the 25th anniversary edition.  The publisher royally screwed up the rules, to the point that the game is unplayable.  Fortunately, fans have taken the author's original intention (for this edition) and edited the rules into a working format.  Check the Yahoo Divine Right group.  Plays well even with just two players; if playing with more than 4, use the simultaneous sequence of play variant mentioned in the intermediate rules; the game bogs down otherwise.  Despite all of these flaws, I love the epic feel of this game and the narrative that can develop; feels like reading a fantasy novel sometimes.

I played this one in high school, and still have the original version.

Looking back on it, Playing the game was a lot of fun, though it was tough to get any mammoth battles fought, as alliances constantly shifted. I remember the Black Hand being the most fun to play.  

Great theme, which really makes the game. Pirates, orcs, trolls, elves, undead, and plenty of interesting human kings make this game a blast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Just pulled out my TSR copy of this yesterday and soloed a 4 player game of it. One thing I noticed about this game is: It has a severe case of player elimination, the Dwarves in my game attacked the Trolls on Turn one, had a unlikely throw and the king was captured and it was game over for them. Then the Muetar king went to the temple and tried some praying and rolled a 1 and wham-bang he was dead too (he was in the lead at this time) and it came down to a show down between the Trolls and the Rombune and the Trolls won by sacrificing one of their regulars at the altar and destroyed the fleet the Rombune King was traveling on and a bad fate roll for the King and he died too. 

It was AWESOME fun solo, the randomized personalities, the alliance system with the NPC kingdoms, the back and forward, the narrative and provoking world the game is situated in, the randomize chit-pull turn order mechanism makes for a great solo experience, there is a zillion ways to mess with the other players and come back from the brink of disaster. At the same time the game rewards good play and controlled risk taking. Love the map and the narrative and love the low counter density. 

Simply brilliant. 

A quick "hello" to those that are stuck on Fright Isle.

[TSR edition] Wonderful flavor and mood, with an absolutely gorgeous map and box. The game itself, though, was a real letdown. Very random and un-strategic, never delivering the kind of engrossing experience I had hoped it would. Bottom line: great fluff, poor gameplay. Would rate about 2 points lower without the excellent graphics and ambiance.

I've never wanted to invest the time and energy into making a game "better", but Divine Right makes me want to.  In the actually mechanics of the game, it's not that awesome.  But, with some modifications to the siege rules, an alteration of the starting powers, and maybe a few other mods.  Too bad I'm going to leave before I get to.

You're basically playing on an unlicensed version of Middle Earth, and everything is ridiculous. You roll a d6 to see if you get reinforcements. You roll a d6 to see if you charm whole kingdoms into joining your side. You roll a d6 to see if your sieges are successful. The results, as expected, are almost completely random, and depend on your starting position, since the only real variables under your control is the kingdoms you ally yourself with, the number of troops each offers you, and where you get the balance of your forces from.

There is no economy in the game, which is really what it sorely needs the most. There's no disincentive to letting people stomp your castle if they come in with overwhelming force. There's no reason not to just throw the biggest possible stacks at anything because you can't lose by losing part of a kingdom (except relative VPs).

A tall pole on the road to viable fantasy wargames... but still well short.

In my one and only play of this game, I played as the Dwarves, who face a pretty impossible starting situation. First I took over the Elves, who were annihilated (except for their leader) in an attack on Immer. Then the forces of Pon plus the forces of Dwarf were annihilated in an attack on a city in eastern Muetar. 

Then I built a couple of barbarians to the north, invaded the undefended Zorn, and after being down by about 45 points, with no real army to speak of, one city plundered and not a single plundering to my name, won the game by rolling a six on the siege and a one on the leader roll. 110 points (or, as normal people might say, 22, since all points are in denominations of 5... go figure.)

So that took four hours. We only played to round ten.

The best fantasy war game, mixing fantasy, randomness and strategy.  Now re-released.  Enough optional rules to fill a small house.  The original version remains the best.  A great sandbox type game.  Love how the alliances are quite tenuous: use them now because they probably will be gone next turn.  I spent ages looking for a copy until finally spotting one in Armchair Books in Rochester, New York.  A full game can take some time.  Even can be soloed in a long session.  The varying personalities of the other characters is pure genius.  I hope the re-re-release eventually sees the light of day.

RATING: 5
Pros: Great theme, very vivid 'medieval/fantastic' feel. Lots of fun bribing other nations to join you. The personality cards add a nice twist to the game. I also like the main battle mechanic, which gives advantage to outnumbering your opponent without giving too much
Cons: Mechanics betray the game's age. Very, very luck-oriented (especially when trying to convince a nation to join you). Lots of downtime, even when playing with only 3 players. While the game packs some great ideas, it doesn't quite gel together as more modern games do.
Verdict: good game especially considering its age. Could be coaxed into playing one more time, but probably not more than that.

Much much too long. I'd like to play again, but that's not happening. When we were 13 and only had three games, we could play this often enough that there was some excitement surrounding Oggsbogg the Ogre. Now he's just another chit.

RATING: 4
The one time I played this game (with 6 players) made for a very looong evening with a low ratio of fun to time spent.  I suspect that some of the reviewers who rate this game highly do so partly out of nostalgia.

The game moves way too slowly and entire army stacks can be wiped out by random events or a single poor combat die roll... which means you need to restart the laborious and time consuming task of rebuilding your army, yet again.  

My one and only play of Divine Right was back in the early 1990s.  So while my remembrance of game details is fuzzy, the ennui I experienced playing this game is not something I'm likely to forget.

YMMV.

1979 TSR second ed.  

A very basic game at its core (no CRT) but the map and units are great (Trampier!).  Lots of specific situations/units can occur but they are pretty intuitive.  The 'event points' on the map are also one of the brilliant chrome pieces in this game.  Plenty of variants to add to taste, as in about 100 pages worth in the junkyard manual.  The kind of great fantasy flavor lacking in many modern games can be found here.   Sure, there can be some wild luck rolls with sieges, leader death, events and diplomacy rolls but anyone who likes a good narrative combat experience will embrace the quirks of the game.  A real fantasy gem.

Fabulous, nicely replayable, fun.  In many respects, this is my favourite type of game.  I love the theme and the variety of play options.  Plays well with two or more.  I am very sad that it is so hard to come by and so expensive on eBay.  I now own a bunch of TSR sets and an anniversary edition. Much prefer the look of the TSR version.

The anniversary edition has lots of problems, so they are making another.

Great theme, but the base wargame mechanics are just not that great, so I don't think even the cool magic stuff can save this one. Tedious, slow and dull.

This game is so caught up in my memories of DnD, and non-Avalon Hill games (Ogre, Asteroid, Terrible Green Things) that I don't know how I would rate it now. So my rating is based off of my memory of what I felt back in 1981. Back then I loved it. It fired the imagination this map with its kingdoms and groups. I do remember that the start was problematic. Played one game that ended on turn 2. Would probably never choose to play, but appreciate the memories.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game - Sure, its pure hex-and-counter 1970s fare, but my gaming group stalwarts and I love it.  It's not the gaming mechanism (which is clumsy, slow, and a bit too luck-prone); it's the theme - this game positively oozes theme and flavor. I played this game religiously as a 10-13 year-old and then picked it up nearly 15 years later and still loved it. To this day, if one of my friends were to ask, "Want to play some Divine Right?", I can't imagine answering "no."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic all-nighter. I have the 25th Anniversary Edition. Too baroque to be competitive these days, this is precisely the kind of wargame that got everyone screaming to put them on computers and have the circuits work out the hard bits for us, but really satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I bought this one way back.  If you have the time this is great game.  The mechanics are a little slow, especially if your enemy is on the other side of the map.  Watching your enemys ambassador getting burned at the stake is always a hoot, though.
I have never played a dull game of this and it holds a big sentimental value, as well.

A great multiplayer game.

Good theme, lots of great player interaction, but a bit long.

Waiting in anticipation for the revised version to be released.

RATING: 7
This is one of the all-time great games.  Diplomacy gives you a great deal of flexibility.  Anticipating opponent diplomacy makes each game different.  Highly recommended.

It does take a lot of time.  I'm lucky to play once a year, if that, and the rules are just all over the place.  Fortunately there's a lot of web resources to help.

This and Swords and Sorcery by SPI are poster children for 70's era fantasy boardgames. It is thematic, random and takes a LONG time to to play.

At this point in my life, I'd rather have the good memories than the game.

Looks and sounds like a better game than it is.  Very little interplay between forces on different parts of map.  Often comes down to who can besiege a city or two faster than anyone else.  However, the color and character of the game, with its diverse countries and leaders, shows how generic and bland modern fantasy games have become. Classic near miss.

There are very few well done fantasy war games. I'd love to see an updated edition of this game that addresses some of the drawbacks with the older game mechanisms; e.g., battles drag on turn after turn - they should be resolved more quickly in a single turn; e.g., taking multiple rounds within a single turn. The map is full of delightful locations with imaginative place names that are calling out for inventive adventures, perhaps associated with an event deck; adding a deck of event or story cards would provide a vehicle for moving the game forward at a quicker pace, as well as adding surprises and drama. The map needs a graphics/artistic upgrade, and could also do with a little redesign to make a naval strategy more relevant.

A classic wargame from the 1970s. It's got some nice mechanics, particularly the ability to ally neutral kingdoms, and a it plays pretty simply. However, there's also huge amounts of randomness in the game, from the random events to the medium-random combats. It's also way too easily to demobilize neutral countries, which can cut out a lot of the longer term strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating is purely based upon the enjoyment that my friends and I got out of this one in the late 70s and early 80s.  

No other "epic" fantasy game matches the chrome of this game.  

Players start as just another kingdom in this fantasy world.  Through the unique features of diplomacy and counter-diplomacy, a player could gain additional forces in the form of the other kingdoms who had unique personalities represented by drawn cards.

Who can't like a game with assassinations, ambassadors burned at the stake for failing to recruit barbarian allies, the Colossus (sp? - an Undead Monster formed out of a nearby battlefield), Juulute Wolfheart, the Scum, and, of course, the Black Knight!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
This is a great game, lots of fun.  We played in college when it first came out, and I recently broke it out again for my gaming group.  All had a good time.  You really need at least 4 players to make it fun.  It can be irritating waiting for one's turn to come up again, so you may want to try this one with other mini-games going in the background until your turn comes up or you are attacked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My old gaming group used to play Divine Right every month, for years. It's sort of a light wargame and sort of a random dicefest, but big colorful map and the tons of chrome really bring the game to life. It's like creating history in another world. Years later, I was in an early playtest group for the modern edition of Divine Right, and got to play Glenn Rahman himself. The man is literally a gentleman and a scholar, but suffers from severe analysis paralysis. Although most of the new advanced rules are cumbersome, they give experienced players lots of options to change things up and keep the game fresh. The additional features on the CD rom are great. I prefer the color scheme of the original TSR edition, but the new map is of high quality.

I have not played this since I was a kid so the rating may well be higher than it should be. But my brother and I got so many hours of pure joy out of this game that I feel I owe it a good rating. We played it again and again and again. My old copy was so worn that I bought another just to have it on my shelf. It's a fantasy game but has all the fundamentals of a wargame. The special races like the Black Hand just were terrific. This was Games of Thrones done 20 plus years ago. I will give another play sometime soon.

I can see the appeal, but there's way too much luck for a serious game and takes way too long for a light game.

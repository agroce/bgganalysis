Seriously underrated deckbuilder, most like Dominion and yet very different to it. Fixes most of its problems at the (debatable) expense of some extra complexity. I should also point out that I love the theme, though it will surely be a turn-off for some.

I consider Puzzle Strike to be a direct upgrade to Dominion. More player interaction, a vastly more interesting win condition, and unique starting decks (characters) all improve considerably on the original Dominion formula without straying very far afield.

It took me a while to warm to this game, but it might represent the best of Sirlin. 

I don't think it's a coincidence that over time I've come to appreciate this and Flash Duel more than Yomi and Codex. Sirlin talks a lot about his pedigree for 'balance' but really it's his feel for crafting asymmetry from an already-established system that shines. 

In my own life, I am an iterator. Puzzle Strike, with Shadows, represents success for Sirlin in his more noble goals: to create a complete game where the depth comes from the interplay between valuation (optimal strategy) and reading the game state (optimal tactics). 

The inevitable blowback is that with Puzzle Strike and Shadows, this game feels complete, and as such future content is a risk.

Εδώ έχουμε ένα deck building game με μάρκες αντί για κάρτες. Είναι εμνευσμένο από ένα videogame. Ουσιαστικά προσπαθείς να γεμίσεις την οθόνη (ταμπλό)  του αντίπαλου παίκτη με πετράδια προτού αυτός κάνει το ίδιο σε σένα. Παραλληλα προσπαθείς να κρατήσεις υπο έλεγχο τα δικά σου πετράδια είτε συγχωνεύοντας τα σε μεγαλύτερης αξίας, είτε στέλνοντας τα στον αντίπαλο. :arrrh:

Έχει πολύ περισσότερο interaction από άλλα deck building games ενώ γλυτώνεις και το άπειρο ανακάτεμα αφού οι μάρκες ανακατεύονται πολύ πιο εύκολα στο σακούλι τους από ότι οι κάρτες σε μια τράπουλα. Να σημειώσω πως υπάρχει και εφαρμογή για να κάνεις κλήρωση το ποιές μάρκες θα παίξουν σε κάθε παρτίδα. Επίσης το insert του παιχνιδιού είναι εξαιρετικό για την αποθήκευση και ταξινόμηση των περιεχομένων. :)

Το κουτί περιλαμβάνει αρκετούς διαφορετικούς χαρακτήρες για να διαλέξεις. Ο καθένας έχει 3 προσωπικές μάρκες που τον κάνουν να ξεχωρίζει από τους υπόλοιπους. Το παιχνίδι είναι δηλαδή κάπως ασύμμετρο. Παρόλο που είναι φτιαγμένο για παρτίδες 2 ατόμων υπάρχουν στο manual οδηγίες και για multiplayer μάχες μέχρι 4 άτομα. Δεν το δοκίμασα οπότε δεν μπορώ να εκφέρω άποψη για το αν λειτουργει σωστά.   

Δεν ενθουσιάστηκα χωρίς να σημαίνει ότι έχει κάτι αρνητικό το παιχνίδι. Απλά νομίζω έχει περάσει πλέον η μόδα των απλών deck building παιχνιδιών.  Το πως θα παίξεις το χέρι σου είναι αυτονόητο και η μόνη σοβαρή απόφαση είναι το ποια νέα μάρκα να αγοράσεις. Ένα πραγματικό καλό deck building πρέπει να προσφέρει περισσότερες δύσκολες αποφάσεις.

a fun game that captures the feel of the old SNES game of its namesake.  Yes it is a deck builder in disguise.  Yes it uses chips instead of cards.  

Generally, the largest reviewer gripe about this game is that they don't like using chips.  Honestly, I like the chips for many reasons.

First, they are well made.  They are solid and colorful and have a nice heft to them that most card stock used in games recently does not have.

Second, the chips work well with the tetris like mechanic and illusion of the game.  They look and feel like blocks coming down into your play area when you see them on your mat.

Lastly, it's a different tactile feel having the chips vs cards.  I have many deck builders all with cards.  This game offers something unique in its use of chips.  There is a visual appeal and feel to this game and its chips that sets it apart from other "deck builders"

Found used at a local shop and had to jump on it. Played 3 games. I really like this game so far. The gem pile mechanic is interesting, and it seems there can be some really deep play here. Just browsing the forums seems there is a metagame ala magic (control, beat down, and...the third escapes me ATM). I ended up buying Shadows and the promo chips based on the strength of those first few sessions. Here's to hoping it gets more time at the table and that it holds up. Tentatively an 8 right now

My other favorite deck builder. Only this one has a variable player abilities component, which I love. I will say though that this game is best with 2, in my opinion. I've played it with four and it just feels too out of control. The 1 on 1 battles are by far my favorite. In a 2 player game, this one is equal to Star Realms for me. I also love the chips instead of cards.

This game replaces dominion for me. There is less expansion and the game is more balanced. The characters adds a lot of excitement and the more immersive feeling. The implementation of gems and a win condition of not counting victory points is much more fun and elegant. You skip counting VP at end of game. The direct interaction that the gems provide and the cheer fun of combining and crashing gems is far superior to buy an province (that is essentially just a noninteractive/dead card in your deck). The chips make the setup time much faster! So all in all this game is a win. Get it and sell dominion. 

The direct confrontation part could make some (girlfriends) prefer dominion more though. Nongamers could also prefer dominion since its more simple.

I don't usually like to rate games as a "1" as most games truly don't deserve them, but I feel that I need to draw attention to the fact that David Sirlin, the designer of this game has behaved in ways that I find unacceptable and I think folks really should educate themselves before throwing money his way.

Mr. Sirlin's book, "Playing to Win" paints an extremely bleak portrait of what's going on in this guys head. What Sirlin's take on things essentially boils down to is that playing board and video games (read TOYS) should be a means of proving ones superiority over your friends and loved ones.  If you hold any other opinion, he's more than ready to tell you you're wrong.  He's told anyone who plays CCGs to leave his forums, nevermind if you're a fan of his work or a paying customer.  And then there's the whole part where he PLAGIARIZED someone else's work for the chip design in Puzzle Strike.

The following link, while humorous in nature, runs through the first chapter of Sirlin's book.  Jokes aside, take a look and ask yourself if you really want to encourage Sirlin any further.

I'm not telling anyone to not buy his games, but given that he is pretty much a one man operation, please keep in mind that you're truly voting with your dollars in this case.

It's best to think of Puzzle Strike as a combat game with deck-building mechanics. This game is highly interactive and it is highly tactical. 

Building a big engine for the win is hard in this game--sculpting your bag/deck tactically with a strategy built around the matchup is key. 

This is my favorite deck-builder. Give it time, patience, and get past your habits from other deck builders and you will probably see why. This game is an honest 10/10 for me.

Even though you are "attacking" each other, it feels similar to Dominion, except:

More complicated, it's easy to see that Provinces are best, but which purple chips you need is harder to tell.

More samey, while Dominion decks are all likely to have money and VP cards by game end, what they do on each turn is usually pretty different, whereas in PS, what people do on each turn is likely combine and launch gems, giving the different decks a samey feel (apparently after enough playing, this goes away, but I don't feel like slogging through dull games to eventually maybe find fun play).

Harder to physically play, because a hand of cards is easier to hold onto than a hand of chips.

Longer play time, sometimes games can seem to go on forever, well before panic time is reached, due to the tug of war aspect of gem launching and the game lengthening effect of counter gem crashing.

Less engine building, because you have to do something about those gems accumulating, you don't get to really build something cool.

However, on the plus side, I think the individual chips for each personality are really nifty. I'd love to see something like that in Dominion.

I am a little disappointed in this game. I had hoped (and thought) that it would be the game which would replace Dominion and make me never look back, mainly because the interaction seemed to be much higher. Alas, after a handful of plays I sold the game and still think Dominion is the best deck building game (not that I’m a huge fanboy; I’ve only rated it a 7.5 iirc). Actually, in my gaming groups I was the most enthusiastic about Puzzle Strike; the others thought it was very “meh”. 

I’ve only tried it with 2 and 3 players, but to be honest I cannot see why it would be any better with 4, especially as you only attack one player at a time. It’s the same with Dominion which I also think works best with 2 or 3. However, unlike in Dominion where attacks hit every other player, in Puzzle Strike you choose a single opponent to attack – to me, this is a fatal flaw as it can lead to kingmaking (if playing with more than 2; which is also why I probably prefer playing Puzzle Strike with 2)! The rest of the attack phase is actually quite unique and interesting; I like that you attack with gems that you crash and split into many smaller pieces (though it does make the 4’s extremely important as they cannot be blocked, which I maybe think is too strong). So, while the attack phase of Puzzle Strike has some good things going on, I hate that you can only attack one opponent with your gems!

Unlike Dominion, you have unlimited buys as long as you have enough money which make you more flexible. It’s also pretty cool that you actually have to take a wound (= chip that does nothing but takes up space in your deck) if you cannot afford any other chips! Another change from Dominion is the actions; this was a very cool twist; I loved that different chips are color coded so that you can only play action chips in the corresponding colors. This meant that you had to think twice about the colors of the banners on the various chips!

One thing I don't like about PD is the very basic action chips; in Dominion, the cards have all sorts of effects, but in PD the text is down to a bare minimum and instead the chips only give you, for instance, an extra chip or two extra actions or allow you to keep a chip for the next round. So I really don't think the chips are particularly interesting!

Some final thoughts on some of the other things I liked about the game. The components are good as the chips are very sturdy. I loved the fact that I don’t constantly need to reshuffle! The unique player character chips is a brilliant move as it instantly changes your approach to the game each time, and you never start out with the same deck as your opponents. The way the game speeds up when you’re buying chips is a good idea, though it never happened in my games as the game ended faster than the stacks were emptied. In any case, the game still speeds up each turn because of the ante, and this is actually a good idea so you’re sure plays don’t overstay their welcome (yes, we’ve all had those games in Dominion with tons of attack cards where it’s impossible to buy anything because of all of your curses and ruins and no way to trash them)…

I don’t know anything about the theme, but it doesn’t matter as I’m not a sucker for theme. Now, all of the above maybe sounds like I love the game more than I should, but it never truly clicked for me, and my opponents hated it. My main gripe is that you must choose the opponent to attack, and yes, I know this can be “solved” by playing the game strictly as a 2p game, but I’ve tried that a couple of times and didn’t find the game that engaging when doing so.

Instantly fell in love with this.  I hate the attack cards in Dominion, and choose not to play with them.  The whole purpose of this game is to be attacking each other, which somehow makes it feel less nasty.  Panic time has lead to some hilarious moments.

Only reason it hasn't seen much play so far is because I have been trying to play all of my games, which is taking a while.  Once I'm done with that, I'm sure this will see a LOT of play.

RATING: 10
(Note: I have the 2nd edition & upgrade, with modded chips for all the 3rd edition changes). Are your other deck-builders getting predictable and/or boring? Try out this unique take on the genre - you may be pleasantly surprised. Strategies change every game not only due to a unique 'bank' (or kingdom, if you like) of 10 chips/card sets, but also because every player has three unique chips depending on which 'character' they choose. These allow you to do interesting stuff even in the first 2-3 turns.

That's only one half of the game, though - your objective is to knock out your opponents (or just one, in the new free-for-all rules) by filling up their gem pile. This gem pile slowly grows each turn, and the only way to trim it down is to use a crash gem chip to send them to another player. Your opponents can, however, counter most of these attacks with a crash gem of their own, therefore trimming both player's piles. In addition, the larger your gem pile, the more chips you can draw each turn, so you get a boost as you're about to lose (or the more you push your luck).

The icing on the cake is that the new free-for-all rules essentially get rid of player elimination, providing that everyone plays to win (second place is a loss, just the same as 3rd and 4th). When someone is 'knocked out' in these new rules, the game ends immediately and only the player with the *lowest* gem pile wins - everyone else loses. In addition, when someone is attacked by a crash gem, any other player can use their own crash gem to counter for them...which you may want to do if you don't have the lowest gem pile at present. So, when the current leader is trying to take town the player with the highest gem pile, there will always be two other players wanting to defend him (lest they lose the game as well). It works well in practice and avoids most of the usual problems with free-for-all games. You can, however, also play the game 2-vs-2.

I've played Puzzle Strike casually for a few years now, and I still find new tactics to try out. It adds a strongly interactive experience to the deckbuilding mechanic through the gem system, and as such, it's impossible to feel like you're playing a solo game.

The components are GREAT. Instead of shuffling the same small deck over and over again, you get to shake a bag of chips. It's very satisfying.

The characters are vastly improved from the original version, both flavor-wise and balance-wise. Although there are a few very strong characters, they can be beaten. Similarly, all of the puzzle chips (community cards in any deckbuilder) are strong enough to be usable given the right situation.

Wonderful gameplay, a fun theme and offering a ton of variation. The game may feel a bit slow at times but once you get a hang of everything and begin to recognize the different chips and can remember exactly what they do and how they can interact with each other to form deadly combos - then you'll REALLY start to quicken up the pace and can get an even more enjoyable experience!

A "deck builder" that uses cardboard chips instead of cards. Yay, no shuffling! 

After an initial play with my son, I think this is a great game to play with a young kids or with other adults when you want a lighter, 20 minute game. It's much better than Dominion, because as I said above, there's no shuffling, and also because there are no useless chips like the VP cards in Dominion. Also, each player has 3 unique "character" chips to use in his deck. This makes each player have a certain style of play, playing to the character's strengths. Player interaction is more consistent than in Dominion, as the object of the game is to "crash" gems to your opponents' gem piles. 

The production quality of this game is very impressive. The chips are very thick and feel great in your hand. The insert is custom for each category of chips, making set up and take down a breeze (although I recommend creating labels for the puzzle chips, as those are missing from the insert). The 3rd edition rebalances some of the chips based on tournament play. I like when designers acknowledge some imperfections in their games and work to correct them like this. 

This is the kind of game that you can play over and over, as the chips available (and characters) will be different every game.

Player Versus Player Deckbuilder

Pros:

Great quality cardboard poker chips. Functional iconography and text layout. Quality chip draw bags, privacy boards, player boards. The art is stellar on the box, instruction manual, boards, and chips with what little space there is. Instruction manual and game boards are helpful in teaching the game to newbies.

It is hard to judge gameplay balance without playing way more games but so far this game seems well balanced. Drawing chips and choosing what to buy is crucial. If you don't like engine building in deckbuilders and want more player direct conflict without any of the meanness, this game might fit the bill.

Lots of replayability.

Neutral: Works well even with the free-for-all 3-4 player mode. Best with 2 players.

Cons: Setup is not the quickest in terms of randomizing the 10 chip stacks. Lacks randomizers like card deckbuilders.

Take the core game play of Dominion, add variable player powers and direct conflict and you get one of the best 2 player games I've played in the last few months. There's a lot to discover and learn in Puzzle Strike. Each character plays different and in order to win, you should be aware of the game play that best suits your chosen character. There's a lot of interaction and some very interesting timing issues since you won't be able to play massive combos like in Dominion most of the time. The best move not only depends on what you have on hand but also on what your opponent is doing. Somehow, this game reminds of Blue Moon: While you'll have fun playing the first few games of Puzzle Strike, it will only get better the more you play it and discover it's intricacies.

Two thumbs up for this one and I'm really looking forward to my next plays.

Models a Puzzle Fighter match where gem piles are filling up the "screen" and you're trying not to get too many.  Crash your gems to send them to your opponent.  This is all wrapped up in a deckbuilding game modelled on Dominion, but you have characters with unique abilities in their starting decks.  The rules are a little more complex as a result, but asymmetrical gameplay and much more player interaction basically fixes every issue I had with Dominion.

The game is also extremely well balanced, with a hardcore tournament scene and a full strategy guide compiled by tournament players, despite only being a few years old.  Very fun, even if you're not an expert.  It strikes the balance between simple to get into but deep strategic complexity extremely well.  One of my favourite games.

Players are video game character battling each other in a last man standing battle. On your turn you add a gem to your pile, then play out your mini hand of five cards. At the end of your turn discard your hand and draw a new hand of five cards. The game is very heavily based on Dominion (acknowledged) but with three distinct differences. First, each player begins with three specific character cards in their deck, so everyone is different.  Second, there are no cards but instead played with poker chips with the information printed on them. Lastly, you are not collecting victory points, but instead trying to beat up your opponent by adding gems to their pile. You are knocked out of the game if you end a turn with 10 gems. Plays very clean and fast, and the poker chips make the shuffling much easier. A clean, fast Dominion - well done.  

The 3rd edition tweaks a few things to balance it out.  Basically, Combines are now -$1, and you can crash anybody at the table.

RATING: 9
Very cool combination deck builder and fighter (although you don't really fight...) game. Simple concept, especially if you've played Dominion or other deck builder, except for the gem concept: each turn, you receive an additional gem in your gem pile, which functions somewhat like hit points, but not really. You see, the point of the game is to make sure your opponent has 10 gems in his gem pile at the end of his turn. So, in order to do this, you'll combine gems into larger gems (gems come in 1, 2, 3 and 4 denomination), which you'll then smash into the other player's pile. This is the genius part of the game since it leads to tons of player interaction where you're trying to send the most gems on the other side without the other player stopping them by counter-smashing. Of course, you could wait a bit and build up a 4 gem, which can't be smashed back, but then you run the risk of having close to 10 gems (which is the limit, remember?) and lose before you're able to do so.
Add to this concept the fact that part of your original pile of chips (no cards here, chips act as cards) are three chips that define the fighter you play and you have a very fresh, challenging, high interaction game. 
Very fun and recommended.

The bag-building concept is always better than deck-building for me - pulling a random element out of a bag brings up the feelings that a build-your-own game should, whilst pulling the top card off a deck still feels the same as doing this with any old deck.

Far better than the first two editions.  Unfortunately this will probably be forever underrated due to Sirlin burning through a lot of the BGG community's good will with the rapid edition churn.

If you can get past that, then this is a superb deckbuilder. Funny theme, great components, and a huge number of strategies due to the asymmetric characters.  One of my favorite games.

Like Dominion, but a little less manageable, and with a push your luck element. Can't fathom the decision to use poker-chip-sized cardboard chits for all the gamepieces. Weird.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
What's good about it? Real choices in how you play the chips that you've drawn. I didn't really find a lot of angst in how to play your hand in Dominion (base) or Thunderstone (base). I really love the fact that each player starts with 3 unique chips for the 'character' he/she is playing. This can really define how you want to play the game and what chips you want to purchase. It also feels more interactive than the two previously mentioned titles as you will be piling gems on your opponent. When they hit 10 or more at the end of their turn, they lose. With the whole gem pile mechanism, there are no dead chips (like dominion VP cards, some monsters in TS) in your 'deck' unless your opponent puts wounds in your deck with chips. There is also a sense of escalation since the more chips that are in your opponents pile, the more chips they draw, giving them greater opportunity to counter.

What are the points of caution? (1) Most people consider this optimally a 2 player game. That may be a benefit or hindrance to some. Though, the multiplayer has changed in this edition... I haven't played multiplayer, so I can't comment (2) Based on the gem pile mechanism there is usually a high importance of purchasing/acquiring purple chips which interact with the gem piles. (3) Most other deck builders seem to be quicker at increasing their card variety with expansions. (4) My typical deck building issues and the chip thing. (5) This game has undergone many editions... first wood chips, then 2nd edition, then an upgrade pack, and then a new edition. This has been quite expensive for people that really like the game.

It's the gem pile management that kill my interest in the game. You have to manage your gem pile to be able to win. Crash Gems/Combines are the most straight-forward way to do this. So, the puzzle chips usually seem like unnecessary distractions unless they grant additional arrows. This is an over simplification and perhaps with an extreme devotion to the game to learn it's subtlety the players would use a variety of chip types, but I'm not willing to devote that much time to this game.

The iOS or Steam implementation is a cheap way of finding out whether this is a game you have interest in.

RATING: 10
Hands down the best and most balanced competitive deck-building game I've played. Obviously a bit random, given that it's a card game... but the inclusion of a static bank throughout the game, as well as a system based around direct interaction between opponents, rather than the more passive systems of some where players are simply left to their devices to fashion a deck built towards a single purpose, makes for a stimulating and engaging game that will challenge anyone's deck-building capabilities.

A must for any deck-building fan.

RATING: 6
Neat characters. Still not a big fan of the Dominion-style setup with everyone buying abilities from multiple copies of the same pool of options. However, the PvP nature keeps it pretty engaging. Unfortunately, I'm finding it difficult to form any meaningful strategies with this game. Turning blocks into attacks to fill up my opponents bar seemed interesting (I like Tetris, Dr. Mario, Puzzle Quest, etc) but I feel like the "deck-building" aspect that drives the game isn't working too well here.

Pros
-Cool spin on the now tried and true deck building genre
-Use of chips to avoid needing to continuously shuffle your deck
-Faster pace and directly competitive (you send chips to other opponents as attacks, and they lose if they end their turn with more than x amount)
-Players can choose which character they want to be (persistent world from Flash Duel and Yomi, bonus if you like/know of those games)

Cons
-Kingmaking in some situations (???)

The game really should get more love.  It has so much more depth than Dominion, Ascension, Thunderstone, Legendary:Marvel, DC Comics if players can just look past the theme and using chips instead of cards.

RATING: 6
A deck-building game featuring some sort of direct conflict. I'm not a big fan of the genre in general, but Puzzle Strike makes it a little more palatable by adding the constant strain of having to keep your gem pile under control and thus putting a natural limit on the ability to wire up your engine. The different character abilities are a nice touch.

The multiplayer game works although it does have a few warts and this is most likely a two-player only (or tag team) title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
If I had to pick a favorite game ever, it would be this one.

I've always enjoyed the concept of deck-building games, but Dominion and other popular titles in the genre have never really been able to hold my interest. There are lots of cool ideas being thrown around, but nobody seems to get it quite right.

This one is so close to perfect that I can't imagine myself ever wanting to play Dominion or Thunderstone again. I understand these games have a lot of fans and I would hate to offend said fans, but really... In terms of raw depth no other deckbuilder compares.

The are many subtle differences, but the main reason is the unique victory condition. It's not simply a race to see who can acquire the most points, but a deeply involved sort of tug of war. If you let up on the rope for a moment, you can focus on other things and come back to the rope with an advantage. If you aren't careful, though, your opponent might just pull you over the edge while you're slacking.

It's absolutely brilliant and I truly can't recommend it enough.

Combines the deck engine mechanic that works well in Dominion with the direct player interaction of crashing your puzzzle chips at your opponent. Best as a 2 player and better than Dominion at this player count but unfortunbately does not work as well with more players. I have the card version as I find the chips cumbersome.

An improvement on the "100% tested and balanced" but unfortuantely quite flawed first edition - at least now the puzzle chips are somewhat relevant to play although the crash chips still dominate.

A great twist on deck building, one of my favourites. The risk/reward that comes from having many gems is both a good comeback mechanic and an interesting strategy. I like that it's confrontational by design, that makes it the "deck" builder with the most player interaction that I've played.

An absolutely stunning amount of replayability and all the options are good. There's very little build-up time before you've got a powerful deck. Then the gems start flying back and forth... (hmmm, let's see you get out of THAT one!). Gets very tense.

Theme is light to non-existant, but true to it's claim - a simulation of a fighting game that simulates a puzzle game.

Drawing chips is WAY better, and more fun, than shuffling cards. Quite impressed overall.

RATING: 7
While deck-building is not my favorite mechanic, this is my favorite iteration of it -- the Player vs. Player agression makes the game more than an engine builder (or at least, if you engine build, it is at your own risk; and it becomes your opponent's responsibility to shut it down or build faster). The decisions are meaningful while still being a fast and furious game of taking swings at your opponent.

My rating for this game forever vacillates between 7 and 8. Here we are on the upswing again. This is one of the best, if not the best, deck-builders out there. My rating usually fluctuates depending on how I feel about deck-building in general!

Plays best with 2, which is good and bad I suppose.  Setup is more fiddly than similar games like Dominion and Trains, but the gem concept certainly makes it play out differently.  I'm still a novice, and always will be, but it seems that Combine gems are simply too useful, and in each game I've seen thus far, players struggle to put together stronger gems and have a dearth of 1s in their gem pool.  Some character abilities seem too utility-esque and not useful enough, but maybe more time will tell with this one.

More than a few things to like here.  The selection of puzzle discs are generally solid; or at least the style of actions appeal to me.

I like the stressor of the Gem Pile.  I actually did play Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo back in the day, so the theme does it for me.

But my favorite bit is the 3-chip characters that you seed your deck with.  They have just enough effect to force you to adapt to them and keep each play fresh.

Fixes most things I don't like(minimal interaction/irrelevant theme/snowball effect/pseudo-cooperative nature) about deck-building games except the inherent randomness of drawing from a bag of chips or a deck of cards.

Most deck builders are too beholden to strategic probability, which I'm not interested in exploring 99% of the time

More interactive than Dominion, and has more variety from game to game with a smaller pool of chips(cards) due to the asymmetrical characters.

Because I don't play video games, it took me awhile to get the "puzzle fighter" theme ("why in the world is it bad if I give my opponent gems?"). For what it’s worth:  I don't like Dominion (too much like solitaire and dry); but I do like Puzzle Strike. It has the typical Sirlin interactive, aggressive, fast-pace, combos, and asymmetrical characters. Every move counts, and things come down to the wire.  Wins are by a hair, and you're sure you're going to win just before you lose. There's fun push-your-luck where you need to come close to losing (10 gems) to be able to draw enough cards to win.  Lots of variety: each game you pick 2 of  10 characters and a bank of 10 of 24 combo pieces, and they really do feel different. Pain to set up and put away--main negative. Reminded me a bit of Summoner Wars in complexity and feel, but shorter. Serlin is one of my favorite designers, which is odd considering I don't play video games.

Puzzle Strike adapts most of the deckbuilding principles from Dominion but moves the win condition out of the "deck", instead having life meters that are manipulated using various effects and give feedback by determining the number of "cards" drawn.

It is still a good game though, with a lot of potential, but unfortunately it did not see much play yet.

What a game. At first I was skeptical about the chips and the shuffle bags + screens, but in practice it actually works and I even consider it to be more convenient than the good old hand shuffling in other deck building games.

The game is designed with competitive play in mind, as like other Sirlin's games, so the rules are clean and everything is addressed. 

Because of its mechanics, the game is the most interactive deck building game I have ever played. The tactical timing to act and react to your opponent is what sets it apart from other deck building games, since in other games it can feel like you just stick to your strategy and let the luck of the draw decide your fate.  The asymmetry keeps the game fresh and opens up opportunity for interesting metagame.  

But what sells me this game is the mechanic that the designer used to solve the king making problem in multiplayer (3+ players) games. The mechanic makes it impossible to gang up on one player as well as eliminate player elimination. Genius.

Also the game can be played online on fantasystrike.com. BEWARE: IT'S ADDICTIVE.

Also own Shadows expansion and the promo chips.

Strike is a card game played with cardboard chips instead of cards that simulates a puzzle video game such as Puzzle Fighter or Tetris.

It's a deckbuilding game, which means you build your deck *as* you play the game. Every game is different because the bank starts with a different set of chips each time. Also, there are 10 characters to choose from in the base set, each with different gameplay. Between all that, there are over 411 MILLION starting conditions in a 4-player game, and even more if you include the expansion.

I *love* adding heroes (and more interaction!) to Dominion, but the games I played tended to drag on and on in tedium, not to mention eliminated players losing interest. The poker chips, bag, mats, and shields also made setting up the game and field a chore - and the novelty of the chips themselves wears off very fast when you experience how difficult it is to draw, handle, and sort through a hand of 8 chips.

Brings improvements to the genre, but ultimately a flawed execution.

Überraschend gutes Spiel. Anfangs war ich doch skeptisch, da viele geschrieben haben: "Wie alle anderen Deckbuilder"!
Aber die Angriffe haben echt Spaß gemacht. Was tatsächlich doof ist, sind die Chips... keine Grafik drauf (man hätte sooo schöne Manga-stil Bilder auf Karten drucken können, aber dann wäre es nicht "innovativ" mit Chips.) Die Chips haben beim Angriff Spaß gemacht, da man die so vor den Gegner "pfeffern" konnte. Im Beutel und""auf der Hand" waren sie unübersichtlich.

Low-sodium Dominion + Street Fighter = win. I like this game for saying it's fast and meaning it, and for actually having a little bit of a new twist on the standard deck-building game - both the more gimmicky twist of the chips instead of cards, and the actual system twist of having characters with unique chips that only go with them. My only complaint is that I do feel like your strategy has to hit the ground running; the length of a single game is such that buying a chip you don't wind up using can significantly impact you. That said, the game plays so fast that it's fairly easy to just start a new game and try a different strategy, so the criticism is a fairly mild one.

RATING: N/A
Deckbuilding mechanics, but using chips in a bag - so, like Quarriors, except for much better because of not having that extra randomness.  Plus, doing well and crashing gems into your opponents actually give them more tools to get you back, so the game auto-balances a little more.  Designed by David Sirlin, and the 3rd edition has even more balancing from tournaments, so the game is so very well done, like all of his stuff.  Additionally, (and again like the other two Fantasy Strike games) each character plays completely different.

Unfortunately, just hasn't hit it off with me or my group.  Definitely seems like it's best as a two-player dueling game, and may be one of the best for developing a strategy based the the board and your individual character and your opponent's character.  Sad thing is, in the end I just didn't find it fun, even with all the variety of match-ups.  I'd rather just play either Dominion or Yomi or Netrunner.

Traded on here for Arctic Scavengers.

Different from other deckbuilders like Dominion and Ascension in that your gem pile is a constant reminder how you and your opponents are doing. It's also confrontational. The "crashing" mechanic is unique and makes the game tense with lots of swings from doing well to almost losing.

RATING: 6
Played this online a few times. Not my type of game. I'm not very good in deckbuilding, at least not to make the best deck possible for that game. I really like to try out all the chips and what they do: there isn't much room for that. In comparison with Dominion: puzzle strike is more thematic to me (I like the Fantasy strike Universe) and there's a lot more interaction (crashing gems), that's where the 0.5 comes from.

RATING: 8
I avoided this for the longest time, raging pink box and super deformed characters in a fighting game. I just thought 'ick'. I was so wrong. I love this as much as I hate Dominion. Its interactive, and rather than just trying to build the best engine, you have to build the best engine to counter what your opponent is doing offensively and defensively. And each opponent will be different, as the characters have different powers, players will have different styles, and the chips available may be different. It is a ton of fun.

RATING: 6
After 31 plays. Rating as a 2-player game only. I love games which successfully fix and perfect earlier games. Here, Dominion is the starting point and this is the result. I don't like Dominion, but Puzzle Strike has won me over somewhat by changing everything I don't like. So even though deckbuilders aren't generally my thing, this one gets my respect (6 is actually a little above average for my ratings - I grade on a curve). 

I haven't played enough to really explore the depths however, and this one certainly has depths to be explored, so my score could shoot up with experience

The thing that annoys me most is that, as with most deck-builders, it's fiddly (even though thanks to the chip format it's less fiddly than most other deck builders)

Otherwise, I love the components: the clean, colorful graphic design, the feel of the chips, player boards, and screens, the incredibly good box insert, the giant pink box. Really well done.

I liked the unique take on deck-building wherein you're trying to eliminate other players. It plays fast, you don't need to shuffle and it's combolicious.

The Best deck building game out there.  If you're looking at Dominion or Ascension, Puzzle Strike is better.  It's more dynamic and has deeper game play.

Cons:
*The learning curve on this is relatively steep.  While the rules are simple in play and practice, they are short and concise, new players are going to have questions.
*MoIBPS (Millions of Itty-Bitty Pieces Syndrome); this is tempered by one of the best designed storage boxes ever.

P.S. The online version available for the Free-model on Fantasystrike.net is the reason why I don't play League of Legends or any other computer game anymore.  I play games on the website daily.

Fantastic game whose initial plays play out quickly and lightly.  Only gradually, however, does the immense depth of this begin to come to the surface.  Played against a player of equal ability this is something to savour, and it really does feel like a fight with move, countermove and finishing blow.  There is more in the basic box for many, many plays, and with Shadows it presents the potential for years of exploration.

Current rating represents my meagre knowledge of this game, but this is likely to go up rather than down.

RATING: 3
I hoped for some interesting asymmetic matchup deckbuilder with intricacies and tempo-based gameplay. But combining and crashing gems feels terribly video-gamey and is mainly here to remind us that Puzzle Strike wants to be to Yomi what Puzzle Fighter is to Street Fighter, rather than being satisfying per se.

Then the "more in trouble => more options" is a bit too obvious as a catchup mechanism and is perhaps a symptom of the core game design being prone to snowballing. You'll be unfortunately left with that "perhaps", because the short time I spent with the game only left me wondering why I was not playing Dominion instead, so I'm not really willing to investigate further.

On the plus side, shuffling chips in a bag every other turn is way nicer than the same with cards. Too bad the chips and their graphical design are an uncredited rip-off of Matthan Heiselt's Dominion reskin.

The player mats & shields are really a basic necessity. If you have the 2nd edition, just print some out from BGG here.

Also scales very well, and restricts amount of time "killed" players have to wait around nicely.

Quick, fun, addictive!

The game plays like Super Puzzle Fighter meets Dominion, and it's important to note that I didn't care much for Dominion, since I prefer deckbuilders with some sort of thematical sense.

Every match is enjoyable and prone to very tense moments.  

Each character has a definite style and begs you to figure out how to best play him/her/it.

My girlfriend likes it a lot too and so does my nephew, so this will become one of our most played games for sure.  

I also bought the Shadows expansion immediately after playing the first two (back-to-back) free-for-all games.

Oh yeah, it plays just as well with 2-players than with 3 or 4 (it just tends to be more tense with 2).

I Kickstarted this and was really looking forward to it.  I enjoyed a previous edition so figured I would go for this one.

Theme is nice and the component quality is excellent.  Bags of chips stop shuffling downtime.

The asymmetrical design is interesting. I think perhaps like the Street Fighter video games it would benefit from more time being sunk in.

Groups get the rules wrong.  One group was playing it wrong in one way, another in a different subtle way.  Gem size taking take up space as well as weight caught us out once.

I can't put my finger on what stops me rating this higher.  It just doesn't come out as much as other games.

Quality gameplay and production. Neat take on "deck-building" with the gem pile and crashing. Learning curve. The asymmetrical characters' chips are not always intuitive. Replayability due to combinations. Does not come with randomizers.

I'd rather play Trains and Star Realms as a 2 player more than this.

The theme turned me away from this game at first but what a mistake this was - the game packs a punch. Quirky, for sure, but fantastic strategic game. Still not a huge fan of the theme, which gets in the way of what you're doing (what are these gems? how are they related to punching and kicking? I get that there was Puzzle Fighter before that but that doesn't make much sense to me either) but the game is really fun, challenging and unique.

This game is pure awesomeness. Far superior base game to any other deckbuilder. Having a unique character really changes the game each time in addition to the chips you can buy. Can't wait to play this more and figure out which character I like best. Only 1-2 have stood out to me so far.

Edit: Received my replacement character chips for the miscut sheet. They are much better than the ones that were in the box. I didn't think about this at the time, but it will now allow for mirror matches as a possibility. I think once those other chips get worn down a bit, it should be less distinguishable in the bag.

A very fun "deck" building game. Instead of cards, this game uses "poker chip" style chits as cards. In this game you build your deck with powers and abilities to defeat your opponents, via sending gems to their board. It really gives you a feel of playing the video game of puzzle fighter. There are tons of characters to choose from, and each character has 2 special abilities unique to them. I really enjoy this game because of the theme and the different strategy you can use, depending on your character and how you want to build your deck.

Deck-building done horribly wrong. Very unbalanced characters, apparently quite little balancing for the actions and their prices, a number of idiotic properties that both slow down the game play (actions that constantly require browsing through the bag or discard) and unnecessarily increase the luck component or add bad forms of direct interaction. On top of that, the components themselves make the game slower compared to using cards for the same purpose. Finally, with more than 2 players the game is all about kingmaking.

This is it. This is that game that almost reaches perfection. This is a game that appeals to both light and veteran gamers. It's awesome.

There's a ton of depth to this game. There's a system of what to buy in order to get ahead of your opponent. There are 10 characters that get their own unique chips. Gameplay is easy to do, yet rewards good play. On your turn, you merely ante a gem, play an action chip, buy something, then cleanup. The strategy in the game comes from buying the correct things.

The game is also fast, so it won't take many hours to play like some other games. It fits a nice size of 4 and plays good at this size as well.

This is my top choice for a multiplayer combative game. The combination of it being easy to learn, fast to play, strategically clear and interesting to both good and new players makes it absolutely playable and worthwhile in anyone's collection. It's definitely not a game that will be sitting around and collecting dust.

As for the expansion... well, I'm going to master the base game first before I go over there. I prefer the game using chips as I don't want to sleeve more cards and also shuffling is done better with the bags.

After playing this a while, I still think it's a good game, but there are some unnecessary rules that bog the game down more than it should. The bracket system is one of the most obvious. People often forget about it and I have to remind them and it's annoying. I wish it could just be 5 to be elegant. People also forget to ante as well and I have to remind them. The crash system is also a pain because you have to say things such as crash shoot a single "chip" at an opponent, then it breaks up into "1s" and that "4s" are unblockable. It's a good game, but these little rules make it less elegant than it could be.

A versus mode deckbuilder with real interaction set against the ticking clock of the gem pile, with so many good tactical and strategic concerns and such variety that it has wiped any other competitive deck builder from the table. Simple enough mechanics but deep enough that it really could be played to "tournament" level of play.

Most games, though, end when your deck doesn't spit out the chip you need the turn you need it, which is unsatisfying but does mean the opponent does not even have to bother playing their last turn when you make that draw.

RATING: 9.5
If you want a deeply competitive deck building game with a ton of interaction, strategy, and variety, look no further. The victory conditions are more satisfying than games like Dominion, as you are directly attacking the other players. Anteing gems into the gem pile works well as a mechanism to push the game towards its conclusion. The strategic decisions are interesting, deep, and intense. It can take several plays before you have a decent sense of what the strategic considerations are, much less how to deal with them well. With 20 different characters that actually play quite differently in addition to the variability of the bank, this game is infinitely replayable. 

----------

Over 100 games in, and I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. This game has a tremendous amount of depth. It lives up to the goal of being the best deck builder to play at a highly competitive level. Conversely, it is not a casual friendly game. There is a learning cliff, and playing against players that are much weaker than you is going to get boring.

Deckbuilders out there tend to try and differentiate by offering a board, altering the rules in insignificant ways and/or clunking the game up with keyword overload or ported mechanisms from other card games. Puzzle Strike is a true 'deckbuilder with a twist' thanks to the gem pile, which is simultaneously resource and game-ender, and provides a unique 'tear-down' victory objective. The result is a true game where deckbuilding is a means to an end, instead of an ugly undressed mechanism.

Everything else screams of refinement of all the positive qualities of deckbuilding: chips instead of cards (shamelessly copied from a fan image, and it'd be nice to give credit, also shamelessly copied [filepage=63446]this[/filepage]), 5 chips instead of 10 (so the drafting is more important), Panic Time sudden death to stop games from outstaying their welcome, and of course,a roster full of characters with their own style.

This is a fun game, not a mechanical exercise that befits Dominion and so many Knizia 'archtypes'. I do not feel like I am 'deckbuilding' during the game, and that's the highest compliment you can give to a deckbuilder.

The thing that stops me playing more is the setup and the huge amount of pre-game reading of the 10 'kingdom cards'.

4+4

"Deck" Building game but with chips in a bag. One of our chip sheets wasn't punched correctly which led to some tearing upon punching out which is just disappointing. The "puzzle" part of it doesn't seem super well integrated. I whether they came up with the idea of a dominion clone first and then slapped a theme on or whether they were fans of puzzle fighter first and tried to develop a board game around that.

This is 100% a dominion clone.  The gimmick of being on poker chips does not help it at all and the individual powers per character are not enough to salvage the game.  The chips have smaller text than Dominion as we'll and there does not feel to be the variety of Dominion in the box.  The game just doesn't improve on what it is based off.

From a pure gameplay standpoint, this is one of the easiest 10/10s I've ever given, especially when combined with the Shadows expansion. Its design is subtle brilliance, and I think it's easy to cast this game to the side as yet another deck-building wannabe, but I think anyone who gives it a chance will find more than they expected in the gameplay -- it was designed for repeat plays over being flash in the pan.

After extensive play from the time the second edition was first released, this has ended up as my favorite "deck building" game, though in feel it actually shares little in common with the typical "VP race" found in Dominion and its children, which is surprising considering the similar ruleset -- to me it instead feels more like a direct-conflict game where you invest in Economy (gems), Technology (Puzzle Chips) and Army (Purple chips) to try and kill your opponent. Think Starcraft (the computer game).

You must consider your opponent and adapt. Not only his character, but his playstyle. If you do not, and he uses an aggressive strategy, you will die. This isn't simply a game of buying the most expensive or most efficient stuff you can on your turn and then watching fireworks happen. You're preparing for an actual conflict here, and it's happening from turn 1 thanks to the character chips.

Gameplay is highlighted by key super tense moments. When you are on the brink of death, you are at your most powerful. How close to the edge can you get without falling off? The player who can answer this question is often the victor (just as in the game's video-arcade source of inspiration, Puzzle Fighter)

[b]Improvements to 2nd Edition:[/b] This is a superb update to the Second Edition + Upgrade Pack, which I already rated a 10. The newly strengthened puzzle chips are just oh so much fun and the -$1 Combine adds some welcome complexity to purple management.

It's just a shame that there's no upgrade path for 2nd edition owners who recently bought the 2nd Edition Upgrade Pack... but Puzzle Strike is a game that you can play thousands of times if you have some good willing opponents, so even with the updates there's more than enough time to get your money's worth. 

New adopters, on the other hand, who are less jaded by the rapid-fire updates, are in for a real treat, if they have opponents who are willing to explore the game with them

[b]2 player:[/b] This is one of my favorite 2 player games!
[b]3-4 player:[/b] The new FFA mode is absolutely genius. It seems to be a marked improvement on the original. Changes gameplay quite a bit, to the point where new Puzzle Strike is kinda two games in one. At the very least, this mode is extremely interesting and UNIQUE. No other game like it.

[b]Components[/b]: Like most deck-builders, setup can be cumbersome. Shuffling in a bag probably beats shuffling a deck of cards, but you still must make a genuine effort for it to be done effectively (shake hard, and mix around with hand before drawing) due to the cardboard chips having a tendency to clump.

It's a fun deck building where you can't mess around, you need to build up your engine and all that, but ultimately you want to take out people as quickly as possible.  As long as everyone knows what they are in for, then it can be fun.  

Even the third edition rules are difficult, which seems so crazy considering how easy the game is to play.

This rating may go up with more plays. It definitely is like Dominion, but with some nice improvements that force you to do player interaction, as rather than collecting victory points, you're forcing your opponents hand by sending them negative points via the gems. With everyone also starting with a different starting hand (due to the characters), this also creates some nice variety in forcing people to use different strategies.

Mediocre deck-builder that was a bit disappointing since the theme seemed pretty awesome and unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Deck-builder that's asymmetric, with direct conflict and real tension. Whereas Dominion gets its replayability from using a different set of cards every time, Puzzle Strike gets it from player interaction. As a result, with its many expansions, Dominion may have more game-to-game variety, but it's also bulkier and more expensive. Within a match, however, Puzzle Strike is much deeper, with much more tactical depth; playing on auto-pilot is the surest way to lose. Yet it doesn't devolve into a purely tactical game. Despite the mechanical similarities, Dominion is totally different. More than anything, Puzzle Strike feels like Puzzle Fighter, just as Yomi feels like Street Fighter. I've played a thousand matches online. No exaggerating.

Some characters are better than others, but not as much as you'd think; even the strongest can be taken down by the weakest in the right circumstances. You'll have your favourite characters to match your playstyle, but those characters and that playstyle won't always be the best, and that's part of what I admire in the design. Nothing in this world is perfect, and Puzzle Strike is no exception, but I could play forever even so.

Puzzle Strike Shadows was the first version of Puzzle Strike I played.  The rules for that game which can be played standalone are the same as here, just different chips and characters.  So my comments on that game can be mirrored here though I like having a lot more options for what is essentially a deck building (but with poker chips instead of cards) game.

Brings a nice back and forth element to deck building.  The closer you get to losing the harder you get to beat.  I really liked that mechanic.  The rest of the game is kind of run of the mill deck building, but it has a definite charm to it (and REALLY nice components to boot)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is still rather unique in the pool building style of games. It has direct player interaction without the double luck of Quarriors. There is still something that just hasn't grabbed me though. I think it may be the chip actions. Other than the fact that the chips are bland to look at and you loos that physicality of holding them like cards, the interactions are so varied and, in many cases, complicated that they just don't seem to click with me. The chips don't interact with each other as I would like. They feel more like dominion where it is more about getting additional draws and actions from individual cards instead of the way the pool works as a whole the way it feels in Thunderstone, Eminent Domain, Core Worlds or Rune Age.
I believe I may like the game more if I played it enough to learn the chip interactions better but there is not enough grabbing me to want it in my collection at this time.

This is the perfect deckbuilding game. It combines this already fun genre with direct player interaction, asymmetrical starting conditions and lots of tactical depths. Despite the name (which was chosen because of the theme), it is not a "puzzle", but a battle of wits from the very first turn until the very last one.

It works great as a competitive 2-player game, but it is also lots of fun for 3 and 4 players. The free-for-all multiplayer mode is very dynamic while avoiding all the usual problems that can plague multiplayer games with direct attacks.

One of my all-time favorite games. Takes the deckbuilding idea and really improves upon it with asymmetric starting powers, no dead cards (chips in this game), and has a great theme. Plus tons of player interaction and a super fun FFA mode for 3 or 4 players that makes it play like a party game.

The second edition was already great, but with some minor improvements the third edition is the definitive one to own.

This is a very interesting take on deck-building games. Sure, many of the chips you buy are the same as many other games, but each game truly feels unique so far. I love the asymmetry when it comes to choosing a character and how it affects how you play your game. This is my favorite competitive deck-builder, especially since I don't have to try to score as many VP as I can.

I can see why it has a high rating as it is very good and very varied. However it does seem like just another deck-builder albeit with nuances.
A good friend taught it me and he and his crowd love it, so I think I was hot and jaded on the day! Or maybe it's because the theme doesn't resonate as I've never played the 8-bit game it's modelled on..

Puzzle Strike is frustrating in its unnatural turn flow.  The promise of an ultimate deck-building game is enticing because the tokens are so easy to handle.  But unlike Dominion and its countless imitators, a player's turn never develops a smooth rhythm and Puzzle Strike stutters along.

One of the few games my wife will play. I enjoyed the mechanics of Dominion but needed something more confrontational, with a similarly short play time. This game fits those requirements perfectly.

Probably would have rated this game better when it came out, as recent deck- and poolbuilding games have taken a bit of the novelty out of it. Still a well designed game that is similar to Dominion, but then with direct conflict between the players, which actually makes for a nice dynamic feel. Love the setting and artwork, as well as the quality of the components. Some of the characters that you can play, however, are infinitely more interesting than others in the way they play out.

Starting to get my head around this. It's very interesting but sometimes the character/pool selection seems to drown out everything else. Also feels a bit unsatisfying when there's no forks available.

Edit: Asymmetry demands that players choose their characters after inspecting the bank, which means both players really need to know the game well just to start playing. Far less interested in this design paradigm as time goes by.

Sirlin's strange description of "card game that simulates a puzzle game that simulates a fighting game" is actually spot on. This is a really cool deckbuilder where players are encouraged to take big risks and make big plays. After a few turns you always feel like you're on the bleeding edge as you create huge gems, which put you closer to losing, until you send those gems over to the opponent.

The addition of characters with their own unique chips make this game asynchronous, which helps to avoid games where both players are rushing the same strategy (something that happens often in Dominion). Love this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The painful-Chibi art and bright pink box aside, I really enjoy this game.  It's probably my favorite "deck builder" as that mechanism gets boring really fast for me normally.  This game moves along and feels directly competitive from start to finish.  The theme is pretty abstract, but you can play it up a bit in a goofy way.  Enjoyable game with nice components.

It gets rated extra highly just because the game is so easy to pick up and get rolling.  It's very fast paced where people are just knocking out turns right after the other.  There's lots of variability through the random chips and especially the characters.  The character chips really are what make it special, each one giving you a different feel.

Great deck-builder. Beats Dominion and sits up there with Trains and Thunderstone.

First of all this is an excellent game. Easy to learn but hard to master. The optimal strategy is way harder to find than in rival games and you must adapt to new opponents due to their playstyle and direct interaction.

Secondly; There is direct interaction that feels like an integral part of the game! Not like those games where you just build a snowball and then whoop your opponent out in one strike, well this is a bit like that but it doesn't feel like that in the negative way.

Thirdly; Chips handle better than cards but the game would work with cards and still be the best.

Finally; No way to sleeve chips == profit!

The subtler changes are hard to address, but the major changes -- eliminating player elimination and allowing players to hit anyone in the game instead of just the players to their left -- aren't much of an improvement for me.  I preferred the last-person-standing rules, and find that the "attack the losing player to force a win" characteristic of the game is a lot less interesting.  Plus, I thought that the use of other players as shields, since you could only attack the player to your left, made for an interesting dynamic.  What was once a fast, furious game of attacks and elimination is now a slow, drawn-out spectacle of "Does anyone else wish to respond?"  It's a good thing I can still play by the older rules with the newer chips, but now everyone wants to play the new way.

I thought this was a game my wife would like.  I looked into it… I read some reviews and watched some play throughs.  I decided that it probably was not going to be a game that I would enjoy.  But, we made the purchase anyway for her.  In the small handful of times that we have played, I have actually really enjoyed it.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I believe this is a game that could work for hard core, tactical players or for casual play and fun for the whole family.  And the box is pink!

What is this game doing among the 600 best games ever??
I didnt like it, most of all because it is so similar to dominion that even the few truly original mechanics pale when put side by side with all the things stolen from dominion. Components (and the box most of all) are good but the chips have very tiny writings on them that make them difficult to be read. after a long while the game flows better but still, it's dominion all over again with the only big difference that you want to lose points. i can give it another try if there's nothing better around to waste time.

A novel take on the deck building game. The chips are good quality and each character has a different feel to them. I wasn't necessarily blown away by it but I feel, like Yomi, this type of "character game" demands many more plays. It's another deck builder. Quick and a pretty easy flow to understand. I feel like this might be a better 2-player game than with 3-4. It felt a bit weird choosing which opponent to attack, since attacking one helps the other indirectly.

The changes definitely seem to be improvements, as intended.  It's easy to muddle through this, and casually appreciate some of the self-balancing mechanisms in the game, without it really clicking for you.  Thanks to the ante, the game will end.  There is so much right about this game.  One of the [conceptually] simplest improvements* that [thing=67928][/thing] brings to the genre is having each player play a different character.  It means that you can leave the entire setup identical, except for three character chips per player, and still play a strategically different game every time.

[size=7]* As with software, the simplest change for the user often requires the most work under the hood.  The amount of effort put into design, development, and testing the very asymmetrical characters is probably obscene.[/size]

Asymmetric gameplay comes out on top again! This game is fantastic. The initial learning curve is a little more than other Sirlin Games, but the depth is comparable. 

The cardboard chips have taken a little getting used to, but I think in the long run I will enjoy their durability compared to cards.

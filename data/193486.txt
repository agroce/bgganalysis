Great and seemingly very balanced game. I have won (and lost) with most of the possible strategies, and I enjoy trying out new things.
Plays fast, but with lots of interesting choices along the way.

Only issue is, it is a bit difficult to teach, as each card has so many uses depending on which phase you are in. That is the only hurdle.

A surprisingly tight and engaging mix of worker placement and hand management. The multi-use cards offer interesting decisions, especially the villager cards, which represent your workers, but can also be retired and become end-game scoring. My only concern is that the low number of cards won't allow for huge replayability. I'm just guessing, though, and as I said, the game is very tight, which I'm sure it wouldn't be with more cards. As it stands there are multiple possible strategies to pursue, and in a handful of plays I haven't noticed any that are clearly dominant.

This was a fun 2 player card game. Players have villager cards to place out and take actions and then can also play a variety of cards from their hand. The game is about collecting icons to play point cards and also playing their villager cards for end game points. I liked the asynchronous timing between the players and the "blocking" that is possible. The art is poor in my opinion but the gameplay was fun. I'm not 100% sure about long term replayability, but there is an expansion. Overall seems like a solid 20-30 min 2 player card game along the lines of San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, Mottainai, Oh My Goods, etc.

Clever little filler, with a surprising amount of theme. Like it :)

** Update
Surprising level of depth given the low card count - not sure it is something I'll play over and over and over vs the same opponent (unlike say Race for the Galaxy), but it's early days. Has a much smaller footprint and learning curve in it's favour.

This game was just messy. While it works I suppose, it quickly grinds into a sloppy game of just matching icons. It tends to run itself, often leaving you with little options when acquiring cards, and when you have a choice it just boils down to playing the card that scores best with the cards you had no choice in playing.

+ The game is pretty fun.  I wouldn't play it more than a couple times, but it was decent.
- There are a lot of similar games out there.
- The graphic design choices are a little puzzling.  Some of the text and icons are hard to read on the fly and the color scheme is a bit drab.

I don't think it will replace Omen as my favourite Small Box game but for now it's a very close second.
Very simple rules but such a satisfying game. 
Love the multi-use cards, worker placement aspect and the binary turn structure. 
Great theme too. Shame the graphic design isn't slightly more appealing but on the plus side it's very functional.

After a few plays, I am really enjoying this as a "micro-civ".  I expect it will eventually get repetitive, but I'm not there yet, and I still haven't played with the expansion cards! This rides with my games for when 2 of us need a short game while waiting for a larger group game to end.  The expansion also provides goal cards for a solitaire game, which is decent for learning the game but not at all challenging once you get it.

I liked most of the mechanical groove, but by the end we had both gotten to do more or less all the things we wanted to, and the apparent tension was most of what I liked, so in retrospect it seems like I was supposed to be playing a drafting/card selection game instead of an action efficiency game. Haven't been moved to play again yet.

A nice little game of multi-use cards, with a fun caveman theme. Mechanically, you're mostly looking at your hand of cards and trying to decide which courses of action will get you the most points, but it's done well enough.

RATING: 8
Really fun game. It's pretty simple but I did feel like I had a good amount of decisions to make in a very short play time. There is definitely some luck in seeing cards with symbols that work well together, but it's definitely mitigatable, and for a game this quick it's well within reasonable luck levels. The most interesting thing is probably in timing your pickups/resets, but there's also an aspect of proper card use since every card has two uses. And the special powers you can get from domesticated animals can be key to success.

The game is a bit of a turn off when you first look at it. The art is nothing special. The card backs are cluttered with text reminding players how to draft them. Each card is dual-use, so cards have pictures and text going in two directions. However, once you get past that first impression, you'll find a fun two-player drafting game with a considerable decision space.

Players are ancient tribes developing nascent cultures through hunting, gathering, procreating and innovating. Each of these aspects are represented by a different deck of cards. Those four decks, plus a fifth deck, "Forage", which is a mix of the other four, are shuffled and placed between the players. Players play their villager cards next to a deck in order to draw some cards and then immediately play or keep some in hand - the rules for which are a little different for each deck. Instead of playing a villager, players can take their villagers back and play an equal number of cards to their village, which is a tableau players build throughout the game. Cards in your village give you icons which act as requirements for other cards and/or points at the end of the game. Balancing what you draft with what's in your hand and what's in your village is what the game is about. They way in which villagers are retrieved and how that is tied to developing your tableau creates opportunities for some pretty crafty play. This game plays bigger than a small deck card game has any right to play. And that's a cool thing!

I love games with a sense of elegance and good decision making. Neolithic combines these two elements in a 30-45 minute game. I play the game exclusively with the advance cultures expansion. Without the expansion the game could grow to be samey. The expansion adds variability. I find the puzzle satisfying. The interaction between players requires a keen awareness about what your opponent is going to do next. I love the prehistoric themes more than any other themes so, I might be biased. I recommend neolithic/ advance cultures with all my heart.

Very clever deck of cards that does a LOT for such a tiny size. Worker placement, not really confrontational, enough options to get the brain working during your turn. A non-gamer will struggle to grasp this I think. I really like it, and once I managed the right 'terminology' to explain what the stacks did in simple words, my partner took off with it and won our first game by four points. It's very hard to see who is actually winning until you add up the scores at the end. Very much a keeper and Clowdus has really nailed this design.

RATING: 8.5
I am becoming more and more impressed with this design.

It's a multipurpose card, worker placement, tableau building game.  The theme is light, but definitely present.  It's not very much like anything I've played before.  It has elements of RftG/SJ, GtR, Roma, maybe the closest thing is Rivals for Catan?

The rules are easy, but with rules on the card stacks and cards that are totally different depending on orientation, it took a half-game to really grok how the game was going to come together.  This isn't a negative; it's simply that the design is rather unique.

So far, vastly different strategies have performed equally well, though the game is more tactical than strategic.

Really enjoying this and with the quick play time, I expect this will hit the table a lot with co-workers.  The size/depth/length ratio of this game is through the roof.

"Single-deck worker placement, dual-use cards, set-collection, tableau game with minor engine building. It's going to take me a couple more games before I really understand how to score well."

What I like:
- Combines worker placement, set collection, and multi-use cards
- Simple mechanisms, but non-obvious play
- Some blocking/denial, and controlling the end of the game, but no pvp
- Single deck of cards in a tiny box, and inexpensive
- Card quality seems quite good
- 30 minutes (or less) to play

What I don't like
- It's hard to see which icons are PROVIDED and which are REQUIRED
- The tuckbox is flimsy--I'll need to craft something more durable
- Minor bit of majority scoring at the end, but it's not bad

A couple tweaks to the graphic design would have made it so much easier to see at a glance which cards do what. PROVIDED icons should be clearly distinct from REQUIRED icons, but they're not. Both should be distinct from the meaningless icons at the top of the culture cards. 

I would put the weight around 2.2 (a bit lighter than San Juan).

This is one of the best micro games out there imo. It is an excellent 2p game where every decision matters. It plays fast, it has agonizing decisions, multiple paths to victory and it feels very thematic. I am very impressed with how well designed it is. This and Isle of Trains are my favorite pocket sized games atm. My only concern is replayability cause I can see it getting samey after subsequent plays. Hoping the designer is working on an expansion. I would back it in a second.

[Small Box Game Kickstarter 16 edition] {Civilisation; multi-purpose cards, action point; 2p} Wow.  Neolithic is a novel 2p game: thematic, intriguing and innovative.  I am glad that I own it.

The rules looks complicated at first; but it becomes easy to master once players understand the flow.

The theme is strong.  The game flow is fluid.  Interaction is good.  Balance between tactics and luck. Great work, John!

RATING: 6
This came highly recommended but, honestly, the rule book and game in general felt incomplete, like it needed a few passes more of development. We liked how the cards had different uses and there was a narrative being told as you built up and advanced your village. But attempts at trying to make strategic plays ended up reminding us that it was a much more random game than it lead us to be believed. We're probably going to try and play again and see if our opinion improves, but this will likely get traded away eventually.

Nice two-player quite thematic worker placement game where cards are both your workers and your scoring options - but you can only score them by removing them from the game. And only on rounds where you haven't used them as workers. This creates a nice balancing act where timing is of utmost importance. You can block your opponent a bit and take cards she needs but it's most of all a race game where depleting two card type stacks signals the end of the game. The Advanced Cultures Expansion is a must in my opinion. 

Expansion: Advanced Cultures.

After two plays (once I got the rules down) one of the smoothest Clowdus games to play and still not quite like anything else. A worker placement, deck-building, set collection game which adheres to the setting of stone age tribes with just enough civ-building to provide an arc of play. I think it's one of the best Clowdus games and a good, strong two player game for lunch time play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is easily John Clowdus' best game since Omen: A Reign of War. It's quite a bit simpler than Omen with very little card text, but the icon based system that's here in its stead has enough depth to keep things interesting. 

The game works on a worker placement model. Send a worker to a card pile to gather a resource, with different piles (hunting, gathering, inventing, etc.) providing different goods. When all the spots are full, all of your workers are deployed, or you just feel like moving the game along, you call the workers home to build your village. They do this using all the resources they acquired while out foraging, playing cards from hand and triggering their effects. This can be actual buildings, new thought technologies or even cultural developments that reward hoarding specific raw materials. When it's all over, the best civilization wins.

What makes a civilization the best though, that changes from game to game. One time it might be the one who hoarded the most stuff. Another time it might be the one that invented the most stuff. Still other games might be decided by the player that best lines up their shamen with their goods acquisitions. This fluid endgame is what makes the game both interesting and highly re-playable, despite its simplicity.

Receiving as an add-on for backing Neolithic: Advanced Cultures on Kickstarter. This is a nice little 2-person card game. It takes a minute to understand the game play and how to score points, but once you get it the game goes pretty quick. A good filler.

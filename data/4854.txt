Had four of the Fleet series for a while before I tried this one, and well worth the wait. A critic might say that the gamey turn sequence (air-sea-or sub in turn) is a bit of a nonsense (there is a General variant). Obviously it works to make this a fun game, but it kinda works anyway, as this is a high level operational system. This is NOT about hardware (although it is all there in the millions of ratings for each unit). This is a game about how you deploy assets to accomplish missions - and the sequencing is just part of that. The Strategic Air part is a really nice addition, and the importance of reconnaissance and detection really shines through. Combat is procedural, and who knows if it is accurate, but it seems proportionate. There are some really nice, simple systems which highlight the importance of things like restricted waters, sea skimmers, and you develop a respect for less well know aspects of performance such as speed and range. Keen to try the rest of the series now. A great selection of game covers as well.

RATING: 8
I have enjoyed shorter scenarios from this title but most of my experience is with its predecessor, 2nd Fleet.  The game is great, but it can be faulted for heaping even more modifiers on the combat processes.  I have my own homebrewed worksheet that tracks the various details, so things flow pretty seamlessly.  I look forward to exploring more of this titles scenarios.

A great game, whith well thought rules, allowing you to easilly play in solitaire mode.
The ability to run sea , undersea and air operations in a simple and well designed way, allows you to enjoy the game. Of course it is not as detailed nor complex as Harpoon or Amirauté, but it as sufficient complexity to feel like an Admiral.The best of the series for me because it is the first that I bought.So 1 extra point for the discovery bonus, but the other games of the serie have the same qualities.

As a matter or principle, I don&#039;t enjoy or seek out &quot;moden wargames&quot; because they give me the creeps - yet I remember this game with fondness. I was a playtester for it when I was at Victory Games and it just seemed to work as a game design. Victory went on to publish many sequels so I guess the public agreed. To me, the thing I remembe most is Joe Balkoski&#039;s use the &quot;limit numbers&quot; in the roll of the dice. That is, if you roll above the limit, there&#039;s a consequence, below and there is not. I went on to use this concept in games I designed once Joe had clued me into the idea.

The Fleet Series is a lot of fun as a simple challenge between two players, as NATO tries to impose their superiority over the WARSAW Pact. Series does not include many intelligence gathering methods of the period. The Map and counters are superb, and the game is rather easy to learn with well written rules.

The second game I encountered with the Victory Game's modern fleet series. Perceivably a complex air-sea joint operations simulation, at the core of the game is really a simple operations-driven system. The game focuses on the world stage hotspot where potential conflict might have erupted into full-scale war between Soviets and the US and his NATO allies. All the battleships, cruisers, destroyers ,submarines, aircraft carriers are all included in accordance with the historical fleet designation, not to mention the dozen types of all the modern air fighters. Different types of sea-air operations are simulated with various scenarios and scenario lengths. The fleet series games introduce many modern military doctrines and concepts like Combat Air Partorl (CAP), area sea search, aircraft readiness, the strengthened role of aircraft carriers as distinguished from naval assets and the joint operation between navy and air forces. Combined arms concept move from between different land forces (tank & infantry & artillery) to air and naval forces (bomber & fighter & battleship). A much more effective regional war effort is amplified by the modern war machine capabilities. The game concept "Operation Cycle" is especially effected well here in the Fleet series than in other Bolkoski's designs (e.g. ACW or WW2). 7nd Fleet covers the Pacific ocean where Communist China and one of the Axis of Evil -- North Korea located.  The threat of the NK long range missle and the Taiwan problem are still eminent after all these 17 years since the game was first released.  An excellent game and an interesting interactive designs. I can assure you'll find this is a challenging and provoking game.  A lot of scenarios are included and the value of historical insight, albeit modern alternative, given by the designer is immeasurable.

This was my first Fleet game, my third Victory Games product.  Great system (in principle), fascinating settings, massive campaigns - I remember to this day playing the campaign and bringing USS Midway home after being crippled by a long range airborne missile strike, all escorts sunk, damaged, or with empty magazines. Great fun at the time.

So why the low rating?  Well, first, the weird all-or-nothing air combat rules which turn air combat into a game of chicken, you let the weak unit past so it doesn't abort your all-powerful CAP on a lucky roll. Second, the logarithmic CRT which works as a great balancing mechanism but as far as I can tell has nothing to do with missile age combat relationships.  Modern combat is about swamping the defenses - more is better, not progressively worse. Therefore, ultimately no relationship to the real operational or strategic concerns. Too bad.

I used to have 2nd and 6th Fleets but they got purged when I went away to college.  So I picked this one up.  I like 2nd Fleet a little bit better because it reminds me so much of the Naval Portions of Red Storm Rising, but this one isn't bad.  Playing with the big map is pretty awesome as it spans the table but it takes a while to play out.  One of these days, I would like to get my hands on 2nd Fleet.

Bulky game, a lot of counters, 3 maps, and the playing system is a little hard because there's a lot of (i.e.) aircraft you must remember where do they come from to rebase them. On the other side, detailed game with independent fuel and ammo register for every individual ship. You will need a very long time for play it until the end if you play the biggest scenarios.

If you enjoy naval combat games, this is a good modern version.  The rules aren't for the faint of heart and you may find yourself hunting a while to track down a particular ship, but it's modern naval combat at a fine level.

Very long, very fiddly, and not particularly accessible.  Fun if you're into the genre and not so bad to pick up if you've played other games in the series, but definitely limited interest for many.

Cor Blimey! My first Fleet game and what a monster! Great fun although played solo for the most part. I always changed the 0 on a D10 to a 10 result to get more spectacular results - it works too! Great scenarios, easy to learn and lots of fun. The strategic air rules and play are a bit rubbish though - who wants to send their precious F-14/15's on strat intercept missions?! Nobody, that's who! Apart from that, I enjoyed blitzing airfields and sinking subs :) Wish they would update this game and bring it up to 2020 standards :)

Rating up one because the situation presented here is more likely to happen in the past or at present. Even though the Soviet naval presence has diminished, the low tolerance of US towards North Korea and the impatience of PR China towards Chinese Taipei makes this theater as explosive as the 1980s. I’m dream of an update for this game: with modernized weapons from China meet the US -- but no more Jet fighter crash with Recon plane, please.

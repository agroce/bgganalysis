Waiting for Thunderstone quest

Great for Solo or 2 players, maybe 3 but could take up to three hours.

Never with 4 or 5 unless you dont care waiting your turn for 10 minutes

Feels mathy to calculate the damage

RATING: 5
Comparison with Dominion cannot be avoided. Thunderstone is essentially the very same game except for the fact that where in Dominion you only have one currency, Thunderstone boasts three. One for buying things in the village and two for buying victory points. I find this an unnecessary complication to a game in which the most interesting part is the analysis of the setup. A game like this should play fast so that you can see whether your analysis was correct or not, but I find Thunderstone a bit too long. You have too many monsters to defeat before the game ends. Furthermore, the transition from village deck to dungeon deck (i.e. from one currency to another) makes the game lag. 

Thunderstone is not a bad game but Dominion is more elegant, for it plays faster and has fewer rule breaking exceptions while still manages to offer the same joy of analysing the setup and devising a strategy.

Maybe it's just that we know nothing about Numenera. But we cannot get into this one like the rest of Thunderstone Advance. The weird coupling of fantasy and sci-fi just doesn't mesh with us. Plus it isn't an expansion but a stand alone game. Odd.

Only one play in but liking this as a stand alone set. Seems balanced, abilities are great and the monsters are nasty (compared to the old thunderstones at least.)

There are a lot of little tweaks that brings this game up from other Thunderstones for me. Cyphers for EXP is fantastic and the board is a GREAT addition and I love how you can disperse more variety in the randomizers with it. Awesome. This bumps it up to an 8 for me so far. The more I play with it, if I find some terrible imbalance I will drop it down.

Thunderstone has been called "Dominion with theme" and this is fair enough, as far as it goes; but with the many expansions and rules variations for this game, I think Thunderstone has made a respectable place for itself in board gaming history. With games like Shadowrun Crossfire and Legendary Encounters taking theme in deckbuilding to the next level, this will seem a bit less like an adventure and more like a well-dressed mechanical endeavor, but it's an enjoyable and attractive one nonetheless. [B]Numenera[/b] brings a unique, nostalgic, quasi-sci-fi slant on the fantasy theme, and adds location cards and enhanced XP tokens, along with everything you need to get started in Thunderstone Advance. A good stand alone version, and a solid jumping-on point if you can handle the fact that the theme is slightly askew from the rest of the franchise.

RATING: 3
The cards in this set are nothing special, the theme does nothing for me, and the one printed scenario we tried ("An Ancient Evil") is poorly constructed and resulted in an overlong session with no excitement.  No thanks, I'll be sticking with regular Thunderstone.

RATING: N/A
Dominion clone done wrong. Tedious counting exercise to assign equipment to characters, and compute attack strengths and light levels at the end of each round. A pasted on theme doesn't make it an improvement over Dominion, especially not with all of the added downtime.

RATING: 8
I like Thunderstone: Numenera for the same reason I like Numenera - it's really imaginative and has a bunch of cool and evocative cards.

It is funny the extent to which Thunderstone Numenera doesn't actually get Numenera, though. One of the core ideas of the Numenera RPG is that you don't get XP for killing things! You get XP for exploration, for discovering and understanding ancient technology/magic; but combat is very explicitly not a way to earn XPs. I'm sure people play it the same way they play D&D in practice, but as designed it is explicitly not a "kill things and take their stuff" game.

Unfortunately, in their quest to make interesting cards, Thunderstone: Numenera has a few problematic cards. Those replicating crystals are the worst offenders and need to be banned unfortunately, but the balance generally doesn't feel as solid as any of the other Advance sets. It's fine, it's still Thunderstone, but that's the reason for my slightly lower rating.

RATING: 10
We played this last night. It's amazing how a few minor extra mechanics can totally elevate a game. Thunderstone Advance is great by itself, but Numenera adds multicolored xp tokens that you can spend for various effects (yellow adds +1 light, red adds +1 physical attack, blue lets you draw a card, etc.) instead of using them to level up your cards. There's also some beautiful oversized setting cards that allow you to roll a d20 at certain times for various effects depending on which one you use. It blends perfectly well with the other Thunderstone sets too.

It helps that I'm totally head over heels in love with the Numenera setting.

This is a nice add-on to the base game, and adds some more "choices" with the multi-colored experience tokens.  The additional cards are nice as well, but it's the tokens that make this worth adding to the rest of the Thunderstone: Advance collection.

I have seen this available a few times at a decent discount, but because my wife and I don't play it very often any more, I don't know if I should get it or not.  But I really like what this adds to the game.

The most immersive deckbuilder I have played. Players try to assemble a party of heroes and other assorted cards to delve into a dungeon and acquire VPs for killing monsters, but they need to be successful or the monster will run away and another will appear, until the Thunderstone bearer appears. Great variety in cards, and can be played either by drafting or with the scenarios that are provided in various sets, some of which are an absolute pain in the ass to progress through.

I love Dominion.  I love Ascension.  I love Legendary.  But I don't love this.  While the math is easy, the game can get bogged down from adding up your attack, and then factoring darkness and abilities.  The game seems to stall out early as player decks get loaded with monsters.  There are turns where you can't do anything to advance the game.  I get bored about halfway through and just wish the game was over.

Why don't you own this game already?  The original Thunderstone was amazing sauce. Thunderstone Advance adds some earlier opportunities for dungeon adventure and seems to be an easier sell with new players.

I generally dislike deck-building games that feature stacks of cards from which all of the players build their decks. However, I did enjoy using the Prepare action to shape my killer hands every other round or so once I've purchased the cards I wanted in my deck. The level up mechanic for the heroes was interesting, too.

I huge standalone set, this is essentially everything you know about Thunderstone dressed up in some new clothes.  There have been a few tweeks.  Experience pieces now come in different colors and can be used for various tasks - adding to attacks, drawing cards, gaining light - rather than just being used to level up heroes.  The Numenera setting is a nice change of pace and the cards functionally work well with Towers of Ruin, Caverns of Bane, Root of Corruption, and the new Starter Set.

This game really grew on me.  At first I didn't like it, but over time i came to really appreciate the mechanics and decision making in this game.

However, over repeated plays it never smoothed out.  There are just tighter deck-builders out there IMO

I think the legendary encounters system achieves this balance better and faster

Thats what i like about this game, there endless ways adding something to it, of course not everything is a good choice, in my oppinion, the siege system is crap, but thats just me, the new settings are nice. I still miss some kind of campaign mode, like the one i postet to the files of towers of ruin (i know its written terrible) but i still have that picture in front of me.

Just like Pathfinder Card game, there should be some kind of score "between" diffrent games, which changes, is harder to get / harder to lose due some kind of round/map/list-system, making it more iteresting to play many more games in a row since you advance or have to fight numbers of waves/villains/defend villages/whatever, there endles ways, Devs just have to pick them up and form some kind of campaign system without killing all the core game rules and make some special for the campaign. It is possible with the normal game rules, which we all love the most. Especially the solo players (like me) would love it.

I swear if the dev team dont, i will make another one soon :)

In the game the different theme is quickly forgotten. The only real difference are the colored experience tokens which can not only be spend for hero upgrades but also as 'chiffres' for various purposes such as increasing battle strength or light depending on the color. The settings don't add much while the 'doomladen' mechanism is only used with selected heroes. That makes Numenera just a new alternative base set for Thunderstone Advance.

In the deck-building game Thunderstone Advance: Numenera, which can be played on its own or combined with other Thunderstone sets, you build a party of heroes to defeat the Thunderstone Bearers.

RATING: 6
I really enjoy Thunderstone, and I like the adjustments made for the Advance version. I haven't kept up with the sets because it doesn't come out too often (only one other person I game with seems to like it) but I like what I have.

I got this in a trade because hey, more Thunderstone. I don't know anything about the Numenera setting, and after one play I can't say I know much more about it. It's a little more technical, as there are chemical injectors and stuff, but at the end of the day it's still more or less Fantasy 101. Our one game barely scratched the surface of this set (we didn't do the settings or anything involving the cardboard tokens.) I like the idea of the XP tokens granting different abilities. Some of the cards we played with were pretty neat, but honestly, as the "world" of Thunderstone is generic to begin with, changing the setting is hardly noticeable, at least to me. 

What I'm saying is, I liked this well enough, but considering that I've barely played the Thunderstone I already have I don't know that I need another entire box of it with some added geegaws. If it can be effortlessly mixed with the rest I may do so, but otherwise I'll just stick with what I have.

Uno de mis juegos favoritos debido al tema y las mecánicas, pues se mezclan muy bien. Vas creando tu equipo para matar a los monstruos y eso hace que tenga sentido equipar armas, usar hechizos y sobretodo subir de nivel a tus héroes. Ahora siempre lo jugamos en modo épico y creo que es mi favorito porque la diversidad de cartas hace que los equipos y estrategias de los jugadores sean muy, muy diferentes.

Un contra es que el set up y la guardada del modo épico son un poco tardados.

Me gusta más el arte de esta versión que el la de Towers of Ruin. Además introduce los tokens de experiencia de distintos colores.

This is one of my favorite Deck Builders, period. Mixes in elements of RPG, with massive replayability and options, love the fact that is completely compatible with other Thunderstone editions. 

Love it.

Awesome game within the Thunderstone system. The only reason I traded it away is because the theme seems off when it is mixed with the other versions of the game.

It's been quite a while since I played Thunderstone: Dragonspire, so it's not clear to me how much Numenera and Dragonspire differ, and I don't really know which I prefer.  What I can say, is that learning how to play is not the hard part--the hard part is figuring out what to do once you have learned how to play and are actually playing.  I think it must take quite a while to learn which village cards are most useful, and in conjunction with which other village cards they will be most effective. I really like the art work on this game, and did notice that a board is now provided on which to display the cards you'll be playing with, as well as the dungeon.  Good addition.   (3+4)

The Numenera spin adds some imaginative stuff. Still maintains Thunderstone Advance feel and pacings, but adds a few nice extra options.

Still, as before, it plays too long for what it does. As of this writing, I'd rather play Ascension, Pathfinder ACG, or Legendary. I wish this was an app.

The Numenera universe is a great setting with interesting backstory that really pulls you in. Since this is a first Thunderstone Advance for me to play, I have to say they have improved it well over the original. Various deck building options, interesting dungeon exploring and interesting card abilities that work well together. It no longer felt like counting money together and going shopping when entering the dungeon.

I love Numenera and I love Thunderstone, so naturally I rated this pretty high, even though I think the cards on display here are a bit more mediocre/dull than the other sets. A shame, because Numenera has so much flavor. Hopefully this set sees it's own Numenera themed expansion.

If I had to choose only one- Numenera or Towers of Ruin I would choose Numenera. The flexibility of using the different colored experience token really does it fore me, otherwise these two are fairly similar. Numenera also offers a great concept of adding Setting cards which add a new mechanic to the game as well: rolling a d20 when certain things happen. You do not have to play with the setting cards, so you can add once you are looking to add more variability to your games. Overall I would rate this game a 7 like the other Thunderstones though.

A fun game when it clicks, which is actually not that often for me.

Opponents lack diversity, in spite of very different-sounding group names like bandits, horrors, and automatons, and not enough Stone bearers. I also don't like that beating the bearer is usually anticlimatic.

The village cards are an exercise in frustration, especially as at least one or two categories in each game selection are utterly pointless and never get picked by anyone. Other cards are less designed to boost your heroes as to hamper other players.

The rule book is not very well organized.

Numenera runs a bit slower (and longer) than the base game of Thunderstone. However, once you hit a stride the game really opens up.

Great game. Some of my students have played Dominion, so they could pick it up pretty easily. I really love the theme and the aspect of trying to complete a goal (kills monsters), opposed to just trying to collect victory points. There is a lot of thinking involved with this game, so I like it for my students too.

Least adaptable/combinable of the thunderstone advance expansions.  Characters are blah, monsters are blah, and the mechanics tends to work best with itself not others.

RATING: 8
if you are in doubt with which starter set to choose between the three available (Towers of Ruin, Worlds Collide and Numenera), absolutely buy Numenera. By far it has the most interesting cards, and two really interesting variants: setting cards that add some variety to what happens during turns, by far much more interesting to me than familiars, and especially the cyphers, i.e. colored experience tokens that can be discarded for temporary effects during play (gain light, attack strenght, gold, draw cards, etc.)
You may be attracted by the more generic and typically dungeon crawling themed cards of the other two sets, but believe me, gameplay-wise, Numenera is by far the best of the three sets.

Thunderstone: Advance is a good game. Looking at this set specifically, though, I can't help but feel that a few of the cards are less exciting in comparison to the others. I've now gone through all three base sets and am unable to fit everything comfortably into one box (even after removing the extra Regulars and so forth). I ended up culling six of the Village items and five of the Hero types, and I believe all but one of those came from the Numenera set.

The one major thing Numenera contributes, aside from the cards (which are still decent, don't get me wrong) are the extra uses for XP, which are colored in this set. This modification will be shipped with the upcoming Into the Abyss set, so if it is the only reason you're interested in TSA: Numenera, you should probably wait.

This game has serious issues as a deckbuilder adventure... the most glaring being that it's NOT co-cop... It's semi co-op, and via poor mechanics...

Basically the game ends when the boss is killed, and there's a scoring system for who did the most adventuring... Thing is, all players lose if the boss gets pulled but no one kills it. Nothing prevents you from taking all your time in the world to build strength and fight the boss and make sure you can win OTHER than the scoring component, so everyone playing nice makes the game too easy... in terms of people being competitive though, the game in essence rewards the players that push their luck and Leeroy Jenkins into fights idiotically until they aggro the endgame, all too likely too early. So assuming the players win, the person playing the most irresponsibly is the victor. It's really just a terrible mechanic that sours anything else the game offers... big thumbs down.

If you really like deckbuilding or the setting then this game is for you.

If you don't, then you'll probably be frustrated by spending turns failing to accomplish anything more meaningful than "buying a torch" or "going into a dungeon and running away again"; by the bizarre monsters that say "you must have EXACTLY THE RIGHT number of attack points to defeat me". 

Victory is all about who happens to be dealt the right combos of cards at the right points of the game.

One of my favorite games. I am really into deck building. I am an avid MTG player and love that this game makes building a deck part of an adventure. The game also had endless replay value on account of the many different combinations to can make from it!

RATING: 7
A great fantasy deckbuilder.  Solo play is touch, but playing with friends has a lot of tactical play...hard to know just who is winning sometimes.

Made better with Epic Thunderstone variant though - truly like embarking on a fantasy adventure, as you use all the cards, not just a subset.  Since you do get lots, this does make sense for that reason too.

RATING: N/A
In comparison to Dominion:
I liked that victory point cards - monsters - also added little something to the gameplay, they weren't such a burden in hand.
It seemed there wasn't much to buy for the money.
Upgrading a unit was nice, but trashed heroes should have gone back to supply.

Finally, a deck building game with theme; not just a veneered theme, but actually plays the way it feels. I haven't played Thunderstone Advance: ToR, since it is out of stock locally, but Numenera is fun, easy to learn and moderately balanced. It does favour deck-thinning/refining and my games do not favour rush style play, and I think that is the fault of the cards. With the expansions (CoB and RoC, which are older than Numenera), the game then course corrects itself. Overall, if I had to pick up a deck-building game as of November 2013, it would be Thunderstone Advance.

Okay deck builder. Not as good as Dominion in terms of gameplay, and not as good as Arctic Scavengers in terms of theme. I don't know how this version compares to other Thunderstone games.

Variety in setup is very nice, but the mechanics are needlessly complicated and the game drags on too much when playing with more than two - considering almost zero interaction, this is a problem.

Okay, so I am not too fond of the semi-fantasy semi-tech theme, but this version brings a couple of nice things. The Cypher tokens is one. The name of the heroes is boring as hell, but in all honesty it doesn't affect the gameplay at all. Like I said, I play this game in Epic mode so all of these cards are mixed up with the rest. With the retrospective though I still recommend Towers of Ruin over Numenera.

RATING: 8
I really like this game. In this deckbuilding game, you really have to optimize your deck, much more than in Dominion, because you don't have a lot of combos like in Dominion. In this game you, have so many more choices than just playing a card, buying a card. 

Plus I feel like, I have more to do with my deck. In Domimion, you're just buying card. In Thunderstone, you have to defeat the monsters(not just buying them, like DC or Ascension)

You should play the epic version though

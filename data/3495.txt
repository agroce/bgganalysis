RATING: 8
This is one of the best designed TCGs I have played.  rules are very simple, gameplay is straightforward, and interactivity is high without being too much to keep up with.  There are lots of viable strategies based on the available cards.  A very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So far I like it. The positives far out weigh the negatives. 

There's very fun artwork on the cards for Potter fans like myself. They include cute little quotes from the books which support the theme of the card. Several artists were involved so you get a variety of fun children's  picture book style drawings.

There's plenty of deck building options to try out different strategies. Do you go for lots of opponent deck damage with Creatures and Spells?  Do you try to deny your opponent actions and make them discard from the table with Adventures and Charms? Maybe you want to go with a strong Quidditch deck and force some Match cards onto the table which you're prepared for with Items and Spells. Maybe you go for lower Lesson card Spells but accumulate damage early and on every turn or try to string a killer combo that requires a high number of Lessons. Your lead Wizard/Witch character often sets the theme for your deck. And with a small 60 card play deck, you have to build a focused deck to be effective.

It's a fast playing game (less than 30 minutes) which is also a benefit as you can do match play like best of 3 games. 

It has a minimum number of rules clarifications in comparison to other CCG's as timing issues rarely come into play.

Overall, this fast, fun CCG is a winner and its' low Geek rating puzzle's me.

CCGs usually don't click with me, but this one was easy to learn, which was a big plus.  I felt like I understood the game and the strategy right away.  CCGs will never be the kind of games that I feel like I have to add to my collection, but this is one that I am willing to play and maybe even suggest because it's easy to grasp and plays quickly.  And consider this: I never read any of the books.  I saw the first movie and hated it so much that I gave up on the franchise, so for me to say it's a pretty good game says more about the mechanics than the theme.

Update: I got a copy because my daughter digs Harry Potter and I thought she might like it.  At least she will know all of these characters and spells that I do not!

Quick-paced trading card game. Depends a lot on luck which cards you draw, and building decks is not a very deep experience. But since a game only lasts about 20 minutes, it doesn't matter too much. Artwork is great.

Found a starter at a local thrift shop, and then supplemented with a card lot off ebay.
Playing the heck out of this game with my daughters!
I'm finding that simple decks work best (bulked up-starters with only 2 lesson types), and with the abundance of cheap cards on ebay, we're going to get a lot of mileage out of this game.

"Magic Lite" they say. I would have to agree. That is not a negative statement in anyway. If you love the deck building and theme combined with fat free mechanics check out this game! Play it with my wife and we love it, its a chance to play MTG without getting a second mortgage on the house and struggling to pay your bills in order to be competitive. Sure it's geared towards a young audience but the game play that makes all MTG style card games so popular is there, with the best part being all the cards are already released and easy to find with affordable prices. Give this blast from the past a try, you wont be disappointed!

i had a gifted starter and a box of boosters rotting in a closet for years.  it's probably for the best that i only discovered them now, because i may have been too much of a magic snob to consider playing it before.  very simple and explainable rules, and overall quite a fun game.  i like it much better than, say, blue moon.  drafting is always fun, but deck construction is quick too.

I picked up a couple starter decks and some boosters to fill my desire for a quick magic-like game that my wife would play (she likes Harry Potter a lot). Unfortunately, this is okay at best. It is very simple and doesn't seem to have as many interesting combos as I had hoped. I don't dislike it, but it is pretty far down the list of games we would pick to play.

Honestly folks. I dont know why this game does not get better press from gamers. We are talking a beautiful card system here. Game play is smooth and deck strageties abound. Its easy, fast, beautiful and fun. A good deck needs little luck to win. Can have fun playing with adults or kids together. Just a real solid game. I think a lot of folks gave up on this one as being to simple without really playing custom decks. It has the spirit of HP through and through. Its kind of like having all new HP adventures!

This is a very good CCG.  It's streamlined, yet still full of interesting choices.  I really like how health is your cards, and you take damage by discarding off your deck.  It means you run through your deck every game, but not all the cards every game.  Nice.  Deck building is much more managable to the average joe, as well.

Discovered this game and bought a few booster boxes since they can be had pretty cheap now (since the game is sadly long out of print). My son loves it. Like others have said, I much prefer playing this with him than Pokemon. 

You have different "sets" of cards you can base a deck from: spells, animals, potions, etc. Each have their unique strength and can be used to balance other sets. You then build a deck of 60 cards using 2-3 of those sets. Very fast game play. A hand may take 10-20 minutes. If you like the world of Harry Potter at all, this is worth checking out. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   

Only interested in cards from the following sets:  Chamber of Secrets, Adventures at Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, and Base Set.

Can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards).  

Not really interested in this one until the starter & booster boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins and I can obtain in bulk.  
Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:5 (1 of my MtG cards for 5 of your HP cards).

I've played many CCGs in the past.  My kids (5 and 8) have gone through YuGiOh and  Pokemon phases (sigh).  The Harry Potter TCG is a welcome breath of fresh air.  I bought a bunch of starter decks when they were cheap at Toys R Us but just brought it to the table recently.  The mechanics are clean and the game is fun.  I'm looking for more cards (not going to go crazy, just get some more cards to fill out some fun decks).

Fun game!

I played it around 2003 after purchasing a couple of boosters in addition to a starter pack. It was... interesting, but I don't think I can rate it fairly after such a long while, because I didn't play many times, as it stopped being imported. I ended up misplacing the few cards I had.

RATING: 6
The rules are among the easiest of all CCGs. 
Not so bad as a matter of fact, but you need a couple of house rules or else everybody ends up playing creature decks.
Like most CCGs, it is best when played in a "cube" format.

Like a simplified Magic -- no life points, when you're through with your deck, you lose.  Easy to play, nice art and variety in the cards.  Quidditch is weak, Potions is powerful, but the best way to win is with Creatures.

I like the Action point system and would like to explore the game a tiny bit more. But that's only because I'm a completionist.

The game is overly simple and cards and creature rules make the game a bit predictable and lacking in drama.

OK for younger kids but even for them, you could have a more exciting game...

RATING: 6
Each player commands a deck of 61 cards and takes on the role of a witch or wizard from the books. The object is to run your opponent's deck out of cards before yours runs out. Decks are built up with "Lesson" cards which come in four types, which allows the user to cast spells and items (a bit like Mana in Magic: The Gathering). A lot of the flavour of J.P.Rowling's books are present here and the game works very well. I'm not a huge fan of collectible card games, but I like this one. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
CCG Gem. This game has enough possibilities to interest serious game players, especially if you are a little sick of overly-fiddley games with 300-card expansions, 17 symbols, and convoluted resource mechanisms. The fact it is clean means that it is perfect for adults to play with kids too. It has a lot of cool stuff happening: hand attack, deck cycling, drawing from discard piles, challenges that can be accomplished by either player, and so much more. Each player is limited by action points, so games are likely to have a lot of incremental decisions. The fact it is not as fiddly as most other CCG's I see as it's biggest strength: you are free to blast through fast-playing games and have some fun. And fun is what games are really about, not degenerate deck construction, stalemate games, or dusty binders full of priceless cards.

Not a bad CCG. Some people call in "Magic lite" which I suppose is as good a description as any. I thought it was fun and really used the Harry Potter theme very well. It was also nice because it was much easier to get your head around than the average CCG. 

I am surprised it never took off, but you can get the cards for dirt cheap prices on ebay.

My biggest problem with this game is: The starter set isn't balanced to begin with! And I mean: not at all.

I won the starter set and added cards to it, just to be able to get it playable. It won't be balanced with my added cards.

Conclusion: I've been putting way too little money on this one to be playable! I'm not very happy with games that do that. I don't think a good game should ever be this unbalanced, requiring buying tons of cards to it, not without promising to get better with more cards. (In my opinion it got even more unbalanced the more I added!)

I'd not bother with this one - pay money to get a good game instead!

[Collectible Card Game, Fantasy]   {Have only played with the two-starter pack and 4 boosters} Yes, I know that adults aren't the target market of HPCCG. Wizards of the Coast set out to make a version of Magic: the Gathering more accessible to younger players, and especially the holy grail - young girls. I think they made a pretty good effort with this game. It's nice looking, it plays well, but that turns against itself. In the end, the game becomes rather boring because it has very little depth. I've seen eight-year olds playing other "adult" CCGs like Magic, Legend of the Five Rings and CCG-alikes like Clix. Then again, it just might be the old MtG pro in me talking. I DO think that the license was used effectively. The art is very nice, and the quality is up to the usual high Wizards of the Coast standards. (The holo foil wizards were remarkable. I got one in one of my boosters. Is it worth anything?) I'm sure that this game appeals greatly to its target audience, theme and all.

I am not a ccg person, but I am a fan of the Rowling series (with exception to the Deathly Hallows).  I find this game does a splendid job at alluding to the events in the first few books while enabling a fun wizarding duel between players.  I like the mechanic that the card pile is both your spell/creature supply and also your health.  This forces some tough decisions, and creates an interesting thematic idea that using magic is physically draining.  All in all I have enjoyed every game I have played, and look forward to more.

Surprisingly effective M:TG rejiggeration.  Easy to teach and learn, but a LOT of strategic depth.  Actually played this "competitively" (as competitively as you can play it) for a while and had a mish-mosh deck that never lost.  Yay!  The theme was good, the art was fun, the collectibility was juuust enough without going overboard.  Was out right at the height of Potter book mania, so I was surprised and disappointed this didn't do better.  Some cross-marketing in book stores would have been great, but no such foresight or luck with this one.

This is the Harry Potter license applied to the Magic:the Gathering card game. Each player employs a character or wizard from Hogwarts. These wizards (planeswalker) impart special effects (e.g. draw additional cards, deal additional damage) that reflect your deck composition and style of play.

The different mana types are tapped to summon creatures, play spells or scenarios that exert effects once certain criteria are met. Damage and decking out your opponent ultimately transpire in a win.

While interesting in concept, one should invest in the alternative: Magic. Magic is not necessarily the better game, but it shares almost all of the same mechanics as the Harry Potter TCG and has a much larger, more universal player base.

Quidditch Cup:
Approximately four opened booster boxes of cards, including multiple card sets, holofoil cards and characters.

Diagon Alley:
One opened booster box of cards, including a number of rares, holofoil cards and characters therein.

Collection: I have at least one copy of every card. 

Plays quickly and has a lot of room for strategy, but mostly from a deckbuilding perspective. Can be had cheaply for a CCG, but that still isn't especially cheap, especially to get 4 copies of some of the best cards.

One of the better trading card games, which I enjoyed much more than MAGIC, because even going against an established deck you seemed to have a decent shot.

RATING: 8
The kids love it! (5 and 8 y.o.) 

Thrift found 2 starter sets, plus purchased some additional cards via Ebay and, later, those (3 for a buck) Dollar Tree Quiddich boosters! I was missing lessons so I purchased additional (just) lesson cards on Ebay. That gave me about 11 different player stacks, enough to keep us busy for awhile. I didn't try to go for killer decks, I mainly tried to balance all the decks as much as possible while using different spells for each, so that you could randomly pick two sets and play them against each other without being unbalanced.
I still have a bunch of booster packs that might hold surprises in them.

CCG&#039;s and I have a love/hate thing.  They love my money, I love my money.  They hate for me to not spend it on them.  I hate to spend it on them, but I love to buy the cards.  I end up in a dilemma that has me either buying none or dumping a minimum of $80-100 dollars.

Bought a booster box of each set for my girlfriend for Christmas off of Amazon for a fraction of the original cost, and the game proved to be a huge hit. The mechanics are simple, as the game is designed for young kids, but the theme is great, the card choices are great, and it's just a lot of simple, quick fun. We probably played 50 games in the week between Christmas and New Year's alone.

The fact that the game is out of print has mixed results. It's a shame that the material in the series is only covered through Chamber of Secrets, but it also means that the CCG money sink aspect is almost entirely removed.

Eeee, nem tudom, nekem ez így azért elég kevés. Egyrészt persze jó, hogy egyszerű, gyors, másrészt viszont úgy érzem, hogy azért az átlagosnál is kevesebb a mélység benne. Azzal, hogy a sebesülés egyben lapdobás is, gyakorlatilag tervezhetetlen az egész. Harry Potter rajongóknak jópofa filler lehet "Magic for dummies" címszóval, de egyébként nem nagyon tudom, kinek ajánanám. Gyerekekkel jó lehetne, ha nem lenne nyelvfüggő.

My first real foray into the world of CCGs, and I don't think I could pick a better one to start and end with. I love the Harry Potter universe, and I have to say that as a fan I really enjoy this one. I can see why CCGs are known as money pits, but my set is now at a decent size that I can make just about any deck that I want to with the cards that I have. The rules for the game are pretty simple and will be easily understood by kids as young as 7 or 8. I am hoping to get to play this more in the coming months to see if the rating holds up, but right now I am quite pleased with my hunting and searching that I did to acquire this game.

The Harry Potter TCG gameplay has a streamlined elegance, and is much easier to teach than most CCG.  Also, the theme is more palatable to wives and young children.
And considering how cheaply you can get boosters (eBay, etc.) I wish I would have started on this one earlier, instead of buying new WoW cards for full $.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun to play with the kids - we have a ton of cards that we got exceptionally cheap.  We do all kinds of drafts and create a wide variety of decks.  I prefer this to playing Pokemon with them.  Think of it as Magic: The Gathering - Very Lite.  I keep coming back because we have so much fun playing this!

After about 200 plays or so, I have to raise the score again.  Just so much fun.  Built decks and drafting are both full of strategy and tough choices.  Fast to play too!

Many plays in the summer of 2008 - I created a ~570 card draft set and drafted with 2 to 5 players many, many times.  Mostly 60 card decks (5 rounds - 12 card packs, then build with your best stuff).  A huge number of games played now with these drafts and my kids.  We are hooked bad.

We also create our own cards and play balance them for cost and power.  Adds a whole new element as this game is a 'dead' CCG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good, simple TCG. 

Variable player powers - each deck has a character from the HP books. Each character has something unique about them - HP draws an extra card, Hermione can play 2 lessons for one action and so on. 

Each turn has 3 phases - creature damage phase
draw phase
action phase 

The object is to beat your opponent by running them out of cards in their deck. 

Creatures only damage the opponent (unlike many other CCGs where creatures can interact with each other) 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Played more than 280 times. After 120 plays I decided to rate this a 10. This game is so smooth, with no timing-issues, no elaborate blocking and stuff. I really enjoy the gameplay and the deck-building in this one and it plays really quick. Games usually take 10-15 minutes for me and our 12-yo. Some good decks have been a little obvious to play, and a lot of the strategy is in the deck-building, but then I have also built more thinky decks that work well and make for more decisions in play. My biggest gripe with the game is that some cards are strictly worse than others. I really recommend you give this a try if you are looking for a simple CCG. Cards can still be found for a good price.

RATING: 6
This trading card game attempts to capture the feel of a Wizard Duel with mixed success. The theme is strong with the types of spells being well done and choosing which wizard to play as is a good idea, however the artwork isn't that great and it feels like a bit of a cash grab.

RATING: 8
Two plays, both enjoyable, and I officially like this game. It's fast, easy to learn and teach and is surprisingly tactical. You may have to adapt your tactics or be flexible in your approach. It seems like a good deck will let you compensate to some degree for bad luck or an unexpected deck from your opponent.

I'm not a big Harry Potter fan, either, so it's not nostalgia or fanboyism that attracts me to it. It's that I can find the cards and build a collection for a reasonable price, deck-building is fairly quick and not too difficult and I have an opponent who enjoys the game, too. I cannot say most of those things about too many other CCGs.

The real genius of this game is that its depth to simplicity ratio is off the charts. For a fairly insubstantial set of rules, there is just a ton of variety. And for a TCG, it's pretty cheap to build a play set--less than a buck a pack, except for the rarest set, if you're patient, or a nice-sized collection of 1,000 cards for less than 50 bucks. 

I'm looking for a few uncommons and some rares from the first four sets, plus a fair number of rares and uncommons from Chamber of Secrets. I want the non-foil versions if available. Working on a want list.

A don't-think-it-can-possibly-work-but-somehow-it-does concept for a TCG. Swift and flexible, but like all of its ilk, you've got to put in the time and money to get the most out. A shame that some of the expansions are nearly impossible to get one's hands on and occasionally even the best-built deck can be screwed up by a poor shuffle.

The rating for this should probably be higher, at least a 7.5, but I do not want to show too much ccg bias.  Basically Magic Lite with a familiar theme.

The game was unfortunately plagued with a lack of good players since it appealed to mostly young kids who were not ready to handle mtg.

Fairly bland but unobjectionable, I thought at first.  But using an inexpensive drafting cube makes it pretty enjoyable.  8-yo daughter enjoyed the starter decks, so now moving on to decks I've constructed from the cube.  Bumped from 6 to 8.  Have now done a game helping her construct from a draft.  Great fun!

Update:  Now the boy is into cube drafting....

This game is the reason I became a gamer. In 2001, I bought it from my friend at a garage sale for a dollar. After playing it together, he went out and bought it for $10 at a store within the week. It's a great substitute for Magic: the Gathering, with WAY easier rules and less complexity while providing more than enough strategic depth for youngsters. This led me to MtG, which led me to Munchkin, which led me to Settlers of Catan, which led me to Power Grid and Cosmic Encounter and boardgamegeek.com...and it all started with this little card game. This is the perfect gateway game to Magic: the Gathering or anything else really. Shame it went out of print.

i think the low ratings for this game are a shame. i can only imagine that people are rating this after one play with the basic rules and/or are letting their opinion of the theme color their opinion of this ccg as a game. i don't care about harry potter one way or another, but this is a good game. it has streamlined rules and play, some clever ideas, and there are a couple of different deck types and strategies available to players. it has the odd card here and there that is unbalanced, but i can't think of one ccg where this isn't true. overall, this game is a very solid effort that plays quickly and is pretty fun.

One of my favorite games ever. This TCG represents everything I love about the Harry Potter series, and stays faithful to the original books (unlike the movies). A fun, streamlined game with beautiful artwork and a high level of collecting and strategic value. This is one of the best games to be discontinued, and it was a real shame that it didn't pick up a lot of steam or develop a large fan base. I grew up on this game, and continue to love and play it today.

It's a decent trading card game, much in the same vein as the others that I have played.  I do like the theme, but it loses some of the magic of Harry Potter somehow.  It was good to try once, but not one I'm planning on expanding.

RATING: 5
Decent stripped-down CCG with most of the elements that made Magic fun for a while, and without some of the weight that eventually dragged it down for me.  Deck construction themes are a little too forced, but that's not unusual for third-gen CCGs.  I do like the prominent recursion mechanic, which helps "decking" games like this one.  Surprising similar to WotC's WCW Nitro wrestling game.  In the end, a good buy for HP fans, a moderately decent midweight CCG for non-fans.

My wife made me buy this and I was pleasantly surprised.  The game is fun and reasonably well-balanced. I've only seen the movies, so some of the art and cards give my wife something to share with me when they are of characters who didn't make the cut for the movie.

The poor ratings for this game are disappointing. I believe many people toss it off as "Magic-lite" (which isn't necessarily a bad thing for bringing new people into CCGs). In truth, the expansions bring depth to the game and, unlike many CCGs, the game doesn't just mill about waiting for someone to play the killer combination. Often slow and steady can win the race. Recommended.

Own Diagon Alley starter and base game starter. 2 x booster boxes of base, 1 x booster of Quidditch Cup.

Simple CCG where you take a HP character and put out lesson cards (resources/land) in order to cast spells, creatures, etc. The object is to make the opponents deck run out first.

Takes some elements from MtG but greatly simplifies mechanics for target audience.

Later expansions added extra layer of cards including a Quidditch 'in-game' mechanic. Cute and thematic.

Not a bad game at all. Good art.

Just wish it was still in print. I'm still waiting for the day I find a shoebox full of these cards from a thrift store or flea market. 

Update: I did find sealed booster boxes a few years after my wish!

RATING: 5
You know, this game is alright. I've only played the basic rules, but I give it a 6 so far. As many have said before me, the game seems like a streamlined Magic, with lessons cards for mana (which you do not need to tap), and a very rough equivalence between colors (Magic) and lesson types (HP). In the basic version, you get to perform two actions on your turn, such as summon a creature or cast a spell. There are no interrupt-type cards as in Magic, so you own your turn completely. Your opponent cannot interfere. Of course, this takes away some of the confrontational zest which Magic offers up in such abundance, but it makes for a more straightforward game that can be played (and played well) by young children. This makes Harry Potter one of my top choices for "least painful game to play with my daughter", who just isn't quite old enough for Commands and Colors: Ancients.

Further play sees this dropping to a 5 for me, but my daughter would probably rate it a very solid 8.

[2005] -- Diagonalley Starter Set
Have played a couple of games with the starter set. Only 40 cards (+1 wizard) per player rather than the usual 60 cards (as written in the rules), and it looks like they kept to the simpler cards. As an introduction to the game it is fine.

I really like the "X damage == X cards discarded from your stack mechanic" linked with "you lose if your stack runs out of cards" -- very simple and elegant.

Can't wait for my box of boosters to arrive.

Fantastic CCG that was overlooked because it was aimed at a younger audience.  I has a few wonderfully innovative mechanics with tremendous variety in deck building.  At one point I had my whole team of developers playing this game at lunch.  Unfortunately, that was 6 or 7 years ago.  Since then I have been stocking up on booster boxes via eBay in the hope of playing this game with my son when he becomes old enough to get into Harry Potter.

I've come to realize CCGs aren't very fun unless you have an opponent who wants to build their own deck.  Besides that, I think the game is pretty good and the "your deck is your life" mechanism is neat.  The card selection is fairly limited by the mechanisms of the game, though.

RATING: 6
This is unabashedly a Magic the Gathering knock-off, with the main twist being that creatures never fight each other but simply do direct damage, represented by discarding cards from your draw pile. The object is to run the other player out of cards. It's a bit simpler than Magic, and not surprisingly so, given the younger target audience. Nevertheless, it's quick, thematic and kinda fun. Better than I thought it would be, and certainly recommended for tweens and early teens who like the books/movies.

My first foray into a CCG, I picked this because of my son's interest in the stories.  So far, it's been a great fit - simple enough play (certainly age appropriate for a 9-year-old), fun to collect (familiarity of the characters and some of the creatures or spells and not an overwhelming number of cards in the base set), and quick to play (about 20 minutes).  The thrill of opening booster packs was great and I've even met with  local fans to do some card trading - fun stuff!

I'm curious about how this might play with adults - so far my only plays have been with my son.

This is one of the games my 8 year old can play and play well. We are gettig into the booster decks and are still loving it. 

The basic game is deck draining, try to get your opponents deck to zero cards and you win. The basic decks have spells and creatures to aid in doing this while the more advance deck adds devices, location quests and the game of quiddich.

All in all a solid card game you can play with your kids. I dont know about you but the world needs more good ones in that category.

:star::star::nostar::nostar:

Lacks interactivity. There's no defending against most of the main ways to kill your opponents, so there's very little "control" elements (in the Magic paradigm). It's just aggro or combo. Considering that it's one-on-one competition, that makes it much more of a race than many CCGs.

"I damage you." "Okay, here's a quest that makes problems for you. And I damage you." "Okay, I damage myself for the quest and damage you." Etc. There are decisions to be made, but you are rarely put in a position that requires much thought.

The theme is well-used, but it's less fun than I'd hoped. I wish there would be better games making use of the HP property, because my wife would auto-play them with me.

I used to play this with my eldest son when he was about 8 years old, we loved it back then and rated it a 7. Now 10 years on I have started playing it with my youngest son who is now 8 years old and have fallen in love with the game again. It is a simple game to learn and play, and plays fast, no longer than 20 minutes. It is very portable. After a few more plays I will show my son how to build a deck to introduce him to the idea of customising ones deck.

It's a great little game for kids (and not bad for adults).  Deckbuilding is a PITA as usual, but much simpler than in most CCGs.  Some luck, too, so kids can win. There is a strong RPS element at work, too, which is yet another part of the "things traditional CCGs get wrong" list.

I find I really dislike the Lesson (Magic: Land) concept.  L5R does it, but manages to inject a bit of distinctness.  Nevertheless, it's just dumb to have a chunk of a deck devoted to something as uninteresting as a base resource (aside from mana screw issues that arise).  No wonder Garfield moved away from it in his more refined designs....

My wife is not into CCGs as they require you to know many many cards and their effects. But she is a huge HP fan and this game is right down her alley. She even started building her own decks, how cool is that.
The game itself is really good - a streamlined form of Magic - and it plays quickly. The best for me - it is very thematic. The cards resemble their counterparts from the books very well and the illustrations are lovely (and family friendly) and of consistent quality.
This is THE family CCG - and nobody knows why it was discontinued so suddenly. A reboot (as an LCG - FFG?) would be great.

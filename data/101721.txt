This game feels like 2 mages fighting each other to the death. With many different schools of magic, and spells its easy make a custom Mage that feels like a certain Mage, be it necromancer, driud, priest, beast master. If you enjoy different types of magic you will enjoy this game.

RATING: 6
Mage Wars delivers exactly what you'd expect: two mages going toe to toe with plenty of asymmetrical spell casting goodness covering every type imaginable from enchantments, conjuration, slinging fire and lightning, traps, wands,  teleporting - the works. It is rigidly designed so nearly everything is formalized into phases - something very necessary in this type of game to minimize arguments over rules and effects - and it makes for a 'sensible' play experience. However, it takes awhile to play the game due to the slow slog of damage and counter healing/protection (this likely depends on the style and familiarity with the spells in the game). So not a game I am likely to own, but is a game I'm willing to play (if I have the time).

RATING: 6
When I first saw the components for this game, I didn't think I was going to enjoy it.  I'm not a fan of tactical games where players are moving units around the board and rolling dice for attacks.  So it was quite a surprise to me when I ended up really enjoying this game.  The game seems to have good strategic options and lots of replayability.  As far as dueling games go, I really enjoy this one.

Addressing the aforementioned concerns, the board only has 12 spaces, so while there is a bit of tactical maneuvering, this is not the main focus of the game.  And the dice add some randomness without being an overwhelming factor in the game.  This is because the range of numbers on the dice is only 0-2, rather than 1-6, and you're rolling lots of dice, which means over time luck with the dice should just about even out.

I was concerned that having one's entire deck at their disposal would create an analysis paralysis nightmare, but the fact that you can only pick two cards to use each turn actually limits the number of decisions you have to make and helps turns move more quickly than they would if you had access to your whole spell book throughout each turn.  And, obviously, having access to your whole spell book means you don't have to worry about not drawing the cards you need when you need them.  And the ability to customize the spellbooks with a sort of deck-building process really appeals to the CCGer in me.

UPDATE: After playing for the first time with constructed spell books, I still enjoy the game, but it is not a short game.  We played a 2v2 team game that took 2.5 hours, which longer than I like to put into a single game.  This has bumped my score from 8 to 7.  I still enjoyed it, but can't see playing it all that often.

+Nice balance of tactical play and deep strategy.
+Spellbook allows access to all of your cards every turn.
+Ability to customize your spellbook.
+Relatively simple rule set.
+Quality art and components.
+Lots of room for designers to explore in expansions.
+Once players are familiar with the game, it plays quickly.

-Having access to the entire spellbook can be intimidating for new players.
-Lots and lots of keywords require lots of flipping through the rulebook.  Really needed to include cheatsheets for these.
-A few fiddly rules and ambiguous card interactions (but what expandable card game doesn't have these?)

RATING: 7
Very interesting mix of Summoner Wars (moving around a board) and M:tG.  I really like the idea of your wizard being your avatar, so this fits up my alley.  I also like the strategic implementation instead of just a 'i attack you block'

I've been playing a lot of this with my boys (13 and 10). 

Really enjoying it. It's long, but so far the kids enjoy it enough that it comes out a lot. We've accumulated most of the expansions now, and the options are quite interesting but don't fundamentally change much. Just more options.

The exception is the battlegrounds: domination expansion. I really enjoy the modular board and the ability to play with 3 players. Together, I rate them a 9.5.

Much like Magic, except affordable (!) and more tactically interesting. Eliminates significant amounts of luck by giving you access to your entire deck at any given time, but reintroduces a little randomness with combat dice—a big improvement, in my mind.

This is by far one of my favorite games I have ever played. The mages are unique and well balanced, there are mismatches. 
It gives you the MTG or Yugioh fix that no other game does for me. It also eliminates all of the luck of the draw aspects that the other deck builders have.
Building the deck can take any where from a few min to a couple of hours depending on your experience.
The learning curve is quite steep and daunting to begin with.
There is enough in the box for 2 players without expansions but will leave you arguing on who gets what.

Very good 2-player card game. Each player is a mage fighting his opponent in an arena. The game comes in a big box with space for cards and future expansions. It has a huge board and 2 spellbooks to place your cards in. Rules are not very complex but each card has a lot of abilities and keywords. The tutorial game takes about an hour but the full game took us over 3 hours! You have so many options in this game so it is prone to Analysis Paralysis. Nice artwork.

I admit that the game is very thematic and with a lot of tension and fun. I like the tactical options it provides. You just need a dedicated partner to get the most out of the game.

At first, Mage Wars seemed incredibly overwhelming and confusing to play. However, after our second play, my fiancée and I really enjoyed it and have found ourselves constantly wanting to play again. My advice would be to give it some time to get used to the rules and cards. We both are really enjoying it! 

It's also really cool because of the amount of customization that can be done without having to buy any cards or anything. We haven't begun to scratch the surface with that. I like the fact that the company has videos showing how gameplay works. I think with a relatively complex game, it's a really great idea. The codex is also really helpful. Overall, it's a really well done game. 

Also, the customer service with this game is great! I had a defective spell book, emailed customer service, and had a replacement in a few days!

A great 1v1 game. Highly suggest a second set for 1v1v1 or 2v2 games.  There is a large variety of cards and it is set up to support many different styles.  Game is a bit complicated and you have to remind yourself of rules once in a while but a great game that reminds you a bit of Magic: The Gathering with a tactical board set up.

Azt hallottam, ez a játék a Summonerhez hasonló, csak annál jobb. Nos tényleg látszik a Summoneres ihletés, de ez más kategória: a Summoner szabálya kb. 5 perc, és az alap faj paklikkal azonnal nekiállhatunk a játéknak akár egy kezdővel is, egyedül a nyelvtudás a kritérium. A Mage Wars viszont szerintem kifejezetten gémer játék, gyakorlott kártyásoknak való, még erősebb a nyelvfüggőség is, és több a lehetőség. A Summoner is mélyíthető a kieg paklikkal, de a M.W. alapból is sokkal komolyabb. Nekem nem tetszett 1 parti alapján annyira, mint anno a Summoner az első játék után... De ez is egy olyan játék, amit több tucatnyi játék után kéne csak véleményezni.
Még egy megjegyzés a játék BGG pontszámához: anno amikor először megnéztem, amikor még csak pár százan szavaztak rá, akkor még szinte csak kamu szavazatokat adtak a játékra, az adta meg neki a kezdőlökést(értsd: több tucatnyi azonos időpontban bekönyvelt nick-ről egy-egy értékelés volt csak, a Mage Wars-ra adott 10-es)... Ezért fenntartásaim voltak a játékkal kapcsolatban, de végül is nem rossz.

This game is awesome, when you ever understand the rules. It takes a long time to get to know the game but if you know the rules, there is a whole new world opening. This game is hard to learn and hard to master. I always play it with the same person, and almost always lose, except if I search for strategies on the internet and make up a strategy in advance. Almost no change is in this game, only the attack and condition dice. This makes it super strategic and fun to play. As I said, I lose a lot with this game but after every game I am excited to start a new one with another (hopefully better) strategy and I always take a lot of time evaluating where it went wrong and what I could have done differently. Good game! Lost of fun and a lot of thinking. Because it takes a long time (including deckbuilding) I always am very into the game while playing and am almost doing roleplaying. I love this game!

I can see where this is a system that can get a ton of replay, although the spellbook building (which takes place pre-game) looks like it can be lengthy. Which is both a pro and a con.

Not bad, but I don't think I'm going to dive into this one. It's a touch too long and more of a lifestyle game (that you have to play quite a bit to really enjoy) than I'm looking for.

Well, this the most anticipated game that let me down. Too much complexity that does not produce a robust feel in the game, like MtG does. Although I have to say I do not like summoner wars, and this is something like summoner wars + a whole lot of spells. I feel a bit confused. This game has everything I would expect in a game and still I didn't like it as much as I predicted.

RATING: 7.5
Take Magic the Gathering, add a board and don't restrict players' choices with a hand, but let them play whatever they wish from the entire grimoire. This is Mage Wars.
When I heard something like that, I thought it was insane and couldn't work.
But it works, and the game is great!
Mage Wars is the deckbuilder's dream, and it offers out of the box gazillions of options (something LCGs achieve only after MANY expansions and lots of money spent!).
And it is also an engaging game, one where you can't have a hand that plays itself, one with real interaction, and where skill matters.
A great, ambitious design. A great game.

A very interesting take on a card game. Having a geographical element to consider adds another dimension to the traditional card game format. The deckbuilding experience without the death-by-bad-draw element is very attractive. This aspect really levels the playing field and provides an arena in which players can test and develop their strategic and tactical wherewithall. In the beginning the game can run a little long for a two-player affair. Have not yet tried the multi-player variant.

LOVE IT! As a regular mage-style character in D&D I loved the idea of building a spellbook and going head to head with another mage. The game is very fun and despite my tendancy to over-analyse whenever I play any game, the game still seemed to move along at a good pace. The only things stopping me from going out and getting this are:-
Out of the box it can only play 2 player
I can see players taking a long time to build a spellbook which does not go over too well at a gamenight
All in all I would play this any chance I got and while I would love to customize a deck I am happy enough to even play with apprentice spellbook just to be able to play this. Can't wait to see what else they do with this.

As for one on one battle oriented games, this is the best I have tried. I'm saying this as someone who is not really into battle games and the mages fighting each other until one dies theme does nothing for me. But the game is exciting and really well designed. For a while I went all in on it and bought everything, but I haven't played in a long time and as with all LCG's (that aren't soloable like LOTR LCG), they become unplayable if you don't have somebody to play with with the same level of enthusiasm for the game as you. A shame, because I feel this is Magic The Gathering improved.

A battle to the death mage duel played with a pre-chosen set of spell cards.  Each player has a spell book of cards and can choose spells from his or her spellbook to do a wide variety of things -- everything from summoning monsters, casting traps on the gameboard, increasing mana generation / attack / defense.  I enjoyed this game even when I was losing as I felt like there were still things to do. The long set-up time, lack of people to play with and long gameplay time makes me play this less than I would like.

Used to own - absolutely loved the concept and gameplay of it all, but I found it difficult to get played. When when I did get to play, my matches felt one sided. Why? 

Many of my friends felt overwhelmed by the fact that you could play nearly any card from your entire spell book. Knowing MMO/trading card game terminology seemed to be almost a requirement to not feel bogged down by the AP this game can create. I literally only had one good match, and it was because of this reason and not by any fault of the game balancing what so ever.

I also remember it requiring a rather slow start in the game play. Getting your monsters out and equipment on...Rather have some sort of pre-set up option in the rules to move it along

In the plethora of Magic the Gathering clones, Mage Wars really stands as the most innovative and compelling spinoff, way more enjoyable than its forefather: actually it takes the fun part of Magic (that is, casting spells and bashing your opponent) and combines it with a hint of theme (however thin it is), many dice to roll and a spellbook each player can choose his next spells from.

Not only makes all of this for a slightly more strategical game but it also brings lots of fun and interaction into the game, without having to waste a fortune on buying decks, boosters and single cards. [i](November 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’ve grown tired of Mage Wars quickly: just like Magic the Gathering does, a huge chore of this game too is building your own spellbook, which I can’t stand.

Since there’s no doubt a well-made spellbook benefiting from cards synergies has countless more chances to defeat a sloppier spellbook, most of my games are one-way only: this is why during my Fall 2015 rating revise I felt compelled to lower my rating from 9 to 7, the same as Magic the Gathering’s.

RATING: 6
This game is actually pretty sweet, however some of the downfalls have forced me to bring down my rating.  The main problem with the game is that it has so many keywords, and if you do not play regularly, each game can take a ton of time since you are constantly trying to remember how different things work. The 2nd big downfall for me is that it feels like the game can take too long to ramp up.  Everyone usually spends the first few turns just building their stuff up, which kind of kills the excitement for the first 30min or so.  Lastly, I'm sure if you play regularly, the deck building aspect is cool, however I just have zero interest in the deck building aspect.  I would have preferred to have preset mages, with a few customization options that came pre-balanced.

I love the aspect of being able to look at your entire deck while playing this game, this adds a whole different level of strategy into the game that allows you to cater to each situation.  The ability to build your deck in any way you wish is a huge plus in this game.  Only issue I have with this game is that, personally, I seem to get into the "table flip" mood when playing (personal issue), but I guess that I just love the game that much.

My new game obsession. Building spellbooks and creating plans, with counters and reactions, never felt so thematic. A plethora of statuses and keywords take a bit to get into, but everything works like you think it should, so that helps tremendously. The variety is amazing, too. Because of the ability to choose your cards, the danger is the "perfect" strategy. Hopefully the designers stay on top of that as we go.

This was a fun game that pits two players directly against one another. While the game play is great, in the end I sold it because it just never saw the light of day with me and my wife.

Huge amount of rules to ingest but as with most games, just start playing and the penny eventually drops.

I've not played the full game yet - just the 'apprentice mode' - but it's fair to say that I've fallen head over heels in love with Mage Wars.

Fairly new (and late) to the world of gaming and still very much finding my feet, but I'm slowly discovering that I appear to be a 'theme junkie' and this game is dripping with it.

Arcane Wonders have succesfully managed to marry that great theme with what seems to be very high level tactical play, (chunky) dice chucking, and beautiful components. The result is nothing short of a masterpiece.

I can't commit to a 10 just yet, as I may just be experiencing the honeymoon period with this game. However I suspect it will remain one of my favourite games for a very, very long time.

Here are some interesting build to try.
However, have to look at the changes to Wizard's ability and Wizard's Tower if playing competitively.  But most probably I would not bother as I am playing this game casually.

Get Gate to Voltari out at the start of your turn.
Summon Gremlins and Hydras supported by teleport
Hydras weakneses are Agony, Divine Protection, and Weak  There are however, 6 Dispels, a Dispel Wand and Purify.
Leverage on Voltaric Shield to provide early armour.
Cast Regrowth to withstand the onslaught.
Use zap and then guard to protect Gremlins.
Attack with Wizard Tower.
Cast two Mana Crystal.
Play Gate and Harmonize.
Teleport Opponent into Hydra.
Gorgon don't do much to Undead.
When opponent does not summon Mana channeling spells, then focus on getting armour out and regrowth.

M:tG on a board, or Mage Knight without the figs. Plus, "infinitely customizable" which is right next door to "collectable" - and that is really all you should need to know, unless you liked what they did to Dominion and the rest (and you've got the shelf space)...

RATING: 9
Provisional rating (only played with 'apprentice' decks so far). OMG, I think this is the game I've been looking for; it's MtG mixed with WizWar. 

If you've ever played Magic the Gathering and been frustrated with mana screw or clump, or just wished there was a board where you summoned the creatures and moved around ... then give Mage Wars a try. You build your spell book (rather than a deck) and have all your spells available all the time. How cool is that? :)

And you put the cards on a board and move them around, taking turns to attack.

Yes, it's complicated, yes there are a bizillion keywords, all different and with no 'reminder' text next to them (wish they'd done that, like Magic does), but it oozes theme and now I've played I can't stop thinking about it, what sort of deck would I build etc.

Some will moan the dice destroy your plans, but I'm fine with a bit of random outcome in combat, this is a game of a mage battle after all, not a game of chess. When I want perfectly planned magic battles I'll play Mage Knight.

Not sure I'd ever play more than 2 player, but I feel the same about MtG.

Awesome dueling wizards game.  Extremely thematic and immersive.  Lots of variety in spells and strategies.  The spell book idea is really neat instead of drawing from a deck.  It eliminates due to bad starting hands or draws.  Of course the game has dice so there's some tense moments and a little chaos too which is fun.  Having to plan two cards a turn is a great mechanic too.  Maybe a little too heavy/complex- but there's a ton of cool cards and there's so much to play around with and explore.

After my long history with Magic the Gathering I felt this might take the spot (although I never felt the need to replace Magic, I just stopped playing it some day and didn't even feel bad about it).

So, we had our first game. Yeah, it really summons the feeling I had with MtG but in a more casual way. Maybe I felt a lack of cards/possibilities, maybe it was the movement part but somehow I wasn't that happy with Mage Wars.
It is a pretty descent game and I am willing to play it again... But it didn't hit me as much as I expected it to. Maybe I have to grow into the game and maybe this will change my opinion.

I was skeptical of this one at first. It seemed bloated and the concept of an 'open deck' seemed like it just wouldn't work.  But I've become a convert.  This game combines the tactical maneuvering of a minis game with the clever card play, combos, and surprise of Magic, and costs far less to get into than either of them.

Magic: The Gathering on a board, but instead of having to rely on luck of the draw you have your entire deck available in a spell book. You can play any card at any time as long as you have the mana. Each mage has a drastically different playstyle (several actually, depending on how you build your spell book). Mage Wars is the ultimate Fantasy Badass Simulator.

My first game was surprisingly fast even though I had never tried it before. Well, “fast” as in 1½ hours, but I had feared it would take 3-4 hours the first time (which some have said). Sure, I did miss what some of the cards did because of this, and perhaps I should have read the rules first and all of the cards thoroughly, but it was still a very enjoyable game in 90 minutes! 

I was playing against a somewhat experienced player with ~5 games under his belt, but I think I did quite good and wasn’t far from winning. I like that the game definitely seems to reward repeated plays (as you need to understand your own and your opponent’s decks and the combos you can make), but my biggest fear is probably that I, personally, don’t think I am going to play it enough to be truly competitive. The reason is that I have so many other “2 player only” games which I also need/want to play; mainly Commands & Colors: Ancients and Summoner Wars, which both fill the same niche and both play much faster. Oh, and I know that my wife will never want to play Mage Wars, so my main competitor will be my brother who suffers from AP in Summoner Wars – and I know he is going to make much slower decisions in Mage Wars when he has like 80 cards available every turn! So my personal gaming situation wouldn’t allow me to play this game much, so even though I liked it quite a bit the first time and would gladly play it again, I don’t need to own it.

I would imagine that it would be cool to build your own deck, but I simply don’t have the time for this so I’ll just play with the suggested pre-made decks. I liked the various types of cards: equipment, spells, creatures, enchantments etc.! I love that they play out very differently, and the bluff and tension involved about some of the enchantments/traps you put under your mage is awesome. There is less luck involved than in Summoner Wars because you choose which cards to play each round (compared to drawing blindly), but of course, there is still the bluffing (which some may think can be “lucky”) and a lot of rolling dice which can ruin even your best plans! Still, the better player who knows his and his opponent’s decks will win most of the time.

The only reason I've rated this one a 7 is because I haven't totally wrapped my head around the rulebook as yet, which is my own fault.  But, considering how much disdain I usually have for ccg's/lcg's, this is definitely going to be lots of fun.  Very glad I went ahead and dove in.

A game where the designers said, "We don't like the randomness of card draw. Lets make a game where you have access to every card in your deck and you can just choose the cards you want. but then lets add in tons of luck of the dice."

Not a fan at all. Would rather take a deck of cards over a fistful of dice. Also there is no build up. The amount of mana you generate at the start of the game is the same as the amount you generate at the end. There are some cards that will boost the amount you generate so you might go from getting 10 mana a turn to 12. This makes it so you are always starved for mana and you don't feel this climatic build up where you get stronger over time. This is necessarily a bad thing but I didn't care for it at all.

It is also an extremely long game.

A way to play a ccg within the culture of the people I game with these days. I buy the majority of the games and none of my friends are going to go heavy into a tcg/ccg/lcg. But with MWA we've invested in a couple base sets and all the expansions(or most so far, have to get Domination). We have all the cards in binders which we take turns having. 

MWA also has all the super fiddly rules HEAVY thing that I remember from my L5R days, but I've come to realize that part of me missed that fiddliness. We've had some loud disagreements about rules interpretations. This game seems to bring out strong emotions like some games do.

I started with the Force mage(who seemed an extra high level of difficulty herself) but am now rockin a druid deck. Playing Thursday, already excited. There is a masochistic element to Mage Wars in that I know all my carefully laid plans with be torn asunder but the journey is fantastic.

Mage Wars is the better Magic the Gathering, because in MW you can cast any spell in your spellbook when YOU want (if you have the mana). You need not the luck to draw a specific spell as you have always access to your complete spellbook (you only have to choose which 2 spells you want to play this turn).
As the different magic schools are only important during the construction of your spellbook you don't have to waste time during the game -> you can concentrate in winning the game. 
I like the different mages (mostly Forcemaster and Priest) and I also like the idea of maneuvering the card-units in the 3 x 4 arena.
Neither in the Core Set nor in the first expansion (Forcemaster vs. Warlord) are broken cards and almost no cards have erratas until now. The designers of MW have made a very good job.
The only point I don't like is, that some powerful cards are only included 1x in the core set. As those cards are also only 1x in the two Tome-expansions I see no reason to buy those Tome-expansions. If you [like me] buy a second Core Set you also get a second dice-set so you don't have to share the dice during play.

RATING: 2
This game has so much potential.  Turning the traditional CCG deck into a spellbook was an excellent design choice that mostly works out very well to reduce luck.  However, the designers made the critical mistake of adding DICE to the game.  Why would you reduce luck in card draw just to add it back in (in much worse form) with dice?  It's also not as if the dice just get used occasionally.  They are used ALL THE TIME.  Could've been a great game, oh well.

RATING: 9
An amazing card game with so much depth to it because of the spellbook (which is way more than just a gimmick) and how the developers have actual movement within the game, thanks to placing the players inside an arena - on an actual board. There's also a strong, atmospheric feeling to this game, due to such an awesome magic-system where I truly feel like a real mage wielding real power. It all just comes together beautifully and is without a doubt the best mage-themed game I've played.

RATING: 6
Update after first full play (using the other two mages we didn't use in the apprentice game): 
How in the world do I rate this thing? It's the only game where it took like 30 minutes to setup (build the decks), and that was even with following the instructions for the pre-build decks rather than building our own. And then the game took like 5 hours to play, maybe 4 with some downtime removed. But it is a [b]very[/b] rich experience. But I'm still not sure about the idea of choosing from a huge deck of cards every turn. Sometimes my brain just shuts down and refuses to process the choices. And it means for replayability I really [i]have[/i] to get into deck construction, to avoid the same openings every time. I'm not sure I can do that. I'll get at least a few more plays in with the prescribed decks.
---
Preliminary rating after first partial play. A hit with the son, but I fear it's too long for frequent play (we don't have huge blocks of time to dedicate). Chances are high I'm screwing up the rules. There are many possible things to get wrong. I don't quite have the determination to wade through pages and pages of rules questions.

¡Qué pasada! Tengo que jugar más veces (aunque cuesta encontrar tiempo, las partidas son eternas), pero creo que ya puedo decir que es de los mejores juegos de duelo de magos que he jugado nunca. El factor azar es muy grande por los dados, pero un combate sin un poco de azar se hace muy puzzle. Un juego de combate sin dados pierde parte de gracia, y la estrategia a la hora de crear el mazo y elegir los hechizos en el turno, compensan la aletoriedad a la que te someten los dados. Aunque eso no quita que haya turnos en los que los maldigas, como hijos de satanás que son.
La variedad de cartas disponibles para la creación de mazo le da una rejugabilidad enorme, y el hecho de que cada mago tenga una manera completamente diferente de ser usado le da mucha profundidad. Algo sacacuartos, por la facilidad que tiene de ser expandido (que ya se está haciendo), pero por el lado bueno, se añaden más magos y con eso, más maneras de jugar. Muy recomendable a los fans de las batallas mágicas, y de magos en general. Te sientes realmente como un mago en mitad de una pelea, decidiendo cual es el mejor hechizo para la ocasión. Recomendable jugar con reloj de arena, la presión del tiempo límite le da un puntito muy interesante.

This is an excellent game that truly captures the feeling of a one-on-one mage duel. The fact that you have access to your entire spell book at once as opposed to needing to draw your cards and hope you get something useful creates a lot of strategic depth. 

I have only a couple of issues with this game that keep it from a perfect score: 

-Setup and and teardown can be quite involved, and coupled with a long playtime means this one can be difficult to get to the table unless we carve out at least a few hours for it.

-The outcomes of dice rolls can be brutal; a bit less variance here would be welcome as sometimes very powerful cards can be wasted due to poor rolls on the dice, with not a lot of options to mitigate poor rolls. 

Despite these two complaints, I absolutely love this game.

It's merely an "ok" game however. Feels like Magic the Gathering, only with way more options to play (and a much better game overall).

Clear out your schedule for the night, and give Mage Wars a try.  The first play took a LONG time...like double the recommended playing time.  But I can see the second play plus being close to the 90 minutes listed.  I really like the way the cards work within the game.  The stats on the cards worked very.  Part way through the first play the cards get easy to read, and things accelerate.  The theme is great, and it makes the take-that part of the game a lot of fun.  I could see building the spell books being fun also.  Great game.  It would be an 8 or higher if the learning curve would allow getting new players in more easily.  As is, I have to give it a strong 7.

Very fun, takes the Magic idea, adds a board to it, and allows you to play any spell you want. Can be long, especially with more than two, but is always a good time. The layout of the cards is excellent, making it easy to tell at a glance how a spell works. Big issue is that it's a game that really needs to be played a lot to appreciate the options and to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the different mages and spells.  Without a dedicated opponent or two, the game is wasted as an occasional play. Too bad, because it really is quite good.

I really enjoyed this game. It "repairs" one of the major flaws in Magic (the bad draw) by letting you select your cards yourself.

Unfortunately, while it does have an effective remedy for this random chance aspect, it also introduces dice. To me, the dice ruin everything and turn what could have been a very strategic card-based boardgame into a game of luck.

I wish they had at least a deterministic alternative version or something.

The black iron gate screeches as the old rusting metal lifts to reveal what awaits the arena... You emerge from the darkness - disciplined, focused and across the distance, beyond the bones and blood of the weak, you can see your opponent. As your eyes meet it becomes clear that only one will leave this arena. (spells at ready) Now... you begin your campaign to initiate your foe with the fallen. But are you man enough? - - are you MAGE enough?

Awesome Game! Great value in the box - plenty of cards, beautiful artwork, quality components and deep card customization options. Full disclosure/ This game has a moderate learning curve and can play out well beyond the suggested play time, BUT it is very much worth the time investment.

Gameplay is a blast - fun, challenging, balanced and it has a perfect splash of dice randomness. 

Support, support is the order winner - the Mage Wars forums are active and extremely helpful. Play-testers and the game creator engage with the community regularly to answer questions and tease what's to come. The first expansion is out (it's not essential, but FANTASTIC) and brings the total Mage count to six. I could easily see that number doubling between now and the end of 2014.

Fans of MtG, Summoner Wars, Wiz-Wars, and dare I say it... Chess (to an extent) - I highly recommend you give this one a shot. Shout out to Arcane Wonders/ job well done, you've got a masterpiece!

*very* solid game, almost flawless. Magic the Gathering, done right, 20 years after its inception. Seriously: This very much feels like Magic the Gathering, sans Luck of the Draw (something that keeps nagging me in the old Garfield designs: mana/cash shortage or overabundance (unfortunately that even applies to Android Netrunner)), but with randomized combat and positional play. 

Downside is: too many keywords to start a quick game with anyone but a serious gamer. At least, the keywords are quite memorable and many things work the way you expect them to. 

Still, altogether a superb design.

UPDATE - Several more games played now and still enjoying this and very impressed. After initially playing as the Necromancer I have just played a first game as the Forcemaster - a completely different animal and game feel. 

After just a couple of plays I am very impressed. A game dripping in theme with lots of difficult decisions to make every turn.

The dueling mages theme is incredibly well, and richly, realised yet, despite all of the detail, it is still easy to play.

Well produced and pretty reasonably priced for what is in the box(es).

Only 2 slight niggles - I would have preferred things to be environment/scenario based rather than in the arena. And, the lack of variable start conditions and the complete access to your spells might make the game opening a little scripted after a while.

Fantastic game, rating likely to increase.

Think Magic the Gathering for real where the wizards and the monsters move around and attack each other. This coupled with the non-randomness (your whole spellbook is available to you from start) adds a whole new dimension to the game.

The problem is of course that with new players it can totally bog down. Luckily the creators have introduced some apprentice level starter spellbooks to mitigate this. Play with them a couple of times first to get the hang of the game before introducing the full spellbooks.

I haven't even started creating my own spellbooks yet, but someday I will and then the world of Etheria will tremble in fear. FEAR I SAY!

Players are opposing Mages, duelling in an arena.  Large, lavish game where mages alternate taking actions.  Actions can be "full" - slow, powerful actions, or "fast" - quick actions which also allow movement before the action.  The battle takes place on a huge 4x3 square area.  Actions typically involve casting spells, prepared from a "spell book" (basically a CCG card display folder).  Spells come in six or seven categories - attacks, conjugations, creatures, enchantments, and so on.  Mages cast their spells, build up, summon help, and basically go to battle.  Combat is a clean, dice based vs armour affair.  I was quite impressed by this one.  Obviously a lot of thought and development has gone into it, and care taken to get it "right".  It plays very well, looks good, and is well supported by an excellent set of rules.  My only concern is the playing time, which may blow out depending on play style.  Still, easy to record and pack away, and set up again at a later date.  Impressive.

Epic battle between two mages and their summoned familiars, minions, and conjured spells.  Mages can create monsters, summon equipment, shoot lightning bolts at each other, reflect said lightning bolts, cast horrible curses, and much more.  Plays like a grid-based miniatures game, but with cards instead of miniatures.  Unlike similarly-themed games, you do not have a hand of cards;  instead your entire spellbook is available to you the entire game, and you may cast any spell at your disposal - once.

An Excellent Arena style game for 2 players but can be played up to 4. My favorite part of the game is the spellbooks that come with the game to hold all of a Mage's spells. i also like that it is expandable but not collectible you can get more spells and Mages by buying expansions but not by collecting a random set of spells hopeing to get something you want which i personally don't have time for. Great game and great system.

Mage Wars falls into a very unfortunate category for me. I love the idea of the gameplay, the look of everything, the grandiose nature of the box and components. This would be a massive hit with me: if I could play it with someone.

The game is fairly complex, especially when teaching to a newer player. Few are eager to return. If I could have established a regular opponent, perhaps I could have given this game the attention it deserved (and was eager to give it, given I picked up every expansion I could find at the time.)

Mage Wars has a fan base for a reason. The developers have awesome ideas, and they're not afraid to develop them.

Not only this, but the developers have among the best fan service in the industry. Nowhere else are your suggestions and feedback as a consumer as likely to end up being incorporated into a build of the game.

So what is the game? Think of Harry Potter 5, where Voldemort and Dumbledore squared off. There was a sequence of spells like:
-Voldemort creates a snake made of FIRE
-Dumbledore extinguishes said snake by encasing Voldemort in a bubble of water
-Voldemort uses a shockwave to blast open the bubble and smash glass from the windows, and then send the broken glass towards Dumbledore
-Dumbledore turns the glass to sand

Throw in a couple of more creature summoning spells, and that's vaguely what playing Mage Wars feels like. It's probably closest to a miniatures war game, but using cards instead of plastic.

The unique mechanic is that you don't randomly draw cards into your hand. You select two cards per turn from your deck. If you don't use these - they go back into your deck. Suddenly, there's a whole new mechanic of ACTUAL TACTICAL THINKING that goes into hand management, rather than just "didn't get the card I wanted, better draw some more." Further, any killer combos you put in your deck - use 'em! But, your opponent will do the same.

This flexibility comes at a cost: game length. Expect 2 hours on a good day, and that's assuming you've already built your decks.

All said - an excellent game.

I can see rating this game much higher if I were to play it frequently. There's a lot of goodness there, however, my play group tends to play a large number of games infrequently and this, along with may other LCGs/CCGs aren't as appealing if you only play them a couple times a year.

The best aspect of this game is how thematically driven everything is. Sure there are a good chunk of rules, but everything makes sense and integrates fluidly with the action on the board. This is something that other collectible fantasy battle games just do NOT even come close to meeting. Not Magic. Not Summoner Wars. Not Dungeon Command.

A lot of depth here and quite interesting for anyone interested in this genre as there will be plenty of new character expansions. You're a mage (d'uh) with your own spell book that you flip through each turn and pick two spells to play. There are quick spells and long-casting spells and you can do one of each per turn though you have to sacrifice moving to do a long-casting one. The spells are of all different types: defensive, offensive, creatures, enchantments, conjurations, etc. They provide an incredible amount of asymmetry and variability in what you can do. Each character is different (wizard, beast master, etc.) and has a different spell book. And flipping through the spell book to choose what to play gives a great sense of control which was refreshingly different than the usual card game fare. 

The game does seem like a commitment to a system rather than just a buy once and play type of game. You should probably go in expecting to buy further characters and spell books, but assuming you like the game, that's a feature not a flaw. You'll need to find a partner willing to invest in the time to become familiar with the game or else you'll crush everyone and nobody will want to play with you.

I'm not into games like this at all (2P attacky card games with a ton of cards) but for anyone who likes this genre, the design is tight (they spent 5 years playtesting) and it's a must try.

RATING: 6
Very reminiscent of a tactical miniatures game I enjoyed, Confrontation (v3.5, Rackham). Lots of special rules and counter special rules that will have players flipping through reference sheets and debating nuances of game effects. All in all a good game that may take a lot of plays to become manageable.

The deck construction can be a hobby in itself similar to army building in games like WH40K.

It's main appeal is the low cost of entry compared to actual miniatures, but I can see some players or the company itself gradually introducing minis eventually.

It takes up a lot of real estate on your table.

There's plenty of game in the box, and much less expensive than MTG, even as expansions come out.  Play is more 3-dimensional in scope than MTG with movement on board, and dice to resolve combat.  The components, especially the cards, are a work of art.  For anyone into fantasy games (including MTG), a must buy.

Brings back fond memories of my D&D Mini's and  Magic: the Gathering days. The spellbook-drawing mechanic is very cool, yet it can sometimes feel too limiting. Also, the creatures and destruction spells feel a little too similar. The board tends to get WAY too crowded (and it's a HUGE board...)and all the fiddly management becomes exhausting which takes away from the gameplay. I WANT to like this alot more than I actually do.

Arcane Wonders is a rockin' company, and Mage Wars is an amazing game. I love making spellbooks in my spare time and thinking of strategies to beat the various mages.

Love this game. The strategies are wide and diverse. Just started the deck building portion and wow just wow. The options to spec out a book is amazing. 
Length of game may turn some off but I don't know what thematically is superior than this. 
For example...
 I throw a spell to force push the opponents Mage through a vine wall they counter and throw my Mage instead. Flying through the wall I take a ton of damage. My mage is battered and now I am surrounded by his force! 

 It feels so thematic and each choice to pick two spells for the round is such a emotional, critical decision to make mid and late game. You could plan something amazing or your opponent could make you pay with his plan or grave mistake you might of misplayed 

Update:
Played at least a dozen games or more.  Grabbed every expansion and a couple more core boxes.  Easily one of my favorite games!

Still awesome and the deck building is extremely rewarding.  Plus games are down to at least half the time since I started playing!!

RATING: 9.5
Card driven grid combat game. A cross between summoner wars and magic the gathering.

Pros
-Unique (and revolutionary IMO) card game where all the cards in your deck are available to you at once
-Very solid game play, and well thought out use of dice combat (armor blocks attack, but critical rolls ignore armor)
-Unique character classes that have very different abilities and play very differently
-Customizable deck (with thematic point system) appeals to deck builders and TCG players (but pre-designed decks also made available)
-Lots of variety and lots of cards included in game

Cons
-Long game length (2+ hours)
-Can be complicated to learn/teach. Lots of reading as there are many cards in the game
-Lots of use of keywords. A few use of icons that newer players will struggle with initially
-Very detailed game flow (combat alone has something like 7 steps). Need someone familiar with the rules or you must have the rulebook must be kept handy

Mage Wars is neither short, nor simple.

However, the system is easy to understand and well designed. There is a wonderful variety of cards and abilities.

For me, Mage Wars exists as a kind of wish-fulfillment game. When I play it, the theme of two mages locked in a climactic duel is extremely powerful.

Magic the Gathering killer for me (apart from draft of course). Exciting games, always new strategies to try. Can only see this getting better as more cards come out. Recently downgraded from a 10 because there are far too many keywords to remember.

RATING: 10
My favorite game - endless replayability and variety with the choices you have in mages, from those in the base game (Warlock, Wizard, Beastmaster and Priestess) to various expansions (Forcemaster, Warlord, Paladin, Siren, Druid, Necromancer). 

Game Length -- Some find the game too complex - too many keywords/traits, spell choices, strategies - but that's what I enjoy the most. Any question on keywords/traits are easily answered by a quick look at the codex. Plays much faster with two people familiar with the game. First few games may take 3 to 4 hours, but games between experienced mages rarely take longer than 60-75 minutes.

Option for 30 min games -- Highly recommend Mage Wars: Academy version if length/complexity puts you off. It's really like a Mage Wars: Arena-lite version, since it removes the arena (game board) miniatures aspect, which reduces complexity. Mages in Academy also have less life and overall spellbooks shrink from 60-75 cards (Arena) to 25-30 cards (Academy). Average playtime is only about 25-35 minutes!

Luck/Skill Ratio -- There are dice involved in combat but variance is lowered as results are only 0s, 1s, and 2s, but I'd put the luck/skill ratio of the game at about 5%/95%. If you're just getting it for yourself, may be a challenge to get people to learn game with you. If you have 4 people in your playgroup who play, Mage Wars: Arena is an incredibly rewarding, strategic game.

Sort of Magic: The Gathering turned into an LCG, but different. There are lots of things to like in Mage Wars. Freely choosing your spells from your deck is a neat idea (although it can surely bog the game down as long as you're not familiar with the cards). The rules are somewhat lengthy and fiddly, yet if you've played other games of this type, they really are quite intuitive and once you've internalized the most important special abilities don't require looking up all that often. Sure, there still is a noticeable learning curve, but they did a really good job in that department.

Where Mage Wars doesn't convince me is the actual arena battle. It takes quite a bit longer than, say, a duel of Magic, yet doesn't offer a more interesting play experience. On the contrary, it looks to me like the part they concentrated on is the slow war of attrition which is my least favourite part of Magic. Ever so slowly grinding your opponent down just isn't very exciting, and a duel in Mage Wars is bound to go that way. If the battles were shorter and more to the point I'd be more interested.

RATING: 7
Lots of fun if I'm in the mood, but can be very long and tedious if I'm not. It has a good amount of customization and strategic depth. However, the sheer volume of keywords is extremely annoying, especially when new keywords (and associated tokens) are created each expansion.

I played this game a lot when it first came out. I loved that you can prepare your deck of cards and that you have all the cards available to play them at any time. So, no luck of the draw! Cool! There is also a spatial element that was quite new for a card game at the time. The dice rolls are lots of fun (you can even roll 10 dice at a time). I was so into it that I became play tester for the expansions. And a little after that (after the first expansion I worked on) the game started losing its appeal. Instead of being more exciting it became a chore. Play testing is hard. Lots of note taking, session reports, tweeks, card printing and print and playing... I play tested for a couple of expansions and then I quit and never played again. My son still looooves it and continues to play to this day but I unfortunately turned the page. 

It's cool though that my name appears in a couple of rule books and I appreciate the fact that Arcane Wonders approached me and were super professional to work with and very caring about the fans and the franchise. The team at Arcane Wonders rocks! Seriously. 

P.S.: Bryan Pope is the coolest guy in the industry.

Friend of mine brought it over and I thought it looked interesting and thematic.  The spell book gimic was also fun to consider as we have all had a bad hand of cards before.  Unfortunately not only did it not have any starter spell book configurations to start off with, but also the rules were difficult to understand.  Every game I played of it and saw being played there was several bouts of arguing over the rules and the wording.  And the length, I don't mind an hour long game, but it lasts over an hour and a half, two on most occasions, and a 2 on 2 lasted six hours.  Not to mention around that time the four monsters I had on the field had condition tokens on them, one having four different conditions I had to deal with in every clean up.  And that was a game I won, so I'm not making this review because I was a sore loser.

They dropped the ball on this one, it could have been a fun game with a 'spell book' mechanic, but that was reduced to a stupid gimic under a pile of status tokens, confusing status rules, and a long upkeep.

I never played MtG, but if this is what it was trying to do, I can see why people got addicted.

It's possibly the most thematically driven game in my collection (with the exception of Earth Reborn and Shadows of Malice). The tactical decisions I make based on board positioning and the spellbook feel like they carry a logic that isn't dictated so much by the rules as it is by common sense and some level of immersion in the conceits of the game. The rules are there as a jargon framework.

It's really satisfying to play and equally satisfying to compose a deck (spellbook).

The only drawback: it requires two dedicated players of comparable skill.

Shockingly good card/board game hybrid that turns the rules of a card game on its head. Practically every card game ever invented has one thing always in common - random card draw. Here however you're constructed deck is not in a shuffled pile but as a spellbook, which you can flick through and pick cards at will.

This makes the magic in this game FEEL like magic should. You're not sitting there hoping to draw the creature that will win you the game but instead just using that creature exactly when you want to. Anything that can happen will happen and if something has a counter then you can always use that counter. 

Seriously; get this game

RATING: 10
I bought Mage Wars a few months ago and have been playing a few times a week since then. I immediately fell in love with the game and its, so far as I know, unique "spellbook" mechanic. There's lots to love about Mage Wars. It has a deceptively simple set of moving parts that ramp up as the game progresses. The differences between the four types of mages that come in the core set are interesting and present a surprisingly diverse array of strategies. When you combine the different play styles of each mage with the customization options of building your own spellbook for each it all adds up to a game with satisfying variety.

Finally, I have to comment on the real superstar feature of this game that will possibly go unnoticed by some, but will be readily apparent with more experienced gamers. Mage Wars has superb game balance. All of the various spells and abilities "feel" very balanced. When I win it always feels like I have to really try to out-think my opponent, and when I lose I can usually trace it back to a bad decision I made rather than the power of any one spell or ability.

This is not, however, a game for players who suffer from analysis paralysis. The heart of the game is in the planning phase where each player takes turn selecting spells from his or her book. If there is one suggestion I may make it is that players agree to a reasonable time limit for the planning phase. I've found that 2 or 3 minutes ought to get it done. Of course, I would not impose this restriction on a learning game. 

With that said, I have not had much of a problem teaching this game. If you allow the more experienced player the opportunity to go first, and if he or she explains each of the actions he or she is taking clearly, then it should only take 2 or 3 "rounds" before a new player gains a good understanding of what is going on. 

So, if you love wizards and strategy battles then I hope you will give this game a chance.

Magic:the Gathering meets Summoner Wars and is better than either of these. You are a magic user in a contest of cunning and power against the opposing mage. Each turn you will select spells to play from your entire "deck" rather than randomly drawing from a deck and put them into play representing creatures to defend and attack, spells to heal, increase factors or inflict direct damage. This is M:tG with a spacial element or Summoner wars with lots of magic and combos.

The basic rules are quite straight forward and although the added detail is considerable - the rules are very intuitive - top marks! The rule book is very well written and there is a good index of all the spell key-words which constutute the bulk of the game's detail. Icongraphy on the cards is excellent and will become easy to recognise after a few plays.

Components are all excellent overall although I would recommnd sleeving the cards which may be a little thin. The card art is very good.

This game will require an investment of time and interest to play well but if you want an epic game of battles between mages including all of the spell casting, setting up combos, and spacial considerations of a skirmish wargame, plus the meta game of deck building then Mage Wars may just be the game for you. Excellent.

The game is carefully designed and well-executed, it just isn't for me.

The map seems to be more an hindrance than a resource, and having to choose from the entire spellbook can bog it down a little bit.

The company, the designer and the demoers are amazing people, though.

If you love Magic the Gathering, you'll probably adore this!

I love this game. Unabashedly. It's shameful how much I geek-crush on Mage Wars.

I want to play it every time I see it in my library, but it sits there, calling out to me, spell books sitting in a pile on the shelf, and nothing happens. 
Mainly because my son doesn't like it.
In fact, he hates it. 
My daughter isn't into the whole game-geek stuff, so she's a no-go, and the wife?
Forget about it.

You should get a shrink-wrapped person included with this game so you have someone to play it with. This is as nerdy as it gets, and you will have a hard time getting someone to sling spells with you for the several hours it takes to get this game going.

What it offers, however, is sublimely brilliant.

It gives you the opportunity to strategically build a spell book that you will use in the game. You can create this book an hour before you play, or you can create it while you shave the morning before. Or while you're on the bus, or eating diner, or doing any mundane task, because your mind will be spinning away thinking of how you can best combo a fireball spell with acid, so you melt away your opponents armor before you cook him like a brisket.

Creating the spell book is an "out-of-game" activity that will occupy several hours of your life, and you'll love every minute of it. SO. MANY. OPTIONS.
THEN you get to take that book, crackling with blue-tinged potential, into the arena and try it out against a living, breathing, bastard. 
That's right, a bastard. 
Because they will have done the same thing with their spell book, creating a Necromancer who swarms you with poison spitting zombies before you can ever get in position to launch your wall of fire. Or they may have built a "Star Wars" worthy Force-Master, who flings giant boulders at your head, or just backs you into a corner and devastates you with a conjured mallet the size of a Buick.

It's so cool. 

But it's hard. You actually get to feel like a real mage with a book of spells, pulling out every trick just to survive, and survive you must, because this is a last-person standing game. And no one likes to loose.
 
Aside from the difficulty, and the time investment, the only other complaint I have is the status markers. There are A LOT of status markers. Some make creatures more powerful, or cause effects like traps and tripping vines. The board, as large as it is, gets cluttered with cards, and status tokens, and hidden tokens, and blood counters, and damage markers- It can get a little overwhelming. You can also end up in analysis paralysis picking the two cards you're going to use this round, while trying to predict what you opponent will do. 
But that's the beauty of it. You don't know what they will do. They may have brought forbidden magic from other schools, so that cute Beastmaster may suddenly summon an ancient demon to kick your ass, or your ecco-friendly Druid might suddenly teleport right in front of you and beat you to death with her wand. It's all possible, and infinitely satisfying.
Except for that whole "Need another person to play," thing.
That part sucks.

Interesting blend between Magic and Summoner Wars. I had fun playing it even if I lost badly. As for my premature experience I can only say that it could be a tad long, but it is certainly a reasoned game where every move counts. 

As with games of this calibre, knowing your cards as well as those of the adversary is of paramount importance.

Similar feel to Magic.  Takes a lot longer, though, without any more rewarding game play.  Also, I prefer getting screwed by card draw in Magic where I can alter a strategy or end the game quickly compared to the rolling the dice after the fact in Mage Wars(which can ruin a correct strategic choice and/or draw out a game where the outcome was pretty much decided).

[Mage Wars](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/101721/mage-wars): Es un juego para dos jugadores aunque se puede jugar a 4 por equipos. Lo hemos porbado Awell y yo recientemente y hemos realizado 2 partidas por lo que estos comentarios entran en la parte de primeras impresiones.  

**Componentes**  
- Bastante impresionantes, la caja es enorme y trae huecos para futuras expansiones y para poder añadir mas componentes, el tablero y los componentes se ven bastante binen, incluida la calidad de las cartas que trae que no están nada mal teniendo en cuenta que es producción China.

![](http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7400/9559821479_48ae6e3c37.jpg)

**Las Reglas**  
- Las reglas están muy bien estructuradas y son sencillas de entender, de seguir y de consultar, trae incluso unos apéndices y glosarios para poder consultar, todo esto se agradece porque la primera partida suele ser bastante tortuosa.

![](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3830/9562612888_73808f767b.jpg)

**Al Turrón**  
- El tema del juego es simple, somos dos magos que nos damos de hostias, cada uno de una escuela de magia diferente, Cada mago tiene un libro de hechizos que viene a ser un álbum para meter las cartas y es que todo el juego son cartas. Se preseleccionan los hechizos o te construyes el tuyo propio gracias a unas reglas bastante simple y eliges entre las 300 y pico cartas de hechizos que vienen en el juego básico, obviamente la elección del mago marca la escuela de hechizos que vas a seguir principalmente. Obviamente nosotros jugamos con mazos preseleccionados.

- La primera partida fue en modo aprendiz, te dan unos cuantos hechizos, no muchos para que no te hagas la picha un lio y tienes un mago que mas que mago es un aprendiz, no tienes habilidades especiales ni características únicas, se juega en la mitad del tablero y ale. Esta primera partida suele ser algo tediosa y al final uno espera matar al otro mago esperando a que se muera de muerte natural, miras las cartas con cara de estúpido y no sabes que es una conjuración o para que leches puede servir tal o cual carta. Al final, la partida cumple su objetivo, conocer un poco el juego y el personaje que estás usando.  

![](http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5530/9559823661_78acfafb7a.jpg)

- La segunda la jugamos completa con los mazos preseleccionados para los dos personajes que elegimos: Hombre de las bestias Perro Flauta y Sacerdotisa de Berska. La partida fue mucho mas fluida y mas a saco, ya sabiamos lo que hay que hacer y perder el tiempo en este juego es darle oportunidades al contrario para que se fortalezca, el libro de hechizos te permite seleccionar un montón de posibilidades en cada turno desde marcarte una estrategia a intentar reaccionar a un ataque enemigo, cada turno se seleccionan 2 hechizos y se ponen boca abajo, estos son los dos hechizos que vamos a poder jugar por turno, cada criatura incluido nuestro mago tiene la posibilidad de hacer una acción por turno, esta acción puede ser mover y hacer una acción ligera o hacer una acción completa, asi que nuestro mago va a ir invocando criaturas para combatir contra el enemigo y a la vez va a utilizar encantamientos, ataques mágicos, conjuraciones o hechizos para obtener ventaja, el juego es muy narrativo y la verdad es que nos lo pasamos francamente bien.

**Conclusiones de estas primeras impresiones**  
- El juego viene a ser como jugar al Magic en tablero o es lo que tenía que haber sido Sentinels of the Multiverse, en este tienes mucha sensación narrativa y eres un mago que está lanzando hechizos para cepillarse al otro. Es un juego que pide jugar y desarrollar y el libro de hechizos es un puntazo, cada turno te toca ojear y seleccionar los hechizos que vas a lanzar, es muy evocativo. si quereis un juego fantástico y estais dispuestos a invetir el tiempo necesario en aprender y jugarlo porque me da que algunas partidas pueden alargarse al infinito echarle un ojo.

I was very pleasantly surprised by this one. The front-loading seems more daunting than it actually is, ditto for the rules. I have some doubts about balance, but with luck the deck-building compensates for that. 
[EDIT] This can easily degenerate into a slog, which is exactly what I do not want in a game of this ilk.

Joc de combat entre dos mags, que es juga en un taulell dividit per zones. Molt bon joc amb moltísimes possibilitats i amb mecàniques molt llògiques i que funcionen molt bé. El fet d'incloure el taulell li afegeix un element tàctic molt interessant.

Es pot fer una mica llarg, però compensa.

Actualització després de més partides: el joc és molt bò, però requereix dedicar molt temps i tindre un grup de jugadors habituals per poder disfrutarlo completament, similar al que em pasava amb el Netrunner (però sent millor joc el MW). No és un joc per fer una partida de forma casual en absolut!!!

RATING: 6
Mage Wars strong similarities here to Summoner Wars, but the latter fits my style better. Mage Wars is very strongly focused on being a "tournament game". It really encourages you to customize your deck and try to beat your opponents who also own the game. Something like Summoner Wars does a little better job of being pick-up-and-play right out of the box, I think. For example, in Mage Wars, you have a deck of about 25 cards or so, ALL of which you can choose to play at the beginning of the game. (You have a "spell book" instead of a draw pile.) This makes it pretty daunting, but it does seem to reward this obsessive play with good strategic depth in decisions.

The illustrations and components are good quality and the variety and quantity in expansions and supplements is strong. The various decks play rather differently from each other, and provide interesting match-ups. 

At this stage in my life, I play games more casually than competitively and the 2-player battle game genre is a crowded field. Because of that, this game is really not one that I will probably ever purchase, yet I'd be happy to play a few games with someone who doesn't mind a severely outmatched opponent. I think this game will probably always be a niche player, with a core group of rabid fans but largely forgotten or unnoticed by the general gaming public. This kind of game may appeal to you, but be aware you will likely need to find opponents who own and play as much as you do to find it remotely challenging.

Really fun game. Couple of downsides : I know people say that the length is justified, but its not just the length,  this game plays slow.  Cost is too much, plus you may want all the extra cards and expansions.  My wife and I have a lot of fun playing half life... oddly, it doesn't seem to take away from the strategy. Would love to play this competitively if I had the opponents, but now it is just a game we get off the shelf sometimes.

Edit : starting to build more decks and enjoying it even more.  Rating will not go up because of reasons listed above, though.  Getting the (first) expansion has helped.

This is a great game if you are MtG fan or have always fancied yourself as a wizard.  You really get the feel that you are in an arena casting spells and fighting for your life.  There is a learning curve as you will need to know what the spells do in order to build a spell book that you like to play.  The magic mechanic works like you would expect them to if magic were real.  Excellent game.

They are releasing too many expansions.. typical of these days.. "how can I hook people up & get the most money out of each and everyone..?"

It's basically an LCG, and i don't play either LCGs nor TCGs.

__________________

Better than Magic, but at the end of the day.. it's magic.

The two great things wich make it better than magic are:
the area aspect & the spelltome.

area gives the game a more strategic flavour
& the spelltome is just much better than drawing your cards and hoping for the right one.. you can test your strategy the way you planned it.

there is no reason why you should play a deckbuilding game where you draw cards randomly.. waste of time.

I can see why people like or even love it. It's not for me, though. Just too time-consuming. Not a fan of custom deck building.

Man, the "spell book" was so fiddly; way too many icons and special rules; moving the cards (or even stack of cards) with modifiers, tokens and other wooden pieces around on the (pretty bland) board/arena was also clumsy.

Heavy-weight, time- and life-consuming duel game for hardcore board gamers. Not for me.

(03/04/2015) Comment based on one abandoned play.

This is a fascinating and intricate take on Magic: The Gathering, by introducing the spell book concept, and a spatial element through a battle board.

Although we only played Apprentice mode, there were plenty of concepts and rules to absorb, even though both of us were somewhat familiar with MtG. We had to abandon the game after halfway through, where we spent the first hour gearing up and setting up defenses and perimeters. There's plenty to sink one's teeth into here. I am looking forward to catching up on all the action I missed out on when MtG first came out, without spending too much on the collectibles aspect. For now, it's a "7" with room to move up with successive plays.

RATING: 9.5
This is a tough one for me to rate.  After abandoning CCGs in the late 90s partly because of the collectable nature and partly because of the time I spent building decks, I decided that I would not ever return to that type of game, even though they provided rich and enjoyable games.  LCGs came along and promised to remove some of the annoyance, but I held fast.  Summoner Wars introduced the idea of a spacial element to something similar to a LCG, but it did not grab me - even though I specifically liked the lack of an intensive deck building element.  Mage Wars, however, sucked me in after one play with a (very enthusiastic) friend.

I have subsequently wasted much more time that I would care to admit agonising over deck choices.  That said, the limited points system when building decks causes you to focus your strategy which perhaps speeds up the process.  Each mage's unique combination of abilities also help you to make decisions when selecting between cards.

I am generally a dice hater, the total opposite of my dice loving, role-playing former self.  However, Mage Wars adopts a system using D3s (six side dice labled 0, 1, 2 on two sides each) and requires pools of usually 3 to 6 dice to be rolled at a time, so it really minimises the variation from the mean during the course of a game.  Also, each die roll has a mean result of 1 (the sum of the numbers on each face divided by 6) so it is very easy to understand the likely strength of any roll.  So I love the dice system.

Finally, I tend to avoid card games which encapsulate the majority of the rules in the card text because of the time-consuming learning curve.  I tend to prefer board games with clean, predictable systems, with few exceptions, which build tension from players' choices alone.  Somehow, Mage Wars, with its exceptionally clean and intuitive system, and perhaps some small appeal to the fantasy nerd still somewhere inside me, has smashed through that prejudice too.

So, would I recommend it?  Absolutely!  However, I feel as though any rating sitting alongside other games in my collection is a little out of place given the stark contrast with the other games.  After around half a dozen plays I will award it a conservative 9.  We'll see how that lasts!  It may go up, but I fear that I am rating games too highly at the moment...

Update: this has to be a 9.5.  As much as I hate to admit it...  For me, this is the ultimate, streamlined conclusion to the story set in motion by Richard Garfield in the early 90s.  One thing which has become apparent is that it seems impossible to exploit the game systems to yield some sort of technical advantage.  For example, if you dispel your opponent's spell, it will cost you exactly the same amount as it cost them to cast it.  If anything appears to offer the possibility for you to profit in this sort of scenario then there is always an associated risk which has to be judged.  This leaves you, instead, to focus on combining the more qualitative strategies when building a deck - and should prevent expansions from causing "card inflation" in the future.  The attention to detail by the designer in this respect is exemplary.

First Impressions: After 1 round of the "intro" game, we had a lot of fun. Big draw back is the dice (no surprise). I like surprise in a game, and I like dice. But I think this game's dice mechanic strays too far into the realm of 'random chance will turn the game.' Having said that, I do think I didn't play my deck correctly, so the dice were particularly infuriating. I'll have to give it a few more tries before really rendering an opinion. 

Our first play through was extremely long.

How great can be a card game? Well, with Mage Wars you can see it: THIS GREAT! Is not only the cool stuff the box includes ( not only cool, an amount of stuff ). The game system an the feeling that you are playing something new and fresh with a touch of the child's old memories you keep of how great was plating those games that you don't like anymore ( Heroquest I'm looking at you ). I'm really excited about this game and so are my playing group.

A great game and system, just bogged down with unnecessary fiddly-ness and longevity. It is a pretty involved two player game, with as many keywords and idiosyncrasies as Magic The Gathering. Not to mention a huge board to move, about 100 counters and 19 different status effects, just to name a few. A game will take 90-120 minutes, which is pretty long for a two-player game IMO. I loved building spellbooks and finding great strategies with each of the different mages, but it needed much more streamlining.

One thing I hate is some of the decisions Arcane Wonders did with the game itself. I hate small cards in games...but this game could've definitely benefited from it. When you play a monster, the card itself goes on the board. The bad thing is that multiple creatures can be on one tile and will, I repeat, WILL overflow with a wealth of information since there is 10 creatures on one given space. With smaller cards, spaces wouldn't feel so crammed with all the cards. Sadly this would need heavy streamlining to the games system, cause fitting all the texts each card has would be an eyesore to everyone. 

Academy, looks to have all the best parts of Arena, but eliminating all the unnecessary bits and getting straight to the action. Probably the biggest waste of money on my part. Wish I did more research. Live and learn I suppose

This one of the few heavy games I have and its too heavy for me, but i'll still play it if other people want to play it.
I will probably just play with the recommended decks for each mage because I get enough of building decks when I play magic the gathering.

Traded for StarCraft : The Board Game + Brood Wars Expansion Dec-2013
Was really disappointed by this one. On paper, this seemed like such an awesome game! But the truth is it has a steep learning curve and you have to play it often to enjoy it at its full potential. For me it just felt extremely fiddly and too long for what it offered, there are tons of rules and keywords that just suck the fun out of it. Very, very prone to analysis paralysis since you have access to all your deck of cards each turn.

RATING: 3
Many players love this game, but it just doesn't get my dopamine flowing.  I respect that it is a well designed and well produced game that does what it sets out to do exceedingly well.  I prefer Euro games.  Mage Wars is a two player game in which the players assume the role of some fantasy hero locked in deadly combat with the other player's character.  The game consists of playing cards that summon creatures who battle on their master's behalf or casting magic spells that deal damage or heal or do one of a great variety of other effects.  I concede that players have a great number of interesting choices to make, both before the match in composing their spell book and in making strategic plans and tactical battle.  Even with all of the sundry cards that are played, there is much dice rolling / randomness in the combat.  LOL I just can't imagine that rolling a six sided die is representative of swinging a sword and attempting to harm an enemy--sorry ;p

RATING: 7
Pretty interesting game! Love the theme, components and art. The rules are not complicated and make (thematic) sense. It puts you right in the arena of mage vs. mage. 
The spellbook is kind of a double–edged sword for me. It's a very interesting spin on deck-building, always having all the options. However, it made me realise that I really enjoy having a smaller hand size. Ultimately, I don't think I have enough time to really get into another deckbuilder.

RATING: 7
In theory this game is really cool, but playing it feels like a long slog, and there are lots of little "game state" details to manually keep track of. If someone created an electronic version of this game which handled all the markers / upkeep / dice rolling automatically and let players focus on the fun parts (picking spells in the planning phase, and movement / spell casting tactics) this game might move up to a 9.

A heavier Wiz-War. It really, really captures the theme well, and the spells and powers are all more intuitive than most games in this genre.

Really was not big on SW like most and think it is overrated, for me it was 7 at best so I wonder how much of 'that' is going on here.  I do like MTG, sure its not MTG & SW mixed exactly but it sounds closest to that, which does seem interesting, will have to try it to see if all the "added" stuff going on is worth it. 

Edit - Watched the rules video, much more like an improved MTG but inside an arena with movement (the SW element) so this is pretty cool, and yeah, this is definitely the ultimate want-to-be Wizard game, likely at a 9 for me or with more play and no flaws even a 10. Druid expansion looks awesome picking that up

I just read the rulebook. It is long (48 pages) and the game is complex enough for me, there are lots of rules and mechanics to remember which I like :D. The rulebook is very well written and everything makes thematic sense so I don’t foresee a problem with it. This is the game I most want to play right now.

Also the cards´ art is great, I have not seen drawings from R.K. Post since my days of MtG. This is the level of art I expected from Sumonner Wars (which I recently played).

Initial Rating: 8.5 (October 2012)

WOW I’m impressed. One of the best games I have played recently. I have only played it twice in the apprentice mode but I REALLY like what I see. I hope I can play this often if I can find some friends who want play this on a regular basis.

First of all the game appears to be complex but it is very easy to teach. I was able to teach the game under 16 minutes. It is true that the game is designed to flow logically as if magic was real. The components are top notch, the art is GREAT, one of the best I have seen. At first I didn’t want to play with the spell books, but they really add to the atmosphere AND make easy to quickly scan your spells.

The spells are very well done and it appears all the wizards are well balanced. I love the theme and flavor text on the cards.

The only randomness comes from the dice but as you can plan and react to it, it doesn’t really bothers me, it even excites me :D. The combat is simple but fun.

So far I have encountered lots and lots of hard (and great) tactical decisions. As you can only (generally) choose 2 spells each round the decision of what to play is hard. I have only played with pre constructed spell books so I have not yet grasped the strategic facet of the game but I will do it soon.  

I played years and years of MtG and both games have some similarities, but Mage Wars eliminated the random aspects that MtG had. I love it. It also has some similarities with Summoner Wars but the decisions are much more complex so I like Mage Wars a lot more. I would love to have some miniatures for the monsters but the cost would be very high so the cards are ok. I can’t wait to buy the expansions they already announced :).

My only concern so far is the play time. I have heard reports of games that took more than 5 hours. My plays were around the 70 minute mark (but where in apprentice mode). Also if both players are making their decks it can take a long time but I guess it will eventually decrease as the players begin to know the cards.

In conclusion, a game that has the potential to enter my Top Ten Favorite Games list, great gameplay (I didn’t feel any downtime), great art, great game. If you like Fantasy themes and/or Tactical fighting with miniatures give it a shot.

I have played with the Priestess, the Warlock and the Beastmaster and I have played against the Wizard. So far the Warlock is my favorite character and the Priestess the least favorite. My first two games took around 70 minutes but my third game took 3 hours and we were playing with the apprentice mode variant (half the spells, half the arena). 

I DO love Mage Wars, but it can take a long time to play. Furthermore if you have a lot of healing and/or the Wizard´s Voltaic Shield (this doesn’t bother me but it can make the game harder to hit the table).

Can’t wait to play it with the full spell book. Perhaps today :D.

Finally I got to play with the full spellbooks. This game is awesome. So far my games have not taken a lot of time but I’m sure some spell combinations can make for a longer game.

Also, it is great that you can sleeve your cards and they still fit in the spellbook and in the box. In general, when I sleeve my cards (I always do) they don’t fit anymore in the game box. Another relevant point, the game is very well supported with lots of official videos and PDFs.

I always want to play this so I´m giving it a new rating. Mage Wars is now officially in my Top Ten Favorite Games of all time.

I still love Mage Wars. I find it to be an outstanding game and I always want to play it, however doing so has proven hard. The main reason is the steep learning curve with the spell books and the high playtime. I think I need to play with the tournament rules to avoid games that exceed the 3 hour mark. Mage Wars is certainly a lifestyle game, you need to spend a lot of time getting better and I haven’t found many friends willing to do this with me. I will still buy all things Mage Wars and I plan to make an effort to play it more often.

Arcane Wonders have an excellent customer service. I bought Mage Wars: Arena thinking it was a new game, but it was a new edition of the base game and they offered to refund me the money (which I refused). So now I have two base games and all the expansions and promos I could find. 

Having saying all that, I’m still downgrading its rating for the reasons stated. Mage Wars is a game I won’t ever sell, but my desire to play it has decreased a bit during the past year. I still have to try Battlegrounds and Academy.

I bought Mage Wars: Arena thinking it was an expansion for the base game :(. It was a surprise when I realized it was the same game. It came with a battered board, Arcane Wonders sent a new one but that also came battered, then they offered to reimburse for the whole purchase as I had a made a mistake due to the new name of the game and I declined. Their customer service is the best I have seen :D.

I decided to keep the game to make more decks, after all I love Mage Wars and have everything for the game.

I want to love this game, but it's so long and AP prone to rate higher.  I hear it gets smoother and faster with repeated plays, but it's card to find that time to commit.  I would rate it higher but that also makes it a challenge to bring new players into -- even if you prepare their spellbook.  I'd like to try the Academy version to see if that's a better fit for my needs, but haven't picked it up yet.

Magic the board game?  It's a bit fiddly for what it is, especially once units get summoned to the board. The best mechanic is the spell book, which is clever and unique. The rest feels pretty derivative. Magic and Wiz War scratch the same itch, and are better.

RATING: 9
Very enjoyable game, very strategical but with just enough randomness that the players still have to deal with unexpected events without the game feeling chaotic.  None of the spells seem too overpowered and there doesn't appear to be any mechanics in the game that can be exploited too much.

However, despite this meticulous attention to balance, the game still allows for a very flexible playing style.  Players can choose and customise their spell books, meaning that they can refine their strategy between every game.  As a result, the game has a significant amount of longevity.

The only downside is that, to get the most out of the game, you need to find a playing partner who is willing to invest a reasonable amount of time in learning to play and building spell books.  The Mage Wars playing community is still pretty small where I live, and so I don't get to play it as often as I'd like.

Just like Summoner Wars, this game starts out an 8 after the first play. Could very well go up, was fun though it coul have been more tense (Warlock vs Forcemaster). I (FM) got the Lock locked down (pun intended?) pretty well and got a lot of 'smashes' in on him, so he couldn't get as much in on me as he wanted. The designers have clearly played a lot of World of Warcraft. And that is not a bad thing in my book when the excecusion turns out like this. Looking forward to more plays.

EDIT: More plays, still getting better.

Played this for the first time at the 2013 BGG Con and fell in love with it instantly, so much so that I bought it on the spot. Enjoyable game that provides a unique dualing game and mechanic to outdoes most CCGs because you pick your spellbooks and then you don't draw from a neck like normal, instead you select the spells from your entire spellbook each round and hope you have picked correctly to counter your opponent.

RATING: 2
It needs some work on the mechanics...

edit: Played the final copy today... the enchantment mechanic does create some element of surprise.

The problem right now is that the game has a very high learning curve. Because you can play any card at any time, the first game is overwhelming since you have to read through so many cards. This is a very difficult game to just pick and play or introduce to others right away, because they have to read a ton of cards. In drawing card games, you only have to read your hand and go along. In this game, new players have to "prepare" by learning their deck first. My opponent (a Summoner Wars veteran) actually gave up after learning the game because he needed more time to "think about" the cards before playing.

Furthermore, there's just too many keywords to follow. You can have to constantly look in the rulebook to know what your cards do.

Finally, despite all the layers of superfluous complexity, the core of the game is really just dice rolling. There's a lot of abilities but they just seem to be generally good. Because there's no hand/deck management and mana management is simplified, I don't really see how you can develop interesting tricky combos like in Magic, which renders the whole point of having a spellbook ineffective. Plus if you could play a hypothetical killer combo every single game, wouldn't that reduce the re-playability of the game?

I really liked the diversity among the characters and styles.  The idea of having all your spells available to choose from for each turn makes for a very different experience than other card games and the simple positioning/combat mechanics work well.  

Unfortunately, I've had to drop it several points because the balance among the mages appears to be way off.  Wizards seem to be the golden children, possessed of the best spell selection, basic character abilities and familiar (the wizard's tower) in the game.  They are so powerful that if you were serious about being competitive then I'm not sure why you would take any other class.  Another class *may* have the answers to a particular situation - a wizard *will*.

A very well-designed if thinky dueling game with a metric ton of pregame customization options and the novelty of full control of one's spellbook from the first moment to the bitter or beneficent end. It also cleverly combines deck construction with a spatial/board element that increases the complexity and the richness. Expansions seem to build out the experience without significant additional rules overhead or power creep. The downsides? It's a bit--probably more than a bit--too heavy for casual play and benefits from one or more dedicated opponents. Maximal control means potentially extensive preparation as well as in-game paralysis as each move is evaluated. The cards and art are also well done, but aesthetically the game does nothing for me, really. I would definitely play this one more if I had more time to devote to it and I had people with whom to play more regularly. My wife actually quite likes this one, so maybe it will see more time soon.

Deckbuilding and fantasy fighting for 2 players. Beautiful art and good game, but I'd rather play something else.

RATING: 9
The game has a fairly steep learning curve, however, the game has rather intuitive mechanics and interactions. The game is a lot like a chess in the first few turns where each player takes their first few actions setting up their favored strategy and goal, but as the opponent builds their side you will need to adjust accordingly.
But this is where Mage Wars really shines, because while you react to your opponent, your opponent will be reacting to you. And then the concept of tempo and prediction become SO much more important.
I knew the game was a keeper when I decided to protect a vital piece of equipment the moment before an opponent tried to destroy it. Or when I tried to teleport out of a trap only to find my opponent had known I would do that and nullified my teleport.
So you will be building up a system to destroy your opponent while trying to hinder their system, but at the end of the day, the game is won by dice rolls. Which is unfortunate for a game that is so wanting to be heavy strategy, but those are some of the most fun moments when a final blow can turn into a flop or a desperate spell turns into a huge bang against the opponent.
Mage Wars does plenty of great things I have seen before. I have played many table top and card games and you can see a lot of what Mage Wars is doing takes inspiration for that. However, the game does tempo and prediction and anticipation better than pretty much any other single game I have played. This game makes every turn after the first few into a vital decision, and when you end up playing things exactly like you wanted or end up sitting on your spells the whole turn, you will remember and rethink each of those decisions the rest of the day.

I will be honest—much of the fun in this game comes from the simple addition of an all-at-once kind of spellbook. Holding a physical thing and leafing through to select your spells is thrilling and scratches the itch that had been tickling the back of my mind since I bought my first Magic cards in 1997. Never before have I felt as much like a wizard.

Mechanically, too, this is an everything-AND-the-kitchen-sink kind of deal, with a few smart toilets (as an aside, those are actual things now) thrown in for good measure, but it feels remarkably coherent and surprisingly unbloated. It is also delightfully tactile and feels more kinetic than any turn-based board game has a right to be.

Probably the best board game I have ever played. I will gladly play this with 2 or 4 players. The only fault is it's length which tends to result from the depth of the strategy. Some, but not too much dice rolling and no randomized deck, with a huge variety of spellbook-building choices make this my strategy game of choice. Utterly crushes MTG and similar monster summoning "strategy" games.

Believe it or not...this HAS take over Summoner Wars...

The game is so deep...so there will be room for both, but the amount of options, variety in play styles and future promises are staggering.

everything one could want in an epic-feeling duel of mages.

*Absolute custom creation of your spellbook with no luck-of-the-draw.
*You control the mana element, so no mana srewage.
*You can react to what your opponent has done, is doing or is trying to do with your next move/prep phase
*You can hope for a huge roll of the dice to swing the battle back in your direction. And get that awesome feeling of 'Huzzah!'
*You can realistically build many diffeent types of decks whilst they not be limited to that style of deck. Example, you can make a largely "Mana Depletion" spellbook. But, if that strategy fails, or if the ebb and flow of the battle as it unfolds changes your thoughts...you have other things in your deck to get the job done. Some creatures, some attack spells, etc.

There are more points to make; these are but a few of the beautiful things about Mage Wars.



An incredibly simple concept (look through your deck (which is a spellbook) and choose what you want to do this turn) just works so well.

Another geek here wrote the following here: "I love this game - it has all of the best parts of other games - cards with out deck randomization - mana with no mana flood/screw - battle without measuring - creatures without painting - & lots of dice rolling"

This is a concise way to sum up my feelings.  It's just incredible.
It's a a 10. I can give that considering all aspects of the game and universe it's set in.
Gameplay may be a bit long, for some.  But I don't mind investing some time into a great match like this!  Set up, if you want to change Mages out of the spellbooks, or devise a new spellbook from scratch, also takes time, but for some, that adds to the enjoyment!

I am astounded by this companies efforts in the artistic category...for a 1st time product it is AWESOME.  Remember early Magic the Gathering artwork???  A bit on the weak side, for most cards...this one is consistently incredible.
It is quite quality.

Update 11/12.  The more I play, the more I like.  It's astounding how every game is much different from the last match played.  Even using the same spell decks...the reactionary system makes this possible.  Unbelievably good and I will be a customer/player for the loooong, foreseeable future!  Arcane Wonders, congrats and best of luck with this one for the long haul!!!

just another card game following the Magic the Gathering tradition to empty your wallet.

RATING: 7
2015-03-28 - Even more overwhelming than Mage Knight to me. Maybe because I was underprepared to the first game. I'm not able to rate it yet.

2015-04-18 - 6.5 - I think it is a good designed game, but I have some problems with it. Probably I play it wrong way, but most of the time I feel helpless and every turn I have too little time to do what I would like to. For now I found that the most effective tactic for me is to make the mage as strong as possible, which I think is not really the best way to play, while there is so many creatures to summon in the spellbook. It's weird game for me and I felt a little tired after playing it. Perhaps I will give it a shot once or twice and will see what it will be like.

2015-04-25 - 6.5->7 - I played once again and I think that I am slowly getting to know what to do. Still it's a little bit tiring game. A lot of decisions has its effect after some time and it's difficult to react immediately when something happens.

Mage Wars is a singular experience.  The game represents two mages thrown into an arena with nothing but a spellbook.  Thematically, the game pulls you right into their shoes.

I love this game.  It will be in my top 10 for sure.  It has everything you need for a fabulous duel.  My only complaints are that it is a bit too complex for new players, and first-time matches take a bit too long for my liking.  This is a direct result of the fact that players have continuous access to their entire decks of cards, and new players tend to get bogged down in too many options.  This complaint goes away quickly once a player becomes familiar with the decks.  

The game allows almost limitless customization, giving players a chance to build truly unique decks.  The game comes with way more cards than a player will need to build a deck around almost any playstyle.

The game components are great, and the card artwork is top-notch.  I do have some complaints about the box insert -- it does not provide a functional way to store unused cards.  However, this is a more minor problem and should not detract from an otherwise great game.

When Summoner Wars came out there were all these inexplicable (to me) comparisons to Magic: the Gathering that I didn't get. I guess summoning creatures was kind of like Magic, but nothing else about the game was even close. Mage Wars, however, does share a lot with MtG. It has the summoned creatures, but also enchantments, instants, equipment, mana sources, and other things. But it does two very different things. First, there is a grid where your creatures (and self) get all movey and fighty. Second, the spellbooks. MW is like a deck-construction game in which you have access to your whole deck at once, and that's just a great idea, even if it's a bit overwhelming at first. It makes a huge difference.

This sort of game is almost always not for me, but Mage Wars...something about it works for me. This is something I can handle and do okay at unlike, say, Summoner Wars or Dungeon Command, both of which were good games I have no interest in or aptitude for. What MW's difference is, I can't really say, but more plays may reveal it.

the premise of this game is very intriguing to me, but i find the task of assembling decks to play with very taxing - i guess i'm used to MTG where i find the 60 cards i want to use rather than have to calculate out how many cards f which types i can have by points. i think this mechanic will be second nature to Warhammer players and anyone else who routinely plays games where you assemble your playing side by buying units with points. i'm hoping that with the addition of a couple of different types of mages, i will be inspired to play more often.

I've now got a good 10 games in and this game keeps on unlocking so much excellent game play it's amazing! I've played against 3 different opponents and I've got to say that if you've got an equal opponent then the decisions become very tense and very, very meta (which I LOVE!).

However, it's got to be said that there is a very big downside (actually there are 2): 1) first-time players are going to be struck down by AP. It's going to happen even if you streamline the experience. 50+ spells at your fingertips? Of course, AP is going to happen. 2) the first few games take quite a bit longer than games that happen after you've got a few under your belt (and I mean QUITE a bit longer). This can't really be helped but there it is.

I'm really looking forward to the upcoming expansions and while I'm not an expansion nut I have high hopes that these expansions will really continue to grow the game and the overall experience.

No other 'Mage/Wizard' duel game gives me this feeling of actually hurling spells at my opponent. MagicTG never even came close as I always felt like I was just dealing with numbers stacked on numbers. The only other 'card' game that appeals to me in that visceral way is Netrunner and I think that may come from the completely asymmetric game play. I think that this outblasts Summoner Wars as well simply because again, I don't feel like a mage tossing spells and incantations at my opponent, it stills feels like cards. Mage Wars feels real, for whatever that's worth... and for me, that's worth more than just about anything else in a game about conjuring creatures, flinging incantations and fireballs and spells of rot at my opponent.

Rating's going to go up but I really want to see what kind of longevity this has over say a few months of game play before I reassess.

UPDATE (Dec.2012) - I've now got over 50 games under my belt and this game is THE BOMB! Utterly engaging from start to finish, I've even got my wife to start playing and she's really enjoying the experience. This game has found not only a regular rotation amongst my 2-player games but has also become the de facto choice for games night as both me and another gaming friend have convinced the other members to purchase their own copies. We bring our ready-made spellbooks (2) to each games night and go about annihilating each other.

I'm looking forward to the expansion more than I can say for any other game that I own or have owned... ever. This is easily one of my top 5 favorite games. I can't wait until my 7 year-old son can engage in mage combat with his dad in the next few years.

While this system isn't totally no-luck (there's still a 33% chance per die to do no damage), taking the random card play out of the equation is something that's never been done before. 

The sky really is the limit for this system and I see no reason that this won't become a 10 for me.

Update:

Still a good game, but it never became that 10 due to lack of continued support from the publisher, play time, and learning curve which turned off opponents.

Beautiful and brilliantly executed spell casting and combat - perhaps the best board game in this regard.  Very strategic spellbook customization, highly tactical hand management, and chess-like area control. Not a light game.  Weak or lazy players will be crushed.

Really like this game but have a hard time getting to play it because games last from 2 to 4 hours for us.
This is also a game in which I am looking in the rulebook constantly, which would happen less if we played it more.......arrrrggggg.

Excellent fun.

Great cards and other components.

Variety of options at your disposal. Especially when deckbuilding.

Can be a little more static than it suggests (everyone just moving to a space near the middle and rolling dice until one mage loses).

This is a great game that truly gives me the feeling of a mage that wields his magic spells in combat!  I love to build the spell boks, focus on a strategy and pick spells. I like the feel of the game when you throw spells and I think the board and movement is a vital part of the game. 
The only downside is that its a bit complex to get into.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a great game, but is it hindered by its high barrier to entry, in terms of complexity, and the constant stream of new expansions that forces you to update in order to stay competitive. It is these two factors in tandem that will likely doom it, however, for as long as it lasts those who are looking for a complex two player tactical game will find it here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Games always tended to go on far longer than is fun.  Freedom encourages analysis paralysis, and slows a very defensive-possible game down even further.  The randomness of the die can determine the game which otherwise eschews the trappings of randomness.  I'd rather play Summoner Wars.

Would play again.  No chance of re-acquisition.

Played the demo at Gen Con 2011. Love the premise and the mechanics seem solid overall. One of the player options - the Priestess - seems to be terribly unbalanced mechanically. Fortunately, the folks putting on the demo seemed to be aware of this in conversation, and know that it has to become more balanced by the time they release (sometime around June 2012).

RATING: N/A
Very good 2 player game, even the basic deck/spellbook setups offer a lot of variable strategy.  Probably a great idea to have for when only have one other person to play with, with Flash Duel being boring, and Yomi being so expensive.

Bought at CotC 2013 from a FLGS.

Play a lot of MtG now, and really only enjoy move and attack with dice games when they're miniature games, so this space is already filled for me.

Traded here for Kings of Air and Steam, along with the two additional spell books, sets of action markers, and the Elfric's Life Ring Promo Card that Matt gave me at CotC 2013.

RATING: 8
Great flavor-rich game. Fun and generally pretty balanced, so long as players are willing to keep it casual. I have a hard time getting it to the table though: Suffers from rulebook consultation and errata. Also I've seen players get frustrated... Sometimes all the choices leave a sting of fault.

Initial rating which might go up after few plays. This game seems to have a really steep learning curve and our first game took 3 hours with constant rule checking and going through the wast amount of spells. On one hand I really like that you have all your spells at your use right from the beginning, but on the other hand this might cause (at least for me it did) some serious AP.

RATING: 7
Gameplay:
+ extremely rich and very complex, but quite intuitive mechanics, which work perfectly well with the theme; every card does feel like a spell indeed
+ you have access to all cards in your spell book at all times, which reduces randomness and enhances tactical play
+ customizable deck building allows for infinite possible tactics and personal play style

+/- dice decide combat outcome; I don't mind it, in fact I rather like it, since it triggers some more emotions, but some people may not like randomness in this otherwise extremely tactical game

- some rules are very complex and can be overlooked quite easily
- a match can take quite a while, especially if someone turtles
- having access to all cards, can be overwhelming and it can definitely end in analysis paralysis.


Components:
+ high quality components
+ very gorgeous artwork on the cards
+ a good box insert allows for some sorting at least for 2 expansions.

side-note:
if you don't like this game only because it is too long, play Mage Wars Academy. almost the same, but far shorter.

RATING: 8
Mage Wars has quickly risen to be one of my favorite games. Will it stay there? Time will tell. 

The concept of having a spellbook with all the cards in your "deck" available to you is novel and incredibly well thought out. The card art is amazing. It's as good as MtG art. The huge variety of play with different mages, their different play styles, and different spellbooks is dizzying (in a good way). Throw on top of that the option to customize or build a new spellbook from scratch... wow!

The game presents the player with many interesting and purposeful tactical, strategic, and metagame decisions. I liked the game so much after my first session playing it that I immediately bought $100 in expansions.

UPDATE 05/24/15: It seems my love affair with Mage Wars is waning. I like it, but I find myself wanting to play other games more.

I'm a huge fan of Magic the gathering, and wizardish video games.  Also in D&D I always find myself playing the Mage.  That being said, this game kicks @$$!  It makes you feel like a Mage, in an arena, duking it out.  Great art, great concept with the spell books, being able to cast almost anything right away.    Alot of time went into giving the player total freedom, in a balanced way, that makes sense.  If your a more  "passive" gamer you might not enjoy it untill you find your play style.   I watched two people play their very first game, they sat back, built up mana, built up creatures, built up defence, and played themselves bored.  Its a dueling arena, you need to fight to win, and you need a plan.  I've only played 2 games so far, but I can't wait to play again.

Mage Wars 8
Two games are hardly enough to scratch the surface of this one, even if we upgraded the apprentice rules a bit for the second game. What I can say so far is that the apprentice rules are an obvious blessing, allowing an immediate entry into the game with the first duel lasting about an hour instead of the 4+-hours reported by the unlucky folks who jumped in at the deep end.

And while the first game mostly consists of finding your way around the rules, the second one (with 3 spells added to the apprentice spell books and the stats and rules for the individual mages in play), the second one already offered enough variety to allow me to make strategical mistakes instead of rule blunderings. Progress! From what I can say, it’s going to be a steep climb until I can play this fluently, but so far it’s also an enjoyable one. My recommendation would be to concentrate on playing instead of winning; seeing how stuff actually works in play will allow your skill to grow faster than long ponderings over your spell selection every round.

I appreciate very much that the game designers obviously put a lot of thought into the balance of depth and accessability, and I’d say that the managed to hit the sweet spot, at least for me. Since I value content over packaging, I’ll readily forgive the few instances where their lack of experience shows – minor stuff like counters that could be a 6 or a 9, inconsistent use of symbols/text for attack types ... apart from these nits, the game is very polished and seems to have avoided the trap of underdevelopment that so many bright ideas from newcomers tend to fall into.

✔ I see great possibilities in this one! (played only base game)
✔ Everybody can jump into it in 5 minutes
✔ Have all spells accessible eliminates bad luck!
✔ Dice based, it's always fun to attack with dice!

✘ Decbuilding aspect, so its best for every player to have it's own collection.

Too many fiddly rules with the codex to remember everything if you don't play this a few times in a row over a few weeks.

After 10 plays I am done. There is a lot to like, but the game is not a good fit for me. I really wanted to like it and own the whole of everything. But, the unmitigated dice aspect ruins it (for me). Sometimes you roll terrible, no amount of strategy will keep you from losing. Bummer.

Probably a little long for what it is, but still is enjoyable. Has a lot of little modifiers and traits, but the core of the game is very clear and easy to understand. Excellent rulebook also. Card art I would say is fine, not exceptional.

I prefer more strategy and less luck and like Eclipse it has too much luck for my liking.

TLDR: Really good, except everything boils down to dice, which completely ruins the entire thing. If you don't mind that, then highly recommendable.

I really wanted to like this. Played it 4 times in total, each game way too long. To me, the game disguises itself as a very strategy-heavy game. And at first glance, this also seems to be the case. I really like Magic, and the mechanics of Mage Wars really appealed to me. But despite the nice deck building, the nice abilities and mechanics (which are all very nice!), the game just boils down to... dice. You plan, you wait, your opponent walks right into your trap, ha ha, 8 dice in your face! ... 3 damage... And he throws 5 dice and deals 4 damage. *slowclap* So much for so little. So disappointing. If the game didn't have dice, this would be an amazing game. Love everything else about the game. But this one thing just ruins the entire thing.

I liked this more than Summoner Wars for the following reasons:

- Can enhance the abilities of your creatures however you want with enchantments and equipment

What I didn't like:
- Gameplay is much longer. You need to play aggressively to keep the gameplay short. Turtling makes the game drag on forever.
- Lots of keywords to learn

Played the demo at Gen Con, and was lucky enough to pick up one of the scarce copies.

I absolutely love the game.  I was a huge MtG enthusiast when it came put in the early 90's, but eventually stopped playing as it just became too time consuming to keep up with all of the new sets coming out constantly.

This game has the same level of sophistication, and the similar theme really appeals to me in the way that Magic did.

Update: my interest in the game has cooled, and I'm not really sure why. I still think objectively that its one of the best designed games out there, just not one I'm all that excited to play right now. 

Hopefully that will change in the future. 

Update:  Now I know why my interest has cooled.  The game is just bloated with unnecessary rules.  I may sell off my entire collection if Academy proves to be any good.  

My last game of Arena too 2,5 hours, which was just painful.  Arcane Wonders needs to get a handle on this, or Arena will be crushed under its own weight.

The easiest way to describe Mage Wars is a combination of Magic the Gathering meets a tactical D&D miniature game, except there are no random card draws and there are no miniatures. Each round players will select two cards from their spell book and use actions to cast spells or maneuver their mages and conjurations around the board. Custom dice are used to determine the outcome of a fight.

Pros:

+ Finely balanced game-play despite the asymmetrical nature of the game.
+ Love the ability to select your available spells each round instead of random card draws.
+ Custom dice are very fast and easy to calculate. Much easier than most complex games with custom dice.
+ The game just makes sense. Everything is very intuitive, despite the overall complexity.
+ Deck construction is very straight forward and more appealing than CCG/LCG counterparts.
+ Great mix of strategy, tactics, and luck.
+ Each mage is has a unique feel.
 
Cons:

- List of keywords are exhaustive, which will have you referencing the rulebook multiple times throughout the game.
- There is a steep learning curve for playing the game. An experience player will easily crush an inexperience player.
- The numerous expansions reinforce the high barrier to entry.
- Generic fantasy along with generic graphic design.
- Enchantment cards are a little fiddly to use.
- Board spaces become overly crowded with summoned creatures.
- Long for a 2 player game, clocking in around 2 hours.
- Playing the game 2 vs 2 degrades the balance and gameplay drastically. It isn't a real option unless you just have to play Mage Wars.

Final Thoughts:

Rating: 9 / 10: Mage Wars is fantastic. Everything is very intuitive, despite the overall complexity. I find that I'm interested in building new spell books, where I never cared for it in games like Magic the Gathering or Android Netrunner. Mage Wars is the type of game that I am thinking about the next day. What went wrong last game? What did I do right? When can this game get back to the table? I highly recommend Mage Wars.

Wow, this game is really something.  It's a CCG-style game with a substantial tactical combat element that attempts to emulate the feel of dueling mages.  I think it succeeds.  

It is intimidating, in the sense that each player has a "spellbook" (literally a binder full of cards) with dozens of unique cards in at least 6 or 7 major varieties, any one of which often has special power text, and most of which have various special modifier words, which come from a codex of dozens of descriptors.  And, each turn you have access to a huge portion of your spellbook, so the learning curve is a bit steep.  Both of us playing have played many games of this style/complexity before, and in actual play, the complexity wasn't bad, but it's definitely a bit overwhelming.

The game is fun, tactically interesting, and ended up quite even with some interesting exchanges and interactions.  In the end, I think this is a "lifestyle game" though.  The complexity is more of the magnitude of a game like Dungeons & Dragons or Magic: The Gathering, and it seems like it would shine with both players being dedicated to and familiar with the game. I could see this game potentially being very rewarding if one were to make a bit of a "lifestyle" of it.  That said, it was fun even as a one off.

In the end, it's thematic, well-balanced, and extremely complex in a compelling way.

RATING: 7.5
The game length keeps the score down. Also, for some reason I really dislike the two-sided tokens. Not a really big fan of the marketing strategy here, that is pretty similar to what you would find in a typical FFG LCG, that is the composition of the core game's cards. There are certain archetypes that really want to have access to multiple core games. 

However, all the complaints aside, Mage Wars is good fun. It's extremely thematic, has interesting balance, enough depth to last a good time, the expansion have been REALLY good for the game and are what I'd consider "must buy" if you like the game at all. I know I did, at least enough to waste a lot of money on it.

The barrier of entry for this game is very high. I love the spellbook, but amount the choice is almost too much in the first few plays. I played this game 5 times and it never seemed to click for me and my girlfriend. We didn't like the dice combat, the overwhelming amount of cards to choose from, the large amount of status effect that we kept looking up and the length of the game (2 hours+). I traded it away.

I played this game a single time, in ~2014, with my friend Justin at his house in Long Island NY. I was so enamored of the mechanic - you build a physical spell book, as it is a book composed of added spell cards. It nearly requires that one turn into Yugi-oh and shout "YOU JUST ACTIVATED MY TRUMP CARD" each and every play.

I got it when I turned in all my remaining Warhammer 40k stuff to Warzone Matrix in Cleveland, because he had it on the shelves and I remembered thinking it is neat. It also fell into my sad but genuine "it is tough for me to ever get a gaming group together, so 2-player games are preferable" phase.

I hope to someday table this a bunch, but I am neither sure as to when that might be, nor with whom.

Sigh. Magic the Gathering on a board. Dice for combat, but no random card draw. You pick your spells for the turn, and you build your deck beforehand. It's so very appealing to me, but it's not a game that lends itself to casual play. It feels like a lifestyle game and since I'm not willing to forsake all other games for it, it cannot stay. 

Mage Wars makes me miss high school.

RATING: 10
Mage vs. Mage in the arena!  Magic:The Gathering style of card play with a spell book you create and from which you can access any spell at any time.  Can run long, and there is a learning curve when it comes to the definition of terms (stun, fire, etc) in the game.

RATING: 8
Rengeteg kártya. Tényleg.
Sokat játszottunk már vele, kiemelném a pro-t és kontrákat, majd adok egy rövid összegzés.

Pozitívum:
- a téma nagyon jó
- a kártyák és az összes kis tartozék minősége tökéletes
- a játék mechanikája érthető, és nagyon jól működik
- nagyon egyszerű a kipakolás (persze csak miután a varázslókönyv össze lett állítva)
- fordulatos játékmenet, igen erős stratégiával
- nagyon nagyon nagyon kevés random!!!
- az alap dobozzal is rengeteget lehet játszani

Negatívum:
- nagyon nehéz megtanítani a sok kis apró szabály miatt
- vannak olyan helyzetek, ahol egy kártya XY jelölőre hivatkozik, ami nem is létezik. Ilyenkor magadnak raksz rá valamit (legalábbis ezt tanácsolták fórumon), de komolyan... ez egy drága játék, miért nem lehetett belerakni minden jelölőt, ami kellhet?
- Amikor két olyan hero játszik egymás ellen, akik sok kártyával a táblán operálnak, egy idő után átláthatatlan, mi zajlik a táblán. És még a kisebbik baj, mert van, hogy el sem férnek a kártyák a mezőkön, főleg, ha mindenre van rárakva egy kazal enchantment
- azt mondták, ez nem egy LCG fajta, de igazából nagyon is az. Rengeteg pénz kell hozzá, ha követni akarod az összes kiegészítőt

It is a really good game. It makes you feel that you're the mage inside the arena instead of just being a player moving a cardboard mage. I like that you can choose the spells each round. Depending on the mages selected the gameboard can get a little bit chaotic, but the cards are easy to understand. Great 2player game that with a little bit of house ruling can be transformed into a 4 player game.

My rating reflects the unique position that I started with Academy, and decided to seek out the parent game. As much as I thought I would like Arena more, it just feels way more bloated and fiddly than what I wanted with this sort of game. Being able to maneuver around a board is a plus, but it's all a little too much to handle. I prefer Academy for the simplicity, even if the spatial aspect is lost to some degree.

Excellent game.  Took away the randomness of the MTG draw and replaced it with a physical distance element.  Have only used the recommended spell books so far, but I look forward to trying to build my own mages.  The biggest downfall of this game is length, but I think that will reduce with more plays.

I was not expecting much about Mage Wars... and this game took me by surprise.

Since I've played MTG for more years than I can remember, It's difficult for me not to compare them both.

This game excels in the "deck building" department, and It's awesome how summoning creatures turn the game into a strategic combat game. Loved it.

Jan/14: Somehow, after playing Warmachine a couple of times, I decided to get rid of every Mage Wars component I had. Warmachine scratches the same itch MW did, but in a more complete way.

It's essentially Magic: the Gathering played as a miniatures game, and it surpasses Magic as a game about dueling wizards.  Searching through a grimoire for the perfect spell makes me feel more like a wizard than receiving random spells from the top of the library.  The resource system is also vastly improved over Magic's.

Played as Beast Master beginner set vsfire dark warlock and won. Issues huuuge amount of text to read and conditions/key terms. Then there's multiple phases which is annoying to track one by one imo. Also I think I'm not as crazy for more tactical stuff like this anymore though I certainly think there are some fascinating thematic mechanics and cool art and other stuff like casting and spells and enchantments and other things. Decent game but not for me.

Also deck setup and reading is a long time, plus optimally you'd wanna read your opponent's cards - it's a bit much.

RATING: 8
Oof...this is a huge game.  Excellent at representing the details of a duel of mages, but it has so many rules to keep track of while you are playing.

It is intuitive though.  Everything makes thematic sense, but it is not a game to play casually.  It demands commitment from you and your opponent.  

It also requires intimate deck-building, as it's a must to know every card in your spellbook, so you can plan and react to the opponent's ploys in the most effective way.

Update:  This is a time-demanding game and has a huge learning curve for a 1st player that would most likely be handed an already-made spellbook they know nothing about.  I think it is a fantastic evolution of the fantasy battle genre, but its quirkiness makes it difficult to recruit new players and its length time always becomes a factor.

I backed Allegiance on Kickstarter because it looks like it streamlines the concept allowing for more games on my lifetime.

Update 2:  Allegiance is not the Mage Wars killer I thought it would be.  It plays faster but it fails to capture the thematic overabundance of the more complex Mage Wars.

Overall it's probably a great game ... for other people and I can actually see why ... 

but: To me for what it is, it is just too long and to some extend fiddly. 
I can see the appeal of making your own decks/spellbooks, but it's just not for me, I rather play another game than spend a lot of time preparing for one. 
Also the play time itself for a 2 person duell type of game just feels too long and there is maybe even too much going on, which makes it tough to play when you start new or have not played in a while. 
Also the dice rolls to me made this too unpredictable in some cases. 

It's almost a pity, because I think overall I could really like the game, but it just feels like a "high-maintenance" game, which I'm not really convinced enough to commit to. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Mage Wars has become my favourite two player board game. Its depth and complexity gives us a game that is easy to learn to play but challenging to master.

The appeal comes from the Living Card Game model. No longer will the player have to buy endless boosters to find the Darkfenne Hydra he needs for his book, but instead he has what he needs at his fingertips. The deep customisable element of the game makes for new matches every single time. 

Arcane Wonders themselves have impressed me with their level of customer service, I had bought a game expansion that was unplayable and my problem was solved within 24 hours.

This is not just a game but a hobby, one that I spend many hours doing, and has one of the best games communities I have found, online and face to face. I would recommend this to any Board Game Geek!

This one trumps Magic for me. Love that I don't have to rely on luck of the draw and much more thematic since you have the tactics of moving your character and monsters around the arena to attack your opponent. Only downside is it takes a little too long for a direct Magic replacement as games are at least 2 hours and its hard to introduce new people to.

This game has so many cool elements. The Mages all feel very unique and interesting. The various cards all have alot of thought put into them. The game is longer than most of this type but also very rewarding. I think there are so many interesting decisions and there is a really cool risk element. When to push and when to pull back seems important in this in the same way that it does with Epic Duels. I also really like the Spellbook building. I keep a starter spellbook for each Mage to play, but am really hoping some others in the area get into this so that the spellbook building aspect of this game could be explored more.

I really love the "play whatever you want" aspect. It makes for an entirely different deck building and game play experience. I also really like all of the different traits, effects, and aspects to the cards in the game. There's a ton of variety, and it's a lot of fun to experience it all.

I highly recommend Mage Wars, and can't wait to play it next!

Dice for combat is too random, so I play with a variant that reduces the luck factor massively and allows for more tactical play.

RATING: 8
So I'm three games into it so far and I'm liking it! But it's definitely a best-of/worst-of both worlds thing: all the fussiness and precision of a miniatures game, and all the complexity of a CCG-type game.

There's a lot to like here. I like that your full book is available to you and that there's no shuffling or randomness. That's interesting and it's also overwhelming. I like the physicality and dimensionality of the arena. I like the vibe! The spells look and sound like big bad spells, the monsters are interesting. Reminds me a little of the Thunderstone IP.

I do not love that it's so, so fussy. There's no real elegance to any part of the game: it's on you to remember what all needs upkeep, what all gets mana, and so on. There are a million keywords, each with meaningful rules behind them. Three games in and I still haven't memorized the "Codex" of all the little rules and subrules. Lots of subtleties to timing that are gonna be neat once I've figured them out, but will piss me off while I'm figuring them out. 

But there's definitely a lot of game here. I haven't even tried to customize any deck so far. It's all just straight-up starter decks.

RATING: 8
Take every single effect from every card game ever made and jam them all into one game. There, that's Mage Wars. A long rule book hides what's in effect a simple game structure. Each round you take turns to action each of your creatures once, where actioning means move/half attack or don't move/full attack. Of course there are a zillion effects that allow you to break this simple paradigm, and that's the fun of the game, to find interesting combos and ways to take advantage of your effects. In effect a monster CCG all in one box, with big box expansions instead of booster packs, which is what the market was crying out for for years and the LCG's have partially tapped. The question is do you want a 2 player card game going for 90-120 minutes or would you gain more satisfaction from playing more games of its baby brother, Summoner Wars. And do you need another 2 player card game at all? I don't because it doesn't provide anything significantly new, just more and more of similiar mechanics we've seen in other games. But it's still a crackingly solid game for those who have room in their collection for such.

This is a game I was very reluctant to start playing. Since I like variation I play a lot of games very seldom, and always like to learn new games which demands that they are farely easy to get started with. This game need you to know a lot of cards to be able to build a powerful spellbook. Yes of course you can play with the prebuild spellbooks, but how fun is that when everyone you play with have their own? 

Anyway, The other week I was more or less forced to play it with a friend and got hooked. 

It's a really great game. I haven't played it more than twice, both times with my friends spellbooks, so I still have to learn to build my own books. 

First try was a two player game which I lost due to rookie mistakes. 

Second try was a four player game with the Forcemaster vs Warlord expansion. We played teams and me and my friend decided to kill the others of one at a time, which was probably quite boring for the guy we took down first, especially since his partner didn't do much to help.

But still, both two-player and two-against-two were really fun to play, so I had to buy my own copy of the game. 

One thing I don't like is the pricing of expansions. 
if you want it all why buy the two tomes, extra player tokens and two more spellbooks when that is 20-25% more expensive than buying another full core game. The only thing you don't get that way are six duplicate cards: 

Hand of Bim-Shalla,  Jinx, Regrowth Belt, Shift Enchantment and two copies of Purify

and instead of four player colors you get double of red and blue, but a little paint will change that.

Instead you get another 110 cards, double all the tokens, two more playerboards and another gameboard.

RATING: 5
This is a game that demands a lot of study to find the best combos among the cards. It also demand you have a good knowledge of the cards to be able to hold your strategy in memory, otherwise the game will just be a lot of flipping through pages of your spellbook.

A really fun and challenging game - has a steep learning curve, as there are many rules/conditions/traits/cards to memorize. The strategies and aren't trivial either. It's a lot of fun with just the decks as they are but even more fun to work on building your own deck. The combination of magic style creature-summoning/spell-casting and tactical movement on the board is really a superb idea (implemented well by Summoner Wars as well). 
The spell book mechanic is really awesome.

11/13/11 - My second time playing this game in progress. I still feel the same as I did the first time I played it. It's Magic the Gathering in an arena. The rules are still a bit quirky and I would like to see the finished product. Until then the game garners a 5 from me.

Much to digest in the first game. So many cards and a rulebook that feels like a "Choose your own adventure" style book. The game we played was fun, but also a little bit overwhelming. I have to play this more to decide on a vote. The theme and mechanics make this a natural pick for Magic-players.

Rating of 9 based on 3 plays with updated initial spellbooks.  This game has a lot of great tactical decision and each mage's playstyle feels completely unique.  I found myself thinking about how to update spellbooks and make my own not only from turn to turn but even after we had stopped playing.  This game scratches several itches for me.  It is certainly weighty and the time needed can be a little excessive.  Expansions with new cards and new mages are really going to make this baby shine.

Played Mage Wars at Gencon.  Amazing game, with a huge potential.  The spellbook and spell selection mechanic remove the random luck-of-the-draw aspect and allow you to focus on your strategy.  There was a huge waiting list to play the demo game, and Arcane Wonders were set up in the main exhibit hall and board game hall for demos.  This game will be huge!

I dislike spellbook mechanic, which everyone seems to love. I find it very AP-prone and even worse game is repetitive, because of it. Normally in magic style games luck of a draw provides you with different,interesting choices each time you draw your hard. Here you can plan ahead a couple of turns when you build your spellbook. Quickly that was becoming too complex and unfortunately unfun. I think I would like this game very much if it wasn't for the spellbooks.

Still trying to figure out what I think about this one.  The gameplay feels really good and very tactical.  The deckbuilding is something I burned out on with Magic though.  I just don't want to think that hard about what the magic tome should have in it and back in the day (Beta to Unlimited) I was playing tournament magic.  That's just how burned out I am on that mechanism.  

Regardless; with the pre-built spell books the game is super fun.

Been a long time magic player and this is what I have always wanted MTG to be like. The only reason I gave it a 9.5 and not a ten is it has a lot less cards then magic, but after a few expansions this is going to surpass magic in my opinion. The spells book are awesome. The game feels like your really a Mage fighting a battle. Must have for any collection.

It's pretty good! There's a lot of deep thinking involved, but it often goes to waste. Keep it simple and make some big plays.

One of the downsides is that the dice rolling mechanic leaves a lot of the game up to luck. Fortunately, the rolls are fairly predictable and you can compensate by making safe plays for important targets and risky plays when it matters less.

They could probably make this game better just by doubling the damage and life of everything, thus halving the randomness.

Incidentally, this game probably has one of the best rule books ever considering how complex it is.

I guess I've been searching for a good game on wizard v. wizard combat for about 30 years now. It started with one of the first games produced by Games Workshop (Wizard?), which was ok, but plain, and has continued ever since. In Mage Wars I have finally discovered the game that will scratch that itch for me. It's a great combination of  deck-builder and miniatures game, with plenty of depth of play. I rate it an 8 at the moment, but the rating may well rise if it stands up to repeated plays as I expect it too. Great production values too, considering its from a company I don't know. Great job all round, and excellent customer service to boot.

A nearly flawless game that takes everything wonderful from Magic: the Gathering and removes the two big detractors fro the seminal classic CCG: the card chase, and topdecking. The game is deep and action packed, and will always leave you wanting to play again. The only complaint I can find is the game duration, which can exceed 1.5-2 hours depending on the decks being played and the speed of the players, which feels exceptionally long for a 2 player arena game.

My initial play in apprentice mode did not go well for me.  I ran my fully equipped Warlock right into a couple of Tanglevines cast by the insidious Beastmaster, and proceeded to self-nuke myself into oblivion with my Firestorm spell.  

And I loved every minute of it.  It's a little heavy on iconography and keywords, but I found the gameplay tense and compelling.  I imagine the learning curve can be steep for non-gamers, but me and my best friend (both fairly serious gamers) sorted through a full game in around an hour, with minimal rule book checking. 

If I had a complaint, it would be that the core box should come with four spell books and action markers.  I know it would increase the cost of entry, and would likely not be used by the majority of players...HOWEVER, not including them turns this game into a barely tolerable $60 ($45 online) two player game, which is pricey, and probably has scared off a few players.  

But, here's the skinny from my perspective: I really, really like this game, and want to play it more.  My biggest fear is that WANTING to play it might be all that comes from my purchase, rather than actually GETTING to play it.  

Update:  Have now played a second game and am beginning to wonder if the Beastmaster can be beaten.  

Update 2:  Gave it some thought and dropped half a point.  The set up time is prohibitive and although I enjoy it, I can't say I sit around hoping someone asks to play it.

This is a glorious mess of a game that somehow works. It is the very definition of fiddly, what with its complex iconography, multiple statuses, and page-long turn summary, but it all makes sense. Yeah, you got hit with a fireball. It doesn't dissipate in an instant. You're still on fire and take some damage on future turns until it burns out. Your knight in shining armor stands to be fried alive in his metal boots if a lightning bolt heads his way. I love the customizabilty of this out of the box and I foresee this being a long-term hit. The coming expansions will only make it better.

This is my absolute favorite game. It's got movement, cards, dice, planning, trickery, and lot's of fun trash-talk. I can see where the casual gamer might be a bit turned off with all the rules and the required codex- but it shouldn't be anything a veteran gamer can't learn with ease. After one or two games, it sort of all just comes together. My buddies and I play Mage Wars 3 - 4 times a month and can't get enough! 

As for some who are turned off by the time-commitment- that's easy: play a timed game per the tournament rules. The mage with the most life remaining after X time wins the game. 

We were playing X-wing almost every week (and still do on occasion), but after being introduced to Mage Wars four months ago, X-Wing has since been replaced.

One of the best 2 player game period.  Strategy was never so much fun.   Magic deck building will probably always be king for me,  but this one is great for a non ccg.

A sign of a great game is one that keeps you thinking about it well after game play, e.g., Mage Wars.

I've finally got enough plays of this in to actually form an opinion of it, thanks to a guy from my group that enjoys this sort of game as much as I do. My initial impressions of Mage Wars (back when it just known as Mage Wars, sans Arena) were very positive. Epic (and I mean this literally, games can last hours) duels between mages, variable player powers, and your very own customizable spellbook where all of your powers are available to you at any time (because really, that makes a helluva lot more sense than drawing your abilities blind from a deck). What's not to love? Really, not much. I have very little to complain about here besides the length and how awkward spellbook creation (which I hear is ameliorated by an app for this express purpose) and resetting can be (you have to put each of the cards back into the sleeves in your spellbook after a game). Plus, it is very fiddly, flipping over activation markers, remembering to channel on familiars and spawnpoints, adding and removing tokens for damage, mana, status effects, etc. but with that said it all works together very well and once you know what you're doing it is an absolute blast.

Luck is a significant factor in game, you will sometimes be chucking seven or eight dice for an attack and if the dice aren't kind you may find yourself in a very precarious situation, very quickly. This is somewhat alleviated by you being able to pull any of your many tricks out of your hat more-or-less whenever you want. You ready two cards from your spellbook per turn (more if you have a spawnpoint or familiar) and you have to try to anticipate and respond to what you think your opponent is going to do while trying to work your own strategy. Balance keeping creatures on the board, buffing them, debuffing your opponent, and slapping gear on yourself, and your mage is no defenseless slouch him/herself when kitted out in an array of gear; which isn't a bad idea since the goal of the game is to kill your opponent's mage.

There is a very intense and satisfying back and forth. It might [i]look[/i] like you're down and out but with clever play and bit of luck you're right back in it and pressing your advantage. It reminds me of Summoner Wars (yes, I know people hate that comparison, but it's apt) but is far, far more interesting and deep.

Overall this is a fantastic game, I didn't get to play it almost at all for years after my impulsive purchase but this one has legs and I look forward to many plays in the future with this fascinating and engaging system. I'm going to bump the rating for this up to an eight.

Excellent!  Loving this so far.  I don't see this as the kind of boardgame I'd break out to teach newbies, unless they want to really get into this for the long-haul.  There seems to be a long term commitment to this game to get the most out of it.  While the game is intuitive and the traits, actions, abilities, etc. all make sense.  There's alot to digest and it seems like it will take a few plays to really get things gelling.  Once understanding all keywords in the codex has been mastered, then next level seems to be experimenting with creating spellbooks and learning the nuances of each mage.  There seems to be a ton of replayability here and with expansions coming, that potential just increases.  My 8 year old son is loving this and I think this is going to be our go-to game.

I really love this game, but I have trouble finding the time to play full matches with my friends.  The games I have played have been both fun and at times even exciting, yet it seems to drag a little before the true fighting - whether that's due to my or my friend's play-style or an anticipated part of the game, I do not know.  Still a good game even though I have to agree with Zee Garcia of the Dice Tower in that I actually prefer the doled-out cards for what I'm going to have available to play each round to help with analysis paralysis and to ensure people don't just waltz in each game with the same strategies and orders of play every single time.

If Mage Wars had been released a long time ago, I wouldn't have felt the need for a lot of card games I own today. It doesn't do anything new, necessarily, but it does everything right. Having played MTG, Summoner Wars, and even D&D, all the rules just made sense and I was customizing my decks and blasting other mages in no time. In fact, the only complaint I have about Mage Wars is how difficult it is to play with 4 players. I may have to make a custom 4-player arena board.

Overall: Mage Wars is practically a masterpiece. Just a beautiful blend of theme and mechanics. My #1 in this genre.

Takes a couple games to get the card flow down and recognize the decision points. And there are real decisions here - tactical decisions, not just card-play decisions. Summon big monsters versus small monsters. Immediate damage versus long-term effects. Feinting and bluffing. Offence versus defence. Careful maneuver versus desperate lunges. And not nearly as complicated rules-wise as some say.

Looking forward to uncovering the different approaches to getting the upper hand. Rating could easily go up.

Unangefochten meine Nr. 1 der Neuerscheinungen im Jahr 2012 und auch das Spiel, das mich in den vergangenen zweieinhalb Monaten vielleicht nicht ununterbrochen, so doch immer wieder beschäftigt hat. Vorweg: Ich war bisher nie ein großer ‚Deckbuilder‘ vor dem Herrn, zumal ich wenig Interesse (und Geduld) habe, zufällige Synergien (oder deren Ausbleiben) in einer konkreten Spielsituationen auszuprobieren. Eben dies aber ist bei „Mage Wars“ auch gar nicht nötig: Es gibt keinen Zufall mit Blick auf das, was ein Spieler aktiv tun kann (wie bei „Magic: The Gathering“); der Zufall kommt allenfalls bei der Effektivität der Zaubersprüche qua Würfel ins Spiel (und an dieser Effektivität kann man ‚schrauben‘). Auch die Befürchtung, die Kontrahenten würden angesichts der Tatsache, daß sie stets alle ihre Sprüche verfügbar haben, zu lang nachdenken, erwies sich als unbegründet: In den meisten Situationen existiert nur eine überschaubare Anzahl Alternativen. Jedenfalls hat „Mage Wars“ mit seinen durchsichtigen, logischen und - soweit ich sehe – widerspruchsfreien Regeln mich auch jenseits des Spieltisches immer wieder zum Nachdenken veranlaßt: Wie wäre ein Priestess-Build mit im wesentlichen einer starken, aber ‚dunklen‘ Kreatur? Oder ein Wizard-Build, der ganz auf Conjurations setzt? Zwei neue Mages sind als Erweiterung bereits für Anfang 2013 angekündigt. - Absolut empfehlenwert.

I've owned this game for some time and have all the expansions. So I feel I'm able to give a fair review to this.

I love this game. The theme is fabulous, the art work is generally amazing. There's a lot of thought gone into the mechanics. While there is a bit of reading in the manual, it is explained very well and covers cases in detail. This is a deep strategy game that will generally play from 45-120 minutes, depending on the players/mages chosen. (It does say 90 minutes playtime on the box, so I really can't understand people giving a low score because it takes this long to play). The idea of a spellbook where you start the round having the choice from every single one of your spells available is so simple that it's almost revolutionary. 

It's so much fun and the rounds and actions follow how I'd imagine a battle between mages would happen. Like a spell thrown at another creature will hit unless it has some kind of defense, holy healing spells making creatures gain health, evil curses hindering and hurting. Fantastic creatures mixed with commonplace ones will all rise to the defense of the mage as he commands. The variety is there too - if I want an evil Warlock with holy Angels fighting for me, I can have that. Likewise a holy mage summoning demons. You pay extra spellbook costs, but that's the only limitation to building your own deck!

Rather than give a full review here, I'll just add that I think this game is pretty close to perfect for me. I love it, as do all the people I've introduced it to in my playgroup. It's one of the games I never turn down an option to play.

Card based/deck building type game that hides a basic dice roll off and compare rolls type game. As you have all cards available to you from the get go after a few plays you will always be playing the same cards in same order each game. Should have made it that you dealt a few cards and shuffled them back to add some randomness.

Where are the plastic figures and other components that other games now seem to have?

Play time is W A Y to long for a two player game..Avoid

RATING: 9
My first two plays were difficult. I had read the rules, watched tutorials, and played through sample turns against myself, but found the game difficult to explain to my opponent, largely due to the plethora of keywords. This is likely my own failing, since I disregarded the game's recommendations to start with "apprentice mode"

The core of the game seems simple enough, with the only rules that might confuse players being those that concern when quickcast can be used.

Some practical considerations detract from the game. For instance, players may have difficulty fitting multiple enchanted creatures into the same zone on the gameboard.

 If you enjoy Magic: The Gathering or tactical miniatures games, I'm 99.9% sure you'll enjoy Mage Wars.

Cards cards cards cards cards!!! This game has so many cards! And they are all so fun!! I love the idea behind this game, though it looks like another of those competitive card games where you can get really left behind unless you try to keep up. I wish I had someone to play this with.

Theme is great. I love that the different characters play very differently, especially with their deck makeups.

I wanted to love this and it has a bunch of really cool aspects but at the end of the day if I am being really honest with myself, this type of game just doesn't do it for me much anymore. I don't want to build a "deck". I don't want direct confrontation. Oh well.

Seemed unnecessarily complex for what it accomplished. It was too long for the fun it offered, and it is prone to stalemate positions and AP. It had great components, but I didn't feel like there was really that much going for the game. Plus, this game is expected to be very expensive, and the obligatory expansions will only make it worse.

RATING: 8
A very good game indeed. It can really conjure up the image of dueling mages. 
I like that there are many ways to play whether you like to summon a horde of undead monsters or you prefer a nearly invincible warrior clad in iron or perhaps like to teleport around the arena attacking your enemy where he is weakest with fireballs and lightning strikes, the tools are there - at least if you buy the expansions.

There is some luck in the dice, but since it will on average take more than 6 dice to kill an unprotected mage - and much more if he wears armour, the luck tends to even out quite rapidly. Also, there are ways to mitigate the luck, like curses that are not dependent upon dice or choosing the right target for your attack.

All in all there is a lot of direct interaction and a lot of decission making. It is also a bit of a life-style game in that it does require frequent plays and to get the most out of it one will also need to spend time on it while not playing.

A friend and I can usually get two games in of this during a single evening - after the kids have been put to bed but before we ourselves need to turn in. So slightly more than 1 hour per game. And those few games that last longer are usually all the more exciting for it.

RATING: 8.5
20-01-2014. Apparently I never commented on MageWars (MW), but I have graded it.

MW is a game in which everyone selects a summoner, builds (or in my case takes) a spellbook. You then proceed to gather resources, cast spells, maneuver tactically on the board while bombarding your opponent with spells and creatures. 
Interesting twist on the Summoner versus Summoner theme, by having you select cards from your spellbook eliminating the luck of the draw.

I really, really enjoy the game. For me, the biggest downside is the duration of the game. I haven't played games that lasted under 90 minutes and most have lasted 120 to 150 minutes. For a two-player game, how challenging and interesting as it might be.. that makes it hard to get to the table.

MtG/ StarWars and Android Netrunner play in 20-30 minutes per game. This is ideal for a 2 player game. MageWars is the epic variant, and while I love the game I cannot whip it out as often as I'd like.

[Edited this review to reflect MW: Arena without expansions]

Pros: Better production values and cost compared to FFG's LCGs. Extensive deck building possibilities. Terrific artwork.

Cons: The highly vaunted spell book mechanic and flat resource curve are as much as a bug as they are a feature. Leads to repetitive and exhaustingly long games. No hand management or meta skill; just a game of trading nukes (some cards are literally hard counters to others).  Spatial elements are not utilized well and clunky (Domination fixes this issue a bit). No good mitigation of the actual RNG element (dice, which are required to offset the lack of card variance) outside of rerolls which are terrible. 

Basically a game that tries to be too many things and is beloved by terrible TCG players who blame their failures on card draw, resource screw, and inability to manage their hand in-game. Sorry, but complexity does not equal depth.

RATING: 8.2
positives:

Two elements of the game are unique and never find it in other games i've played.
First of all , you dont have to wait to draw the card you want like all other games, you just simply pay (if you have mana) and take it in your hand! 
Secondly you build your own spellbook (you have a limit amound of money 120) just think how deep is that, if something doesnt go right for you in the battle, you can modify your spellbook in the next game! 

The game has very deep strategic desicions as you choose in most cases only 2 cards each round of your spellbook.

Negatives:
The serious drawback of the game is that the game is overloaded with many many rules and codex, and this has serious impact on the game duration, which definetely is not 90 minutes, about 180 minutes is usually the game time and sometimes higher, and secondly there is a change you miss something to see in the rules or forget it at that time and suddenly your strategy goes in the trash! 

It's a great game but needs dedicated players :)

I REALLY wanted to like this and I appreciate what this game is trying to accomplish but I've found that this game is much too complex to introduce to a casual gamer. Or to play in a casual capacity. Requires a degree of game familiarity beyond what I'm prepared to adopt.

Tried to have a go with the apprentice rule and gave up trying to locate spell clarifications in the manual. And this is AFTER watching the tutorial videos.

Conclusion - purchase only if you and game partner are prepared to invest in this or are willing to participate in a tournament circuit (assuming such a thing exists)

RATING: 7.5
Has a very similar feel to Summoner Wars with the caveat being that you have your entire deck available to you the entire time.  But it still has many of the same mechanics the SW employs.  The deck building aspect is a bit more prevalent with Mage Wars, I think, but I guess that would depend on how many mercs you use with SW. Component wise, the cards have more info on them than their SW counterparts which elevates the learning curve a bit.  Overall, though, this is a keeper and does have enough to differentiate it from Summoner Wars.

I won my copy of Mage Wars Arena at GenCon because I demo'd so many Arcane Wonders games, and they were all fantastic! I picked up all of the expansions (with a slight hiccup) and can't wait to get more of my friends to play a game that has such subtle nuance. Even though one of my expansions was missing some cards, Alfiya Pope at Arcane Wonders sent me everything in less than four total days(including a weekend)! Such fast service is commendable, I can't recommend this game or Arcane Wonders enough. :)

Mage Wars Arena is an absurdly deep experience, though not nearly as daunting as it looks on the front end. I would like the game even more if it didn't lean so heavily on standard fantasy gaming tropes, but in its current form it is still a deep and engaging dueling game.

As a side note, this is probably one of the fullest "core set" releases out there. Aside from the depth of the system itself and the game left to explore with standard spellbooks, there are a ton of cards for deckbuilding right in the box. You could conceivably dig around the core set for a good long time without ever needing to expand it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The coolness factor of this game is off the charts.  Playing spells from a spellbook instead of a deck is very satisfying.  I believe the game is fantastic, but haven't had much chance to play; there's a considerable barrier to entry.  To get the most out of this, you need a level of involvement from players that is similar to a CCG; they need to take the time to build their spellbook, which means learning a very large pool of fairly complex cards and the mechanics involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun, thematic, challenging, a great game.  I don't give it a ten because it takes forever and the barrier to entry is huge, but if I have a few hours to waste and a person that knows how to play, it's a great experience.  I would recommend it for anyone who can find a regular game partner, not worth the money if you can't.

My rating is based on a single play so take it for what it is worth. The game was fun enough, but ultimately just took too long for what it gave in return.

Initial impression.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is the coolest idea for an LCG I've ever heard of. I like the idea of having access to your spells whenever you want, and having to pick them at the start of the turn, before seeing what your opponent chooses, adds just the right amount of uncertainty. I like the uncertainty added by the damage dice and effect die, and I rarely feel like a game is determined by the dice. This from someone that usually dislikes dice combat resolution systems. I also appreciate the different mage abilities and schools of magic. It adds a nice amount of asymmetry to the game even before taking into account your individual spell choices. 

----------------------

Mage Wars is an incredible game, but there are a few problems with it.

The two biggest problems are the barrier to entry and the card distribution. There is a bit of a learning cliff to Mage Wars. I expect it to take about 30 games to really learn the game well enough to be playing competently. If you can play the game in 30-90 minutes, that's still a fairly significant time investment, but it gets a lot worse if you play slowly. There are plenty of people that cite 4 hour game times. Once you know what you're doing, you should be able to play 3+ games in that amount of time, but particularly if you don't have an experienced player teaching the game, the first few games can be quite long. This makes teaching new players, and finding new players willing to commit to learning the system extremely challenging and tedious if you don't already have a community built up around the game.

The card distribution in the core set is kind of awful. Later expansions do a better job of it, but it still suffers from a distribution model standpoint. Because Mage Wars has adopted an LCG style model, the game is becoming progressively more expensive to get into, which makes it less and less attractive to new players just from a cost standpoint. In addition, there are some cards that are incredibly important, and you'll want to run in virtually every spellbook (Acid Ball), and others that are borderline useless (Sardonyx). For those that want to be able to run more than one spellbook, there is no good, efficient way to get enough copies of the cards that they actually need multiple copies of without getting piles of cards they'll never use. 

All of that said, Mage Wars is an incredible game if you can find someone to play it with on a regular basis.

A really nice custom game. I love all the possibilities it offers to you.

However, once you get into it, the game tends to be very long. The creation of the spellbooks also take a huge amount of time.

Excelent game, the only downside is the length.
Even though I've only payed aprentice games, each game can easily last an hour, although it should shorten up as we gain experience. This issue will probably prevent me to play as much as I'd like.

The game is quite fast paced as each player has many turns during a round and the longest "idle time" is during planning, but if both players take around the same time to plan their strategies, is not an issue.

There is another minor issue with the game and is the size. as the board is fairly large(although it can be cluttered with ease) it's hard to carry, it could prove an issue if you are promoting the game with your friends unless you don't mind playin on "alternative" borads (Like printed paper)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
If only this thing would unpack itself. A fine card game with board. It is fun to play a board and card game with this level of customization. I like the flavor of the cards in it as well. The issue we run into is its running time due to tutoring several cards each turn and the time it takes to unpack. Sadly, this game does not play really well with three players, our regular number. It is at its core a 1 on 1 game.

I cannot do this game justice at this time. More plays before comments exist.

Mage Wars is an excellent game with a great production value. It combines the best elements of strategic board gaming and deckbuilding, while remaining total flexible and players are always in control of their actions and resources. Even the inclusion of dice do not make chance/randomness a decisive factor in Mage Wars.
Only down sides that made me not give it a 10 is that Mage Wars is not very transportable (heavy big box + large playing board), has a steep learning curve and is prone to AP.

Played the full game and wow.  Just wow.  Still waiting to see if this game grabs the group and can really be explored.  Theme and fun that's all anyone needs to know.

Played 1x with 4P: Let me preface my rating by saying I did enjoy the game. 

With 4, imho, you need to play teams 2 vs 2 and play to first mage kill.  If you tried to play every man for himself, the game would take forever.  Our game took over 4 hours and only 1 mage was killed and that was because of a 2 on 1 assault.  With 4 players, 2 on 2 teams, my rating would probably be a 6.5.  

There is a learning curve to this based on a ton of "stuff", icons, and regulations about who can hit what.  Throw in the organization of decks, and creation of decks -- it's a campaign.  Can't see a 4P game of this coming close to finishing in 90 minutes.

Summoner Wars gémereknek. Röviden ez a Mage Wars. Kicsit csökkentették a pályát és adtak a játékhoz pár 10 tokent, had örüljön a jónép. A játékosok itt egy-egy varázslót irányítanak, akivel szinte bármit lehet csinálni. Lényeket, felszerelési tárgyakat idézni. Célpontra, területre ható varázslatokat létrehozni, falakat emelni és különböző erősítő vagy gyengítő dolgokat rakni egy-egy megidézettre. Itt nem keverednek a lapok, hanem egy könyvben helyezkednek el és körönként kettőt lehet belőlük játékba hozni. Nagyobb a szabadság ennek a könyvnek a létrehozásában és az egész játékmenetben. Rengeteg lehetőség, magas újrajátszhatóság és gyönyörű játékelemek jellemzik. Nem csoda a sikere. Akiknek a Summoner Wars nem ad elég szabadságot, illetve bonyolultabb játékmenetre vágyik, annak tökéletes választás. Én azonban maradok az SW mellett, mert nekem az úgy tökéletes, ahogy van.

File this under "supremely cool game that is basically unfinished because it is way too complex in its current state and needed to be reined in a bit"

The analysis paralysis is insane (the spell book mechanic basically means your whole deck is your hand), there are way too many effects and keywords to remember or constantly refer to, and the game length is much too long for a competitive duel game.

If those things were dealt with, this would be very,very  highly rated

I really love this game - the only downside is that it is a long game.  The few games I have played all seem to take a couple of hours or so to play whereas SUmmoner Wars is about 30 minutes to play.  

I found some of the factions more difficult to play than others and one in particular I could not get a handle on at all ... So my recommendation would be if you are trying to introduce someone to this or playing it for the first time, to be very careful in selecting the starting mages.

Well the glow finally burnt off this game for me - I had it ranked as an 8.3 but downgraded it due to the infrequency of my thinking about playing this.  While it should provide an Epic experience based on how long it plays, it comes up short in it's attempt.  I hope we will still play occasionally but it is now swinging out of major rotation.

1 play, prototype, demo game, Origins 2011

The basic concept reminded me of Summoner Wars (which I'd gotten a partial demo of last year, but never played otherwise; but I just traded for a copy of all previous releases -- should be winging its way to me right now):
- each player is a Mage (Summoner) of a different type
- you play on a board with your character represented by a card
- you summon other cards to the board
- everything moves and attacks each other
- you win by killing the other player's main character

Of course, much of the above is true for other games as well. There are also many differences between these games (at least, what I vaguely remember about Summoner Wars). And they were just demoing a very basic version of the game -- there is apparently a lot more to it! Some differences:
- board shows zones (intro game is a 3x2 grid), not individual spaces; movement and spell effects is by zone
- bigger variety of available cards: creatures, spells, enchantments, equipment
- here, you have your entire spell book (a physical book, with slots for all your spell cards) from which to choose each turn; at the start of each turn, select 2 to have available that turn; uncast ones go back to spell book while the cast ones are discarded
- everything on the board acts each turn

Mage Wars felt sort of like a miniatures-type combat game, in the Magic: the Gathering type of universe and played with cards! Or like a combat real time video game brought to the board: you're in an arena, you earn mana at a steady rate, you get to choose what to cast each turn rather than depending on the luck of the draw, all your monsters are moving around and acting at the same time, yet you don't have to worry about some minutiae (like exact movement, ranges, line of sight) thanks to the zone system.

The demo game was already set up -- specific main characters and spellbooks -- but I suspect you could build your own spellbook (maybe to a specific total point value) ... great for the CCG player in you! Also, the board was a simple 3x2 grid; there's room to change or expand the play area and add terrain effects as well. And, of course, there can be a ton of variety in creature strengths and abilities. The game has huge potential!

I am not a particularly good tactician; in fact, I think I'm downright awful! But I still had a lot of fun with this one!

--- Summary (prototype, demo game) ---
Each player picks a different starting character and matching spellbook. Place the card in opposite corners of the board. These show how much mana you generate each turn, and your characteristics (cast a spell, attack dice, HP). Random player gets initiative marker: holder goes first.

Each round, players simultaneously untap (actually, you flip a marker) all their creatures. Add mana to your mana pool. Resolve Upkeep effects, if any. Choose which 2 spells to place in your hand this turn. Then, players alternately activate a creature on the board to use its ability (move -- most move 1 zone, attack ranged or melee, possibly other abilities); that taps (inactivates) the creature. Players also have the opportunity to take one action (fast spell) in addition to, or instead of, one of their other actions that round. If you pass, you're out for the rest of the round. When combat occurs, roll the specified number of dice: these show 0-2 hits, some with a starburst -- the targets shields/armor are deducted from the non-starburst hits, then the sum is inflicted onto the target. Some hits inflict additional effects (e.g., possibility of setting target on fire!). Continue this way until one player has taken maximum damage and loses!

Basic rules are nice and simple -- the difficulty comes from the tactical choices to be made. It's hard for me to give a good evaluation since I suck so badly at these games, but I'd love to try this again (before next year!).

RATING: 10
I adore this game.  I knew I would before I even got my copy and was even more so sure before I ever played it just as I was reading through the rules and card text.  As a former Magic: The Gathering and other assorted CCG lover I go absolutely giddy for this kind of stuff.  But finally playing it has put the nail in the coffin, this game is outstanding!

Many other players have compared this game to Summoner Wars and that is a fair baseline but I am head over heals for Mage Wars and only lukewarm toward Summoner Wars.  Both games feature playing cards onto a map of sorts attempting to destroy the other player's "leader" and feature a similar combat system.  But, as the saying goes, the devil is in the details.

I am all about depth and variety in my games, especially ones I purchase and Mage Wars blew me out of the water in this respect, especially when compared to Summoner Wars.  With just 4 different mages (and 2 more on the way in an imminent expansion) the customizability of your spell book gives a player almost unlimited options.  Each player has a certain number of "points" to spend on their spell book and pays more for spells outside of their magical "focus" but aside from these restrictions (and a couple spells that are mage-specific) you can put ANY spell in the game in your spell book.  This means you can play the same two mages against each other countless times and never feel like two games are the same.  Certainly, some mages excel at certain strategies and tactics but just having that kind of control over your deck is very attractive to me.

I've always been a little disappointed by the LCG's available coming from a background of Magic since the depth of the games seems lack-luster compared to the mechanic-rich 20-year history of Magic.  Mage Wars is the first that doesn't feel like it pales too much in comparison though.  It's certainly no Magic: the Gathering but there is a glossary of different mechanics and conditions that form a nice cohesive web that works well together and presents a good number of strategies, combos, and play-styles out-of-box.

I also love the mechanic, the first I've played in this way, of giving you access to your entire deck library from the start of the game.  There is no luck of the draw, just management of your resources, actions, and board position.  This can make the game overwhelming to new players who don't know yet the different cards and how they interact with one another and that is probably my biggest (and only) complaint with the game.  It has a steep learning curve if only because of the things I love most about the game (its depth and variety).

This is one of my new favorite games and I will be looking to play it as often as possible.

Nice Game, but after playing it several times i have to say the game is not very strategic and compared to "Magic - the Gathering" i prefer "Magic". The options and the different Spells are not so different to each other.
But nevertheless it is a good game for 2 persons, maybe more for teenagers.

Impossible to teach to new players (they literally have to read through more than 100 cards before able to play properly). Also since every card in your deck is available at all times you spend an afternoon constructing the best deck possible and just repeat your moves game after game. If you even remotely played any TCG competitively and understand how these games work avoid Mage Wars at all cost.

Mage Wars is the best game that I have ever demoed.  It was easy to learn how to play, but has many level of strategy.  So I could see myself playing it over and over and still loving it.

It's 2-player only, with a significant learning curve.  I probably wouldn't give this a 10 except that I've got a regular opponent now.  We play every week, we've started building our own spellbooks, and it's freaking awesome.  Lots of second-guessing, lots of viable paths to victory (swarm, a few heavies, solo mage, mana denial, heavy cursing . . .)

UPDATE: With my opponent having moved away, I unloaded this one.  It's still a great game.

A little bit of Magic, Yugioh, Heroclix, and Summoner Wars all mixed into a pot and producing something wonderful. I realize its not really fair to just compare it to all of those games, but the game seems to take the parts of many different games that work well, and makes them work even better. The only reason I didn't give this game a 10, is you definitely need somebody else to get into it with you, or you won't get the same mileage out of it.

Does it live up to the hype?  Yes.  It is a blend of skirmish and collectable card games.  It is flawless.  One of the best games ever made.  There is plenty in the box to play for a long time, so you don't need any expansion material and don't listen to people who say that you do.  However, my guess is that you will want the expansion material.

Primarily a 2 player game, no matter what the box says.  The only two player experience that can match it is War of the Ring in my opinion.

woow.. fantastic ..playing on some regular basis is so satisfying.
It's all thematic, deep and comboable, there's a fair share of strategy vs tactics, the 'deck build' + 'deck use' together make such a sense! (Drawdecks, I curse you!) ..beautiful approaches on arena dueling. No objection on components but the fact, that the map is soo huge even if folded up. 
Artwork is stunning ..and community/customers support: hats down and thank you!

E: the rating of my own is rising.. it's a total blast in 2vs2 play mode!!)

E: soo cool game.. Unfortunately not for me :( .. I couldn't find that time/energy needed for proper deckbuild that is at least 1/2 of the whole case..

This is the game that I've been looking for since forever. It makes all the problem of Magic right.

The best feature is the lack of card drawing. This is the best simulation of a magic duel ever.

Unfortunately the game is too long. No, not because of rules question or lack of experience. That's how the game works. A normal game last around 1,5 hours. I would like a game like this to last no more than 45 minutes. While I still think the game is great it doesn't get too much play because of the length.

My rating is what I *assume* the game would earn if I had enough opportunity to really get into it.

And therein lies the only *real* problem I see with this game. It's a borderline "lifestyle" game. I don't see it really working as game you pull out now-and-then to play with your friends who also play it now-and-then. I think it can only be truly rewarding if you devote considerable time to the game AND have at least one opponent willing to do the same.  Bit of a heartbreaker for me because I'm not likely to fall into that category.

Not much of a 2-player game fan. I have tried this with 4 people but it is VERY slow.

The main problem I have with the game is the sheer number of book keeping and decisions to go through. The concept is awesome and I love the ability to select whatever spell you want, but it also bogs the game down heavily.

Not really my favorite interest, but I can definitely appreciate it.

Decent game, there are a TON of Keywords you have to constantly look up. Also, teaching yourself this game is a HUGE task and requires a good amount of time for you and your opponent to go through the cards and spellbooks. Maybe if I had more time to dedicate to just this one game, it could become a hobby, but until I am retired, probably too much dedication to this one game is needed.

RATING: 6
Seems like a well designed game. Can't comment on the rules as I didn't have to learn them from the book. It lasted far too long with 3 new players (4 hours) and that was with one team rushing to end it. I'm not sure I liked all the build up before the action started but with only a single 4 player game it is too early to really say. There seems to be plenty going on and that's likely to only get worse as more expansions are released. Combined with the deck building this may be a bridge too far (for me as a casual player who doesn't find the theme very interesting) but for the target audience it should be a hit. 

The art is of the usual gaudy digital style that is completely unsuited to fantasy art but inexplicably remains the go-to choice. This will be the only time you'll hear me say it but, "I wish they would bring back the 80s." Still the work itself is of high quality and bar the backwards spellbook slips so is the production.

RATING: 10
First play (pre-made Beastmaster vs Warlock): Played a couple of rules wrong but it still was a great game. Had to explain first (took 1 hour to do properly) and abandoned after 2 hours due to time limitations but we both were wanting to go on.

Second play (pre-made Wizard vs Priest): We abandoned the game after a 3 hour matchup, having only 6 damage my Wizard and almost none on the Priest. While playing it was very enjoyable, it was thoroughly unsatisfying to leave the game unfinished. We also recognized the game would not go anywhere for at least another hour so stopping was in itself not that bad. Used a tactic of extreme turtling, btw.

Third play: (pre-made Warlock vs Priest): Used different playstyle, a bit more aggressive and BAM! What a great game. Clocked in at 1hr45min with my Warlock only 1 life remaining. All came down to the last dice-roll.

So, this game is all about how you play. As a 'blue' MTG player, I used to focus on the meta-game, controlling that first and then slowly killing my opponent off. Fun for me, not that fun for my opponents sometimes. In this game, it is paramount you put pressure on the other guy, and do it better than he can counter it. Gameplay hugely improves after some games as you better understand the flow of the game.

Don't be afraid to put down a big creature early. Big creatures don't go down as fast as in MtG (no Terror/Sword to Plowshares or other similars here). And don't be afraid to use those direct damage spells early on.

The main risk by which this game falls flat for 'new' players is usually not in the complexity of the rules (though yes, they can be daunting at first), nor the play-experience itself (which is great) but in the duration of this experience.

Suggested for first play: Pre-made Apprentice Warlock vs Apprentice Beastmaster (see Arcane Wonders website). Both builds are quick, heavy hitters that will get the action going. Priestess, while very good, is mainly making a game longer with all her heals, and Wizard, while perhaps being my favorite build, also does that by choking the other's mana.

So get a 'quick' game going and only gradually jump in. Don't expect that 'cause you are an experienced boardgamer' you'll master this game within a first few plays. If you like MtG and/or Summoner Wars: buy it. And give yourself a proper learning experience.

Final note: in this game it is paramount to try whacky stuff and play aggressive. Sure, you might lose. But consider this:

As the goal of playing a game is having fun...
Don't win the game and lose the meta-game of having fun.

[EDIT SEP 2014] Bought a second base-set to accomodate my builds without having the tedious switch-over of the basics (dissolves, dispels, nullifies). It is just that great. Re-rated to a perfect 10.

It's Magic: the Gathering meets miniatures gaming, with a more straightforward, logical ruleset.

The only drawback for me is the randomness of the dice rolls in combat.  I prefer more deterministic play, and I can think of a combat system for this game I would like better - one that reduces the randomness.  Otherwise, this game is amazing, and really, really enjoy it!

Mage Wars is a revelation for all lovers of demanding and complex games, filled with tactical tricks and elaborated maneuvers. Its battle for life and death inside an arena filled with magic. Every player conjures up lots of servants during this fight. They will fight for him, but finally battle reaches wizards themselves. And one of them must fall. Do not let enemy catch you off guard and always be ready. This is your motto, whenever you step inside the arena. You can equip yourself with all kinds of defensive spells, guardians or enchantments, which can ultimately lead to victory. But you need large amout of mana to do this and it comes in limited numbers. And although you have lots and lots of tricks inside your spellbook, you have time to do only up to two spells each round, one of them must be easy to cast and you read incantation for whole turn, so your mage cannot move at all. Both wizards create their spellbooks themselves before the game according to class, they are trained in. No lack of variability is even possible. Game has only a little shortcomings, when it comes to processing - missing blue cubes (you get black instead) and rotated pages for spell cards in second part of the book. But then you reach difficulty and though base mechanics are really easy, straightforward and revolve around activating of characters and only two special quick action phases, there are tens of keywords standing in your way. Some cards are present more than once inside the game, but otherwise each card is a unique creation and does things a little differently. So you have to know your spellbook to be a good mage. But that is not a bad thing, right? There are incredible tactical choices, filled with traps, defenses, flying, ranged attacks, teleportation and others. Its unbeatable problem for inexperienced and children under 12 years. But if you are trained in board games, you will be thrilled. Mage Wars are the boy dream comes true for every player, who likes fantasy theme. And you can now fulfil your dream! All it takes is one journey to a closest retailer shop!

This is a game where you need lots of endurance so you can witness an actual learning curve. I guess you won't have grasped everything even with 50 games in. So with my one session of it I stuck to the advice of people saying that you shouldn't try to aim for the perfect strategy and read through each and every single card but instead go with a "Try and error" or - when you're just lucky enough - "Try and succeed"-approach. The latter was the case, but I would have liked the game either way. The spellbooks are really a nice touch and the artwork has its share in the overall positive impression the game left.

RATING: 5
Ridiculously expandable with an insane amount of replayablilty. The spellbooks is a genius way of tackling the variance problem with card games. My only gripe is that games tend to stale mate and can drag on quite a bit longer than I'd like. All of the tokens and counters can make it quite fiddly as well.

I tried to make it work, but this game is just not good. Way too many keywords and way too long. There is literally an entire codex of keywords. They keywords themselves aren't the worst problem. The issue is that some of the words are understood to encompass other keywords, so you have all of these nested keywords that you either need to memorize or you have to constantly look up while learning the game.

Then there's the length. While learning the game it can easily go 3-4 hours. Once you know it then it will still come in at 2-3 hours. This is just too long for the experience.

Summoner Wars is vastly superior. Sure, there's a ton more stuff going on in Mage Wars, but that certainly doesn't make it better.

Sold.

I finally got a chance to play this very deep, thematic game. I've had it on my interest list for a while now. After playing it, I'm taking it off my wishlist:

1. Ash would hate it.
2. It requires several plays to even start to understand the interactions.
3. It's a bit too long.

It's a wonderful design; don't get me wrong. For the right person, I can see why this would be a dream come true. But it's definitely not for me.

Picked this up after watching a video review.

This is a really great game. Quality of components and art is fantastic. Very high replayability due to the huge number of spells included in base game.  Smooth gameplay.... the rules aren't the greatest but you shouldn't let that hold you back.

Best as a two player experience.... we have tried it multi-player using two boards... still fun.... just not as good as playing it with two.

The included spellbooks are not only a gimmick.... they are an awesome gimmick.

This is far too long for what it is. I feel like it tries to compete against Magic but it's really competing against other meaty 2 player games. I'd never pick this over Twilight Struggle or Go. 

Maybe if this could be condensed into 15 minutes, this would give Magic a run for its money. Maybe.

Unfortunately it doesn't, and thus, another Magic contender falls by the way side.

A love-child between Magic: The Gathering and miniatures games. Without a doubt, the coolest thing about Mage Wars (now Mage Wars: Arena) is the spellbook. Getting to choose the spells you need instead of randomly drawing for them.

My one complaint with the game is the length-
Some games can feel MIND-NUMBINGLY slow and tedious. Hopefully, this may be addressed with Mage Wars: Academy.

I'm really on the fence about this one. Rating may change after subsequent plays. 

"Hey guys, we'll fix Magic: The Gathering by eliminating the luck of the draw! Oh wait, we'll also make all combat reliant on dice rolls, so that an attack that rolls four dice could do anywhere from zero to eight damage! Yup, we sure fixed that randomness factor!"

OK. Magic: The Gathering front-loads randomness in the form of a shuffled deck, while Mage Wars relies on random dice throws to determine combat damage. Who am I to say which is better? 

Well, for one, Magic: The Gathering is chock-full of ways to mitigate its particular form of randomness. A properly built MtG deck will have multiple, redundant ways in which to achieve its strategic goal. It will also have card draw spells, card selection spells, and tutoring spells to ensure that it gets the cards it needs at the right time. If I'm playing a deck that relies on getting big creatures out quickly to directly attack my opponent, I'll run cards like Rampant Growth that allow me to get lands out of my deck and directly into play. If I'm playing a deck that relies on a insta-win combo, I'll run cards like Demonic Tutor that allow me to get the essential combo pieces out of my deck and into my hand. And you can bet that I'll have multiple copies of essential cards to ensure that I draw into them. 

In Mage Wars, if I roll poorly, what can I do? Jack squat, that's what. All those Analysis Paralysis - riddled choices I made selecting spells from my spell book of dozens of cards come down to a crapshoot. 

If my attack doesn't go through in M:tG, it's because my opponent interacted with me, not because I got screwed by dice.

It also takes far too long and requires too much time investment outside of the game for what it is.

One of the best 2 player combat experiences in a board game with loads of fun to be had!  The binders are a genius idea, and the cards are varied and interesting in their powers and abilities!  The game has two problems though: the large board can make some players hide their mage in a faraway corner, making the game last way too long, and the dice based combat sometimes makes some good plans worthless when you just get bad luck.  All in all though, I highly recommend you check it out!

I always like this game better than any CCG/LCG titles, but the addition of multi-player through the Domination expansion put this safely in one of my "best on the shelf" ratings.  I can play with 3 or 4 and be finished in 90 minutes, will usually get a very close game, and have plenty to talk with friends about afterward (like new builds or tactics).  

Love it.

Combination of war hammer, dnd and magic the gathering. I find this more enjoyable than magic and I’ve played that game for the better half of a decade. The fact that all my spells are available to me, not including mana of course, is amazing. The only thing that might drag my opinion down in the future is the length of each game. But I’ve played Star Wars armada clocking in at 2 hours, so I should be fine. Magic too.

I would buy this game in a second if I thought I had someone that would regularly want to play it.  This is exactly the kind of game that is my favorite across all platforms.  Building a custom "deck" of things to conjure and spells to casts based around turn-based tactical movement.  I could play a game like this forever.

Probably shouldn't be rating it after just one play, but I know the rating would just shoot up if I had more opportunity to dive in and play it more.

We really dislike, that the authors several times claim, that this is a really realistic simulation of magic battles. Firstly, players have to decide.

the game has the best mechanic ever created for a strategic card game. It has an excellent game flow, a ton of different mechanics, it is expanded on a very regular basis, the artwork in on the same level as Magic the Gathering (which has at the moment the top level artwork of all card games) and last but not least the guys that invented and support the game are the most helpful persons in the field of board games!!!!!! I needed some more cards to build a few more spellbooks and not only did they send me the cards without obliging me to buy the core game again but they also send me a T-shirt with the logo of the game!!!!!
So, Alfiya my friend and the rest of you guys congratulations for your great efforts and your excellent support!!! If there is a perfect game this is the one!!!!

FOR SALE/TRADE. A brilliant deep game system that, if I was a teenage boy with hours to spare, I'd love. Unfortunately, I'm not and, every time I played it, I wanted to play Summoner Wars instead. Or Yinsh eight times...

It also has a habit of stalemating in the end game. In the last game, I was actually shouting 'die already' at my husband as he ran away and healed his character a few hit points for the nth time. We had run out of decent spells...

So, this is sort of what Magic would be like if you could use your whole deck whenever you wanted to.  Unlike Magic, though, you don't have to worry about rares versus commons, and when you build your deck, you can't rely on that one powerful card to carry the rest of your deck; you have to balance your deck based on points, and based on your particular school of magic.  So far, I like it, but so far, I haven't even delved into the deck-building aspect of the game.  I'm looking forward to playing it more.

I've had this game on my radar for a long time, but kept dismissing it for seeming like another Magic clone.
Well, was I wrong not picking this up earlier! Already the first game I played completely blew me away.
Sure it feels like Magic in theme, but gets rid of everything I didnt like about it.
First and foremost, the luck-of-the-draw gets completely pushed out with the spellbook. Having all spells available to you right from the start is a real breath of fresh air, and creates a sense of true freedom in tactics and strategy, not to mention a ton of immersion. (luck is still a factor though, but this time in the form of dice)
Although the spells induce plenty of different effects and conditions, resulting in a extensive terminology, most things appear very intuitive to anybody who is a little bit acquainted with fantasy and rpgs. (and common sense for that matter)

I've only played the demo version of this, since the actual retail release is still a ways off. The game is basically a riff on Magic the Gathering, the twist being that every spell in your deck is available to you at all times. Combat also has a spatial aspect, as the game takes place over multiple zones in which your mage and summoned creatures are free to roam. Think Summoner Wars, but with far more intricate play. Overall, I'd say the game has a lot of potential. There are aspects of it that I wish were a bit less complicated, but as I mentioned before, the game is still in development. The design team seemed pretty open to feedback at my demo, so there is a very good chance that some of the game's rough edges will get cleaned up before release day. 

Definitely one to keep an eye on.

Best if you know someone who plays a TCG or know someone else who also owns a copy.

Cool.  I really appreciate what the designer tried to do.  It does meld the power of magic with the grit of Summoner Wars.  I'll be investing some time in learning more about the spellbooks and I really like the way the spells are all there in your head as I would suspect a true mage to have knowledge thereof.  Minis would be nice but I can see the downside of having them, so cards will have to suffice for now.

There is a lot going on with this game, very tactical and you have to build your deck looking for the combos. Plays a little long but I think it will go faster with repeated plays

If you like deck construction and do not want to buy tens of thousands of cards this is the game for you, And throw in Card placement and card maneuvering in the mix you got a great game

Can not wait to play this MTG like game with no deck drawing... wife is even looking forward to that also!

Medical reason have not allowed time to play so it is up for trade

-Update Got a chance to finally play it, got to say its a lot easier to just riffle your deck than to bother with the "spellbooks" and on that note its easier to play MTG with access to your whole deck too... dropped in my opinion.

Like: Epic 2 player game. Creating spellbooks. Custom Dice combat. All the cards.

Dislike: A difference in channeling can translate to a clear outcome if the game last long enough. Randomized Combat.

This game has everything I should like.
Yet I find that somehow it doesn't click.
The main gripe being that it's really hard to keep track of all the variables and that I never feel like a mage (not that I have experience) but rather an accountant on a circus arena. But hey I can see the appeal, it somehow rubs me the wrong way.

Wow! Game I've been wanting to play is here!

EDIT: Game is excellent but I can't get it to the table enough to keep the 10 rating for me personally. Honestly, the artwork as well as depth and length of play are part of why for me. Artwork is well done ... very well done. Just ... NSFW.

RATING: 6
Interesting and certainly a lot of depth to the game but seems very derivative of TCGs and its unique combat system using custom dice is overly luck based.

I found mage wars so hard to get into. I usually play fairly heavy euros and have never been in a situation like I was when trying to play mage wars. 

I found it extremely clunky and difficult to understand all the fiddly rules. I feel the game demanded so much time and effort with very little to return to the player.

The quality of the components is very average, especially the binders.

The game is clearly for a niche group of people. If you have read about mage wars and how it plays and think you love that style then check it out. I personally got sucked into buying this by Tom Vassels raving review.

I would recommend EVERYONE to play the game first before purchasing as it may just be one of your biggest mistake purchases, just like how it was mine.

Have started investing more time in this game and really like the system and use of spell book. However, as is usually my problem with these types of games, I do not have time to deck build, but still really enjoy the game.

TRADE INTEREST: LOW

The only reason that I want to trade this is all the other games that I also want to play...

+4 Teleport alternate art promos
+1 Spiked Armor
+1 Bloodwave Greatbow 
+1 Leviathan Scale Armor
+1 Fire Elemental

Truly the best customizable game. Not only does it give me the opportunity to deckbuild a constructed deck, but I can do anything I come up with (excellent design!)!

My only complaint would be the luck of the dice since you could roll poorly/too well at critical moments (yes, I know, that's every dice game), BUT that's also another reason I like it. You are never guaranteed anything, and you are never 100% out of hope! You have to play the odds, take chances, and have back-up plans. Just wish there was a tad less potential for swingy dice rolls.

Sleeved.

Everything I hoped it would be. In-depth self contained card/boardgame; which gives me the depth of MTG w/o needing to buy $100's of dollars worth of cards. Daunting rules, but it all became much clearer after 1 play. Spellbooks are a great idea, and game overall is very exciting.

Biggest con is it is really made for 2-players, and 4-players drags out too long. Other con is trying to get friends to committ to learning a spellbook...not the game's fault but its not as simple as pick up and play. Unfortunately my group isn't interested in committing to learn this. Very rare I will get this on the table =(((

RATING: 7
This game actually intimidates me when playing against someone who is experienced in this game. Having all cards in your spellbook available is really cool and really daunting if I didn't create the spellbook itself. 

I totally digg the spatial element in this game and the various spell books that you can create.

Doesn't feel like a game for the casual players though.

Could have been a 10 but didn't include enough cards to build  several 2 mage combinations of the 4 recommended decks in the base game (e.g. Beastmaster vs. Priestess requires sharing geysers). Everything you need in one box??? Get ready to spend more money.

I love this game, but I wish it was made for multiplayer play. The current format is 100% competitive and I don't like that. Playing this with 3+ players takes waaaaay too long and encourages turtling strategies. I am still waiting for Battlegrounds so we can try it out in a true MP setting. I´m giving this a 8 now as a 2-players game. Muliplayer rating would be a 6.5-7 at max. 

Maybe this game is a bit too complex. Card keywords is really messy to handle when you have players around the table who are not familiar with every single of these keywords.

1st time in collection.


In the meantime we played Mage Wars already a lot more and it is for both of us the game Magic wanted to be. Just to be honest, we ARE Magic players ourselves with quite a big collection but we both like the "intensity" of Mage Wars MUCH more AND definitely we adore the fact that you ALWAYS get the card you want.

Deleted everything I said about this before, and upped its rating to a 9. This game is awesome. The only negative is the fiddly nature of all the keywords and the wording of those keywords on each card...it is easy to mess up a rule with all of that fiddly.

Easily the best dueling wizard game out there.  Like this better than Summoner Wars due to the variety of spells and creatures and the mechanics are so much more streamlined that Serpent's Tongue.  Has a bit of a learning curve, but delivers exactly what it promises.  Need to have more time and a dedicated opponent to get the most out of this.

RATING: 9
This is a brilliant game. Love the theme and the strategic aspect of the game play. The art for most of the cards is very good. Still learning, and playing with the default spell books but have a lot of fun. I think is the best 2 player game on the market right now for me.

RATING: 3
+Tons of cool options
+Solid theme and cool art
+Very affordable for a miniatures style game
+Makes you feel like an awesome grand mage
-Slow ramp up (First few turns always seem to be just building up your side of the board)
-Far too much luck and variance in the dice rolls
-Takes forever to end the game
-Too AP prone
-Setting up the spellbook can take a long time and be tedious (Having to count up all the cards based on their level and type)
-Heavy learning curve because of the massive amount of mechanics (Cards have no explanations and no reference sheets. Where did I leave that rulebook again?)
-Box is ridiculously huge (New version is better)

I can see why some people would like Mage Wars, but it is not for me. Will be getting rid of this one at some point.

this game is an absolute thrill. the apprentice game was full of action, and the dueling feels natural and real. 

I just finished building my own spellbook here, and it was a great experience just putting together the deck you'll be using. improves upon MTG (which I've never played but have seen and heard enough about to know) by having a board, and the ability to use any of your spells at any time! That's a huge plus.

update: MTG took away the chance to get this to the table.

RATING: 8
Very well done Magic dueling game. It really feels like two mages battling an epic duel. The sides are very diverse. Very interesting mechanics are that you can select every spell in a book from the start of the game. 
It's tactical : you move your creatures and mage in an arena where positioning is important. Strategical : you'll need a long term plan with your mage to win. 

Minor nitpicks: 

* you need to deckbuild because the starting spellbooks are unbalanced
* you'll need a few games before you will be comfortable with the rules
* first game will be daunting and overwhelming : a lot of cards to read  
* requires both players to be equally skilled

This is what I wish Magic the Gathering was. It is an epic customizable card game providing you with the most thematic feeling of dueling mages ever devised. It does take a lot longer to play (90 minutes) and is less portable, so it doesn't fit the same niche as Magic does as a portable filler, but man the experience is amazing.

The game is almost pure strategy since you don't have to worry about random card draws. Yes, there are dice, but they have a very predictable bell curve and they provide randomness of outcome rather than randomness of choice. You can make plans around the dice, and you can make contingency plans in case things don't go as you wished. That's not something you can do with random card draws where your decisions are limited by what's in your hand. Having your entire spell book available at all times makes this game incredibly strategic, and having the board gives you tactical positioning as well.

I just can't stress enough how much fun this game is and how much it rewards good strategic planning. It truly is a battle of wits with fireballs. The only downside I can think of is the learning curve. It's not really any worse than other CCG's or Miniature games though, so if you're comfortable with those you should be fine. Still, there are a lot of rules and card interactions to digest and it will take even an experienced gamer many plays before they get everything right.

被不少人誉为版图实体化后的万智牌，当对规则及卡牌效果都熟悉后，游戏犹如突然从抽象概念转变成具体活物，规则框架极为严谨也相对繁琐。此外目前基础版仅是这个法师世界的冰山一角，从此雏形上就可以看到其无穷的扩张力和源源不断的生命力。虽然此类游戏的运气因素大些，但天命人不可违，你需要作出的即你对现场情况的最佳判断。。。

A really very good customisable game in the vein of Magic. Removes the random drawing from a deck and gives you access to your whole deck - spellbook - from the get go. Adds a board and some random dice for combat.

All in all very good, but drops a bit for game length and a steep learning curve. But persevere, it's worth it.

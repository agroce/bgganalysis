This is my favorite civ game I've played so far. It does not have the bling as other civ games have better components, but they also have wonky battle mechanics or take an entire day to play it. This game leaves in most of the good parts and leaves out most of the bad stuff, as far as my tastes go. Win win.

One of my favourite worker-placement games so far. Interesting mechanics which blend well enough flavourfully. There was a sense of grandeur managing my nation, and every nation felt unique thanks to their different special powers. 
It's replayable; flows surprisingly well.

I highly enjoy the multiplayer variant, and moderately enjoy playing Nations solo. The game is complex enough -- and luck-less enough -- to reward skill and thought. There are many ways to win, and tactics can change quickly over the course of a game. Both long-term thinking and flexible, tactical reactions are rewarded. Plus, whether you're winning or losing at any given time, it's important to stay on your toes, because it's not game over until it's officially over. Comebacks are possible. Additionally, the nuanced A/B sides of the player nations and the varying cards based on skill added a second degree of depth worthy of applause. I found solo play to be a bit easy, and playing for the sake of points isn't as fun as playing for survival/dominance. The "shadow opponent" doesn't think, so it's probably a bit too easy to outmaneuver. However, it's still fun overall.

Very clever civilisation game, with familiar mechanics but lots of nice new twists. Well-paced and perfectly balanced. It's all very intuitive, and the components are nice (even if some of the artwork is a little amateurish). It feels like a meatier St Petersburg, and that's not a bad thing at all! Great strategy game.

LIKE: The player's tableau is where the meat of strategy is, allocating properly and keeping spots flexible. Many paths to win. Interesting ways to adjust the game for playing abilities and length. War and bad events give you enough time to react. Competing for the cards added good tension. plays smooth.

DISLIKE: long game (4p=3.5 to 4 hr). The randomness of cards can be streaky and deny a card you need. Can be a punishing game, frustrating players.

OVERALL: A nation management game, reacting to events. Subtle strategies, but a lot of thinking and hard decisions. Perfect amount of player interaction. The randomness of cards is not terrible, but it can mess up your goals. i wish the game was shorter, but this could be adjusted. The game gets better the more it is played.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
It's obvious why this is a darling: a zillion cards of which you'll typically see only a fraction in any given play. The simplicity of the actions belies the complexity of interactions between players. There is the limited pool of cards for purchase, but also the conflict in military values, stability and 'books' is very good between players. It does take some time to complete, but there is an anxious fun in seeing the next set of available progress cards. And oh the tension in keeping your civilization viable by balancing all resources needed! Everything runs lean - delightful!

EDIT: After several more plays, I'm having trouble finding any fault with this game. I love it! I'm also finding the 'B' side of civs to be curiously *easier* to play than the 'A' side.

EDIT: More plays in. The game is wearing a bit now. I still find it really good, but I've explored most of what it has to offer. Scoring high is a matter of tactics - taking advantage of opportunities presented - and little more than that. It remains tense to be sure!

RATING: 9.8
Una pasada de juego, para los amantes de la microgestión, recursos, y apurar puntos de victoria buscando las mejores vías posibles, y siempre con tensión de ir teniendo los recursos justos. Único punto negativo: la caja GIGANTE, sobra aire de forma exagerada!
Me gusta bastante más que el TTA, empezando por la duración, consigue unas sensaciones muy parecidas, y no tienes la sensación de que alguna carta como líder o maravilla, ha descompensado totalmente el juego por estar muy OP y no hablemos de lo exagerado del TTA del militar y que te salga o no cierta carta de guerra que también puede estar muy descompensada (que como ventaja tiene que eso le da al juego un toque de interacción más directa). Y te permite más libertad y decisión que las mejoras fijas de cartas del TTA por no hablar de el AHORRO BRUTAL de tiempo con la burocracia constante del ajuste de cubitos. En mesa, muchísimo mejor Nations.
TTA siendo un gran juego (a pesar de las cartas OP), es la excepción de que es mucho mejor online, quizá la nueva versión mejore un poco el equilibrio, pero el resto será mismo juego.

Fantastic civ-building game.  It's got a very Euro-y feel, but captures the theme pretty well.  It's a relatively straight-forward game with a fair helping of luck, but seems deep enough and strategic enough to be worth the long play time.  Having only played twice and not having used any of the "advanced" cards, I do feel like most of the cards are just slight variations on each other, but my hope is that the advanced cards will spice things up.  Plus, giving each card widely differing powers might send AP through the roof.  In my plays so far, AP has not been much of a problem and turns tend to go pretty quickly for the most part.

This is a game I feel has a lot of promise and I look forward to playing it more.

RATING: 6
This is meant to be a "Through the Ages" Lite but it fails to deliver. It seems to have a large amount of randomness which prevents any form of long term strategy being formed so it's just a case of minmaxing turns. It also isn't that much shorter than TtA so it doesn't have a lot going for it over TtA.

+ The different nations you can start as feel different enough to really add to the replayability; Cool cards to buy and use really have you weighing tough options on each and every turn.
- Military can feel a bit binary, but I like that choosing no military is a viable option.


Why it's previously-owned:
The drafting/buying cards from the tableau just didn't feel right to me.  Just the fact that Abraham Lincoln can be purchased by the Chinese is one odd moment that pushed this into the I-like-it-but-I'll-probably-always-choose-another-game category.
This got traded for a bunch of Star Wars LCG stuff.

Very good civilization game! It is much more streamlined than other civ games. The relative status for war and stability is a very interesting mechanic.  The worker-placement is also quite unique.
However, the artwork is not good. And the game is very long and may drag on due to missing highlights.

Through The Ages redux.  The similarities are too plentiful to be ignored.  In fact, the overall gameplay and experience feels very much the same.  Granted, there are many differences (especially military, wars & TtA's culture track), but I would rather play TtA.

Nations is a solid civ game.  The cards drive the game.  Limited manpower.  A nice twist with different starts via the B-sides of the player mats.  And you don't see all of the cards in any age, not even close, meaning different games can and will have wildly different skews in card distribution.  Also, the events push-pull on EVERYTHING, which can be good, bad or ridiculously painful.  VP gain is *VERY* incremental.

I want to say Nations is a nice, faster, lighter take on Through The Ages.  Yes, I *want* to say that but I can't.  Because it isn't.  It doesn't play much faster.  It's not that much lighter.  And the warfare in Nations is actually *MORE* brutal than with TtA.

I'll play Nations at times, I suppose, but I'll probably be wondering why I'm not playing Through The Ages instead.

Excellent game.  First game with 5 players lasted 3.5 hours.  The players were not hardcore gamers.  Everyone had a good time even though it was a long game. Player ages were 45, 35, 17, 16, 14.  1 male, 4 female.

Pros:
Easiest rulebook to read and find information ever.
Logical layout of bits.
Does not feel fiddly.
Single player was also enjoyable for me.  It is a "can you top your score" type of single player game.
Very quick set up of game and very quick take down.
Leaves you with the "I want to play again" feeling after playing it.
Tactical players will enjoy.

Cons:
Game bits could be better quality, but are not as bad as some people say.
You may not be able to "play it again" after playing it because of the length of time to play.
Strategic players will not enjoy.

I have not played through the ages, but I have played 7 wonders.  This game feels like 7 Wonders in spirit.  This is the first worker placement game I've played/gotten.

update:  playing this 2 player is pretty enjoyable.  I play this with one of my nieces often.  She likes it. It takes about 1 hr as a 2 player game, pretty consistently.

RATING: 5
1st play: I liked the game ok.  I really have to play it again to form a full opinion, but the challenge for this game is that it is compared against TTA, and it comes up short.  It's nice to play a 2 hour version of TTA, with a bit less depth and better art.  The big problem though, is that there's not a lot of compelling choices.  One building feels very much the same as each other building.  Some of the cards don't feel very thematically appropriate.

2nd play: The game was better this time. We played without the advanced cards, and we shuffled better.  Unfortunately the game is blah.  It really just feels like a very abstracted worker placement game.  None of the things you do in the game feel important nor thematic.

An excellent worker placement game. Lots of thematic flavor. 

The multitude of cards meant that, no 2 games will play the same. Though it may seem that there are lots of options in each and every turn, but it's not. It's up to the player to decide how he/she would like to bring his nation towards which victory pathway. From that decision, to formulate your play/plan towards that goal.

Significant player interaction in War especially, so players  can't concentrate on their own options only and forgo some sacrifices..

Overall, a cut above Lords Waterdeep and such similar worker placement type game. Highly replayable.

Nations is a neat civ themed game. Although, mechanically, I don't think the gameplay really drives home the civ theme. The central board tracks stability, military strength, wars, and various random events. So that's all very civilization-y. But Nations is primarily a tableau building euro game with emphasis on worker allocation and gathering/managing resources. The main and plain of the gameplay is purchasing cards that come out onto the public market which gets filled up twice per age.

Unfortunately, the pacing of the game can be very strange since the things that come out on the market are randomly drawn and you might not see very many cards for the things that you *should* be seeing a lot of, statistically, and vice versa. The events are also pretty random and can be brutal. On the other hand, this randomness enhances replayability and the narrative of each game session. 

I also wish that there were more starting civs as well. The included nations are cool, but extremely limited (there are so few). Regardless, it's a very good game.

I'm not a huge fan of it, because it feels very abstract and arbitrarily limiting.  The resources don't make a ton of sense, and the fact that you have to overwrite slots just adds choices to make parts of your board completely incremental and pointless.  Too much fluff and vaguely representative gameplay, not enough solid mechanics and integrated theme.

Great civilization game with easy to learn rules and fast gameplay. The nice rulebook makes this game accessible to everyone. The comparisons to Through the Ages are inevitable. Nations is faster and lighter without loosing much of his bigger 'brother'.

RATING: 9.25
I will start by saying that Nations is not a civ building game but a euro-game. Despite the wars, the game is a fairly complex worker placement rewarding the player with the most flexible strategy, the one who can make the best use of the cards appearing each round. The military could be very well be called "resource" and it would not change the game at all, but this just proves that it's euro. It had the potential to be a 9.5 or even a 10, but it has two drawbacks - the wars which are simply punishing without affecting the strongest player (no catching up mechanism there) and some of the cards are way too powerful. 

Nations remains one of the best games from Essen 2013 and it's high ratings and buzz are well deserved.

EDIT: Rating changed to 9.25 after 4 more games. Why? The game is faster than written on the box when you play with experienced players, I am rating it as a euro rather than a civ, the high replay value, no major imbalance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
+ Shorter playtime compared to TtA (Nations is easier to get to the table).
+ Better with more players, while TtA is playable due to down time only with 3 players.
+ War system worked actually pretty well (even though before the first game I was a bit worried)
- Somehow the building of your civilisation did not feel as palpable as in TtA. I guess it has something to do with the ups and downs each civilisation must face are much stronger in TtA.
- Mixing the stability feature to the wars was confusing and it seemed overpowered
- In the end you get points from everything, so the scores are close and it's hard to tell why someone actually won.

The advantage of the first player is extremaly unballanced much more than in e.g. Caylus. Drawed Egyptians and was the last player in order of the first round. The first player built some soldiers than took colonies cheaply boosting his production than played a war so at the end of the first round we could say that the play is finished. Really frustrating :/
Newer saw the player who was as last in turn order as a winner until we modified the rules. Now we play this way that the second player takes a bonus 1 coin at the beginning, the third takes 2 coins etc. It neutralizes the cost of taking the card from the board and gives you some chcnces.

Played it wrong the first time, but overall the gameplay was surprisingly pleasant.

Reasons why it is better than Through the Ages

#1 Player actions are spread out and it isn't one massive turn (speeds up the gameplay and significantly reduces downtime)

#2 Simplification - Not having to pay for buildings, much simpler war/raid rules, moving gold into civil actions (allows much more flexible turns since you can save these up from previous rounds), removing military actions.  

#3 Newbie friendly - The "Growth" step allows people to recover from mistakes by getting the gold/food/ore that they might not have planned for previously.

Reasons why I still might play Through the Ages

#1 Less player interaction.  You can't directly attack players (this could in some ways also be seen as a plus)

#2 You will get to see all of the cards.  We had a significant issue where two players were effectively stuck in the stone age as it came to rock production because there were only two ore producing cards that came up, both which were taken by a single player.  In TtA, you can at least anticipate and know the # of items that will come up for each player

#3 Newbification - There is still something to be said about playing an epic game of TtA with hardcore boardgamers and being absolutely cutthroat.

RATING: 7
Gran juego de civilizaciones, con mecánicas de eurogame, eso si.
Tengo que probarlo más antes de dar un veredicto definitivo, pero por el momento me ha gustado.

Se parece al TTA en las cosas buenas y es mucho más ágil porque no tienes que esperar a que los otros jugadores acaben su turno antes de hacer tú el tuyo. Se van alternando las acciones y eso lo hace mucho más dinámico.

Escala bien, te mantiene siempre interesado en la partida y rezuma civilizaciones aunque no es un temático ni mucho menos.

La variedad de cartas, y que no se jueguen siempre todas, hace que las partidas sean siempre diferentes. También ayuda a esto los eventos que van apareciendo que tb. son diferentes siempre y de dureza muy variable.

Lo peor de todo es la caja, que es enorme para lo que contiene. Demasiado aire.

Veremos como va evolucionando, pq superar a TTA no es cosa fácil. Puede que este Nations, al ser tan pulido y tan redondo canse un poco a la larga, mientras que TTA con sus impurezas siempre es un valor seguro. Es una impresión que me ha dado. El TTA no es perfecto, pero tiene algo que hace que sea muy difícil de quemar. No sé si en este caso ocurrirá lo mismo.

Kinda-lighter-but-not-really-light spin on Through the Ages which diminishes the devastation in military.  In my opinion, it does this at the expense of the game's soul.

If Nations were available online, I wouldn't be particularly interested.  So it goes.

Initial rating after playing twice. Very well put together game, with excruciating decisions. Early turns in a new round take forever due to far too many choices. Turns after that speed up a lot, so the game doesn't feel like too much of a slog, but it sure takes a looong time; more than I'm generally fond of.
Cards in the basic game feel very similar, with just numbers swapped about - I hope the advanced cards will mix it up a bit.

Juegazo. Me apetece siempre y creo que es el juego al que más he jugado si no de los que más lo he hecho.

Es un placer evolucionar la civilización.
Cinco variables muy intrincadas entre sí son los engranajes del juego: El dinero (nos permite comprar las cartas y garantizo problemas si no lo tienes), la piedra (nos permite emplazar trabajadores e incluso construir maravillas; aquí es dónde se reparten los puntos, de hecho, al último turno hemos de llegar con piedra como para cambiar las pirámides de sitio), La comida (necesaria para abastecer a la civiliación), y los libros, con una doble función: comodín a falta de abastecer cualquier necesidad y porque se transforman en cinco ocasiones en puntos de victoria, cuatro durante la misma, y una última al contabilizarlos de nuevo y dividirlos entre diez para dar ese número de puntos de nuevo.

Las sensaciones del juego son maravillosas: es evolucionar, es adaptar es crecer en lo militar, es putear con guerra, adelantarte a las necesiadades de los contrincantes, consolidadar la estabilidad, rezar para que las nuevas cartas favorezcan a tus necesidades, cruzar los dedos para que el nuevo evento no te destroce, correr contra los demás por no ser el último en la guerra, o ser el primero en estabilidad o....
y de mientras construir todas aquellas maravillas que ningún juego te ha permitido hacer, luchar con los ejércitos más poderosos y olvidados ludicamente, ser liderados por personajes no mediaticos, librar batallas decisivas que ningún juego reconoce y superar eventos desde la peste negra a las invasiones ándalas,  sucesos que marcaron el devenir y que han sido olvidados  mientras tus obreros desestabilizan la civilización, pidiendo también más comida pero generando más recursos. Ya digo: una experiencia gloriosa

Pero con un defecto: es decir, el juego es un diez. para lo que yo le pido es perfecto.... pero casi. Y el casi viene por el fuerte componente de azar. Casi no existe, es imperceptible: pero está a radales, detrás de cada volteo de cartas: Querer ir a militar y se inviable por no poder adquirir la única carta que da poderío militar; o necesitar piedra y ver solo un edificio de la era uno. ni colonias ni edades doradas.... Todo mitigable con batallas y edades de oro pero que a partidas de cuatro jugadores son tan excasas que apenas te permiten arrastrarte por el tablero pididndo una pedra. Un apuñetera piedra...

Más cosas: aquel mito de que las guerras no eran decisivas, que el poderío militar estaba mitigado por la solidez de la estabilidad era tan solo eso: un mito.

En el juego se brilla de distintas maneras pero si quieres ganar, has de ir a poderío militar y por supuesto a libros (cultura). Provocar una guerra y hacer comerse el punto de pérdida más algún recurso no hace gracia. Responder al poderío gastando recursos en colocar trabajodres que respndan a la fuerza de la guerra es un desgaste que no siempre es asumible. 

El juego está tan bien testeado que al final de la partida la victoria se decide por dos tres puntos... y es ahí donde miras tus huecos de colonias, tus maravillas incacabadas o los quecos que ocupan puestos en edicifios industriales.  Si lo sabré yo!

Can't help it is has to be a 10.

Best strategy advice: "It all depends." :)
There does not seem to be a dominating strategy as all depends on other player's decisions and new cards that come up on the market.
Lots of player interaction with ever changing early, mid and endgame leaders.

RATING: 7
Had I not played Through the Ages, then I would have found much to admire about this game.  As it is it simplifies some aspects of TTA, handles the war very nicely, introducing a target set by the player declaring war, which can be mitigated if you declare war yourself by setting it at your own strength level.  Our first game suffered from very few early blue cards appearing, restricting possibilities of employing more meeples.  I guess our expectations were set by TTA, whereas there are some minor variations from TTA in Nations (including the fact that only of a selection of the cards will be used, adding to the replayability but also some 'lumpyness').

There lies my concern with this game.  I cannot recall playing a published game which so closely resembles another published game.  Nations is good but it is not TTA, which was a ground breaker and I think superior.  Plagurism is a work that springs to mind.  I could see no reference to TTA as a source/inspiration in the rule book which I think is out of order.  I do however note that TTA's designer Vlaada Chvátil is mentioned in the credits.  So I assume there must have been some tacit approval of its publication from VC, or maybe this just reflects some tension between CGE and CBG?

As a foot note I should add that whilst four of the five players got some satisfaction from the game, the fifth gave up in frustration, tipped his board over and left.  First time that has happened to me in many year's of gaming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
The rules are vague in some issues. Have some errors, typos, even on the player board there's a typo, come on, this is not acceptable nowadays.

Lots of things not explained in the rule book (mostly how the cards work in certain situations) fortunately the designers have na excelent FAQ and errata posted here. Also there's some good players aid and guides. So, that should not be a detriment to buying the game, though the price might, for what you get this is a bit overpriced. The player boards are thin and they're not even cardboard. 

Feels like it was meant to be a 2 to 4 player game, but they stretched it to 5 players. Things like "the most" becomes "the 2 most" and the same for least.

The art work is nothing special but is functional.

The game play is very good, very simple, you basically buy cards, from a central space. Those cards can be building, army, wonders, leaders... and then allocate workers to certain buildings and armies to build your resources and knowledge.

The solitaire variant works and is very simple to use. It's a good way to fine-tune your game skills.

Ez volt a 700-dik játék, amit próbáltam:) Örülök, hogy egy ilyen szintű játékkal jubiláltam. (javítás: elnéztem, csak a 695-dik, nem a 700-dik...) Szinte mindenki a TTA-hoz hasonlítja, nem véletlenül, rengeteg elem visszaköszön onnan, pl. csodaépítés szintjei, kártyatípusok, kártyakezelés (bár az Szentpétervárra is hajaz), erőforrás kezelés (folyamatos aktualizálgatás a pontozótáblán), népesség kajaszükséglete... de valahogy itt minden jóval egyszerűbb, úgy összességében kevésbé mély a játék. Vannak új ötletek is, és a sok hasonlóság ellenére se azt éreztem, hogy egy TTA klónnal játszom (Kevésbé hasonlók, mint mondjuk a Caylus meg a Waterdeep).
Van pár új és jó dolog benne (pl a csodáknál az építész), de szerintem a fő erénye a változatosság: már az alap pakliban is rengeteg a kártya, némelyik egész ötletes, a Nemzet táblák B oldala is új színt vihet a játékba, ezen kívül ott a rengeteg eseménykártya is. Szép, jól működik, de (és itt jön a nagy hibája) nekünk annyira hosszú volt, hogy ez megkérdőjelezi nálam, miért játsszam ezt a TTA helyett. Ráadásul a játék 1/3-ánál tutira látszott, ki fog nyerni, azért egy 5 órás partinál ez kicsit gáz. Ennek ellenére is azt mondom, nagyon jó játék, csak hát civilizációs játékokban a TTA magasra tette a mércét.
Ja még egy dolog, ami fura volt, és többünknek is zavaró: hogy a 4 erőforrás közül 3-at tokenekben tartunk nyilván, egyet viszont a pontozótáblán. A VP-t viszont megintcsak tokenekben, ugyanolyan címletekben, mint a 3 tokenes erőforrást... Nyilván ez nem véletlen, a könyvekre sok kártya hivatkozik, jó hogy nem kell mindig számolgatni, de akkor is fura kicsit:)

Way more luck than TtA, but has good ideas. I think you'd need to play with a variant where at least 2 of each card type (maybe only 1 war or yellow) showed up each turn, to prevent someone from getting hosed.

Preliminary rating after one play. It seems like a more euroish version of TtA and even though generally I don't like eurogames I think I actually like this one more than TtA, mostly because it avoids some of the problems that I find in TtA: long downtimes and too much emphasis on military. The fact that not all the cards come into play each time may not be a bad thing too, coz TtA oftentimes feels too scripted with the same cards coming each game.

RATING: 5
After one play only, but I don't see myself playing this game in the nearby future. Foremost because it's too long. It took us 2,5 hours (3 players only) to reach end of renaissance (we played everything basic as the rulebook suggested), then we decided not to continue. Not because we didn't enjoy the game, but we just had to depart. Anyway, I don't think it's a bad game, but definitely not for me now - too long, too much bookkeeping (I truly didn't like that aspect of calculating everything end the end of each round, didn't seem elegant to me) and - as a result - not as much fun as I expected.

Through the ages lite. Not bad at all. I like the fact they stayed a mainstream course. The main strategy is "balance management", just like in through the ages. Apart from that, there are minor similarities in the mechanics. I expected more from the graphic design though. Especially the backgrounds seem a bit simplistic. Some tracks would be nice too.
After some plays:
the game has depth!
for a clear 10 I would like something more innovative with the card offer.

RATING: 9
A game that almost plays like a sandbox. Unlike Through the Ages, the strategy can differ immensely from one game to the next since not all cards come out.  Both have their strengths, but I like the sandbox a bit more.  (Note: I have only played Through the Ages: a New Civilization twice, and enjoyed it, but really need subsequent plays to REALLY judge the difference.)

I enjoy nations but this is a difficult game.  Resources are always notoriously hard to come by and it will hurt your brain.  The manual isn't kidding when it says "at times you'll feel like the game is playing you" I get that feeling often. I rarely score over 40 points but I guess that could be my fault, and either way it makes for great replay value. One day I'll break 50.

I really like the historical references on the cards, it's a good theme if you are into that kind of stuff, if not it's whatever.  The artwork leaves a little to be desired.

The mechanics are great and solo play is pretty good.  The components are pretty bad (especially for the high price), warped boards, card stock quality player boards, and the worst box/insert ever.

In short it's a good game, not amazing, but I'm glad I bought it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nations is like the young boxeur entering the ring to contest the title to the champion, and the champion is Through the Ages.
It loses because it's inevitable, but Nations is able to score some points.

1) Nations is definitely shorter, easier to teach and less fiddly than TTA.

2) Wars are handled in a very elegant way. They lack the tension of wars in TTA, but are less punitive to the losers, and military light civilizations won't be abused in every way by stronger opponents.

There are many other points in which Nations is weaker than TTA, though:

1) Less micro-management means more focus in card drafting. It means a lighter game, but also less satisfaction: there is less room to specialize (things have to be fully paid anyway, there is no discounts for upgrading) and strategize (especially considering that the cards would not all come out each game).

2) Scoring is more linear and euro-ish in Nations, while TTA can have wild scoring swings towards the end. TTA has also more card combos. The scoring in TTA grows exponentially, and that means epic comebacks and a stronger story arc.

Overall, Nations is a very good game, and it only suffers from the comparison to a masterpiece. Its lighter fare (it's far to the mind-taxing experience of a game of TTA), easily teachable nature make it a very different beast than TTA, and they both deserve a place in a collection.

I am definitely looking to play it again.

Initial Impression: This card game/tableau builder manages to streamline a civ game into a satisfying 2 hour experience. The lack of direct interaction is doesn't mar the enjoyment in the least. There are many paths to victory yet the game doesn't feel like a point salad. The limited number of cards revealed in each game suggests a large amount of replayability as well as room for expansion decks. I will enjoy playing more of this game.

It's a game that keeps you coming back for more. The cards and player powers are varied enough to make every game feel somewhat different--though you're trying to solve a similar tactical puzzle. Nations plays reasonably well at a number of player counts and isn't too hard for new players to pick up and play. The mechanisms of the game allow for the players to perform their moves quickly without adding much downtime for the other players, but certain players could slow the game down to a crawl as they agonize their next move. 

Nations feels more akin to a conventional, tactics-heavy, Euro-style game than a strategy-heavy civilization game. The wars in the multiplayer game appear to be Nations' key contribution to feeling at all like a civilization game outside of thematic art and card design. The solo game feels more akin to a pure euro than a true civ game. 

As for my least favorite aspect of the game: the last round feels somewhat flat. Instead of feeling like you're finally pushing your civilization to its completion, you instead focus on shuffling around your resources to maximize points. It's the least fulfilling moment in the game. The earlier rounds are engaging and fun, however.

In the end, it's a very good, engaging game with some flaws. The anti-climatic final round moves this rating from a strong 8 to a 7.5.

I've only played once, but I like this better than TTA.  The player interaction in Nations is more my style.  I especially like that in Nations players have access to the same card draft.  In TTA, cards enter and leave the drafting area without some players getting an opportunity to purchase.  Military is also handled better in Nations for weaker players can jump on the war cards. In TTA, military cards are a total crapshoot for you may draw poorly, such as someone drawing all tactics' cards, whereas your opponents may draw an even mix of colonies, events, wars, aggressions, defense, etc.

Tried Through the Ages, Civilization, Historia and Nations, still need to try Clash of Cultures.  Nations is the best so far, but not without its flaws.  The excellent solo mode in Nations is a clear advantage, and will surely lock Nations place in my collection for a long time.  Unfortunately, Nations multiplayer is not nearly as friendly a game as it was promoted to be.  As with so many other games in this genre, it is easily possible to get stuck in a downward spiral of death where you are defeated early in the game with no hope of recovery and hours of play still to go.  Aggressive play is also heavily incentivized.  The Dynasties expansion mitigates this somewhat, but not enough to make multiplayer an appealing option again.  It is almost certain that one or more players will not have an enjoyable experience.  Solo mode gets a rating of 10, multiplayer maybe a 6, so 8 overall.

Rewards good planning but really unforgiving (Wars and some events)
Almost on par with my favorite civ game Through the Ages. Many people would think it is TOO similar to TtA but I get a totally different experience than playing TtA.  The game systems are different in many ways including how military works, Corruption in TtA, Money (Nations) vs Civ Actions + Science Points (TtA), end game scoring (N) vs VP generation (TtA) etc.
Overall I think it is reasonable to own both games and still able to enjoy both in different ways.

First Play: I held off buying this at Essen because of the frankly amateur artwork. In places it reminds me of the drawings that came with early D'n'D modules, especially the figures. I know it should be about the game but somehow this offended me.

However when offered a chance to play I was happy to accept. It is in essence a simplified version of Through the Ages which I think is a sublime game of balance and skill. However I must say I am suprised at the extreme praise Nations has received this far because it is no where near as good. My main gripe has to be the degree of randomness that exists. In TtA the card strip gives you an indication of whats coming, in Nations a small proportion of the cards are used for each phase so you don't know whats coming or the distribution. In our game only one Military card came out for the first 3 turns and the owner dominated the warfare aspects of the game and turn order. 

It seems that trying to pursue a strategy is a lottery. Just because you need a building that produces more stone doesn't mean one will turn up, meanwhile the turn order can be crucial for one array of cards, irrelevant for another where the cards are middle of the road. There is no way to predict whats coming, you just need crossed fingers and a rabbits foot.

There are so many situations where the luck of the cards can fall in your lap or slap you in the face. The event card is turned AFTER you select whether to take a man or resources so you cant try to manage a situation out, you just have to guess. On one turn for me I took a new man needing food when the event card then gave bonuses to the player with most food, and the cards turned didn't justify an extra man. So often success just comes down to blind luck.

I am confused and somewhat disappointed that so many in the community rate this so highly. If you enjoy the buzz of a luck based game then you will probably like this. Just don't ask me to play with you.

Nations scratches the itch I sometimes have to play a civ game without the huge set up, rules minutiae or time commitment. It basically is Through the Ages lite. I have taught this to various people and it has gone over well. Take a card or place a worker. Upkeep can be brutal with food and/or stability if you aren't careful though. I would recommend always using the advanced side of the civilizations, even with new players. Having your own special thing that no-one else has makes the players more invested in the game, IMO.

Something is missing in the overall game feeling. Perhaps the very low interaction and predictability made me not feel at home for this one. very boring progress cards and boring mechanic. ridiculous resource accumulation mechanic. A solid design for the average Eurogamer who Thinks theme is over-rated (what is it good for?) and feel comfortable to be able to analyse most turns in advance. I will play it when it is put on the table but mostly for Company and for the theme which exists somewhat. But I would have expected more from a Civ game. in general, what is wrong with having a Map and area Control???

Nations is a great civilization game! It's a longer game, but very engaging and tons of fun. The events are random and can heavily favor certain strategies while putting others at a disadvantage.

Very enjoyable civ building game. A bit less involved than TtA but the streamlining makes for a much quicker game. I prefer this with three players as it can still run long in our game group with more. Great depth of play and always very competitive. There is enough variation with all the cards. The flipside of this is that sometimes you can get a very strange mix of cards. Still, everybody has to deal with that. So not a real issue for me. Graphic design could have been better. At least it's functional.

1. Intro: I confirm that this game is Through the Ages Elegant. This is the best Civilization game I have played and is far better than Through the Ages (43 plays of TTA). This game will rise to TOP 10 and overtake Through the Ages. I also predict that it will also overtake Twilight Struggle and become the number 1 game on BGG because it is that good
2. Weight: Heavy
3. Audience: This game would be a gate way game from medium into heavy euro game. 
4. Players: For 1 to 5 players. Plays best with 5 players imho.
5. Solitaire: Yes
6. Bits: The pieces are good quality. The cards are good stock. 
7. Rules: The rules are concise, clear and well written. If you are a moderator for the game its easy to explain in about 20 minutes.
8. Setup: 10-15 minutes
9. Game-flow: There are eight turns in the game. There is practically no down time. The flow is fast because there are only 3 player actions, The choices in those actions can cause you to pause but there is plenty of time to figure out what to do while others are playing their turns.
10. Randomness: Open card drafting based on turn order.
11. Interaction: The player interaction is well balanced. Choices will deny others cards and there is some confrontation with wars. The wars however can be avoided or the effects can be minimized. 
12. Downtime: Next to know down time.
13. Fun: This game leaves you wanting to play again right away because there are so many different paths to victory. Lots of tension right to the end. Victory point distribution will be close which adds to the end game climax of who is going to win.
14. Theme: There is a story to the game which is your empire and how you built it. I felt ownership of my empire and I definitely had to struggle to manage six different resources
15. Recommendation: I recommend this game for those that love civ games, heavy euros or for those players that want to advance from medium weight games to an elegant engaging short civ game. This game is much better than through the ages because it is less cumbersome that TTA and plays in half the time. If I had to chose between Nations and Through the Ages I would play Nations because it is faster and just as engaging.

PS: I have played Nations 6 times (on the A side and with the Advance cards added) with some very tough opponents and the game shines even more. In addition the game was played an additional 4 times by other members in are group. I bought the game the week before Christmas so this game is very hot. In fact it is hotter than any games I have seen our games group play since I have been a member (2008).  My group has been together since 1975. 

PREDICTION: This is the best Civilization game I have played and is far better than Through the Ages (43 plays of TTA). This game will rise to TOP 10 and overtake Through the Ages. I also predict that it will also overtake Twilight Struggle and become the number 1 game on BGG because it is that good

On its own Nations is decent.
The problem is, that is heavily borrows idears from Throught the Ages and TTA is just much much better.
Many of the mechanisms in Nations are obviously meant to mitigate subjective problems with TTA (long play time, destructive capabilities of wars, exponential point increase).
These are the problems, that make it so hard to get into TTA. The designers of Nations tried to mitigate these. Unfortunately I don't want to play an engine buidling game with only linear resources and points increase. I want a game were the constant risk of war is a real threat and not a minor inconvenience. The shorter playtime is an improvement, but practically worthless, since Nations (similar to TTA) is too long to play it on a weekday and if I play a game like this on a holiday, or weekend, I prefer TTA.

Nations is so boring and dry that even its supposed «light civilization game» part is merely pasted on a simpler set of rules: in the end you never feel like you’re building a civilization; instead, all you can do over and over until you’re bored to death is bookeeping your resources production and usage.

From the first to the last turn you only keep buying cards (whose generic and uninspired drawings make them indistinguishable from a bunch of similar cards) and grind victory points: you’re not even given the chance of messing with the other players, apart from starting a single war per turn with little to no consequences for your opponents.

This smells (and plays) like a badly-disguised Eurogame, not a civilization game.

I can see why some people would not like this game, however this flat out is the kind of game I love.  The theme, the artwork, the mechanisms all just fit so well. There is a ton of player interaction, with plenty of opportunities to mess with opponents.  This will probably end up being my pick of year for 2013, and I cannot wait to play more.

BTW, I did absolutely horrible my first play, and I still am absolutely in love with the game!!!

I purchased this game because I thought it would be a good alternative to Through the Ages. I've played it twice as a solo game and have been a bit disappointed. It seems to be pretty watered down when compared with Through the Ages, and everything just seems to happen too quickly. It is an alright game, but after playing it a few times I was wishing that I had bought Through the Ages instead. I still need to try it with more people (i.e. not just as a solo game), but so far this hasn't lived up to the hype for me.

Update: I ended up buying Through the Ages and that really showed me how lacking Nations really is. It falls short in every category and I ended up selling it at a major loss just to get the box out of my house. I would never recommend this game.

I didn't feel all the course of the game like I was playing something that raise over the average eurogame.

This can be a clear example of "easy hyped and open-hearted average gamer pleaser", most of you guys probably get impressed with Nations after the first play and rate it compulsively like a 9 rating game... but if you'd spend 2 minutes comparing its elegance with the good old classics, probably you would end rating it a more accurate 6 or 7.

Rating after one play. I haven't played Through the Ages yet, a game many seem to compare it to. This is obviously a well designed game and I recognize many of the comments others have mentioned:
- Yes, it feels a bit like balancing resource sliders;
- It's not a game for players that don't like careful planning;
- The military track seems too dominant to ignore at all;
- I didn't feel the runaway leader aspect, but it's certainly hard to recover from a mistake;
- The random events can have a huge impact on one player in particular. You can't even use the growth phase to mitigate the effects somewhat;
- It's pretty dry. I never had the feeling going through ages of developing civilizations.
- The visuals are hopelessly dated. Bland, generic, dreary artwork.

Would like to play this some more though.

Very interesting game, very much related to "Through the Ages." Veterans of TtA will recognize much here and many of the same considerations. Instead of fiddling with little teeny bits to track items, you are juggling chips of differing sizes and shapes. Someone has contributed a file to let you track your resources on a sliding scale which may make the accounting a little more transparent but it all comes down to personal preference. The cards that represent resource sources, leaders, wonders, and one time injections of resources all work very much the same. Here, instead of "happiness" one tracks "stability" so the similarities continue. This game features a set of event cards that can effect some or all of the players differently each turn and; of course, purchase cards that get refreshed each round that have differing costs depending on which row of the display they end up on.

The biggest difference I can see is the way player turns are managed. In TtA, you do everything you can playing cards and performing actions until you can't do any more then the next player does the same. Here however, each player takes a turn performing one action in rotation until players start to pass, with the round ending when all have passed. This "impulse action" scheme has become much the norm in modern designs and has the appearance of reducing downtime. The games will last just as long but players are "doing something" more continuously instead of waiting for other players to finish taking all their actions. The player mats have options for playing with generic factions (all the same) or using the tailored sides that have different characteristics that would play slightly differently which is a new wrinkle over TtA. 

The key question for me that I can't yet comment on is how differently the two games play. From my first play, it feels like the decisions one is making are just the same as in TtA in getting a functioning economy going and gradually improving it all aimed at garnering the maximum VPs at the end. If anything, this game has even more moving parts and is a very far, far cry from being a "TI-Lite." Frankly, at this stage, I can see no reason to buy this if you already have TtA. While quite similar, I don't see Nations as a big improvement - in fact maybe just the opposite, hence falling into the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it!" category for me. I have always regarded TtA very highly and Nations isn't different, compelling, or better enough for me to switch my allegiance from one to the other. It's not a bad game and I can see myself playing it but not enthusiastic enough to want to buy it.

Military path has overweight in our 5 player match. Once a player misses the stability or war demand, it could be the beginning of the end for that player. And then 2 turns no long expected miltitary card was be revealed and so this player went down the drain.
I need a 2nd match of Nations.

Very tight game where if you neglect an aspect of your civilization you will pay for each round.  Not enough military, prepare to lose every war if you can't get to the card first, not enough stability, expect everyone else to get something from the event except for you.  I don't mind negative effects in games but this just keeps beating you down and you are at the mercy of the card draw when trying to catch back up.

RATING: 4
I like the variety provided by the huge stack of cards they give you even though, as I'll get to later, the effects of the cards are mostly similar.  I also actually like the art style which has a rough watercolor quality, though I know many don't like it.  The game itself feels very solid and tight, with some choices of what strategy to pursue.  However you can't predict what cards will come up so the game ends up being almost entirely tactical.  You are just buying new cards and covering up older weaker ones and managing several currencies.  The turns all feel the same the numbers just get bigger on your cards and there is no real arc to the game.  It doesn't feel like you're making progress or building something.  The effects of the cards and the resources themselves are very abstract.  Most cards could have pretty much any name.  Battles, wars, and golden ages (essentially discoveries) are especially interchangeable.  I don't think this is particularly bad if you just think of it as a long tactical euro.  But I'm disappointed that the theme doesn't come through more.

Juegazo. Es una versión un poco más euro del TTA. Mas sencilla y facil de explicar, pero también con una profundidad de juego increible. No se juegan todas las cartas en cada partida, con lo que hay mucha rejugabilidad..

Nunca le diría que no. Aunque es más corto que el TTA, te puede llevar un rato. Mas de dos horas seguros. Otra diferencia loable: Admite hasta cinco jugadores. 

MUY RECOMENDABLE.

Tentative rating. The game looks promising, but need more plays to know for certain. Looking forward to new plays.
--------------------------
Rating increased to a 9. Eight plays in and the shine has not worn off yet. Quick games and tough decisions. It also works surprisingly well as a 2p game.
--------------------------
(...) and back to an 8. After getting more plays in it finally dawned on me this is an 'themeless' game of efficiency. Instead of buildings, armies or wonders, now I only see numbers. Still a good game, but not as good as I once thought it was.
--------------------------
(2016) ... and the rating goes up again if played with the Dynasties expansion. More nations and more cards are always welcomed, but the key point for me is finally making stability worth it! 

Summary: not the best civ game there is (that place is held firmly by Through the Ages), but a game I will seldom turn down.

For a game that visually is not that impressive this was quite interesting. I'm still a bit worried about the high amount of randomness in it, but I think on subsequent plays I will be able to combat it with a better strategy.

It will also take a while to see which aspects you can ignore, and which you should prioritize in each situation. I tried completely ignoring military in my first game, and it didn't work. You need it for at least a couple of colonies, otherwise they're just wasted slots.

---

I played it a few more times, and I now see how ignoring military could be a viable strategy, but you'd maybe have to ignore a few more things in order to make it work. If you don't want to buy wars it means you should probably forget about earning VPs that you could lose because of them, so no Golden Ages, and no focus on books. You'd also need enough balance to offset resource loss from wars.

This game has been compared to Through the Ages, often more favorably, as TtA is accused of being "fiddly." Well, in honesty the fiddly aspects of TtA are what make it great and distinctive. TtA might also be considered more of a gamer's game, as warring is much more brutal, there are fewer catch-up mechanisms, and you know you'll see every card in the game, allowing (theoretically) for more strategic play.

Now, I love TtA, but I must say I prefer Nations. Nations is great because it is not TtA. The card variety is lovely. Yes, it means that some games you'll see very few buildings, and some you'll see nothing but. This is a feature, not a detriment. The game scales incredibly well - I've played with almost every count (not 4, maybe), most often with 2 and with 5, and it's great at every number. The system is more flexible than TtA, in that you can get in and out of certain buildings without having to have foresight or feeling like you've burned a lot of time and resources for naught, but at the same time, good play will carry the day. It has a handicap system that actually works well. VPs are tight, as are resources. War is still powerful, and will generate rivalries, but it is not a game killer, and the damage can be mitigated. Getting new workers is key, but can be difficult; at the same time, it is possible to win without unlocking many of them. To do well, you must be flexible and understand that this is a tactical game, and that you are really playing era by era, rather than for the overall game span (don't ignore books, though, as I guarantee you'll get your lunch eaten). 

The real test is - does it hold my attention? Am I intensely immersed? Yes, every time I play, the outside world recedes. It is a very competitive, cut-throat game, but the mechanisms are simple and recognizable to anyone who plays Euros. No hype here, this is a straight-up masterpiece, and my favorite Civ game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good game, but this is no Through the Ages. All of the things that made TTA truly epic and stressful--the attack cards, seeding the event deck, setting up the final scoring, worrying about the corruption of resources and the happiness of your populace--are absent here. However, what you are left with is a still a fun, shorter, and significantly lighter game that scratches almost exactly the same itch as TTA. The art is, unfortunately, still pretty bad, and the graphic design still has a lot to be desired, but it's a good game. 

My biggest complaint is that the "books" track is severely underpowered in a two-player game. In fact, unless you are playing a 4-5 player game, there is little incentive to go strongly for books if you will only score 2-3 points per era with the majority. I'd like to see an expansion or an official 2-player rule variant that better incentivizes the book track.

RATING: 10
A great engine building game of juggling several resources.  You're seemingly always short on something, and trying to not any of the balls drop as you manage everything.  Just when you think you have things managed, someone will start a war or an event will come up that makes things tough again!

I love this sort of fight in a game, where I feel like I'm just on the edge of screwing up royally, so I really enjoyed the game play.

I extra super love that the game comes with tons of cards, so you only use a fairly small portion of them from game to game.  It adds a ton of variety from game to game, and I like games where players have to respond to what is available, rather than knowing exactly what will come.  While you can try to go in with an overall strategy in mind, you probably won't be able to follow it exactly due to necessary tactical decisions of making the best of the available options, and responding to the actions of other players and the events.

Overall, simply awesome stuff!  It will draw the obvious comparisons to Through the Ages, and even thought I really like TtA, this game likely replaces it for me due to the more logical nature of it that makes it easier to teach, explain, and play, while keeping all of the tough decisions and tension.

Only played one game so far, with 5 people. It's good, and I'm still learning, but it seems to me there needs to be a base set of things you can always do to improve, regardless of the cards that are drawn. For example, after an age of Farming, you should be able to be a little more efficient so you get an extra food. Just relying on the cards to improve gives the game a less strategic, more random feel.

A tedious slog, even with three players, that did nothing to erase the bad memories of playing Through the Ages. Find card combos in a brutal efficiency engine where the rich get richer for hours. With no pleasant thematic diversions that I could discern. 

The only question the game asks is how can I convert these seven resources into each other most efficiently? And there is lots of luck in the event draws for a game asking that question. Blah.

It’s inevitable to compare Nations to Through the Ages. They are both quite long civilization games without a map, and you buy cards from a common pool each round and place workers on (some of) these cards. A lot of people who love TtA don’t like Nations as they find it too simple, too short, too luck-based, not enough tension or elements of warfare etc. However, to me, these so-called “cons” are all “pros” in my book! Nations is a much more streamlined civilization game which is a hundred times easier to teach and play. It plays shorter, scales better and doesn’t really force you into a specific strategy (here I’m talking about the fact that if you neglect military completely, you will get hammered in TtA – this is not the case in Nations and it’s a huge improvement). Furthermore, in TtA, you can target a war specifically against one player, whereas in Nations everybody who hasn’t enough military lose a point and perhaps some resources, but not in the same devastating amount as in TtA. Yes, perhaps I’m exaggerating a little, but I really feel that the element of war is condensed and improved a lot in Nations.

This might sound as if I don’t enjoy TtA, but I do. I’ve rated it a 7.5 which is a nice rating compared to my average of 5.9... It’s just too long and too much focused on warfare, so that’s mainly why I prefer Nations - by far. Sure, Nations also has its flaws. The random way in which the cards come out and the fact that a bunch of cards never show up means that you might not get the cards you had been hoping for. In TtA, you know that each and every single card show up at some point, so you can plan for this and use a long-term strategy. In Nations, you need to adapt and make some short-term tactical moves, and while it can really suck that no colonies show up if you have a big military, it’s honestly rarely the case. But, granted, it is a random element which I’m not very fond of. The events each turn are also random, and it happen from time to time that you get screwed because for instance the turn order doesn’t change or the guy with most stability gets a point right after you’ve pulled an extra worker off the stability worker pool… 

Speaking of stability, I think it’s a clever game mechanic that you can mitigate the consequences of war if you have a stable civilization and go down the more peaceful route (and the fact that every player can start the only war each round means that a player with no military can prevent a military defeat if they buy the war first)! The player who has invested more into military will get a reward in terms of going first each turn, probably getting a reward from the events, not losing VPs to lost wars, get income from colonies and resources from battles. But the downside is that this player doesn’t get income from buildings, so the peaceful nations will get a good engine going. It’s a nice balance, and the great thing about the strategies is that you can always adapt and change! You’re not locked into a specific strategy if you chose that at the beginning of the game. Oh, and after more than 10 plays I feel that I can safely claim that military is not an overpowered strategy nor is any other strategy.

Another huge plus is that the elegance and simplicity of Nations. The game consists of 8 turns, and in each of those the players take one action out of three possible actions: buy a card, place a worker on a building/card, or grab an architect to help building your wonder… Yes, it’s that simple! But even so, you still need to think a lot about your decisions each turn (not that it leads to AP in my experience). The resources are also streamlined: you need food for some events, famine and to feed extra workers, you need gold to buy cards and you need stone to place workers on your buildings… Talk about elegant mechanics! There are also the books, which can net you between 0 and 16 points (or 8 in a 3 player game). That’s quite a bit, but again, you sacrifice other resources, so you always need to make a cost-benefit analysis. 
Of course there is some upkeep afterwards and some cleanup and such, but that doesn’t take too long each turn. Military and stability is also handled in a smart way as you instantly move the tracks up and down once you place/remove workers on cards. Clever.

Finally, it’s just awesome that you can play as different nations and on different difficulty levels - it’s a huge improvement on TtA and Clash of Cultures and other civ games! You have some unique powers as the civilization you choose, and they feel somewhat thematic (though the civs can quickly develop into non-thematic civs when you build hoplites in China and build the Pyramids in Greece etc.) I really love that you can choose your own difficulty level so experienced players don’t have too much of an advantage. I’ll have to say, though, that the experienced player still will win most of the games even when playing on the tough difficulty levels like king and emperor; the key is that if the events go their way, they can just take a worker instead of 1-2 resources each turn (as opposed to 3-4 resources on the easier difficulty levels), and then the so-called disadvantage is cancelled and cease to exist.

Judging by the components you get, the price tag for this game is kind of steep. But in my opinion it’s the gameplay you pay for, and I think it’s a reasonable price when you consider this, as it’s such a great game! It should also be quite easy to make an expansion, and I’m fairly sure one will be published eventually.
My final thoughts on Nations are that it works better with 4 players than with 2, but it does work very well across the different number of players. 2, 3 and 4 all work well; I haven’t tried the solo variant yet, but that’s mainly because I don’t play many solo games (Agricola, my number one game, being the only one). It’s a long-ish game with 4, but it’s not too bad as the game takes about 30-40 minutes per player!

My 2nd contender for top Essen 2013 game, slightly behind Madeira.

Through the ages without the direct conflict and more streamlined sums up Nations. I like both and can justify having both. Awesome game, but I don't think I can rate it a 10, at least not yet. I think the game needs just a little more variety to push it over. Lots of the cards feel kind of similar, even if they are actually different. The game is a common Euro with all the resources production it has with a Civ feel. I really like that there is an alternative choice to military in this game, which is hard to find in a civilization game. It also plays Solo, and I really like that.

I had been eyeballing Nations... not to buy it, but simply to play it. Comments identifying it as Through the Ages 2.0 perked my interest, as I liked a good portion of TtA, but some of its drawbacks ultimately left me not wanting to play it any more.

Compared to TtA, Nations is quicker, more streamlined, less punishing, and possibly a bit more random. There's still the card drafting to build your empire, with buildings, leaders, wonders, wars, etc. It all fits very well together, and I enjoyed my one play.

Straight up, I'd gladly play this again and avoid future plays of TtA.

Negative points though for a laughable box size and cost that exceeds what you get in the box.

Update: this is a solid civ game, especially with the expansion. I can't say whether or not I like this more than Through the Ages at this point... both have their pros and cons.

RATING: 9
Best "Civilization"-like game I've seen so far. The lack of a map to play on is greatly compensated by a play mechanism that feels natural to play (almost like Agricola) and at every moment there are tough decisions to make. War is abstract and is mainly used to make the other players loose resources, not for conquest. Although you can colonize it's mainly done to obtain resources (ore, grain, coins, tech military skills etc.) With 4 players we manage to finish a game in 3 hrs.

Give up TtA and play this with fast pace!  
# 20140430
The game flow is smooth and elegant.  This game can be used to replace the TtA (only from my point of view because of the downtime).  But the war of this game is too overwhelming. The only way to deal with the war seeker is to spend action to start a war.  Stability can be used to avoid the consequence of the war but the pace is far too slow while you are developing your nations and support your army.  Another reasons are the artwork and the quality of the games that make me disappointed.
The solo playing is not bad but the cards coming and the events are far too random.  The whole game playing is not something like to develop a nation in full strength but to find a way to avoid the consequence of the events.

# 20140501
This game play is totally forced to be followed the military path. If you wanted to play differently and decided to forgo military, you would be utterly devastated. Every turn we seemed to lose resources because of military preparation, so could essentially do nothing all game. The game became one big mess. We seldom used additional workers (meeples) because all resources and productivity used up in war and events. 
 
The quality of game also makes me very disappointed!!!!

Vladda called - he wants his game back! Seriously though, think of this as a stripped-down Through the Ages and you're most of the way there. There are four rounds/ages...you buy cards from a central row which represent technologies, buildings and wars...you build wonders (and these do not require workers). The list goes on.

Before I start sounding too negative though, this is a good game if you thought Vladda's TTA was too aggressive, or took a bit too long. It's a more streamlined, efficiency-euro type experience. You also don't have to wait for the other players to do ALL their actions before you get a chance - it's one action (buy a card, place a worker on a building, or costruct a wonder), then onto the next player. A very welcome change.

RATING: 5
Not a TTA clone, exactly, but it's indisputably enough of an effort to address the same basic ideas that intellectual honesty pretty well demands a head to head comparison. 

So, for the record: it does some things well that TTA does not. For one thing, it's considerably pacier -- a table full of experienced hands (especially not cursed with AP) could crack out even a 4-5 player game in three hours, I suspect. It actually manages to mine the entire history of the world for some genuinely interesting color which makes the game feel a little less like an optimization puzzle with a handwavey history-of-the-word theme. The production is fine; the iconography is clear, although the text is annoyingly small, and I actually thought the artwork (which some people loathe for some reason) is charming. The game overall is more straightforward and less fiddly than TTA.

(A minor point, but one worth noting, is that Nations also makes a more concerted effort to be more global in its scope, incorporating historical figures and other elements from Asia, Africa and the pre-Columbian Americas, as opposed to the relentless Eurocentrism of TTA; this is subtle enough that I'm reluctant to even bring it up lest I froth up the sort of people who complain about PC TYPES RUINING EVERYTHING by committing the sin of pointing out that, say, Korea has a history. But, y'know, the hell with those people.)

That said, my initial effort at the game was a slog that left me unengaged. Progress is slow and incremental for the most part and early mistakes can leave you gasping for air without hope of relief. The greater variety of cards gives the game color and a sort of replayability but it can also leave you in a situation where you just can't hope to collect the resources you need for the strategic direction you planned for early on; in a more fluid tableau-builder like Pax Porfiriana you can pull your opponents back with a clever inversion of the strategic situation, and in a game like Race For The Galaxy, it's over before you get to the point where you feel like a dead man walking. In TTA you know that what you need is EVENTUALLY coming down the pike. In Nations you sometimes need to just sit back and take it. For two hours or more, that's just a bridge too far for me.

I'm trying to keep an open mind on this title; I've been pleasantly surprised by tableau builders in the past, after further reflection. But my initial experience of this game has me longing to play something with a little more player-interaction meat on its bones.

Words cannot describe how much I hated this game. Thankfully I bought it heavily discounted, otherwise I would be furious now. The cheapest and ugliest production of all the games I have ever owned. Theme is just very hastily pasted on, no effort has been put to match the buildings with their produce thematically (the Parliament produces as much ore as the factory?!). The choices you make also make no sense thematically. The game mechanics feel like a sad mash-up borrowed from other games. The only reason for this game's success is that there's a huge audience for civilization games who don't have 5 hours to spare for a Through the Ages game but this is by no means a suitable alternative.

I honestly didn't think I was going to make it through the initial setup, there was just so much. Chits! Cubes! Little cards that need to be separated and separated and separated again! But then I started reading the rules, and whaddya know? Everything clicked so darn quickly. I played with a partner who shouldn't be considered any kind of advanced gamer, yet she got how to play quickly, too. We ended up having a blast, though we called the game after two ages (halfway through) since we'd already played two hours. I'm sure future games would half that time. And I can say for sure that I would like to play again.

Very much enjoyed playing it. It is ugly but fun. Taking an action one by one sounds simple but it is so deep. It is not a easy game at all.
I did like you have almost always more than one possible action what will benefit you at the end of the round. And it is variable so you can replay it many many times without being the same.
However it is extremely long.  And usually I don't complain about AP but god I won't play this ever with slow players.

For now a 7.5 but I guess it can improve as the game, obviously, needs to be played a couple of times more in order to better understand its value.

This is a copy of TTA but I prefer Nations because turns are much shorter. It takes some courage to publish a game like one already in the market. I really don't know what to think of it.

2nd play, and I still don't like it all.  Confirmed.  I will not play this again.  Problems I have with this game:

The rich get richer.  If you get behind, there is very little you can do to recover.
It is TTA, but does't do anything better, really.

What I do like:

Alternating turns is nice for downtime
The way wars are handled (not a fan of wars in TTA) -- though, played late, they can screw people just as much).


What we probably did wrong:

Didn't play enough wars.

I was really excited about this game, and then I tried it.  It is just too similar to Through the Ages, and it doesn't distinguish itself enough to make me want to play this over TTA.  Yes, it is shorter, but the gameplay experience is not good enough to merit the shorter gameplay time to sacrifice the better time.

A game clearly inspired by TTA, but just didn't go far enough to distinguish itself as its own game.

Better than I expected. Not as deep as Through The Ages, but flows 10x better. Turns are fast, simple. But there is a LOT lost in the way cards flow down from expensive to cheap. It seems a little weird that cards that cost both 1 and 2 bucks all come in and go out together. Workers have a huge upkeep cost. Given that, colonies and wonders (which don't require workers) are even more valuable than they might appear at first. Since colonies require a minimum military force, you really don't have a viable option to ignore military. Sure, you can mitigate the effects of war with stability, but there is still no substitute for getting early colonies. EVen though I think TTA is clearly the better game, I'm actually almost never in the mood to slog through it anymore, so Nations may be a reasonable alternative..

Instead of thinking how to beat your opponents or discussing options, you are busy staring at the cards and thinking how to combine this many items of that color.

This one is tied with TtA for me.  They both do things that the other doesn't.  I would play Nations when I'm in the mood for a longer simpler game.  I love the fact that there's solo play, and a handicap system.  You don't really so much feel like your civ building as in TtA but what you get with this one is a fun ride of increasing efficiency of your engine.  But, it's always at the expense of something else.  You might get an X+Y building and replace it with a X+X+Z building.  Interesting problems to solve, and with the lower player counts, all the cards won't come out which causes all players to constantly think tactically.  I like this one.

In other words, many different ways to play Nations and to include different types of players all in one game. Superb civ game. Favorite civ game.

Not only that but it also has a solo mode! Yeah I don't think I would enjoy it that much but it is still a very unique perk.

Interesting and satisfying, but probably too long for its own good. I guess it's Terraforming Mars case which has exactly the same problem. Besides that, it's a good game, surprisingly quite thematic as you actually feel that your civilization grows. Military and stabilisation tracks are worth noticing, as they indiciate your possibilities to conquest various colonies and determine the amount of losses you take when losing a war, for example. War cards are very interesting on their own as they add a nice dose of negative interaction which is just enough for that type of game - and it's indirect, thing I guess is good for an euro game. That type of interaction forces you to change plans rather than striking you directly. Events may be a little bit unforgiving and punishing, but sometimes rewarding as well(for some players). They add a thematic flavour and are mechanically excellent too, because they force players to race in certain fields(resources, military, stabilisation etc.). At first look the game could feel like multiplayer solitaire, but thanks to the mechanisms mentioned above it really isn't.

What I like about Nations is that the game flows smoothly and is kinda light, despite there are several connections between various things, tracks and cards. The rules are simple and straightforward, as in most of the cases it's buy a card or send a worker to a card. Of course there is resource management, creating interactions between cards, keeping tracks of military and stabilisation and so on, but overall it's not really brainburning. However, after 3 hours it gets a little bit tiring and players just want the game to end already. 

All in all, I'm not really sure about the rating, as I feel it could be 8. It's really a nice civilization/engine building game with historical flavour. Adding assymetry between factions could enhance the positive feelings even more - for me it was only the first game so we just played with the same starting cards and resources. I definitely want to try it again, but I guess it's a game to play once in 2-3 months, not more often.

It's hard to wrap my head around this game. It felt like you could control the speed of four different race cars on four different tracks and you wanted to be closer to the finish line than your opponents on most of them every round. I did have a good time playing it and it was easy to pick up. Not for those prone to analysis paralysis though. 

Also not much of a theme or story either. I didn't feel like I was building a civ so much as managing a bunch of tracks.

A dopey game that can be fun to play but has big flaws. Whenever I play I keep thinking I should get Through the Ages back to the table...this is shorter and simpler, but has dumb and unthematic restrictions and still makes military too dominant. And the random distribution of cards means a game can go off the rails due to lack of something someone badly needs but through no fault of their own they can't get. It's a game that actively, and randomly, screws players. The expansion makes this problem worse. I have friends who love this game, and it's fun if you don't get screwed, but I'll pass.

This has pretty good potential to be an entertaining game, and in fact, I enjoyed the first half of it. The problem I encountered was that it is very difficult to pull out of a losing position. I was living hand-to-mouth, and despite taking the Battles cards to get resources, I was getting knocked down again and again from the events. Will have to play more to see if this is just a result of incredibly poor play on my part, but I have my doubts. 

In Through the Ages, it feels easier to overcome a deficiency in a particular resource. Since the Battles cards are tied to one's military, if you aren't strong, then you won't benefit as much from them. Plus, you might not even get to take the card you need, as you will be going last in the turn. And then you will get smacked around by the events...

I played the Persia B side (chosen randomly), and their bonus is an extra space for a colony. Thinking to capitalize on this, I focused on getting extra workers and building military. However, the starting tech (Axemen) provides only 2 military, so I would need 3 workers on there to colonize even the weakest colony. By the time I was strong enough, other players (whose military techs were worth 3 military each) beat me to the colony cards. Meanwhile, I have these military units who are eating up my resources, and extra population eating up my food, and you can see the downward spiral... And the colonies only get stronger! Agh!

Update: Second play, and this time with beginner cards and Side A boards, and the result was much better management and balance. I still find the game to be very reactionary, rather than developing a strategy and letting it run for a bit. The severity of the events means players have their turn pretty much mapped out for them, and it just comes down to what cards to take to reach that short-term goal. 

Update 2: Third play in, and I'd rather not play this game again. Just doesn't do it for me.

RATING: 7
Primarily card driven and resource management. Doesn't feel like civ building.

Highly replayable and seems balanced. Multiple game modes and difficulty levels for handicaps and challenge.

Interactive due to importance of turn order in grabbing cards and balancing military and buildings against your opponents.

Game events also works against you and you must manage both your civ's military and stability track against the knowledge track for points.

Has workers but not really a worker placement game and more of an action selection game. Fairly long with 12 rounds that do not go through the modern age.

Simplified version of Through the Ages.

Nations is a very clean, tight euro strategy game.  Though there are plenty of other games out there like it, Nations does a very good job of making the standard euro style empire building game a very clean but also challenging experience.  The game has plenty of depth to it considering all the options the players will have to choose from.  And knowing every move will be vital to your success.  Like i said, a very 'tight' game.  An veteran should never lose to a first time player, but a match between two experienced foes is always a nail biter.  All in all a game that may not be as unique as others, but gets a very high grade for it's design and execution.

This game has a huge number of similarities to Through the Ages... and I've seen it called "Through the Ages Lite". However, it's not really light at all... only a little lighter than Through the Ages.

For the moment, I'm giving it an '8'. I'm feeling that Through the Ages is clearly the better game--but Through the Ages is a top-10 classic.

Since Nations is so similar to Through the Ages, I'd fear that I'd end up trading it... but because it supports 5 players, that alone will be reason enough to keep it.

EDIT: After another play, I'm convinced that actually playing this game is just as difficult as Through the Ages. Nations is easier to learn, but the full game of Nations (with 5 players) seems every bit as difficult as anything I've ever dealt with in Through the Ages. I'm bumping my rating up. Serious brain-burn and some really good excitement in the most recent session.

I actually really like this game, despite TtA being one of my favorites.  I can't suggest one over the other, as you should really try both.  TtA has been my favorite Civ game for years, but this is definitely up there now as well.  Setup is a little faster than TtA, and I would expect in a 2P game the play is about 20 min faster than TtA, and then add another 20 min faster for each additional player (i.e. in a 4 player game I would expect this to play about an hour faster).

Favorite/least favorite mechanism or gameplay note.
+My favorite thing about this game was how the military/war/battle system worked. 
-My least favorite thing about this was the inclusion of the books/knowledge track.  They were pretty easy to acquire and it seemed that picking a military that removed books every production phase rather than another resource (grain/coal/stability) was a HUGE advantage.

Either way, other than that minor complaint this was a really fun game that is easy to understand once you 'get over the hump'

One of many mega-sized civilization themed games, this one from Finland dispenses with maps, and does its civ building with cards, charts, and pieces. The system is solid, though requires some attention to master. Just enough specific references to avoid Euro abstraction: you play Greece, Rome, Egypt, Persia or China and their heirs, the leaders are real people, and the pyramids look like pyramids.

Nations is heavily inspired by Through the Ages (TTA), a game that I really like but that never hits the table. The reasons for this are manifold: There are a lot of (sometimes fiddly) rules, TTA is quite heavy with a lot to learn strategy-wise and a game of TTA is a real time investment. For TTA to shine, you really need to play it over and over again. But since I can't find people that share my interest in TTA, all it does is collecting dust. 

So when I heard of Nations, marketed as a streamlined version of TTA, I had high hopes. For the most part, my expectations have been fulfilled: In contrast to TTA, explaining Nations is a breeze. After one round, everyone should be on board. Nations is not difficult to understand and most of the fiddly parts of TTA have been removed. Especially the "you take only one action then it's the next player's turn" was a great design choice, it simply doesn't take ages until it's your turn again. And like in TTA, it's a joy to balance all the different resources in the game. It's just a very satisfying ride from start to finish.

So, why didn't I rate it higher than TTA? What Nations lacks is the spark of genius (in game design) that TTA has and that I hugely admire and enjoy whenever I get the chance to play it. There are so many ingenious ideas in TTA, such as the seeding of the event deck, that I felt I had to rate Nations a tad lower.

Complex decisions, which can't be tackled fully until you see what the player before you does, make Nations drag on way too long at all player counts, but especially with more than 2.

What I wanted from Nations was pretty much what I got: Through the Ages without the direct player v. player aggression.  Sure, it has plenty of differences from its predecessor; I'll still want to play TtA.  And yeah, there are still ways to sort of direct a war at one player or another (if multiple war cards are available).  But that aspect is better in Nations, more fun.  One quibble that may keep it from attaining the highest highs for me is that I didn't feel like the various upgrade cards were all that exciting most of the time.  You had to go to the wonders to really break rules, usually.  But that's a minor fault, if at all.  I quite liked this game and am looking forward to playing again.

First, this is a long game.  probably longer than it should have been, as we had 2 rookies (me included) playing it, but I can see that even with familiarity, this will drag on.  All through the game I was pretty well convinced that I was losing but at the end I was in 3rd place by only 5 points.  I really like games where the winner isn't clear until the final scoring.  That alone raises my rating to a 7.  I also enjoyed the fact that you will probably never see the same combination of cards from one game to the next, so there's lots of replay value.  

Overall, a pretty neat game, but one that needs a large block of time set aside for it.

A somewhat more streamlined version of Through the Ages. However, the fact that there's no track to keep account of the food, stone, and gold you generate each turn made for a bookkeeping nightmare for me.

RATING: 8
Players guide an ancient empire through four "ages" of advancement, trying to score the most victory points.

Players on their turn take one of three actions - purchase a card off the drafting board; recruit a worker into an owned building; hire an architect to work on a wonder of the world.  Repeat until all have passed, and do this for 8 turns spread across four ages.

This can be best described as Through The Ages, ported to an action impulse system.  The game play is quite similar - purchase cards, port your population onto them to generate an engine, etc.  However, the mechanics are now take a single action, then pass the turn around the table, rather than wait for every other player to take a complete turn before the action comes back to you.  On top of that, each turn there are two or three mini-competitions taking place with rewards and penalities applied to the nations with the most/least of certain resources.

The sum of this is the game feels faster than Through The Ages, and indeed it may be, but it is still quite a long game, especially with four or five players.  Still, the fast "take 1 action" game play keeps you involved and interested, and there is literally no downtime as you play the game.  

The victory conditions are tighter as well - instead of building up a Through The Ages like culture engine, and slapping down some hidden goal victory points at the end of the game, here you are in a cut-throat stuggle for victory points, which are a rare commodity and each one matters.  A score of 40 may well win the game here.

Through The Ages is a top 10 game for me - I adore it.  This too is an excellent game and may yet take its place.  I am still exploring the basic game - I haven't flipped the boards over to the alternate setup sides, or tried the other two tiers of cards yet.  So, much to explore, but my first three games have been excellent.  High hopes for this one.

Kipróbáltam egyedül 3 játékost irányítva. Jól elhúzódott a történet, mert nehéz volt úgy játszani, hogy ne vegyem nagyon figyelembe a különböző játékosaim stratégiáit. Így is sikerült különböző módon fejlesztenem őket, függetlenül attól, hogy direkt a játékostáblák 'A' oldalát használtam. Volt amelyik "aranytermelőre" sikerült, volt amelyik a stabilitást "maxolta ki" a játék végére (habár a haderőre egyáltalán nem koncentrált) és volt amelyik a haderőt preferálta eredményesen. Végül az utóbbi nyert 41-38-37 arányban. Azt olvastam valahol, hogy hasonlít a Saint Petersburg játékhoz. Valóban a fejlődéskártyák tekintetében észre lehet venni némi hasonlóságot, de a játék azért egészen más. Eddig még nem játszottam civilizációépítő játékkal, így ez nekem egy külön élmény volt, ahogy láttam a birodalom fejlődését. Habár én inkább azt vettem észre, hogy egy nagy nyersanyag menedzselés a játék, mert hogyha valamilyen erőforrás hiányba keveredtem, akkor mindig lehetett találni egy épület, csoda, tanácsadó és még ide sorolnám a csata lapot is (habár ahhoz szükség van a haderőre), amivel kisebb megakadás után tovább lehetett fejlődni. A könyveknek nem éreztem akkora szerepét, habár lehet azért nem, mert alapvetően biztonsági játékos vagyok, aki nem szeret kifutni a meglévő nyersanyagokból, pedig szerintem néha megérte volna a kockázatot. A szabályok megértéséhez kétszer kellett elolvasnom a szabálykönyvet, hogy minden teljesen letisztuljon, viszont a segédletet játék közben is nagyon jól lehetett használni és egy játék után úgy érzem, hogy a szabályok egyáltalán nem bonyolultak, amennyiben felfogjuk a stabilitás szerepét, a háború lefolyását, teendőket a nyersanyag hiány esetén és a többi már egészen egyértelmű (ha már több komolyabb társasjáték is van mögötted :)). Talán még a kártyák kavarhatnak be egy keveset, de ebben is segít a hivatalosan kiadott FAQ. Ráadásul a magyar szabályt már az Errata-val is kibővítették, így azt teljesen feleslegesen olvastam el külön is :). A szabály kitér az első játék alkalmával betartandó ajánlásokra, amiből szerintem csak a saját játéktáblák 'A' oldalának használatát érdemes figyelembe venni. A kártyák meg hadd biztosítsanak változatosabb fejlődési lehetőségeket. Emlékszem az Agricola-nál is figyelembe vettem az ajánlást és csak az "egyszerű" pakli lapjait használtuk, amit végül megbántam, mert amíg az egyik játékosnak a 14 lapjából 8-9 is teljesen hasznosnak bizonyult, addig én örültem, hogy végül 4-et ki tudtam játszani, mert a többit nem találtam annyira előnyösnek. Tehát visszatérve a Nations-re, hadd menjenek a kártyák, én nem találtam közöttük egyet sem, ami bármiféle nehézséget okozna, habár azt hozzá kell tenni, hogy körülbelül a negyedét sem láttam :). Többet játszó családoknak bőven ajánlanám, akik nem riadnak vissza a hosszabb játékidejű játékoktól, habár a szabályban erre is van egy ajánlás, miszerint abba lehet hagyni, előre megbeszélés alapján, a harmadik korszak végén is, habár én nem korlátoznám a birodalom teljes kivirágzását :). (2015.08.30.)
Ha egy gondolkodós társaság játszik vele, akkor nagyon el tud húzódni. Nekünk be kellett fejezni a Reneszánsz kor után időszűke miatt, így is négyen több mint 3 órát játszottunk. Ráadásul a szabály magyarázatnál elfelejtettem a háború szabályait részletesen elmagyarázni, így nem volt teljesen tiszta, hogy a fekete háború jelölő nem mozog, ha a háborút kirobbantó játékos hadereje változik, illetve ami még fontosabb, elfelejtettem, hogy a stabilitás csökkenti a háború veszteségit. A játékélmény még mindig kiváló. A hosszú játékidő ellenére egyáltalán nem vettük észre az idő múlását, mert mindenki élvezte a birodalom építését. Érdemes az éhezésre odafigyelni, mert könnyen bajba kerülhet, aki nem számol vele. (2015.08.31.)

RATING: 7
In some ways, a much-improved version of Through the Ages.  Gives a decent civ feel, as you push resources around and collect cards, but still pretty abstract.  It's not as punishing as TtA: there's no way to directly attack someone, and even the wars aren't crushing.  The events can be brutal, however, and being behind on the military or order tracks may result in severe penalties.  Growth is tough, as well, since any citizen that you activate imposes a cost for the rest of the game.  You really have to plan well, since leaving yourself short of rock will mean that you can't activate the new buildings you buy and being broke means that you can't buy cards.  Both can be crippling, so you really don't want to wind up losing a turn that way.
What felt unbalanced to me was just the way that the cards came out onto the display.  There always seems to be at least one war available, so I think there are slightly too many of those (as you only ever need one per turn).  Other crucial cards, like new buildings, military units, battles, etc. may be in short supply.   You may be hurting in a particular area, but if the card display isn't cooperating, you won't be able to fix the problem.  If you want to play at the top level with all the cards, I recommend going through them and separating by type (there are either 8 of the more common types like buildings or 4 of the less common types like wars per tier).  Once that's done, shuffle the types separately, then put the right number from each pile into the deck for that age and shuffle again.  It's time-consuming, but does result in a better distribution than having a massive deck.
Wonders are kind of problematic as well, and I don't know if they're really worth buying a lot of the time.  That's because architects are very scarce, and if the other players decide to fight you for them, you'll never be able to get the thing built in a timely manner.
I don't know if military is too important, but it's certainly not something you can continually ignore.  Not only does it determine turn order, but it's the only way to buy colony cards.  You'll definitely want to get some of those before long, as they're free resource production.  There does seem to be an ebb and flow to the game, though.  It's not always just the same player sitting at the top of the track, since new cards will come out and other players will prioritize being in first place.
Anyway, there's a few oddities, but I kind of like it all the same.

Love Nations.  It's a lighter less fiddly version of Through the Ages.  It handles the civ engine with grace and simplicity but still hangs on to the theme of developing Rome to conquer the world.  

Plays well with 2 as it does with 4 with the variant and also has a difficulty setting which is awesome when playing with my wife or new players.  If you like civilization and want it somewhat streamlined this is the way to go! Excellent!

Having never played Through The Ages I came to this clean. And I was mightily impressed. We only played the game with the base cards but that was more than enough to be going on with. It is a really clever game and very involving. Card selection drives military or resource collection, and how many meeples you pay to come and sit on your cards determines how strong the cards become. Balancing income with resource generation and military strength is a fine art here. My only criticism would be with the length as we played for 4 hours, and even allowing for the fact that it was our first time I can't see this easily coming in under 3 hours. Oh and perhaps the event cards are a bit extreme at times and you can get hit badly by them at a time when it is not possible to escape their effects. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to exploring it further.

Great medium civilization building simulation similar to TTA but simpler. The core mechanic of the game is the progress card offer from which players buy the card they wish, place them on their sheet and add workers or architects to them. Each card is unique, thematically perfect and historically accurate and there is around 300 of them for 4 different ages. Every age is divided in 2 rounds, each round refreshes card offer and brings new events (which set the mini goals of the round) and every second round there is mini scoring with full blown scoring in the end.
There is also only 3 types of resources and 3 progress scales to maintain which is the simplest it can get for civilization game.
It can be played up to 5 or even solo and it's still fun.
Just brilliant. Good work Finnish designers, again.

This takes its place along side Through the Ages as a top-notch civ game.  I believe there is plenty of room on the shelf for both (even though the box for Nations is huge).  No reason not to have both of them.

really like this game it is kind of long tho.  The best part of the game is battling yourself.  By that I mean you want to do so much but based on what the other players do and the events you never really get that opportunity.  I feel like as a civ game this is not the norm, but it feels right for some reason.

This game has been played twice. However, the box is a little bit beat up; I bought it from my FLGS at a 10% discount because of shelf wear on the box. A couple of the cards are a little dinged (though nothing that would be especially noticeable or problematic while playing the game). It was never treated badly, but the box and components are pretty flimsy. Pictures can be taken/sent upon request.

The best Civ style game I own.  While I agree TTA is a better (competitive) game, I find Nations to be far more fun to play.  It's far less scripted then TTA and things can get quite brutal if luck is against you, but it's also more organic.  I'm also a fan of the built in balancing (handicapping) system.  Best at 3-4 players (5 players takes way to long).

ok - after a 1/2 dozen plays or so, its hard to rate this game. its very enjoyable to play. a good bit of think and a decent amount of gamers 'chicken' going on, all based around the valuation of civ cards. 

that said, experience tells me that more often than not the final outcome is determined by the luck of the 'event deck draw'. yes the events occur prior to your actions, but since specialization in one of the 2 event tracks with luck means you win, and bad luck means you lose... yes you can middle but from the middle you just finish in the middle.

so i'm torn. i enjoy the game, i enjoy the playing of it, but i just get frustrated by my 'play' being overcome by the 'luck of the draw'.

Based on my half dozen plays (all 2 player) Nations is a good game.  There are some very challenging decisions and trade offs to make as the game progresses and the 2 player game can be quite punishing if you fall behind.  My wife has my measure at this one well and truly. I suspect it will be even better with 3 players.

A decent homage to Through the Ages, Nations feels like there's more interaction between players, but ultimately everyone is struggling to produce enough resources while purchasing a random tide of cards. Tough, but definitely feels like a civ builder.

You have to manage your scarce resources well and that's not easy. Dropping too low on Stability or Military could cost you resources and points, gathering books will eventually give you points.

The events make this game more tactical than strategic, there's a lot going on and downtime is limited because of the one-action-per-turn mechanism.

It's a constant struggle for stability and power and you will always want to do more than you actually can.

Great game!

I'm torn on this game as I expected it to be more exciting. There are some intelligent design choices, but the game seems more about developing an efficiency engine and due to tedious bookkeeping & re-checking each round, high card randomness, a feed your people obligation (usually benign), harsh artwork (especially the portraits - yikes!), extremely tight resource management, and a 4th age which drags at the 3 hr mark, I was left somewhat underwhelmed.  Ultimately, the theme never came through anywhere near as strong as I had hoped (all eras more or less play and feel the same) and there is no story arc or narrative.  It's more puzzly than epic and there are some very gamey cards and non-thematic designs for effect:  why can I only have 5 buildings? Why only 1 advisor or 2 colonies at one time?  Why does my military strength go from the best in game down to to zero the instance I develop a military advancement?  Why do wars get progressively more costly while employment costs increase so much?  Why does the parliament produce as much stone as the factory? Many cards are various tweaks on production and by the 4th age, everyone's just scouring the board for maximum victory point generating opportuinties.

I haven't played Golden Age, nor the 4hr Through the Ages to compare yet, but I probably prefer 7 Wonders or Deus instead.

UPDATE:   TTA is a card-based civ builder, but somewhat a different game.  I can see Nations probably easier to get to the table for me, but TTA has a definite narrative and story arc as your empire really grows and the ages feel like progress.

RATING: 7
Through the Ages light. *Much* easier to learn, *much* quicker, but much less elegant, much less engrossing. I never feel as connected to my civilization as I do when playing Through the Ages, and I can never managed to feel imperilled in this game. You can play *extremely* poorly throughout, and then recoup a TON of points at the end from population, wonders, loyalty, etc. (I did exactly this last game I played, and came in a close second to a player who played an almost flawless game). So, not very balanced. Also, there's surprisingly little difference between building options, which makes any particular decision to buy one feel just kind of 'bleh'. There's a "might as well" feeling to most decisions you end up making. Point tallying at game-end is ridiculous. I think this is in part why its hard to develop a connection to what you're building. You don't feel like your building something distinct and customized; you merely feel like you're building what you need to build in order to make the most resources.

It gets points for being a civ game -- they're just fun by default -- and for snagging a bunch of great mechanics from Through the Ages. To the extent that Nations might introduce a few more people to Through the Ages, I applaud it. Otherwise, it's just kind of flat.

Good civilization building game. Turns are nicely broken up so you don't sit around while others execute 10+ minute turns. It still takes a while to play, especially when introducing new players. So we normally only play three ages instead of four. Huge replayability even without the two included expansion decks.

The reason I don't rate this higher is beacuse of the lack of satisfaction. I never feel like I've built up an empire. Everything is very costly and the return on investment is very slim.

Then there's the randomness in the card types that come out. It's hard to plan ahead because you don't know if any wonders, colonies, military units, wars, or even buildings show up.

It's not the biggest issue, but the game is also very bland looking.

Nations actually has a lot of unexplored potential, but the theme and style of gameplay did not appeal to us. The art was nice and I appreciated how the game was a straight up engine builder, but we felt no immersion. It was very superficial and I did not feel like I was building a civilization at any point really. The game probably gets better with more plays but there are other engine building games we enjoy more.

RATING: 4
I get what the design was going for in terms of the tension of the card display in TtA, but reducing the game to that one element removes far too much. Furthermore, if you're going to tilt the game this heavily towards the card drafting, then the cards need to be far, far more differentiated so at to provide different paths. A good counter-example is Lewis & Clark that I also recently tried; there, the cards offer very different benefits and ways to go about your business. The cards in Nations were very mild upgrades and differences from previous ones. 

You aren't rewarded for going down any particular path because all new cards must be paid for in full, so even though you have a military unit, that new one will cost you the same it costs a player who has no military. This is a huge diff from TtA, of course, and the result is, ostensibly, the flexibility to buy any card at any time and shift gears easily. The price for that is any sense of investment in your "civilization." 

There still is a heavy emphasis on military here which I thought was what they wanted to nerf from TtA? Military cards got drafted first due to the ability to raid and colonize as well as the ability to stay in first place so you could take more military cards. Raids are very beneficial in game boons, and colonies score at game end without having to be manned. I mean, there's even more of a military slant in this game than TtA. At least let the player last in military go first, for heaven's sake!

I have conflicted feelings about this game. I truly wish I could like it more, as it has several ideas and mechanics that I enjoy. But... military (red) cards are just too powerful. I haven't played many games, but I honestly never saw anybody who ignored their military for a non-insignificant amount of time winning. This tends to lead to a runaway leader problem as well: if only a few (or, God forbid, one) military cards show up at a certain point of the game, the person with the strongest military (which means the person that goes first, as military strength determines initiative) can take them and consolidate their advantage. I really do not know...

Ordered this and waiting for shipment. I had a chance to play this in the club. It was a blast. The game is much more streamline and less fiddle than Through the Ages. It is complex enough for real gamers. The theme is solid. The gameplay is intense and decision is difficult. The War cards create a lot of player interactions on card drafting and militarization timing. The Architect cubes and Wonders also create nice player interactions.

This game has a lot of great things going for it, but I've seen a couple of games "spoiled" by players screwing somebody over after they passed.

I'm starting to think that civ games just aren't really for me.

RATING: 10
I'm going to say it, this is a far better experience then Through The Ages.  It takes half the time, has half the rules, is far more streamlined and elegant and is far more balanced.  I like the double sided player boards, with the A sides all being the same regardless of which civilisation you choose and the B sides being unique.  I also love the sense of escalation and the feeling that you are really building towards something, without having to rely on any one strategy or fear getting the sh*t slapped out of you.  War and conflict is quite abstract but easily explained and not a dominating factor, just one of a lot of small finely balanced features that fit together like a Swiss watch.

The only complaints that I have mostly relate to the components, which are mediocre at best and poor at worst.  Plus the box is unnecessarily large for what is inside.

Lastly, there can be some variety issues at lower player counts, with a card distribution that may become unbalanced if you are using all of the cards with less than 4 players.  There is a way to solve this: removing the expert cards means more of the deck will be used therefore guarantying a more even spread, although you do potentially rob yourself of some of the more interesting cards.

Juegazo. Impresionante. De lo mejor de lo mejor. 
14.2.2015 - Subo de 9 a 9.5. Hoy por hoy es mi juego favorito. La tensión que tiene, las múltiples posibilidades, la cantidad de estrategia... Juegazo increíble que ha logrado que nos juntemos Juan, Ignations y yo cada viernes sin falta para escribir un nuevo capítulo de la historia de las civilizaciones.

EDITO: Desde que se fue Ignations apenas habíamos sacado el juego por estar convencidos de que pierde mucho a 2. Recientemente, con la compra de la expansión Dynasties, lo hemos rescatado con muchísima ilusión y nos sigue encantando. Sí es cierto que ambos jugadores deben estar muy atentos de no dejar el track de guerra demasiado a favor del oponente porque su ventaja será insalvable y la brecha no hará más que abrirse cada ronda. El juego es impresionante; su tensión, su sabor temático, la cantidad de posibilidades con las incontables cartas, la sensación de crecer y lo que se celebra cada punto ganado con sudor y sangre. El mejor juego de mi colección.

6/23/2015-A almost perfect euro. My game groups
favorite  game. dc


My score is 9.2.dc

12/9/2015-I believe I must go into this in more detail. the game begins with every one picking a nation now you and your game group can do one of two things.(1#choose side A and you get one extra building space)(2#choose side B and you each get a special power coruspanding with the nation you select.)the cards are then put out on the card board. Once you finish the rest of setup. You then get to do one of three actions(1#place a man on a building card)(2#undeploy a man off a building card)(3#you may buy a card).Now the most interesting of the choices(in my humble opinion)is number three you may buy one of five different cards, which I will explain in more detail. I will start with military cards. When you a military card you can place it in one of your four  spots so you can deploy one or more of your men on it. Sadly this is all I can write at this moment ,but if your interested watch rado's run through of it on board game greek or you tube. dc

If you're looking for your grand civilization experience in Nations you'll be disappointed. Even though the theme binding is rather well done it is fairly subdued. In the abstract the game is basically a pretty simple engine building game with incremental rather than exponential improvements. You'd think the streamlined rules would make for a quick game then, but for some reason it still takes quite a long time to completion. Too long, in fact, considering that the gameplay is fairly tactical in nature due to the way the cards come out.

There are a few things missing from TTA: The seeding of events, upgrading of your buildings imho more elegant resource management, less strategic more tactical. Also, military feels more restricted here: There is no distinction between different types of military units and no formations/army cards. The other players are not (battles/raids) or almost not(wars) by your war efforts; however military helps you moving up in turn order and gaining bonuses from events.

Nevertheless, Nations feels like 75% of TtA, plays in the same amount of time but is so much easier to teach and learn (learning time approx. 30 mins).

I rate it a 9 overall and I'm keen to try it again, although I'm unsure if I will ever own a copy, since TtA is one of my favourites, we know how to play it and we only play it 3 or 2 players.

A very good and interesting game with a lot of interesting decisions. The variability of the cards which could come into the game can screw you quite a bit. If f.e. you miss out to get a buildig for more corn in the first age and in the scond and third age no such building appears it can be very difficult stay competetive to the others.
I read beforehand that military is tuned down very strong. It is right in the way that if you have low military and high stability your opponents can't totally destroy you. But it is still difficult to play without military - the turn order and opportunity to conquer provinces is a great advantage.

While this does give more variety, it also makes long term strategies risky, further hindering experienced players from being able to take advantage of their knowledge of the game. Again, this is both good and bad. 

I'll keep TTA, thanks, but I can see the appeal of having a card based civ game that is easier to teach and easier to introduce to new players.

Yes! Yes! Yes! The Civ game I've been waiting for. 

+ Plays in a reasonable amount of time. (40-60 minutes per player)
+ "Tech track" in the form of Progress cards: Buildings, Military upgrades, colonies, Wonders and Advisors.
+ Solitaire-friendly. No hidden information. Has solitaire rules but can be played solo with two or more competing nations. Solo at Prince using basic cards was Meh. Solo at King difficulty with the basic and advanced. Cards was much more enjoyable (tense)
+ Not too difficult to learn but mastery takes skill and time
+ Theme is interesting but rules and theme are not completely tied together. The mechanisms and progress card effects match the theme on the card (e.g. Marie Antoinette provides lots of "culture" books but you'll have to take a significant hit on Stability). There will be ahistorical situations such as Rome building Pyramids, China taking on Montezuma as an Advisor. It's not difficult to imagine a sci-fi or fantasy re-theme.

Will likely pimp this game with wooden tokens in place of food and stone cardboard counters. Card decks will be shuffled once per game - still on the fence about sleeves.

Played 1 2-player and 2 solitaire games and can not quit thinking about it. One quick note: I've played all three games wrong as I did NOT take a second Stability when placing a second worker on a card giving stability. As a result I have struggled to get any stability going, and when I have to take a Stability hit, it has been devastating (in the solo game). But after rethinking the game I realized that the cards with Square resources do not mean that the gain is only ONCE (immediately after placing your first worker on it), but it is given immediately EACH TIME you place another worker on it. This still would not have helped much as a) I have yet to get a card that gives positive gains for Stability(!).

Overall, it is a well-constructed civvy game. Nothing new, but all its parts come together nicely. There was something that made me feel like replayability would be an issue. I would try it again, but more likely try it again with 4 players instead of the full 5 (which seemed more like an after-thought in the design). Fortunately, turns went quickly and one could puzzle the purchasing board for options when it wasn't their turn, so you didn't just have to sit there waiting for your turn to come around again. For a complex game, I enjoyed the simple structure. Punishing in places, but not too punishing. Gave me that "chase good money after bad" feeling where you don't know how much to invest in one of the advancement areas before you should just give up or throw all your chips in. That added tension throughout.

I ordered it and it arrived 6AUG2015. Nations board game box was damaged, and improperly packaged, so I sent it back to Amazon. I returned it, and Amazon sent a second one which had a good game box (I thought), but they still did not properly pack the inside of the shipping box. When I opened the Nations game to do inventory, one side of the insert was busted. I blame this on the extra big box with a lot of empty space inside it, and the heavy components laying against the insert. However upon further inspection on the external side of that Nations box, it was apparent this game had been mishandled before it ever was put in the shipping container. There was an impact area along the edge of the game box where it had either been improperly stacked, or dropped or something (but the shipping container was in perfect shape externally). I returned this second Nations game to Amazon and canceled my order completely. I received full refund 28AUG2015. The game was purchased from "Newbend Discount". So there you go, I spent a good portion of August attempting to get a good copy of the game. Maybe it just wan't meant to be. I pre-ordered "The Gallerist" from a local game store instead. Maybe Nations will get a better second printing.

Each age presents a new and enjoyable tactical puzzle. You can't make plans much beyond the current round, yet there is a wonderful sense of progression as you build up your nation and move through history. 

If I want to play a civ themed game, I'm either going to play this or "The Golden Ages" if I want something a little lighter (and with a shorter play time).

Rating based on several games at mabiweb:
The game is... strange. On one hand it is exactly like TTA - with all these cards etc. On the other - it's completely different: Nations is more streamlined, the resources are... just resources the grain and stone and other things might be something completely different, with cards not really matching the civ-theme. This much more of a economic engine building game with a civ theme on. It's not bad, actually managing all the resources is a little bit tough thing to do and needs a little bit of practice.
I like it, but I won't buy it. If I am to play a civ game I'd rather stay with Innovations (yes, this is more of a pastiche on civ game, but a GREAT one) or TTA. 
It's great to see a game I was wondering if I'd like to buy and finally see I don't need it. :D Maybe it's me staying too long in the hobby? :)

EDIT
After several more plays - this is so much of an exercise in tactics and pure spreadsheet type of thing that I'm fed up with it.

Lots of people like it, but to me the "puzzle" aspect of building your nation runs counter to the theme of the game - what you need to do and what I want to do thematically are completely different. As a result, I find it frustrating to play. Also, although it's shorter than many civ games, the incremental nature of scoring means that the leader(s) will be obvious from early on.

RATING: 7
A civilization builder that plays out in a reasonable period of time. There's no tech tree mechanism here; instead, nations are purchasing from a common pool of buildings in order to fill a limited set of slots. The constrained choices prevent the decision tree from getting too large, which keeps the game moving.

This is not a game which delivers on the feeling of building up a nation over centuries; it feels much the same in the first era as it does in the last. What it does deliver on is competition for the best buildings and best position on various upgrade tracks.

Didn't really pull me in.  An abstract civ where the engine-building aspect of the game is subtle.  The cards are mostly different flavors of the same thing.  The mechanics are on par with other civ games as is the game length.  Among the recent civ games out there, I would preliminarily put this lower than Clash of Cultures, Sid Mier's Civ, and Through the Ages (an all-time favorite of mine).  I expect I'll give it another play, and might find some layers to it --we'll see.

Solid Civ game (played with Dynasties expansion at least.)

Through the Ages is much, much better because you will see all the building/leaders etc. during a game. This game Nations  uses only a small fraction of the available cards, so there is no ability to plan-- It is all tactical based on the random cards drawn each round to be placed on the purchase board, with little long term strategy possible. You may plan to buy a good resource producing building, but none may be available for several rounds, and there are only 8 rounds in the game. Bleah.

Seems a shame for a civilization development game.

Very fun and a Brain Burner with a nice epic feel yet streamlined as others have said.  Not played TtA yet so nothing to really compare it to but definitely happy with it.  Love that so many of the cards are not seen each play and that it seems quite suitable for 2. Card luck is unforgiving and stability is overpowered.

Solid game, but it is completely tactical in nature...there is very little you can plan ahead for as you don't know which cards will come out (both in the card rows and in the event deck). There is a high likelihood that you will need to account for a shortage of one resource or another.

My second play did start me thinking that while I enjoy it, I'm not absolutely sure how much choice there is in the game...it seems rather obvious most turns what I need to do...at least provided there are cards out there that provide what I'm looking for...it also seems that architects are in shorter supply than I might prefer...and thematically I don't get why other nations affect the building of your wonders.

Very fond of this game thus far, I have been playing a ton solo.  Solo game is solid out of the box and if it weren't so expensive I would say it is worth it even to buy it for solo play.

Overall, I think it is the non-conflictual, euro civ champ.  So that means it is second billing to Clash of Cultures, which is best in show for Civ games.  Military is executed perfectly (for what it wants to do; important but not nasty), and the progress feels good, but not great.  I wouldn't call this "epic" because most of the progress is is simply getting bigger numbers for your buildings.  Still, the game manages to induce tension by making sure you'll always be weak in at least one resource.

Definitely improves on Through the Ages as it's less fiddly and you don't have the whack-the-loser problem that was so odious.

I like how the cards come out randomly, which really reduces the analysis and solvability of the game, which can kill a lot of deeper games. But, the cards come out randomly, so the civilization theme is pretty thin, there's no story to the game. I was Buddha conquering England with my conquistadors, until Martin Luther took over and developed voortrekkers. So it's a bit silly. 

Still, it was fun and not offensive like Through the Ages, but don't expect any coherency.

The one aspect of TTA  I miss most is the players' influence on the event deck, which is a brilliant mechanism.  But I quibble. Nations does pretty much everything superbly well.

Euro con tematica historica en el que el objetivo es conseguir la mayor puntuacion posible, la cual se obtiene con varios logros incluyendo cultura, politica y guerra. 

El juego parte de unas buenas premisas pero en mi opinion no consigue traducirlas en un desarrollo ameno. en mi opinion el mayor defecto del juego es su escaso enganche tematico. otros tambien aducen que hay poca interaccion entre jugadores, lo cual para mi no es un gran defecto pero si es cierto que las posibles acciones para atacar rivales son muy limitadas. 

otro defecto tambien en mi opinion son los componentes y la presentacion. no es un juego que entre por los ojos, ni mucho menos.

Indeed quite similar to Through the Ages. It has some interesting stuff, but the straw that breaks the camel's back for me on this one is its theme integration--I feel like this is even less of a civ game than TtA, which admittedly did not come out very well in the theme department.
So we're left with a pretty procedural Euro; a good one, to be sure, and one that flows pretty smoothly, but not really on a par with its forebear. Strangely, it feels more like Prosperity than anything else.

A less fiddly version of "Through the Ages" with a much better war-mechanism sounds great and while the game isn't a bad one, it didn't catch me.

There is a good amount of luck involved and if you have a bad start, you are pretty much fucked. It takes way too long for my taste, too.

I don't know why, but I like setting up my actions and resources in "Through the Ages" more, even though I think that Nations does a much better job overall. Nations feels very boring to me.

Also, I would call Nations the harder and for sure less forgiving game. Ah well, both are ok, but both take too long for my taste.

Eurogame amb tema de civilitzacions (molt enganxat, en poca estona deixes de veure el tema i només et fixes en quins recursos dona cada carta), no té cap similitud amb el TtA. És un joc de gestió de recursos amb una oferta de cartes.

Té menys "llibertat" i la sensació de creixement és molt menys acusada. Més tàctic que estratégic, pots canviar moltíssim durant el torn. Molta menys interacció que en el TtA.

I was pleasantly surprised by Nations, having already played Through the Ages. What I can say right off the bat is that the often made comment that TtA leans further towards strategy and Nations more towards tactics was wholly my experience. However, since they are cut from very similar cloth, I can make my comments comparative.

Things I liked in comparison: 
- 1. The way in which actions are singular and alternating means that you don't have to wait for someone to grind their way through their turn (and it makes it easier for you to not do so either!).
- 2. The cards not all coming out means that players have to adapt a whole lot more. There's no meta-game involved in waiting out Napoleon here.
- 3. Events add a bit of meta-spice to the mix, making players have to adapt a bit more.
- 4. Variable and asymmetrical starting powers are an option.
- 5. End game scoring couldn't be any easier.

Things I disliked in comparison:
- 1. Wars, what happened to them? First of all, the only type of aggression available are wars and their effects can also be heavily mitigated through the influence track. This potentially means that the game becomes primarily one of drafting cards and optimizing one's position. I understand that aggression is the most difficult thing to balance out within a civilization game -- to brutal and it feels almost pointless to build things up in the first place, too soft and you're barely encouraged to build up a military.

While I still prefer Through the Ages to Nations, I think it is a good design in its own right, even if the inter-player interaction has been nerfed considerably.

RATING: 9
Currently our favorite!! Just looking at the little cards with all the wonders, inventions or even wars makes me feel happy! Wish they have come out with an appendix to briefly introduce these events, like in Twilight Struggle. Although some bits have not felt that convincing or clear, like the stability and military gain.

[Initial impression: 5]
A civilization-building game where you have to manage military, stability, and resources to access buildings, wonders, advisors, and colonies. Has a few different strategies, but also encourages flexibility in response to events of each age. Less interesting than other civilation-builders; would have liked player interaction to be more than just through the wars and one-up-manship on the book track.

6 may be due mostly to novelty -- based on one play.
Military appears to be overvalued compared to other strategies and there's too much randomness in which cards appear for a game of this length.

Civilization building as a theme isn't probably my favorite (I've never been much into Sid Meier's Civilization or other games similar to that) but because of Through the Ages and its great reviews I've decided to give it and some other similar games a chance to impress me. I haven't played this yet, but I will, probably soon.

Played this 5 times, sold it after the last play. I kept hoping it would be good, but nothing came of it. I got tired of the rich-get-richer, military being so important (go first, get colonies, get battles, hammer others with wars, etc), if you get behind you've had it, experience. Terrible. I was really hoping for something better.

I got so pissed off with it that I sold it after the 5th play. I seriously thought about giving it away, but someone offered me £20 for it. I hardly ever sell games but this one I was glad to see the back of.

This game is rather tough actually. You try to build your empire thoroughly and methodically, but it constantly seems to be balancing on the verge of catastrophy. Fortunately, it is not a bad thing for a game to generate the feeling that you never have enough stuff and stability and constantly want more of everything. And there are so many different ways to build and expand your civilization here, sometimes according to plan, but also in a very improvised way. Maybe that is why I like this game so much: you have to find the delicate equilibrium between strategy and opportunism. The solo play is also one of the best I have ever tried.

-The events are random and do not affect every players equally depending of their strategies.
-Very difficult to avoid military as you'd suffer wars and can't take colonies/battle cards.
-You often know who is going to win 1 or 2 rounds before the end.
-Growing your population is seldom a good move unless playing at the higher difficulties.
-Very expensive.

Nations is a game that, for me, is about the journey more than the end result scoring. In fact, I think the end scoring is the weak point of the game. The strong point? The constant struggle round to round to make sure you can handle the various wars, events, and famine, while still trying to grab cards that will help you going forward. This game is a ton of fun.

One note: The solo game is EXCELLENT. There are different components in the game for solo, which is really nice compared to the usual "pasted on rules for solo" that is the norm. A lot of fun solo as well as being a lot of fun multiplayer!

(03/14/2014) Comment based on one play.

This is a great game. I enjoyed my first play so much that I bought it from the owner at a board game meetup!

Within a few turns, I could easily see this is a far more accessible, streamlined, and intuitive game than Through the Ages. I've only played the short game of TTA once, and that was enough. Nations plays smoothly and quickly, while TTA was like sifting through a spreadsheet. At least, it is for me--this is a far superior game; I didn't realize how quickly it had risen through the BGG ranks. I was prepared to be frustrated and bored, because of the similar card drafting mechanism, but the three rows of cards provides plenty of visibility and flexibility, rather than a single row like in TTA. It only took about 15 minutes to explain, which is much shorter than most civ games I've played in the past. 

Cards represent buildings, monuments, bonuses (golden age), advisors (famous historical figures), raids, colonies, wars, and military. They can be bought from one of three rows, costing 1/2/3 coins, where unbought cards from the top expensive row (3 coins) drops down to 1 coin, similar to St. Petersburg. Workers are placed on the building cards to "build and man" the building(s) by spending stone. The building can immediately boost up stability, or increase coin/food/stone/book production. Monuments require architects, which are in limited supply, to complete by spending stone also. Placing a worker on a military card temporarily boosts the military rating of the civilization, but is expensive and has either a one-time cost, or a sustaining cost in terms of food/stability/books. If a military rating is high enough, it is possible to acquire colonies, which usually give you sustained production of a type of resource. Wars can be declared by buying such a card, and then setting the max military level that must be achieved, which is similar in feel to 7 Wonders, or a penalty must be paid. If there is at least one worker on military, it is possible to pick up raid cards, which result in one of the food/stone/book resources. Advisors can give sustaining income of food/stone/book, as well.

In general, coins are needed to buy cards, stone is needed to man the buildings and to get resource production, food is required to feed extra workers, as well as pay a random amount due to famine on the event card, which is different for every one of the 8 turns. Books represents knowledge, and having more is helpful in scoring VP in one of four book scoring rounds. Stability is sort of the opposite of "misery" in Age of Renaissance, and reduces the impact of losing a war. It is fascinating to watch a military build-up, in response to a war card, only to watch disarmament the next round, depending on the game state, as well as the player's objectives.

Yes, the tracks of stability, military, and books seems similar to the various tracks in TTA. Other than that, it feels more like a game of London, with players upgrading their "stacks" of buildings (although you are limited in the number of stacks, and you actually get rid of the older building). Similar to Twilight Imperium 3rd Edition and Eclipse, you can take as many actions as you wish during a particular turn (of eight), provided you have enough resources to do what you want. There are no geographical maps, but there is a player tableau where players can customize their own respective layout.

Although the theme is a bit more abstract, one gets the sense of moving through time and history, at a fairly rapid clip. Starting from ancient times, the game reaches the industrial revolution within eight turns. There is plenty to explore here, as well as enjoy. Components are very good, with sufficient rules. Play is relative quick, with little downtime, and many meaningful decisions each turn. A player can take as many actions as they wish per turn, subject to the limits of resources, so this is not a fixed number of turns type of game. Further, the complexity of the game can be adjusted by taking out or inserting specific cards, and the complexity can be individually adjusted through the amount of resources one gets at the beginning of each turn. Thus, a stronger veteran player can effectively give a handicap to a new player or comparatively weaker player. Initial rating is "9", with room to move up very quickly. This could be the best abstract civ-lite game out there that plays within 2 to 2.5 hours.

(04/06/2014) 4 plays: What is so enjoyable about Nations is watching civilizations build up military, when the event card and/or war provoke it, or seeing a juicy colony. The militaries can then disarm the next turn, so that the workers can be reassigned to "peacetime" activities. The same goes for building up stability, since the event cards and/or war can provoke an increase. As the game progresses through the four ages, the buildings and military types upgrade, giving more production/strength/VP, but at greater cost.

However, the game has a dark side, with a serious case of "runaway loser", where if one is unable to keep up with the punitive events, the game will mercilessly continue to punish the player for the rest of the game; it is literally impossible to catchup--the leaders will continue to steamroll forward in all aspects. Also, Rome's "B" side may be too powerful, since with a Legionnaire and +2 built-in military, with one worker placement, it has first-grab of any Era I colony(s) that pop up; it is then easy to roll over Persia, even though it has 3x colony slots.

(05/18/2014) 16 plays. This is the hottest game in our group. Everyone wants to play it, although there are some mumblings about it starting to feel same-y. The game is starting to scream for more nation tableaus--five is not enough variety. After playing at the Emperor level, all are convinced of the awesome tension that this game delivers. We also played a 5-player for the first time, and this was also a phenomenal experience. With one newbie, the 5P game took about 2 hours 45 minutes, which is much, much less than a comparable game of Through the Ages with four players! The fact that difficulty can be tailored through the handicap, the asymmetrical boards, three progress decks, and three tiers of event cards, this game has a lot of re-playability. The fact that everyone wants to play it again, after two hours, and the fact that we can squeeze two games of this on a game night, speaks volumes to the sheer brilliance of this design. It hits all the right buttons and scratches the civilization itch like no other. I'm upping this to a solid "10".

I have wondered about why a map-less civilization game could be so successful (ranking at #49, as of 5/2014), when compared to [thing=40765][/thing] (ranking at #142)? It seems that Nations is able to effectively convey the feeling of nation building and evolution through time, although many aspects of nation building are highly abstracted. War, for example, is a simple comparison of military strength indexes. There are no spatial elements to worry about; that is, no fronts, flanks, or logistics. CoC is brilliant in that it drills down to the unit level, all which can be moved around on a hex grid board, replete with terrain. CoC also has a superb exploration mechanism that Nation lacks. While CoC is wonderful in that it simulates the growth of individual nation-states, with its five-piece cities, it is essentially stuck in the Antiquity/Classical era, in the time of Homer. Nations speeds through four Ages in a matter of two hours, giving players just enough of a taste of each period, before moving on to the next age. It emphasizes the march of technology, where nations had better be constantly modernizing, or be quickly cast aside into the dust bin of history. It is this sense of urgency, the need to upgrade, to grab that critical progress card, or to trigger an war event, all before someone else does, that gives Nations the wonderful tension and nail-biting decisions. This is further exemplified by the seemingly quick rounds, where players fire off action-by-action, causing a constant ebb and flow of action and reaction. So, you don't really need a map to vividly convey the rise of a civilization. You only need some abstract representations to guide you along. In that, Nation succeeds in spades. The fact that it plays in about two hours is just about the threshold for most gamers I know--it is long enough to develop a story and feel somewhat "epic", but short enough that you don't have to suffer through the occasional bad game. It certainly leaves the feeling of "what if" making the players wanting to play it more in order to experiment. CoC is still a wonderful game, and is spatially very interesting, but it is also correspondingly more sophisticated. By comparison, Nations is not as sophisticated, but it is still very interesting, because it is highly interactive from the beginning. Every action can affect all the other players, and the events will motivate or discourage all players equally; how they respond to (and profit from or mitigate) each event tends to sift the winners from the losers. CoC is more akin to classic wargaming, where there are fronts and flanks and other spatial considerations, and thus is less interactive--you may be focusing all your energy on only one opponent, if there two or three. This is neither good or bad, but simply shows the varied interests and motivations of today's board gaming audience.

Der Versuch eine Partie Through the Ages auf unter 4h zu stutzen. Das Spiel ist OK, jedoch wenig thematisch und grafisch einfach nicht schön. Noch dazu zielt ein Großteil des Spiels verstärkt darauf einfach Marker auf Leisten vorzuziehen. Und warum muss ich meine sämtlichen Bauwerke überbauen? Dadurch habe ich am Ende des Spiels nicht das Gefühl meine Nation ausgebaut zu haben, mein Spielertableau sieht auf den ersten Blick noch genau so aus wie zu Spielbeginn. Trotz grenzwertiger Spielzeit ist Through the Ages auf jeden Fall die bessere Wahl.

A streamlined version of Through the Ages that plays well across a variety of player counts and has a war mechanism that doesn't involve the weakest player being constantly picked on. You always seem to be perpetually short of all the in-game currencies (money, food and minerals) and the early turns feel like a struggle against bankruptcy. Only a small proportion of the ample card decks will come out each game, so it doesn't pay to go too far into one strategy (there's no point in going heavily into military with no battles or wars to fight, for instance), it's better to stay flexible and do a bit of everything. This can make the game feel a little bland, I'm not sure there are really competing strategies, but would definitely play again.

Only played once, 2 players.

The 2 player game is super dumb.  Because the main scoring mechanism is based on how *many* players you're beating, the game ends up being a silly squabble over books with very few tradeoffs.

A civ-feel game with high accessibility. Nations is less satisfied experience as a Civ game, but arguably much better as a game than [thing=25613]TTA[/thing], at least it can hit table much more frequently. 

In nations, it has no way to create a powerful and prosperous country and absolutely crash an opponent :>. The military aspect in nations is just toy-gun level.

Also, only small portion of cards used in each game. Thus the connection between cards is much more random and luck based(comparing to TTA, still). 

The retail price is a meh...

Excellent civilization building game. I've played it at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 players. The solo game is honestly not that great, but it works marvelously at the other player counts (beware that a 5-player game is lengthy. On the order of 3 to 4 hours). Haven't played a boring one yet. It has balanced A/B sides for each player board, interesting mechanics for growth, war and player interaction, and excellent production values (with the exception of the default box insert; I've seen worse, but it's not exactly great).

It manages the trick of being a substantial, thinky game that's fairly easy to teach.

A pleasantly crunchy thinking game where you develop your nation from antiquity to modern era (although this is more abstracted through the purchase of cards).  It is fairly long playing, around 2-3 hours, but is structured to avoid most down time.  Player on player aggression is limited to war cards where you try to run the military track to impose penalties on army weak players (almost always Egypt).  Strategic play/purchase of cards makes it fun, offers a solo play option.  This is the exact type of game I truly enjoy (Civilization without the trading and military eye-gouging).

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

If only I could create my ideal world of prosperity and wealth; but just like in real life, you have to work with what you've got in this very puzzle-like civilization builder. 

Making a square plug fit in a round hole is what the game felt like on the first few attempts, often ending with massive deficits or just never ever seeing a kind of card I was really banking on, over several turns. But just like most card-driven games, you really are just making all the available pieces fit, your ideal world be damned. Once I let go of this desire to build a full set of wonders, or manage a full loop on the culture track, my enjoyment of the game sky-rocketed. And while it certainly sounds sad to give up on your dreams, there is certainly a lot of fun to be had in the production phase and in the tactile nature of building your civilization. 

[b]Solitaire Review:[/b]

This game is the main culprit for me getting more and more into solitaire board gaming. There is almost no more management required than that in the main game, and all the fun is still completely intact. Even as I write this, I'm thinking of what kind of civilization I could build with what fate the cards present me, and whether I can beat my last high score. 

[i]F.Y.I.[/i] My enjoyment of the game greatly increased after removing all of the advanced cards from the game. While I usually revel in more complex games, here it just adds more randomness to the card draws and more often than not results in a wall of military and war when you just want to see a little of something else. 

[b]Pros:[/b] 

- A great, relatively quick civilization builder, that does feel very epic in scale. 
- The game-play is very stream-lined. Leaving workers on the cards between turns speeds things up considerably. 
- Military doesn't directly hurt or destroy another player's civilization, only hinders point scoring most of the time. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- the cards that are available can be very frustrating sometimes, especially when there is a wall of military and you're completely focused on production. 
- Loosing on both Military and Stability tracks at once will be extremely frustrating, until you figure out the game-play and realize it's not usually that important, unless the events that turn are brutal.

Joué à 5 je pense, comme vu dans les commentaires à 5 c'est trop j'ai mal débuté mon jeu et quand tu arrives dernier tu n'as pas trop la chance de monté.    Il n'y a pas assez de bonne carte dans le tableau pour supporter le jeu à 5 je pense.  

J'ai joué a 7 wonders et la guerre était moins importante pour gagner comparé au niveau de Nations.  Le système de guerre je le trouve un peu trop indirect une personne peu partir la guerre à tous les tours à tous le monde à un moment donné j'ai trouvé le move  "chicken" je ne vois pas la proximité dans le fait de faire la guerre on fait la guerre global par une personne c'est comme un bashing reversé.  La "punition" est en random.  

Pour les autres jeux où il a une punition random appliquée à ceux qui n'ont pas la bonne valeur voulu je pense que ce jeux t'en écoeure. 

Les livres c'est tu si important que ça?  je ne pense pas trop s'il y a la guerre à tous les tours 

La prochaine fois je vais ajuster mieux mes flutes mais ce ne serai pas un achat.

Interesting. Warrants more investigation. More variation than TTA but much more fiddly in set-up.

Takes a bit more time in set-up than I'd like and has a longer playtime than TTA. Variety is nice though, so I guess it's up to individuals to decide which they like best.

Juegaco de civilizaciones.

Te recordará un poco al TTA ya que la mecánica principal es seleccionar cartas de un track pagando monedas, uno de los tres recursos del juego. 

En esas cartas encontraremos líderes, solo podemos tener uno activo, edificios que generarán recursos si desplegamos en ellos kekos, unidades militares en las que nuevamente desplegaremos kekos, maravillas que construiremos, colonias que conquistaremos y alguna cartica más.

La fuerza militar será importante pero no tan agresiva como en otros juegos de civilizaciones. Marcará el orden de turno y nos permitirá hacer frente a las guerras.

Además hay alguna cosica más, como un track de estabilidad, que te permitirá reducir determinado efectos negativos, al principio del turno tomarás la decisión de crecer (más kekos) o tomar recursos, al final del turno hay un evento etc ...

Si se conoce el juego se juega en un plis y deja unas sensaciones muy buenas.

Nota: he jugado con la expansión Dinastías y me ha gustado. Amén de las cartas nuevas, el concepto de las cartas de dinastía y las maravillas naturales me parece que amplían el juego sin romper nada de su base. Un acierto

Great game.  Just as I expected.

Well-oiled, precise mechanism.  But be careful how you handle it ;)
Optimization is all over the place.  If you like it, you should love the game.

It's too long and way too uncontrollable with 5 players, but otherwise it's very good.

A bit lighter and less complex than TtA.

EDIT: BRILLIANT replayability.

Messy, chaotic, and punishing. Nations falls apart as a multiplayer game but truly shines 2 player. Ties benefit no one leading to a zero sum game of constantly one upping your opponent or making sacrifices to punish them in areas they're weakest.

RATING: 7.5
First off I have not played TTA so can't compare to that, other than to say I doubt highly this is as long as that full game or even close, 3 newbies played this in 3 hours and we weren't rushing which I understand is not really possible with TTA (for at least 10 or more games, even then I think full game 3 people is more like 4-6). Also this game was VERY easy to learn overall, and I understand TTA is not

Its a classic engine game with a Civ theme, I don't find the theme very strong at all, nothing compared to Pax Porfiriana for sure which has a great strong theme. Speaking of which, both games have a large market of cards to buy from as the central mechanic, along with building your tableau. One of the big differences (there are many small ones) is in the interaction between these two. Here it is in the market competition, and then there is an abstracted war effect maybe once a round where you can be affected, where as in Pax attacking other peoples cards directly is one of the key factors so that is much more interactive (even too much for some surely). 

So the best part of this game imo is the strategic nature, kind of like a deck builder you have great flexibility in how you will build your tableau/Civ, and multiple approaches/paths should work I'm sure and there are a good few ways to score. Basically all the game is here is deciding which cards to buy and when to fit your overall strategy for the game. Now IIRC I think there is a pretty large deck of cards feeding the market, so I don't think you will know just which cards are coming down the pike so you can't plan everything just so. 

The worst part of the game for me was the dumb random event that happened every turn, it just has no place in an otherwise lower luck strategic game. The variable famine amount is not so bad, it is when one player gets arbitrarily shafted that it gets stupid. Its not game breaking, if you are somewhat balanced it shouldn't hamper you too much but it sure doesn't sit well with me.

Anyway its an expensive game for what it is imho, and maybe still a little long so not something I need to rush out and buy but I enjoyed it and would happily play. I'm sure TTA has its pros & cons comparatively, I'm thinking the pros of Nations are worth the Cons it has in comparison but I need to play TTA to know for sure

This game belongs in the top ten.

Tight design, right play time for the amount of depth, theme "feels" right, once you learn the iconography and turn structure, everything flows well.  Constant, meaningful decisions without induced AP.  These are hallmarks of the "8"s in my collection.

But wait - there's more: in game ability scaling that works quite well with minimal impact, three times as many cards as you would need for a four-player game, in varying configurations of difficulty for all players.  So not only can you handicap yourself relative to other players, you can collectively decide whether you want a tighter, Agricola-esque experience, or a lighter, more Belfort-y experience, where there's light screwage, but everyone basically has the resources to do as they wish.  And the "B" sides of each player board give you the option to remove the structural symmetry and introduce another layer of strategy, if you wish.

Yes, two-player is tense and brutal.  So is Twilight Struggle.  Yes, you can fall behind in the first 30 minutes and not have a great catchup route.  That's true in most systems without luck (be it dice or frequent card draws).

Play this.

I'm always up for a good civilization-building game, but Nations is way too long and unbalanced for what it is. So much of one's destiny is wrapped up in the order the cards come into play. And unlike Euro games where one can just pursue different paths to victory once one has been denied, certain paths in the game (namely military) seem much stronger than other routes to winning.

As much as I'd like to try this one again, I don't feel like investing the two to three hours needed to run through it once more.

I love the concept and idea behind this game but it absolutely fails as a competitive two player game.  I've heard it is good with 4-5 and I don't doubt that at all, but the asymmetrical nations (B Sides) are not balanced with two players.  Less available culture based victory points = some nations have a major edge in end game scoring.  First player is too important and often whomever picks cards first gets the no brainer pick which just makes the rich richer and the other player falls into a death spiral.  The game states that it is designed for 1-5 players so my rating of 2 based on the two player game is justified.  

As a single player game, however, it is not half bad.  I'd give the game a rating of 7 for this player count. 

Will revisit the rating if I ever manage to get a group of 4-5 players together to try this out.

Excellent game that might not have quite enough variety to keep it going forever. I haven't play with any of the advanced cards, so I'm not sure if I can make that call yet. The rules are simple, but you have plenty of things that you have to plan for. Looking forward to getting some more plays in.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2014)

Many friends prefer Nations over Through the Ages (currently my 2nd favorite game of all time), so I was keen on trying Nations but it was hard to getting it to the table. Last Saturday I was able to play it and I found the game to be a letdown, perhaps because I was excepting a GREAT game. Nations is HUGELY TtA derivative, I knew that both games were somewhat similar but they are VERY similar. I can’t help but comparing both games.

I don’t mind long games, what I really hate is the downtime and Nations has downtime in spades. I think it has to be played with 3 players, with more I begin to get bored. I also dislike that I have to begin again when I replace a building or army outfit. This doesn’t have any thematic sense. In Nations it is very hard to get the one resource you are missing because you only have a limited space for buildings on your board. This doesn’t have any thematic sense either. Creating new people in Nations is hugely expensive, their maintenance is always higher that you can repay (in the early stages that gives you a +2 at most of resources) so you are always going to be in the negative. This doesn’t have any sense to me and I don’t like it. A hard game is generally a positive thing for me and I will have to play again to see if this is the case with Nations or not.

Military power is very important, many friends said that military wasn’t as important as it is on TtA but it is. I know maintaining a strong military force takes a lot of resources, but the negatives of losing a war can be devastating. In TtA when you lose a war you can end losing up the game right there so wars are a lot more forgiving in Nations, but still very important. The bad news is that the turn order is also decided by the military power allowing for runaway leaders and the weaker get weaker situations. The strong always get first chance to get the better cards. 

Oversized box, I was expecting better components due to its price and box size, the art and components are merely ok. 

For now I will play Nations again to see if I like it better. On its own it is a good game but it doesn´t come close to TtA greatness.

There has been some opportunities to play Nations over the last months, but I have always resisted them. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating to one that matches my current feelings for the game with the BGG recommended rating system.

For me, Nations is average at best and my desire to play it again is very low. I was expecting a much better game.

We are loving this game!  The more we play it, the better it gets.  Most of our plays are with 2.  Right now we are still playing on Cheiftan level and on the "B" side of the player boards.  Each board, each country is its own puzzle.  The variety in the cards is great since you don't get through the deck in a game, and you never know what will come out in each round.  The puzzle is making do with what you have.  Just can't get enough of this game!

Also own the Dynasties expansion.  It is a must-have for us because it adds so much variety to the game.

Un juego de civilizaciones basado en draff de cartas y colocación de trabajadores; Es muy exigente en cada ronda debes luchar contra el resto de jugadores y contra el propio juego en forma de eventos, lo que hace que sea un juego muy táctico, variando entre rondas en las que vas fatal y otras en las que despuntas. La gran variedad de cartas y que solo salgan 1/4 por partida, hacen que tenga una enorme rejugabilidad.

RATING: 9
I had my fair share of doubts when coming into trying this game out as I was already had my standards set so high by being avid fan of Sid Mieier's Civilization video games.

Of course, it wouldn't be much fair to compare video game to board game, but with this specific Civ building games, much focus and feel of the game is the accomplishment of how your civilization came about, and flourished or perished all while having tied into historical backgrounds. 

Does Nations satisfied me? Yes, it did but I still need to play a bit more. Not a complex game, but the strategy is heavy, and few more plays will sort out unease feelings that I have about this game.

+ Nice little touch on back of cards that progressively gain colors as ages pass. Little things like this makes me happy :).

+ Simple rules. The game is so simple to teach yet the strategy behind this game is immerse. 

+ The strategy in this game is huge. More I play this game, I discover so much more paths to victory. My first few were like ok...I really don't know what I am doing. But after seen some cards, how the interactions better work out, and grasp the flow of the game better, it opened up totally new stage. It was like Mage Knight experience all over again except Nations is much easier game.

+/- It is not very strategical, but rather you will have to deal with what is best given to you at the moment. You cannot go into this game thinking that I will build a massive army and stomp over others - rather you will need to be flexible to be able to adept to any changes. Much akin to RftG in that regard. This can be pro and con, but for me I don't mind it too much as I like tactical games. This does not mean that overall strategy is not absolutely viable - just prepare to change. 

+ Perhaps it is that likeness to RftG which draws me so much into this game. For solo, it plays fairly quickly (~30 mins), has Civ building theme (although you don't really feel acomplished looking at 4 buildings and few wonders in the end), and packed with meaningful choices on each round as what is the best course of action to take.

- The components feel very cheap. The box is unnecessarily big but I am not sure whether this was to accommodate for more expansions coming. Cardboard bits are just barely serviceable. If the components were any less in quality, I would have cried foul. I have Caverna and MK besides Nations which I paid even less than Nations: needless to say, I was unimpressed. As a paying customer, I demand more for my hard earned money.

- Only Industrial age? I know that they cut it down for playing time issues but I wanted to see modern day achievements and scientific development cards. It would have been awesome to see Lunar Exploration or Mars colonies wonder. Or a wonder that is so hard to build and takes much resources but allows you to have scientific victory. Next expansions perhaps? But I have no idea how they are going to pull it off without increasing the playing time.

A very good solo game.  Looking forward to playing this multiplayer.  This is empire building at a more infastructure level which requires balancing of your people to give your empire what it needs in order to progress.  I like the way that military plays out with a countries stability mitigating any loses that would have been incurred.

Only gripe would be you can suffer from luck of the draw on occassion which can stunt a nations progress especial when you are waiting for a paricular resource producer.  The rule book can also be a slight annoyance with some text on certain wonder and advisor cards not being clear on what effect it has on the game.

Having only played TtA online, I feel this is a superior game.  I enjoy the fact that every game is truly random and that some cards just won't come out vs you know every card is going to come out, just a question of when.

I also prefer military in this game as it is non directed and can be avoided vs TtA where military is very penal and almost to the point of once behind, you are always behind.  TtA is very much a punch the weakie, and then keep kicking him while he is down.

The handicapping system also works great and is easily implemented.

I'm not fond of how few turns you have to utilize the card rows for each age.

Considering selling this, as I would rather play Through the Ages.

- can't depend on certain types of cards coming out at all without modified setup

altogether, the design sacrifices some depth and strategic potential for streamlining purposes

RATING: 8
Moving card display, resource acquisition and payment, population usage and management, buildings, wonders, colonies, all of these facets can equally apply to Nations and Through the Ages. I would venture to say Nations wouldn't exist without Vlaada's ground-breaking work on TtA. While it is clearly derivative, Nations offers a completely different play experience than TtA.

Nations simplifies the game by reducing the dependencies and interactions between cards and removing or streamlining all of the penalties for high production and population growth. Also, there is no concept of "government" in Nations and government might be THE defining feature of any empire. As a result, Nations lacks the feeling of political struggle and incremental growth that TtA captures really well. In Nations, much of this boils down to "what do I need more or less of next turn? let me adjust". That's not the say the game isn't fun or interesting, it's just different. Nations is about acquiring cards that you need and then populating and using them to manage your growth effectively. Nations feels more like an optimization exercise of upgrading cards and shifting resources. In what it does do, it is one of the better mid-weight euros I've played this year. 

Happy to own this and enjoy it when I want a mid-weight euro. While similar in many ways to TtA, they aren't even trying to do the same thing.

Not much lighter than Through the Ages, but certainly a lot shorter, which I guess makes it better.  Less of a spreadsheet feel, but also no interesting combos.  The scoring system here (which is the one thing TTA gets right) is a bit of a let down.  AP very possible.  No epic sense of civilization building.  At 75 minutes for 2 players Nations is enjoyable, but that really decreases if it drags on.

I think I went through the 5 stages of loss and grief when playing this game multiple times. At first it was denial as I decided that I didn't want to invest in military and thought that it would be a good idea. When that plan didn't work I was then naturally quite angry. I tried to bargain with the game by saying that it was just the way the cards came out. Depression soon followed as I figured out it was not the game I hoped it would be. Luckily acceptance was next because it is a nice game in it's own right. 

Seriously though, I like this game quite a bit. The first play left me cold and bitter as I thought that there was no viable strategy without military in this game. I mean like 2/3 of the cards are dedicated to military. The second time I tried it, I won using no military whatsoever. So I was glad to see that the game was balanced enough to include pacifists like myself. 

Still, I can see the complaints regarding the dynamic nature of the card draws. There are so many cards in each deck that you can quite easily have a miserable game since the cards just come out wrong. 

One of my buddies mentioned the similarities to 7 Wonders and I can definitely see what he's saying. I think I need to give this one another play or two just to see how much I like it. 

It is definitely worth a play though!

Nations promises to be what I wished Through the Ages was. Micro-managing your empire in TTA was highly enjoyable on your turn. It dragged on other players' turns. It was killed for me when the wars in the third age came up and it became obvious that there's no alternative strategy to developing military might.
Nations seems to solve these issues. It's streamlined, each player only takes small turns avoiding ten-minute breaks between your turns and the fiddliness of TTA is gone. It's possible to pursue non-military strategies by either declaring a minor war yourself to preempt players with strong military from waging war or by upgrading the stability of your civilization to weather any upcoming war.
As a whole, TTA is better designed and deeper but Nations is more for me although there are more rough edges. It's too early to tell if there are other more severe weaknesses, dominant strategies or strategic musts. Until then, I remain optimistic on Nations.

Played only the non-advanced game but really liked the experience. After a lot of TTA plays it felt frustrating how much less of an impact military has here, but that (and some other handicapping mechanisms built into the game) make Nations much more suitable to play with noobs than TTA which is much less forgiving to noobs. Even if this is never more than a pleasant alternative to TTA in the mapless civ game genre, it is good enough to make it to the table.

It is very clearly TtA with the serial numbers filed off, and much of the streamlining done has some merit (e.g. teaching Nations probably takes 20% of the time of doing it for TtA). But fundamentally what was gained in shorter playtime was lost in compelling gameplay.

Never ever play with all the cards mixed together. The card decks are way too large compared to the number of cards seen, which makes streaky and abnormal card draws way too likely. The game is somewhat better with just the basic deck or the competitive game variant, since the card distribution will be more sensible. However, this still won't help too much with the event card distribution. And no matter what, the gameplay is very tactical. 

A special demerit for making the base game box contain huge amounts of components that apparently nobody should play with. Usually you'd at least wait for an expansion before destroying a game like that.

RATING: 9
Deuxième partie pour moi. Ça me confirme que je l'aime bien. Le premier 3/4 de la partie je me concentre à seulement ne pas me planter. J'avais les égyptiens qui n'ont aucun militaire, il y a eu très peu de cartes militaires dans le premier âge et elles ont toutes été prises avant que je puisse avoir la chance (j'avais 10 or pour acheter n'importe quoi, mais comme j'étais le plus faible militaire les cartes ne se rendaient jamais à moi). Heureusement, j'ai survécu aux guerres pendant au moins 3 tours sans aucune possibilité de militaire. Au 4e âge je me fais une mega-machine de production (31 roches à l'avant dernier-tour) et je construit des tonnes de bonhommes à 2 points. Par contre je n'ai fait AUCUN point avec les "livres" de toute la partie, alors ce n'est pas assez pour compenser mes points.

Je suis un grand amateur de Through the ages, Nations n'est définitivement pas pareil mais on ne peut s'empêcher de comparer. Il ne remplace pas la tension de la possibilité de guerres ravageuses à TTA, mais il est intéressant en étant plus accessible pour des nouveaux, plus rapide et plus constant (on joue toujours, comparé aux pauses de TTA). Je suis impressionné de la simplicité des règles et du livre de règles pour un jeu avec une telle profondeur, j'avais l'impression qu'il manquait la moitié du manuel, mais non tout est là et clair. 8/10, possiblement vers un 9/10 (04-2014)

I've only just started reading the rule book, and already find the rules "Base, advanced and expert cards" totally wrong. For example, my Philipines and Armenia Progress cards, which the rules say are advanced and expert, respectively, have no set symbols in the top right corner of the pictures, as the rules say. So I look under Forum/Rules on the Nations page here on BGG, and I see there are fifteen pages of rules questions! I admit I'm getting older and my comprehension is not what it was, but fifteen pages of rules questions? This game ain't for me. I think I'll go back to chess...

RATING: 10
A relatively quickly playing civ game with enough interaction and no direct conflict. That's definitely a game for me. There are also some nice touches that remind of Sid Meier's computer games which splendidly add to the atmosphere. Overall, this is about drafting the best civ stuff from a public board and really tight resource management that eases up a bit towards the end as your engine rolls smoother. I really like the handling of military and wars and the balance within those as it's perfectly possible to run a successful pacifist strategy. And that's really a must have option for a civ game, because otherwise it's a war game. The stability is also a super neat mechanism. Different plays of Nations offer a huge amount of variability and there's a lot, lot, lot of replayability.

Top 5 game.  Just a superb design. 
Playtime is more around 1 hour per player; 40min/player as sugggested on game box is very optimistic.     
This game satisfies me the same way Agricola dose.  It has excellent competition for actions, meaningful choices, limited resources, tremendous replayability.  It also has decent play time compared to other larger civ games, and is designed with difficulty modifications to balance experience levels.  This is something sorely lacking in Through the Ages.

RATING: 6
This civilization game aims to take most of the elements from Through the Ages (notably excluding government) and put them in a similar but gentler and more manageable mould. Some parts feel smoother, there are fewer miniature bits, it scales more handily, warfare is not explicitly targeted, strategic commitment is limited, thematic matching is all over the place. There's definitely more randomness, in the events that may or may not reward specialization or punish neglect as well as in the draft with its relative lack of look-ahead. Not sure about the balance, but then I don't know about TtA either. It is also a long game, though not quite as long as TtA at any given player count.

Funny story: I've only ever played this solo.  I haven't played with the lady because the rules state that it is brutally cutthroat for just two players, and I live pretty far away from my gaming buddies nowadays.
Solo, however, is quite a fun experience.  I feel like the only missed opportunity is how they dealt with Wars (they can only hurt you in the solo variant) but overall it is an enjoyable experience that makes you think in a good way.

Interesting first play, like a dumbed down version of through the ages. The military is wishy washy, but within the design I can't see how direct conflict one on one would have worked. I enjoy the game but its not superior to Through the Ages for me, just shorter and thus easier to get to the table. 

I am now thinking the solo mode may be more enjoyable for me than the multiplayer mode. It takes away some of the pointlessness of the military.  

I also own the dynasties expansion.

Initial rating based on play of a 3 person game at chieftain level through age 3.  The game plays quickly, with minimal downtime.  Some time is needed each turn to study the progress cards available, and you need to be able to adjust your plans to which cards are on the board.  This game really captures the civilization building experience without a ton of rules or long game play.  It's an outstanding "civ-lite" game.

First impression.  I enjoyed this game.  It ran a little long, so I would hope it can speed up a tick.  The theme is good.  I sensed a strong bias towards heavy military development.  So while this looks like a Civ game, it felt more like a conflict game.  

But the conflict is not map based.  You merely damage the other players resources/scores.  The game system felt tough.  I mainly struggled against the system, the adversity from the other players as less than half of the struggle.

Initially, I was dubious that I wanted extra workers - the price seemed quite high.  But having them out there and working is a boon for endgame scoring.  Better to have them, and break even maintaining them, as they will pay off at the end.

If this boils down to a 2 hour game, I might just have to buy a copy for game nights at the club.  If it stays at the 3 hour mark, I will likely wait for it to arrive once in a while.

Good civilisation card game. Comparison with Through the Ages is unavoidable. Very similar and although I prefer Through the Ages, there is also room for Nations. Wars are better handled in Nations as the outcome can be mitigated via a balanced society, but still focus needed on military (e.g. for colonies). Nations also has a shorter playing time. I like the way you can shift the main focus of your civilisation in the gradual build-up to the "perfect" nation.

Multi-player solitaire (not my thing). First game took 3-3.5 hrs with 3p. Would get worse with more bodies. Art pretty bad. Dynamics are interesting but honestly I think the lack of warfare is a drawback more than a benefit - all you can do is hold an economy hostage (not fun) or cost them a few points (huge deal - points are so tight in this game).

Not recommended - see Clash of Cultures for better Civ fun.

Even though the game is still a prototype, if it hit the shelves now, I'd buy it without a second thought. Yes, it's that good. Game is something like 7 wonders (drafting changed to rochester draft) combined with agricola. And that is some serious combination there.

There are some balancing to be done, few small things to fix here and there, but it feels really good. Can't say anything about components yet, but prototype had some serious clarity problems, but I trust they will be fixed.

This will be a must buy for every eurogamer who enjoy CIV style games.

Fuck me! First I thought this might be interesting game, but after half of the game (90 minutes played) I was ready to move on - the rest of the game (another 90 minutes) was more or less pain to me AND I wasn't even the guy who was left behind to collect only dust (one of us was really kicked in a military). Nations is just way too long compared to what it is: it's kind of puzzle game where the luck of draw is in a major role and the game has a huge rich-get-richer aspect as well. Not for me, definitely.

RATING: N/A
From the humble beginnings of civilization through the historical ages of progress, mankind has lived, fought, and built together in nations. Great nations protect and provide for their own, while fighting and competing against both other nations and nature itself. Nations must provide food and stability as the population increases. They must build a productive economy. And all the while, they must amaze the world with their great achievements to build up their heritage as the greatest nations in the history of mankind!

Nations is an intense historical board game for 1–5 players that takes 40 minutes per player to play. Players control the fate of nations from their humble start in prehistoric times until the beginning of World War I. The nations constantly compete against each other and must balance immediate needs, long-term growth, threats, and opportunities.

RATING: 6.2
I still have not played Through the Ages so I can not make comparisons here. Nations is a civilisation game with lots of cards, some worker placementish mechanism (but your workers are not competing for common action spaces), a few distinct resource types, a few different card types (for some reason, feeling like - probably only because of the artwork - somewhat Sankt Petersburg-like)... and nothing really outstanding. This is not a bad game but I can't name anything to recommend it for. For such a long civilisation game I didn't even really feel the theme which should be the point of it all. Heck, I didn't even feel a real story arc to the game. But yes, this game is rather long (3 hours or more) and when in a long game like this there is no catch-up mechanism it is a bit painful to have a clear winner after one hour or so. I did not hate the experience at all but can't name a civilisation game (long or short) I enjoyed less than this one either. I mean, hey, why is it rated and ranked higher than Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game, The Setlers of Catan, La Cittá, Roll Through the Ages: The Bronze Age, Rise of Empires, Olympos, Olympus and so on (it is even rated higher than Tigris & Euphrates and 7 wonders)? I guess that must be some cult of the new hype.

edit, one year later: yes it seems it is - now Tigris and 7 wonders are above this one at least.

To me, this is straight up replaced and improved "Through the Ages".

Still relatively long (2h+) and involved, but certainly much more playable than TtA.  Well worth playing if you have long enough to invest.

RATING: 4
It's a civilization building game similar to Thought the ages which has no world map.

It's basically a resource management game where it's hard to be balanced in all type of resources. There is a worker placement aspect to the game,  but I don't find it problematic because people place workers on their own board. So there is no scaling problems with various amount of players. Also the workers stay there from turn to turn but they can be moved by paying the cost.

If you like resource management games, then this game should be for you, but there are a few issues I want to point out.

First, you can get extra workers but their maintenance cost is so expensive that it's impossible to use that extra worker to even repay it's maintenance cost. So I think the wheat maintenance cost are way too strong. -1 or -2 wheat would have been more acceptable than -3.

While those that gives -3 stability, that's a huge  drawback considering My stability has been wondering between 2-4 for the whole game. Until I realized that there are no penalty for being in revolt beside being last all the time. So I could just take all 4 meaples with -12 stability, be last all the time, and it would have been better than taking no meaple and be last half of the time.

Battle cards are also not more effective as the ages progress. All cards becomes more and more powerful as the age progress except the battle cards. I know that they are variable to your unit strength, but still, a bonus, or a different selection of resource could have been interesting.

Finally, I don't know why publishers thinks you have unlimited space to store your game because the box of the game is so huge for what it has. 

Second, the game is not worth 100$. Seriously, there are a bunch of meeples, 1 board, a few sheets, and cards. It would have fit in a thinner box or in half the box if the board was foldable. 

Class of cultures has cool miniatures and it's selling price is lower (80$).

A good civilization game, somewhat similar with "Through The Ages", but with much more variability (card decks). It has a great theme with hsistoric elements just like Through The Ages.  War/aggression and events tactics overall have a little less of an impact but randomness could create major shifts on your Nation but you can usually see bad things coming that round, unlike in TtA.  In TtA, you can be unknowingly blindsided by (unseen) Event cards, but in Nations, you can account for and plan for mitigating circumstances.  The only issue with Nations is that if one player does poorly, it will unravel unto other players significantly more or conversely help other Nations improve.  

My biggest thing against Nations (being a "great" game) is that I wish the card display were one additional column or one additional row more for more cards.  If certain cards (resource producers) do not come out sufficient enough, this can create havoc with one or two nations, which mostly unravels and creates a falling behind problem.  I would suggest an addition column of cards based on # of players (maybe three or four more).  Just a little, not too much more.

[In terms of comparing such civilization/nation building games, I also really like Clash of Cultures.  CoC does not have the historical theme elements but the game play and mechanics are a little better when you play with the variable ending, which I personally prefer.]

RATING: 8
First Impression:

I can understand the comparisons to Through the Ages.  This one is lighter and plays much more simply.  Calculating military and keeping track of production and population is much easier to do in this one.  There is still the same tension between trying to build a balanced (or not) engine to produce what you need in the moment.  This game feels a bit more tactical in nature as you respond to the event and the game in the current round of the age more so than what you know may be coming down the road.  Just because this game distills Civilization down to the basic essence does not mean one cannot be destroyed - quite easy actually for this game to knock you down and keep one down but there is often also room to get back and get back into the fight.  

The massive amount of cards in this game means that no two games will ever be the same.  One can never count on cards to come out on the display.  While military is more indirect and effects everyone (instead of TtA's targeted attacks), there can still be a considerable pain factor.  There are ways to mitigate the damage if one increases one's stability factor high enough - might only lose one VP.

Very engaging every turn and even with 5 players every action can have an impact on everyone. :) Great Balance, Great gameplay! Wow... if you get a chance give this one a play! Good luck getting a copy.

Updated to a 10... its just one of the games that I don't think Ill ever say no to playing if someone makes a suggestion.

Played recently, had a great experience. Longish (compared to most Euros), but moved along okay and it was fun watching my civilization take shape. Multiple paths to victory -- I went the military route and actually tied for first with a player who never had a single military card!

I like civ building games, but I don't like civ building games without a map of some kind. 

That preference aside however, while I did like Through the Ages, this game streamlines a lot of things that didn't need streamlining and made the things I didn't like in TtA worse.

I like this game a lot.  It is Through the Ages stream-lined, but it is still a pretty heavy game.  We play 2 player and it plays well that way.  The one potential issue is that the game can be done in the first few rounds if one player becomes to strong.  However, you can just start over.  Tight games are a lot of fun.

A more accessible version of Through the Ages. It's not quite as harsh but there seem to be more ways to get punished other than with military. This game runs a lot more smoothly than Through the Ages but you still need to invest a lot of time into it to be competitive and the play time is not cut that much from its cousin.

Initial thoughts: On the one hand, the game plays very well. Everything just sort of makes sense. On the other hand, it's not a pretty game by any means. The art and graphic design did nothing for me. It was functional, but simultaneously the opposite of interesting. Which is too bad, because, as I said, the game itself is rock solid. I wish I wanted to add it to my collection.﻿

I like this game more than [b]Through the Ages[/b]. The wars and events can really cripple you, but nothing compared to Napoleon's Holy Air Strikes . Even though you can not attack a certain player, there is still a lot of player interactions. You have to be on your toes all the time and to be sure no one can cause you to lose your position if they do everything they can to do it. If you pass too early, people will built their armies and start a war which you are going to lose. Or they increase their Stability and cause you to lose something precious (Workers, Food, Culture or even Victory Points). Losing Wars isn't always bad as you can negate the effects with high Stability, but you will always lose 1 Victory Point.

The game is more tactical than strategical and that's probably why I like it better than [b]TtA[/b], in which I usually end up short of everything and get beaten up badly.

RATING: 6
Through the Ages never clicked, but this game did. Less fiddly, and better overview makes it easier to grasp. I think the War-mechanism is much better here. A player with a non-war focus can easily catch up later, however, I have yet to figure out how to win completely without an army.

I'm ought to warn people that that one can end up in a negative spiral, which significantly lowers the enjoyment.

Another go at the three hour Civ game, and one that might be reaching closer to the grail than most attempts in the past. A lot of things work very well, from the tableau of available cards to the resource differentation, but my favorite is probably how the workers are handled. Most things that did not work quite as well can be blamed more on the haphazard rule book than on the game itself.

The current rating of 7 is rather lowballing it; my first and only game so far felt more like an 8. I am, however, a bit afraid of how the game will be balanced out once the we progress to the advanced card decks and the culture tableaus. Streakiness of the deck might become an issue, I guess. If those fears turn out to be unfounded, this will be a keeper.

My favorite civ builder. It plays fast and stays true to civilization building. Each era brings fun upgrades and no one strategy will dominate every game. The A and B sides and levels on the cards allow the game to scale in difficulty for those new to the game. The 90-minute play time is icing on the cake, allowing you to build an engine and run it effectively while not dragging on all night.

Setup time can be on the long side, but a good organizer drops it significantly.

After one play it is a 5. I will try it again, but I have concerns that this is another game where you waste a lot of time doing things that don't mean much in the end (like Goa). 

I worry one people know the cards there will be a prescribed path. I also worry that the only scoring that really matter is the ones you get from your guys every other round, that the wars and the stability and the books are in the end not enough to make it matter. (I.E) this round you got 1 more than me, next one i get one more than you etc.  

Even if i am wrong the game play still feels very euro bland to me.

My first Civ game besides 7 Wonders, so i can't compare it to others in the genre really. First impressions, it took forever to play. i like euros, but 3 hours later, i was wore out. I enjoyed how your workers stayed on the board as long as you wanted them there. I also enjoyed the importance of military, and how you need it for raiding as well as winning wars. I liked how you were penalized for not winning the war, or for being last place in some of the round's objectives. I thought that penalizing players added a great tension to the game, although it wasn't forgiving to the players who were in last place; that kind of turned it into a the rich get richer and the poor get poorer kinda situation. The rounds just took forever...i wish you could do most of your actions simultaneously rather than taking turns. and the iconography on the cards can be a little confusing, i found myself having to explain which one pays now and which one pays later a few times, as well as explaining that the stability track always adjusts cause its not just a one time thing. But overall i enjoyed the experience of playing Nations, i found it unique and challenging.

Heavy and long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
What I like:
- Tight resources
- Somewhat forgiving if you don't have enough resources
- Not much downtime between turns
- Losses from wars/events are fixed
- The cost isn't too high to get into later age technologies
- No limit on the number of actions you can do per turn as long as you have the resources

What I didn't like:
- Gameplay is still too long for us.  A 4-player game takes us 2.5-3 hours
- The event/war penalties in the later ages are pretty painful
- There isn't really a sense of upgrading because you have to repay to place your workers when you cover an existing building
- Your civilization can change quite drastically from turn to turn since each turn you're focusing on the current event.

RATING: 8.5
Received in trade for Sid Meier's Civilization with Wisdom and Warfare 7/15/16.

Low downtime due to quick turn mechanics.  The culture track is less dynamic at 2p, but the game does become VERY cuthroat.  Replayability is through the roof.  Adding in the Dynasties expansion yields 17 very different nations to play with.  Each game also sees different cards, as we only go through maybe 1/5 of each age's deck per game.  For a relatively abstracted card game, a lot of it feels thematic.  Components are pretty bad quality though, especially considering MSRP.

We really enjoy how the battles and military aren't very "Take-That" and aren't overly mean.  The occasional war can sometimes really screw someone over, but it's not malicious like it is in Sid Meier's Civ.

When combining decks, it's completely necessary to institute the lower variance variant.

My group and I thought this did a great job of being a Civilization game. First play, with learning and rules, took us about 6.5 hours. A little long, but we definitely picked up speed 3/4 of the way through. We all loved it; felt like the ages flowed nicely and everything flowed elegantly. The only problem we had was some of the wording on the card is obtuse and not explained in the rules. Cannot wait to play this one again; very fun.

Nagyon szerettem volna kipróbálni és sajnos nagyon nem jött be. 5 fővel nyomtuk és nagyon elnyúlt a játék, kisebb-nagyobb szünetekkel kb. 5 órán keresztül tartott, és már kb. a felénél lehetett látni, hogy ki fog nyerni és ez ellen nem sok mindent tudtunk tenni. Játék közben hasonló érzésem volt, mint Catanozás közben (annak ellenére, hogy az általam adott értékelésen kívül a két játéknak nem sok köze van egymáshoz): sokkal hosszabb a kelleténél, és ha az ember lemarad, akkor onnantól kezdve csak asszisztál a győztesnek és közben unatkozik...

Lehet, hogy több parti tapasztalatával (és kisebb játékosszámmal) jobb lenne a játékélmény, de pont az a baj ezekkel a bazi hosszú és könyörtelen játékokkal, hogy az embernek egy életre elveszik a kedvét attól, hogy adjon nekik még egy esélyt.

My rating is provisional, as I have only played twice so far.  However, I really like Nations, though I don't think this is the TtA killer it's supposed to be.  

There are aspects to both I prefer over the other, and I'll keep both in my collection.

I think Nations is more accessible, and is DEFINITELY easier to teach, which is a big plus.

Greatly improve by Dynasties expansion. Score increased.

I love this game. Even when I don't do great, I still feel as if I've really accomplished cool things by the end of the game. It takes a lot of time and mental energy to get through, but it is well more than worth it.

We don't suffer from AP too much in this game, which is nice. The only downside I really see is that setting up the decks can be a real time-burner, although dealing with each deck as we get to the appropriate age seems to make this less of a bother for me.

Addendum: The solo play is very satisfying in this game.

I really like tactical, chaotic games such as Nations. If you don't, or if you're looking for more of a feeling of genuinely building a civilization, stick with TtA.

In Nations, each round is its own mini-puzzle with your incentives based on that round's randomly drawn event as well as a looming threat of war. Speaking of which, war seems to be a huge part of the game. If both your military and civil happiness track are low, you will be constantly screwed by the war cards and left spinning your wheels, unable to grow your civilization.

The handicapping method (King, Chieftain, etc.) is novel and allows people at different skill levels to compete.

The endgame is somewhat unsatisfying with simply adding up points on cards and 1/10 VP each for all other resources and tracks.

For me, the game runs a shade long (2.5 hr for 3 players) to be pulled out during every session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Every time I play Nations I have a pretty good time. This is a game that is quite long but doesn't quite overstay it's welcome that is enjoyable to play even when you lose. I think there is a ton of nuance to the game.

I don't think this game will ever reach my Top 5 Games though. It's pretty long and even though the pacing is fine, there isn't enough immersion and there isn't anything truly clever or elegant about the game.

RATING: 7
03/15/14 Played a three-player game in 3.5 hours, at Chieftain level, using the "A" sides of the player mats. 
I own Through the Ages, and I was quite taken aback how this game basically copies about 80% of that game. Yet for some reason Nations costs almost twice as much even though it has less stuff in the box! I like TtA so I was predisposed to like Nations. The rules says a three-player game should take two hours. Ha! It took us almost twice that long. Maybe, just maybe, experienced players could get 'r done in two hours, but I doubt it. I do not think I'd want to play the game with a full compliment of five; it would take too long. I can't help but compare Nations to Through the Ages. Nations is a little shorter, a little less complex, and a little less fiddly. Yet that comes at a price, as one receives less satisfaction in shaping/tailoring one's empire. I do find it odd that advisors can remain alive and active the entire game (while leaders and scientists in TtA die off regularly, as they should). The war mechanism in Nations is OK, but it really doesn't feel like you're fighting (its more like a plague that players can inoculate themselves against), whereas wars in TtA do. Nations is a good game, but Through the Ages is a little better. 
08/16/14 Played a four-player game in four hours, at Chieftain level, using the "A" sides of the player mats. 
07/11/15 Played a three-player game in three hours, at Prince level, using the "B" sides of the player mats.

RATING: 6
Solid game, but too long for what it is. Less fiddly than TtA, so that is good, but still, it is basically an exercise of buying cards and placing meeples that will have you moving up and or down charts, with every round random events intervening. The board is just a display for administration and shopping. Instead I like my games with boardplay full of interaction. Definitely with this playing time I am more critical about that.

Bland, boring artwork.  Mechanics to keep others interested in your turn are rather dull, but do work.  Does NOT feel like you are building an empire, as you constantly are replacing cards that your not really invested in other than a number upgrade.

A solid design, but at least with two players the game slows down to a crawl as both players try to calculate their way to victory. The graphic design looks like it has been stolen from the '80s, which isn't exactly a good thing. This game made me realize what people mean by saying that a game plays like a spread sheet. This is probably a really good and skillful game but it's also almost as dry as it gets. I could try it once again with more than two players.

RATING: 7.5
This is probably the limit of how simple I would want my civ games to be.  Leveling up isn't quite as joyful here as in Through the Ages or Civilization.  On the other hand, providing alternatives to the arms race is nice.  More puzzle like than narrative driven.

This game seriously did not work for us.  One player wanted to play differently and decided to forego military.  He was utterly devastated.  Every turn he seemed to lose resources, so could essentially do nothing all game.  The odd way of collecting stone, the ease with which we maxed out on the military chart, the inability to do any planning due to the number of cards all added together to one big mess.  Why would we want to have more meeples?  Not enough resources to use them anyway.  My big ing was colonies, but none showed up.  And does the Egyptian wonder start built, or not?  Plus, the box is full of a good half-day's worth of air.  A major disappointment for me.

Tried again with the correct rules and liked it even less.  Runaway leaders, no chance to plan anything because of the total random card array, bad artwork.  WoW, this is just a poor game overall.

Nearly impossible not to mention [thing=25613]that other civ game[/thing]. You draft cards: leaders, wonders and technology are still here. You can build up your army but now it's not the same arms race and you can take a defensive stance instead. What's really makes Nations stand out is that players aren't taking all of their actions at once. Instead you perform a micro-action and that continues around the table until you pass out of the round. Nations is more a game of timing. The decisions are still tough but it's not the AP-fest that pushed TtA into the computer-only category for me. 

UPDATE: Knocked down a point, already in my second game. Came across a scenario where I just continued to lose points and get further behind making for a long, frustrating night.

*Dec 2013* 2 Plays with the recommended basic starting cards. I like it, a good game. It's definitely a lighter Through the Ages, though that game kicks this one's butt (which isn't saying much, as that game kicks almost every other game in the butt). 

Still, worth playing and a good choice for anyone that could never wrap their head around TtA but still wanted a Civ game like this.

First solo endeavor did not leave me impressed. The cards do seem quite incremental. Also disappointed that so many cards do basically the same.

After two real plays my opinion has improved to calling this a good but not great game. It is certainly quite unforgiving regarding play errors and the ease of switching between military and stability, and back, make it somewhat unthematic imho. Overall, the game is rather mathy and despite the nation building, no real story or history is created. Largely, it is a dance of priorities, opportunities and some gambles. Well, still not bad at all, but also not more than  a solid 8.

Not that complicated to get in than Through the ages, but this is only a tactical game. You can only react to the cards you can buy. If they cost 1 or 3 is luck, which events will struck you is only luck. And playing a 5 player game in 4 hours which is only tactical is not my favorite hobby of "wasting" time. I also think that players who know and like TTA rate this one much lower

RATING: 8
One cannot play or review Nations without comparing it to Through the Ages. TtA stands out as the superior game from a design standpoint; it's balanced, beautiful, brutal. But I believe Nations might be more fun. First and foremost, it is less punishing, and this allows play between players of a greater skill disparity (even without the overt handicap capability). This also makes it less depressing. While I can't say there are more paths to victory, as TtA contains dozens of combos and such, Nations feels more open to more styles of play, and that makes it less stressful and more enjoyable for me. I need to give it more plays, but so far I like it.

We've thoroughly enjoyed our first ten games. It's not particularly difficult to learn, but your appreciation of the game grows with experience. I've never played TTA as it seemed too long, but I always regretted that I missed out. No longer. We play two player games of Nations in 90 minutes. We are totally absorbed. It's tense, competitive, and very challenging. Compliments to the designers for the game's flexibility, variability, and depth, and to their willingness to answer rules questions. If you're an experienced games it will take you several games until you're ready for the full suite of cards and the B sides. And you should have no trouble learning the game in its two player version. This is one of the most interesting and elegant games I've played this year.

Very well design civ game.

With simple rules and very simple to explain and understand but with so many choices and decisions to be made that adds a level of heaviness to the game that the rules don't show.

Only played with the "Base" cards, so I expect that with the advanced and expert cards the game will escalate in difficult choice

RATING: 6
Rating after 2 plays. Better than Through the Ages, but for me that's not saying much. To me this feels like a civ-building version of Saint Petersburg. There's a bunch of cards of several different types, a bunch of them come out every round, and you have to react and figure out which ones to go after. Rinse and repeat. I'm horrible at Saint Petersburg, and seemingly equally horrible at Nations. I tend to be a slow, plodding thinker, and as such I don't do well at games that require me to quickly assess a situation and choose the right tactical response. It's just too much for me to absorb, and so I'm stuck between either making a quick choice which is almost always wrong, or getting all AP and taking horribly long turns. Neither choice is very appealing, but I hate being the AP guy at the table, so I usually just choose the first option, with predictable results. 

Add in the fact that your opponents can do things that royally screw you over (although admittedly, it's not nearly as bad in Nations as it is in Through the Ages), and the result is that I just end up making a giant mess of things. And if you're like me and not fully grasping everything that's going on at any given moment, then those screw-you moves always seem to come out of left field, at the worst possible moment.

I suppose if I played it a few more times and gained some familiarity with the cards and the different civilizations, I might be able to play semi-competently, but I'm not sure the payoff is worth it. I seriously doubt I'll ever win at this game, no matter how many times I play.

A very good deep civ game based on cards. It can be likened to "7 Wonders" on steroids!
The number and variety of cards give the game high Replayability.
There are multiple routes to victory and a useful handicap method to allow play between ayers of varying experience.
The only downside is the runtime which can be 60 minutes per player when learning the game. Hopefully this will WDice to a more reasonable 40 minutes in later games. That said, the game keeps a high level of interest despite the runtime.

Not faulting it for borrowing from the best (TTA), but faulted for not borrowing what made it the best. Completely playable, but lacked tension and the card-subset per game made luck of the draw too influential on player strategies. Should be played very tactically for the least frustration. Also not a fan of the bland scoring and teeth pulling required to gain new workers that essentially had to work to pay their own costs. Still, recommended for civilization fans to at least try.

RATING: 7
I hear this is like a light version of Through the Ages, which suits me fine, since the length & weight here seemed just fine. The rating might rise with more plays, but then again I don't know if there will be any, because although I liked the game, it felt a bit dry & off-putting. 

The main reason for this dissonance is probably the lack of flavor in the visual style. Actually I found the visuals of the game somewhat bland and unpleasant, sometimes even ugly. Some of the pictures look like something a schoolboy would draw. I even dislike the art in the box cover.

Update 2016.05.19:  Played another game, and my rating has gone from 7 to 9.  Mainly because the rules were properly explained (approx. 30 minutes), and we didn't rush through (4 hours for 4 players).  I still think Through the Ages is the better civilization game.  As I stated after my first play, I still miss the sense of Government, Science and upgrading technology from TtA.  The way Wars work vs. Stability of a nation is interesting, but I'm not sure it is thematic (true to life) or that I like it.  Overall though, excellent game that I would rarely turn down playing (probably due to length of game).

After 1 play, I don't know.  Good game I guess.  We played it in a little over 2 hours, but the rules explanation was rushed, and so was the game play.  First time play of this game where rules are properly explained, and you have time to read and understand the cards will take 3-4 hours for 4 players.  

No science or government?  No sense of upgrading what you've already built as in TtA (i.e. Iron to Coal), just build something new and lose all previous investments (i.e. Meeples).  

Given the chance, I would play this game again, but I'd rather play Through the Ages.  Definitely not something I would consider purchasing.  More bang for the buck by far with Through the Ages, SM:Civ or Clash of Cultures.

Update 2017.11.30:  Played 3rd time with Dynasties expansion.  Well I gotta say this is a very good Civ game.  There are things I like about it better than Through the Ages, and other things I don't.  I think I now have to give the nod to Nations, because there are so many cards that are available to purchase during each round, which really ups the replayability through the roof.

My Civ game of choice. Replaced Through the Ages for me, because it offers the same depth with just as much depth. The only real niggling problem I have with the game is that the card pool can be very low (and skewed) with 2, and the length increases exponentially with more. 3 seems to be the sweet spot for me on this one.

An ambitious attempt to streamline a civilization game into a card game. I like how you must balance the different resources and consider your relative positions to the other players in different tracks.

Watered down TtA with massively streamlined (too streamlined maybe?) mechanics, plays quickly, no fiddly runaway circular chits, players now take turns to take actions which makes loads more sense, better art than TtA though the art is not actually that great, neat solo rules, interesting 'solution' to wars which now affect everyone, variable civ powers, no modern era (did they hold this back for an expansion?) which I miss, tidier concept of nation Stability, all around pretty great Diet implementation of Vlaada's masterpiece.

Oddly enough this will probably see a lot more playtime than TtA because of its streamlined nature.


UPDATE 07/02/14:

This was an intriguing prospect from the outset, a pared down TtA without all the hassle of setup and tear-down, taking it in turns to take turns - like Eclipse (instead of taking all your actions at once in TtA and then going to put the pizzas in whilst you wait for your next turn), less hassle of upkeep and corruption, more even-handed wars that don’t effectively remove players from the game for hours, etc. So I squeezed it in as a last minute Christmas 2013 purchase before the gaming embargo slammed down. It had good stock for me coming from the Lautapeli guys who made Eclipse, and when I opened the box I was only mildly disappointed to see that they’d taken the bland graphic design of TtA and made it…. slightly less bland. The artwork is a moderate improvement, and the variety of cards is great. That you’ll only get to see a handful of them each game increases replayability but changes it up from a strategic race to grab the cards you know are eventually coming (in TtA) to a reactive, tactical game based on what might be coming down the line. It’s unlikely but you might never see any Leaders for example. Or Advisors as Nations calls them.
It plays a hell of a lot faster than TtA - in one session in January we were able to play three games in one evening. The solo option is great too and as I’ve said elsewhere it is a doddle to grasp, but a bugger to master, as it should be, and is a great tool for learning the game. There are extra event tiles included specifically for the solo game and a lot of thought has clearly gone into this side of it, which I appreciate, and it rates your play by comparing you to a famous leader like the old Civ PC games used to, so you have a score to strive to beat each time.
I've played about 8 solo games now and would happily break it out again soon. This potentially gives me an unfair advantage in multiplayer games, but you can (and I have) offset that by using the included setup rules to start off on a harder level to other players by producing less resources each turn.
On the whole, I love it and think it will replace TtA in 'real life' for the most part, mainly due to play time, though I will never part with my TtA.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is exceptionally good. It's like Through the Ages in that you use purchase and use cards to build up your empire. It's quicker, slightly easier, and most importantly less fiddly than TTA in terms of pushing and managing cubes. 

The game is more random than TTA because not all cards will come out everygame, which makes it an even more tactical game than TTA - some may find this an advantage, some may not.

I feel that the freshness of the game, and the slightly more variable games and the fact that it is easier and shorter, makes me want to play this over TTA right now. 

However, one minor issue of the game is it can be frustrating to play if you are being put into a poor position (either because you played poorly or you just have bad luck) Unlike TTA, such consqeuence can be justified mostly because of your poor moves.

RATING: 7.5
In this Civilization building game, each player first chooses a nation (Persia, Egypt, China, Greece, Rome). Over 8 rounds, players take actions: choosing a card from the display, moving an architect to a wonder, deploying a worker, or using special actions on cards. Each round there is an event that one has to manage, and there could be wars. Wars are resolved by comparing the military value of the player who started the war to others to see their affect on you. Stability can be used to mitigate wars, while books help you gain VPs.  At the beginning of each round, each player also chooses resources from food/stone/ore/worker. 

This is a very engaging game, as you slowly build up your civilization. You are always on the knife edge, as one mistake could collapse your game. There is a ton of tension as you try to manage your nation. It's a decent game, but it can be long (my first game clocked in at 5 hours for four people), but I was fully engaged the whole time. I also do worry about someone making a mistake and being out of it early.  Still, I'm looking forward to more plays. I think the sweet spot for this game is with 3 players.

Superior implementation of the systems of 'Through the Ages' with less fiddly book-keeping and where the military is less of the 'be-all-and-end-all' of whether you win or not. Probably my favourite game with the 'civilization' theme, of which they are clearly many.

[b]Nations[/b]

A 7 based on my first basic game play (2 players):
Nations doesn't really give me the feel I want from a civilization game. It is rushed and too transitory, with very little direct interaction. Your civilizations "achievements" are so quickly replaced by new ones, that as soon as you get familiar with your new found capabilities they are replaced with new ones. I doubt its nature will change after I add the advanced and expert cards.

Nations is a race, not a journey. Perhaps Through the Ages is more the journey that I prefer. Shall have to try it out someday.

After a few more 2 player games, I've accepted that it's more of a race of who best balances their economic engine, and I've raised my rating somewhat... BUT... something is missing from this game. I´d name this thing Depth.

While this game leads to some serious analysis paralysis in a few of my friends, I will never say NO to a game of Nations. The random cards that appear each round offer some hilarious scenarios. For example, when I build the Great Wall of China...in Rome. Or when I construct a Sacrificial Alter, alongside my modern bank, to restore stability to my nation.

I think this game has a lot of good ideas. The various resources of gold, food, ore, etc and the various tracks of military/stability and the cards and player boards are, on paper, quite good ideas for an abstract Civ game.

But in my opinion, this fails on a few fronts. Thematically, the civilizations make no sense as you can have something like Pocahontas in China. The cards are random, as are the events and I overall find the randomness unthematic and to give the game a bit of luck that I dislike. Mechanically, turn by turn actions and upkeeps make this a very punishing game and not that fun. Lastly for a Civ, there's no map or tech tree.

Good game. It is almost the same as TTA with a few small nuances that I think make the game better in a way. Turns are shorter and dealing with everything is more simple and elegant. Wars are not as relevant as in TTA. Better with 2-3 players, tops.

Loved my first play and want to play it more but holy crap, you really need to pay attention at what you do, because this game is merciless.  Well, the players are but the game heavily suggests them to declare wars and be selfish.

Update 1:  The complexity and length of play make it a very difficult game to just bring out for my usual groups, but I do want to play it again.

Update 2:  Hard to bring to the table and the gameplay economy is basically keeping your workers in particular spots just changing them when there's a better spot or to engage in war or instability.  It wasn't as interesting a worker economy as it were pure worker placement, giving you the options to do as much as you wanted.  It just wasn't as enjoyable for a game with a myriad of cards.

Nations é um jogo relativamente complicado - a temática está ali, mas de forma meio abstrata. O objetivo é fazer a nação mais poderosa, produzindo recursos, escolhendo conselheiros, construindo maravilhas e, claro, guerreando. Bom para quem gosta de jogos de civilization building e tem paciência para fazer muita conta monitorando linhas paralelas de recursos.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple and brief rules, and the gameflow is very elegant; the game solves all the issues with fast and simple mechanics.

These simple rules are decitful: they create a very deep game.

The mechanic of doing one action at a time (instead of the full turn, like TTA) creates tension and dynamism.

Events, cards and the action of the other players will create very different games, and preset strategies will never be used. Replayability will not be an issue.

The players have different abilities and starting resources that feels different (not a lot, but it's not "only 1 special feature per race"), but contrary to other games, this doesn't mark their strategy to be followed on the long run.

Things change a lot during the 8 turns that make each game. You can be the most militaristic nation one turn, and 2 turns after have no army at all. This provides a sense of history and civilization that very few games do.

Another difference with the average games of this genre: miltary is still a key aspect, but it's not possible for several players to join their forces to demolish another one.

Idiom is not a big barrier.


On the other side, games are longer than advertised. My first game (5 players) lasted 4 hours. I think it should have been designed as a 4 player maximum.

Contrary to what I've read, it's not possible to win without building a heavy military (at least once in the game).

I might increase the rating after more games.

BTW, I didn't mention this game is heavily (very heavily) based on Through The Ages. It's a streamlined TTA.

OK. Let's do a little comparison exercise, shall we?

Nations was released at Essen 2013. I didn't buy it at first, although it was on my wishlist. And, without any doubt even now, justifiably so. When I played it a few months later, it was an enjoyable streamlined slider-balancing for 2-5 players.

One game I DID receive from my Essen Wishlist was Prosperity. It was an enjoyable, streamlined slider-balancing for 2-4 players.

Notice anything familiar here? Ultimately, I rank this one lower due to its higher cost, longer play time and poorly-integrated chrome.

Nations is more or less EXACTLY THE SAME GAME as Prosperity. It has added a more glorious theme, and a token fifth player, sure. But it has also taken away: in the random and ultimately game-changing event cards

Why is one ranked nearly 2000 places below the other on this site? God only knows...

RATING: 8
A Civ building game that is playable in a decent timeframe. 
What I really enjoy in this one is the way war is handled, as it's kind of indirect and allows for playing truely a different strategy as you still have to take measures to not be hit by the war too much, but it's not just via military. In many games I just have the feeling once someone starts the fighting, the main (or only) way is doing the same and then it escaltes, but it is really quiet different here. 

Edit: As the expansion is not gonna come out in german apparently and with the new version of Through the Ages out and us actually enjoying that maybe even a bit better in Nations, this one is probably gonna go on the trade list.

comment after 3 games: this game IS a reduced version of Through The Ages, there are a lot of identical aspects. Its most important difference is the (slightly) better components and that it can be explained to a newbie withing 15 minutes and without any preliminary training session!
Some aspects of TTA have been simplified, in particular the production of science, and this is bad. Moreover, battles are ridiculously identical: it doesn't matter whether you are at Cannes or at Waterloo, the result is the same: choice among rocks, food and culture.
However the game flows smoothly, it can be played immediately by new players, there is a very large variety of situations, mostly due to the fact that less than half the cards are used per game.
Very very good work! I would only add some flavor to battle and wars artworks.

I don't know how best to describe it. It's 8 rounds of resource management while trying to build a civilization.  But it's brutal. Each round feels like the game is trying to beat you down and pit you against your opponents in a Euro way... the kind of Euro way that hurts because the game makes you want to make your friends suffer and vice versa.  Yet somehow everyone survives and creates something resembling a civilization.  You are always competing for highest, most, lowest or fewest.  I don't know if I like it, love it, or just enjoy the shared torture.  I don't know...  Maybe it's just the people I game with.

Halfway through my first game, I was ready to give Nations an ‘8’. However, in the final two rounds, practically no usable cards turned up, leaving me and another player with nothing to do but pass and let the game take its course. Thus, the game's fairly engaging theme and gameplay are marred by poor balance and randomness. The victor is determined not by strategy, but by the luck of the cards that turn up in the final rounds.

As far as components go, the cards are nice, but the boards are thin and appear to warp easily. This might be acceptable if Nations wasn't twice as expensive as most comparable games.

RATING: 7
Oy! A doozy this game was! Just as dense and time-consuming as you would think a card-drafting-based Civilization game would be. With 4 or 5 players, you're easily looking at a 4 hour plus game! I can't fault the game because I wouldn't know where to shave time off. The game play isn't as confusing as most Civ games because there are usually too many components to "build my engine" but your choices are actually limited. Game play is similar to St. Petersburg, mixed in with your basic worker placement and resource management-type game. I'm making this sound easier than it actually is. It's not. It hurt my brain. I'm just not built for this type of game. But it's less painless than others of this type, I guess. Paulo loved it. Of course.

RATING: 8
A nice streamlining of Through The Ages. While TtA was about the cards but also had a ton of accounting, this is all about the cards. You start with 5 cards, each of which give you various combinations of money, stone, culture, military, and food. Allocate your 5 meeples among these as you please, and that sets out what your economy will produce. Use gold to buy more efficient cards to replace those you have. Reallocate your meeples to the more efficient cards using stone. Make sure you get enough allocated to military, because even though there's no direct aggression, being first in military gives you first pick of the new cards next turn (awesome advantage) as well as avoid penalties whenever someone pays for a war card. You can also buy cards to give you one-off benefits, cards that you can pay stone to build wonders (for ongoing benefits), and country cards you can take if you have high enough military (for more ongoing benefits). All of which should sound eerily similar to TtA fans. Build up your culture production as most culture each round earns VPs, but there's plenty of VPs in building higher level stuff as well. Once you've spent your gold, racing in turn order to draft the best cards, then it's just a matter of doing the non-player-interactive stuff, like allocating your meeples. So reviewing the new cards and re-evaluating when your pets are taken is where the downtime is. The decision tradeoffs are the inevitable ones of foregoing military and/or culture progression for a better production engine, short term vs long term gains and the like. Other than that, the game's straightforward and relatively easy to teach. There's an event to compete for each round, produce stuff based on how you've set your meeples up, pay for more meeples, etc. Standard stuff, but done neatly. There's oodles of cards, and the order in which they come out makes for different strategies and should make for variety from game to game. As long as you play with fast-ish players, and maybe 3 players max, it should feel about the right length (but it has the possibility to drag out otherwise). There's obviously plenty to explore, which is always attractive.

"Streamlined mapless Civ, clearly inspired by TtA."

What I like:
- Shorter than TtA, although perhaps still too long
- Can win without military
- More streamlined than TtA
- The asymmetrical abilities are nice
- Not all the cards are used each game

What I don't like:
- 4p learning game took about 3.5 hrs

I had high hopes for Nations, as a streamlined TtA. It is that, but still felt longer than I had hoped. I hope to play again to see if it goes faster with experience (and fewer players). I love that military is not dominant, although wars can still feel a bit mean. 

There is a lot going on, but I would put the weight a bit lower than the BGG-voted 3.5.

I love this game. Not so great with 5 players though. Really like the feel and way it works. This could become a 10 if I get to play it some more. After a recent play I realise that i think I prefer this with 3, with 4 it takes a good deal longer and the turn order becomes more complicated than clockwise/anticlockwise.

RATING: 5
A brilliant piece of game design that seems to do 95% of what Through the Ages does in a fraction of the time. However, I am rating it a seven because even though it is a brilliant game design, I find it too math-heavy for my taste and it simply takes too long to complete with five players. There are a lot of moving parts and the design is largely successful. However, there are to "gamey" aspects to it. For example, we are building a civilization and yet, hoarding resources and selling them for victory points has nothing to do with the theme and seems to be a shortcut for the designers to better balance the game. 

I would probably rate it an 8 or even a 9 with four or less players (three players may be the sweet spot for this game). With five, it overstays its welcome by a couple of hours.

Update: I lowered it two points because the new version of Through the Ages is deeper and more fun, I believe. In fairness, there is nothing wrong with this game and the time commitment is more reasonable than TTA. It is just that, for me, TTA provides a more compelling narrative and satisfying gaming experience.

So much better than through the ages.  I owned first and second addition of through the ages and sold them both almost immediately.  No one wanted to play them.  Nations offers much faster play time, more streamlined, less fiddly, huge selection of cards, less focus on military.  Way more user-friendly. Didn't have any problem with the quality of the components.  Preferred the smaller cards.  But I did get the game for $60 on sale.

I really enjoy this game, mainly due to the civ-building theme. The various cards present a lot of interesting decisions as you try to maximize them for your current strategy. It is also neat how you can quickly ramp your military up or down as needed for the current situation. Military is important in this game, but you don't use it to directly attack the other players, which is one aspect of other civ-building games that I do not enjoy.

I think three is the sweet spot for number of players, especially if they already know the game. Four is good also but gets a little long. I don't know that I would like to play five...

Two players is enjoyable but is much more confrontational due to the "most / least" criteria on the event cards. It is not one my wife liked a lot.

After first try; a five player game: 

Too much you want to do, not enough actions and a very very very very shortage of resources all the time, and then you have to eat. You can sum that up into one negative word: Agricola. Position makes a lot of difference, even from the start you are way behind as last player since all the good cheap cards are gone. 

Some refer this to "Through the Ages light", Why? This has much more complex mathematics, more parameters and less chanses to correct mistakes. This is a much slower game with less oversight.

I don't really like the art direction and the artwork. It looks like a cheap history book. It actually put me off buying the game for a while. Once you start playing though, that becomes less important.

Gameplay is excellent though, so if you are looking for a good civ game, I'd strongly recommend this.

I bought Nations because of the one player mode, but the rules for that aspect of the game are so poorly laid out that I can't understand how it works (and I am a relatively experienced gamer. The bot tiles are where I get stuck). So that was a big disappointment - I just play 2 player vs myself instead.

Ok so based on this post, designer Rustan H contacted me and directed me to the updated rules on BGG which are somewhat clearer. Still, even with them I had to go to You Tube to find answers to my questions. Now that I have a few proper solo plays under my best,  I can say that this is one of the best solo experiences out there - strategic, different each time, great replay value and you actually feel like you have a purpose.

Later:

Have played this multiplayer now and it is a very strong medium engine builder. Very very good strategy game... however it is possible to have a bad start and be out of the running from quite early on and this is something I see as a bit of a flaw. I know you can avoid using the more advanced cards until you get the hang of the game but where's the fun in that?

Nice Civ-game witch is rightfully compared to TtA.

RATING: 8
Nations is billed as a streamlined Through the Ages, and I think it hits that target pretty well.  At its core it's a card drafting game--the main action is players taking turns buying cards off a central display.  These cards feed into your economy, your military strength, or stability, which allows you to mitigate the negative effects of having a poor military.  There's a way to get extra workers to be able to use your cards more times, but it's really, really expensive.  Managing your economy is a lot simpler than in Through the Ages--the depth the TtA provides in this respect is what makes me think that it's still a better game.  Nations is definitely an enjoyable take on the genre, though.

I'm unsure of how to rate this game. It's like a more tactical version of Through the Ages with a lot more luck thrown in. The game plays quite a bit quicker and there is very little downtime. It's like it stripped away all the rough edges of Through the Ages, but left a soulless husk in it's wake.

I enjoy the game, it's no TtA replacement, but it does work better with 4 and 5 players. I also realize how much I enjoy seeding the event deck in TtA compared to a random flip of a card in Nations.

[b]Update:[/b] Alright, after a few more games and even a solo game, I've come away with a better appreciation for the game. No, it's not a TTA killer. It's almost in the same vein as Eldritch is to Arkham, although not quite as direct. I wish there was an easier way to implement the Advanced/Expert cards. Best solution I've seen so far is to just shuffle them all together, discard anything beyond the basic deck card counts (4 of everything, 8 of the blue ones). Not perfect, but it beats trying to break down, shuffle together the extra cards, and reseed the deck. I have to figure out how to adjust the deck for a 5 player game. Maybe 2 more cards of each type and 4 of the blue?

The rating may rise a point just due to how smooth the solo game played. It felt more like a challenge instead of "score the most points".

Tremendous card drafting game and resource management game. Tough decisions at every corner, indirect conflict and enormous replayability - each game only uses a small portion of the available cards. It even has what is perhaps the best solo variant of a multiplayer game that I know of.

Edit: OK, I finally tried Through the Ages. And I was blown away by it. It replaced Nations as my go-to civ game. But nations is still a fine game, though.

This is a card based Civ game, where you have this player board with a limited number of slots for cards. You buy cards from a main board, and adjust your resource incomes accordingly. You also have a stability stat and a military stat, both of which are used to acquire certain cards or extra abilities. I was initially skeptical I would like this game, since I didn't really connect with Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization and I tent to prefer 'dudes on the map' style civ games. This game reminded me a lot of a heavier Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy which I do like a lot. I've come to understand I really enjoy right resource management games with chartsy personal boards. In particular, I liked how while you were in tight competition with other players, the negative repercussions for losing in a war could be mitigated. The way you can place multiple workers on buildings one per turn at a time was also fantastic as it ads a push your luck element to the areas of tight competition.

Played my second game of Nations last night and from the first/second turn, it was apparent that there was no way of getting back into the game after making a mistake. Aside from the handicap mechanism, there is nothing dynamic in the game that helps a trailing player (such as in The Voyages of Marco Polo, where the dice roll is bad, you get compensation, or in Power Grid, you get first dibs on resources and cities) and for me, it is a broken game.

Most nation-building games are so complicated, it's just solitaire--you have no idea what anybody else is doing because you can barely figure out your own strategy.  Nations is a game where you can and must pay attention to what other players are doing, thanks to wars and competitions for most and least that change each round.  A great, deep game.

RATING: 9
Modified TTA theme with random events every round making the gameplay a little more dynamic and forcing players to adjust to events and other players' actions. Gameplay is a little more forgiving and the theme is strong, though not as good as well integrated as TTA (e.g. use of VP tokens instead of culture track)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I see why it is compared to Through The Ages, so many similar elements. The single action at a time makes the game flow better, and reduces down time.
 
The game ends up to be more tactical is seems you are optimizing the current round instead of building for future rounds. I suppose that comes from the heavy purchase cost of users, building replace the current wiping out all previous accumulated growth, and having to watch out for the current event.  

Still prefer Through the Ages, it seems to be more strategic. However it is longer.

This is a great empire building game.  The rules are well written, easy to understand and teach.  Often these types of games have complex rules that keep you from going back to them as you have to read the rules over again.  I don't see that issue here.  The game had great historical flavor and I really felt like I was building my civilization.  With a lot of cards and the different cards in every game there is a lot of re-playability.  The one tough thing is that it is an unforgiving game.  If you get off to a bad start and do not get the game turned around quickly then you may be in for a long game knowing you cant win.  I am looking forward to playing this game a lot.

Röviden: Túlzó és botor dolog a TTA-hoz hasonlítani, mert bár van közös vonal, de teljesen más mechanikákkal tarkított és más élményt nyújtó játék.

Nagyon jó játék, bár egy kicsit ormótlan és nagyon túlzóak a méretei. Kisebb kiadásban elegánsabb lett volna.(Lehet nem lehetne akkor aranyáron mérni?):)

Még várom a TTA trónfosztóját!

Excellent civilization game.  This game is very similar to "Through the Ages" in that it has leaders, buildings, wonders, cultures, war, etc.  However this game is much cleaner in my opinion.  It removes all the moving of chits back and forth and simplifies warfare greatly.  Is not a short game but plays faster and has less of a learning curve without losing depth.

One of my top ten games. To be clear you shouldnt go NEAR this game with 5 players. I am hesitant and have turned down games at 4 player. I will always play with 3 or less.

Its really hard for me to put my finger on just what I love about this game. I really enjoy how cards you purchase and workers you deploy immediately affect your markers on the game board. I like the feeling of balancing everything and reacting to what other players do. I am also a sucker for a civ theme even if its light. I just think the game is really well designed its smooth and everything makes sense. But if anyone asks you to play always ask how many players first!

RATING: 7
After my first play I didn't love the game. The artwork is a major turnoff. The game is pretty good, and has a steep learning curve. For my first play, I really had no idea what I needed to be doing. This one could probably go up to about a 7.5 if I got a little better at the game. But I still don't think it would ever be one that I absolutely love. I just don't see myself playing this one over about 30 other games in my collection, ever; so I will not be getting it. This one might suit your fancy though. Give it a try.

It has been a while since a game has captivated our  group like Nations.

For me, it seems to do a lot of what Through the Ages does in a more streamlined fashion and in less time. 

There are a lot of possibilities and I've seen players who were trounced in the early stages able to make a ferocious comeback. 

There are some negatives here ( randomness/evil event cards!) but the positives far outwiegh them IMHO..

I don't see this game going away any time soon..

After averaging a game every 18 months or so, gave it one last chance - a three player with all three players who knew the rules. Really enjoyed it! Took under two hours and a very close game. Surprised about how clean the system is - unusual for the overwrought civilization building genre. I sold Through the Ages, and haven't regretted it, but I think I'll keep this one - even if my wife has continually shut it down. Even if gets 1 or 2 games a year, I'll be happy.

A tense and tightly balanced game of war, stability, and resource management. I love the variety of cards available for purchase and the tough decisions involved in choosing when to spend a bit extra to ensure another player doesn't get what they want. This game has perhaps the best implementation of military strength I've ever seen. Cutthroat and engaging, yet strategically subtle. Overall, Nations became an instant favorite, and is a permanent staple in my collection.

Essen 2013 buy. After playing 2 solo games and 2 two-player games, I rather like this game. It is quite coherent and has a good, limited set of rules (easily summarized).

I had modest expectations, having strongly disliked Through the Ages. But this is an excellent civ-building game, with tension, variability, broad strategic horizons.

The five civilizations feel distinct. The card array presents extremely difficult choices, and the opportunity to build distinctive civilizations and pursue a variety of approaches of victory. It's a long game, but with only one action per player at a time, it clicks along nicely.

It may have a runaway leader problem. Or rather, early mistakes can be crippling. But I don't know what a catch-up mechanism would be welcome here. The heart of the gameplay is the tension of keeping your civilization afloat in the early ages, and pursuing a coherent strategy in the later ages. And there is genuine interaction here; if you fail to track you opponents' needs and goals, you'll be at a handicap.

I've played with 3, 4, and 5, and each works fine, though five will obviously run longer. The variety of cards offers tremendous replayability. Oh, and the production values are fine - I have no idea what people complaining about.

Having a blast with friends who are reluctant to play because of too many pieces. The game is easy to understand even for newcomers, clear and distinguishable graphic helps a lot. With throat-cutting decision, we turned against each other multiple times. The vast amount of progress cards add variety to the game but I wish for more choices of Nation to choose from. The real history card really make the game interesting for a few rounds. The game feel balance and you will always have a chance to comeback one way or another at a turn of age or good timing events, as long as you can come up with elaborate plan that is. Now everyone want to play more of it.

Even at the basic level (A Boards, Basic Cards), players will spend the first game studying the cards not knowing what might be coming up.  This can leave players feeling less in control of the game and more subject to the vagaries of the card tableau.  I expect (much like 7 Wonders, Peloponnes, and other nation building games) that familiarity will bring with it a better appreciation of the game flow and how to manage it.

I do like the individual player adjustment level as a method of balancing the game between experienced and beginning players, but the experienced player will have the card knowledge advantage.

The 40 minutes / player is a good estimate and the game is rather simplistic as far as game mechanisms go (buy a card or place a worker or place an architect), so the challenge is managing the resources and the potential against future cards/events.

Less intermeshed systems than Through the Ages, but might be the game to get for the quicker experience of such a game.

Sorry, But I feel  	
Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization feels much more like I'm building a Nation. This game feels like I'm just buying  what it takes to avoid the event that will happen, or the wars that people take. The technologies just come and go to fast in this game, to mean much. TTA, at least when you develop a technology you have it the entire game. Not just till you need that spot for a different tech.

Only played solo so far, but I enjoyed it so much I played 3 games in one day.  Really looking forward to trying it multiplayer.  This is such as massive improvement over Through the Ages for me, which to be honest I never liked - fast turns, no fiddly counters to count actions or track lots of stuff on player mats, less in-your-face military competition.  Trying all the B sides a la 7 Wonders gives some nice replayability.

I highly prefer this over Through the Ages, mainly due to the fact that the wars in this game are "1 player versus everyone" rather than "1 vs 1." The fact that a single card can basically take a player out of the game in TtA makes it very unattractive to our table.

I think it's best with three players regarding the relatively long playing time. Also recommended is to use the B sides of the player boards (variable starting "abilities") and all the cards (don't leave out some).

One could be tempted to call this Through the Ages Lite, but really it´s so much more.  The event cards give you a lesson in History, a factor which is so superficial in TTA.  

Amazing game though it lacks quite a bit of player interaction.

Has improved with further play. Over a dozen games now and not getting tired of it. I do prefer Civ Through the Ages over this, but this is a friendlier version of that and more requested by others. I'm not sold on the final age and the often pointless leaders, events, etc.

The Finnish version of Civilization: Through The Ages. Certainly it's a less mean game than Civilization: Through The Ages. Military takes more of a back seat, although it's still very much important (it determines turn order after all), it's less crippling to those on the wrong side of the sword point. Who's the target audience of this game? It seems to be reaching out for the same gaming audience that plays Civilization: Through The Ages. So were they specifically targeting gamers who found Civilization: Through The Ages a bit not to their liking for one reason or another, and those that like Civilization: Through The Ages so much that they'd be interested in playing a refined version of said game? (Either way, I think they've succeeded.) The two games are so mind glowingly similar and yet so different. From the colours of the cards, wonder steps and costs, the selection mechanic and multiple other similarities. And yet, this is a refined version of Civilization: Through The Ages and there are so many tweaks that the games feel the same, but also don't feel the same. It's weird. I can't judge how easy everything being familiar made it to learn, but it was extremely easy to pick up and launch into.

Although they've made it less fiddly, there's still an awful lot of counting. There's the familiar military level, maintaining workers (but not with happiness), and production counting. These are all things that become second nature to an experienced Civilization: Through The Ages player and so it's the same with Nations.

The number one improvement Nations has over Civilization: Through The Ages is keeping the pace up by having each player perform one action then onto the next player, instead of all their actions in a go. They've limited the number of colonies, wonders, resources type you can have. They've made it less war like by limiting it to one war that affects everyone (or possibly no one), building a way to lessen the impact of war and overall making it less crushing while still keeping the importance of the military level for turn order, events and conflicts multipliers. There's so many cards that aren't going to be seen by players from game to game that it'll definitely be less open to expert player planning than Civilization: Through The Ages. In this respect the game is better with more players because you see more cards from the decks. There's no secret cards, but that's mitigated by the uncertainty of what cards will appear from game to game. So there's no scoring cards you've discarded that you're opponents don't know about. All this makes the game a very different beast. Perhaps less tense. To an extent it feels like you're playing more against the game than against the other players, especially when you play at the highest difficulty level - all the more so than when compared against that Czech game. After six games I've come tot he realisation that players probably have a better time at the easier levels because they can do more stuff. 

In it's own right it's a great game. A lot of stuff has been retained from Civilization: Through The Ages, some thrown out and new elements introduced. It's much easier to bring to the table for beginners because the pace of the game has been improved. For lovers of Civilization: Through The Ages players it's probably not going to take the place of that game, but there might be room for both in the collection due to Nations being a bit more accessible to a wider audience. (Indeed the box is so big my Civilization: Through The Ages box now resides inside my Nations box.) Pity the box is double the size it needs to be. The rules are well done and the game is easy to pick up. I'll forgive them the thin boards if it means (like Castles of Burgundy), that we see some expansion nation boards sometime in the future. It's the sort of Civ game I was bound to like and I'm glad they've openly borrowed and refined a fine game into something more accessible.

One play in, I'm not sure if I enjoyed myself.  It is a very well designed game as far as I can tell.  But going in I was hoping for a n epic civ experience, but I felt like I was just working to min/max a spreadsheet of some sorts.  I never felt the exhilaration of building an empire or really noticed the escalation of getting better buildings.  Yeah, as the ages went on more powerful buildings came out, but I never felt like I was upgrading my civilization.  Hard to explain really, but my nose was so into the numbers of everything that there was literally no theme. All themes are abstracted to some extent, but this was excessively so.  I will play it again, and perhaps the theme will come out more when I have more experience with the mechanics, but I'm not holding my breat.  Ultimately, a good game, but not what I'm looking for in this genre.

RATING: 9
A solid card driven civ game with interesting choices and great flow. The design is an obvious (but significant) variant on the excellent Through the Ages. Plays faster than Through the Ages with less downtime, but ultimately I prefer TtA for its greater depth. On the other hand, Nations is less intimidating than TtA and hits the table much more often.

RATING: 9
Before Nations, my only real experience with a civ game happened 3 months prior with Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game and I didn't especially like it. But I like Nations. A lot.

When I first read the rules to Nations, I thought that this might be a solid 7 or 8. Then after our first 2-player game, it felt like a high 7, but probably not an 8. Then we played a second time, and I thought this might be an 8, actually. And then after our third play yesterday, I'm thinking it might be a 9.

I'm not sure if Nations is actually a civ game. There's not map to expand. The military is very indirect. There's quite a bit of tactical decision to make based on the cards that appear, which don't always fit logically together. But this is all why I probably like it a lot. The worker placement is really well-done. And the economics/resource management is exactly what I like.

Because there's such a slow build at the beginning, and by the end you feel like your nation is just starting to become powerful and productive, you don't want the game to end. I can tell there's still a lot of plays left in this one for me.

This is an interesting civ game, although I miss the greater feeling of technological paths found in other titles like Through the Ages. It feels more like I'm tearing down all of my old infrastructure and building new, better infrastructure than like I'm upgrading in Nations. 

The game largely revolves around jockeying for position for the events, for book scoring, for military/stability for wars and player order, and for progress cards. It's a very tactical game, and you'll need to adjust on the fly to what comes up.

Había leído de Nations que era un TtA simplificado y más accesible, y con esa idea me acerqué a él. Me encontré un gran juego, con sensación de desarrollo, rejugabilidad y tensión, bastante dinámico de jugar por la mecánica de una acción por jugador, pero con una exigencia bastante similar a la de mi querido TtA. Se trata de un eurogame duro, largo y propenso al AP y que, al igual que ocurría en TtA, no perdona errores y uno de ellos te puede dejar fera de la partida muy pronto.

Wow.  I haven't been this impressed with a game for a while.  Elegant, well-designed, and important tactical decisions at every turn.  Iconography is clean and easy to understand.  I know supporters of Through the Ages are madly in love with that game, but I think this game delivers a similar experience with what looks like a WHOLE LOT LESS work.  This is exactly the kind of experience that I am looking for from a Civ-builder.  Top-notch.  Everything is implemented well and I look forward to future offerings from this designer.

Played this again and I have to say that it really scratches my civ-building itch in just the right way.  Has all of the elements you could want in a manageable game time.  Easily in my top 10.

The combination of ease of play and depth of payoff grants this game a 10 for me.  I love the replayability and the fact that you have so much great card interaction means that this game will get a lot of plays before you see the same cards/combos twice.  Tremendous game that I'll play at any time.

Very good civilization building game.  However, in our first and only game played so far, I was the first player starting out and was able to get the first and only military card in round 1.  As such, I was always able to stay ahead of my wife in military and usually was the starting player as a result.  We felt that in this case I had a huge advantage.  However, since there is some luck involved with which cards happen to come out on the board, that's bound to happen on occasion.  Otherwise, we did like this game a lot and look forward to playing it more.

RATING: 7
After 2 plays: Clearly inspired by Through the Ages. I like how the different kinds of resources are more balanced and have greater variety. The major difference is that unlike TtA's monolithic player turns, here you take turns doing one action at a time until everyone passes. In some ways this is better, but you also get more AP if everyone has to re-evaluate the board state with every action. TtA does theme for war-related things better. Hoping I can play this some more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Preliminary rating after one play, ratings may go up/down by 0.5.  This is a well designed game, far easier to teach than Through the Ages but definitely not as good as TTA.  Even though there is no direct conflict it seems that having a strong army is still critically important as it helps for wars and colonies as well as many events. 

The random events work pretty well but since there is no way to plan for what events may show up in future rounds they may heavily favor some players over other players.  

Going first vs. second can easily win the game for a player due to being able to pick up choice colonies, leaders, or wonders.  Sometimes there are multiple good cards, other times there are not.

Overall a fun game but lacking the strategic depth that you get from TTA.  That doesn't mean it isn't a great game though as 'not as good as TTA' can still be really good.

[1 play] This game feels like a mix of a St Petersburg style card purchase mechanic, Puerto Rico style building activations, with a La Citta style event mitigation. You create an economic engine that slowly grows and transitions  into eventual victory points.

I want to play it again to see if I can do better the second time. But I do recognize that this type of thinky "Spreadsheet" style game doesn't play to my strengths as much as games that require faster analysis of rapidly changing opportunities and valuations involving auctions or worker placement and anticipating the psychology of opponents moves. I enjoy the challenge regardless though.

I'm not a fan of warring in a game, but it doesn't bother me in this one because war is used as a peripheral activity, not a DEFINING activity. 

The game moves along at a good clip, too, even when playing with AP prone people, and the diversity and number of cards available for each age means no two games will ever play alike. 

Really glad we bought this one, as we don't own any other games like it.

This game is quite unthematic, especially the buildings feel very abstracted, even the event cards are quite uninspired. Well, I could live with that, but in my opinion this game includes a major design flaw:

In the last round(s) of a game, everybody is concerned about reorganizing their workers to maximize their score. You are really just spending money to take a worker from one card and place it on another card. I find this entirely anticlimactic and unsatisfying. So much so that I finally sold this game.

Sajnos már rég játszottam a nagy előd TTA-val, így nem igazán hasonlítanám őket. Egy nagyon jó civilizációs játékot ismertem meg a Nationsben, amiben minden nyersanyagunkra figyelnünk kell. Kártyák segítségével fejlesztjük a népünket. A kártyákat megvesszük, majd emberinkkel használjuk őket. A játékban nagyon dinamikusan tudunk a meglévő kártyák erejével játszani és egy adott percben leverhetetlen seregből egy pillanat alatt békés gabona termelő népet alkotni. Jól eltaláltak a kártyák, kiegyenlítettnek éreztem őket. Jól eltalált az új emberek játékba hozása, nagyon nehéz döntés.
A játék hibájaként két dolgot lehet említeni. Egyrészt nem toleráns a lemaradókkal, de úgy érzem egy játék után mindenki érezni fogja, hogyan játssza a következőt. Illetve a másik dolog a hosszú játékidő. Ez a komolyabb gond, mert fele idő alatt is lejátszható egy komoly másik jó játék is és akkor már az ember meggondolja elővegye-e. Ezektől függetlenül nekem nagyon tetszett a Nations, szívesen játszok vele máskor is.

[2014-08-23]
Pozitívum, hogy nagyon jól működik ketten is, egyes kártyák így erősebbek, mások gyengébbek lehetnek, de a játékmenet ugyanolyan élvezetes. Viszont ketten a szerencse szerepe nagyobb, ami kicsit érdekessé teszi ezt a komoly játékot. A rengeteg kártyából kevesebb jön fel így sokkal nagyobb valószínűséggel fordulhatnak elő olyan körök, amikben egy-egy fajta kártyából nincs vagy csak nagyon kevés van, így adott stratégiák könnyebben befürödhetnek. Ettől függetlenül továbbra is nagyon tetszik.

Amazing civ game ... So much more straightforward than Through the Ages yet retains the incredibly difficult trade-off decisions on how to best utilize your meeple every turn.

This game, like TTA, does require some Military presence - perhaps even more so as their are other ways to mitigate lack of military in TTA whereas in Nations the Military track is also used for other key things - like turn order, event bonuses and end-game scoring

The tactical brother to the more strategic Through the Ages. I love tactical games, so this is my favorite of the two.

Plays best with 3-4 players. 5 is a bit too long and I fear that books are too important in a 5 player game. Books give you VP's for every player that is below you on the point track, giving 4 points for the player in the lead. It feels a bit to overpowered. Yes everyone is aware of this and everyone can go after books, but the tactical nature of the game makes it likely that there are ony a few buildings etc that give you any book-income.

While it's certainly not a bad game, and in the one game I played, I came in second, it's yet another game of optimizing resources and card purchases. The events, resources, advisors and other building cards are very thematic, but often times make no sense (why is Persia building Stonehenge?) I have other games that do this (Castles of Burgundy for example) that don't take 3 hours to play.

Edit: I like this one a little more in comparison to Through The Ages. I got trounced in a 2p game, but I'm willing to play it again.

Civ type game, made in the image of the Civ computer games. 1-5 players, so can solo. Played the once, took 3.5 hours. Good game, all card based, but I lost heavily, and kinda got trapped, as there is a competitive edge to each round, so once I was behind, could not recover. This made the game a bit frustrating for me, but not sure if this is an issue which often happens. A lot of thinking goes into tactics, which is why it took a long time, but think this would be substantially reduced on a 2nd play

A solid civilization game. There is definitely a quality interactive component to have a strong enough military to be more powerful than your opponents, not only for turn order, but also for the end of round bonuses. You definitely are managing your kingdom and carefully have to select how to replace your buildings, as well as which wonders to build. I enjoy the multiple paths to victory, too. I think I like it a little more than Through the Ages, as it is streamlined and less fiddle.

Just one play so far, with 3 players. As we were all experienced with Through the Ages, we jumped right into the expert game and did well, at least relative to each other. We pursued very different strategic paths, but the final scores ended up 27-28-29. I was impressed by how close it was. Nations has made a solid first impression on me!

Perfect game to scratch the civ-building itch in a reasonable time or to introduce new players to the genre. There is a lot of replayability since a small selection of cards is used in each game and the players have to constantly adapt their plans to the available cards. 

The gameplay is worth a 10 for me, but the artwork is less inspiring than other titles in the same genre.

I love civ games! It started with Sid Meier's Civ II way back in the '90s, but I've since tried many board game versions. [thing=71][/thing], the few times I've played it, has been a blast -- but it sure is long! I didn't enjoy [thing=77130][/thing] very much: seemed as if your game play was dictated too much by your starting civ, and I didn't like the totally random board layout? [thing=40765][/thing] was better, but I didn't like the random objective cards and totally random events. My favorite has been [thing=25613][/thing], nearly perfect except for having to spend so much effort keeping up militarily (and the fact that I am such a bad player, despite having played nearly 200 games!). 

The game rules are quite straightforward. It feels much like Through the Ages, but plays faster and with less emphasis on military strength. It is a lighter game, though: you won't see all the cards and there's a less predictable progression so you can't make definite plans; you must react to the game situation turn by turn, much more so than in TTA. At this point I still prefer TTA, but would be happy to play this again -- especially if time is limited! It seems to be an excellent lighter civ game!

This game feels like the next step for gamers from 7 Wonders.  It is a civilization building game of sorts but everything is represented with cards.  Each turn players take cards of different types in turn order from a grid, these cards depict historical people, constructions (called Wonders), military units, buildings, and wars throughout history.  These cards are added to your tableau where they produce resources each turn.  Just describing it this way you should see the similarities to 7 Wonders.  This game takes it a step further though for those of us that want a deeper game than that very friendly gateway.

Past the 7 Wonders-esque tableau building this game becomes mean.  Players need to actually deploy workers to their cards to use many of them.  Deploying workers and building Wonders costs resources.  These resources need to be managed because every turn events happen that cost these resources and many hurt the player(s) with the least.  Many of the cards are also lost, or at the very least their effects are, if you fall behind in a certain resource.  Players can start wars where more is lost if you don't at least match their military prowess.

You certainly need a high resolve to play this game because there is a decent amount of player interaction and your opponents will come after you and it is going to hurt.  On top of which, the game is a decent length.  The rulebook says 40 minutes per player and I think that hits the nail right on the head.  I should mention though that I think the player count should stay at 3-4.  Playing with 5 the rules adjust and negative events hit more people and it makes it even more hopeless, especially for newer players.  Head-to-head and positive/negative events are usually going to split so early mistakes could become exacerbated without the ability to overcome them.

I gotta say, I really like this game.  It is certainly less fiddly than other civ builder games and plays a lot faster (not to mention sets up and breaks down a hell of a lot faster).  Plus with everything being diluted to a card-driven system while strategies are hard to come by without a few plays under your belt it is mechanically simpler than other civ builders as well.  My issue in the past with civ builders is that they feel very similar to computer civ builders and I'd much rather play a computer game without all the fiddliness and set-up/clean-up.  This game has that flavor but gives a little bit different of a feel that makes me want to play it and I don't have to spend so much time on overhead.  Also, the game has a decent amount of variety with hundreds of cards which should keep it fresh across multiple plays.  I also like the integrated difficulty mechanic that allows stronger players to play with a handicap against weaker players.

I almost hate that I like it so much because the learning curve is Everest steep and it is a mean and decently long game.  It is very hard to get people to finish (let alone play again) a game that beats them up and takes a while to do it.  Which is a weird catch-22 because the only way to figure out this game is to give it a couple plays.

It's very complicated to review a game that happens to be a copy of a different one. So, like everybody was saying, Nations is like Through the Ages. I knew that when first started to play it but, what I didn't know was that Nations is REALLY like Through the Ages. I like TTA. Nations is the same(ish).

The worker placement style and the much more quicker turns makes it better than its predecessor, IMO. A small but very relevant improvement.

I can see myself playing Nations much more often than TTA and I would consider it a good addition to my game collection, mainly because it solves the 'fast paced civ game' problem we, gamers, are living from a long time now.

TTA inspired card game? Yes purlease...

And after half a game it does feel like a TTA tribute band. In a good way. Less fiddly, wars handled well. Similar decision making to TTA, less Computer Civ. inspired but smooth game play with little downtime. Want to explore a lot more. For experienced gamers or TTA lovers go straight to the advanced deck.

3 games in.

Main difference to TTA is that not all cards will come out. Which makes it a more tactical game and in some ways more enjoyable because you don't know exactly how history will unfold. It does NOT though seem to create a strategic arc - the points at the end are incremental not exponential as per TTA. This can be both a good and a bad thing. Not keen on artwork - however everything is functional.

The effects of war can be motivated by stability (apart from vp) or by a weak country taking a war. This is both elegant and so show unsatisfactory compared to TTA where the threat of war was a powerful effect on players decisions, here it's more of a euro nerf. Going 1st is worth having though as is the event bonus.

In last age there was a sense of just buying buildings and shuffling around workers for more VP - this might be inexperience with Nations but it felt a bit gamey.

Overall a good 1st design effort but if you are going to step in to the ring with the heavy weight champion of Civ then a few knocks have to expected.

5th  play

I'd rather play TTA - this is too long for a lighter game and the ages arc is not very interesting (actually its not really there_- just 8 similar rounds. There might be a lot of cards but they are not very different from each other so the thrill of the draft is lost. I would love to see Vlaada tackle Civ again.

6th play

Not unpleasant to play. However v tactical and no arc. Nothing wrong per se but but being so close to TTA give me TTA

7th

---------------------------------

And Vivienne Raper has written a perfect description of Nations vis a vis TTA

'How much do you enjoy civilisation games versus resource management euros? 

..... Nations feels (to me) more like Russian Railroads than Civilisation on the PC. TTA is Civilisation for board gamers without the map.

TTA, because every card comes out during the game, can afford to have very distinctive, rich and unusual cards. More like the card richness in Innovation, but with a lot more strategy, less take-that, etc. than in that game. Because different cards come up in every game of Nations, most cards have to simply produce something. Otherwise, you'd need lots of take-that (as with Innovation) to stop a runaway leader if someone drew a particularly good card.

For this reason, Nations felt - to me - much more like building an economic engine than building a civilisation. TTA has the same economic engine buzzing away underneath, but it lots more other cool civ stuff going on as well. To me, that felt like 'building a civilisation' and not 'generating victory points'. Depending how much you like raw economic engine games, your mileage with Nations will differ.'

-------------------------

and am done with Nations.

Has serious balance issues. Feels like if you aren't in the top half in the running, that the game is over in the second age. Very tactical game where you have to look at the situation at hand and make spot decisions. Long term strategy is pretty much toast if the mix of cards that are flopped don't suit that strategy.

Initial rating 7.

I had hopes for this one but unfortunately didn't meet my expectations. It is an interesting civ game but i found it flawed in several aspects that made me not wanting to play it anymore.

- A common tactic i disliked was the "tactical pass": Just do a cheap action and wait until others pass so you can reassign workers (military, stability) to harm others and/or gain the event bonuses

- The uncertainty that a type of card will appear during an age is something i found irritating and random.
It wasn't too uncommon that only 1 military card appeared during a new age which led to a position others couldn't respond. 
The problem was worse if your strategy involves some future cards that never appear. For example a civilization or leader that benefits from golden age cards and only very few appear.

12/3/2015: Dropped rating to 6. I don't feel like playing this any time soon.

They took an outstanding game (Through the Ages), stripped away most of the good parts, and gave it almost nothing in return. You should think that simplifying the game to its death would at least result in a shorter game, but that is not the case. So only an Ok game, not buying this.

Intresting mechanics and a overall a solid game I think, but I never felt like I was building a civilization, just buying new cards to max the point evey round.

If you're head over heels in love with Through the Ages, then this might admittedly feel like a let-down. Don't let me try to convince you otherwise.

But if, like me, you found that game painful and sloggy (but, like me, you really WANTED to love it) then I think Nations might be the game for you. It sands off all the rough, pointy edges of TtA and leaves you with one highly polished billiard ball of a game.

Only issue is its length. The game is not dynamic enough to keep me totally compelled throughout. It's a bit spreadsheety and I'm usually ready for it to be over by the 3/4 mark. Still, if that's not a turn off, by all means, get this game.

A really go rendtion of Through the ages or Glory to Rome without the fiddlness and it solves the military issue of the rich get richer.  The game does have an AP problem but if you set up a verbal caller to speed the game along.  First era took 1.5 hours and the second era only took 15 minutes.  The game has a great mechanic about a gameing handicap.  If a player is much more exprienced then he gets less resources each round.  I will be putting that idea in every game I create from now on.

First session (5-players, partial learning game) went just so-so. Second session (3-players, full game) went much better. Two 4-player games after that, even better.

Art and components are only just average at best (the game is overpriced), but this is a fairly straightforward design (which is Military heavy)/

I love the history behind the cards, which the designers for the most part do a very good job matching cost and effect.  

In comparison to Through the Ages, I see the need for Nations because of the (much) shorter playing time, but in reality there is no comparison (TtA is the much better game).

enjoyable but need to pay attention to the event cards and effect on military and stability with culture giving you the cushion (as well as points each round). 1st play was 5 player with 4 being new players and felt overlong though engrossing throughout. Hopefully will play quicker but there will always be an element of AP due to the randomness and availability of cards at start of the round.

RATING: 7.75
Very fun and streamlined Civ building game. Very enjoyable although I have a few major issues with it. There is a large over emphasis on military as it gets you nearly every other resource in the game. Battles essentially let you convert gold into other resources, colonies give you free goods, wars make enemies spend valuable resources (either to catch up in military, to take the war before you, or to build up large amounts of Stability), the numerous military related events, and the fact military determines turn order.

It felt like you *must* have a strong military to do well in this game. If the event cards don't heavily favor military and have many "lowest stability goes last" it seems to help balance it out, but it still seems overly strong.

Not sure on a "fix" to it, but maybe have military + stability determine turn order? Still fun and I want to play it again a few times.

Plus, I wish the game went into the modern era or even early future, but was kind of long enough as it was. This is kind of just a minor nitpick though.

UPDATE: The problems I feared are a lot worse than I first thought. Military is so dominantly strong and lopsided that it makes the game less enjoyable. Additionally, you really need to come up with some system for balancing the cards if you're using Advanced and Expert. Something like base cards + X amount of others and also discarding some cards if you don't meet a certain number of each type. Hope the designers can come up with a fix and official rules for this!

Talk about a brain burner! Every round is a challenging puzzle to solve, use your resources and workers efficiently to compete for objectives each round. These objectives have consequences (bo.

But in the end it is well balanced and leaves players with a feeling of accomplishment. Bottom line - challenging and rewarding.

A great feature of the game is the ability for players to play on different difficulty levels in the same game. Veteran players can play on a harder difficulty while new player can have a more gentle experience.

Lacked elegance in my opinion.  Was pretty clunky and fairly random.  I wish that the cards had a distribution when being placed rather than randomly assorted and fluctuating the economy greatly.  Also, I felt like every card was duplicated, the battles and resource cards (yellows) are redundant and so are the leaders and colonies.  What do each of those provide that the other could not?  It added a layer to the game that felt unnecessary to me, and was thrown in there for theme.  It made the game tighter than it needed to me, for my taste.  I can appreciate the worker placement parts of the game, I felt like being able to long-term plan and not moving your workers was solid.  And the progression of the cards also made sense.

Commendable civilisation card/worker-placement game. Players are required to purchase cards that bestow certain benefits on their owners, such as increasing their production capacity for certain resources, progressing them along the game's various tracks e.g. military strength or national stability, the ability to start a war, construct a wonder, acquire an advisor etc. Most of the cards need to be activated in order to be useful and this is where the worker placement element comes into play, requiring a balance of knowing when to deploy extra workers thereby increasing production but also introducing added demands to the nation. 'Nations' is an extremely accomplished game, reminiscent of 'Saint Petersburg' in its card-drafting mechanism, but with a lot more depth to what you can do with your cards once you've acquired them. There's a hint of the rich get richer here and players can easily get left behind, especially if they get on the wrong end of a few wars, but the multiple paths to victory make this a highly recommended civilisation game.

It does have the buzz, but it is not a grand epic civ game. It is a Euro with a pasted on civ-theme.

It is a decent Euro, placing your workers to gather better placement options, with some timed requirements (the event cards) mixed in. Player interaction is very limited (only wars and maybe some as of yet unseen other event cards) and therefore it plays like any other well designed Euro. Which I have enough of already. 

Would not mind owning it, but I'm not looking for it either.

[edit] Played Through The Ages (TTA) yesterday again, and Nations is clearly almost a 1-1 copy of that game. So why do I like TTA very much while I'm left quite cold at this one? Been thinking about it and the big clincher is that in TTA, you can upgrade your workers to better versions, while in Nations, you simpy remove their old job and get something else instead. There is no 'upgrading', just 'tactical placement'. And by removing this mechanism, the game went from strategic to tactic. Which is fine for a Euro-game, but not for a civ game. That should the epitome of strategic play.

First game in three was very good. It seems to play a lighter vesion of Through the Ages. There is a lot of random with so many different cards that the game strategy could be forced to switch in tactic. Moreover giving the first player to the strongest army could be dangerous if no more army cards will be discovered.
Second game still in three player and was fun.
Looking for play more and in more.

I don't get to play too many civ games. Mostly because they take very long. But also because most of them include direct player to player combat, which I don't enjoy. [thing=25613][/thing] is a solid design which I enjoy, but I feel is too fiddly and long to be as enjoyable as I want it to be.
And then Nations comes along. It does away with the direct player combat. It does away with all the fiddlyness with a surprisingly simple and straight forward set of rules, yet it keeps the depth and emotional involvement of Through the Ages. In fact, I'd say it is everything I like about Through the Ages and nothing I don't like about that game.
Now, one game isn't enough to be sure, but this felt like a real winner. And thanks to the shorter playing time, I can see this hitting the table on a more regular basis, not just when we plan weeks ahead.

Initial rating: 8 - I'm quite certain this will rise with more plays.

Hmm. We played one short game and one full game. In the first game, 2 players made mistakes that took them out of contention. In the full game (straight after and now with some experience) 1 player fell into a negative feedback loop and so was constantly losing points and resources. This left him without enough stuff to do everything he needed in future turns and so kept losing everything. That really isn't fun for that player and knowing you've lost with 2+ hours to go isn't fun at all.

Beyond that, the cards that come out are massively swingy. Military should determine turn order, but we had three cards in a row which negated that. Losing out on an early war seems to basically cripple you for the game. Not my cup of tea. Oh, and I won the long game so it's not that I'm a sore loser. It's just that I never felt like I was actually having fun with any part of the game.

Only 1/3 cards comes into play. This is to random, especially with the military cards. When there is only one military card, the player who leads in military could take this card and safe his first place in player order and become something from the event. The other players lose something from the event. We have this in the first 2 rounds. Military os also important for colonies and wars. Maybe military is to important?

You can plan nothing. You must adjust to the event and there are so much new cards (minimum 10 every round).

Every good thing in this game was in Through the Ages. Why play Nations when you have TtA?

One cannot play this without making comparisons to Through the Ages ... they are that similar. And given that Through the Ages has set a high bar by long being ensconced in the top 10 games on the BGG leaderboard, Nations had better have some nice things going for it to compare favorably. Fortunately, it does, especially in the area of streamlining away some of the fiddly aspects of Through the Ages. The game is pretty challenging, and achieving a balance of resources can be tough. It's ultimately not as complex and deep as Through the Ages, but I think that was the goal ... Nations gives the same epic feel of nation-building through card drafting with a slightly more tuned game engine. It won't replace Through the Ages on my game shelf, but I'm looking forward to playing this many more times!

Bought and played with wife and daughter.  They actually really liked it.  We did, however, play with a couple "beginner" rules.  No War was declared and we knew the Event prior to selecting our goods at beginning of round.  We also didn't play with the Expert cards.  Next time, however...

This game is obviously heavily inspired by Through the Ages.  Nations modernizes its older brother to some degree by streamlining some processes, shortening the play time, and the use of tokens instead of sliding markers up and down tracks is an improvement.  They're pretty much even in terms of strategic and tactical decisions.

But I prefer Through the Ages, despite the fact that there are more hurdles to playing it.  I think it does a better job of capturing the civilization theme, it's more interactive and geared towards aggression, there's more opportunity for ebb and flow because players get so many more actions over the course of the game, and, frankly, Nations is quite derivative and I tend to give more respect to a wholly inventive design.

RATING: 8
Exceptionally well as a resource management game, not particularly exceptional in terms of being a civ-building game (totally neglecting technologies in terms of unique game-changing mechanics and in parts rather odd resource combinations of the buildings make for that). The civ-building part is [-]rather abstract[/-]. When coming to think of it, this game is completely devoid of civ-building. Nevertheless the game feels fresh and comes with a ton of great ideas, some subtle,some others less subtle but very direct. The wars for example are a great way of directly influencing your opponents next move(s),with the opponents still having lots of options at hand(thus eliminating a scripted game walkthrough). Increasing your military strength will leave your opponents with the choice to either:
- Buy wars and thus be spared from negative effects at the cost of other options or
- try to increase your military strength if available
- Try to increase your stability to neglect the effects of wars to a certain degree
- neglect the threats of war and hope the damage done won't be as decisive as the benefit you gained from the alternative.

There's so much more in this box (like the integrated handicap variant - brilliant touch), but after just one game I can't quite put my finger on it. I just know that I was amazed during several moments over the course of the game by just how game elements are connected. This is a great game that deserves coming back to.In terms of civilization-building it's nowhere close to recent Sid Meier' Civ, but it's rather in the veins of Through the ages. Over which it clearly wins. Administering your resources is by far less time-consuming than in TtA and thus less dry. And here's my 2 cents on the artwork. Before I had access to the game and looking at the pictures here I thought the artwork sucked. However, in the context of a game in play the artwork is perfectly fine, even some really great winter/autumn sky backgrounds to give you some mood on some cards. With this many distinct cards you can't expect every card to show tons of detail. And in my opinion making a distinct illustration for each and every one of these many cards is going the extra mile.Actually every time I play I come t appreciate the artwork even more.   

In the end it boils down to a very "simple" resource management and combi building/combi management game (every building mixes two different resource types, start-buildings produce a combination of 2 different resources and for each age the buildings produce exactly one more resource, i.e. 3,4,5 or - finally -6 resources in age IV) Despite these very obvious optimization traits, I still like this game. Furthermore I can ignore that this game doesn't deliver on the civ-building aspect. 

However if you're craving for that real civ-building experience, a game where civ-building expresses in more ways than just the name of the cards with some background info, I strongly advise you to go with Sid Meier's Civ or Clash of Cultures. Make this the game of your choice when looking for a great Euro!

Completely replaced Through the Ages. I enjoyed the gameplay of TtA, but the amount of rules and play time were way too much. Nations is only a little shorter, but the rules are vastly superior. All of the complicated, hard-to-remember rules of TtA have now been streamlined in Nations. I watched Rahdo's runthrough, skimmed through the rulebook, and had no issues playing Nations. TtA, on the other hand, I tried to play multiple times and it was always an all-day affair just flipping through the rulebook. We aborted most of our games of TtA because it just took way too long.

The resources in Nations are represented by tokens, so no more having to figure out if the blue cubes represent food or other resources. No more being destroyed by an unexpected military card - nations handles military in a way that is much easier to grasp and more fair to all players. You can even start a war as a defensive move in Nations if you're trailing in military (assuming that your opponent doesn't start a war first, of course).

The only downsides are the insane price and some component issues. There is no reason at all that this game should cost $68, but that is the current price. The components are fairly cheap (thin player boards, cards that feel cheap) and there aren't any more pieces than other games that cost much less, and the publisher isn't some small unknown company. This game should definitely be in the $30-$40 range. I have no idea how they're trying to justify that price.
Also, the cards are all badly cut. There are so many cards that you wouldn't be able to remember which is which based on how they're cut, so this won't affect gameplay, but for $68 I would expect much better quality. The cards also look and feel kind of cheap. I would sleeve them, but considering they don't get held in a player's hand they should hold up okay.

Overall, a great game. I imagine that they'll eventually release a version that fixes the production issues and is a more reasonable price, at which point this game should definitely replace Through the Ages in the rankings.

I've played it once and enjoyed it. I was thinking I might not enjoy myself since I'm a huge fan of Through the Ages. But I found a different kind of enjoyment to it. It's more about the immediate feeling of balancing resources with a combination of buildings that rapidly move through the card row. It's almost as if Through the Ages got busy with Suburbia. 

This is all based on one play. My views may change with more. I just hope I'm able to get more plays in. Unfortunately, I don't think Ash is going to be a fan. Here's to hoping.

::UPDATE:: 2/5/13
I played a second game only a couple weeks after the first. I'm only now getting to updating my thoughts. It's a fun game, but it's nowhere near as good as TtA. In fact, if they didn't come out and blatantly say it, I wouldn't even think that they were shooting for a "quicker TtA". Instead, I would just think they borrowed a couple mechanics from the king of civ-builders (who can blame them). 

The game ends up more of a turn-by-turn tactical struggle, rather than a grand-strategy, building game. And this is where it loses quite few points for me. With a civ-builder, I want to have a heavy dose of multi-turn planning and strategizing. I don't really get it here. Instead, I take a look at the event for this turn, then look at the cards and my current status, and do everything I can to best position myself this turn, without worrying about future rounds. The player that consistently does this best throughout the game will be the winner.

In that regard, I find it to be a completely different game than TtA. The game I prefer to compare it to is [b]Peloponnes[/b]. Peloponnes, like Nations, has events that can do serious damage if you don't prepare for them. It also has that turn-by-turn tactical feel because player get a new tile each round, determined by an auction phase. There are other similarities, but I'll spare them for this arena. Suffice it to say that this game is NOT Through the Ages [i]light[/i]. Nor is it TtA [i]elegant[/i], [i]streamlined[/i], or [i]II[/i]. It's not TtA [i]anything[/i].

I would consider us truely board game geeks...

we have been playing togehter for 15 years+ and we just LOVE this game...
the variability, the deepnes of each and every game surprises us again and again...

we have payed this game probably more than a 100 times... but it is nearly as fun to play as the first time....

althout we added a few minor alterations to the game... we alyway play with all cards including all promos and expensions in the decks to keep the maximum variability to the game....

last game for example, nearly NO buildings were drawn and therefore it was completely different to master than all games before...
some players might not like it but we love to adapt our strategy each and every game and each and every round... you just cannot play a "perfect" game...

I'm just not excited by minor incremental advancements and the emphasis on military.  I won my first game without much military, but we were all new to the game.

Need to get in a few more plays of this, it feels like a friendly stream lined TTA.  It plays smoother than TTA.  

The components are pretty shoddy and the box is ridiculously large for what's in it, which is annoying.  Got it for a cheap price though so I can't complain too much.

I had a pretty bad experience playing this with 3, its possible that the card draw was particularly resource light and caused the issue, but still it made me lower this down considerably.

Best civilization game I've played so far.

An elegant, highly rewarding experience. No downtime, tough choices, high interaction, random set-up each game. Either equal or variable start, in any case no two games will be the same. The drafting mechanism combined with the solitaire worker placement is extremelly simple, yet extremelly tactical mechanism. The game creates constantly the sense of urgency in several fields at the same time (you need culture which is a competitive track to score vps, you need military/stability to keep up with wars, you need money to get the edge on the draft, you need resources to place your workers and build wonders, you need architects to build wonders, you need food and stability to keep your population content and you have an event each round which places even more "stress" to the round).

I think this is by far the best civilization game, and it dwarves even the previous behemoth, Through the Ages (which is also a fine game, but suffers from extreme downtime)

Gameplay is fine, though not very strategic due to the randomness in which the cards come out. The component quality is terrible though. This is especially true considering the price for which this game retails.

RATING: 7
What I like: 

-The unique roles, the feeling of growing your empire through the ages, abstracted military as opposed to in your face miniatures. Very nice.
-Lots of complex strategic decisions.
-Lots of replay value from the factions to the massive amount of cards that vary from game to game. 
-The game is actual much more tactical than strategic. You don't get to say "I'm doing this for the entire game", you have to switch up your strategy based on what cards are drawn. And it's not actually that difficult to constantly change your plans in this. 


What I dislike:

-It's mean. Too mean. You can rise together or fall together in this game. If you are willing to sacrifice what it takes to win the rewards for the round, then you can really drag everyone down with you and make them suffer. It's not like it leaves you in a much better position than them,but it's always an option if you feel it benefits you more than them this time. But if you are not very careful you can get screwed over completely by a small mistake and an opponent who smells blood. There are just some folks I can't play this with cause it's so mean. 
-It's a bit too long.

RATING: 10
Definitely my favorite civ development game yet. I've played a lot of them and they all seem to have such a huge learning curve. This game lends itself to easily be taught and is very intuitive. Yet the dynamics of the game keep changing from game to game. With so many cards already built into it just as the base game you only see about half the cards each game with 5 players so replayability is high. 

[imageid=554375]

The game claims to play 1-5 players. The game includes tiles and a die to play the solo game. The board has indications on it for play of 3, 4 and 5 players. This makes me think it wasn't meant to be played 2 players [i]really[/i]. It's like the game was designed for 3 to 5 and they threw a solo variant but on the box just printed 1-5. It's a pretty lackluster game with only 2 players. It can suffer because of how few cards hit the board. If a ton of war cards come out and only 1 colony or 1 leader well someone is not going to get a leader or colony that turn. Surprisingly I find it's fine at 3 but best at 4 or 5.

RATING: 7
My rating on this one is a little tentative as I think I really need another play to do the game justice. This game feels a lot like Through the Ages, a game I like a lot despite the fact that it's almost exactly the perfect recipe for me to hate. Nations is a lot less fiddly than TTA, but as it turns out, the fiddliness of TTA isn't really something that bothers me that much.

My biggest concern in TTA is also my biggest concern with Nations, which is that it seems like you have to play a military strategy or risk getting stuck in a bad position. Now maybe that's not true with Nations, but it really felt like it. I know that I didn't play this game particularly well, so maybe that's all it was, but I know in my next play I'm going to do my best to do military well.

I think that as long as I know that the game is unforgiving and I'm aware of the fact that you have to play the military game, I'll enjoy this much like I do TTA.

The one thing I found really wonky in this game was the five player rule that converts "best" into "first and second best" and "worst" into "first and second worst". That and the fact that ties count for worst and not for best ended up causing strange situations where players were tied for both best and worst in some categories. It also seemed to disincentivize the worst player from ever trying to improve their standing as you had to not only pass the next player, but also the player above that, as a tie for second worst is still worst. 

Edit:My second play really redeemed this game for me!

Five players was too many for this game, especially with the wonky five player rule which just adds strangeness. Three players made for a very tight competitive game. My concerns about military were largely erased as well. I think the rule we missed about negative stability mitigates the chances of anyone playing a military-only strategy. And it's entirely possible, and probably a good idea, to disband your military for a few turns and still come back to field a new and improved army that's competitive.

I'm really looking forward to more plays, something I couldn't really say after the first botched game. I'm definitely a lot more excited to get this to the table than TTA. I like TTA, but I'd rather play it online than over the board, whereas this is a lot of fun in person.

RATING: 5.5
[thing=126042][/thing] is a civilization game with smooth sailing for the civilizations: dealing with resources is easier than in TTA and Sid Meier's; the military part, although still with relevance for colonization, events and (indirect) wars, is quite friendly, so much so that many events don't even benefit the highest military, as well as that the stability of a nation can reduce the impact of wars to almost nothing, except the loss of 1vp.

With a weakened military, which has more impact in turn order and conquering colonies, and without a trading or commerce mechanic (always a bummer not have one in civ games), [thing=126042][/thing] ends up being more a solitaire exercize of tableau development. Therefore, is possible to have a runaway leader, with few chances of being stopped by actions of the others - still, this is better than bashing the leader, or crippling the game of someone by constant attacks.

The cards seem balanced, in cost, space for workers and use. However, since almost 2/3 of the cards of an Era stay out of the game, which adds variety and replay value, it also makes [thing=126042][/thing] more unpredictable, tatical and, possibly, uneven, as some type of cards may show too rarely.

[thing=126042][/thing] is functional, but I expect more from a good civ game. Even more than in TTA, [thing=126042][/thing] felt more abstract - the correspondence between what a card it, what it cost and what it does is, many times, thin at best, and, in others, downright strange: for instance, it costs more stones and the same number of workers to build the Sphinx than to build the Great Wall of China.

I like the variety provided by the different nations - the balance between than is another matter, one I'm not equiped to talk about. They are good for a replay value aspect.

[thing=126042][/thing], if played in a good pace, is more dynamic than its competitors, and it fits in more limited frames of available time.

In the end, [thing=126042][/thing] pleased less than I thought. It is more solitaire and abstract than I like, and the options seem more limited. I'm not  a person that enjoys the predominance the military has on TTA, still, I prefer it due to a more organic development of the civilizations. Going further, when compared with other civ games, [thing=126042][/thing] falls behind the class - sure, it lasts less, but it also give less. [thing=126042][/thing] isn't a bad game, just way more ordinary than I wanted it to be.

RATING: 7.5
A bit simpler than Through the Ages and with more pleasing player interaction. Instead of all the tiny discs from TtA you just have a maximum of 13 chunky worker meeples to place on your board.

I vastly prefer the simple war/stability stuff in this game as opposed to what TtA did. I was never even sure how TtA was intended to play here.

Also, the card market, at first glance seemingly a direct ripoff of TtA, replenishes more slowly, so that it actually feels like a source of player interaction. Comparisons to 7 Wonders must be looking at this piece. You may have to be quick to grab what you need and you can even hate draft.

But for some reason I'm not getting the "just one more turn" feel of TtA. I have no idea why not. I'll probably have to play TtA again to get an idea. Is it too hard to have an informed guess about what may happen in the future, in Nations? Or is something about the game state too simple?

I do think that Nations is more likely to get played than TtA just because it's much easier to learn and relearn its rules.

...Maybe it's that the economic system is too simple? It's straightforward and I don't wonder afterwards about the possibilities. Nations also often feels like an iterated majorities game over military, stability, and books. There is not really any change of feel over the course of the game, which deprives it of any epic feeling. To me the defining characteristic of a civilization game is the qualitative change in how the game plays over its course. (But I don't rate TtA too highly here either.)

...Yes, after revisiting TtA I think the interest of that game comes from the logistical puzzle of deciding what you should do within one turn, between interruptions in the form of maintenance (corruption especially) and unpredictability in the form of the card market and player interaction. I think a higher percentage of Nations' play is in the card drafting race and the majorities, with the MPS economic management component of the game being much simpler.

So why does TtA have a "just one more turn" feel to it: Because the stuff you decided to delay, and to not do this turn, is still on your mind, and there's an urge to keep playing and "mop up" those loose ends. But in so doing you keep making more loose ends. I think Nations has less of these "loose ends." Usually the end of a round feels like a reasonable stopping point.

Civ builder game that is a deeper cousin to 7 Wonders meets Puerto Rico with a dash of London.  The level of planning required is at a fairly high level, so be prepared to think.  Despite the apparent complexity of the board and card layout, the game mechanics are straight forward and easy to master.  Where you will need to stretch your brain is planning your build, what to develop and the cost vs benefit ratio of paying for one thing over another or to save resources for future rounds.

On the A side vs B side dilemma: Asymmetric is cool from the concept of alternative paths to victory but more challenging to balance.  Even with 7 Wonders the mix of Wonders in play typically favors some strategies over others merely due to the competition for certain cards.  The A sides will force players to find their own way and should lead to alternate paths due to the weight and options of Nations

From a fluff perspective I like that you can create your own Civ.  For example, in one game I had Pyramids, Hanging Gardens, Aqueducts, Cathedrals, and Easter Island statues all accessible from the Suez Canal like an archeological Disneyland or the Las Vegas Strip.  I also had Abraham Lincoln as an advisor but he was killed on the last turn.  Sometimes the cost of freedom is high...

Juego de "civilizaciones". Juego muy divertido y tenso en el que haremos evolucionar a nuestra civilización obteniendo nuevos edificios que nos servirán para adquirir recursos de forma más eficiente. Durante el juego pasaremos por 4 eras distintas haciendo que cuando más avancemos a través de esas eras más caro sea el coste de las cosas pero a su vez más puntos nos dan para el final de la partida. Además están los eventos, las guerras, la estabilidad, el nivel de batalla y los libros (que miden la cultura de tu civilización) en los cuales hay una lucha constante con el resto de jugadores por no salir perjudicados por su posición en cada uno de esos tracks. En resumen juego muy divertido y competitivo que te hace estrujarte el cerebro y que genera pique entre jugadores.

Played once with 3 players and the basic deck.

Pros:

Very historical feel. Every card has an age on when it happened whether it's a leader or a battle. That was pretty cool.

All around good game, and there's not a ton left to luck, which is good.

Less aggressive than some other civ games. 

1 player mode feels well thought out rather than "tacked on." The 1 player mode is a great reason to buy if you're on the fence.

Cons: 

I worry it could get stale after awhile. After one play, there doesn't seem like there's much more too it than making sure your stats increase throughout the game. If I play a few more times, and it does get stale, I'll be lowering my ranking.

There's not much innovation here. If you've played Through the Ages, I could teach you to play this game in less than 10 minutes.

It's very similar to Through the Ages. Several mechanics felt copied straight from it.

"Looks like an old Soviet spreadsheet" was SU&SD's comment on how the game looks. I think it looks great, and much prefer this style to oversaturated mess like Imperial Settlers. There's a good game here, even SU&SD had to admit that. Resources are tight at the beginning of the game, and new players can easily get off to a bad start.

Quite a thinky game this. Thinking in sequences several moves ahead, combined with resource math and backup-plans will reward a player. Because of the variability of cards available to buy, you must always be ready to improvise and adopt.

The game goes rather long (almost 4 hours in my group), promotes some AP, and the individual nation boards are, unfortunately, not balanced.

After my first play, I could see playing more often and my rating going up.  The fact that most of the cards in each deck will not get used gives a great replay value as well as a randomness because you never know what cards will be in play.  As soon as we finished the game I was ready to play it again because I realized how many things I would have done differently.  I'm sure future plays will provide the same post game second guessing, which is an indication to me that this is a great game.

I pondered for a long time on which civ game to get and finally settled on Nations (all the other ones had something I didn't care for – too much downtime, or only spanning a certain period of history). Our relationship is a cordial one but in a way, also a "marriage of reason". Nations is a great game full of interesting tactical choices, but the civilization building aspect is not as strong as I would like. At the end of the game I seldom feel like an inventor, conqueror or a proud father of a nation. I just feel like I played a good eurogame.

-Opinion:
A top-notch civ game for the hobby-gamer. Complexity is well above introduction eurogames but far beneath heavy games. Game seems to be very balanced between military/stability tactic in that both will get benefits. Also every choice seems meaningful because that card you wanted may not be available the next turn. This also causes the game to be more a tactical game and less about optimizing strategies around certain cards which is how I prefer it, I am not the super-optimizing gamer type. The game itself plays out as a game of balancing an unstable resource engine and often you feel the same "feeding anxiety" as in Agricola in a good way. The ages also creep power so it makes switching tactic mid-game feasible when you anyway have to refresh your engine to keep up with the rest. The things I would have wished more from was the art and perhaps even more asymmetry in the advanced production cards. Rules are easy to explain and playtime with 4p, setup and rules-explanation is about 2,5 hours.

-Other thoughts:
Tweaked the decks after my second game to introduce more asymmetry by systematically switching basic cards for interesting int. and adv. cards and trying to keep overall resource balance. Worked well in making the game more interesting but as I also added one more of each category card into each age to allow for 5p game I diluted the decks a bit. This again caused some card-streaks that in one case screwed the ones relying on colonies in that in the first three ages only 5/15 colonies came out. How the decks are chosen will greatly influence the game experience so tune them to your liking, all from predictable and symmetrically balanced to chaotic streaky decks are possible depending on the deck buildup.

-Comments on others comments and reviews:
I assume that many people bashing the game have not even played it, have made serious rule errors or are TtA fanboys who must rip on all other civ-game copies because naturally TtA is da best in everything and there can not and should not be made any attempts at improvements or streamlining. This assumption is because most of the negative things I heard spoken of were nowhere to be found or seem to be extremely easily mitigated if one even has the slightest idea about how the mechanics function. The one negative thing I agree on is that bookkeeping is not always easy, but that can easily be mitigated by treating everything systematically, e.g. producing in the exact order shown on player aids. I also recognize that the game is not for everyone, if you want to be able to predict a game and optimize your strategy according to that then this is not for you, this is tactical and the strategy will have to be in constant motion.

-Comparison to TtA: TtA is way more evil and convoluted. Nations has less possibilities but feels more streamlined and better as a game. Also the military suckiness of TtA is fixed in Nations.

Very good civilisation game, with resource engine building AND maintaining, different avenues of expension (military to get colonies/battle/wars; stability to mitigate wars and get cheap extra workers; advisers that can help focus your stragtegy; building wonders for all kinds of special actions), switching strategies during the game is also -for once- viable; really offers some interesting and significant choices from first to last turn!

[+] thinky game but fast paced (unless you pass long before the other players, who can have a lot of extra turns...), very well balanced, advanced/expert cards support some very odd/bold strategies, for once I love the randomness of available cards / upcomming events
[-] a bit long with 4/5p

RATING: 7
I was inclined to pooh-pooh Nations after reading the rules, because it draws from [gameid=25613] so much that it almost feels like there should be an additional design credit to Vlaada Chvátil.  When I actually played Nations, however, it became clear that the card design is different enough to make it feel like a different beast.  The framework is similar, but there's a much different strategic and tactical feel, and none of the cards feel derivative.  In addition, it's easier to teach, and the military strategy is addressed in a much better fashion here.  Nations also has that wonderful mechanic where every victory point matters.  Getting or losing one VP is not some meaningless exercise, but is a big deal that may mean the difference between victory and a loss.  

That said, this game has balance problems, including a severe runaway leader issue.  Military is so strong that it's incredibly punitive, and once you're on the bottom, you're probably bleeding points to the winner.  What's more, with turn order being military, you're frequently going to be unable to grab a technology to turn it around, meaning that you just play out the string if you fall behind.

As far as Civ goes, there are lots of worse ones out there.  There's a looseness to this game which is quite appealing, and the sheer number of cards makes sessions vary much more than in a lot of Civ games.  I wouldn't buy this counting on being a forever classic, but you'll get an easy few games out of it that are quite entertaining.

sembra + un gestionale che un gioco di civilizzazione, preferisco TTA. 

While Through the Ages already took out the dudes on a map leaving conflict-loving gamers wondering if this still is a civ game, Nations goes a step further and is the "euro-ized" version of Through the Ages. No direct conflict, streamlined mechanisms, short player turns and playing time at the cost of strategic depth and variety. Hardcore BGG gamers will continue to favour Through the Ages, my vote as a euro gamer averse to direct player targetting in euro games goes for Nations.

Takes Through the Ages and removes almost all player interaction, most of the long term strategy and any sense of permanence in building up a civilization through history. As a result it feels like hollow shell of the game it's inspired by. I guess it's a little shorter though.

Very positive after 1 play. Quite similar to Through the Ages though. Will need more plays of both to compare accurately. Since I like TTA, I don't mind it being similar! Slightly more simple than TTA, a tweaked card-buy system, less directly aggressive military, and more randomized cards appearing. The player powers are a huge plus in my book although I have yet to try them. 

Seems like this and TTA may be different enough to coexist although still very similar in many other ways.

May bump to 9 if the player powers work out well.

RATING: 4
I don't know how to rate this game. It's good at being what it is, but I don't want that thing.

I mainly game two-player with my husband and we're equally matched skill-wise. We play fast, don't have AP, enjoy replaying games and are not adverse to direct conflict.

For this reason, I love Through the Ages. It's brutal, strategic, conflict-heavy, unique among modern heavy board games, and rewards repeat plays. Many of the mechanics raise intriguing possibilities, such as the event-stacking. All the wonders and leaders are very very different.

I bought Nations at about the same time and, coming back to it after several plays of TTA, it's not in the same ballpark. It's JASE in TTA clothing - a VP engine worker-placement game with numerous very similar cards and limited direct conflict. It's overly forgiving, bland and a bit 'meh'. I can't see any occasion when I'd rather play Nations than TTA. As such, it's for trade.

That said, if I were in a large cult-of-the-new group with numerous newbies and many players with AP, Nations would be a far better choice. It has large clear boards, which are far too large for two, but probably brilliant with five. It's easy to teach because the mechanics are immediately familiar to anyone who has played Caylus and it's many imitators. You can play it once and not lose miserably, and gives a cut-down TTA-type civ feel... etc. etc. If this sounds like your gaming group, I'd rate this game a 9 or 10. 

For us, though, it's a 4. When I'm in a large group with newbies, I far prefer negotiation/trading/bluffing games like I'm the Boss or Tammany Hall to this type of heads-down soulless resource-conversion fest. Large groups of strangers are simply friends you haven't met yet, after all! :)

I'M CURRENTLY TRYING TO TRADE THIS HOT GAME FOR AN OLD GERMAN-STYLE OOP GAME. I'M ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN WINNER'S CIRCLE and CASTLE. Happy to pay any difference in price. My copy of Nations is in like-new condition, played three times.

RATING: 7.1
Tengo la impresion de que Nations no es dificil de jugar, pero muy dificil de dominar.
Sin duda, es un buen juego. Sin embargo, puede resultar implacable, y a veces hasta frustrante. 

Hasta ahora, mi experiencia con el juego han sido partidas a 2 jugadores, y, en esas partidas, el jugador que se descuelga, lo hizo de forma temprana y definitiva, creandose una brecha imposible de recuperar contra el jugador dominante. Entonces, la partida del segundo jugador se convierte en un suplicio. Esta percepcion del juego a 2 jugadores parece confirmarse con los comentarios de otros jugadores en BGG. 

El juego debe funcionar mucho mejor a partir de 3 jugadores, ya que, por lo menos, cada uno de ellos "gana algo" de vez en cuando.
Pero lo malo del multijugador es que, como te toque alguien con Analisis Paralisis, tambien puede convertirse en un suplicio (aunque de otro tipo).

De todas formas, es un juego que pienso sacar mas a la mesa, a ver que va pasando...

First of all, I love Through the Ages.  It has an agonizing feel to it as you juggle all the moving parts to make the best plans and have the best civilization.  Nations is a bit looser, with a lot of the tension coming from the selection of the cards from the main board.  I can appreciate the design, and I really like the way that the wars are less a game-changer here than in TtA, but it's not a game I would choose to play over TtA.  It does a lot of things right, and I would definitely play it again, but if I have the time to play this game and want to play something like TtA, I'll just make myself available for more time and play that instead.

A somewhat abstracted civilization/engine builder that comes in an annoyingly huge box. I'm not big on Euros, but the whole civ building stuff sounded interesting so I ended up acquiring it. Do not expect some grand epic civilization builder, the game is fairly light both in rules and gameplay. The rules are concise, clear and well written. I don't mind the pasted on theme. I do like that it's not fiddly (even with the solitaire dummy player), and that there are a lot of cards for variety. It plays really quick solitaire, and I assume it's not too bad multiplayer either. I will keep this game it in my collection for when I'm in need for some light civ building fun.

UPDATE: Got an offer to trade this for A Distant Plain. Was not a hard choice to make for me as I love the COIN series.

I'm writing this with a big smile on my mug and a glass of wine in my hand. Its Feb 10th and I just received my BGG Secret Santa gift!

It was wrapped with a lot of care and attention. I opened it with nervous anticipation to find Nations! a game that sneaked its way on to my wishlist only after a couple of plays.

Words cannot express how thankful I am for this gesture. Secret Santa is all about giving and I wasn't sad when the holidays went by, but I was a bit jealous when I saw others post their loot. Well, thanks to my (backup) Santa, I got to have Christmas again in February. I can't wait to break this out and try it again. You are a special one Santa. I'm deeply thankful for this gift.

Nations is the perfect Euro take on the popular Civilization category of games. A lot of people call it Through the Ages light and I think that is an apt description. It's still a fairly heavy game, but it focuses more on building a tableau of point scoring workers than the usual tech tree/conquest engines found in most other Civ games.

The only thing that bugs me is the rather small amount of civilizations included in the box. Asymmetrical starting points and powers are one of my favorite features in these sort of games and while Nations has them, there just isn't enough of them. Hopefully an expansion will come out soon to up the count, because other than that little limitation, this is a damn fine game.

3.8 - with Dynasties expansion. First Edition has Grand Duchy of Finland promo card. Very good game, smart, interconnected, well done, not for us, though, because of the constant need to prepare for disasters (constantly being beat up by the game and by other players), wars, etc. That adds tension and excitement to the game, but not the good kind of tension and excitement. In other words, great game, but not fun for us.

[i]Update: Sold it only because it competed directly with Through The Ages in my collection, I just don't need two civ-building games.[/i]

Looks dreadful, but otherwise this is a good game with a ton of tough decisions to be made. I really like the huge variety of cards. Also, I like how designers minimized downtime here, Nations is more dynamic than Through The Ages, the flow of the round is as smooth as it gets. 

But I have to say that it feels more like a worker placement/resource management game rather than a "civilization builder". Unlike Through The Ages where you have different priorities at various stages of the game, here there's no real sense of progress, each era feels pretty much the same as you focus on the exact same things all the time. The numbers get higher, but the game "doesn't tell a story". 

Keep in mind that this game is very unforgiving - Nations is extremely prone to the "snowball effect". If you don't get your resource engine running properly fast enough, it will be almost impossible for you to catch up with the others. Sometimes the winner can be clearly determined halfway through the game (especially in 2P games).

While not perfect, Nations still offers a satisfying gaming experience. The solo variant works like a charm!

Enjoyed 16 solo games so far, the last few with Dynasties and all the cards mixed in. I've stuck to using the balanced draw variant because once I added all the cards the mix was very unbalanced until I switched to the balanced draw, and for solo play this was highly unsatisfying since you want some ability to compare between games (the solo game is high score only). I'm very much looking forward to a 2p or multiplayer game but very happy with the solo play.

A step towards bigger, better games?

Game engine looks slick and the artwork on the tiles is lovely watercolours. Shame about the graphic design for numbers, boards and cards which absolutely stinks. Stock photoshop bevel and emboss is akin to that cartoon text font that any decent designer banished in the '90s.

I like the old fashioned dual colour schemes of the ancient avalon hill civ games - the cards and chits in that game have real magic, reminiscent of the monochrome railway restaurant tickets I used to collect when riding through east berlin on the train in the '70s.

A very Euro-feeling worker placement civ game that plays surprisingly quickly, and more importantly, doesn't feel like it's dragging. Wars hit everyone when activated rather than picking a player to attack, which I like overall. I also like that you can see some upcoming cards but not every card in the game will come out, which makes for a nice mix of strategy and tactics. It's not a very forgiving game (I've been in games where 1 player just gets crushed pretty early without having played unusually poorly or anything and that's not fun for anyone,) however difficulty can be adjusted per player which is nice for new players, kids, etc.

Not a good game for 2p.  We've played multiple times now, and each of the games seemed to suffer from runaway leader problems.  To be fair, the rulebook clarifies that 2 player games are especially difficult and that it may seem like the game is over by the end or even the beginning of the 2nd age.  All of our games have CLEARLY been over by that point.

Nations is a very tactical game that requires you make the best of what cards come out every round. You will have many tough decisions to make and the gameplay is exciting and thinky without completely burning your brain. There aren't many civilization games can be played in a couple of hours, solo, and that please be euro game crowd who aren't looking to push miniatures around and battle constantly. However, this is one that does satisfy me in these areas and it is a great game!

This is a solid engine building game.  Retooling your engine from age to age... and even within a round... can give a nice growing civilization feel if you look for it.  I did find the wars to be a bit weirdly abstracted... but dealing with people going on the offensive or buying wars defensively does lead to some interesting decision making.

The solo game works but this will always be better with some real competition.

While we were in Essen, we saw a lot of people carrying the huge box of Nations. We went to the publishers booth and noticed that the tables it was played on, were filled with people all the time. The pricetag of EUR60,- made it also a game we wouldn’t buy before we tried it.

But then it happened. Only a couple of weeks after Spiel, the price dropped with almost 50% in Germany. There was only a limited amount available, watched a review on BGG, and we didn’t hesitate and ordered a copy. The only thing that worried us a bit, was the delivery-time. 3-7 weeks. In the worst case, it would make it to our home just before Christmas. That would make it a great Christmas gift for M. to give to P. After a little more then 3 weeks the copy of Nations already arrived. P. didn’t want to wait. M. just said wait until Christmas. As always a man has to listen to his wife, so I did, and before I knew there it was. Christmas. Time to play nations.

I knew this wouldn’t be an easy family game. When I opened the box, the rulebook smiled to me. 24 pages. Oops, that’s a little more paper then I expected. Started to read the rules, and I immediately discovered the first good thing about this game. Well written rules. Everybody knows well written rules are a big problem the last couple of years. In fact it’s such a big problem that you will be surprised if you find a game with well written rules inside. The rules are easy to understand, and very clear. You hardly will have to read back because you don’t understand what they’re talking about.

The other very nice thing of this game, are the custom shape tokens. What an improvement compared to other games (like Alea games, which have the same shape of components for almost everything (VP’s are small hexagons (Louis XIV, Notre Dame, Augsburg 1520))). Minor aspect of this, is the fact that it will take more time to punch them out of the cardboard, and you will have to be more careful, otherwise the pieces might get damaged.

Then the cards, I was not happy with them. They are standard cards, nothing wrong about that, but in the right bottom corners (and if I say corner, I mean corner), there are some tiny (and if I say tiny, I mean very tiny) symbols on some of the cards (the advanced and the expert cards). These symbols have about the size of 1/20 of an inch, which are placed about the same distance from the corner. Normally I wouldn’t discover when a card is misaligned a little bit (1/30″). But in this case, it makes a difference, because the tiny symbols did partly fall of the edge, and this way it was even harder to recognize them. Also you’ll have to sort all of the cards (by type and age) before your first game. It took us about 15 minutes. Not a big deal, but why don’t place them in the right order after printing them?

As said, rules are very clear. The game takes 4 periods to play and each period will take 2 turns. So there are 8 rounds to play, and each round will take 3 phases. Phase one is the Maintenance Phase, and will take about 2 minutes. Phase two is the Action Phase, and this is the phase were it’s all about. Phase three is the Resolution Phase, and will also take only a couple of minutes.

Phase two, the Action Phase, is the phase where you will spend the most time. During this phase you can do one of the three available actions:

    Buy a progress card. You can buy a progress card from one of the three rows on the progress board. 1st row will cost 1 gold. 2nd row, 2 gold and 3rd row – 3 gold. When you buy a progress card you place it on your player-board (buildings, military, colonies, advisor and wonders), place it on the scoring board (war) or resolve it immediately (battle, golden age. The number of places on your player-board is limited per card type, but you can always destroy a previous placed card.
    Place a worker. You can place one of your workers on one of your buildings/military cards on your player board. Some cards will produce resources at the end of the round, while other cards will give you stability or military-power immediately. Placing a working will cost you stone. Some of the cards have cost to upkeep it at the end of the round.
    Hire an architect. Architects are needed to build the wonders. Some wonders will need 1 architect, others will need more. Architects are taken from the common pool on the scoring board.

During the Action Phase, every player takes on of the possible actions. Then the next player is on turn. This takes on, until every player has passed.

When a period ends, there is a scoring round. A player scores 1VP for every other player that is behind him on the heritage track on the scoring board.

Basically this is all there is to this game. Not very difficult, and once you understand the iconography, it’s pretty clear.

This is not a typical P&M game. It’s no secret that we like medium-weight family-games the most. But we were very curious to play a civilization game. And I think that it wasn’t a bad choice to become Nations the first experience in the genre. It isn’t a very hard game to play. It isn’t a brain burner. It plays pretty fast (I’m sure you’ll manage to play in 40-45 minutes per player after a couple of plays). You’ll get the feeling that you are developing your Nation. The mechanics feels logical and makes sense. After all, I only can say, this is a P&M game. We like it very much, and could recommend it to everybody who wants to play a heavier game then a family game is.

Too similar to Through the Ages, but not nearly as good.  If you start last in turn order, it can be very hard to be competitive.  The players in front of you can shut you out of the military by buying all the military cards and put you in a death spiral as you get pummeled by wars, events, and can't change your position.  This is the biggest flaw in the game.

My first game seemed overly punishing which lessened the fun factor. I wouldn't mind playing again though. Having said that, I enjoyed the dice version quite a bit more.

With the variable starter boards and the slow, heavy board development, Nations fills the Terra Mystica gap better than Terra Mystica does.  It's a shame because TM's theme is cooler.

I love this game.  This is everything I wanted Through the Ages and Clash of Cultures to be.  Definitely my favorite civ building game.  Would only be made better by using a fantasy theme which I prefer, but would play this anytime.

Only possible complaint is, after multiple plays, there's a definite experience advantage here.  Explains why there are difficulty level handicaps available.

After 1 Play: Sort of interesting, but took too long for what it is.  Not enough of building your engine, too much running it over and over again.

Biggest problem with this game is that it kicks you when you are down over and over and over and over again.

This is a difficult one for me, as there are parts of this game I quite enjoy.

Through the Ages 'lite' it is not. It dumps a lot of TtA stuff, but. Can still fall in the 3 to 4 hour range with 4+ players.

My biggest gripes are that military seems grossly overpowered, allowing you to go first each turn, be free of the fear of war, gain good beneifts from battles and colonies, AND benefit from the occasional random event. This leads to rich get richer situation as they always get the pick of the crop. And unfortunately, the poor tend to get poorer too. This game lacks any kind of 'catch up' mechanic, and an early mistake, or even poor first turn can mean you have zero chance of winning but you go through the motions anyway. Hell, I'd say generally speaking you could call the eventual winner of the game after the first scoring turn - and there's literally nothing you can do about stopping a runaway leader.

Random card draws and ridiculously crippling random events round off the triumverate of bad news.

And a slight negative on top of all this, it doesn't really *feel* like you're building a civilisation, more an engine to get the highest score. That's fine, but don't come expecting to find a game rich in theme (pasted on is probably more appropriate).

I find the war mechanism interesting though, and there are some elegant mechanics in play, even if they aren't perhaps best realised in this.

Sadly, I can't score this game higher than 5 - and tbh, that feels a bit generous.

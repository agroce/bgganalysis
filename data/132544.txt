Well, it's okay. The AC/DC current meter allows for the game to become too lopsided, especially with high player counts, although I could see it being even more frustrating with low player counts. Otherwise, it's thematically fun but mostly unremarkable. Downgraded from 7.7 to 6.9.

LIKE: Stock manipulation is interesting (needs the house luminary rule), but not an overly complex game. Feels simple but deep. The AC/DC track was fun interaction.
DISLIKE: Some subtle problems with the stock board being limited. Also needs one small house rule when buying stocks. Difficult remembering when to use your character's power. On the final round, players can get stuck with nothing to do.

OVERALL: The game was better than I thought. Being in last turn order was interesting because of the AC/DC track, yet being first had advantages, too. Solid game, but it can get a bit mathy. Not sure about replayability.

Anmerkung zum deutschen Übersetzungspaket der Spieleschmiede:

Die deutsche Regel ist im A4-Format und passt nicht ohne Knicken/Biegen in die Schachtel. Die Originalregel ist im US-Letter-Format.

Die deutschen Karten sind schmaler und dünner als die Originalkarten mit der Folge, dass die englischen Zusatzkarten (2), die zwischen Folie und Schachtel eingeschweißt waren, nicht zu den deutschen Karten passen.

Tesla vs Edison's theme of competition between rapidly developing technologies promises something really interesting. Regrettably, the technological development in this game is disappointingly linear and abstracted.  There is also network building that has echoes of Power Grid.  However, both network building and development are entirely subsidiary to shares, whose value is the only source of victory points. That's unfortunate, not only in its disservice to a fine theme, but because without house rules the stock market, with it's failure to sufficiently limit share churn, is a train wreck.

Tesla vs Edison is a handsome game, with production values to match.

One of those kickstarters that needed an expansion (well really even just the expansion rules) to fix some broken-ness about the base game so really you need to do some tweaks and maybe have the expansion to get a good game,  But with the expansion its a good if unremarkable game.  Like mix of stock, building, technology and ac/dc defamation type actions  and really like how you use cards with potential bonuses for actions.  Overall a fun, fairly intiative to play game with not much choices on a turn but a good amount of fun.

We bought the game just after the release. The theme was great, the graphics of the game looked so beautiful, and the mechanics seemed like Power Grid combined with some serious stock market mechanics. So the game overall looked very promissing and we were really looking forward to play. However it appeared to be a total disappointment. The game just didn't work out. Very dry mechanics, no point for the cards of the characters and so few actions to play with.

With the expansion.

The game overall is fine, but does feel a bit fragile.  I haven't played without the expansion, but even with the expansion the stock market track is too powerful.  Feels like you get tanked and pulled out of the game due to decisions that are not yours.  Probably a little long for what it is as well.

Love the art, love the theme, and really like the way the game plays a lot. However, the balance is a real issue. The stock market part of the game is really all there is to it which makes it almost unplayable for me. I'm holding on to it waiting for the expansion to hope that it fixes the problems because I really like everything else about the game.

Update: The expansion absolutely saves this game. I love the expansion and I really like TvE a lot now. Changed from a 5.

Overall enjoyed my first play of this game.

Pros: Every action felt important and couldn't be wasted.  "Limited" resources.  Lots of choices to be made.

Cons: Potential for AP issues at least at first. Some inventors seemed better than others.  Game seemed to be segmented (tech early, then cities, stock market at the end).  Might change with repeated plays, as I already had realized a few things I should've done differently by the end.  

Definitely want to try this one again.

There are many elements of this game that I enjoyed. There are several markets that can be manipulated, and it's all about the dynamic between the players. 

However, the entire game seems dependent on the final share rounds, so you really just spend a couple of hours positioning yourself for that final round. And you are then subject to whims of the other players. Close.

Update: Rerating based on having played the expansion, which solves the endgame issues that ruined the original. It adds some additional ways to score which makes it seem a bit point-salady, but still very much enjoyed it, and glad to see the promise in the game fulfilled.

Very good. "Mathy" euroish historical themed mashup of 18xx and Powergrid. Theme is very dry with little in the way of true flavor, which is really the only bad thing I can say about it. Good stock market mechanic, action selection is tight and dictated by cards you bid for at the beginning of every other turn. Too notch components. Played with one of the developers at Gencon 2015, super nice guy. If you want a more interactive, cutthroat Power grid with several paths to victory, get it, but don't expect a very flavorful experience.

Tesla vs. Edison has two major problems: the stock market is so dominant that you can win by ignoring the other two-thirds of the board and just playing it, and the starting Inventors are not balanced.  It's also very easy to get behind and have no chance of catching up, because those doing well on the stock market are making major bank each turn, which they invest to make more money, and so on.  Since you always sell stock at the optimum price (since your selling it pushes the price down again), it's a mechanical and low-risk path to victory.

The artwork and production design are top-notch.  They deserve a much better game behind them.

I have been eyeing this game since seeing it demoed at Origins 2016, and was so happy to win a copy of this, the Powering Up! expansion, and Bonus AIs at Gen Con 2016.

Me and my fiance just got done playing the base game last night and had a great time.  The theme is strong, and the artwork and pieces are beautiful and substantial.  Despite the rules being a little complicated to learn at first, the game played relatively fast once we got into it.  I feel that this game has tons of room for re-playability depending on the Luminaries and Propaganda that we draw in subsequent games, and what strategies we may pick.

Having read the prior reviews and learning more about the history of these inventors, we were prepared for and had no qualms about the importance of the stock market in the game, given that this was true to what these inventors had to experience in real life.

We are excited to play it again with the Expansion.

[Played with the Powering Up] I like this game, but I'm not convinced it was developed adequately. The scoring feels wonky, and I've posted in the forums about it and tried some variants that someone else came up with (that I further modified to my liking). 

As a solo game, it's good and fun. I like playing against the AIs. I also like playing against the AIs in multiplayer games. But the scoring is tilted way too far towards stock. You can separate yourself by double digits from other players via stock scoring and then only make up onesy-twosies with the other 3 scoring categories. I think it needs some kind of point scoring balance or else it just comes down to stock, making the other scoring categories practically superfluous.

I see what they tried to do with the HQ, and while I like the asymmetric powers, I don't think there's any ability to differentiate in scoring with them. Complicating this is that Thompson has an ability to prevent his stock from ever dropping in the game. 

I'm not sure where I am with the game. I like it (or maybe more accurately want to like it), but I think the variants I tried still need some tweaks. Will I put the effort in? Remains to be seen.

Backed on Kickstarter. This got me interested in learning about the war of currents history and to read into the personality and genius of Nikola Tesla. Thus, I really looked forward to it. And although I have played it once, with some incorrect interpretation of rules, I find this to be unbalanced and criticism of stock-market driven results to be justified. The expansion promises to bring-in improved balance, and I do hope so. I want to see this game get some more love due to the great setting alone, although admittedly, the theme did not manifest itself as much as I had hoped for.

I've played several games of this, and my rating has not changed.  My gaming group really enjoys playing.  I think the stock market could be a bit modified(like the suggestion of only including a single stock at the beginning of the game, and making more available as you complete projects), but it's not completely broken(and still fun). Some of the inventors are more powerful than others(Edison), but that doesn't necessarily mean a win.  Don't neglect the propaganda tracks(especially if you get a late start in the patent game), and make sure you pay attention to those stocks!  The suspense at the end of the game really makes this game shine.

Excellent game that combines the race for map domination of Power Grid with a stock market that ultimately determines victory.

The game is a medium-heavy weight that is moderately fiddly with several small rules that must be kept track of in order to scale the game properly into end-game. This game was loved by members of my game group who hated Acquire, so I'm glad I've found a stock game that they enjoy, as it's one of my favorite mechanisms.

I haven't had a chance to play the full game, but so far I absolutely love it!

Happy to report that having played with the expansion, it fixed there problems I had with the original game. I really enjoyed my first play with the expansion and this is power grid killer for me as I prefer the stock market over the resource management of power grid

4->7


-----------------
The game feels much like power grid + more stuff and stocks. However you will realize at the end of the game that it is mostly a stock game because that ultimately dictates the victory.

The little perks from the other stuff throughout the game pales in comparison to the manipulation of the market that happens toward the end of the game.

I'm not a big fan of the technology track as I feel there is a big punishment for not having patents. The starting powers are also not balanced

After playing this game twice, once 3p and once 5p, you definitely want 4-5 to for the competition aspect of the various tracks. But in the end, it felts too much like a stock manipulation game and your earlier actions aren't well rewarded if you aren't focused on that part of it

Just seems disjointed is all. After giving it a few shots, I think I'm finished exploring this one

Rating based on one 2-player game.
I am very disappointed by the game. The theme suggested that you are playing inventors and therefore the game is about inventions. In fact inventions are only a really minor factor in the game. In principle it it a pure stock market game. Futhermore negative is that at least the German rules are written in a very compilcated way, where you have to read sentences multiple times in order to get a grib on what might be meant. The German rule book does not even fit into the box and the translations on the German cards are partially awful.
Last but not least in our game both player could do only one sensful action in the last round, since all shares were sold, fullfilling any projects was not possible due to missing technology levels and raising those would have left not actions open in order to fullfull projects.
One could argue that we did not plan far enough and therefore it was caused by us, but this should not happen in a good game. Bad planning should lead to less could possiblities of actions but not to no ways to do anything.

Opinion: 
Update on the expansion: rate increased after palying the expansion, this is one of those expansions that goes into the base game, would not consider to play the game again without it.
We can say that the expansion corrects some of the flaws the game had, making it tense to the end and giving players lot of options.
Now you have an event at the start of each turn, they can spoil your turn, but you can be ready for them. All of them thematic.
Players have now their own laboratory, making the game more asymetric. This laboratory changes the market action into build your laboratory action. Instead of going to the market, you can build one part of the laboratory, and each part give the player different bonuses, including another way of gaining victory points.
The market is only done in the bookkeeping phase, and players have only one action there, no option to sell shares, but to exchange one for another, and then buy another one.
And the big difference comes with the scoring, you score for money in your hand, for what you have built in your laboratory, and, depending if you have built the special part of your lab, for what you have built on the board. Obviously, you still score for your shares, but the victory points have changed to 6 for the most value Company, 5 for second and so on... therefore there is no much importance in the scoring if one Company ended at 70, and the second one at 40, points will be 6 and 5....
Do not forget that this is an economic game, but now every thing you do during the game has its relevance, and not only the value of your shares, with no option to ruin any Company selling shares


Applying one of the variants for the market, probably can go higher. You have to manage a Company and make it profitable. For this you have to build projects in different cities (like in Power Grid), but you have to develop your knowledge with the patents. All in order to make your Company grows. But you have to take a look to the stock market, and this is what this game is about, this is an economic game where all that matters are the stocks of the Companies. All other stuff around this is the way you can make your Company grows, but you have to focus on the stock market. So far I have liked the game, how everything is set for this growing, and how the market works.
Right now is a game I like to play and I will when someone puts it on the table, however, I will not buy the game at this moment

Joc econòmic de compra-venta d'accions de companyes elèctriques. Els jugadors adquireixen contractes (basats en un mapa amb localitzacions connectades), compren i venen accions i avancen en tracks de tecnologia. Hi han dos diferents branques de tecnologia (AC o DC) i, segons el que veig a les regles, es tracta de especialitzarse en un dels dos e intentar que sigui el dominant.

La part de les accions té gracia, el mercat és molt dinámic i es presta a putejar a la resta de jugadors. La resta del joc no m'atrau gaire, les accions son poc variades i no sembla gaire rejugable. En principi sembla que no m'agradarà.

Played twice.  The stock market manipulation is rather obviously curtailed to avoid making this the 18xx edition of Power Grid!  As such, victory can be achieved by focussing either on the stock market, or on the other two elements: developing patents and building the country-wide infrastructure to supply power.

This game feels a bit like Power Grid with stock.  The stock mechanic is interesting, but a bit awkward (even with the expansion rules). You can take yourself out of the game if you can't consistently upgrade both your power and bulb tech.  Great production quality and the historical foundation is fantastic.

Stock market simulation with aggressive positioning for technology standing as well as expanding areas of control. I think this can be more logically explained but when it came to game end, it seemed to come out of the blue, which of course screws with planning. The game is not intuitive, meaning there is trial and error in play until you can see what needs to be done (those who know will do this immediately, allowing them to own your ass and never look back as run away leaders rule the board). Put onto my trade list, but may rethink this if I play it a bit more.

RATING: 6.4
Broken game with stock mechanics. There is no point investing in technology in DC or AC. You just need to lead the technology for lamb technology and patent, then manipulate the stock exchanges. You dont need anything else to win the game. It is more a stock exchange game rather than electrical techs.  Good theme but failed by mechanics.

I've only played the game with the Powering Up expansion so my reviews are there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've only played this with the expansion, so that might skew my rating one way or the other. It's a nice lighter economic game. The fact that throughout the game you're recruiting your pool of people to customize your strengths and weaknesses is cool, though the fact that it can be so ahistorical is a bit odd. There's also the problem that at three players you necessarily have at least two working in one type of power. So either it's two to one and so the one guy is pretty disadvantaged, or all three players just go along the same power type and then the whole 'war of currents' aspect is pretty minimized. And at least in my game the map was a little too open, even considering we were restricted to about half of it playing only a 3 player game. It never felt like I was in any danger of running out of cities to expand to.

As far as what the expansion adds, it seems like the biggest thing is there are four cards per character that have special player powers and need to be activated throughout the game. They were ok, but not that exciting. Everyone had one that made some money, one that made researching easier, one that influenced the propoganda, and one for endgame scoring. And the endgame scoring ones all ended up being worth about the same amount. But it's worth 10 points to just activate all of them, so we all made a point of doing our last, least useful one, at the very end of the game.

So far I've been pretty negative, but to be clear I did enjoy this game. I think the most interesting thing about the game was manipulating the stock market, but I found myself wishing I could do more there. I also wished that rather than all of these extraneous point opportunities the winner was just the person with the strongest stock portfolio. They ended up being the same person in my game anyway since the other point sources ended up being so close, but still, that just makes me think they didn't need to be there at all. From what I can tell the base game actually does what I wanted, but I haven't played it so I can't say for sure. I am hopeful though. My rating is partly speculative that I'd like the base game better than the game with the expansion.

Initial Rating: 4.5 (August 2015)

I’m disappointed, I was expecting a heavier game but the decisions in Tesla vs. Edison: War of Currents aren’t that hard/interesting. Buying stocks is the most important action by far (stocks are the only way to earn VPs) and I feel there is something weird with the way it works. Everything else you do in the game will be overshadowed by the stocks and it is a shame because the other parts of the game seemed very neat :/. 

There is a fair amount of luck with the advertisement cards, right now it bothers me as it seems this luck cannot be controlled/mitigated. I’m particularly bothered by the way they can alter turn order in a random way.

The game components are ok, but I dislike the art of the cards. I like the game board. Some of the cards seem unbalanced but as they are auctioned I’m not bothered by this.

Bottom line, Tesla vs. Edison: War of Currents is much lighter than I expected, thus my desire to play the game again is rather low. Also it seems manipulating the stock market is the dominant strategy. I will read the rules soon to see if we played it right, but for now I’m leaning toward selling my copy of the game. I feel the game actions and cards are out of balance.

Current Rating: 4.5

I still haven’t read the rules, but some friends who invited me to play the game again said 1. The rules are very badly written and 2. The game doesn’t have any luck with the advertisement cards, they are face up and you choose the one you want.

With the correct set of rules (I believe) the game improves a bit for me, but not by much. I still feel there is something weird with the game (perhaps under developed) and I didn’t have much fun playing it.

It seems the luminaries that give $ are much more powerful than the others, because at the end you need to generate money to buy stocks and these characters give discounts to these actions when you buy AND when you sell, even in the same action! (this feels wrong). Along the same lines, It seems Edison is the most powerful main character, he never pays for patents and he never pays other players.

My desire to play Tesla Vs. Edison continues to be low, so I don’t regret I sold the game.

Current Rating: 4.0

RATING: 8
Everything is refined sharply - resources, luminaries, contracts, action variety, turn length, making for compelling macro and micro choices.  Screw-yr-neighbor opportunities at every turn.  Stock manip we view as a feature, not a bug.  Biggest quibble is player role balance - Tesla is punishingly difficult to play as (particularly with poor luminary draw); Edison disproportionately strong.  World-class bits.

*update*  Stock flipping strategy extremely powerful, difficult to counter, and least fun to play.  Need more plays to determine if this overshadows the games many charms as much as it seems to. Rating a 6, as an 8 if flipping can be countered, 4 if not. Averages!

*update2* Implemented house rule that only first stock transaction (instead of all) gets the luminary $ bonus.  So far this tweak nicely rebalances the mechanisms, and restores the 8/10 experience!

Tesla woefully underpowered, Edison and the leader with stock market bonuses very overpowered.

As Tesla you *must* grab a luminary with 2 gears, or the ability to buy patents in the first round, or it's game over for you.

Seems like buying and selling other players stocks repeatedly (and making money while doing so!), and doing almost nothing else, is a degenerate strategy.

Interesting concept, but really poor execution and balancing.

Powering Up expansion a must to fix game.  The AI bots are a neat addition in the expansion.  I love the theme.  Not many actions to take so should be easy to play/teach as long as someone familiar with the game can manage all the track bumps and what not
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Tentative rating based on five plays, it may change, probably more likely to go down instead of up.  The main issue that some have raised that in my view requires more empirical data is whether or not one of the four possible actions (playing the stock market) is overpowered to the extent that other actions (notably building up your technology and powering more cities) is overshadowed.  Jury is still out on this one.  I wanted to like this game more, and will gladly play it again, but the key advice is that you ignore the stock market aspect at your peril.

UPDATE:  Still maintaining my initial rating of 7 while eagerly awaiting the new expansion (just backed on KickStarter) which I am hopeful might solve some of the balance issues noted in the above comment.

Great nod to PowerGrid with a stock market manipulation mechanic that was a lot of fun. Rules are a bit unclear, but the game mechanic is relatively simple to learn, but complex to master the subtleties of balancing advancing your company's worth with working the market to your advantage.  

The game is beautiful on the table, and had some really cool competitive dynamics.

I really want to like this game. The theme is great, you build an economic engine and there is a stock market. However, the game has some serious issue with game balance. The characters you choose in the beginning is very unbalanced. Edison is by far the best character in my opinion. We have even tried to play with only one of his abilities and he is still the strongest. I really like the idea with the stock market and I have no problem with the stock market to be ruthless. However, once you get to phase two or three in the game the bonus for doing stock actions is so great if you have a character with financial ability. You can earn tons of money just by buying and selling stocks. In addition, your opponents stock value plummets. The game basically ends up with trying to get as money characters with financial ability as possible. It is a shame because this could have been really a great game

Was exited about the historical theme. Well what could wrong? Even with the expansion, your choices feel so limited and obvious. This game, if that's what you want to call it, makes you feel like you're in a cardboard box. It's too rigid. Choices feel obvious. This is not a game, it's like following the instructions on how to put a light bulb in a lamp. Entire game group was disappointed. Not to mention it's lengthy for what it is.

Tried the new expansion, and do like it a bit better, but ended up going with Stockpile.  This one runs a bit too long.

With the Powering Up! Expansion this is a 9/10.  Like it quite a bit.

Pessimo, davvero pessimo. Playtesting superficiale e situazioni di gioco assurde. Peccato perché il tema è interessante e poteva essere sviluppato diversamente.

Lame theme. A "war" on currents turns out to be a Power Grid type exercise of building power plants and getting dividends each turn, and building more. But you actually win the game by buying stock in the player's companies - either more stock than the other players, or by guessing correctly which company will build the most power plants and buying that. And you can tank a stock price by selling its stock in order to invest in a more promising company. Yep, it's another king-making stock game. Just what we didn't need. It gets a 6 at least because it hangs together ok for the type of game it is.

RATING: 4
Rating w/ the expansion. Since you receive at most 8 shares during the game, and everyone starts with a free president's share that's worth 4 (!) shares, we found the best reason to buy your opponents (and boost their stock value) is so you can sell it later (and drop their stock value even more). This can generate an 8+ point swing, after which your opponent can go tit-for-tat and put you both roughly back where you started. Not as interesting as I'd hoped.

Meh. This game is overly complex, to the point of frustration. Halfway through reading the rules, I was so lost, I didn't even want to play. Nonetheless, we started best we could. The end game ephasis on stock portfolio overshadows everything, and so many aspects of this game are imbalanced. Like, why are propaganda bonuses so high, yet its nearly impossible to move up on tech with a single illuminator? The AC/DC fame track was useful, but it seemed imbalanced to have to waste an action every round to ensure a higher fame stat just to get the bonus stock.

(+) Beautiful game! I love the artwork in this game, the game money, etc. They also did a great job integrating historical events into this game.

(+) Original mechanics: stock manipulation, patents, some engine building with the connection of cities, variable player powers, ... This game sure has character

(+) Very reasonable game time: you can play this game in 90 minutes.

(-) The game suffers from some mechanical flaws: the stock market principle is interesting, but it feels unbalanced. ([i]in the end, cash doesn't count, so you need to convert as much as possible to shares, even if it are lousy shares. With one single action you can buy and sell different shares, which results in actions in which expensive shares are sold (crashing their price immediately) in order to exchange them for cheaper shares - there is some unpleasant player interaction going on in such cases[/i]). These mechanical flaws are unfortunately a very significant part of the game and they may affect replayability greatly.

(-) The variable player powers also feel unbalanced. The Edison character might be overpowered compared to the other 4 characters?

[u]Hints:[/u]
(*) Try to race in order to connect level I cities quickly: they are cheap and increase your income cheaply

(*) It makes sense to prioritize also on technological advancement (first in lightbulbs maybe?) and obtain a patent on lvl 3, 4 (or 5) quickly. Depending on how others invest on AC or DC-tech, it is unwise to invest heavily into a technology by yourself: have at least one other ally. Also increase your technology to a level matching your light bulb technology and try to acquire a patent at this level is possible. After that, focus on connecting cities in order to raise your share value and your income.

(*) This game is all about the stock market. Whenever possible, sell expensive shares in order to obtain cash you can put to use to buy cheap shares of companies which are likely to build on the map any time soon (enough cash + enough technological devolopment to snatch away good spots on the map). Try to buy as many shares as possible of companies which will grown at a time when they are still cheap.

Really wanted to like this, but smacking your opponent sideways in regard to selling opponents stock, was a little too much.

RATING: 4
Game with five players felt flat and uninspired, primarily because the scores were so disparate.

Accumulating stock seems to be a bit too powerful in our game.  Perhaps we haven't figured out the counter, but churning the market (dump shares to buy other shares while pocketing the luminary dollars to gain more funds to buy more shares) seems to be over-powered compared to building projects, expanding tech.

We have two plays of Tesla verse Edison under our belts I wanted to do a quick review of it. Tesla verse Edison is an economic action selection game were at the end the person with the most expensive stock portfolio is the winner. I was pleasantly surprised at how fun this game was even at two players. First, most stock and economic games are pretty long and can drag on. Tesla verse Edison really held to the 20 min per person, and the flow was great. It was a thinking game and even the auctions worked well. If you want a good economic game this is one to buy.  RW

Shipped over a MONTH early folks!
Perfect condition.
Played 2P only so far. Needs work for 2P. I expect MP will be loads more fun. Will re-rate after MP.

Update October 2015- Without house rules the game is broken and it will likely be cannibalized for it's gorgeous components unless Dirk comes up with something. I know expansions are in the work already but no way will I sink more money into this game without the base game being fixed. 
I also had to re-rank the game. Dirk is a great guy and I respect him and my opinion of the game is independent of Dirk.

RATING: 6.5
Game is great, but there are a lot of small things that could use polishing. 
The math to calculate a lot of the moves in the game are overly complex, not undoable, but essentially add unnecessary calculations to figure out what you are receiving. 
Some characters felt imbalanced (need to play more games to justify this). 
Player aids were absolutely necessary to play this game, but none were included. 

One big mechanic that needs work is the stock market system. It's an amazing idea, but it doesn't work the way it is intended. Would love to see this developed more.

RATING: 6
A flawed game that seems to hold promise, but the whole stock market part of the game needs to be redesigned or house ruled for it to really work. As it is, there is little incentive to build and expand companies, which comes at the too significant missed-opportunity-cost of buying and selling stock. A house rule that would limit players to acquiring a single stock certificate per action would be a good place to start.

Read a fair bit criticizing the game for being essentially all about the stock. Whilst I agree that playing the stock is the central component of winning it certainly doesn't "break" the game for me. It just makes it skewed in a particular direction, which I don't mind at all. The other elements  still come into play, and in fact if everyone is playing the stock market in a similar way they can become be crucial to deciding the victor. It's not in my top ten, but I like the game, like the theme - and it looks gorgeous.

Edit:  12/07/16

So, I've now played the Powering Up expansion twice... and my rating plummets for the base game, which now feels truly exposed as an incomplete design lacking polish, variety, and balance.  Really, I feel burned by the hype of the Kickstarter and equally burned by *not* buying into the expansion Kickstarter.  Once bitten twice shy, as it were... the Powering Up expansion is at least a solid 8, maybe even pushing 9, and it really sucks that it took an additional $50+ to make the game playable as originally intended.

Now I have to decide, do I shell out money for the expansion... or sell my copy of the base game and move on to something else, knowing a friend has both and I can play them if I please through him.

In any case, the original game falls into the "bad" category, with an added .5 simply because it can be saved by the expansion.

***

I'm experiencing the dreaded "play the stock market" problem with this game.  Just don't see how there's any viable alternatives, and it makes the game much less intriguing to me.  I'm eagerly awaiting some kind of fix, and I really hope it doesn't come in the form of an expansion I need to buy.

Really, really want to love this game!

this rating is based off one play of a prototype.  The game is 18xx like with a stock market, stock purchases dividend sales and has a tech tree with patents that you can get paid for.  The game had some issues that the designer was working on.  I really like the idea and concept we shall see.  the theme though was great
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Potentially an enjoyable game (great theme with nice components), but the overbearing rampant stock dump/grabs completely ruins things. Apparently the stock flipping strategy was not playtested, with the designer running a mathematical model instead. There is a serious disconnect here between what the designer intended and what some players are experiencing.

The mechanics are illusory because your efforts on projects and technology will be completely overshadowed by stock market shenanigans. I participated in one session where the winner was last in every single category, except he built the largest stock portfolio that he repeatedly manipulated for the win. This was a very unsatisfying way to end the game.

Exacerbating the situation is stubborn denial from the designer who is once again in a position of irrationally defending one of his games with embarrassing problems. 

Miraculously, an "expansion" then gets offered to address the issues that the critics voiced (whom the designer demeaned, he even sent me a whiny geekmail attempting to censor).

[update] This release ranks as the biggest disappointment of 2015 - three strikes (Road to Enlightenment, The New Science, and now Tesla vs. Edison) and you're out.  I don't see how anyone can have any faith in someone who repeatedly issues such poorly developed products.

This game is set in the late 19th century when electricity is becoming more wide spread.  You are an investor who decide to back one of 5 different inventors and his company.  You compete with other players to build projects to light cities and research light bulb and power transmission technology (AC or DC) for lighting cities.  You also engage in propaganda to increase the public perception of your company and one type of electrical current technology, AC or DC.  Finally, you will need to participate in the stock market, buying and selling shares of your company and your opponents.  The object is to have the best stock portfolio at the end of the game.

I need another play of this one. The actions seem a bit limited given how much there is to do in the game, but I like the stock investment aspect of the game. This one may go up or down depending on how much room for creative play there is. I'm worried it will feel scripted, but that's just a worry. I hope to be pleasantly surprised.

A gripping setting — titans of industry and invention! — kept on course by an excellent system for managing your inventions, patents, fame, and projects, but marred somewhat by its overemphasis of the stock market. An upcoming expansion intends to rectify this, making Tesla vs. Edison the game it deserves to be.

it's definitely a good game but a bit too complicated for my tastes.
In all the game you just make no more than 18 moves... and this seems not much. But it drags for quite a while.
There are definitely different roads to victory and the interest remains quite high for all the game.
Probably much better if no one is in AP and with some more experience.
I could play it again and maybe raise my rating a bit.

High thematic level. Good components (especially money, of course). Art is partly very nice and partly sad and uninspired, dull

I quite like TvE. There are a lot of choices to be made, and value of stockholding at the end of the game determines the winner. I put up a good fight building only two projects (the others in the game built 4 or 5), focussing instead on cash and then share trading. But I forgot you are actually playing a company, and you start with 4 shares in that company that you cannot trade away. My trading weakened my own company too much, and the eventual winner won largely by investing in her own company. But I think a variation of my erstwhile ill-fated 'few projects' strategy might still be viable...

I'm not sure about the idea that you cannot trade away your initial shareholding. It means you have to focus largely on the health of your own company and the other players know it. People seemed to finish with about 10 shares, so those initial 4 are a significant proportion of your final score. That does seem a little limiting and maybe guides strategy a little too much. But after only one play I might be wrong, and I certainly would like to try the game again.

The other thing that's a little cumbersome is calculating the cost of buying a project (which isn't why I didn't buy many projects, honest!). You have to remember that some costs change as the three eras progress, and you have to add a basic cost, a distance cost, a possible cost to use other people's patents, and subtract a possible bonus, all in your head, and all that for multiple possible build sites! 

Is it better than the other shareholding games I've played? Personally, I'd say not. I'd probably rather play the one with the grapes. Or Last Spike! I love that game :) But TvE is good enough that you should play it at least once, and perhaps you might really like it.

Tentative rating with Powering Up!, solitaire 2p (i.e. versus 1 AI). I like what this has to offer! I think this will be very interesting to play against humans, but even the AIs provide stimulating challenge. The most basic (Babbage's) AI in Edison's body tied me in my very first play of the game. That seems like a good challenge, with 6 different companies, and four levels of AI for each!

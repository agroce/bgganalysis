RATING: 10
Fantastic! The best add on to a CLIX game ever. You have to buy this as a fan of heroquest, mechwarrior, mageknight, or a fan of fun in general....

Allows for a dungeon crawl framework to an otherwise "basher" game. Fun fun fun.

The "collectability" is a positive bc there are literally hundreds of monsters on the market for dirt cheap prices that you can bash through the dungeon. Grabbing new heroes is an issue though but they come with the set and you can always get more online or, heaven forbid, buy a booster.

Picked up some miniatures, loved the idea, built a Hirst Arts Dungeon, and then sold it when people saw pictures of it online.  Haven't touched the game since, 'cause it just isn't the same without the gigantic 4'x6' 3D dungeon.

RATING: 6
This is a solid game. The minis aren't so hot, but the other components are fantastic (especially the artifact sets and dungeon builder kits).

I would have loved to have played this game a lot more, but unfortunately none of my friends liked it.

This is one of the better dungeon crawl games out there. The collectible problem/aspect of the game is moot now that it has been discontinued (which means you can get it on Ebay on the CHEAP!).

RATING: 8
This was a variation on standard Mage Knight, a miniatures system that had a lot of promise when it first came out. The "click-based" figure concept was brilliantly conceived but unfortunately tied to a "collectable" marketing/business model and edition/rules tinkering that eventually sunk it.

The "Dungeons" version was more a proper board game along the lines of "Space Hulk" or "Descent" and had a lot of interesting and innovative ideas going for it. I held on to enough of the materials to be able to play happily for years despite the game having been abandoned by its creators. If anything is ever salvaged from the ashes of MK this should be it. I hope it will come back but doubt it very much and if it did re-emerge still as a collectible then I won't go near it...

RATING: 6
Good dungeon crawl game.  Takes a little too long for my taste.  The very high randomness of the treasure chests is needlessly frustrating and I do not enjoy the party vs. party slugfest that happens at the end of most games.  Still, the miniatures are very pretty and the mechanics of the game mesh well with the theme.  Too bad they made it collectible and are now down the slippery slope that marketing plan requires: each new expansion is just a bit more powerful than the previous, so players either have to shell out more money to stay competitive or give up the game.

MKD is a dungeon-crawler spinoff of the regular miniatures game that on its own is pretty ok. However, with extensive hosueruling and and expanded rules that have been created by many of the game's fans, it becomes a really fun game with a lot of really cool exploration.

RATING: 7
Great dungeon crawler game that does away with the maddening "over-RPG-ization" of many in the genre thanks to the self-contained figure stats and fairly simple rules.  Forget teh "collectable" moniker...if you like the starter game, invest in some single monsters and heroes and you're good to go forever, basically.  Artifacts and Dungeon kits add way more life to it.  Negative-side: Setting up the game takes quite a chunk of time, even with the components seperated and organized.  DO NOT think MKD as an extention of MKR...think of it as a board game with optionally collectable pieces. (and on that note, MKR figures don't really work to well here, although they're fully legal)

Collectable miniatures game based on the Mage Knight Rebellion battle game. This version is a basic slash and hack dungeon adventure. Players assemble a team of heroes to enter a dungeon, find treasure and exit with as much as possible. Along the way, they'll encounter wandering monsters from the "mage spawn pool". The excellent thing about this game is all the statistics for the miniatures are recorded on the figure base, and change when the hero takes hits or heals. Wonderful flavour (it feels a lot like the old Games Workshop Advanced Heroquest/Space Hulk games) but without the bookkeeping. Really comes into it's own with the Dungeon Builder and Dungeon Artifacts kits.

Great game with some poor rulebooks.  Some of the rules do not make direct sense until you have read their FAQ or the MK Rebellion rules. Otherwise it's a decently balanced group dungeon crawler where each player is facing off against the others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
At first glance all of this seemed rather impressive.  Lots of cool components, a pretty simple system, objectives with the scenerios and the click mechanism crams a lot of info into one spot.

The click system, while it seems elegant, ends up not being so as you have to constantly refer to the figure for its stats.  Plus, all the special powers get "elegantly" crammed into that little disk and so you have to once again scruitinize the figure and a play aid constantly to keep things strait.

In the end the fiddiliness and the length... oh boy is it long, just doesn't deliver for what's it's doing.  There are vastly better dungeon crawls out there, such as Warhammer Quest or Descent.  MKD has lots of interesting features but in the end they just don't add up to a great system.

One of the "best" Dungeon Crawls. Time beeing it was an absolut 10,0! But WizKids was able to demolish their brand. The figure could still be used in a lot of different games, or you could play still with the old figures (with the old rules...)

Bought

Can be played solitaire. Uses board for movement rather than standard mini style rules. Interesting hidden movement mechanic - you know where the monsters are you don't know what they are until you reach them. All of the good features of Mage Knight. Movement is by squares rather than measurement which I prefer. Mage Knight figures can be used with Dungeons which give you an enormous pool of potential monster to face your heros. IIRC expansion packs had fixed sets of heros, only the monsters were random. Loses 2 points for being
collectibid
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
More like a board game than a minis game.  Fun, though some units are costed strangely.  It can be tough to come up with your own scenarios...most of the ones we've tried to design ourselves have either been cakewalks or players slaughters.

If you can pick this up cheap, I'd recommend it.  Figures are nice looking, and the system is decent.  The little treasure chests are cool.


If you can find resources for scenarios, this would rate better.  I will probably go back and give this another look sometimes.

I have been playing this game once a week (or so) for the last two months. I find it very challenging (since I always seem to get bogged down in MageSpawn -- or never get anything done with my heroes as a I bog down an opponent in MS!). Seems to have replay value. More anon.

Nice dungeon hack based on Mageknight, also it's a little cheaper to get into due to the lack of needing a large army.

RATING: 4
I have played this with my son, since he was about 6 years old. I find it moves a little slowly, as the movement/attack/damage/defence numbers change as you are injured, so you are forever looking numbers up. We ignore the rules and play it as an RPG with miniatures, which is quite good. I really dislike the fact that it is collectible, because that only means that you can't get a decent set of anything. I have spent way too much money on this game, and I have about 3 orcs, so if I want to make a scenario involving a tribe of orcs, I have to do some tricky recycling. We have augmented the game with a homemade outdoor map and some dungeon furniture and so on, which was fun, but it doesn't make the combat any better. Also, some of the mounting of pieces on bases is a little fragile, which makes it practically impossible to use the piece.

We've started using the miniatures for D&D. I don't list it as owned any more because I don't know where the rules are and don't care. It's all about the miniatures.

RATING: 7
It's a compelling package--by far the best dungeon-crawl I've ever played. It does leveling, treasure, class specializations...
I'll admit it: I adore the clicky mechanic. It's an elegant solution to many, many problems previously inherent in the minis genre. Unfortunately, the movement rules suck--ranged combat is too restrictive, and basing someone is very easy. In addition, being unable to walk though your own allies is a) unique, and b) infuriating. 
The expansions and add-ons are really cool. The solo rules are also very enjoyable. I am thus willing to forgive the collectability aspect--especially since I got into after it was dead but before it became hard to find.
[EDIT] It took over ten years, but we finally have a slew of improved dungeon crawls /adventure games on the market. MKD shows its age and is a little too clunky.

I started building a playable Mage Knight Dungeons "DIY dungeon crawler" in January 2012.  So far, I have:

- 2x Heroic Quests (1x Citadel and 1x Magestone Mines)
- 2x Artifact Sets (1x #1 and 1x #2)
- Near-complete set of MK Dungeons (except LE)
- Complete set of Pyramid (except LE)
- Complete set of Dragon's Gate (except LE)
- 12x MK Dungeons starter packs (NIB)
- 4x Rebellion/Conquest Dragons (1x Radiant Light, 1x Polar Ice, 1x Venomous Shadow, 1x Great Fire)
- 2x Conquest Titans (1x Iron Rain Hill Giant, 1x Doom Blade Orc Cyclops; would like Spirit Eidolon Solonavi Celestial).
- 10x Conquest Castle packs (1x Castle Gatehouse, 1x Castle Keep, 4x Castle Wall #1; 2x Castle Wall #2; 2x Tower).

I have lots of extra mage spawn, heroes, and treasure chests.  Just ask!!

A great dungeon crawl boardgame that compares favorably with Descent--while not intended as a cooperative game, there's no reason why it can't be played as such.

I bought this expecting the modern day equivalent of Hero Quest.  The miniatures look great, but the cost and the collectibility aspect are serious turn-offs.  Nevertheless, the rules are interesting, the heros cover a wide spectrum of neat characters, and treasures/artifacts/wandering monsters make for a highly variable dungeon romp that's fun to play.  Not as good as Hero Quest, but better than Warhammer Quest (IMHO).

This game is only fun if you play a scenario, ala Hero Quest.  The standard game rules are for a sort of competitive dungeon crawl, with the players out to screw each other over, and not fun at all.  But throw out the rules, use the pieces in a fun way, and the game has limitless potential!

Don't let the collectibility aspect of this game scare you away.  You can assemble a team of 4-5 heroes for very little money by using Ebay.  All you really need is a team of heroes and a handful of Mage Spawn and you're good to go.  No need to spend a bunch of cash to have fun with this.  Though, if you enjoy the game as I do, there are many ways to spend a bunch of cash to make the game even better.

Our first intro to a dungeon-crawl type game (we play w/100 pt heroes).  The unique 'click' design in the combat dial base containing the attributes of each individual figure is very slick.  The collectibility was not a problem as the individual figures were relatively easy to obtain off eBay.  Game play is straight forward and offers enough variety in control and randomness to make each play a unique one.  

An additional  .5 is given for the 'eerie' enhancements made by the Artifact sets, 3D Dungeon tiles, walls, and traps accessories.

RATING: 6
It a quenches my occasional thirst for a fantasy "dungeon crawl" boardgame without resorting to RPG or need of a GM.  It might be better if one player does play all the monsters.  As long as we agree to not make the dungeon scenario excessively lengthy, it doesn't need to take overly long to get in a good game of it (not that a mega-dungeon or long adventure is lousy).  I like the fact that the MKD Heroes can actually achieve ranks or levels of power (up to 5th level) when a player accumulates "experience points" (gives me the flavor of D&D in my older days).  The modularity of the game tiles to create different scenarios is a plus but the collectible aspect is a turn-off for me.  But I enjoy the game itself every once in awhile (not as a regular game or year long campaign).

A much better way to play Mage Knights. The Dungeon rules were vastly better and the game was thus more fun to play. It was good for multiple friends to join in and some of the official quests released had a lot of thought put into them. Worth looking into, especially if you have a lot of Mage Knight models.

In Mage Knight Dungeons, you take turns moving your Hero through the dungeon to win treasure, defeat monsters and other Heroes, and fight to make it out alive. On your opponent’s turn, you play the monsters who are trying to eliminate his Hero. Along the way your Hero must face the traps that protect the treasure chests, battle monsters and search for the fastest and safest way out of the dungeon.

First impressions: I like it. Some of the bases are a pain the click, but overall I really do dig the clix system. The balance between activating your own units and the monsters felt like it could either be great or drift off into abusable gamey land.

Brilliant among its peers. Best MK game. Vanilla MK was problematic - premeasuring and broken pieces plague it. The grand scale MK game was a failed economic stimulus package.

Good dungeon crawl game. Not DungeonQuest by any stretch, but certainly a good dungeon crawl experience. 

Pick it up on the cheap.

With a few minor house rules, this game really shines.  It's cheap to pick up on ebay, so collectibility is not a problem.  The wide variety of characters makes every game different.  Works well as a solitaire dungeon crawl as well.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

The best of the click-base games, to date.  The beauty of this "collectible" miniatures game is that you need not "collect" more than the common pieces readily available on eBay for pennies on the dollar to have a great variety of parts.  House rules and variants abound (we play a co-operative version) -- indeed, this game only misses a 'Ten' because there are so many variants it can be hard to find agreement on rules.  I HIGHLY reccomend purchasing the dungeon-making kits, with stand-up doors and modular floor tiles for outstanding play, competitive or otherwise.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar rules to Heroclix, with a fantasy bent. The
sculpts are mostly nice and fitting.
Once again, the rules are a bit cumbersome and the clix
powers are hard to determine without constantly lifting
them then comparing to the booklet. 
Solo play is ok but little more than you playing against
yourself...

This is now the only MageKnight our family and friends play.  It is nice not having to use tapemeasure.  Some weird anomolies in rules (being able to switch treasure items between heroes on a turn-by-turn basis even tho they might be a long distance apart), it is still a tight rules system that allows nice strategy, ease-of-play, and interesting re-playability.  I play less now, however, as I find my aging eyes unable to read those tiny numbers and icons on the figures.

I used to be a huge MK collector.  Now all I have is a pretty complete set of the Dungeons game.  After playing a lot of regular MK and MK Dungeons I've much prefered to play Dungeons and have a much easier time finding players.  Plays more like a boardgame and most people I've met don't like having to measure so there's less arguments.  I'm sad to see this game is so underrated considering its the best version of MK in my opinion.

RATING: 9
Good game.  Lots of strategies.  Collectibility is a plus and a minus, depending on your perspective [Plus: More heroes/monster than just a set of 6-12 from a base set, Minus: If you try to collect 'em all - watch out! $$$!!!]  E-mail me if you're looking for trades!

This was a great game when it first came out but they broke it.  Now 2.0 is out and it's supposed to be better but it's too late - I've sold all my stuff and will never buy it again.  Plus it has the word 'collectibe' which is a four letter word in my vocab.

WK shouldn't have marketed the Dungeons spin-off as being randomly collectible.  That element of randomness makes what could/should have been a 20-30 dollar game cost a great deal more (varies, of course), for what isn't really that fun of a game.  And the line about being compatible with regular MK is bull, too, as you'll only use, maybe, 2% of the figures for MK.

RATING: 4
MK Dungeons is an okay use of the Clix system. The game is very different when played on a grid, particularly in a tight quarters dungeon setting. Unfortunately, there isn't much excitement in the official rules as the monsters are generally weak and the treasure run system is a form of multiplayer solitaire. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
There are several flaws with this game.  The rulebook is badly written (clearer rules are available on the website). You have to spend a large amount of money if you wish to buy enough tiles to make a good board, and the tiles tend to warp badly.  The doors will not stand up on their own.  It doesn't play very well 2 player.  Having said the bad stuff, it is a great deal of fun with a group of 4 or more players.  The game has a nice mix of wargame and adventure game to it, and once you get all the rules figured out it plays quite well with a larger group.

The idea that the rules and stats for the figure is on the base, and that the figures come painted and ready to play with is awsome. The rules are simple, but still rather advanced. The biggest downside to Dungeons is that you need to buy quite alot of boosters to have figures enough for a 2-3 or 4 player game. Its very expensive.

I know the game was intended for you to get your own 'set' and then play against other ppl and their 'set' - but I'd like to have enough to play when friends come by who never saw the game before.

Great little game, with the downfall of MK they should have refocused their brand to MK: Dungeons as the tabletop war game ended up losing steam with MK 2.0. I would have loved to see more MK Dungeons kits released as it was something that was easier to get into than the standard MK game. All you needed was a couple of heroes, and a pile of mage spawn to play, and you'd be ready for a great dungeon crawl. I'm actually shocked that when they ended up making MK Resurrection they didn't release a Dungeons oriented kit, as the grid system that MK Dungeons uses is just like Heroclix, and to me had more similarities than the standard open field warfare of MK.

While I liked this dungeon crawl game's square grid for movement as well as its tweaks to the Mage Knight combat "engine", in the end I gave up on it.  

The dungeon hunt and looting aspect just never really worked for me, and the way in which both players moved the monsters back and forth on the map like evil ping pong balls just looked annoying.  I think it would have been a lot better as just a head to head combat game, a better Mage Knight on a map grid, like Heroclix or D&D Miniatures.  But oh well.

Dungeon crawling at its finest.  With a fully customizable board and hordes of figures to choose from the replay value is almost unlimited.   This game is exceptionally modular so it's extremely easy to tweak it to suit almost any number of players and almost any possible dungeon-crawler style you prefer [i](player vs. player, players vs. DM, pure coop, and even solo)[/i].  

There are so many figures available that the initial setup can take a little while, which can be a deterrent when trying to get it to the table, but once there it's well worth it.  

There is a lot of rolling of dice involved in the game, but there are a lot of things that can be done to tweak the probabilities in your favor and reduce their overall influence on the game.

Definitely my favorite game by Wizkids.

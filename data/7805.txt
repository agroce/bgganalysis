RATING: 7
Rating based on 1 play.

Great fun for 7 of us.  I didn't care if I won - just wanted to see the monster eat lots of people!

Update: 2nd play was a lot less fun, as a lot less people got eaten.

I didn't think I'd like this but I do. Avoid too much analysis (particularly with a lot of players because so much hinges on the last person to move anyway) and it can be quite fun.

Nice quick game that plays 8. Not much strategy, but some. The theme is ok, but it is weird that so many people are trying to get through this dungeon. Much blood ensues and often some kingbuilder luck crowns a winner. 

Nice filler between more though provoking games. Good for 1-2 a year.

RATING: 5
I didn't hate this game, but I felt it dragged too much for what is essentially a filler game. And even though you have limited choices, it still had the ability to cause massive AP with some players... which slowed gameplay down to a crawl. 30-45 minutes total game time would bump the rating up a few points.

I find this game MUCH more fun than say Robo Rally which shares some similar mechanics. The theme is well done in terms of graphic design and overall feel. The race element creates tension and we found the advanced rules which include teleporters for the monster to be a nice addition. Overall, you'll laugh and you'll cry. It's a fun gaming experience for 3+ players. I'd worry a bit about downtime with 5+ players.

FF should be played frantically and carelessly with much sound effects of monster stomping/munching. Always allow the start player of each turn to move the monster to make sure everyone gets the rules down and participates in the monster stomping/munching. A good light time.

A Great game if played with a timelimit (10 sec) for every move. This gives the authentic feel of panic.

2016-02-03
In Fearsome Floors you are trying to program the steps of the monster by moving your guys on the board. The trick is that you're not the only player contributing to the code. So it is all chaos. Obviously some players are inherently better at seeing where the monstah goes and thus games are not typically evenly matched. Normally, it would be a great quality to a game if the best player wins, but somehow I do not think it fits a casual game like Fearsome Floors, which in my opinion is all about panic and laughs. Thus I introduced a timer to the game so that even the best players would make mistakes everyone has some kind of a chance to win.

Of course, in an evenly matched table you could play FF very seriously and take your time to ponder. Then it would be a chess match. May the best player win. My choice is to save Fearsome Floors for the casual moments.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's not a bad game it's just that I am not motivated to play it again. The players run on a map from a monster that has some scripted "A.I". There also some "screw-up the others" factor as depending on the moves that we make we may expose some other players for the monster to devour. But somehow it didn't click.

Good fun light game.  A friend didn't like it too much because "it was too much like RoboRally".  My response was to laugh patronisingly in his face.  The only similarity between this game and Roborally is that both involve some spacial computations - the robots contstrained by cards in Roborally, and the monster constrained by very simple rules in this game.  Only if you have extreme problems with the spacial aspects of Roborally could you struggle here . . .

RATING: 7
One of the games that I would recommend for new gamers so as not to overwhelmed them with too many complex rules.

Each player controls 3 or 4 characters in the game who are navigating through a room trying to avoid a monster's wrath.  As long as a player manage to let his total number of characters - 1 escape from the room, the player will have considered to win the game.

Good points: A game that is easy and yet fun to play.  The movements of the monster is "computed" by a clear algorithm which will never have any dispute on how to move the monster.  Tension builds at the second round of play as the monster nears the characters.  A fun game to play with if players are looking for a light game.

Bad points: Possible that the "died" characters will continuously get killed when they revive at the entrance of the boardgame and the monster loiter at the entrance of the board.

Definitely fun and a very neat theme. If there were ever a game that represented the old adage 'the best layed plans of mice and men often go awry' this would be it. Plays better with the stones, teleporters and other goodies and they don't add that much to the rules so skip the basic game.

It's a great game to play where the group consist different age.  Great games for Kid to learn about AI.

I like this a lot. It's more packed than Robo Rally is, and I feel you can still get the monster to the other side of the map to keep somebody from winning.

This one needs another playing.  It has a very "brain burner" feel to it where the monster's actions are known (as long as you can plan far enough ahead...)

{1 play • 6 player} I love the *idea* of this game (and the box cover EC homage), but was surprised at how dull it kind of was.  If everyone plays defensively (like we did), then the monster is essentially neutered.  In our game (18 player discs), only 4 were killed and the game ended quickly (the first flip of the reshuffled deck).  Okay, 3 of the 4 kills were my discs (and yes, I'd like to play again, please), but it seemed fairly easy for everyone else to avoid the monster, and by the end, he was on the "start" side of the board while everyone else was on the "finish" side, with no real way to send him over there.  If people played more offensively (luring the monster), I think I'd enjoy it more... but why should they when the defensive (avoid the monster) strategy works?

Another game I enjoy so much because it offers something unique in moving your pieces around the board and various obstacles trying to avoid a monster which moves on a simple but effective algorithm.

At any given moment you can pretty easily determine where the monster is headed -- only the final distance he travels is random.  But every time someone moves, this path has the potential to change and completely alter the dynamics of the game board.  Safe areas become dangerous and vice-versa.

What's neat is that there are several different tactical ways you can move each of your pieces.  The most obvious is to put them somewhere out of reach of the monster (you hope) so they'll be safe.  But you can also move to exploit the monster's algorithm  in several clever ways to send him on a path that's beneficial to you.  That might be away from some of your vulnerable pieces and/or right at some of your opponent's pieces.

So you have to anticipate how your opponent's will change the board and move your pieces for the best position in the final setup.  In addition, your pieces have different movement speeds on each side and you alternate back and forth by flipping them, so you need to have some plan on what they can do next turn.  You don't want to leave someone with '1' movement next turn out in the open.

The order in which you move your pieces also requires some thought.  Going early allows you to claim a good hiding place since pieces can't stack.  But going late can give you the final say on what path the monster will take.

The game can support some deep calculation -- and analysis paralysis -- which can be a drawback or a benefit depending on how many are playing and what you are looking for.  You can play a slow chess-like game, or you can play it quickly like chase.

What really makes this game for me is the manipulation of the monster movement.  By strategically positioning yourself, you can make sure the monster gets your opponents.  But you can't leave time for your opponents to react.  I really enjoy the game - lots of great strategy to be had.  Unfortunately, my wife doesn't care for it, but what can you do.

Was struck in the game store by the odd-sized box styled to look like an EC comic; that and the f-filled Fairytale on the back convinced me to buy it. A fun game that can get a little mean from time to time. Really glad I got it. Best with a group that really gets into it and doesn't take it too seriously.

Has a bit of a problem in that everyone must gang up two turns before someone is set to win. Still fun, though.

It seems to be quite dependant on player count as to how much strategy there is. With seven playing there were bottlenecks at the start and not a lot places to go.
There also seems to be a distinct difference on how you should play dependant on what position you are in as far as turn order is concerned. Going last leaves you best positioned to direct the monster but you lose out on best places to go.

I was expecting a bit more depth from the dude that made Power Grid, but this is a light, fun racing game with a terrific theme.  The monster movement tiles are even depicted as tombstones!  After a few plays, however, it seems pretty easy to avoid being consumed.  Perhaps using two monsters at once would increase the challenge.  

On a side note, I dislike some of the component production.  My stickers started getting scratched and peeling off the wooden disks, and there are no extra disks for the two additional characters (one being Mr. Friese himself).  I also think a few paintable plastic monsters would've been better than a bunch of cardboard parts.

After a few playings on BSW.  I understand that the game probably moves faster on BSW but it is an enjoyable racing game.   Very simple in movement, yet still requires a good deal of strategy in movement around the board.   I enjoyed trying to hide from the monster while leaving others to fend for themselves.   The modular board creates new challenges each game.

For some strange reason Fearsome Floors appealed to me even before I got to play it.  Was it the theme?  Was it the art?  Was it the alliteration?  I don't know.  I just made sure that I had it on my Christmas list.  I received it and have been able to teach a number of people, including my 6 and 8 year old boys.  It's a very accessible game and can be played with little or no thought.  However, I think lying beneath the surface is a game with a lot more thought and strategy than many may want to admit.  One really has to think spacially, figure out where the Furunkulus is likely to head, and then set up your opponents as the next tasty snack.  An enjoyable ride that doesn't have to take all evening.  [Gift]

RATING: 4
Fun idea, but actually it doesn't work properly. With just a bit of luck you can walk straight to the exit without ever meeting the monster. The game needs a bit more flavor (for example: equipment cards for the characters) and a more inventive game objective.

[COLOR=#959595][SIZE=7]Deutscher Spiele Preis 8th Place 2004[/SIZE][/COLOR]

[i]Posted: 3/25/16, Rated: 7[/i]

I was originally learned [i]Fearsome Floors[/i] on [url=http://www.brettspielwelt.de/Spiele/FinstereFlure/]BSW[/url], although it has since been archived there.  It was a light, fun game that I didn't really understand.  I didn't remember much about it except its quirky name.  Then [i][thing=175878][/thing][/i] was released, and with it a desire to revisit all things [designer=141][/designer].  I wanted to revisit [i]Fearsome Floors[/i], only this time playing it at the table.

Think "B movie horror," and you'll have the right idea about this game's theme.  The players move their character discs on the board, and then the monster moves a certain number of steps according to a simple algorithm.  He looks to the left, to the right, and straight ahead.  If he sees someone, then he walks towards him.  If he sees multiple people, then we walks towards the closest person.  And if he doesn't see anyone, then he continues walking straight ahead.  The monster reevaluates his next move after each step.

This algorithm can be exploited, and herein lies the real fun in this game: it is possible to lure the monster towards one of your characters, and in so doing have him see an opponent's character that was previously safe.  Om, nom, nom!  It's a devlish delight seeing your doppelganger devoured in such a fashion.

It also makes [i]Fearsome Floors[/i] the only [b]indirect[/b] programming game I know.  Games like [i][thing=18][/thing][/i] or [i][thing=126239][/thing][/i] allow you to program your robot directly.  You can't program Furunkulus, but you can influence where he goes, and it is very satisfying.

[i]Fearsome Floors[/i] is thus a light game that can nevertheless surprise you with thinky problems.  Should I unerringly advance towards the exit, or should I take a turn to be safe and then move?  The artwork is perfectly campy to match the B movie theme.  It's a game that doesn't take itself too seriously and yet still delivers some good tension.

This is one of those games that seem to work best for online play. The turnbased implementation on Yucata is highly enjoyable. When played live I only find this to be an OK game that is not involved enough to be really fun. Certainly not the best of FF. Nice game to play if you're looking to really annoy your friends.

Everyone enjoyed this one.  I had some doubts before playing, but it was a lot more fun than I expected based on the rules and the description.

RATING: 6
Fearsome Floors is a light game that keeps what little it promises: an hour or so of thoughtless diversion. It’s an eurogame in its core so don’t expect much from the theme and even less from the setting, even though you can feel some effort by the author to develop them both, which is something extraordinary for such a game. [i](December 2011)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I haven’t been playing Fearsome Floors for a long time and even after so many years it still lacks any attractive on me: hence, during my Fall 2015 rating revise I rounded down my rating, waiting for the next actual play to fully re-evaluate it.

A race game where if you come in last...YOU DIE.  With stakes like that what's not to like?  Well some people will over-think the hell out of this game.  It's a simple, silly race game that is meant to be played fast.  If people are taking longer than 30-60 seconds with their turns I'd implement a timer.  That being said, everyone I play with loves this one.  People like building the monster and the artwork overall is very well done.  I enjoy this one quite a bit with family and friends.  It's not something I'd break out with seasoned players.

Very entertaining game that can be a bit of a brain burner at points - but its not too hard usually.  And you get to build a monster.

Kind of feels like "Roborally lite".  Plays really well with 3-4 players.  With more I imagine it becomes more of a party game.

RATING: 6
The puzzly aspect is neat, but at larger numbers of players (which it feels like it was meant to play at) it feels pretty random. You dont seem to get far enough on your turn, maybe? Dunno, very clever, but ends up less fun than it seems it should be, for me. (Fast Flowing Forest Fellers is a great replacement, though. Loving it.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, and supports a large number of players.  You [i]must[/i] keep the game moving, or it will quickly wear out its welcome.

One player I was with thought overly long, and in fact would make suggestions to other players [i]after[/i] they had decided on their moves, making them rethink all over again.  My speedy encouragements fell on deaf ears.

Get a sandtimer and stick with it!  Don't give them a break even in their first game.

Played this one on a game evening for boardgame clubs organised by Hodin, June 2005.  For me there was too randomness in the game.  Perhaps my rating is also influenced by the fact that a rule was forgotten : play order stayed the same all the time where it should change, hence the session was very unbalanced as the player last in turn always had a 100% exact view on the path the monster would follow (needless to say this player won the session easily like this).

This was a bit goofy... don't quite know how I feel about it yet, but I can't say I'm sold on it at this point. Our first game turned out to be fairly cooperative, with players carefully working out in advance where the monster was going to end up - it would have been a lot more fun and spontaneous if people just went with it and didn't analyze too much! Perhaps this is a good candidate for a timer.

Not a bad Halloween game, though, if you have a theme thing going.

I think I like the movement of the monster more than I like the playing of the game.  Unfortunately, because every person gets to move before the monster does, the person who last moves can negate all strategy everybody else set up.

(1 play) Highly luck dependent, indirect player interaction only, not much brainwork needed. On the plus side there's some tactics involved and the game offers great opportunities for some nice trash talk.

don't be scared off by the weird description and blood stains.  it's actually an intelligent and clean game.  this has a similar feel as robo rally, but it's non-confrontational and less chaotic.  for me, that means a game that's more fun.  it plays fast, and it's okay even with just 2 or 3 players (whereas robo rally is rather bland with few players).  the theme is well-implemented, and this is a perfect halloween  game to pull out in october.

An excellent game for parties and larger gaming groups. Players play against the game itself and eachother as they try to move their pieces past the fearsome monster and escape the game.

Finally, a FF game I can heartily endorse!  Has all the elements many of his other games do (randomness, semi-scripted game elements) but they actually work together!  The monster movement is a great example of how scripting can be really effective in a board game.  Also scales incredibly well - I probably wouldn't want to play this with more than 4, as it would take longer than it's worth.  This is hardly the dumb party game I was expecting, there is a lot to like here, and plenty of replay value.  Still, though, methinks FF has more style than substance.

Funny and enjoyable with a solid amount of strategy and a gnarly theme. Better with more people I think as it's more chaotic and crazy. Only thing I dislike is the game's susceptibility to AP. When it moves along quickly it's good fun, when it doesn't it's a bit of a bore.

It's ok, but doesn't excite me to much. It is more fun with many players, but then again, there is always a slow player among them. I'd rather play ricochet robots instead. However, Fearsome floors has a nice design and funny pieces.

RATING: 6
There is such a disjoint in this game between the game I see (a funny haha he's coming to get you game) and the game I play (carefully calculate your move so that the other players can't get the monster to target you and you can direct the monster towards them by moving bricks or ducking around or whatever game).

The player count is rough as well. The game really drags with five or more players, because with all there is to calculate on your turn (and you can't do it before your turn, or not much) the game is really AP prone.

I really wanted to like this game! I love the theme, the art is adorable, but the mechanics are just plain boring. It didn't feel as tense as it seems it should. I've only played with 3 players and 1 monster, so perhaps it livens up with more. However, I was so disappointed that I just traded it.

This was not as much fun as frustrating.  This is perhaps my least favorite game by this designer.  I see how there is some strategy involved, but basically this is a race game with quite a bit of randomness.  

I can see how this game would be popular with some, but it just didn't do it for me.

RATING: 8
Played with six, four of which were newbies. Since there were more new players, we didn't experience a lot of "screwage" factors. A bit, but mostly coincidental or accidental.. not really thought out. I think a game with more experienced players will be more exciting and fun, once I've got another learning game under my belt. Wonderful theme, great artwork.. my wife loves that you can customize the monster to several different themes. I do wish there was a bit more art to the player pieces. I definitely want to play again, to get to play some rougher nastier games as well as to experience the "advanced" version with the varied action blocks. I agree with Mark and Joe that a move timer may be necessary for some games - I can see how analysis paralysis could be a problem here.

Players must maneuver their people through the dungeon trying to manipulate the movement of a monster who is always after fresh prey. Players can try to lead the monster to opponents' pieces, but may find themselves eaten instead! Pieces might slide along blood slicks or be crushed between a boulder and a wall. You can even try to get the monster to teleport to another part of the board, where it will fall upon its next victim!

Cute game.  Reminds me very slightly of Ricochet Robots, although that game is probably better as a puzzle.

Not one I'll play a lot, but one I'll keep for a while and see how it fares.

The theme is the thing. The components are nice, the artwork fits...and the game is nicely finite. In other words, its easy to see how close to the end things are getting. Its certainly not a heavy game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Light-hearted, yet evilly tactical game. The game play, particularly at the advanced level can lead to some nasty monster leading and chaotic death strings, and the game does a decent job bridging the gap between 'deadly serious' advanced games and 'light to the point of insanity' ones (though larger scale does become insanely chaotic, but without more people the game loses something). Nothing that I'd feature as the 'heart' of a session, but a perfect opener/closer, especially because of the fast set-up.

The main danger present here is AP prone players. The monster moves in a programmed way, so there is a temptation to plan out everything carefully, which can slow the game down. This wouldn't be a problem if the planning actually served some purpose, but each player controls 4 pieces, so things can be changed around a lot by the time the end of turn actually comes. I try to remind players of this so that they don't try to plan out too much until they get to the 3rd and 4th piece movements. Played quickly this is a fun medium length filler with no randomness, just player created chaos, and I like that.

RATING: 5
I wish it were more monstery...the theme is there but pretty shallow.  Still, it's a charming game (love sliding around in blood and organs) and if you bring your own fun (i.e. comments of questionable taste and decency) it can be good fun. The artwork is terrific.  Not the THREE HOUR GAME some detractors have made it out to be!

I'm giving this game a 6.5 because for families its a 8 but for my regular group it would probably be a 6. The game pulls off what it intended. This is a great lite family game. I've played this 4 times with my 6 year old son. He's won 3 of the games and almost beat me the last time. My wife and I had to give him some help but its a great game with a great theme. In regards to your usual gaming friends it should still be pointed out there is almost no luck in this game so it still has room for strategy and some devious plays.

Strangely, this may be my favorite Friedman Friese game.  Or at least it's close to Power Grid (which I probably like a little better), but this one has that classic FF feel to it.  DON'T let people get bogged down in analysis.  Break out the sand timer if need be.

RATING: 7
A light game with lots of alliteration that takes 2-7 players.  Players seek to move their set of tokens through a fortress while hiding behind stones, sliding on blood pools, and avoiding a monster who eats them!  Additional floor tokens add other challenges.  Tokens may be laid out differently each time.

It was okay with our first play of 2 but we agree that it'll be better with more players and more mayhem.

Ideally very fast-paced, but there's definitely some room for AP.  Not quite as easy for people to immediately grasp as I'd hoped either, but still a pretty good gateway game.  Very simple concept, but executed in a somewhat complex way.  Everyone should get a turn controlling the monster, since that's the best way to get a feel for how he moves.

RATING: 6
The theme and components are fun, but I recognize this as a real abstract puzzle.  

The goal is to try to predict where your opponents will move and then guard against the monster's potential moves.  Although you're always heading towards a single location, your choices can be tough - sometimes it's best to backtrack or sacrifice a pawn.

This game isn't bad, and I'll be happy to keep playing it on Yucata.  But it's not for my collection right now.

A choice Halloween game. Light, quick, and fun, and I can see the potential for a very strategic game with the right group of players.  But even with a non-gaming crowd, this works very well. My 4-year-old  is able to play it, although my only complaint is that the blood pools might be a little gruesome for younger kids.  Removing them from the game when kids are playing, however, does not ruin the experience. And I like to say, "Furunkula!" over and over.

For a design about a marauding homicidal monster, this is actually a remarkably dry game of spatial reasoning. A time limit is a must, as otherwise play devolves into a kind of analytical negotiation. But even with a timer, there is a distinctly unpleasing clash between the theme and the transparent nature of the monster's movement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a good filler game that should be played with a timer or with a drinking component. I get a kick out of the components and enjoy the light natured fun that this game creates. I think it should be cheaper, but it's a fun idea and i would recommend it to balance out your collection...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: Quality tokens, props, and board. Disturbing yet theme-appropriate art.

Experience: Silly fun. Basically just a mad dash for the door. A few moments arose when players deftly lured the monster toward other players, but mostly the entertainment came from seeing where the monster goes in reaction to our many unrelated moves.

[Oct 2017] - 7.25 (3 plays)
Random, light rules, a whole lot of take that and a comic Halloween theme. I love this game in the same vein as Betrayal at House on the Hill - you play just for fun and don't worry too much about losing. Might at this to my collection at some point. I can see at lower player counts the game becoming very nasty as there is only one other player to throw under the bus. Played 3 heats with 5 players each.

[29 Aug 2017] - 7 (4 plays)
Played a copy I recently picked up to get the rules explanation down and try it out on my wife in anticipation of Halloween. Surprisingly little amount of randomness as each disc selected for play, movements and the algorithm of the monster is fixed. The only random part is how many spaces the monster will move. Very unforgiving to other players if you want to play to win, just like escaping from a real dungeon. The game plays so fast I don't mind the take that and the chaotic nature of the game. A keeper to bring out to fall parties instead of werewolf or playing another game of passphrase.

2-7 Jugadors
El joc és competitiu. Cada jugador controla un equip de 4 personatges. És una cursa per fer-ne escapar tants com puguis abans que els altres, i abans que siguin menjats pel monstre que ocupa la mazmorra. El monstre és 'estúpid' i es mou en línia recta (però sempre mirant als costats) i quan veu un o varis objectius, es dirigeix cap al que té més a prop.
Al principi no ho sembla, però és un joc molt 'estruja-cervells', has de pensar bastant i comptar les 'passes' que pots fer i les que el monstre farà...
Està bé, però a mi se'm fa pesat haver de comptar les passes i contemplar les rutes de pas.

---------------
Date: 2003

Quand je suis allé au salon d’Essen, la Mecque des jeux de société, je m’étais promis de ramener des jeux jouables à six joueurs et je suis revenu avec une boite de Finistere Flure sans avoir eu d’avis préalable. Il faut dire que la boite est immédiatement attirante avec son design de vieux comics écornés qui constitue déjà une promesse à se fendre la gueule entre amis. Rien d’étonnant donc que Finistere Flure soit la première boite ouverte à mon retour en France.

Le jeu

Chaque joueur à quatre personnages ( trois à partir de quatre joueurs) qui ont eu le malheur de s’aventurer dans une crypte, pour s’en sortir pas d’autre solution que de traverser toute la grille du plateau et rejoindre la sortie. Mais vous n’êtes pas seuls, l’abominable Furunkulus, un monstre en quête de pitance, rôde et guète les infortunés qui passent à sa portée.
Il s’agit donc d’un jeu de course où le gagnant est le premier joueur à amener trois (deux à partir de quatre joueurs) de ses personnages en lieu sûr. Un tour de jeu se déroule de la manière suivante, les joueurs déplacent leurs pions puis le monstre se déplace. Chaque personnage est un pion à double face blanche et noire qui indique un potentiel de mouvement, si on additionne la valeur des deux faces le résultat est toujours 7. Après chaque déplacement le pion est retourné et ne peut être redéplacé qu’au tour suivant. Les joueurs vont déplacer un après l’autre un de leurs personnages jusqu’à ce que tous aient été déplacés. Le monstre va ensuite se déplacer selon un jeu de tuiles qui peuvent être soit un nombre de cases à parcourir soit faire une ou deux victimes dans la limite de 20 cases! Le monstre à un mode de déplacement particulier, sur chaque case de son parcours il regarde à droite, à gauche, devant lui et se dirige vers la victime la plus proche. Mais il est un peu limité niveau QI et si, sur sa droite et sur sa gauche il y a deux victimes à égale distance, il ne peut pas se décider et continuera tout droit. De même si aucun personnage n’est visible il avancera tout droit.
Le jeu se joue en deux parties, lorsqu’il ne reste qu’une tuile de déplacement à Furunkulus, la seconde partie débute en remélangeant les tuiles précédemment jouées. Pendant la première partie, chaque personnage éliminé revient en jeu au début du parcours, après leur sort sera définitif.

Pour corser la difficulté, le terrain réserve quelques bonnes surprises, flaques de sang glissantes, pierres derrière lesquelles il est possible de se cacher, passages secrets réservés au monstre qui lui permettent de resurgir à l’autre bout du plateau lorsqu’il se dirige droit dans le mur. Les pierres peuvent être poussées par les personnages à condition qu’il n’y ait rien derrière par contre le monstre bien plus fort peut écraser un personnage en poussant une pierre contre le mur.
Dans la version avancée du jeu, les pierres imposent une direction au monstre quand il les atteint, tourner à droite ou rebrousser chemin, d’autres pierres encore sont transparentes. Deux portails de téléportation (réservés au monstre, rien n’est épargné aux personnages) sont également fournis.

Variante

Pour augmenter les possibilités de coups foireux j'ai remplacé 3 pierres par 4 miroirs à deux faces orientés selon la diagonale de la case. Ces miroirs fonctionnent comme des pierres (il est possible de les pousser) et ils réfléchissent l'image des jetons selon la perpendiculaire, à condition que le trajet jeton-miroir soit sans obstacles. Le monstre avec son intelligence limitée prend les images pour des proies, il est alors possible de le diriger à distance par le jeu des miroirs et de l'attirer vers d'autres proies bien réelles.

Mon opinion

Ce jeu est mon coup de cœur d’Essen 2003. C’est un des rares jeux qui arrive à réunir ambiance et tactique, pour s’en rendre compte il suffit de voir une tablée de Finistere Flure. Tantôt sérieux, tantôt hurlant «Aaargh, au monstre !!!» les joueurs prennent un plaisir évident qui tient à la fois au thème, au matériel et au coté prédictif du jeu. Finistere Flure n’est certes pas très stratégique mais une fois que l’on à compris l’algorithme de déplacement du monstre les coups tactiques pleuvent. C’est réjouissant de faire coucou au monstre pour l’attirer vers une proie plus proche de lui. Méfiez vous car certains joueurs -surtout dans la première partie du jeu- n’hésitent pas à effectuer des missions suicide et se jeter dans la gueule du loup rien que pour vous embêter, les vilains! Le dernier joueur à déplacer un personnage est donc privilégié, ce n’est pas un défaut, il faut juste penser à en tenir compte. 
Comparé à Roborally dont la mécanique est semblable, le jeu gagne en fluidité et en rapidité. Un joli coup de la part de Friedmann Friese qui confirme sa notoriété croissante.
A mon avis Finistere Flure réussi un bon équilibre idéal entre fun social (jusqu'à 7!), accessibilité et intérêt ludique. Nul besoin d’attendre Halloween pour vous l’offrir !

Finstere Flure is a thoroughly well done game.  It is incredibly thematic for what is essentially an abstract.  From the fantastic Vault of Horror graphic design to the build-it-yourself Furunkulus, this game just oozes gruesome charm.  With plenty of opportunity for screwage and analytical play, FF is one of my favorite games of 2004.

Ik vind het wat saai. Net als in het vergelijkbare roborally loopt iedereen wat doelloos rond. Misschien is dit spel in real life wel fun en lachen, maar online kwam dit spel niet echt tot zijn recht. Daarom geef ik dit spel een onvoldoende. Of het spel leuker is in real life zal ik waarschijnlijk nooit te weten komen, want ik zal het zeker niet aankopen.

Rating based on the using a 5 or 10 second rule (thats how much time you have to move your piece). This game drags if you let people analyse it too much, but is a real hoot if people play at a fast, panicing pace. (Fearsome Floors)

As unique as it is, the game ought to be more fun, and I'm not sure what the problem is. Perhaps it's that you have less control than you think. Perhaps it's that you wait too long while others contemplate their moves. Maybe I should try it with fewer players.

Unimpressive.  Too little control.  Seems like the monster can only take on one side of the board at a time.  If you're on the other side, well, you're set.  Do not play this with 7, it's really bad.  UPGRADE.  Better with 2 players.  Might be better with 3.

Cool idea with lots of room for subtle manipulation of the monster's programmed movement.  Lacks the tension its design promises and suffers for it.  Probably needs more players to shine.  Final thoughts pending a game with 5 or more players.

This game tricks you into thinking you have some control over your destiny.  I ended up spending too much time trying to figure out what I should do.  In the end, chaos reigns supreme.

RATING: 6
A fun romp where players are trying to exit their playing pieces from a dungeon/haunted house.  Players take turns to move their pieces across a large room.  After all pieces have moved, the monster lurches around, follwing a simple set of movement rules, trying to find pieces to eat.  Blood pools, push-able stones, and advanced rules can create some tricky tactical situations.  Good game, great presentation!

Fun little puzzle game.  The problem is, the more you think about your moves, the better you'll do, but the less fun you'll have.  Implement a (short) turn timer!

I've ended up playing this a couple times around Halloween for the last couple years, and it's always been with 5+ players.  Each time I am left with the impression that the game would be better with fewer, but have yet to try it that way.

I've been wanting to play this for a long time.  It's the kind of game that just looks like it should be fun.   Cool box, cool art, cool board, cool build-your-own monster.

Only had one play of this and it was with 6 players and using the basic rules.  I got this game with the plans to play it with large groups (6 - 7).  I feel for large groups the game is rather chaotic and a little too long when you consider the player elimination.  I hear it's a lot more strategic with the advanced rules and with less players, which I could agree with.  That being said, there are many other games I'm sure I would rather play with a lower player count.  I also think there are few better games with a larger player count as well leaving it dusty on my self until I can trade it for something else.

Frunkulus' moving mechanic is downright elegant. A fun, light puzzle style game with an awesome theme. Customizable levels make the game highly replayable and makes for easy difficulty adjustments.

I don't think I'd play this again without some type of timing function, a little too shallow for a thinking game - not that there's anything wrong with that.

Who doesn't like the theme of running and hiding from a monster while arranging for other people to get attacked and killed? Especially when you get to push pillars and slide on blood pools? It plays high player counts well too. Not to be taken too seriously though better players can foresee monster moves and react better -- unless the rest of the table conspires against them, that is. Good, silly fun with elements of spatial movement and push-your-luck.

Based on 36 plays with 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 players.
+ Playing this game is fun.
+ It works almost equally good with any number of players.
+ There is some exciting interaction between players (that is, luring Furunkulus to feast on the foe-players' friends).
+ Can be played both as a light or a medium-heavy game.
+ Monster kit.
+ The style is thoroughly cartoonish, which I personally like.

> Components are of regular good quality.
> Modular board adds a bit of variety.
(> Front cover guy looks like a friend of mine. That's you, Joni.)

- Waiting times may be long with seven players, in particular with long-thinking opponents (not happened yet).
- There is little control over the game play with many (6, 7) players.
- The ending condition is not quite as elegant as I expected. (We have even played with a scoring method of our own a few times, but we never considered the ending condition to be the main point in this game.)

An underrated gem. It's silly and entertainingly mean. I have it to play with family around Halloween time.

It does need the players to play quickly, though, otherwise it can overstay its welcome. But while clever play is part of the fun, in my opinion it shouldn't be overthought anyway, so _normally_ this shouldn't happen.

Rating history: 8...|9|8...|7...

Played 14+ times with 2-7 players for 7+ hours.

I rate the base game a 6 and the advanced game a 7 or 8 depending on player count.

JUN/05. RATE 8. Played 5+ times. Partly a race game, partly bizarre, with a dime-novel horror theme on top. Players have 3 or 4 characters that they must move from one corner of the board to the other, but that dratted super zombie monster is stalking...stalking us all!!! Fun trying to evade the monster by hiding behind stones or racing past him when he's facing the other way. Even more fun when you cleverly manuever him towards your opponents. Great race game that is not straight forward but quite interactive and almost puzzle-ish. Right now, with novelty value, great art, and player range of 2-7 players. // With advanced rules, the game gives you even more to think about since the monster can now teleport! And this makes the game more fun too since the monster can now cover more space quickly.

DEC/12, RATE:8. Played 2 times with 2 players. Just as good as I remember, and still good with 2 players. (Advanced version only. Basic version is way too simple.)

AUG/14, Rate: 7. The basic game is a 5 for me now (monster movement just not interesting at all), while the advanced game is almost an 8. We'll call it a 7.

This is a light little game that gives surprises and chuckles.  The monster theme with blood and gore is always a draw and game mechanics use the theme well (slide on the blood slick; the monster is stupid and follows a zombie-kind of path, and he is stronger than the other players.) The players hide behind dungeon walls and each other, trying to escape and win the game.

A fun romp. It's fun trying to figure out ways to make the monster eat your opponents, but even though the monster's movements can be calculated, you never know exactly where he'll end up.

Escape from the the torture dungeon!  This game is great with two, but even better with four or five.  The game has a surprisingly high level of strategy to it (although it is by no means heavy or a brain burner) and has some of the best suspense of any game I've played. I love this game, so do my kids and so does my game group.  I like this game so much I almost bought Power Grid, depite how comparatively dry it appears, since Friese designed both.  Then I sobered up.  I know people love Power Grid, but these games are night and day apart.  I am certainly not saying you can't love both.

Not really my cup of tea, hence the low rating.  Were I giving a rating for the design then I'd give it about a 6 - clearly, it works, it has some nice mechanisms, but it's all a bit random for my tastes, so it only scores a 2 for enjoyment; hence my final wimp-out rating of 4.

Try to hide your own meeples from the monster while pushing others into plain view (or rather pulling down the blanket they hide behind) so they get eaten/gruesomely mutilated/tickled to death or whatever it is that a monster does.

FINSTERE FLURE ist eine Art zombieiertes, thematisch getrashtes und weit entfernt verwandtes ROBO RALLYE durch ein graues Labyrinth, in dem jeder Spieler drei seiner vier Familienmitglieder von einem Eingang schräg gegenüber zum rettenden Ausgang bringen muss ohne dabei von der Patchwork-Pappkreatur mit dem Auge der Avantgarde-Band "The Residents" erwischt und gefressen zu werden. Die flüchtenden Verwandten durch das Grauen treten sich ganz schön auf die Füsse. Das ist erstmal gut. Doch FINSTERE FLURE spielt sich weniger bauchig als es der spaßige Kontext vermuten lässt: gewiefte Spieler überlegen nämlich ihre Züge ganz genau und lassen die mathematische Fundament des Werks erahnen. Der Weg des Monsters lässt sich auf Gegenspieler steuern. Steinsäulen, Blutlachen und Teleporter in der dunklen Halle sind nur Variable in einem mathematischen Koordinatensystem. Wir erinnern uns sehnsüchtig an VERLIESS von Parker Spiele.

One of our favorites. Even though it is pricey, replay value has been high in our house so it was worth the money. The components have great graphics and are of high quality - be very careful when putting the stickers on the game pieces (I am glad I didn't let my kids do it) because they are two-sided and there are different values for each side and it matters which values are on each side of the same piece.

FF is cute and you can definitely get into the monster chasing everyone around. Maybe a bit of an unfortunate thing - but the way the map was set out and the position of the players, ol' Mr. Monster chased his tail for awhile while everyone was able to sneak closer to the door. Not really quite sure of any long-range strategy. I wish there was some way to tempt the monster to go after other people. I guess you could try and sacrifice one of your players so that the Monster will perhaps eat someone else, but not sure how balanced of a strategy that would be. Highly tactical in the end, but I don't think FF tries to be more than it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You can play this game two ways - as a thinking game where you take as much time as you want, or as a fun game where you move quickly and hope the monster eats someone else. I think it will work for both types of audience. Lost a point due to analysis paralysis in what's supposed to be a fun game.

It's got monsters, scared kids, slippery bloodstains, and ways to screw your opponents (basically, bait the monster). Can be taught in 5 minutes and the game length is just right for the amount of fun. What more can one ask for in a game? :-)

RATING: 5
I find myself enjoying this more, the more I play.  I agree with others that implementing a timer does much for the pacing of the game, and adds a wonderful dynamic of chaos - which a game such as this should have.  Playing with the warps, and turning stones just makes the game better.  Although lighter fair, Fearsome Floors is a great time.

UPDATE: 
This game has lost a little of its shine for me.  It can still offer a fun outing, but I think that is more dependant on the people I am playing with.

The monster is an a$$hole.

This was more fun with more people -  as long as the pace isn't too slow.  Playing at a rapid pace adds to the feeling of frantically fleeing from a monster.  Overanalyzing your possible moves is a game killer.

One of the most underrated games I've gotten my hands on. Most gamers dismiss it for a wild & wacky monster game, which it is, but the underlying complexity is easy to miss.

Easy to learn but tricky to grasp. It feels a little bit like Roborally-lite in the sense that it is a race, something can happen that sends you back (or outright perish)and the board can have all kinds of obstacle.  

After more playings I now call this Fearsome Boredom.  Since the monster moves in specific ways the game becomes far to prone to over analysis of move and counter move.  For the theme and light-ness, it should have a little more chaos buit into it. That would speed it up too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I love this game.  Definitely play with the advanced rules, but the basic rules are excellent for first-timers.  The unpredictability of Furunkulus' movement spaces is great, but there is a lot of room for strategy as well.  The customization of Furunkulus makes the game even better.  Make sure you play with the house rule that you must start moving immediately when it's your turn, and you cannot take a movement space back.

A fun game where the monster just tries to eat everyone in sight!  In the first part of the game, you come back if you get eaten.  Later on , you stay dead.  Since at the time of writing I have only played this game once my comment will be a little naive and immature.  There is a huge novelty factor in this game.  Spatial awareness comes into this game in a big way but it is by no means as mentally taxing as Ricochet Robots.  You just have fun.  I guess as you play it more, there will be a lot of strategy involved and it will become more of a challenge.  But at the start it's just fun to see your stiched-together monster lurching after anyone in line of sight.  I thoroughly recommend this game.

Bought as part of a bulk deal in April 2014. Not as exciting as I had hoped.

With few players the monster seems a bit too easy to avoid. With many players, there is more satisfying (and tension-inducing) carnage - but there is one overriding problem: the last player in each round is often the only one who can really take advantage of the mechanic and cleverly screw another player. Just sprinting to the end is usually the best tactic. It's the kind of game you'll be itching to house-rule because it seems just on the brink of being really fun (and because the rules as written/translated are not entirely clear).

Sold in November 2014.

Our first play was just with 3 players and that made the a bit too much chess-like to my taste. There is still luck, like I found out in a bad way... but it makes the game a bit more interesting to me. I like this though, but I think, I would rather play it with 4-5 players.

Based on two plays I've adjusted the score downward a bit. Yes, it's a fun game, but both games I've played ended the same way--rather abruptly. With a number of character tokens clustered in the middle of the board and some near the exit, we realized that one person was going to win easily by getting the last token through the exit on her next play. At that point, there was no sense in continuing since it would've just been a lot of irrelevant token moving and flipping.

We had fun moments in the early part of the game when Forunkulus went on an eating binge. To have some fun in the middle only to have it end with a whimper like that was just disappointing.

A thoroughly enjoyable and amusing game with some surprises. It's yet another simple-to-play game that has more tactical depth than one expects at first glance. The only disappointment for me was that our first game ended rather abruptly when one player got two tokens out of the dungeon. This player had just gotten one character permanently eaten, while some of us still had all three tokens, two in play and one out of the dungeon. But, I suppose the object is simply to get the required number out. It's not about getting them all out alive.

The wacky gothic theme, the whimsical art, the simple turns - all of these are crying out for a game that's fast, zany, and unpredictable. The problem is that the game design doesn't really emphasize any of those three qualities. This is a game that actually needs to be more chaotic. The theme asks players to play quickly and without too much thought, approaching Finstere Flure as a very "light" game. But the game's systems ask players to think carefully about their moves.  The way to get ahead involves observing and manipulating the monster's path.  So when played to win, Finstere Flure turns into a game of visual analysis and planning.  A mostly uninteresting game of visual analysis and planning, with a theme that doesn't match the gameplay.  If Finstere Flure wants to be a breathless scurry to the other side of the dungeon, it needs to do more to undermine the effectiveness of this sort of planning.

I don't like this game. There are 2 ways to play it. The first way is very fast with nobody thinking too much, just racing for the exit. The monster moves around and kills people randomly as it runs over them. You don't get to make any interesting choices, you just move around and hope to not get eaten.
The second way is with people calculating every move of their guys and where the monster is going. This slows the game down to a crawl and there is not enough game here for this to be anything other than a quick filler.
I find this mindless and boring and traded away my copy.

Robo Rally light wouldn't hit the nail on the head as there are more differences comparing those games as there are commons. But it seems that the target group is the same as for the traits those two games have in common (moving characters on a grid avoiding loosing one's life). Funny if played rather quick but it is prone to players with AP which can make the game drag. Just simply add a sand-timer to avoid this so you can even play this with larger groups.

A lot better and more strategic than I was initially expecting.  It's easy to learn, and extremely interactive.  Plus, the theme makes sense and is quite entertaining.  A slow group kills this one, though.

This game needs to be played with all the special items. It's not worth playing without them. Also, a time limit for each player enhances it quite a bit by giving people less time to plot. Lots of fun with the right crowd.

It's an amusing game with a fun theme but in my experiences it has usually had some AP problems and almost always led to a kingmaker situation.

RATING: 6
This is a fun little racing game where you have sneak past a monster to reach the finish line. The divided movement values of the characters require good tactical planning and give the game an almost abstract strategy feel, but the randomized and labyrinthine movement of the monster adds a great element of chaos and tension while still being just predictable enough to possibly pull off cool maneuvers that lure the monster into going where you want it to. The production values are rather cheap, but with a cool b movie style (you even get parts for multiple different monsters that you can combine however you like) and you also get lots of unique obstacles that really take the tactical gameplay to the next level.

Played it over the New Year Weekend and we thought it was a lot of fun.  we played 4 games in total...3 with the "basic" rules.  We tried one game with the "advanced" rules.  And there were requests to play with more than one monster.  Fun game!  Have played several more times and my family likes it.  I'm not very good...I tend to lose a lot.

RATING: 5
For some reason I thought this one would come out more often and end up being more fun.  After multiple plays it seems to fall flat for me.  Ended up trading this away for something that will hit the table more often.  It's not a bad game but as my collection grows, there isn't room for games I find so-so.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
fun simple game.  Can be annoying when you are playing with someone that takes it seriously, yet can't see the way the monster moves.  It should be played with people that can look at the board and follow where the monster 'should' go.  Of course that's before you start screwing each other with placement of your pieces.

A really good light game with excellent theme and fantastic components.  Our session was prone to analysis paralysis but I think the game would be more fun with less of that.

Két próbajáték után leesett, hogy is kell pontosan játszani. Minden kör után visszafordítottuk a szines oldalukra a bábukat.

Great art and bits elevate this good game to a great one.  The movement system takes a little while to master, but you can have all kinds of sneaky, backstabbing fun once you've got the hang of it.  I still need to try the advanced "stones" to see how they spice things up.

Great fun.  Played it many times over many years and still wish to play more.  Friese is a quality designer with serious breadth to be able to do this and Power Grid.  The monster movement rules are still some of the best AI in any board game.  And sabotoging each other in clever ways is one of my favorite gaming activities.

I've played this game a handful of times, and I've had fun with it even though I haven't been able to win.  They've mostly been "learning" games, but now I have a nice base of people that know how to play.  One great thing about this game is that it's very easy to learn.  I've had a problem trying to get too tricky by doing things like using my pieces to bait the monster.  Be careful to either play with a group that doesn't suffer from AP or make sure that people move quickly.  Definitely better when played fast and loose.

I really like the game's atmosphere. The tension builds up as the players move, and it becomes clearer where the monster is going to go. I see how the 2 monster variant can make the game better: there's no good way of making 'safe' moves when two monsters are on the prowl!

It is my belief that this game is under rated! A lot of folks I talk to say the game is random, but I completely disagree. This is a strategical game with abstract elements similar to playing chess. Granted the more players you have, the less control you have over the final outcome when the monster moves. That is precisely why you should attempt to think ahead and prepare for the worst case scenario (or best depending on your perspective). The advanced rules/tiles add a great twist...but I prefer not to use the teleporters!!This is a fun game that both adults and kids can enjoy....also very good for nongamers

I think this one has the potential to be a lot of fun but I haven't had the chance to bring it out too often. My gaming group isn't big on these sorts of games.

*Update* (From a 7 to a 6.5) Played a few more times with the group and everyone does seem to enjoy it but not enough to request it. It's fun with a large group to watch in terror as the monster changes direction towards your lone man in the corner. Even with all the players it's very much a beer and pretzels game.

I like this game! I like the theme! 
There is a problem if you play it with newbies (or young gamers) that, since the game is essentially about planning your moves and foreseeing your opponents moves, someone moving their pieces almost at random will turn the game into chaos. Also, although I have not had the problem yet, there may be some players who will suffer from analysis paralysis.

Basically a neat themed race game with a cool monster mechanic where it is uncertain where and how far he will move and whether he will kill or only move.  

Very light so it plays like a filler but it is longer than a filler should be. There is some thinking as a subtle move could thwart some opponents and catch them off guard making a fun little screwage factor. I see someone suggesting a timer to force you to play even faster and I can see why that might be even more fun.

This was a lot of fun the first few times I played it but I quickly got very bored with the game. While not very strategic the decisions can be tough.

Overall, it feels too long for what it is and the downtime can be terrible.

This is a fun racing game with a twist.  The monster can eat your players, either sending them back to start or removing them entirely.  There is a pretty big screwage factor, leading to some interesting play.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (January 2011)

Good game, just not one I would like to play every time. The game has a low luck level, mostly in the setup and the way the monster move, but you know where you and your opponents can move so the game is more meaty that I initially though. However the game is still light enough to play with a wide kind of audience, plus the rules are very easy to teach.

The game must be played fairly quickly, if not it becomes very boring. The components are very good and I love the theme (and the blood pools :devil:).

FF can be great fun with the right game group, it has a lot of “take that” moments in it.

I will play it FF again in the future and I’m considering buying it. Perhaps my favorite Friedemann Friese game.

RATING: 9
We've had a few games now, 2P, 3P, 5P. Five seems more chaotic than we like while still having the players want to ponder. I suspect it'd be great with six or seven and/or five played by quick instinct.Four "modes" to play seem to significantly change game feel: Quick instincts vs ponder, and silence vs table talk.We're going to get a lot of use out of this one.I didn't pick up that you have to peel and stick 50 stickers to assemble all the player pieces. A chore, but a once off.We also tried playing with a 15 second timer, which meant we messed up acounting which pieces had moved a couple of times but overall probably improves the fun factor.To dial up the difficulty just a little, give the monster  n movement, eg  1 or  3 or so.

Well, this started as a 7.5 because I'd only played it as a 2 player game, and moved to a 9 now that I've played it with 3, 4, and 5.  I think the sweet spot is 4.   I've had a lot of fun with this game because of its theme, because all the games have been sorta close, and I think it is FUN to have to not get eaten.  I have had some people bog things down a bit on their turn, so I'm contemplating getting a timer for it to speed things along.

Update, this is a solid 9 as I've played it more, even non-gamers seem to like it, which is good.

Cute, looked fun, but didn't have enough to it to interest me or the 8 yo child I played with. Hide behind monster, hide behind stone, sacrifice people to lure monster.

28.10.2009: Takes a while to get how the monster moves, but then the fun starts when you try to lure it towards the other players while moving your pieces to good positions.

RATING: 5
The absolute best part of this game is the phenomenal kitschy art on the box and game pieces, as well as the mix-and-match monster assembly. After that, it's generally downhill if you decide to play the game. Not that the game is terrible. With the right audience, I'm sure this could be a hoot. The board is a giant grid onto which is placed a few features that hinder or help sight lines and movement. Players control 3 or 4 pawns (two-sided disks) with the objective of getting from one corner of the board to the other without the monster catching you. After you move a pawn you flip it and each side has different movement values (1-6, 2-5, 3-4, 4-3). When everyone has moved and flipped you draw a tile to see how the monster moves. The monster goes straight, looking left and right. If it sees a pawn, it goes after it up to its max movement. If it passes another pawn that is closer, it will go for that one. In this way, players try to get safely across the board while setting other players up to get their pieces eliminated. 

It's essentially a kid's game, even if the game play is a bit mean for that crowd. With more players the game would be chaotic and with less players it is a bit more strategic but less exciting. I don't think the strategy is very interesting in this one, so I say load up the table and bring on the chaos!

A game of trying-not-to-get-eaten-by-a-monster. The monster moves in a pre-defined way, so you have to strategize how best to hide your guys, OR, as I like to do, use your guys to distract the monster and hope that he gets distracted by someone closer before he gets to you. It was quite fun and there was more strategy than I thought there would be.

I expected a gameplay in between Roborally and Ricochet Robots. Something with more brains or atmosphere. The actual gameplay was a bit disappointing at first. But it gets better once you discover the possibilities for mean moves which are mostly limited to the last token and recognize that the first moves matter as well as you have to avoid potentially critical positions. The 8/10 rating is only for 3-4 players. With more players there's not much use playing it as it gets very random but players still will think long without much purpose.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There just isn't enough interaction in the game to matter. The person who goes first has a hideous advantage. That person has won in both the games I've played. 

If you accept that you aren't playing to win but for those amazing moments when you orchestrate a monster eating another player's piece, the game can be really fun. It's kinda like someone took the Vincent Price Scooby Doo shows and made it so the monster is real. And eats you.

RATING: 7
A decent enough game with a tounge in cheek theme. A corny looking monster out to eat some very suspecting game players. A bit of strategy involved trying to keep one step ahead of the monster and also out think your opponents. Also any game where there is no dice and hense, no luck is always worth a try. You can't blame anyone but yourself and Furunkulus.

Not as fun as I had hoped, though I was tired when playing it.  I can't seem to see how the monster is going to move.  I can see how downtime and mini/maxing can really suck the fun out of the game.  I'd like to play again to see if I enjoy it any more.

Fairly light run-from-monster game. Might suffer from a bit of AP as players try to calculate where the monster will run to, but the game is quick enough that it doesn't matter. There is also a nice bit of screwage since you can set other players up to be eaten.

Good filler with nice monster bits to build your own monster.

There's something that feels cartoonishly classic about Fearsome Floors, like it might have been one of the better mass market board games from the 80's.  That 50's horror veneer and those cliche' characters of the era, along with monster-building, being chased, and setting your friends up for an attack, all just feels more fun than you think it should.  There are some fun tactics here in how you choose to move your characters and how the monster walks around the dungeon (especially in anticipating where the monster will walk through a wall to end up).  Seems like the perfect game to play along with other similarly themed games on Halloween night with "Monster Mash" blaring in the background.

Played once, and wanted to play a bit more. I liked the way you put yourself in position to attract the monster...and guide it to the other players.After getting it, I tried the game with 3 players, and something just doesn't seem to work right. I think we made a rules mistake -- moving the monster after each player's movement, which meant the monster ate up just about every player token on the board each game. But it we play that the monster moves only after all of the players have gone, it seems like escape woube be too easy. I suspect this game cries out for a rules variant.

The mechanic is genius.  There is strategy to make sure the monster won't go after you and yet a total newbie to boardgame will love the game too. Just the right balance btw luck(you never really know how far the monster will walk) and strategy.  This game was a total "coup de coeur" for me and I hunted down a copy the next day.  Also a very good gateway game.

It would be better if everyone plays it quickly, which also fits to the assumed setting. You don't have enough time to think deeply if a monster is chasing after you! The game gets bogged down if one tries to predict the monster's possible movements in great detail.

RATING: 9
Simple fun. This is an 'easy to learn and a lifetime to master' game. I can't say anything negative about it. This has become my 'desert island' game. It forces you to think, but not too much, and without losing the surprise of random happenings. GENIUS!

Juego que merece la pena tenerse en una ludoteca, pueden jugar hasta 7 personas con lo poco habitual que es eso en los juegos de mesa. Dinámica simple y muy divertida. Se pueden dar casos realmente divertidos cuando en el último movimiento de un jugador hace cambiar todos los planes previstos por los demás jugadores. Se puede quemar rápido por la simpleza que tiene, por lo que es mejor sacarlo de vez en cuando.

A wonderfully, quirkly little game with some very interesting tactical maneuvering. Unfortunately, the price tag is scarier than the monster.

RATING: 5
This is another light game mostly played for its theme.  There are definitely important tactical decisions, but most of the control lies with the last player (at least when he's playing well).  The special tiles can spice up the game if it gets stale, but perhaps only by adding more complexity and/or chaos.

Light and fun game with unique game mechanic. Finstere Flure is a game that you should not take too seriously or otherwise you will miss all the fun. Hmm... how should I move my pieces so I could get the monster in the middle of the my opponent pieces... Clever game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players must maneuver their disks through the dungeon trying to maniuplate the movement of a monster who is always after fresh prey. Players can try and lead the monster to opponents pieces, but may find themselves eaten instead! Pieces might slide along blood slicks, or be crushed between a boulder and a wall. You can even try to get the monster to teleport to another part of the board, where he will fall upon his next victim!

I have this game because it supports  a large number of players (up to 7).  This game is very fun if played the right way which involves using TWO monsters and players not really being too analytical about their best move to escape alive.  My main issue with this game is that if someone takes time to think about their best move, it gets boring very quickly.

A great surprise. This entered my wishlist because my wife loved the theme by that time - she was actually into zombies but none of the zombie games seems to be really interesting for our tastes. This one, although not really a "zombie" game, is just great. Looks silly at first, but turns out to be a great tactical game. Unless of course when played with too many players (up to seven are possible!), in which case it can be a bit too chaotic (but I would rather play 7-player Fearsome Floors than most party games on the market).

Fun and quirky, but it seems like the key to it is learning how to "lead" the monster to other players, which can lead to some serious downtime. Some folks I've played with have trouble understanding how the monster moves, and so they got frustrated pretty easily. It's not one I feel I need to own, but I don't mind playing it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another fun Friedemann Friese. It's probably too chaotic for serious play but the monster roaming around and stomping players will never fail to amuse. The best moments come from luring the monster into line of sight of other, closer players. Finstere Flure is a solid party game with elegant movement mechanics.

Enjoyable. The only variable is how far the monster will go on any turn; and that's about the right amount of randomness for me. If you can strategize to avoid him, regardless (tough to do), you'll be successful. But, since the moves are not simultaneous, even the best plans can be easily thwarted (maybe that should be a variant -- simultaneous, ordered movement)...

The fact that this game is subject to analysis-paralysis is a compliment for this comic, horror-themed game.

RATING: 5
Flawed, frustrating, five out of ten (Based on 3 plays two with 4 players and 1 with six).

Sorry for being flippant - I must admit I am a gamer with little brain and there is strategy to this game (there must be as some opponents procrastinate over every move) but it is not one that matches the little intelligence I have.  At a base level get behind the monster, hide or run just doesnt appeal.  I was hoping for so much more with the B-movie artwork, the reputation of the designer and the fun theme.  I would rather have my limbs ripped off, as the monster was when we finally put this game away, than play this game with the basic setup again.

I want more carnage and with one monster it was just a slow procession through a dungeon with some nice architecture and some interesting red stuff on the floor.  Can't be blood as no-one gets killed, maybe its jam.

As a fast-paced, chaotic race game, Fearsome Floors is brilliant fun. The problem is, it can also be played as a brain-burner, which is considerably less fun. AP prone players will be tempted to work out the optimal move, but often, a single careless move by a less-thinky player can ruin any plans, and all that over-thinking will be for nought. My advice is that if playing with anyone who wants to think too much, introduce a 30 second turn rule.

Es un juego sencillo ideal para adultos y chicos de 9 anos en adelante. Rápido de preparar. Con una duración por juego de 40 minutos. El adjetivo es conseguir salir con sus 4 o 3 piezas del laberinto habitado por Frankestein, primero que el resto de jugadores. Es una carrera contra los demás jugadores quienes a su vez buscaran distraer la atención del monstruo de sus piezas y pasar desapercibidos.

Fast and light.  It can be a little bit of a brain burner if you let it, though.  You have to be very careful about where the monster will go.  My group has a lot of table talk, and at least twice per game someone has made a comment that indicated that they didn't see how the monster would move from the given position.  Can be a little tricky.

7 players isn't very interesting.

My raiting is droping as I play this more.  Maybe it is my group, maybe it is the game, but this game seems to really suffer from a run away leader problem.  There just seems to be no way to stop them after a certain point.  The last few times we have stoped playing at the begining of the last turn since we can already see the results there is no need playing it.

We've had great fun with this one. Takes a bit to wrap around the strategy involved with the movemnent of the monster.. or his 'programming' as it were.

Chaos with 7.  Fun chaos.

I read about Analysis Paralysis being a problem in this game but we luckily enjoyed our 7 players game a lot.  It's a nice evening closure game as it's not too long and it's light enough.

Thumbs up to Friedman Friese for the terrific Frankenstein automatic movement.  Truly genious.

RATING: 6
Fine competitive puzzle, didn't work that well for us. It has everything to be fun, the possibilities are great to make tricky moves or small sacrifices in exchanges for big moves, or to just plainly screwing with everyone, but somehow those possibilities present themselves so rarely, that it loses a lot of tension. Probably we are just lame at this, or three players are not enough, but it has much less take that moments, than expected.

Finstere Flure 
New in collection sept 07.

Bizarre race game. Simple rules but loads of fun to play. Usually lots of fun. Good stuff!

NL: Probeer als eerste 3 van je poppetjes langs het hongerige lopende monster naar de uitgang te krijgen. 

Hilarisch door beglijdbare bloedplassen, wegduwbare rotsblokken waar je achter kunt schuilen en een ontzettend dom monster dat altijd naar het dichtsbijzijnde hapje (jouw poppetjes) loopt. Het monster kan door muren lopen, jij niet.

RATING: 5
This game can be good with lots of players (6 or 7) and lots of obstacles, BUT it's important that players are encouraged to move quickly or else the game can drag; a 1 minute timer may help to speed up the game. The only other problem is that the game can end suddenly. It's best not to take the game too seriously.

Typical analysis paralysis game -- there is abolutely no randomness, meaning that with enough time, everything can be figured out. With the wrong group, the game can really, really, really drag. With the right group, this can be fun, but then you don't really have much control over what happens.

RATING: 8
Nice blend of silliness and depth. I tend to enjoy puzzle games, (this, [gameid=24417], [gameid=528]) especially two-player. Certainly has the potential to get nasty (in a good way) with more familiarity - especially in the two-player game, which naturally bears some resemblance to Yinsh. But you can play with up to seven!

The "advanced" rules, with the teleporters and the turny things -- and, if you're playing on yucata, random setup -- really add a lot. At least for online play, the tradeoff of a little more downtime for an additional puzzley dimension is a win, and keeps my rating high.

Fearsome Floors is a simple game where players control characters in a dungeon trying to escape. However, to hinder their advances, a monster lurkes in the halls. Players try to maneuver their pieces to the exit on the other side of the board and avoiding the monster and various obstacles.

A simple game, Fearsome Floors is a simple and easy to explain to new players. It has a campy sort of feel to it, which adds to its charm. What makes this game fun is the fact that players can try to lure and maneuver the monster into eating other players. Of course, there's a risk involved as the best laid plans sometimes backfires. Another bonus is that it supports 7 players. There are no deep strategies or serious book keeping involved in this game nor is it prone to "analysis paralysis."

If you do decide to give Fearsome Floors a try, we've found in our gaming that playing with 2 monsters makes the game even more fun! It seems easy enough to avoid one monster, but having 2 makes the game more frantic and exciting.

RATING: 7.5
Awesome little game. Can't get my head wrapped around it, though. Somehow you must be able to figure it out and know what's going to happen (approximately). Takes a lot of planning, but aarrgh, who cares, let's just go. Darn, that monster is heading straight for me! AAAAARRGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Charming theme...each player controls a number of character discs trapped in a dungeon with a monster in hot pursuit.  The first player to get all but one of their players out of the dungeon wins.

Although this is an easy game to learn, I would suggest that this game plays the best when everyone involved is familiar with the movement mechanics.  The result being a much more lively game with more monster confrontation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Nice 2-player game with room for screwage and clever play. There is randomness in that you don't know how far the monster will move on any given turn, so the game is about risk assessment. 

Fearsome Floors was my 3000th play logged on BGG.

Played some things wrong in our first game: The monster is supposed to reenter on the corresponding letter on the opposite wall; It sounds like you have use of all 4 characters on the second turn (though that would make 2 on the colored side and 2 on the black side which is confusing).

The 7-player game is a little too crowded and chaotic. 5 players felt like a nice balance. 4 might be perfect.

Fun, family-friendly Scooby-Doo type game in which you try to lead your characters across the floor of a monster roaming around.  Everytime the monster sees a character, it will move toward it.  This makes it so you can lure the monster to get other players.

Loved this game despite doing really badly.  Production design is great and the gameplay is really fun, especially as all 6 players were scrabbling for safety any which way after some people purposefully screwed things up by sacrificing themselves!

I would recommend this to anyone.  We played the basic game but the alternative has further rules for the way pillars affect the monster's movement around the board.

Cool.  So cool, in fact, that I bought the game.  Looks like it is getting an english reprint in March 2008.  I couldn't wait so bought a German copy from the French website, Ludibay.com.

Fearsome floors is a fun game with a great monster theme.  Each player moves around their players trying to dodge the monster which moves by a unique mechanic that draws him to the nearest player.  The trick is hide where the monster can't see you, and draw the monster into your opponents.

This game plays 6 fairly well.  I don't like the fact that you know who the winner is before the games ends, so there's little point in playing the final round.

This game looks great.

This is one very fun game.  It has some tactics, but just sneaking through the maze, trying to either stay ahead of the monster, or lure it towards other players is amazing fun!

Inside the dungeon lives a hungry monster that moves by predetermined rules. Inside the dungeons are you and your fellow players, each controlling three player tokens (with 7 players). First player to get two tokens out of the dungeon wins. Now, I played this once with 7 players, and we knew it was quite random, but it was kind of fun and innovative. I think it is neat with the theme of a monster running amok and everyone is trying to get away. Don't try and play this game for strategic value, just enjoy the experience.

This game looks and sounds like something I'd hate, but it's pretty bearable.  I went into it, with the advanced rules, knowing nothing about it;  if it had been introduced as "similar to RoboRally" (a comment you'll almost certainly hear from people who have played that abomination), I would've run away screaming.  It's still the sort of game at which I'll probably never be much good, though.

Takes too long for what it is. I think the design is very original - but I dislike the luck of the draw in the monster movement cards. Also, it's just..so boring.

If this was compressed into a quick, fun, filler, I would love it - but it just takes too long for the enjoyment level.

I've happened upon a group that enjoys this game immensely.  When played with speed and a relishing of the vicious tone the game pays off in a bloody blitz chaos puzzle.  When played in a cold calculating fashion someone should find a timer because the game is about to die.

Fearsome Floors might be the purest game of the Grid Movement mechanic as there is literally nothing else you do.

The FF's depth revolves around positioning your characters so that the monster will pursue other players' rather than yours, which is no easy task. FF's charm comes from its campy horror theme, its simplistic play and short game length, while its longevity comes from the variety of scenarios to try.

FF is essentially Monster Keep-away.

RATING: 5
Quick game where you need to get your pieces out of the mansion before the monster eats them.  Pretty funny mechanics with how you move the monster.  Very easy to learn and a quick play.  A bit repetitive, but it is quick enough and fun to watch friends get eaten by the monster.  The monster also has different parts and is customizable!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great that it can play so many, and there's an interesting RoboRally element to it in figuring out how a thing will move based upon a set of rules. The theme's a fun one, and the game will appeal to those who enjoy puzzles. There's also an interesting arc in that as the game progresses, some players will have fewer pieces due to their characters having been eaten or having escaped, and therefore have less control over their fate. Ultimately, however, it's too easy for the game to come down to a kingmaker situation.

RATING: 7
Funny and chaotic game of trying to escape a dungeon without being eaten by a monster. It's got a little Galaxy Trucker-like schadenfreude and it's amusing trying to get other people to be eaten.

My one play was slightly spoiled by one player analysing exactly where the monster would go on every player's turn, out loud. I don't know why he would do this since he was only helping others.

A fun, light game. But a good logical game where you need to try to position yourself safely. A fun, fast, light strategy game. Played quickly, this game can be a good deal of fun.

It is a nice and fun light game to play from time to time. It is much better with the expert rules!

It is very good game that works even in a big (6-7) group IF people are playing fast enough. It really starts to be boring if players think too much. Theme is wonderful! You really anticipate to see monsters movement phase.

Friedemann Friese's hilarious monster madness. As can be expected from 2F Spiele, the artwork is once again excellent.

Fun filler for large numbers of players. It might be a good idea to use two monsters when playing with five or more, since this literally eliminates runaway leaders.

RATING: 9
Finstere Flure's idea is absolutely hilarious - each player leads a gang of baddies across the board (hiding behind pillars, sliding on blood pools and so on) while avoiding a thick but huge and blood-thirsty monster that moves in the direction of the closest player (ahead of him or sideways).

Of course the predictably wild play gets more and more chaotic (or exciting, depending on your point of view) with more players, but the game for two is already exhilarating - with hardly any luck (just how far the monster walks each time) there's loads of tactics involving moving the pawns alone or in groups, pushing the obstacles on the board, luring the monster into the direction where the opponent has their pawns...

...to put it short, Fearsome Floors is both a gentle brain workout and a nasty guffaw-fest. One of the most original and filling party games available, only slightly less potent with five or more players (meaner feel but less influence of single players on the outcome of the game).

RATING: 6.5
Simpaticissimo family game dove non manca un po' di strategica necessaria per poter primeggiare. Il grande successo del gioco però è legato alla simpatica ambientazione e l'immedesimazione con i propri personaggi che dovranno fuggire dall'abominevole mostro Furunkulus.
Materiali essenziali ma all'altezza, grafica simpatica, regolamento immediato.

FF is a fairly simple, abstract game, in which players try to get their pawns from one corner to the opposite corner of a board that is laid out in a simple grid. A monster moves according to a simple algorithm, eating player pawns as it encounters them. British-bulldog-the-boardgame.

The theme is pretty thin, but entirely appropriate. There is some fun siccing the monster on other players (would appeal to teenagers) but overall it's not one for me.

Just got this one.  I like the analogy to Robo Rally.  Its a similar concept.  My first game 2 of us managed to get only 1 person out alive.  This definitely falls into the category of games you have to think about your movement but don't put too much stock in b/c other player movements can mess up even the greatest plan (ala Robo Rally or even Puerto Rico).

----------
First play of this game dragged on (as warned by the Dice Tower), so I play this game with a 60-second timer for the first phase (where players respawn), and a 30-second timer for the second phase.

The end result is that the game feels as dangerous and panicky as it should. You're being chased by a monster, after all.

A fantastic Halloween game. You might not think so at first, but the monster is very difficult to outmeneuver. You will most likely die. This is a very strategic game if you intend on winning! But if you just want to give it a go and see if luck is with you, you might escape with your life...but most likely not!

RATING: 5
I think the game-play itself is just ordinary, especially if people over-think their turns, but watching the monster wander-and-whack makes it fun for the occasional outing. A 5 second time limit should induce the right sense of race fun that the game is surely designed for, and will outweigh the problem that all but the last few plays in each turn are made with no knowledge of where the monster will be going. If we play with 4 or less, then we can spend more time playing it tactically, creeping about the dungeon. It's quite a flexible game in that respect. But too many times it gets bogged down in over analytics which is antithetical to the theme of the game and not seemingly in the right spirit. As such, this game fails me more often than it succeeds, even with the kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light game that is playable for younger kids 8+.  You could go even younger then that (all kids really need to be able to do is count to play), but they will not hide or mess with the monster as well as adults.

A nice light game.  Can play 7 which is nice, but a bit more random (as most games are when you get above 5).

Backgammon on steroids. More fun than RoboRally. Neat design. A thematic abstract chaotic race of getting most of your people out of a dungeon, while dodging an AI monster. Games can play quick when everyone knows the rules. The advanced rules make every board setup different. 2 player is fine, but the game is better with more.

I think of Fearsome Floors as a family game. Gamers will say this is too long for what it is, but it's still faster than RoboRally. This satisfies my itch to play RoboRally somehow.

Family Game-ish. Beer-N-Pretzels Game.

I wish the blood slick rules were more explained in the rulebook for more scenarios. The examples led me to believe that the blood slick mechanism for movement was different for the characters than for the monster. The BGG forums helped me understand better.

I love this game. Have had it for about 10 years now and I can't ever turn it down. One of the best games in my collection and now in my personal Top 10. Outstanding design that has players engage and scratch their heads. Monster movement is genius (and simple) and I love how the pieces scatter about the board trying to find hiding just to get caught by Furunkulus thanks to a sneaky and well placed opponent piece. Absolutely brilliant game.

Feel like the game is sweeter with more players (even tho 4 provides the 2nd most counters) as the chaos factor increases, also may benefit from a short timer just to keep things rolling along and more prone to mistakes.
Simple to play and even if you're eliminated most people don't mind as it's fun

8/5/10 Considering taking one move card out to make the fatal round come quicker. Also too many people are getting in range of the exit in the first round so I guess we should play more against each other

Quando si tratta di fare giochi semplici e divertenti, Friese non lo batte nessuno. In altre mani, Finstere Flure poteva essere un giocone dell'oca e niente più. L'uomo dai capelli verdi si è inventato una meccanica diabolica (turno con "passo" breve seguito dal turno con "passo" lungo, il mostro che si muove in maniera algoritmica, l'assenza di dadi). E poi è breve e può fare da "preliminare" a giochi più corposi. Giocato con i giusti amici l'esperienza di gioco diventa indimenticabile.

A race to exit Mumm-ra's cave, before he eats you! At the same time, you're trying to mess up with other players so that Mumm-ra will eat them and thus further delay them. A nice "algorithmic" game, as you're trying to manipulate Mumm-ra's movement to your favor, while other are also doing the same. Nice, light game, I enjoy it!

This game is pretty much what I thought it was going to be: a fun race of maneouvering to avoid the monster, and perhaps even luring him to eat an opponent.

I played it 3 times,only 2 players.
I thought the game was very fun,easy to learn and played in a nice time amount. We played 2 times basic game and then the advanced game. I say the advanced game was much more fun,and more strategy involved and not much more to learn,I say just go to the advanced game and dont look back. All and all the game played well,and was very close in the end and the monster was always pretty close "except the 1 game in the 2nd half,there was no threat of the monster,I guess it just will work out like that from time to time"
I like the game and recommend it,I wouldn't say this is a main game,I guess people call them filers. It would be a good game to start the night off,or one of those quick one more games of the night as it only takes about a half hour. Another game that im glad is in my collection.

First run through the dungeon with 7 players(21 characters)which, despite enforced timed turns, isn't an ideal number. The right minded crowd makes it fun, with the blood sliding, character jostling and the "attitude" of the monster and its wraparound reappearance instilling some humour. Because of the strong puzzle element, some players may well be attracted in solving rather than playing quickly. Puzzle games such as Richochet Robot aren't my kind of thing, but I admire the production values and innovations gone into this independent effort.

RATING: 5
This is a peculiar game. On the one hand it seems that you may be able to advance your cause by some complex, allbeit straight forward, tactical planning.  On the other hand, most of your planning could be rendered meaningless due to one of the numerous intervening moves taked by the opponents, not necessarily intending to harm you.

This game immediately reminded me of RoboRally. You might be able to make some great plans, but usually you can't count of them to play out as expected.

So, the game falls into a light, not-to-be-taken-seriously category. The problem is, for this category of games FF is too long, has too much down time, and is boring. Perhaps it's ok to play a couple of times a year with a group that enjoyes the game.

There are a bunch of brilliant ideas into this light game (like for instance the blood pools to slide).
The theme and the components are fantastic (though I seem to be the only one around who doesn't like building the monster everytime)
The movement rules are so smart, both the characters' moves, at a different pace each turn, and the random monster moves.
I can't understand how come it ranks below the top 400 here in BGG. It is so much fun.

Have played this game about four times with 3, 4, and 5 people.  We are still playing on the easier setups and can find some issues with sprinters getting through the game quickly, but how can you fault a game that runs like an episode of Scooby Doo?  Very well thought out and a great source of lunchtime gaming fun.

This game has coolness written all over it-from the freaked-out looks on the players peoples to the "build-it-yourself" Monster.  This game has a lot of the qualities I admire in a game: great theme, simple yet elegant rules, easy to teach, and relatively short (all of which means this game is appealing to non-gamers in my family, and thus, I can actually get someone to play).  It is definitely more fun with all the extra do-dads (teleporters and the like); indeed, I once tried to manipulate the monster's movement to get someone else, but because I miscalculated the role of a teleporter, the darn thing ate ME!  My only complaints are 1)I wish it came with 7 teams of 4 characters (instead of 4 of 4, and 3 of 3), so that even in a 3 player game you can choose a complete team of your choice (like the fans...), and 2) the fact that the "extra" stickers didn't come with wooden tokens to place them on...I had to make my own tokens!

Great little chase game where anything can happen and often does. Slow plodding monster...think again! He moves fast and is very hungry! Played a six player game and it was insane! Ended quickly though... as you can, if you are lucky, hide in the crowd when Furunkulus comes a-feeding!

RATING: 7
Great artwork and theme. In my first game a few players over-analysed, and I started reading the rules to Mystery of the Abbey half way through and it didn't seem too detrimental. Every player needs to be a chess champion OR raging drunk (don't combine the two) for it to work. 

UPDATE: Wow! A 10-second move rule was introducted and my rating has jumped from a 5 to 8. Love it! You don't need to over-anaylse this game. With a group of fast-players this is good, good fun. Just pick your playing group carefully.

What a great game...  it's hilarious to see all the players scramble out of the way of the monster!  The advanced rules add some crazy twists that make determining the moves of the monster a challenge to say the least!  So far I've played with 4 players tops and the system handled it well...  it'll be neat to see what happens when 7 are on board.

EDIT: nice and light... however it suffers from analysis paralysis quite a bit.  Dropped to 6 because of this.

Ha ha ha ha ha!  The chaos!  I am so bad at planning my moves and I am easily fooled.  Luckily, that just makes Fearsome Floors more fun.  It's more tactical with two players, but more random and fun with more players.  My rating is lower than it could be because other than the fun, I don't really think there is much to the game.  But there is a lot of fun!

Let's first consider that I enjoy "non-motorsports" racing games, rating highly the likes of RoboRally, Um Reifenbreite and even Hare & Tortoise (the original German edition). I also like silly backstabbing games. I'd be naturally inclined to enjoy Fearsome Floors, but I didn't find this game engaging at all on my first play -- must give it a second chance. Maybe it's the mechanic, maybe the paper-thin theme... I still don't know.

Light, fun enjoyable game. Great components, and fun to look at! However, I learned from my first time playing it, that this game can suffer from analysis-paralysis if you allow it. Make everyone take their turn within 15 seconds and WITHOUT discussion. Not all of your moves will be perfect, but you're SUPPOSED to be running and sliding through these halls,  terrified, frantic, on the verge of lunacy, and making (Curly Howard) Whoop Whoop Whoop noises!

I really really wanted to like this game but in the end it's a party game (what I was going in for) that is no fun to play. Much of the game is essentially characters piling up in the bottom right corner of the map with a couple of tokens escaping from the chaos. Like I say, 'light' games are OK with me, but they have to not be a bore to get through, that is the very minimum I ask from them...

Being a fan of the old EC Comics, I couldn't pass this game up.  The theme works very well for this game and adds to the fun of a nice late-night closer game.  Have played with 4 and with 7 and the games works equally well with both.  Game atmosphere enhanced if players engage in table talk not quiet analysis, but game can drag (especially with more players) if the theme of "quick escape" is forgotten and people want to analyze every possible move.

It´s very good board game. And very interesting because if you play it with just two players, it´s very a tactical game (in this case, we play with two monsters instead of one). However, the more people (four players I´d say it's the ideal...) the more chaos, and the more fun, and it´s a kind of party game. I love its artwork, and its fresh sense of humor (Friese´s style of games!).

Alright, running for your life from a horrible monster has got to be one of the coolest themes a game can have. The monster "algorithm" to decide how the monster moves is good, and the rulebook actually is very well written for a game with so many little special cases. As a strategy game, this game is totally lacking and really fits more in the random fun category.

They said it resembles the flying chess, but I don't see many similarities. Each player controls a team of four, trying to escape from the freak. Since the frightening freak walks faster than the wind (a speedy zombie, good), the only hope of your escaping lies in hiding behind obsticles. To attract the attention of the freak is also a solid strategy. It's a good family game anyway.

I wanted to play this because it was Halloween, and it ended up being rather fun. I think this was due to the fact that I was playing entirely with people I like and who don't overthink their moves. I would NEVER play this with AP-prone people. If it's played for laughs and fun, I'll play. 

It's a brain-burner wrapped in a schlock horror theme. I liked the graphics, mechanisms, and theme.

Almost everyone I've introduced FF to has loved it.  It's gotten a lot of play (so I've definitely gotten my money's worth with it, which I can't say about every game I've purchased), and the theme and components are great. The game definitely gets more chaotic with more people, but that makes it more fun.

A chaotic race game for a lot of players. Takes about 30 minutes to play, and it's funny. It can have a "take that" feel with some mean gamers, but its over quick enough that it's OK.  The first time I played this I played it right before a game of Power Grid - it was very interesting to see two very different designs from the same designer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Players get a group of tokens with different move values on each side. After each move, the tokens flip. The game takes play on a grid filled with obstacles and a monster that moves according a static rules (basically it chases the nearest player token it can "see"). The game plays and feels like a programming experiment. The tokens are nicely themed (they're people stuck in this haunted watchamcallit), but really they don't feel like people because of the strict movement rules that makes them "bounce" around the board like projectiles. Still, it's an interesting mathematical exercise, so I give the game a provision rating of 7.5.

Plot how to escape the dungeon while your companions get munched. The game mechanism is very interesting, but the few games I have played have tended towards having 1 or 2 early leaders who are usually unstoppable. Don't play with 6 or 7 players.

RATING: 7.5
Sure this game has something of a goofy theme, but it is a lot of fun.  While I really like it, we tend to only play it once a year--around Halloween.  (I know, big surprise that.)  While the object of the game is to get out of the dungeon, I find much more pleasure in trying to get the monster to eat your competitors.  If people aren't getting eaten, the game is not nearly as fun.  I suppose it is the relation to programmed movement that makes me want to do that.  Overall, a game I like, though it sometimes runs a little long for what it is. [11/18/2008]

RATING: 6.6
I think this is a charming race game where players try to outrun or hide from the monster, Furunculus. Although the monster's programmed movements allow for some planning (and leave big blind spots behind him), occasionally it is tough to predict where he will maraud as other players can lure him about the board.

It's a pity the majority of my friends don't share my opinion (my rating reflects this).

The chaotic nature of Fearsome Floors can be somewhat off-putting, I think.

The art is campy awesomeness - Long Live Furunculus!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Odd game using programmed mechanics for the monster. Sometimes leads you to believe you have some control then bops you on the head. Not to be taken seriously as the art may suggest. A very cool looking game and my daughter loves putting together the monster.

Fearsome floors is hilarious. This ridiculous monster, your own variable creation, trundles along in a dungeon trying to eat you. Your turn is very simple, just move your characters as many spaces as the number on their chit and hope you don't get eaten. The game shines when its time for Furunkulus to move. He can make up a lot of ground very quickly, and his silly teleporting through walls ability can be really surprising. I can see some people bogging down in analysis paralysis, but that is really contrary to the spirit of the game. One of those games where you don't mind losing.

Az első találkozásom a játékkal egy 7-es partiban sikerült. Ez alapján azt tudom mondani, hogy jó alapötletű, érdekes, tetszetős játék, de hihetetlen kaotikus, illetve nagyon szerencsefüggő. Lehet kevesebb játékosnál már kicsit kevesebb a szerencse. Partyjátéknak. családi játéknak tökéletes, igazi stratégiai játékként viszont ne tekintsen rá senki.

A gond a játékkal annyi, hogy tulajdonképpen számolható, de a számolás megöli a játékot övező partyélményt. Vagy mindenki vegye komolyan vagy senki se, nincs más lehetőség, mert akkor csökken az élvezeti faktor.

I enjoyed this one a bit.  It seemed during our game that no one could think ahead far enough to determine exactly where Frunkulus would go (actually, we re-named him 'Humpulus', but that's a different story) but through an odd twist, he ended up at the exit right about the end of the game, when all players were gathered around it, so a lot of characters died right before they finished the game due to Humpulus's insatiable hunger.

Great fun with that, "Oh crap, I didn't think of that" feeling. Definitely either play with fast players for fun or with a timer. Keep it fast! You're running from monsters! If played with slow players, this drops to a 4 since you pretty much have nothing to do if it's not your turn. EDIT: Luckily, my "non-gamer" group plays this fast and furious. We play with two monsters to up the carnage. EDIT: Now that I've played with the special tiles, I'll never go back. Great unexpected (unplanned for?) moster mayhem!

A nice light game with rules that are simple enough to draw in very casual gamers.  It's entertaining to get the monster to eat other players and there's not much downtime between turns, since all you do is move one of your pieces a set number of spaces.  It does lack the depth and interesting decisions to make it something I'd like to play all the time, but it's good to bring a large group together from time to time.

RATING: 6
Players have 2-sided tokens with numbers adding up to 7. Each round, players take turns moving one of their unmoved tokens, then flipping the token over. Can interact with board elements sort of like RoboRally. Next, Furunkulus moves: flip movement card over, which determines either # victims (1 or 2) or # spaces to move. Moves step by step straight ahead, then turns towards closest player to L/R/Front (if tied, keep going straight). Continues moving till kills specified #victims or moves specified #steps. Killed tokens returned to player till part 2 of game, when they're removed from play. Part 2 starts when penultimate monster movement token is revealed (shuffle monster movement cards). 

Advanced rules add some extras.

Light fun. Have only played a few times, but don't feel the need to own it. Seems too chaotic -- would rather play RoboRally, although this is shorter.

This game is a suprise hit whenever I take it out.

This a great game for a group of 6 or 7, and can be highly interactive with the right group!

RATING: 5
This is a very light game where players move their pieces across a room full of obstacles trying to get to the exit.  Each piece can only move a certain number of spaces and the big catch to all of that is there is a monster moving across this room as well as eating people.

There are specific rules the monster has to follow and while you don't know how many spaces the monster is going to move each turn you can use your knowledge of these rules to make sure it doesn't eat you or at least mitigate that danger to some degree.

This makes for a little bit of strategy HOWEVER turn order means so much more than strategy.  The power position in this game is going last.  No matter where you move the last person to go has a lot of control in "aiming" this monster and that makes the game a bit less strategic and a lot less fun.

It's no wonder those floors are so fearsome, what with those blood slicks and body parts that sully them!  Other than the decidedly fearsome aspect of this game, it is definitely a light and fun experience.  Best of all, it can be played with up to 7 players (how many games can claim this distinction?), although it gets quite chaotic with more players.  It's a fairly light game, although not really short enough to be considered a "filler".  The fun part is trying to work out how to draw the monster just the right way!

I like the premise behind this game, but unfortunately the game play doesn't live up to expectations.  I think part of the problem is the game gets rather repetetive quickly.  Another thing I don't like is that you know exactly where the monster is going to end up if you correctly guess which movement tile will be drawn next.  Even if you don't guess, you just assume the highest remaining tile and avoid that space.  If a little more randomness could be included in moster movement or the board somehow altered to make it more interesting, then the game would probably be better.

I tend not to like super-light games.  And I tend not to like games where I have to spend a long time waiting for other players to analyze and take their turns.

Next time I'd emphasize luring the monster toward my opponents...I think I was a little too tired to "get it" the first time.

[RGG 2004 edition] {Horror, survival, Beer&Pretzels; action-point, player elimination; optimal 6-7p} {6 basic game and additional components} FF is a hilarious game with moderate depth. It has loads of fun and player interaction. It has strong theme (people running away from Monsters in a castle). Its rules are easy to understand. I like plastic monsters, rather than paper ones.

I like to use the additional obstacles in the game, which makes the game funnier. Depending on your taste, if you like a strategic play, FF should be played with only 3 or 4 players and 1 monster. In this group, it's easier to calculate the moves and make good judgment. However, if you want loads of fun and chaotic, FF should be played with 6 or 7 players. In this group, it becomes difficult to predict the moving path of the monster and act accordingly. Nevertheless, you will have lots of fun when everyone is very excited to see how the monster moves and someone is yelling when his character is eaten by the merciless monster.

It's funny that the vendor provides bonus stickers without the discs! I don't know how to use the bonus stickers without buying additional discs. Nevertheless, these 2 bonus discs are not necessary and add nothing to the game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating has dropped after a few plays.

Much more simplistic than I was hoping for with less monster interaction than expected. Plus, for this game to be fun, it should be played quickly. Afterall, you are running for your life. But, because it's a puzzle game with perfect information, players can really overanalyze their moves. I need to find a 15 second timer.

This game is okay. Just okay. I mean, if you love chaotic games where you do not have much control, you oughta love this one. Nonetheless, it's a game with a fun theme that can be enjoyed with the right crowd. Your brain can now rest.

Very good theme but the game play is a little bit boring. I played this only with my children and they liked the "hare and hounds" feeling but they did not follow the goal of the play. It is a very good idea that you can assamble the monster by yourself.

Fiendish furunkulus fears no friends!  I recall quite enjoying this, simple, easy to teach and alot of mayhem!  I'm tossing this rating MONTHS after I played it so its not really fresh in my mind.  I recall liking alot of the elements used here but noting that it was likely better with more and more people.  Either way, it was enjoyed.

Fabulously fun game! I really like the simple rules - a truly beautiful design all round. The game works great with all number of players, though very differently. I like it best with three to five players, as then it is actualy worth thinking about strategy. With two players the game is a bit too predictable and with six or seven it just becomes pure chaos - which is great fun too! The game can suffer from analysis paralysis and it might be a good idea to introduce a turn-timer.

There's some things that can be done to stop a player in the lead, but someone can do the "I'll let Mike stop Bob on his own and just take my turn so then I can win when Mike stops Bob", but Mike doesn't so then Bob wins.

This is a game that requires players to cooperate to stop others. This is simply because one person doesn't have enough movement to lure the monster in the right direction. The person trying to win will try to prevent this if they can. It took 3 people's coordination to stop one person in our game.

The nice part is that you can play with the advances pieces, and boost the difficulty to your liking. You also have enough parts for a second and third monster. Mmm... the carnage. I can hear the bones crunching now...

I should like this one more than I do - its a light-hearted game where you race to stay out of the way of the monster. The best part of the game is plotting to get the monster into the thick of things such that he starts killing everyone. But for whatever reason, this never interests me very much. 

After a few more playings I decided that there is just something missing from this - I don't know what it is, but I just don't like this game all that much.

This is a great game as long as all of the players sort of stay "in character."  That is, they need to pretend they are being chased by a monster.  Overthinking moves can kill the fun here, but if everyone moves quickly it's a blast.

I'm not so sure about this game anymore. At first I really liked it, then I played it more and like it, not just as much as at first. Now I've rached the point where I think the game is kind of dull: it's far too easy to avoid the monster (if played with only one monster, at least) and when all the players are just concentrating on escaping the labyrinth, there's really no tension and no fun. The game should played so that each player (or at least more than just one which is usually me) tries to lure the monster towards other players instead of just running to the exit. Don't know, I think I'm going to sell this.

Although the various Fearsome Floors movement mechanisms are novel and the game has a semi-cooperative element, the gameplay remain chaotic and it is very tough to plan for and influence the outcome.  These problems worsen with more and more people.  Fearsome Floors is a charmer, but don't expect deep gameplay.

A very fun (and chaotic) escape game with some nasty competitive elements (as you lure a monster to consume one of your opponents).  Tremendously fun if it 'works', but every few games the monster is caught moving too slowly or in the wrong part of the basement, making the game less interesting (but over fast).

RATING: 6
Fun little brain burner.  I've tried it once and there were 7 players, so the grid was an enjoyably chaotic mess.  It felt a bit like being within the mass of swimmers trying to get out of the water in the movie Jaws.  I'd be curious to try this with fewer players to see what effect that would have on my available options.

A favourite in my game group, just because we get to act like idiots while playing it. We usually play with three monsters, because we enjoy a good suicide mission...
Can sometimes get a bit frustrating as one of my game group members has a tendency to get confused and just move his pieces at random, which can drastically affect who lives and who dies for no reason.

I bought this thinking it would be good for my nieces and nephews. As it turns out, it was a bit too chaotic and I didn't feel like the winning objective was very strong. Avoiding and hiding from the monster seemed to override any sort of objective for all of us. I'll probably just trade it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I thought I would really like this when I read the rules and did a solo play to try it out.  I also like that it is simple and that nobody dies in the first round so the game is very forgiving to first-timers. I like the theme.

I have tried this with four different groups and it fell flat with all of them.

Also, the rules are far more convoluted than you think. It seems to sneak up on you while you are explaining it until you find yourself in a tangle of "oh yeah, I forgot to say"'s and "let me look that up again"'s and backtracking along the same loops.

It really isn't difficult, but even after reading the rules they seem simple. But they are not that simple.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2


Overall - 1

One of my essentials.  Plays great 2-7, scales perfectly, is actually a 'scary game' in that you're always worried the monster will do something crazy and come after you.  Your carefully laid plans can quickly uncoil.

Moved into a position to make sure wife's character would be killed, friend moved into a dangerous position which actually forced monster to ignore them both and come straight after me.  Very fun game.

We've had a lot of fun as a family trying to escape the monsters in this game while slipping along pools of blood.  The theme could be off putting if it wasn't presented in a cartoony/whimsical way.

I like that this game can play up to 7 players since that makes for a fun group experience at family get togethers.  Playing with more players can be fun as it makes the monster movement a little harder to predict but more players also means more down time in between turns so sometimes it bogs down too much and people can get bored.

Overall a fun game.

The theme reminds me of scooby doo, and I don't like scooby doo.

Crazy  filler.  Run away from the monster.  How much fun is that.  Probably could get stale, or be no fun with ultra competitive or AP susceptible people(unless they are 6, then it is really funny).  Otherwise, a blast with simple rules.  Watching the monster's AI programming is fun.  Watching your opponents getting eaten is a blast.  Good light fare that runs a bit too long.

RATING: 7
I definitely enjoyed this more than Friedemann Friese's other game (i.e., Power Grid).  This is a fun, pretty abstract game, where you simply try to move 3 of your 4 units from one end of the board to the other end of the board along a grid of squares.  The main obstacle is a monster that moves each turn towards the closest units it can see and devours anyone it comes across.  Avoiding the monster involves hiding behind stones and sliding across large pools of blood to get where you need to go quicker.  It was fun the first couple times, but I'm not sure if it has much staying power.  It's also best if it's played relatively quickly without people bogging down too much in analysis since you can't predict how far the monster will move, so control is somewhat limited.  I'm tempted to pick up a copy, but will have to play a few more times to see how it holds up after a few more plays.

I break this one out every October for the family.  It's the kind of family game you woulda seen in the 50s and 60s.  It's fairly simply rule-wise and Halloweeny without being ridiculously over the top gory or creepy.  So it's great for maybe 6 years old all the way up to around 90.

Fearsome Floors is a cute game that's probably best as a light filler or a kid's game.  It might be possible to "math it out" and figure out optimal play, but I think that would suck all the joy out of the game.  There's not a ton of depth here, but it's fun for a quick filler.

Ah, such a surprise with this game! Never even heard of it before I actually played it, and it was great! Fun, strategic, engaging, fits up to 7 (though the game gets really long then, so I find best to play with 3 or 4) and plays somewhat fast.

The monster movement can be use in so many ways by the players to be safe or to make the lumbering death rage upon others. Great fun!

Really liked this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Try to get your pieces off the board before they get eaten by the monster, pushing and hiding behind stones.

This was a lot of fun, though it's quite random and chaotic (due to other players' actions). The AP risk is minimized by the monster's movement being largely unknown until it happens. What I really like about the game is the sense that you should be OK as long as you're careful and don't take risks. It isn't really true (especially when something unexpected happens and your pieces that can only move 1-2 spaces are at risk), but it's maddening to think that the dumb monster AI can beat you.

Not fiddly, not a lot of rules. Could use more games like this.

Cosmetically hilarious, this game is very suitable for a quick intermezzo during a social evening with friends. The rules are easy to explain, and there is very little downtime during play. Consequently, I have played this game many times with gamers and non-gamers alike, and still have to meet the person twho dislikes it. It plays like an action-packed multiplayer computergame with lots of opportunity to screw other players with a little teamwork. Discussions among players should therefore definitely be allowed for some interesting moves :-). Added bonus: The rules are so easy to explain, that I can even play this game with my 7-year old son, who loves the idea of a creepy monster chasing kids around a dungeon.

Played a couple of 2-player games thus far and this game definitely plays better with more. I was quite surprised as to how fast the monster is capable of moving. However, we played this game without too much analyzing. Fun when this game is fast and furious. With a timer, this game should be quite brutal and unforgiving and most likely, fits the theme as well. Probably a game that I will play when asked but won't ask for it that often.

I played this at Maryland Game Days.  I can see where people could really take their time to predict the monster movement, and I could see where that could make the game pretty rough.

That might be a problem while playing for real with our normal group, but the theme and the originality meant that it was going to be an eventual purchase.

This game must be played quickly because Analysis Paralysis (AP) will kill the fun of it. I've seen it happen. The success of the game truly relies on the group. I've only played it with the basic game setup so far.

Probably the best racing game I've ever played. Very fun. (I usually don't like raceing games so a 7 is good for me). Bogs down with more than 5 players.

I like games that encourage direct player interaction, and I like maze/race games.  Why, then, does this game just annoy me?  It gets points for having such awesome artwork (I love the throwback to EC Comics), but in the end, I need a good game to hide beneath that veneer.  Fearsome Floors ain't it.

I am going to keep playing this game until it becomes fun! There is way too much downtime and not enough monster mayhem.  I would like to try this one with a timer and the warp spots, but I have a hard time getting it to the table.

Update:  Played this again with six players and had more fun than in the past.  Things still seemed to drag a bit, and I can definitely see that the sweet spot for this one would be with a few fewer players.  I think five would be optimal since everyone has one fewer piece than if playing with 1-4 players and there would still be enough pieces on the board to cause some havoc with the monster.

RATING: 8
Fantastically fun! I've always wanted to like games like RoboRally and (to a lessor extent) Dungeon Lords because I like the idea of programmed actions, but in practice I tend to find it frustrating because a single mistake gets multiplied out several times and can put you at a huge disadvantage. FF has the same tension of not knowing exactly what's going to happen, but you have enough information to assess the risk, and mistakes only hit you once (albeit in a big way). Add to that a quick playing time, fun theme (though maybe a little dark for young children) and 7 player support and this is a game I heartily recommend.

Nice game for at least 3 players. Flipping the tokens over after movement seems to get forgotten a bit, but after a while we all remembered.

RATING: 5
I'm somewhat ambivalent about this game. I suppose it makes for a decent "large group" game, but I honestly think I'd rather play Codenames, or For Sale, or Liar's Dice, etc.  On the plus side, children really seem to enjoy this game.  Gave this one away.

Enjoyed the game.  It is light, but not overly.  It's one of those games that kids will love, and the parents will tolerate, 'cuz there are some pretty good decisions...some down time if people aren't paying attention, but that's even at most a minute or two (becomes alot with 6 players).  I will play again, and will probably buy as the wife will like it.  GREAT Theme, GREAT graphics, nice components.

It just doesn't seem like it's as fun as I expected it would be. 2nd game with 5 it was also pretty chaortic..my 3rd game with 4 however was more appealling as everyone was in with a chance at some point...further games have proved that it is a much better game when played quickly without overanalysing

Played a few times face-to-face (with 4 to 6 players) and on BSW. An interesting game, which can be played either very seriously and analytically, or in a more relaxed and fun way. I would rather not play it with too many players to minimize downtime and would avoid more than 4, so that every player can have 4 characters.

Fun little game with good art and well integrated theme.  Plays a bit long for what it is, and the complexity of the monster movement can feel like a chore sometimes.  It ends up being a lot of fun if you play with the advanced rules and don't over think things.

Similar in feel to Robo Rally, with a little more meat, and more chaos.  More strategic and less of a fun feeling about it, but it still has that casual game feel.

Great looking bits, easy to grasp rules, and several optional/advanced rules add some teeth, but there are some odd situations where your best option is to do nothing, or your options are eliminated by quirky board conditions.

I can't get enough of this one.  It's not exactly deep, but it's just fun.  I never get tired of romping my way through a crowded dungeon in the hopes of survivng the monster.  I haven't yet tried the advanced options (teleporters, turning blocks, etc...), but I'm sure looking forward to it.

RATING: 5
I have mixed feelings towards this.  On one hand I like the fact how you can bait the monster to create interesting and sometimes unexpected situations that will cause havok.  On the other, I really hate how little you can do without help to stop someone that managed to get ahead of everyone else. It is especially hard if others either doesn't or cannot plan ahead nor have a good spatial sense, because that will lead to decisions that could most likely be detrimental for the rest of the game.  Frankly, I don't think there is enough blood drawn each round.  I imagine maybe more players would partially solve that problem, but I believe this will always suffer from the effects of leader being able to run away with the game.

Though I was extremely unimpressed after my first play, I've recently played again and had a whole lot more fun with it (maybe I was in a bad mood the first time?).  In any case, I'd certainly like to play again with various amounts of people.  I think some of how it plays out also depends on your group, too.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fun game!  I can definitely see families having a blast with this one!

The game components are very nicely done.  If the villians/monsters were plastic miniatures instead of cardboard, I think this game would move up a half step for me (which is a pretty big deal).

The gameplay is fun and definitely hilarious!  Although it is easy for me to plan out routes in the hope to avoid th monster, I always get eaten!  That is what makes this game exciting and replayable!

Definitely consider this one if you are looking for a lighter game with fun mechanics.

Лучший филлер, который я видел. было бы голосование на филлеры, дал бы 10 из 10-и. 

Нужно провести свою комманду из одного угла в другой, не наткнувшись на монстра. Комната поделена на квадратные отсеки, по которым идёт перемещение. День сменяется ночью - от этого зависит максимальное количество шагов одного из юнитов. Монстр ходит столько клеток, сколько написано на случайной карточке. Замечательная игра.

UPD: недавно брал снова, желания играть не возникло - филлер, в котором становится не так интересно, кто выиграет. Gateway-игра, но не более.

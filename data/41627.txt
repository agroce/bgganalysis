GAME: Zulus on the Ramparts!
RANK: 1406
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's not a bad solitaire, but I don't really think it holds up to some of the other games of the State of Siege system. It is much more random IMO, and there is a bit of fiddleness in tracking the various strength of the Zulu tribes. What does save it, however, is an interesting discard/purchase card system and the fact that random placement of Zulu means more replayability.

States of Siege games are tough, and this is no exception. Things have to go right if you are going to win and you have to get your fair share of die rolls. The addition of being able to build up cards and then chain them together to reaaly adds to this game, making it a vry differnt experience to the more 'railroaded' feel of Soviet Dawn.

Solitaire Game.

Components (rulebok & cards) at first fuzzy and noisy but after you enter in the thing  .... You ARE THERE! in middle of the fight! Defending the Mission Station at Rorke’s Drift. 

Lots of action and narrative.

Probably a classic in it's kind.

45-60 minutes per play.

This is a Joe Miranda game, so that means you are going to get some good ideas.  Just like [thing=53624][/thing], this is a nice twist on the [family=3245]State of Siege[/family] system.  Instead of the cards acting against, the cards work with you and the chits that you pull are the bad news.  However, the cards are also the timer and the longer you take to go through them, the more likely you are to lose.
Fires and leaders make for nice chrome touches.

Best States of Siege yet. Terrific solitaire game. Lots of difficult choices, very hard to win, and plays fast. Well-developed theme despite the abstractions, and an unusual battle to boot. An absolute home run.

Edit: And yet I traded mine away to get the updated version...and have felt no compulsion to get it again.

RATING: 6.5
A random programmed single player game. With the random draws of Zulu chits, a second random draw of cards are used to battle or stop or delay the advancing counters on 4 tracks. 

It's a pretty nice game but can't help to feel that victory is only dependent on 3 random components (Including the combat die rolls) and their interactions throughout the game. 

The main idea is to draw cards as quickly as possible and as often as possible. 

These are the games where you move along with the story. Reasonable game but limited in actions and choices.

Very fast game with easy rules. Plays better then Keep up the Fire. It captures the feeling of the movie quite well. The game has a small footprint on the table and looks real nice. The optional rules are independent from each other and you can choose which modules you use. Two optional cards add events from the movie. If you play without any optional rules and cards you even can enjoy this in a quick session. The basic game reflects all important aspects of the historical situation. Beautiful.

Very fun and engaging game of solitary defense of the Rorke's Drift Mission.
- Tough decisions every round;
- Simple rules, quick learning;
- Fast playing (20-30 minutes);
- A very clever way of telling the story of the battle through the game's mechanics.
I'm afraid it might not survive after too many plays, but it sure will be fun for quite a while. 
Excellent game to take on business trips.

RATING: 8
El mejor juego en solitario de duración corta que he tenido. Se monta en un momento y además recrea una batalla que me encanta. 
Muy fiel al acontecimiento histórico, aparecen todos los personajes, todas las circunstancias y detalles (esta segunda edición contiene la expansión). 
Decisiones muy interesantes a lo largo de cada partida, con momentos tranquilos en los que desarrollar la estrategia global y otros verdaderamente agónicos con los zulús metidos hasta la cocina. Cada personajes tiene su utilidad si se sabe jugar bien.
No es fácil ganar, ni mucho menos.
Tal vez peque de tener un factor suerte elevado. Si no salen las tiradas de forma reiterada, hay poco que hacer. Igual que si no entran las cartas de un modo adecuado, o se enlazan varios chits activando al mismo Impí. Un jugador veterano, puede paliar puntualmente estas circunstancias, pero no eternamente.

En cualquier caso, muy recomendable.

Adquirida versión Ipad. Múltiples partidas en la misma, aunque está más logrado en tablero.

This States of Siege title brings you close in for a single battle. The hand management, heroes and chit draws are a decent variation on the formula. Plays fast and is enjoyable, but seems a bit more reliant on the raw dice rolls than other titles in the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.2
Great addition in the State of Siege series.

I rated Hapsburg Eclipse and Ottoman Rising a 9 too after around 20 combined plays and so - I am sure - will this game have the same replayability.

I do love the strategic grand scope of the other 2 a bit more than this "tactical fight" for a small redoubt. But frankly the game is as rich and story telling as its sister counter parts.

Even a little bit more fiddly, but I like that. The score may be adapted after a few more plays but my experience with the other games in the series shows I love these solo games of VP.

Why so high scores for rather small games ? ... Because they are PLAYED and offer fun and tension.

Ok die rolls are important but so are the choices and cards to be discarded or taken back into the hand etc...

Zulus assures me that I have yet to see a game that dissapointed me in the VP games offer. No pretention, no plastic, hard fun.

Played it 6 times now and the score holds up. To be played a few times per year on vacation :). Great one hour fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.72
Fun little game, very compact and light, I think I will always be grabbing this to take on hols. Each game feels different with the dice and order of the chits varying the pace at times. I like that my plans have to adapt to the chits and dice rolls and how it affects how I play my cards.

I like that if things are looking dire, or if you see an opportunity to polish off a unit, you can sacrifice heroes to fire a volley or do something else helpful, such as modify a dice roll. You've then lost your hero's special ability that helps long term. Short term vs long term, and a gamble either way. I love games like this with many quick, tough decisions!

Score may be on the rise, I started at 7 and after five plays it's now at 8.2 for me. I have yet to try the optional rules/cards.

Update: 10 plays in and I am having lots of fun. Rating up to 9 and I feel like it has a chance of going to 10. Still not playing with any optional rules/cards yet. It is one of those games where if I haven't done so well, I wanna play again right now!

Update: 28 plays in. Rating up to 10. I am now playing with most of the cards. The card play and choice of when to sacrifice is so delicious! With the variety of cards every game is feeling a bit different. For me this game has huge replayability and is a great choice for a game to play in 30-45 mins on the go. Footprint on the table is not that big, with the small board, and the box is dinky so easy to grab with you. It's fun to play and I always want to play another game right after finishing, especially if I haven't won.

The only negatives I can give:

- You need to be careful when assembling the standees. The slot on the standee base is too tight and will likely scrunch up the bottom of the standee. I used a knife to scrape a bit off the standing up part where it slots into the base.

- I paid £45, which felt a little high considering the board is a fairly thin jigsaw map. However, you get a nice paper map too, and if the game hooks you like it has me, it is great value. A highly addictive little game for me.

- The game included four dice yet you roll up to five dice for the volleys. It seems odd to only include four dice? Perhaps shipping weight was right on the nose? Very minor issue.

Other plus points:

- Artwork is pretty thematic, it gets me in the Zulus movie mood!
- The rules are pretty clear to me. Most or possibly all the questions I have had turned out to be in the rules somewhere.
- The laser cut counters are nice and thick. You do need to wipe the edges of the counters to clean off the soot, using the included tissue. Takes a few minutes and I am happy to do this as I love the counters.
- The game feels very well developed. It would be a good game with high replay value even without the optional cards and rules. Some games might have had the optional cards as an expansion. As mentioned in the negatives, the price is actually very good considering how much play you will get out of this if it grabs you.

A really fun solo game with a small footprint. Great to stick in the travel bag. 

A couple of bad chit draws at the start can have the Zulus rolling you up before you've had much chance to fight, but you're only out a couple of minutes and setup is very quick. Have another go!

This title has earned the place of honor in my solo games travel binder.

RATING: 6.6
Good solo game which offers a nice variety in strategy and command decisions in a streamlined and elegant fashion.  The decisions you must make can be very tough as you must choose between expending valuable cards, which iButho to target, whether to pass out more ammo/water, and whether to build barricades.  

Each turn features a single action so you will be sweating bullets as the Zulus get closer, trying to determine the least risky choice.

The only disapointing facet of the game thus far is the components.  While they are exceptional for the most part, the stand-up counters are nearly impossible to insert into their bases without damaging; I damaged nearly every single one (and I'm OCD about the condition of my games).  The damage isn't too noticeable unless you look where the standup connects to the base but it is aggravating nonetheless.

Saying that ZotR is not quite up to my personal favorites in the SOS Series - Soviet Dawn and Ottoman Sunset (though I am in the minority on this, according to the ratings) takes nothing away from this very innovative design. If you've seen the movie, if you haven't seen the movie - doesn't matter. Pick it up for a good gaming challenge that is colorful and evocative. Nobody will accuse the rules of being initially intuitive, but so what? After a few plays and a read of all the very helpful Session Reports on Geek, you'll be focusing on the game's narrative flow and tensely making critical decisions as you grimly hang on each turn.

I have only played one game so far but I really like how the personality cards interact with the game.

The siege system is very good, while the mix of cards give tension over the whole process.  For the first few turns, the player needs to manage several things at the same time, building the barricades, the reserve platoon.  I would like to make a bigger map and play with miniature soldiers.

RATING: 7.5
A fairly light but enjoyable romp through the defence of Rorke's Drift - very much in the spirit of the movie (quotes from which are included as flavour text on the cards). There is quite a slice of luck but there is also some reasonable decision making for the player to do that will influence success or failure.

Personally I could have taken a slightly expanded rule set to provide a bit more detail to the game but that was clearly not the designers intent and the game does what it sets out to do in providing a fun playable solitaire game of the battle.

If you like the subject then this is a bit of a must.

Solitaire game where the player has to defend the mission station at Rorke's Drift from a reserve iMpi of Zulus, who missed out on the fun at Isandlwana earlier that day.  Part of the VPG "State of Siege" system, but with some refreshing changes.  The Zulus come in using their buffalo formation via a chit draw from a cup, and the cards are now used by the player to deploy heroes and fire off volleys at the oncoming Zulus.  Quite simple to play, but very thematic and the game play is engrossing.  Probably the toughest of the State of Siege games to win.  Excellent, a solitaire gem.

[b][thread=430772]Variable Attention Span Reviews: Zulus on the Ramparts[/thread][/b]

(As of [b]8[/b] plays) A light solitaire wargame based on the defense of Rorke's Drift. As [i]Zulu[/i] is easily one of my top ten movies, it is no surprise that the theme appeals very strongly to me. The component quality is low and the luck factor is high, but there are enough decisions involved to maintain interest over several repeated plays. Extreme portability is a plus.

This game is tight, tense and addictive.
A very clean system and simple, easy-to-follow rules makes this a very enjoyable game.

The game also tells/enacts a narrative each time - that is different each time - and I enjoy that a lot.

Very tense, with a number of decisions to be made in terms of how to play cards and deal with oncoming hordes of Zulu warriors. Definitely a healthy dose of luck in terms of dice throws and chit pulls, but enough mitigation built into it to make it feel like a game you can somewhat control. Very easy to play, and with one of the most in-depth rule books I've ever seen. as well with solid ruleset. The components show their roughness but for a "Made in the USA" hand-crafted game, that pretty much forgives the component problems.

I was a playtester on the Gold Banner Edition of Zulu on the Ramparts. 

The 1st Edition was a roller-coaster ride — initially the Zulus seemed all-powerful, and any kind of victory was hard to achieve. With more experience, different card combinations became apparent, the limitations of Zulu movement became more exploitable, and victory became the "new normal". The Expansion game "reset" the playing field for a while — but again, the new options eventually overwhelmed the increased difficulty and the Zulus frequently became a milling mass of cattle corralled in a huge Kraal, ready to be slaughtered at the player's whim. The game never became risk-free — plenty of times I was "speared" early in the game. More commonly, I would achieve a mid-game position that was a virtual "checkmate" on the Zulus. The game was a great puzzle, but offered little resolution between Crushing Defeat and Super- Epic Victory.

The Gold Banner Edition may look very similar, but a great deal was changed to eliminate the myriad "loopholes" present in the original game. I apologize for being responsible for many a "pet strategy" being "de-fanged", but I think the end result offers a very tense experience, even after you have mastered the game's intricacies. My last playtest game involved a thrill-ride of a game ended with facing a "Morning Attack": being overrun, being rescued by the Relief Column, and annihilating the Zulus — were all distinct possibilities. Not only was it one of the most exciting solitaire games I have played — it was one of the most riveting game experiences I have had, period. 

It is not that good play isn't rewarded, far from it — but good play rarely leaves you so comfortable that a sudden reversal might leave you on the wrong end of a assegai. I know this leaves beginning players with even less chance to succeed than the 1st Edition — but don't give up hope, eventually you will see Zulu as a true gaming gem and victories will be richly rewarding.

It has never mattered much to me -- but the new Gold Banner components are top-notch.

Had this for a while but not played as yet. Other gaming priorities and life as a newly married man and all:).Components are good for the price you pay, not up there with the big companies but still pretty good. Fold out map is lightweight but sturdy enough, same with the counters. The cards are functional and easy to read. I need to play this and post an AAR on here! Rating of 8 is for components. Bumped up rating to 9.5 afer one play (the British won!) A fun game with lots of decisions to be made.

 Very good solitaire game with some options of what you can do on your turn but mostly you just try and deal with whatever comes up.
 The card play element adds alot as it can be tough to decide which cards to play and when to sacrifice your hero for their heroic event.
 As with any solo/co-op game you are trying to defeat the game system.Will not be possible to win each time as in any of these games you can get some bad card/tile/chit draws or dice rolls.

Very good solitaire game of castle defense.  Game play flows extremely well minus some clunky rules about heroes (they can be on the board, put back into  your hand, and then on the board again and then assigned to a task all in the same turn).  Will have good replayability based on the option rules.  Great theme and great inclusion of historical context/facts on every card really helps you get into the defense!

I also recommend Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp if you like this game.

RATING: 6.8
Warning! If you have deuteranopia (red-green colour blindness) you will probably not be able to read the pull chits correctly. You may have to modify them so you can read which horn of the bull is active. 
======================================

Zulus on the Ramparts looks as if its rules should be simpler. Ironically for a solo game, this is the sort of game that is much better learned from someone else rather than the rule book, because it’s easy to learn and to play, but a bit of a drag to learn from the rules.

I like the game a lot, and it’s definitely up there among the best solo games I’ve played. It is closely modelled on the film Zulu, which was what it drew me to it in the first place, because I think that film is one of the best war films made.

It is difficult to win, but not impossible, tense, with a sense of trying to keep a situation under control with wildly insufficient resources. The feeling of being in the makeshift, flimsy stockade is palpable. The tension (usually!) builds nicely as you find yourself fighting to stay in control under the onslaught, with tough decisions at every turn, including sacrificing your men. The roll of the dice can sometimes set you up to win without much effort, but the next game will certainly be a lot tougher…

On first reading, I found the rules layout made the game appear much more complicated than it really is, as I have now discovered. 

The card order can be an issue if you happen to have all the volleys stacked near the top with no way to access the heroes until it's pretty much too late. But therein lies the randomness of the game. It is what it is. The game is short enough to let that slide, but it has made me hesitate to look at buying other States of Siege games. One's enough.

Tentative as I've only played once. 

Very good game. Tense, vivid, spins a nice narrative, and just FUN. You really feel like you're under siege defending a fort against hopeless odds. I have the newer edition and despite the negative things I've heard about Victory Point's components, these are good. Colorful, artistic, and evocative. The cards even have plenty of historical flavor text which has educated me about this battle I really knew little about (admission: I haven't seen "Zulu".)

The decision making is a lot of fun. You generally only have one action per turn, so you'll be torn whether to spend it attacking, fortifying, etc. You can sacrifice heroes (ie discard them) to get powerful one time effects. This is a nice mechanic because it creates more difficult choices (should I let Private Hook bite the dust in a noble last stand , or save that for later?) 

So yeah, a caveat that I've only played once, but this seems like a winner. Best solitaire game I've played (EDIT: after more plays, this statement is no longer true, though I still mostly like this game.) 

EDIT: After many more plays, this game has a slight problem, namely, that the amount of randomness w/r/t Zulu movements can lead to a fair number of games where you either get run over on the third turn or, conversely, where you're never under serious threat. I've lowered my rating to a 7 because of this - still a decent game, but there are balance issues. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solitaire game with a very creative gaming system.  It really gets your heart beating.

I played it wrong the first 3 times I played it, so you'll want to look at the internet for clarifications after you read the rules (for instance, I think you can only use the abilities of officers once and then you have to discard them).

If you like this siege-type set up, you might also like French Foreign Legion or the Alamo.

Another great title from Victory Point Games.  I find that I don't like this one as much as Soviet Dawn because the story doesn't seem as epic as in SD.  That being said, this game can feel like eating potato chips since you'll always want to see how the next game goes, even after an epic victory.  I've got this one rated below SD but it fluctuates back and forth plenty and may wind up surpassing SD after a few more plays.  Who knows? The card play is interesting as well and gives the player plenty of options on a given round.  Excellent game!  Every board gamer should try this once (ok, a few times since the first few run-throughs are a little rough).

9/22/11 -- Update
Unfortunately, I don't know that this one stays as well as SD.  Not to take away from the game, but it does feel like I need to re-learn the game after stepping away for a while whereas SD gave me a completely different experience where I jumped right back into the thick of things.  Honestly, with a cheat sheet to get back into the game, this may not be a problem.

3/3/16 -- Update
Finally traded this away for the reasons mentioned above.  Soviet Dawn (for all its flaws) is easier to pull out and get into quickly.

This could go up to a 7. It's good, and it sustains interest for the whole game. I like the theme, and I like last stand type games. I had a  rules question I couldn't find answers to (later found it on BGG), but nothing that prevented me from finishing and enjoying my first game.

I have a minor concern that games will seem samey, that strategies will be obvious and that the Zulus will win early way more often than they should with certain chit draw combos.

But it's nice to have another solo game on a great topic, and it appears to offer lots of choices. I'll be playing it a few more times to see if it stays fresh.

This was quite a fun game!  Played so quickly (well, I got beaten so quickly) that I got in three games in less than 1.5 hours.  Atmospheric and tense, but I can see that there might be a limit to the number of plays given how short it is.  Still, a nice effort with some good mechanics.  The dice killed me in two games- how can we be heroes with no hits in 5 dice?

[u]03-Jul-2015[/u]:  This is one of VPG's States of Siege games.  It takes place at the Battle of Rorke's Drift in the late 1800s.  You play as the small band of British soldiers defending off the native Zulu iMpi numbering in the thousands.  As with all SoS games, there are several tracks which the Zulu will use to travel toward your last stand in the center of the board.

What makes this one a little different is the hand management aspect of the game.  You will have a hand of cards that include people and volleys (attack).  You will put some of these into play to activate them.  Some cards will come back into you hand when complete.  Some will be discarded.  And new cards will be drawn each turn.  Using these cards is the key to success.

The other aspect of this one that changes up the standard SoS style is the chit draw.  Rather than have an event deck to activate the enemy and determine your actions on a turn, you pull a random chit for choosing which enemy will move.  This is a quick and easy way to implement this action as well as having some of the chits be special events.  However, this can also lead to very short, very brutal losses as one enemy track can be activated several turns in a row.  Add in a bad luck die roll or two, and the game can literally end in 5 to 6 minutes.

However, it's just as easy to reset the game and start again.  Because when this game comes together, it's fantastic.  The tension builds throughout the run.  There can be a back and forth with the enemy advancing and fighting them off.  Using your cards to combo certain actions at just the right moment is so satisfying.  It's really great...when it's great.

Typical VPG quality with the thick, laser-cut chits and tokens.  The standups are a nice feature and make moving them around easier than counters.  And the historical text on the cards is an excellent, and informative, addition to a solid little game.

RATING: N/A
*March 2013* The rules do not do the gameplay justice. The cardplay means that you have quite a few choices and trying to utilize the cards to the best of your abilities is a difficult thing. I lost my one and only game.... and the weirdest part is, I didn't see that loss coming! Aside from the action limitation, it doesn't feel like your hands are tied. 

A different game than Dawn of the Zeds and a more suitable gateway, IMO. By no means is it light nor for anyone who doesn't want to think too hard. Great game!

*April 2013* Great game, but I enjoy DotZ quite a bit more, even though I own the first edition and this has much better components. DotZ 2nd ed is in the mail and this (and DotZ 1st ed) are for sale. So far I'm not overly curious about other SoS games but I'll give pretty much anything VPG puts out that's solitaire and gold bannered a fair shot

Despite my losses it was good fun and the game sure gives you an appreciation of the miraculous job the British did to hold the station....or maybe they just rolled well?

RATING: 7
Excellent little solitaire game that is big on gameplay but easy to get into and quick playing.

Each turn, a chit-pull determines the Zulus move or event. Afterwards the player can perform one action (or two if a leader is played) which creates some tough decisions that have to be made. Do I replenish water & ammo, fight a fire, make a hero available, fire a volley, build a barricade, or form a reserve platoon?  Card management and choosing the right actions are key to winning the game.  After the action phase, the player draws a card for his/her hand, up to five, then can "put forth" a hero as a free action (i.e., place a hero from his hand onto the table) indicating that it is available for use.  Heroes have special abilities that are essential for victory.

I find the game to be addictive and it will be the perfect companion on my overnight business trips - move over Ogre!

Only managed 6 turns in 2 games and only got to fire once across the two games before the Zulu's claimed victory. The game wasn't fun for me losing twice before being able to really do anything. Maybe I was just unlucky with the random chit draws, but it's not a game I'm interested in trying again.

Another hit in the States of Siege series! Together with Soviet Dawn, the best in the series (although both are quite different in scope and complexity). The subgame of choosing which cards to play/discard/return to hand is very rewarding.

Learning the rules. The first play was a surprise, fast paced and tense (zulu victory when the night fell). It's harder than it seems. Very good solitaire game with an unusual theme that is well depicted on the game.
Second play, political face saving victory.

Sold it to buy the second base game of Shadows of Brimstone. Good solo game though.

Want to like this more than I do.  Thematically great, but luck of the chit draw frustrates.  I certainly have strategies to develop IRT the best use of the heroes, but it's the 2 and 3 movement chits that occasionally hit at the beginning of the game that leave me without a real option to defend against.  Jury still out.

In my initial phase of learning "Zulus on the Ramparts" (late 2009/early 2010) I suffered through the rules for a time, but after rectifying those questions I was playing a solitaire game that nicely brings to life the battle depicted in the famous 1964 movie titled "Zulu".

Basically, the rulebook of this first edition (Victory Point Games has since come out with a second, boxed edition, which higher-quality components for a higher price) was less than clear, so I found myself searching for rules clarification or how-to-play videos on Boardgamegeeek.com, but eventually I rewrote the rules for my own understanding. In particular, the use of "Heroes," so crucial to success in winning the game, was fuzzy, but once I got the rules down I experienced a game that cleverly captures the theme and results in at times nail-bitingly close contests that can go either way depending on dice rolls. 

The designer also obviously did his homework in recreating this famous battle, from both sides. Not only will gamers familiar with the movie version recognize the famous soldiers and officers from the British side, but they will also learn much more about the culture, beliefs and battle tactics of the Zulus. In this respect it's refreshing that the designer pays homage to warriors on both sides of this conflict. 

For those gamers looking for a solitaire war game experience with plenty of theme, "Zulus on the Ramparts" delivers in evoking this famous historical and cinematic battle.

A quick, enjoyable game. I love the theme and the mechanics are interesting. It's a shame some games can end (in defeat) before things have really got going and it's a shame too that there isn't a better player aid included in the box. I still have to do a lot of rules referencing and that slows things down. Even though the cards will come out in a different order each game, successive plays still feel very samey.

Initial impressions of the rulebook: 1. wow, beautiful presentation, rich use of fonts, colors (including various text colors), highlighting, italics, etc; then 2. Much of the use of color is a mystery to me (in many cases I was not able to find a legend [maybe the wrong term] that described the use of font colors, highlight colors, background colors, etc).   I can't tell why some of the text is in red and why some text has non-white background.

As a couple others have noted in their Comments fields, the rules are vague in places.  

The game play is irregular enough that it's hard to remember some of the rules.   For example, when drawing a non-advance iMpi chit, do I then draw another chit and, if so, draw yet a third if the 2nd isn't an advance chit.  Do I return the first (non-advance) chit to the cup (sometimes it depends whether it is day or night)?   And, so on...

This is a really fun game!   Sometimes, I play 3-4 games in a row.   Each play is different, due to different iMpi chit draws and card draws.

I upped my rating from '9' to '10' after 90 plays.

I ordered this game on Monday before Thanksgiving from Amazon and I got it Friday that same week. That added to the awesome. 

This game looks awesome when you take it out of the box (2ed.) the pieces are well done and I didn't see any scorch marks from the laser cut pieces. The cards are pretty thick too, but I ended up sleaving them so they don't get worn down due to short game turn around and repeat play. The rule book is great and has a section on the design of the game and how it was born, which was kind of neat. After assembling the pieces and reading the rules I was quickly able to get four plays of the game in with a short turn around time. It took me that many games to win one. I don't however feel like I now have mastered the game and I don't feel it has lost any re-playability

I think this is a great game and I am glad that I picked it up. Perfect for a rainy day outside and stuck in the house, like today. Especially when no one is here to hear me yell ZULUUUUU! every time the iButho advance. 

I actually picked this game up to use in my class on the Military Decision Making Process with ROTC Cadets and I think it is going to work out well with the choices that need to be made every round. Each turn there seems to be no let up on the pressure where the choice of a wrong action can spell overrun and death. 

LOOK TO YOUR FRONT!!! AND GET THIS GAME!

VPG and Darin Leviloff's State of Siege System visit Rorke's Drift.  A nice wrinkle by J.Miranda to add the tactical cards allowing the player to try differing options while battling the Zulu hordes.  A very tense affair and very enjoyable with good replay options.  A nice little solo game to add to any collection.

Since a great deal of my gaming is done solo, I found this to be a nice addition to my collection.

Based on the Battle of Rorke's Drift, the game utilizes the VPG/Darin Leviloff State of Seige System found in [i]Israeli Independence[/i] and [i]Soviet Dawn[/i], with the addition of cards that allow you options in your tactical decisions while trying to stem the advancing tide of Zulu warriors.

A tense, tight game that has good replayability.

What a fun game! If you are interested in the period, I recommend this game highly. It makes a nice game to take on a trip and one to fill a short period of time. The cards and optional rules keep the game fresh. It is not like B-17 because you have decisions to make and plan. I suggest to you to get deck protectors for the cards, I don't think they will hold up well over time.
********************************
I understand the cards are better now in the new edition. I have it on ipad now and having a blast playing it. What a quandary of what to do with the private cards (not Hook) should I play them to get the re-roll or not so I can get to the Relief Column sooner.

Got this after hearing it referred to somewhere on here. Nice little solo game. Not too hard. Loaded with history. Designer did their research that is for sure. It is challenging and has a decent system. AI is pretty average, controlling your resources is where this game is at. Get's a little tense the closer the Zulus get. Kind of provides a little putting you in the battle feel. Pretty good game.

Really impressive. After some plays I realized the "brain effort" that went into this game. This combination of chit-/card pulling and the ever advancing Zulus results in a very tense gameplay. It has been very well researched concerning the historical facts and they have been implemented extremely satifying into the game mechanics. My biggest wish is that VPG´s aesthetic product quality will be on the same level as the content of their games... But the 2nd edition of "Zulus" is quite a good sign!

Fantastic solitaire game that really throws up a surpringly different set of challenges each game.

Although initially I was unsure of the rules, and couldn't figure out what to do when, by the second play this all made sense, and through some very luck chit draws that gave me plenty of time at the start to get barricades built and ammo supplied, I managed a win.
A nice solo experience in a small box. Great fun.

RATING: 6
Incredible flavor - you feel like you're participating in the movie 'Zulu'. Different mechanic for SoS as you manage your card hand.

Chit draw combos can create some strange results (I once lost a game after the first 3 chits drawn).

CSR winner as best DTP for 2009.

Overall nicely done, but there are a handful of other SoS titles that I'd rather play first.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is supposed to be the more tactical of the States of Siege games, Since movement of the enemy comes from the chits rather than the cards you draw.  I'm enjoying it.  I haven't played the other SoS game in my collection yet (Dawn of the Zeds) but I want to get some play experience here first before I do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Theme makes me cringe a little, but the gameplay is solid and full of interesting and tense decisions.  I'd say I'm a fan.

One issue that may change over time: I love the optional cards and would like to include them if possible, but the VP penalty for doing so is just brutal.  The first time I finished a game using them, I had wiped out an iButho, kept the others at bay, and had lots of men alive and nothing on fire -- yet I'd only earned a "Tragic Defeat" result.  That's harsh!

Actually the new china.produced version. Got it in the pledge manager for Renegade. The game is really fun, and for a state of siege game you feel quite in control with the cards you hold. Your heroes especially really drive the show. Surviving isn't the only thing, though, as you have to defeat at least two tribesor harm them all quite a bit to actually get something better than the historical outcome, so you have to work for it. The new edition has nice components and the game plays well - only the number of dice in my box was only 4 instead of the needed 5, which while irrelevant (they are standard D6), it still irritated me.

This is an excellent solo game with a nice compact map and a small number of counters.

I love the card play, there is some strategy needed here and games can feel really tense as the zulu units start to close in on all sides. Importantly it doesn't start to feel repetitive half way through like many solo games, mainly because of the variety of things you can do with the cards.

Not the greatest components but this is reflected in the price. For under £18 (including delivery from the States) the quality is more than adequate. In fact one of the few games priced low enough to sail through under the customs limit!

I enjoy this game very much as the theme is wonderful. I will admit that Zulu is one of my all time favorete films so i can immerse my self in the theme as it doesn't feel that it is tacked on.The game has decisions to make and i know in the three of the four games i lost i know why. the game is good to kill half an hour and although you can make it a 2hour game as you will want to do better than your last time. great game

I like Zulus on the Ramparts. Especially the ebb and flow. When things are quiet and the zulus don't advance fast, you know it's a prelude of darker times where they suddenly come in rushing. So you better be prepared! And yes you can get unlucky draws, both chits and cards, but the game is fast and I consider it part of that ebb and flow.

Excellent historical information!  Some degree of luck.  Nevertheless, forces you to command the troops and try to handle the uncertainties of the day.  It really feels like the player is truly trying to manage an "out of control" situation, wherein the player has to face the stress of trying to stretch resources without pushing beyond the breaking point.

The clever design of this game guarantees a different outcome every time it's played. It's a rollercoaster ride of brutal uncertainty where anticipating the worst and making the right decisions is critical (should I start building the barricade now or commit the reserve platoon?). I've been overrun and slaughtered in 3 turns, and I've held off wave after wave of attacks for only a minor victory; very rewarding! Because of that, I'm really love'n this game. The multitude of potential outcomes keeps me totally engaged. Well done VP Games!

I fell immediately in love with Zulus on the Ramparts! It has a great theme, which is implemented very skillfully, it features fun gameplay full of tense moments, and that rare, great mix of luck and skill which makes a great solitaire game. 

I highly recommend this game if the history of the Battle at Rorke's Drift is of interest to you, or you just want to try a tense and exciting solitaire wargame full of tough decisions.

The game is not one I play as much anymore, because you finally solve the game. Sure, there's a lot of luck in the game, and randomness due to card draws, but once you learn how to best play the game, the challenge is gone. Now I bring it out once a year or so, but after a few plays I recall how to beat it, and trounce it again.

Great solitaire game.  Sets up quick, easy rules, and plays fast.  Game play is tense and the zulus are relentless.  Victories are always satisfying.  On the down side, you can get slaughtered very fast in some games regardless of what you do.  Flavor texts on cards enhances the experience.

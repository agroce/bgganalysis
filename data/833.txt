Another brilliant game by Mark Herman.  The history on the cards adds that touch of chrome that makes card driven games such a big hit with me.

This is not really a historical sim: you need the cards to fall in that 1-in-a-zillion order in order to do that.  This is more of a "what if" look at the Civil War, studying what might have happened if the Emancipation Proclamation was signed at a different time, or never at all, or what would be the impact if Kansas was admitted in 1864, or what if Lee commanded the Army of the Mississippi?

The only reason this is not a '10' is because the results are often far from historical, which is fine, because it's not trying to be that game, but Empire of the Sun, captures the 'what if' AND the historical accuracy better, and while Washington's War is all over the place historically, the meta-themes of Fabian tactics, and commander frustrations are all there.  In this one, I wish there an annual requirement to drive on Richmond, rather than a single card, for instance, because no matter which "what if" scenario you are looking at, there is no way that Lincoln would sit on his hands and allow the AoP to sit in Manassas for 2 years and do nothing. Perhaps allowing the CSA player to grab the Onward to Richmond card and shuffle it into 20 cards from the draw pile and set aside and use as his draw pile for the year would solve that.

Outside of the river rules, it is really not THAT difficult of a game, either, yet captures a great deal of strategy.

I think if you play, you should use Mark Herman's 10-year anniversary suggestions for handling the blockade and amphibious assault cards in order to make it more historical.

To play with the Confederates is a difficult but not impossible job. You can't afford mistakes. But once you are acquainted with the rules, it shows a game of great depth. Note however that the rules are written more complicated than they actually are. Just a matter of careful reading (or rewriting).

For an ACW-geek like me this was an essential buy. In my opinion he game depicts the war quite well. You feel like Lincoln/Davis and the major generals at once, having to consider strategical as well as political decisions. And there are so many options with every single card you play, your brain will tingle at least the first couple playthroughs. If you manage to get through the thinck rulebook that is... But it is worth the pain!

a wrong made combat table for small battles allow to US to destry CSA army simply leaving 1 sp for zone. A lot of useless rules limit (without historical reason) the freedom and inspiration of players. Enormous presence of lucky (the is only one deck for both players). Much less good than VG Civil War is nevertheless a very demanding and intelligent game

This game has some clever ideas, such as the political will track, which provides some detailed tracking of impact of events on the political desire to continue the war (for both sides).  Also, the potential for generals to be killed in battle is a neat mechanic, although it also leads to pretty gamey tactics to bury good generals in stacks with lesser generals.  

The card driven mechanic is also cool as you cannot entirely predict what your opponent can do, nor what you are able to do at the start of a turn.  So the fog of war and the variability of resources and, abstracted, influence with the political leaders back home is represented this way.

It also has some things I am not a fan of.  The game feels very mobile to me, almost like an Afrika Korp in America at times.  Forces can march a surprisingly long distance if you do not ensure to post at least a speed bump along the way.  That feels wrong to me with a game at this scale.  There is no reaction opportunity if a large enemy force marches from, say, Pittsburgh, to Richmond in one action, even if you have a large force of your own within marching range to intercept.  Interception is in the game, but I am talking about crossing large distances unchecked.  This fluid dynamic does pressure the player to carefully place garrisons to stop it, but it still feels off that Civil War era armies could move so far, even if unchecked.

I found the rules rather difficult to follow and especially reference during game play.  Rules layout are very subjective, in my opinion, and these rules just don't work well for me.  I don't think the rules are hard to learn, but there is a lot of detail and trying to refer back to things to refresh your memory can be a frustrating experience hunting for the section or sections (not always in the same place) to clarify a question.

The CRT is more complex than I was used to, but I can't fault it at all.  It is just a matter of learning to read it and planning based on what the possible results could be.

Overall, I say this is a good game, but not my favorite Civil War game.  I prefer The US Civil War much more.  While it also is not perfect, it feels much more like what I expect the Civil War was like for its leaders.  As for Mark Herman CDG wargames, I much prefer Empire of the Sun over this game.

Compelling game. The political will mechanism is something that more games should adopt (losing battles bad for morale? Shocking!), the creation and management of armies and their leaders is also a clever elaboration.

"For the People" is my first experience with an ACW game.  I know there are people out there who are wild about the ACW, and study every battle and every political circumstance down to the finest minutia.

I am not one of those people.  But I have a strong interest in history in general and this game should satisfy gamers with similar interests.

I found my first two games to be highly entertaining.  Both games had a nice back and forth, and high amount of tension and a nice asymmetrical balance between the two sides.

On the con side I find the rules to be pretty difficult to grok (including the notorious river movement / naval control stuff).  The learning curve here is pretty steep.

Perhaps as a corollary to this I also found the play time to be longer than expected.  Some of that probably comes down to some analysis paralysis and as a usual I would expect the play time to decrease over repeated engagements but our initial games were about 15 - 20 hours long.

A CDG inspired by VG's The Civil War.  Unfortunately I preferred the original title despite all its warts.

Would love to see The Civil War re-released using this games mechanism for restricting wholesale removal of generals. (However I don't see this as even a remote possibility).

(The ideal way to play The Civil War would be with an umpire and "nameless" generals.)

The more thought I put into this game, the more it suffers.  It has the ahistorical nature of Paths of Glory minus the interesting chaos of PoG that often translates into fun.  For the People is proving to be neither a good historical simulation nor a good game.  I do not want to give up on it, but the more I read ACW history, the more ahistorical this game becomes.  The leadership system "works" for the game, or Herman would have done something else.  But to call FtP's representation of ACW leadership historically accurate is not possible.  Herman's bias, a bias that echoes many a voice from the past, is clear in his skewed ratings.  The totally ahistorical outcomes are evident because the game not only allows them, it invites them. For Mark Herman to shine, he seems to need a Richard Berg at his side.
_____________________________________________________
I'm in the process (a long one, I might add) of cutting & pasting some comments that I have read about For the People.  These first are taken from a detailed and interesting review--"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly." 

(1) "Suggestion - Either reduce the deck to 60-80 cards to ensure that certain cards are more likely to be cycled (ala Hannibal), or split the deck in half (55 Union, 55 Confederate) and further divide it into early, middle and late war cards if you want to force a more historical distribution (ala Paths of Glory)."  This part about each side having a deck of 55 cards is worthy of consideration.  I do not think the total amount of cards should be reduced.  The more "historical" options, the better, but the smaller size could help better ensure that some events are played.

(2)* No theatre restrictions. One of the nice things about TCW is that, while you can focus on one theater, you cannot do so at the complete expense of the other two theatres. This would not be a major issue, however, were it not for some other flaws."  

On face value, compared to Eric Smiths, The Civil War, this might seem true for For the People.  But unless you are dealt a fantastic hand--"Look, Ma!  I got me seven 3's!"--you do have "restrictions," as you cannot do everything that you want to do (there are always exceptions to this "rule")."

(3) * Leaders and ratings. While the leader ratings for the North are bad, they aren't nearly bad enough given the low variability of the CRT and unit strengths. We'll get to that shortly."  

Here, we have a strong difference of opinion.  Mark Herman, I LOVE this game, but your leadership ratings are not a choice, they are a travesty.  If anything, too many Union leaders are UNDERrated and too many Rebs are OVERrated.  Naturally, Lee and Grant are rated equally, and obscenely (in comparison with virtually the rest of the pack) high.  Q: Could Grant and Lee really be considered "equal"?  

And guess who is equal to Grant & Lee (not to be confused with Lee & Perkins)?  Why, old Stonewall himself.  And whose nipping at Jackson's heals?  Why, Old Pete.  Q: What is the largest force that Jackson ever led?  When Jackson was at his best, it was under Lee's direction.  And as for Longstreet, when he finally received his "independent" command out west, and out from underneath the shadow of Lee, he pooched it.But in the wacky world of FtP leadership ratings, you can send Lee out west (whereas in War between the States, you at least have the optional rule that keeps Lee where he belongs, in Virginia) and have Grant come to Washington in 1863 (once again, WBTS has the rule keeping Grant in the west until 1864).  You can have Stonewall tearing up the Mississippi Delta instead of the Valley.  To coin a phrase: ULULULULULULULULULULULULULULU! Mark Herman must have been reading his ACW sources backward, upsidedown or both.  The "usual suspects" on both ends of the leadership spectrum get the usual treatment, and serve as bookends on the farce between. 

(4)"* Some rules are too fiddly, e.g. "changing fortunes" (12.4). They need to be simplified or removed completely."  Yes, changing fortunes, which involves gaining or losing 2-3 SW points is a pain, but what else is "too fiddly"?  Drat those games that make us think, and we all know that thinking is much too hard for the brain; why thinking might even be hazardous to your health!

Here are some comments by Chad:
"-having good leadership in a fort makes it more likely you will lose a general.
-having your army lose a battle badly makes it less likely you will lose a general.
-crossing a major river into the face of hostile army is NO PROBLEMO.
-don't even talk about the CRT.
-If you cross from Kentucky to Tennesse from East to West, you don't cross a river. If you go back the way you came, you cross a river. yes."

Too funny!

Here is what I have to say about the leadership/command question:

Before I begin to Â“name names,Â” I am going to do an overview of leadership in FtP, as well as crunch some numbers to use for comparison. In Mark HermanÂ’s For the People, most of the significant leaders are in the game. Herman frames his idea of ACW leadership around :

Political Value
Attack Rating
Defense Rating
Strategy Rating

I am going to set aside the Political Value category (which has to do with the impact upon the Strategic Will for either side when a general is relieved of command) and concentrate on the last three. Generals are needed to move larger numbers of units (either corps or armies) and to initiate an attack (under normal land-based rules; there are exceptions with navalÂ–assisted combat/invasions, etc.).

The Attack & Defense Ratings are added to the die roll when combat takes place in which generals are involved (as they normally are). Given the design of For the PeopleÂ’s CRT, the casualties both sides suffer will often be equal or close to equal (hence one of the reasons for the flakÂ–Â“donÂ’t even talk to me about the CRTÂ”Â–FtP receives). The influence of a General can make the difference between winning or losing the combat, and, with a few exceptions, the loser has to retreat.

The Strategy Rating plays a critical part because of the nature of this Card-Driven system. Each of the cards has a number, 1, 2, or 3. Normally, the leaders cannot move unless the card is equal to, or higher than, their strategy ratings. Example: Little Mac has a 3 Strategy Ratings, Lee has a 1. Guess whose going to be dancing circles around the other, if he so chooses?

Given the way Herman has rated Union leadership, the Union effort, for much for of the war, looks more like an attempt to clean up a maple syrup spill, than an invasion of the South.

Before I get to the numbers, let me invite any Geeks who are good at this sort of thing, to offer suggestions on the best (and fairest, because I want to avoid Â“lies, damn lies, and statisticsÂ”) way to use such numbers for the purpose of examining ACW leadership as portrayed in FtP and the games that follow.

Some Â“Number CrunchingÂ” for your Â“viewing entertainmentÂ”:

Union Infantry Leaders: 20 Conf. Infantry Leaders: 17 (16 if Van D. goes Cal)

Union Cavalry Leaders: 3 Conf. Cavalry Leaders 4 (5, if Van Dorn becomes one)

I am not counting the cavalry replacements (seems more trouble than what itÂ’s worth)

Total Union Infantry Attack Rating: 19 Conf. Infantry Attack Rating: 19

Total Union Infantry Defense Rating: 23 Conf. Infantry Defense Rating: 20

Union Cavalry: 5 for both att/def Conf. Calvary: 8-9 att/7 for defense

The Strategy Ratings (not counting cavalry this time, only infantry leaders):

Union: 52, with an average of 2.6(!) per leader.

Confederate: 33 (32 is Van Dorn gets horsey), with an average of 1.9 (or 2 minus V.D.).

When one takes into consideration that some of the best Union leadersÂ–e.g., Sherman, Sheridan & ThomasÂ–do not come into the game until late, the difference in ratings is more pronounced. Sherman comes in on turn ten, of this thirteen-turn game, Sheridan on turn eleven and Thomas not until turn twelve. Clearly, part of this must be for the purpose of that mysterious concept known as Â“play balance.Â” Perhaps an additional reason is that some leaders, e.g., Sheridan, did not Â“come into their ownÂ” until late in the campaign. But Thomas (and I am hardly his #1 fan) was the Â“Rock of ChickamaugaÂ” and the real victor at Chattanooga in the fall of 1863, not 1864.

If it is a question of play balance, the whole issue could have been dealt with in the same way as Eric Lee SmithÂ’s The Civil War, where leaders are promoted, and, with some exceptions, improved in quality and ability, reflecting their growth as commanders.

Now it is time to Â“name names,Â” beginning with: Grant & Lee/Sherman & Jackson.

We might as well get these Â“Big BoysÂ” out of the way first. Most, perhaps a solid majority, would see them as the best of the crop (but my Â“conclusionÂ” is not done based on a poll, or on any kind of research among anyone; it is just a Â“gutÂ” feeling). Some might argue that Thomas (blah!) or Forrest (get real!) or General fill-in-the-blank should also be placed on this Â“pantheon.Â” If so, I would like to know. And, boys and girls (in the high school classroom it is Â“young men, young women,Â” or just Â“guysÂ” for brevityÂ’s sake), donÂ’t forget to Â“support your answer.Â”

Here are the Attack/Defense ratings for Grant, Lee, Sherman & Stonewall: 3-3. Yup, you read correctly. 3-3. Their Strategic Ratings are also equal: a 1. Lee enters the game on turn four, Jackson on turn five (and one smells trouble coming up the Potomac. Or is it down? Which way does this river go?), Grant on turn seven (Â‘bout time) and W.T.S. on turn ten, as mentioned above. Thus, McClellen & Friends have to deal with the Â“Dream TeamÂ” long (and in a seven round turn, it is long) before the Equalizer arrives.

It helps to keep in mind that I insist on a modicum of historical sanity when I play For the People (and all other ACW games). E.g., Lee & Jackson stay east. Longstreet can visit the west in the summer/fall of Â‘63, but RacierÂ’s house rule for him should be usedÂ–Old PeteÂ’s ratings drop like a rock. Grant stays west until the beginning of Â‘64, and Sherman must find his own path to the east via Atlantic and such (if he chooses to go east; he might just want to visit Mobile and sip Mint Julips all the live long day). I know there are a few other such house rules that I use. It just boggles my mind that Herman allows otherwise. The placements of historical generals should reflect the historical realities; anything else should be the Â“optional ruleÂ” or the Â“house rule.Â” It is not a question of, Â“Can Herr Doctor finally beat the Mighty Pei by having Lee surf up the Mississippi to capture St. Louis?Â” You might as well have a freaking rule that allows for White Supremacists from South Africa show up and sell AK-47's to Mars Lee. Then the Yanks will counter by having Professor Peabody & his Boy, Shermy, show up in The Way Back Machine, yada, yada, yada. If we are going to discuss the question of ACW leadership, letÂ’s deal, as much as possible, with historical realities (and genuine, not bogus, possibilities) or it just becomes a farce.

Enough of that asideÂ–more asides are sure to come your way (nobody said nothing about this Â“exerciseÂ” in cyber ink being short). Back to the Â“Fab FourÂ” and those 3-3's.

When it comes to how Grant, Lee, Sherman & Jackson are ranked, my issue is not with the fact that these four big boys emerged as the strongest leaders on both sidesÂ–though Jackson as an army commander raises a few thornsÂ–it is that in FtP they are equal in ability as represented by FtPÂ’s Attack, Defense and Strategic Ratings.

Was anyone, anyone, the tactical equal to Robert E. Lee? Set aside that whole prejudiced nonsense about Â“Lee was a traitor!Â” that appeared on another geeklist way back when, and look squarely at the history. There are a host of reasons why the body count for the Army of the Potomac was what is was (60 000+) during GrantÂ’s campaign against Lee in the spring/summer/fall of Â‘64. But if the Â“buckÂ” has to stop someplace, it has to stop with the General in charge: U.S. Grant. There was nothing subtle, deft or innovative in GrantÂ’s handling of the AoP. And if you are going to place the Â“blameÂ” at MeadeÂ’s feet (e.g., Â“Grant was in overall command, but he left that Â‘tacticalÂ’ decisions to Meade and his commanders,Â”) then you better damnwell give the credit to Meade for the ultimate victory, and I doubt that anyone will be willing to do that.

If you are not willing to lay the blame for the various tactical blunders that occurred during the AoPÂ’s drive south in the Â‘64 campaign at GrantÂ’s feet, then at least lay the credit where it belongs: at Robert E. LeeÂ’s doorstep.

What Grant did do, that proved a turning point in the whole bloody mess, was, after the battle in the Wilderness, to turn the AoP south, and not north, as had happened, campaign after campaign. No wonder the men of the AoP, despite the atrocious beating they had taken in the Wilderness, cheered Grant in the middle of the night as they marched south.

That brings me to my next point: was anyone the strategic equal to U. S. Grant?

Not Lee, not by a long shot. LeeÂ’s strategic judgement (backed by Davis, who shares the blame) was marred by a case of Â“Virginia Theater Tunnel Vision.Â” Lee only had eyes for Richmond, and his refusal (in the end, that is what it was, for if Lee had said yes, Davis would have said yes) to send nothing of substance to the west until the fall of Â‘63 helped the South to lose the war. And when Lee did step out of Virginia, controversy still surrounds the purpose of the Antietam and Gettysburg campaigns. Raids? Invasions? Holiday trips through the Appalachian mountains? Whatever the intention, the results were strategic victories for the North, and in the case of Gettysburg, Lee, the tactical genius bar none, got his hat handed to him by none other than Meade. Ah, good times for the North!

Grant had the vision, the foresight, the experience, and the will to step back and see Â“the big picture.Â” Grant took LincolnÂ’s (and HalleckÂ’s too) desire to have coordinated offenses/campaigns against the South and turned it into reality. Grant had the mental toughness to persist against Lee (a pit-bull was Grant), despite the body count.

Next on the list: Sherman. I take the view of Albert E. Castel (and is it shared by a minority or majority of historians?) who, in light of ShermanÂ’s conduct of the Atlanta campaign, has come to feel that perhaps Sherman is not the great commander that many thought. If you use Castel as your guide, you see Sherman overlooking important advice from Thomas that might have ousted Joe JohnstonÂ’s army much sooner, saving both lives and time (but the idea that Thomas could suggest anything that would save time just boggles the imagination, as well as the Â“Slow-trot ThomasÂ” stereotype that abounds). Castel also points out other questionable decisionsÂ–and mistakesÂ–made by Sherman in his most important independent campaign.

In the end, Atlanta did fall (but did Sherman send a thank you card, plus roses to a certain individual named Hood afterwards?), Lincoln won the election, and the Yankees got to see much scenery in the deep South. But is Sherman the equal to Grant & Lee? I think not, and I think this whether he enters the game on turn one or turn thirteen. Perhaps the best thing Sherman ever did was help convince Grant not to quit.

Now, we come to Thomas P. Jackson, old Stonewall himself. He is one of the great Â“what ifÂ’sÂ” of the ACW. He is right up there beside Lee, Grant, and Sherman on the pantheon of 3-3's. And he does not deserve it.

One of the brain-numbing aspects of For the People for Â“puristsÂ” (re: a guy who loves history and whose underwear is too tight) is that anybody and his grandmother (or her grandmother, if you prefer) can command an army. Just have five SPÂ’s (strength points) and an operations card (a two or three will do the trick) and--SHAZAM!Â–you got yourself an army (as long as there are still dance cards to go around). Why, B.F. Butler (and my highschool-sized brain boggles at what you could do with those initials, but I embarrass myself) could command the AoP while the Â“Dream TeamÂ” chases him all the way past this side of the 49th parallel.

Â“But Jackson is not Butler,Â” you say. No, heÂ’s not. But he is not Lee either. Unless he was in the Valley chasing a whole host of Yankee nincompoops, or under LeeÂ’s close direction (e.g., Jackson vs. PopeÂ–a ninny bar none; Jackson vs. HarperÂ’s Ferry = Jackson vs. 12 000 blue-clad ninnyÂ’s), we have little to demonstrate JacksonÂ’s fitness for the command of a large (large as measured by Confederate standards) army, like the ANV.

One thing the record does show about Jackson is that, unlike Lee, Jackson did not know how to handle his subordinates when they got feisty. His preferred method seemed to be to lay charges and ruffle feathers. Plus, Jackson, no matter how you slice your bread, was a bit of a kook. More than a bit, really. Why, one can just see him now, lemon in mouth, one armÂ–which one was it?Â–raised above his head to just hang there, standing on Little Round Top while he rolls up the Union left at Gettysburg. Ah, the good times of what might have been!

Under LeeÂ’s direction, Jackson was perhaps the perfect, and most deadly (much more so than Sherman working under GrantÂ’s leadership), subordinate. No wonder Lee compared the loss of Jackson to that of losing his right arm. But this is Jackson working under Lee, not beside him as equals. To lose the right arm is not the same as losing the head. And Lee is that head (forgive any mixing of my tenses that you might see, despite the fact that I am an English teacher; it is a loooooong bit of writing, and it is for BGG, not the faculty).

Thus, Grant, Lee, Sherman and JacksonÂ–the Â“Big BoysÂ”Â–could clearly be considered the best commanders of the ACW (and if you want to bring Forrest into it fine; give it your best shot, but remember he commanded calvary and what he did best was burn, destroy, loot, murder African-American soldiers who surrendered, tear-up railroad tracks, get subordinates angry enough that they tired to kill himÂ–did I mention the part about murdering surrendering troops? Forest would be a candidate for the most overrated of the good commanders. Note, I did not say the he was not good.).

But are these four Â“equalÂ”? No, but the way that leadership is designed in For the People means that you will never experience this reality. Grant should be the best strategist, Lee, the best tactician, Jackson the fastest, and ShermanÂ–Sherman?Â–the one who developed the most mature view of what it would take to win the war: the total destruction of the South. But how do you put that into game terms?

Next, I want to comment on some of HermanÂ’s Â“other doingsÂ” in the way of ACW leadership as represented in For the People.

For the Union, look who is rated at 1-1? Lots and lots of blue-clad yo-yoÂ’s who Herman has relegated to the back-seat (but not the trunkÂ–or dustbin) of the American Civil War:

McDowell, Schofield, Hancock, Reynolds, Halleck, Buell, and my beloved Old RosyÂ–W.S. Rosecrans. Meade used to be a part of this Â“selectÂ” group in an earlier edition of FtP, but Herman saw fit to improve him, probably Â‘cause Lee kept tarring MeadeÂ’s backside. The victor of Gettysburg can now rest easy in his grave knowing that he is a 1-2.

There are a few, perhaps more than a few, things that kill meÂ–JUST KILL MEÂ–about this list. First, thereÂ’s a name missing: MacPherson. Why? Because heÂ’s rated at a 2-1.

ULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULULUL!

MacPherson, who never commanded anything larger than a corps (and the Â“armyÂ” he commanded during the Atlanta campaign was nothing larger than a corps, but itÂ’s nice to have friends whose names happen to be Grant and Sherman), who got himself killed
Â–the doofusÂ–during the Atlanta campaign, is rated at a 2-1.

Reynolds and MacPherson both share something in common besides their choice of colour for their dayware: they both died on the battlefield. In MacPhersonÂ’s case, he blundered into some hostiles. In ReynoldÂ’s case, it was while leadingÂ–leadingÂ–troops into position in the early stages of Gettysburg. What Reynolds did through his command decisions helped the Union to save that vital first day. MacPherson had the pleasure of helping to beat up on PembertonÂ’s troops in the Vicksburg campaign. Boy, howdy, hold me back!

Look, I am all for saying that the ACW was wonÂ–or lostÂ–in the West because it was. But there were important battles that took place in the East. It seems that HermanÂ’s reading of the history books stopped with FreemanÂ’s for the East (You go Lee! Beat those damn Yankees! You whip Â‘em good!), continued with the West, and that was it. Hello?! If it was not for the fact that MacPherson was good buds with the head honchos in the West, we would not be having this discussion, because MacPherson would not be in the game. Period.

Now, letÂ’s return to the pack of So-So Yo-YoÂ’s who all share something in common: 1-1.

Q: What is McDowell doing in that list? The only thing he could do competently was eat gi-ganormous amounts of food, including the trick of eating whole watermellons, which he would declare Â“monstrously fineÂ” (I kid you not, or my nameÂ’s not Bruce Catton, which is where I read this little tidbit of history).

Then there is Buell, who deserves better (as anyone who has read Â“Most Promising of AllÂ” could tell you), but who has been tarnished by Â“popularÂ” history, which is quite often different from Â“realÂ” or accurate history.

Halleck, when was the last time he commanded in the field other than before, during and after the Â“evacuation of CorinthÂ”? LetÂ’s count Â‘em up. Zero. Yet, heÂ’s right up ther besides the likes of Reynolds and Rosecrans, ready to hit the (campaign) trail. Actually, For the People, and its concept/design of leadership, cannot handle the likes of Halleck.

Q: Where would Alexander the Great be if it were not for his logistical genius? Back in Pella, chasing woman (well, one can only hope it would be women, but I digress) and known as Â“Alex the Cad.Â” Like my old Pappy, I mean Nappy, used to say: an army marches on its stomach. And it helps to have bullets to put in those guns, blankets for those cold nights in Nashville and what not.

HalleckÂ’s logistical, administrative and organizational geniusÂ–yes, you heard it here first, folks, thatÂ’s Â“geniusÂ”Â–helped make GrantÂ’s victories a reality (IÂ’ll deal with the question of whether Halleck was a sneaky, double-dealing jerk another time). Plus, Halleck had a solid strategic vision. But a 1-1? As if! The only ACW design that knows how to put Halleck in his place by giving him a proper role is Army of the Heartland, which we be discussed later.

I could rant about RosecransÂ–and I will-but later on. The Confederate leaders are also a sorry lotÂ–poor Braxton Bragg! For the PeopleÂ’s not good enough for you, B.B.

Q: Based on your knowledge of the American Civil War, and your play of ACW games, how do you think For the People fares in its representation of ACW leadership?

On the whole, I think it fares badly. For the People is almost farcical in this regard. But to look at leadership is to look at but one part of the whole, and on the whole, For the People is a wonderful gaming experience (as long as one leaves out the AK-47's, Lee rides the Ohio, Jackson takes the A-Train to NYC, etc.). It is a great game and Mark Herman should be justifiably proud of it. As a wise designer, he knows how all the parts come together to make a whole. One only knows what would happen if one, ah hem, started Â“tinkeringÂ” with the command ratings in For the People. In addition, many of my problems with the ratings could not be solved by FtPÂ’s system. It would take a new systemÂ–new gameÂ–to bring the ratings to a historical justification (re: reality), while still having a real game.

Dissapointing game, overall. Not the strategic civil war game I've been waiting for at all. You fight a lot of battles, you win some, you lose some...but other than the CRT which tells you you won or lost, it is hard to see how it matters much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
The ahistorical atrocities (call them what you will, some things in this game should NOT happen when one compares to actual history) in this game can probably be overlooked by the beauty of the components and the design. If one does his best to put aside strict historical adherance (and don't get me wrong, it gets a lot of things right) and plays the game for the GAME, then one will enjoy many hours with this game. Currently I am trying it solo (I know, tough but fun) to get a better grasp on the mechanics, as multiplayer can quickly frustrate the newcomer against a good opponent. The design, as it stands, is fun and addictive in its nature. Not even close to Victory Games' "The Civil War" for me, but these are 2 separate games and everyone will have their own preference.

(April 2014)
Have to up my rating from an 8 to a 9. It takes a lot of play of this game (for me) to understand the designer's vision. Once that egg is cracked a whole world opens up for the player. The game design certainly lives up to its trendsetting reputation. I still maintain that the game's simulation value is small, although I do get what the designer is trying to say. Detractors need to understand two things about this game: (1) it is a tournament game and newcomers can be annihilated by experienced players (but such is the case with many CDGs), and (2) comparing this to the older Victory Games' "The Civil War" is futile. Fans of the older game (and that game remains my favorite to date of all time) often get frustrated with FtP because they try to compare. I have learned to appreciate both designs for what they are. The fact that they are so different is indeed what makes them so great. If one can put aside comparison frustrations, there is a LOT of fun to be had here.

I just got this because I wanted a campaign context for miniatures battles using Volley & Bayonet. I played it once before but never read the rules being taught as we went. It seem more challenging and chrome-filled than A House Divided (which already has mini-campaign guidelines in a older supplement). Looks like a nicely made and challenging game... but perhaps for its own sake and a bit too much for the mini-campaign approach. Might be able to use the event cards to give AHD more flavor. I will return here with a review when I play it a few times.

Came to this game years after it came out, and got the FTP II edition.  A splendid piece of work, that masterfully treads the line between strategic and operational, with enough operational/tactical color to keep the battles interesting, and a wide range of ops, strategic, and political choices for both sides.  I've played it 14 times, and usually in clumps of 2-3, because it grabs me every time I decide to clear the table and make time to play it.

The primary drawback is the length of time it takes to play. After that, the fiddling it takes to employ generals and keeping straight how the Strategic Will tracks work are the two barriers to easy play.

A fantastic and enjoyable game with what I found to be a long and unpleasant learning curve.  It took me a long time to like this as much as the other CDGs.  Now that I do, it's one of my favorites.

It takes a while until you "get" this game.  The river rules, and also the subtleties of the combat results table can be tough to grasp.  You'll probably be very frustrated not knowing what to do when you first try this game.  I know I was.

Back when FTP came out, it was one of just a few CDGs.  I don't think I'd have given the game a long enough of a try today, but back then, I was determined to learn how to play the game.  I'm glad I did.

Easily the greatest strategic/operational level rendering of the Civil War I've yet seen. The card-driven mechanic is perfect for reflecting the strategic decisons facing both Lincoln and Davis in the conduct of the war. The campaign game is a long play however, requiring devoted civil war buffs who are willing to immerse themselves in the struggle. (See my review by Bubslug)

The difficulty is above what I'm capable of playing. Paths of Glory is my limit of how complicated a game I can play.

edit: I read a post by Mark Herman (the designer) where he said that it's not the complexity of a game that prevents a person from learning a game, it's a person's motivation.
Anyway, that inspired me to learn this game. So I did. And I'm glad I did.
It has a lot going for it, and I'm falling in love with it.

Thought I am entirely unqualified to make this claim: This is the definitive American Civil War game!

Liking this game.

I have read a lot about the US Civil War of the years, so from a personal level being able to push around generals who I know over terrain that I am familiar with is great fun. 

How is it as a game? Well, in my limited play I think it captures many important aspects of the conflict such as the importance of rivers, the huge expanse of the territory fought over, the important role politics and public opinion played, the blockade, the superiority of early Southern command, etc. I know it has come under criticism in some quarters for not feeling like the war, but to this newbie it certainly did. 

One interesting aspect for me was that is was the first shared deck CDG that I have played that did not subdivide the deck into different periods. I was concerned about the impact that would have regarding the feel of the game. To be honest, I really did not notice a negative impact at all. Interesting...

I did not have any problems with the riverine rules as some have had; perhaps due to being cleaned up by the time I played the game. In fact, I thought their impact on the Southern options was fascinating. The combat takes some getting used to and is not as straight forward as jamming as many troops into the fight as possible. Leadership plays a big role in combat. Huge in fact. Learning the nuances of how to take advantage of that is neato. I have some concern over the impact, or lack thereof, of being OOS. Not that there isn't any impact....

The linking of the spaces, especially in the northern Mississippi and Tennessee area provides plenty of opportunity for thought. Strategic position comes alive there and I really like that.

PROS: I think it depicts the war just fine thank you very much. Furthermore, there are options here for both sides and exciting ones at that. A playable, fine game.

CONS: Tough on the South for a new player I suspect.

RATING: 7
The original AH version was borderline unplayable, the GMT version is much better. There are a lot of elements to For the People that are overwrought, as the 25-page small-type oft-revised rulebook would indicate, and the CRT and most anything involving leaders come in for particular (and justified!) criticism. The CRT particularly is not only not interesting, but the logic behind it is also (IMHO) wrong-headed. The river rules are painfully fiddly, as are the rules for political control. But, there is a lot of good stuff too, and the Strategic Will concept along with the card and hand management details are very nice. The event deck is well-designed in the GMT version. Somewhere inside the For the People package is a great game.

I rate this game a 7, and this should not be mistaken for an endorsement of some of the weird stuff that's in there. Some game elements, including the leader-loss rules and CRT, are not just strange, but to me, outlandish. In order to appreciate this game, you have to get past this and internalize the world the game is describing, and not use your American Civil War knowledge to play intuitively. But if you can get to that point, as I did in amount my third game, I think there is enough here to make the game worthwhile.

But Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, it is not.

3RD EDITION UPDATE: The 2nd printing of the GMT edition has more Strategy cards, which I'm not sure is a good thing, but what can you do (getting Emancipation Proclomation into play was bad enough with the old deck size). Otherwise, the game remains largely unchanged. The gratuitously huge number of control counters has been sensibly scaled back and replaced with more useful stuff.

RATING: 8
Not sure if it is the best Civil War wargame, but the Card Driven mechanism works nicely with lots of randomness.  Only really complicated part is figuring out the rules on crossing rivers and Naval control especially in certain key parts of the map. South's chances of winning really start to nosedive in 1863 I've found, but that generally follows the story i suppose.  If they get a good opening in the East it is possible to take Washington and the game.  Very good game

American Civil War politica / war simulation.

The 2014/2015 edition of this game has even better components, with a map that helps understand the rather obscure river rules a little better.

This would be a 9 or 10 for me, but  GMT's The US Civil War is even better. Still, "For the People" is worth playing to see how one of the first and best card-driven games works so smoothly, and (as someone who only recently took an interest in this era) for some of the historical insights on the cards. 

Batalo-ludo. Absolute re-ludebla.

I have a tortured history with this title -- I was an early adopter of We The People lot these many years ago, back when it was Avalon Hill's long-bomb attempt to make wargaming relevant for those of us in the MTV generation with the short attention spans and the Twitter and the sexting and the whatnot. And then they announced that the same designer was going to adapt the system to the Civil War, and I saw starbursts, and then Avalon Hill took the dirt nap and I couldn't find a copy of this anywhere. Then wargaming and I decided to take some time off to see other people, and by the time I lurched back into boardgaming as a hobby this had been reprinted and gone back out of print before I could get my mitts on it. So it's been 15 years before I could actually own the thing at which point I found myself in a lively and fun group of gamers, and wouldn't you know that it's mostly a bunch of Europhiles who have no love for the wargame, so it spent another few months with it on the shelf taunting me. So even though I probably would have rather played a game that we could have actually finished in the three hours we had available, I couldn't resist the temptation of FtP when my wargaming buddy showed up at the door. Which is to say: I've played this once, just the 1861 scenario, and I'm not at all certain I got the rules right yet.

If you're way into the Civil War as a subject (I am), and you are particularly interested in the interplay of politics and military maneuver (I am), and you don't have the time to crack out something monstrous and comprehensive, but you still want something historically plausible and strategically interesting (I don't, and I do), For the People is where it's at. This game is delightfully unscripted but has just enough chewy flavor of history that your intuitive moves will not steer you wrong. I enjoyed my playthrough of a one-year scenario that went under three hours despite many fumbles with the rules.

What For the People is not is We the People Redux; the war is too big and too sprawling to be successfully comprised by that game's simpler ruleset. There is a lot of chrome here, mostly in the service of denying players an easy way around thorny real life logistical problems of the actual war. We didn't get to do too much of a deep dive into these problems, but the game does seem to do a decent job of emphasizing the importance of river and rail transport without absolutely burying you in minutae. Some problems are insoluble aspects of the medium, especially the thorny problems inherent in the fact that the players have an ahistorical knowledge of which leaders are actually worth a damn and which should be assigned to the coastal defense of Kansas. For the People does its best here, and it's questionable as to whether it can be done better without just binning the idea of the leadership of individual generals altogether, which would just feel WRONG to any Civil War buff worthy of the name.

I'm not yet ready to slap the "masterpiece" label on this one yet, certainly not before I can take the training wheels off, but I heartily enjoyed my introduction and I will be very sad if it's another 18 years before I play this again.

I have played this game twice now in the past two weeks, and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The first game was played until Turn 11 or 12, at which time my friend and I decided to stop since it was a learning game anyway and we had royally messed up our strategy on both sides with both capitals getting captured.  The second game was a down-to-the-wire game session at BGG Con.  While I have raised issues about the blockade and how it was implemented, the fact is that the game appears very well balanced irrespective of any complaints.  Both games also played very differently.  This game is a time-monster and took about 12 for each game.  A statement to compare this game?  A Paths of Glory for the Civil War--though truth be told, I think For the People came out first.  The best game I have played for it's operative scale and timeline (strategic level, entire Civil War).

This game is difficult to rate under the BGG system because I will probably not have the chance to play the game very often due to its time constraints and complexity, not because I don't want to.  As a CDG game of the ACW, it excels.  Taking the time factor out of my calculation, this would be an easy 8.2.

UPDATE 03/20/2010.  I have upgraded this game to a 9, though might reduce its score at some point.  I am currently playing two more games via Cyberboard/VASSAL and I am loving it.  I am still trying to get into a game as the CSA, since the CSA appears to be the much more challenging side to play well.  Still, I am completely addicted to this game at this point.  Huzzah, Mark Herman!

03/12/11.  Update.  I am in the midst of a full game as the CSA.  We are winding up the 11th turn, and the game is going to be a Union win.  I still want to play it out to learn how not to lose.  The game has told a great narrative so far, and I have learned a lot - both what I should and should not do as the CSA player.  My confidence in this game continues, but I am feeling ready to move on to other pastures.

Haven't had a chance to play a full game yet, but some early impressions: I love the political control and strategic will aspects--essential to understanding the war at the strategic level. However, I wish the game somehow reflected the historical escalation from a limited conflict toward total war (as Paths of Glory does with separate decks) and tied events (particularly Emancipation) more closely to this escalation--it seems to me that this is critically important to understanding what the war was about in the first place and how the conflict evolved. I'm not sure the game gets Emancipation or Foreign Intervention quite right.

(2007-10-31) Substantial improvements over the Avalon Hill edition.  It is a great combination of historical flavor, interactive play and near continuous need for difficult decisions.

It has its distractions -- the mechanism for possible leader losses, the possibility that one player will draw several campaign cards in a row, and the fact that with good play many events simply will never get played are a few.  Also, there is a lot of details that just seem to pile up that you need to keep track of.  However, for me those are small issues compared to the game's strengths as a highly competitive and sophisticated game that actually does a good job at recreating the war, militarily, logistically, and politically, at a high level.

I will never turn down an offer to play this one.

GMT Games.  This polished, card driven, war game is an amazing simulation of the grand American Civil War from start to finish.  Events that took place, generals that fought, fortresses, grand armies, naval power, politics, economic forces dictating ability to recruit, train and bring more soldiers into the conflict - all of these elements are present.  The area movement system is realistic enough for logistics and lines of command at the time.  Competition for the border states is present in the early part of the war.  As both sides ramp up their military forces, history usually repeats itself in this design with invasions to the north (like Gettysburg) and the final grand strategy of cutting the South in two along the Mississippi by the North if a normal competitive game is played.  Generals can die and can have a large influence on future battles.  And the political system is well designed and illustrates how war weariness could have brought either side to collapse no matter what the actual military forces in existence were capable of in the later part of the war.  This game feels like the war as it developed historically and in a normal game, how the military might of the North eventually put a strangle hold on the South and put the South into a pressure squeeze by 1864.  If you are looking for a moderate level of difficulty Grand Civil War war game, For The People is the game for you.  I like the modified cards in the latest edition and the enlarged map.  This is the latest GMT version of the game which had its roots in the Avalon Hill game of the same title.  This fantastic card driven war game has made my list of top 50 war games I enjoy playing of all time.

It is my favourite game. 

As in many other civil war games, availability and abilities of the higher generals structure the conflict. 
I know it is an endless struggle but I would like to see some variability in the arrival time and choosing of the generals. There is no natural law about Lee taking a field command in the spring of `62. Or about Cleburne sticking as a divisional commander with the AoTN.

This is about the extent of rules overhead I can "manage" in a game I enjoy. That said, it's a great gaming experience. I can see why this is a classic among USCW games and among CDGs. Really needs a lot of plays--I don't feel like I'm playing very well at all. 

After now having read the rules to The US Civil War, it looks like it has all the same rules complexities (and maybe even more!). It has complex river rules, various terrain hex sides that affect movement of armies, and most confusingly, it has numerous special cases for areas of the map (mostly along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts). It's now making me think FtP is the easier game to understand.

Edit 2: Now having played TUSCW twice (1862 scenario, base game), I definitely want to come back to FtP. I was correct in my anticipation of TUSCW being just as complex (or more so) than FtP without any more enjoyment payoff. While they are both good games, I feel no desire to play TUSCW over FtP, but I'm a CDG junkie.

Just about one of my favorite games.  A nailbiter to play, almost infinite replayability, and a fascinating look at the ACW from a strategic level.  The naval rules give particularly good insight into that aspect of the war, and the strategic will mechanism feels just right.  Is it too easy for the South to raid?  Well yes, and if that bothers you (it bothers a lot of people) then FtP isn't for you.  But a must look for an ACW fan.

This game is a mess. Amazingly bad and confusing river rules, boring and misguided CRT, inaccurate leader ratings, no theater restrictions, chaotic card draws, outlandishly bizarre leader casualty rules and poor strategic movement rules make this game a total dud. How many revisions has the rulebook been through? The river rules are so awful that whole threads have been dedicated to explaining them, only to result in even more confusion most of the time. I don't think anyone truly understands them.

Even if we ignore the rules issues, the reverence people have for this game baffles me, as you will regularly read reports of the South riding into Indianapolis or Lee capturing a heavily defended and fortified Washington D.C. As a simulation it fares badly against Eric Lee Smith's [i]The Civil War[/i], which has yet to be topped, despite its playing time.

Ultimately, this is a game that can't decide if it wants to be a simulation or just a game. It tries to do both and succeeds at neither.

This is one of the better ones, but also one of the more complex. The setting is the American Civil War, with the United States of America taking on the Confederate States of America. Lots of flavour and chrome here including historical generals, armies, corps, divisions, river and naval rules and so on. All the events you'd expect are here as well. The leader placement/movement rules take a little digesting, while the river control/movement rules are guaranteed to give you indigestion (considering the amount of work that's been put into them over the past 10 years, you'd think they'd be clear by now!).  
The campaign game will take a full day, at least, but there are yearly scenarios provided. This game is the second edition, following on from the Avalon Hill edition that appeared the day before Monarch/Avalon Hill went under. The GMT edition is much better in every respect.

GMT&#039;s last version - 2.4b - comes close to perfection.  An excellent game that combines great respect for historical context with a vast array of strategic possibilities.
The combat system is strange and allows for results that are easy to predict and thus a bit less exciting, and the Leader loss mechanism can be avoided or exploited in a gamey way, but the overall flow and feel of the game is authentic and challenging.

Overall, the game is good. It brings out the uneven contest between the North and the South: The Union player has many options to explore, while the South get more and more desperate over time. However, that's not to say this game is great. The rules are fiddly to the max: the leader rules are almost impossible to keep track and implement. And for the Union player to get the Emancipation Proclamation card is total luck-of-the-draw. I'd like to see GMT or some other company take a better stab at this, as there's potential, just more development work is needed.

Un juego resultado de la mezcla de The civil war y cartas, que da lugar a reglas extrañas (fase de reemplazos solo al principio del turno que crean situaciones inesperadas, sin limitación en el uso de cartas por frente, reglas navales muy complicadas, bloqueo a la Confederación dificil...).

Los eventos se suelen utilizar muy poco.

Stretches the limits of the system, and is weaker for it. I get that Herman wanted to emphasize the leadership over force sizes, but this seems like a pendulum swing too far in the other direction, with unbeatable stacks run by awesome leaders.  Forces are incredibly mobile, which may or may not be historical, but isn't a ton of fun. The deck is entirely too large, and the events are much too specific, so it gives most plan a generic feeling.

I'll acknowledge that I played poorly, and a lot of the nuance went over my head (especially the naval stuff. Hooboy!), but the game isn't a whole lot of fun. If I'm looking for a strategic-level ACW game, I'll play the eponymous hex-and-counter game or A House Divided. Both evoke the flavor of the war and remain playable in a way that this doesn't.

Yes, yes, yes. For the People is an excellent balance of history and what-if. The card driven mechanism allows players to explore a bit of both, creating their own version of history.

This is a good Civil War game. In fact, I'd rate it as one of the better ones. I enjoyed playing it and I would be happy to play it again. 

However, it does have flaws.

First, the cards are not spot on target. For example, the events don't usually build on each other. In a really great CDG, such as Hannibal, the events you are dealt each turn seem to fit naturally into a possible plan. That just doesn't happen here to the extent one would wish. 

In addition, how a card affects an opponent's "Strategic Will" needs tweaking. Simply put, players start with 100 points each and events usually only cost your opponent 1 or 2. So why bother? Newbies end up playing a CDG with few events. Now I assume good players don't take this path as even 1 or 2 points per card will eventually have an effect, but why not structure the situation so that most players don't take this path either? In other words, why start with 100 points? If you just started with less (say 25) and got more as the war went on, then even new or average players would worry about the early-war political situation as much as they realistically should.     

Second, should it really be necessary to discuss the terrain around Cairo and Dover for one full page? If it's that complex a situation it might be time to change something, as compelxity should have a pay-off and there just isn't one.

And finally, I'm not yet convinced of the wisdom of some of the designer's more unusual decisions, such as his General Officer casualty sub-system. As things now stand, the better your army is, the more likely your general is to become a casualty. I'd assume that the more desperate the situation is, the more likely it is your general will take a hit. Think of Pat Cleburne, Phil Kearny or Stonewall.

The bottom line is that this is a solid game marred by slightly too much complexity and slightly too little bang per card.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
After just 1 play I really think I get this game. Enjoyable and intriguing I find this one to be well worth owning someday. The river and naval rules are somewhat complicated in detail but are actually easily grasped in concept. As long as you always go back to the concept you can understand the rules quite intuitively. 

My only gripe comes from the leader loss mechanic where the better you roll the more likely you are to lose a leader. That in itself doesn't annoy me but actually it's the modifiers to the die roll that tick me off. For instance if you cut your opponent from his supply line you receive a +2 die roll modifier (drm) which means, yes you will do better in the battle but also your leader is more likely to get killed. Why oh why, does your opponent's lack of ammunition cause your leader to be more reckless with his life? In the same vein, sitting in a fort also grants a +2 drm to the exact same effect. Why does hiding behind a wall make your leader more vulnerable? It doesn't pass the smell test.

But, in the context of the whole the leader loss bit is just a very minor annoyance. For the People is an awesome game!

Ok, it appears to me that some game dynamics are spoiling the system. The North has to work early in order to face the arrival of the confederate generals "dream team" in 1862 or mathematically loose Washington: this is doable by exploiting the CRT quirks ... On the other hand the South could loose instantly Richmond if the North gets the right card combination the early turns and concentrates all the forces, possibly by deploying two armies in Virginia ... In both cases you have a sort of sudden death situation. Third possible option is a frustrating stalemate, given the ability of the South to neutralize any offensive thanks again to a much superior leadership. Either way to me the game just starts lacking appeal. Too bad! What a waste for such a design and production! At first sight FTP seemed having a lot of potential. Not so anymore after having played a few games.

Rules are heavy.

I think the politics of the war is captured better than in the Victory Games offering through leadership rules, capture of states, and the ways in which fortune swings. The deck offers great card options, but given the complexity, I'd like to see the decks separated the way they are in [i]Paths of Glory[/i], but that is my preference.

I do have some problems. The naval rules are clunky and I think they could use a good streamlining. The CRT is great for the early war but a bit flawed (although not broken) for the later war. Leader ratings seem way off.

I wish I could go a point higher on this.

I want to add that the generals are scripted, but you can change them out for a small penalty which adds to the tension.  The map is amazingly designed and the tracks sized well and laid out nicely.

Masterpiece. 

Best strategic level American Civil War game by far. Outstanding tourney each summer at WBC. Innovative design with about all game actions tied to strategic will. Probably one of the best pure maneuver games I have ever played; too few units, too much space (this is good). WILD swings of luck due to single shared deck with some killer cards, key interception die rolls, etc - so not for the feint hearted. Mr.Herman continues to provide outstanding support to the game after 10 years and the discussion board on consim is always lively and worth a visit.

I don't like gamey stuff, and I'm not a fan of 'CDGs' with a premium on knowing the deck and the inherent false choice between some scripted event or moving troops, so am not pre-disposed in the first place.

Wow. The more I play this game, the more I realize just how huge it is. The first time you're faced with the wide open map and your relatively few units, you're overwhelmed with the possibilities. Where do you start? What should you focus on? The cards obviously help to limit the possibilities somewhat, but in some way this limitation makes the choice that much more difficult. You can never do everything you want to do, so you have to be more careful in picking the [i]best[/i] combination of actions. The game also clearly plays completely differently for the two sides, so learning one side will do little to prepare you well for playing the other side. 

The full campaign game does potentially take a long time to play. This doesn't bother me but it does make it a bit difficult to schedule a game (VASSAL helps here). The single-year scenarios do seem interesting, however. I've only played 1861 and it moved pretty quickly and can probably be completed in an hour or so by two experienced players.

I fully look forward to continuing to dig into this game. It's an absolutely brilliant design that merits deeper study.

I've got some serious reservations on the balance of this game.  It plays NOTHING like the way the Civil War really played out since the Union can't do ANYTHING in the first 3 turns other than stack people in the NE to prevent Lee from essentially steamrolling.

The game is an excellant view of the Civil war from the 10,000 ft level. Many abstractions were made that will annoy some gamers crazy  (i.e. the 'Ever Victorious Army of Northern Virginia') but it works in a game where each player is a President.  Each time I played I felt like I was making strategic decisions for the correct reasons, not for some game related reason.

The ultimate strategic game. For the People manages to be both historical in the way the war goes on, and having an incredible replayability value. I have played it about 50 times, and never had the impression of doing the same thing over and over again. And still, the "narrative" of the campaign is always perfectly credible. A brilliant game.

Funny - this game rates a lot of 10s and a slew of 2s.  Both seem extreme to me.  If you're a gamer, you may like this game.  If you're looking for a historical simulation, don't play it.  The learder rules always compel me to send Fremont into the northwest with a token army just to get him out of the way.  The cards have all the possible political events, but then you shuffle them together so that events that were absolutely destined to happen may never turn up.  OK to play, but I don't look forward to playing it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Classic CDG about the American Civil War.  Fantastic fun,  tremendous replayability, and outstanding tension, but there are a few aspects of the game that don't feel quite right and always seem to result in odd situations that don't make historical sense.  This is bound to happen with any historical game, but the more you know about the history, the more difficult it becomes to swallow them.  Tenth-anniversary rules (appearing in an issue of Ci3)fixed some of the more glaring issues in this regard.

RATING: 7.5
Interesting expansion of the card driven system into the ACW era.  I absolutely love the basic engine of the game here but I feel that much of the additional chrome detracts from my enjoyment.  River movement/control and the leadership hierarchy in an army/corps are two particularly bloated areas that should be trimmed.

RATING: 9
I was not a Civil War buff originally.  With increasing reading about the history I am more and more interested in it and more and more games about the history were bought. This strategic game should have been purchased long before when it was re-released.   However, I already have "A House Divided" and I am afraid of a too-scripted card-driven events. After the game arrives, the doubts have all gone.  This is definitely a game of deep strategy thinking.  Plus Mark Herman, my favourite game designer, in the tradition of his excellent "Peloponessian War" and "We the People", I just can't put aside the temptation to purchase it.  With all the positive reviews so far, this could be the definitive, and possibly the best, game on the American Civil War at a strategic scale.  The item has been put into GMT P500 system for a reprint.  So preorder it at their website and boost it up to 500 preorders asap!  I have downloaded and read the living rules from the internet before I purchased the game second hand.  Initially you might be sidetracked by the extensive rules on leadership (which ACW is very much about) and river operations (running the gun, naval invasion, forts and ports rules).  The combat and political will aspects of the game cannot be taken lightly.  The designer is determined to show the war as is from the historical perspective.  The game demonstrates that Union and Confederate have different advantages in all the important strategic and tactical elements.  Leadership and resources are basically the elements that separate the two sides.  Political and special events are played out by the use of cards.  So once in a while you would expect something different that might chart a different course in your game strategy. All-in-all, this is a must have for the Civil War buff.  Even if you are not, buy this game too for a good learning in the military history of the American Civil War.  You bet, it is more exciting than reading a book as you are experiencing the entire war.

I gave it an 8 after playing it two times. I will probably upgrade my rating after more play. It's a good game but I really think that the player aids should include well more informations. I'm always looking at the rules looking for some details, exceptions. I even begin to wonder if there's not a missing part in my game box. Why two Lincoln's Gettysburg Adress? One would have been enough, but I'd really like to get one more player aid with a resume about generals, rivers, naval movement, rail movement, etc...
As I said, it's a good game and I want to play it more, but it's annoying to have to look at the rule book so much, especially for a game not that much complex.

A good card-driven strategic US Civil War game.  The rules are a bit much for a card game, but the fiddliness does at least improve the game play and provide more theme.

RATING: 10
Best game in my collection. The card deck provides a very strong historical flavour. All the decissions you have to take in a turn are really taugh (tactically and strategically). Where to defend, where to deploy, how to build your armies, which General do you put in charge, how to prevent the Union to freely move across the rivers, how to prevent raids from the Confederate, how to mantain your Resource Spaces, how to manage your Divisions, Corps and Armies. Almost each and every action will have an impact on the Strategic Will of every side. Once your Strategic Will reaches certain point, you quit the war and the other side had win. A Master Piece.

One of the best card-driven wargames.  It is a very tense game of relatively evenly matched sides.  If you are looking for a nice modern take at a strategic level of the ACW, this is a good one.  I am ranking this medium-heavy instead of medium, because I have found new players have a lot of difficulty "getting" the game.  Once you have gotten a feel for the breadth of the game, I think you can play pretty competitively though.

RATING: 10
I love so many of the mechanics of this game, and it's probably about as good a game on both the military/political aspects of the strategic war as has been done. Yet, it still seems overly complex and fiddly for what it is, and I'm not at all sure that the single 'event deck' for both players is the best way; perhaps having a separate deck for each side (a la Paths of Glory) is preferable....? Very ambitious, and very well considered, however, as all Mark Herman designs are. I have days when it seems like a '9' or '10' game, and days when it seems like a '6', so I gave it an '9'. (note: I have revised it to a 10...it's one of the best games I have played)  Not a game for a beginner, it's harder to play than the length of the rules would have one believe. I've only played the GMT version.

Edit: just received the '14/ '15 reprint after having only the original GMT release for many years. It is just beautiful, the map looks better than ever. Mark Simonitch is one of the best in the business. So happy I bought this edition. I will never be a good FtP player (some people out there have a truly frightening skill level, testament to the quality of the game), but even so I find this design endlessly fascinating. Each new game provides a new narrative of the war, while, as Mark Herman demonstrates in his example of play in the rules, the game is quite capable of an historical storyboard as well. A landmark that has stood the test of time.

I enjoyed this game very much. So many tense decisions to make. So many things you can do and that you want to do. But, you are constantly finding that your opponent's moves prevent you from doing those things that you want to do. Loved the card play, how every game could play differently depending on your cards. Loved the generals and the agony of not being able to order them, or just in deciding whether or not to relieve or reassign them. Loved the balancing effect caused by different sized battles. You find yourself hoping for a large battle, but unable to attack since it's only a medium sized battle, etc. Loved the Strategic Will element of the game, the sway back and forth, the winds of war, the attrition, the PC control aspects of the game, etc. I could go on, but for your sake I won't....

Perhaps Mark Herman's best game. It was a very good game when published by Avalon Hill but the improvements made with the GMT version pushed it to 10.

The game plays similar to VG's Civil War game, especially in the way generals are handled and combat units (with a few imporvements). The card system however adds a level of historical feeling that I've not experienced in any other Civil War game. It takes the military battles and places them in context with the rest of the events of the Civil War surrounding them. 

If you are a civil war buff and looking for a good game to similate not just the military aspect but historical context then this is the game for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great game, I find it hard to believe it isn't rated higher than it is.  It is a very deep game, and due to the large playing area, variety of mechanisms for movement/attack, and card-driven aspect, seems to offer a variety of strategies.  The rules are long and at first, somewhat confusing.  After a full game though, and a good amount of rule-searching, it will come-together.  After that point, I think you will find it well worth your effort.   
To me it is in some ways similiar to Hannibal, but offers much more depth.  The only downside to this game, like Hannibal, is the one deck of cards.  The randomness of the single deck can, and will, result in lopsided hands from time to time.  This can have an effect on the outcome of the game if there are enough lopsided hands.  Fortunately there are enough turns in the campaign game that this doesn't seem to be overly prevalent.  Besides, a simple house-rule or two can largely address this issue.
At the time (8/08) FTP is my favorite game.

Big ACW opus that mixes combat, politics and a solid CDG format to explore what-ifs scenarios in the era. I find a limit in the river rules, it makes sense but I keep forgetting how it works after a while. Along with Civil War (and nowadays, Simonitch's U.S.Civil War) it's a classic.

A provisional play only, thanks to the generous "Dutch" Raspler. A lot going on that I know I'm going to like, but it seems a degree more complicated than my comfort zone may tolerate (rivers, southern ports, the CRT, creating armies, etc.) However, I simply think I need a good, solid read of the rules, a knowledgeable, patient opponent, and either an online or ftf play.

A masterpiece? Probably. Still I'm not that much into ACW to give it the attention it deserves. Rules are top notch however and the couple of playing it had were serious fun... still, if you don't know much about civil war you lose most of the chrome behind the various event, which is a shame.

Simply not my cup of tea. Too frustrating with both sides, even if you are winning. I had a game there both sides were claiming that they had the more frustrating part, the North because it lost the battles and the South because it lost the generals.

The model for countless other Card Driven Games.  The cards are not overpowered and thus the game is very enjoyable solitaire.  The game moves at a brisk pace and the playtime is great for what it is simulating.  Not the easiest game to learn, plenty of exceptions and details, but well worth the effort.

Super super fun game.  I now really enjoy this every time that I have the privilege of playing it.

The only downside is its complexity.  Overall, it is not overly complicated, and the principles can be taught very easily... but things like generals and the riverine rules can only really be mastered after a bunch of gameplays, which makes for a steep learning curve, IMO.

Still, AWESOME game.  No joke.

I like the card driven series, but this seemed the most traditional wargame of the type, with lots of chits to move around, difficult to work out best options and consequently a long affair. Which is probably fantastic for most, but the game wasn't "bound" enough for me and I moved it on.

RATING: 6
A card-driven ACW game that just doesn't seem right somehow.  The card mechanic doesn't seem to fit the period as well as others, the deck is quite large, and the events too disconnected from history sometimes.

I've also issues with other features of the game like the appearance of key Union Generals and the lack of automatically increasing Union pressure on the naval front.

While this is an OK game, I don't find this as satisfying as other games about the period and would prefer to pull out my Victory Games "The Civil War" for a strategic ACW game since it "feels right" where this doesn't.

Regarded as a classic, it has a great game system, but I always had issues with it; the US always seemed to win, not with a killer strategy, but with almost any strategy; the generals all seemed to be 3/1/1 or 1/3/3 with little inbetween, I disagreed with the attack/defense values of most generals anyway; and fortifications rarely slowed a campaign. I came up with a long list of variations to solves these problems for myself and my regular opponent, but I sold it when I kickstated Lincolns War.

I have the AH edition and modified it using some of the rules from the GMT edition. This game has a lot going for it. The cards provide a lot of flavor and captures the stops and starts of Civil War campaigns. The idea of strategic will captures the political nature of the war. The use of political values for army commanders make decisions to replace ineffective commanders much more difficult and costly.

However, the rules have lots of exceptions that make it a difficult game to play. Also the rules are poorly organized which made it extremely difficult to play an error free game. Infact with the AH rules I don't think I have.
It also has some serious issues - leader rules, leader casuality rules, battle calculations .. - expect to write a lot of your own house rules. 

Updated to the Gmt version - splitting the defensive/offensive modifiers help defense and is a welcome change. The river rules and maps were cleaned up in the AH version they were incomprehensible. The amphibious assault rules were also improved. Replacement cavalry leaders at least prevent an unlucky break to be permanent. Making it more difficult for the Confederates to build forts, while easier for the Union helps offset the superior confederate army.

However, there are points I question.
The leader casualty rules based only the number on die role modifiers? 
Somehow interception and retreat before combat shouldn't be equally 
likely.
The crt is extremely narrow and very much influenced by modifiers.
The total discounting of numerical superiority, especially in light of the strength already included for leaders, forts and interception - looks to be a double counting. 
The vastly superior confederate initiative not only allows for movement for defense (as it should). It allows for strategic offensives. I've seen too many marches to the Great Lakes. Could the confederates really be able to supply their army deep into Ohio or Pennsylvania? They were very limited with what they could do with railroads, and were strained to perform even the limited counter offensives into the north.

Every Civil War buff should give this a try and those looking for a unique experience for two players will be happily surprised with the depth of this title.

First, I respect those of you who enjoy FTP.

I love CDG, especially "Hannibal," "Napoleonic Wars," and "Wilderness War."  "Hannibal" was especially elegant and encouraged me to buy FTP.  I had no games on the Civil War, and this seemed to be a fix.

Thus, I wanted to like FTP but found it a mess.  Every rule seems to have an exception and the thinking into the "force (un-)multiplier"  modifier in the CRT is simply flawed.  (I think this was well noted in "Paper Wars," an old war game review magazine).

FTP shows how CDG can be stretched beyond the breaking point.

Perhaps a multiplayer 2 v. 2 game (Union West and East versus Confederate West and East; thus, 2 sets of hands a la "Clash of Monarchs") would have made more sense?

RATING: 3
For the People simulates the ACW on a strategic level. By playing cards you move armies and trigger political events. Winning is determined by reducing your opponents "strategic will" so much that he will surrender. That all sounds neat. Unfortunately this game is almost unplayable. Leaders have a political rating that determines who is in command over armies etc. This is in itself not a problem as politics was a factor in the war. The problem is that the system is clunky and fiddly. Another problem is the poor river crossing rules. I am an experienced wargamer who have digested enormous amounts of rules, and games like World in flames or OCS pose no serious problem for me. But those darned river rules broke me. I just do not get them. The third and perhaps worst problem is that the events are underpowered. You almost always use your cards to move armies. This takes away the political dimension of the game  somewhat and reduces it to an ordinary wargame. I also do not like the combat system which I find boring and uninteresting. I had som hopes for this game as I am a big fan of other card driven games but I feel that For the People fails in using the card mechanic and ultimately also fails in providing an interesting game experience. There are far better games on the ACW-era out there.

Much like the other CDGs For the People rewards fine play and will be quite balanced unless the cards get flukey, and the cards are not all that unlikely to get flukey.  That said, it is a fun system, and the ranking of the generals and playing to a general's individual ability brings a lot of color to the game above the flavor text on the OCs.

The map is engaging. There are some great balances between efficiency of movement and cutting off supply lines. Plus there are a number of fun pinch-points to go for (Damn you Paducah).  I certainly need to play this again.  I suspect the rating will go up.

Good theme play.  Need a couple of plays to learn and develop strategies.  The combat system is unique to CDWs, breaking battles down into small, medium & large.  Leaders and armies are also treated more intricately than most CDWs.  This game offers much more depth than the typical CDW.  Game is fun.  The components are fair - colorful paper map, thick chits, and marginally durable cards.  The rulebook is fairly well organized, clear and has good examples.

One of the best wargames I've ever encountered. Models a complete war with relative ease of play (despite the design's inherent high complexity) and near perfect presentation. 

There are a lot of little rules to remember, so preparation will pay off here. Note that GMT rates this as Medium complexity (5/9), and while that may have been true for the 1st edition, the game has evolved significantly over the years (now more like a 7/9).

Lots of cards, lots of strategy options, lots of fun - great, great game that is remarkably thematic.

Empire of the Sun made me look for other Mark Herman's games, and FtP lived to the expectations being one of the pioneers of the CDG mechanics: Great game. Agonizing decisions and very tense, it's being played a lot and studied with quite a Chess like approach.

Another great GMT card-driven game. The game has a nice mechanic called Strategic Will which takes into account the war-weariness of both sides. This can create a great tension, especially late in the game, when you might need to fight a battle, but the political consequences of defeat could put you dangerously close to losing! The generals, reinforcements, and sometimes the cards (Forward to Richmond card forces the US to attack) help keep the game in a historical framework.

Also an excellent game.  I find it just as enjoyable as The Civil War.  One of the reasons I find the Civil War to be somewhat better is due to the hex grid.  It gives you more freedom with your armies.  Since FtP is a point to point game, this lacks to a certain degree.  Besides that, the games is very well designed and keeps both players attention.  Quite a nice game to introduce someone to the strategic aspects of the American Civil War.

RATING: 7
a very developed and rich game on the Civil War, which has the rare quality of being playable in 2 sessions (or a very long 1).

The game needs to be played some times to reveal all its subtleties nevertheless

Nevertheless, somehow, the game doesn't feel right (for example, the battle CRT has too weird results for me, the generals are too important regarding to the soldiers and so forth) and it becomes really frustrating over time.

I can't swallow the fact for example that a small army (for example 3 SPs) with great generals will consistently win battles against foes largely more numerous and inflict losses more than their own strength even if they are annihilated in the process.

These strange quirks affect the game too as the Northern armies are really too weak (because of their generals). they can't win battles, or very rarely so they must win by sheer attrition (losing 2:1). It doesn't serve the game ultimately (both sides seem to block each other) nor the historical simulation (where North seems to be consistently better than in the game)

Other criticism : apart from a few exceptions (campaign, blockade, naval move), the events are not interesting and I almost always use the cards for the operations, which removes a part of the interest of a CDG.

In conclusion, a nice game to play if proposed but maybe too insatisfying to be my strategic American Civil War of choice. Blue vs Gray gives me a far more satisfying experience for a fraction of the time.

Theme... lots of it.  Tough for me to compare to my normal Euro fare.  I like it... a bunch.  Fun decision tree.  I have played once, so I haven't decided a firm opinion.  Expecting it to go up, as play time decreases and familiarity with the rules increases. 

Desire to play again = really bad.  I need to fix everything I did wrong, so I can come up with new reasons I played so poorly.

Sometime during my first game, when I was trying to develop a strategy to get a good supply line to the deep south with protection from my opponent, this euro gamer was hooked on this game.  The extra rules do add flavor and theme, so they are worthwhile.  Great theme and execution.  Must get in more plays.

Wow, I really enjoy the CDG mechanic.

The rulebook really does make the game out to be much tougher than it is.  The threat of the South taking Washington DC must loom large.  Very good stuff, however.

Some rules are not user friendly at all & difficult to assimilate.
But once you get it the game is a real challenge. The fact that it is a single deck gives the game plenty of replay value. Strategic options are also numerous. Balance is very good. One of the best CDG.

"For the People is a grand strategy game of the American Civil War covering the conflict from Texas to Pennsylvania, from the firing on Fort Sumter to the end at Appomattox Court House. You take the role of either President Lincoln or President Davis and command the armies, promote and relieve generals, conduct amphibious assaults, dispatch cavalry raids, and even battle incompetency and political intrigue among members of your own cabinet.

Very good CDG on the American Civil War. The best part; the political tension put on keeping/relieving bad commanders and the economical/political system built into the Victory conditions (National Will).

Not the best game on the Civil War, but manages to portray the full conflict with a fairly simple set of rules. But beware the rules about river control, they are close to undecipherable.

Too many rules for too little effect.  The process of placing individual SPs as reinforcements, only to move them to your armies desperately needs streamlining; the river control rules are rather opaque; game strategy seems to overwhem any sense of ACWness. I can see why people like it, but it's not for me.

Sadly, I can't justify playing this one after having purchased Blue vs. Gray.  There's nothing wrong with it, but when I can get the same level of excitement out of a much easier [notwithstanding GMT's questionable complexity ratings to the contrary), more manageable game, I simply never put it on the table.

This game is a masterpiece. It takes awhile to learn due to all the chrome, but it was necessary to produce such an accurate game that has tons of depth and nuance. the mechanics are sound and the game immerses you as the virtual commander in chief of either the CSA or USA.

can't recommend enough if you like the Civil War history and have at least some knowledge of war games or just like a good war game.

Bad balanced (favor Union). Poor simulation. Very fun game. But it is only a game, not a correct simulation.  
More negative points: 
 - it has the defect of all the card-driven games that use single deck : the luck factor in the cards weighs too much. 
  - complex rules for a card-driven game
  - many gamey maneuvers without a actual sense of strategy or operational.

Positive points :
  - wargame very popular
  - using VPs bid system is good competitive game.

Read the rules and then played 1861. We enjoyed it alot and want to get this back to the table. Played 2nd game and got through 1862. By 3rd game, starting to get the hang of strategy - could've saved some time by reading strategy articles, but enjoying learning it. We're getting better and faster. See my session reports.

Not as much fun as the Union, it stinks to have lousy leaders.  Welcome to Civil War gaming, eh?  Would prefer each side had their own deck, a la Paths of Glory, as certain cards (blockade) falling into the CSA's hand make it much harder as the Union.  Good system, overall.  Political will rules are very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
A tough game all the way around, but rewarding so far... on a different order of complexity from Wilderness War, and the CRT everyone bangs on does force a much different playing style than one would expect from a game of this magnitude.  Still, though, does provide the visceral experience of managing all of the disparate elements of each side's war strategy, and will see the table with increasing frequency as the 150th anniversary of the conflict draws closer.

There's something Fundamentally wrong with FtP. Talking with a friend about possible variants, we can never hit on exactly what it is. I think the problem may just grow out of the inability to move as the Union. Unless you put Pope or Burnside in charge of the AoP (and you'd be insane to do so) you'll mostly average 1 chance a turn to move the AoP. If while moving the AoP you get intercepted, your pretty much out of luck and will almost never beat the ANV unless it's really poorly commanded.

Playing the Union, it doesn't feel like your playing against the Confederate player. Instead it feels like your playing against the cards and the dice.

Played it a few times. Great game; history is weak in an ACW game that favors a CSA aggressive policy in  Northern territory as the way to victory. The popular support for this was not there, nor were the logistics or the desires of the Chief of State or Generals (until the very overrated Lee). Was not even an option until after Chancellorsville, though the Press of the Union hyped up 1st and 2nd Manassas all out of proportion as serious threats to DC, which they were not. For a historically accurate strategic warfare game on the American civil War, get Victory Games 'The Civil War'.

I am a huge Civil War buff have been since I was a kid.  I really think this game captures a lot of the flavor of a grand strategy Civil War game (grand strategy war games are another passion of mine). It isn't perfect the rules are not really difficult but playing the right strategy is. That is why I gave it a Medium-Heavy weight and rating of 9 out of 10. This is the definitive Civil War Game for me.

RATING: 6
The leader replacement rules and political ratings work well, as does the political will track. I don't like the way the blockade is handled, or the counter-intuitive CRT, or the "blitzkrieg" breakthroughs. The shared card deck is a bloated morass of effects, and the rule book is hard to follow. Still, it's a very functional CDG on the U.S. War of Secession by the creator of the CDG genre. A good game, but not quite as good as Paths of Glory. I draw the comparison because both games are better as games than they are as simulations.

Path of Glory o For the People. Dos leyendas vivas llenas de carisma y personalidad. La dificultad de acercarse a ellos es proporcional al gozo desorbitado que producen. Memorables en todos sus aspectos. Si has dado un paso firme en los CDG's con TS, no temas seguir tirando del hilo.

RATING: N/A
UPDATE:  My one play was ultimately disappointing and the game was quickly relegated to the second-hand market.  

6/18/07 - Man, my desire to play this game is tantamount to having to pee really, really badly.  But I think I have a complex.  I start getting the shakes every time I open the box to fetch the rules and I blame everyone here on BGG who bitches about how complicated this game is - and what I'm afraid of is spending the time to learn the game only to forget them before I have a chance to play since I don't have any willing opponents available.  So now For the People just sits on my shelf, mocking me, knowing it's beaten me before I ever had a hope of any other outcome.  But...I plot my revenge.  One day, after I've learned/played all other games, only For the People will remain, and by then I will be strong enough and wise enough to smash its insolence with my game-comprehending might.

1st edition was poorly developped and even 2000 edition was unbalanced.
In 2006 edition, the game finally achieved its goal and now is the classic for this theme.

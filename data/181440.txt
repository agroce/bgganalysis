Mind Fitness Games does it again, re-inventing and re-imagining a classic game (in this case, tic-tac-toe) with new rules. Compared to the other games of theirs, this one is quite subject to the luck of the draw, though, at least in the way that we are playing it. The amount of tokens and the rules indicate that a less risky playstyle with more strategy is possible, too. We haven't been using the extra goal cards and other variants, too. This might be worth a 7 with more plays, at this time I give it a 6.

Very smart abstract game. Resembles tic-tac-toe, but takes that simplistic idea to a whole new level. Luck matters in a very small amount, just to give the game diversity and depth.

Thinky quick deduction game. Definitely would recommend this over love letter for 2. Haven't tried 3+ yet.

Neat little 2-player game.  Players are playing tic-tac-toe but the board is arranged in a magic square and you place your dude based on the sum of the last two numbers played (0 - 5).  If the other player's dude is already there, you take it and can use it later to have him tell you the sum of the cards in his hand.  

It's a small deck of cards (18) and two are out from the beginning so it's all about playing the odds.  There's certainly luck to the game, but since you play to 5 points (1 point per game), it evens out and it's still done in about 20 minutes.  

I like it.  Doesn't take up much table space and it's quick.  Vying with Mr. Jack Pocket (and maybe Court of the Medici?) for date night out time.

Like a game of tic tac toe with more strategy. It's fine to play, but it certainly isn't anything worth spending lots of time with.

RATING: 7
A cross-over between tic-tac-toe and a fixed deck deduction style game. Really neat, easy and quick, with lots more nuisance than meets the eye. Unsure how long its appeal will last and have not played it yet 3 or 4 player or its variant. It could go even higher. Solid and recommended, especially considering its low price point. Should be also good to play with kids that are learning arithmetic.

Buen juego de deducción. No se le saca todo su jugo con solo un par de partidas. Creo que tiene bastantes matices escondidos y hay que jugarlo más para encontrarlos y disfrutarlos. Quizás le suba la nota cuando domine esos matices, gran juego.

Hand management paired with tic tac toe. I guess it is a serviceable filler. The theme is really pasted on and the gameplay is only meh. Luck of the draw feels strong despite the few tools the game gives you to mitigate it.

Not sure what to make of it. I believe the variants to be extra games. 
the base gumme can suffer from luck of the draw in starting hands. Getting three cards for a total of 14 or 1 at the start of a round isn't really helping you.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This isn't a bad partnership game but probably not best played late at night after a day's worth of hard gaming. It does involve a bit of deduction and a memory element and the more one remembers, the more it is beneficial to the team. At various points, one can ask for the sum of someone's cards (all cards are values 0-5) and figure out likely hand cards to inform future play. A number of tricks are then played on a tic tac toe board with numbers where one wins a point by being the first team to get three in a row or three in a stack.

I've been playing a few card games, but this one specially got me.
Easy to learn, but hard to master.
I learned in 5 minutes, but to play it at highest level, will require at least 10 games played.
I recommend it!

This is a really well designed game that I like best with two players. When I am in the mood to bring a notebook and think through card combinations and probabilities and then map out a path to victory this game is second to none. I have a hard time finding others wanting to game in quite this way however and the game falls flat for me when played more casually.

Evoluzione del Tris, profonda delusione di questo gioco che ai più è invece sembrato un vero gioiellino. Io l'ho bocciato senza mezzi voti. Gioco tremendamente condizionato dalla pesca delle carte. Ingovernabile. Necessita solo di un po' di attenzione, tattica poca e gioco che a me è parso ripetitivo malgrado la durata minima delle partite. Poteva essere il filler dell'anno ed invece mi ha deluso.

Simple card game where you are trying to out wit your opponents. Trying to connect 3 of your pieces on the board by playing cards to get the matching values. 

There is some memory and deduction going on. We just played the basic version but I think there is some potential to get interesting with more advanced rules. 

Interesting game with nice colors!

Tic-tac-toe like win conditions but placing pieces requires summing last played card and your newly placed card.  3 of each number 0-5 exist in deck so keeping track of visible information and using captured tokens to ask opponent for the sum of their hand can lead to trapping them into a no win scenario able.  The 2x marker allows you to capitalize on being able to see ahead and protect that piece while ensuring it is part of your winning condition.

The game is not awful, but the choices are limited by the cards you have in your hand and, since you can't play the same number that has been just played, sometimes you find yourself stuck because of the limited choices available.
Components are OK, but could be improved.
It becomes interesting if you consider that the price is quite low.

151117 I think I just don't like chess games.  Even in my most recent run of iphone games explorations I just didn't play this one.

100103 Because I grew up with this game, I prefer this over chess.  I also like it more because it feels more fluid.  Its one of those games maybe I should rate lower given my personal fun preferences, but still a traditional classic must have its due.

RATING: 9
In the West we view Xiangqi as a variant of our chess, when its actually had a stable ruleset for much longer. While both are excellent games, I prefer Xiangqi. In chess, opening preparation can be more important than creativity and attacking flair. The opening, provided it is played reasonably well, is not as critical in Xiangqi and the open files and absence of locked pawn chains make for an aggressive game. The endgames are more interesting (and complex) than in chess. All in all, this is a superb classic and deserves much better attention in the West.

It's like chess, except you're in the thick of battle from move two. I play this on a casual level, and it's fun beyond description. Cannons fly, chariots charge and elephants... well, they kinda limp around in a passive-defensive way, but still, elephants! Lots of cruel tactics can be discovered on-the-fly, and I like that checkmate can be delivered with very little material.

The only reason this isn't a ten for me is that the soldiers feel a bit pointless. They've never been of much consequence in my games, but I play at a very low level.

Known to me & my girlfriend as Chinese Chess, I believe this to be much more fun than the chess I grew up knowing.  The unit movement is more unique, and the cannons add a whole new depth of strategy.  (must jump over one unit to attack another).

Xiang Qi, while can be translated as "elephant game", should be more accurately deemed as "abstract game" for the character "Xiang" does mean abstract in this context. A main difference between Xiang Qi and International Chess is the nature of combat -- Xiang Qi resembles a proper war rather than a field battle. A river separating the two sides, the HQ where the king resides and is confined to, no promotion for all pieces (maybe except the pawns which can move sideways upon entering enemy lines), and the "guards" which can never move across the river are hints that Xiang Qi is not like a field battle (ala International chess). I'd rate 7 for the normal game including the numerous variants such as "Blind Chess", "Turn the Flagpole" (a Xiang Qi-Chinese Dominoes crossover), and "Xiang Qi Mahjong", which often are fun to play.

RATING: 9
I believe that this chess variant is better than its western counterpart.  Almost from the beginning one is thrown into a dynamic struggle due to the more open and tactical nature of the game as opposed to western chess which can bog down in lots of positional moves.  Also Chinese Chess does not require you to have to learn a large opening repertoire just to make sure you stay even into the middle game.  I've only played a handful of times but look forward to playing more to see if my enthusiasm is justified.   I was going to start stuydying to try to become decent at Go but Chinese Chess seems to me just more fun.  When learning, don't let having to know the Chinese characters for the pieces scare you off.  After a short time learning the game you will get used to the characters and will have no problem telling what piece is what.

I played chess since I was 8 years old and didn't try XiangQi until I was 35. The Chinese characters may be intimidating at first, but once the board is set up it only takes about half an hour to memorize them. At first it was very frustrating that most of the pieces had such restricted movements compared to Chess. However, it is a very well balanced, fast moving game. I have taught the game to several chess playing friends.

I have only played once, getting my ass kicked, but it was fun. The fortress and river are are cool features that you don't get with western chess. It's no less abstract than western chess but those features help me to envision a battlefield. It would be easier for us noobs to learn if the pieces had pictures instead of Chinese characters, but there's some of the snob appeal that has everybody rushing off to get their copy of Xiangqi.

Better than western chess, in my opinion, for several reasons:
- king is restricted to a small area of the board
- king can actually contribute to an attack, with the line-of-sight rule
- no all-powerful queen
- knights cannot jump, and so can be blocked
- cannons allow for some really clever attacks

I'm not sure though if the reason I like xiang qi more isn't because it's new to me.  I liked western chess when I started as well, but now I'm in that uncomfortable position of too-good-for-newbies-but-good-players-can-clean-my-clock.  Perhaps after more games I will tire of this as well, but for right now, for an abstract, I quite like it.

This is another classic game. I find it slightly more complex than western Chess, since there are additional movement rules and restrictions, and the pieces I have are in a foreign language. I rate this game slightly lower than western chess only because it is not as popular, and thus, there are fewer opponents available.

RATING: 9
A fascinating Chess variant. An enormous amount of Chinese know how to play it, making Xiangqi the most played board game in the world. Particularly noteworthy is the cannon which moves like a rook but captures by jumping over a piece (whether your own or that of your opponent). The main drawback with the game is that it tends to be very drawish between equal players, the same sort of weakness that Western Chess struggles with. A considerable strength is that one does not need to rely too heavily on opening theory to play a good game. I prefer Shogi (Japanese Chess) over this game, but I prefer Xiangqi over Chess.

I bought a cheap paper set with wooden pieces (£4) at Village Games in Camden, London.

Only a few plays, but I think that I'd rather play this than European Chess.  Xiang Qi doesn't seem likely to draw as often as European Chess due to the limited king moves, and unlike Shogi it plays very quickly.  I think that Xiang Qi would be ideal for speed games, since it's tactics from the very beginning.  I wouldn't take this over Shogi, but Xiang Qi has merits all of its own.

Well, I suck at chess games in general, although I still like playing them.

You can use also the board and pieces to play a variant (called Banchi or An-qi) that uses only half the board and plays sort of like Stratego.  Just shuffle the pieces and place them on the squares upside down.  During a player&#039;s turn, they can either flip a piece or move one of their pieces one square.  The first player has to flip a piece, and the color of the piece is the color they play as.  Pieces can take other pieces if they are the same or greater rank, and the order is as follows.  General &gt; Guard &gt; Elephant &gt; Chariot &gt; Horse &gt; Cannon &gt; Pawn &gt; General.  The cannon is special, because it can only kill (and can kill anything) by jumping over one other piece, but it is also very vulnerable because of its low rank.  Game ends when you lose all your pieces (it may also end in a draw).

I find Chinese chess more interesting and challenging than Western chess, mainly because of the unique movement of the pieces and the more complex board (with its inclusion of the "river"). The "pao" add an interesting twist to the game, then you have pieces like the "xiang" that can't cross the river, the "shi" and the "Jiang" that are restricted to that small quadrant of the board and the "ma" whose "legs" can be blocked.

It feels like you start in the mid game of chess, the best part IMO, it plays faster, and unlike chess, you don't often encounter people with wildly different skill levels...unless you're in China :)  The cannon is such a wildly new way to think about moving it takes a bit of getting used to before you aren't leaving yourself open to simple attacks.  The only obstacle is recognizing the characters.  If you've studied any chinese it's not hard at all, but to someone who has no idea how a character is composed, I'd suggest a set with figures, not chinese characters.  On the other hand, some people find it fun trying to recognize them.

Not sure why I like this more than Western Chess. Maybe because I haven't had my ass handed to me time and time again with it. Maybe because there haven't been books and books written about the subject (in English anyway). Maybe because it feels simpler and by god it feels fresher to me. All personal things aside, I am happy to have played this finally. Memorizing the symbols wasn't as nearly as difficult as I thought it would be. The moves are straight-forward and make sense. I like the fortress aspect, cannon and the river. Overall, a great historical abstract that is a worthy predecessor to western chess.

More familiar under the name Xiang Qi (The Elephant Game), this first cousin to Western Chess is not only the board game played by more people on Earth than any other, but is one of the most enjoyable two-player games ever invented.

Whilst the Rook, Knight and Pawn have similar (with minor differences) moves to Western Chess, the King, Guard, Elephant and (especially) the Cannon are unique and, coupled with the restrictions of the "river" and "fortresses" on the board, make for a hugely enjoyable gaming experience, which is much more open and faster than conventional chess.  Sets are available for a few pounds from any decent oriental emporium (China Town in London is a good source) or hone your skills by playing online.

I guarantee you will not regret learning to play Xiang Qi!

I'm sure there is a lot of depth here, but I don't like having to read chinese characters to remember what each piece does. In that regard alone, chess is better. The version that I have also has pictures on one side, which does help this problem. Still, it is hard to convince anyone else to play, and almost no one knows how. Can't say I blame them for not wanting to learn an entire complex set of rules and new strategies. And again, as with Chess, the ability of players has to be very similar to make good gameplay possible.

Quick and bloody from the get-go.  The endgame usually involves desperate hand-to-hand in both palaces simultaneously, each player racing for the checkmate.  I find this game to be a nice break from (sometimes) head-hurty European chess.

On a side note:  "Westernized" pieces are for amateurs.  Use that big, pulsing brain of yours and learn the Chinese pieces.  It's not that hard.  If I can do it (my brain is not all that big and does not pulse) so can you.

I like the idea of Chess. I like the mental puzzle. I do NOT like playing people who have memorized opening moves and have studied Chess. In short, I am an amateur who enjoys the very occasional game of Chess.

For starters, XiangQi feels like Chess in that it is an abstract representation of archaic battles. Because it is less-known in the Western world, my opponents and I tend to start on a level playing ground.

The spice that XiangQi adds is that it feels more thematic than its Western counterpart. Pieces move in ways that make sense. For example, the cannon fires at pieces in the distance. The board itself has a river cutting the battlefield in half. The river has an impact not only on gameplay but certain pieces move differently once past the river. The king (emperor?) and his advisors stay within the castle (?). While the pieces and plastic playing mat of my XiangQi set are cheap, I feel as if I am seeing an archaic battlefield unfold on the table.

nice travel version. Board folds in half to store pieces.

Board is cherry stained wood with gold details

Wood folding board with gold lines/lettering.

Round bakelite cream pieces with chinese lettering on them store inside folding board.

There is a circle around each character and the colors are black and red

Magnetic closure.

Cherry colored stain on wood

Decent but not perfect condition board. small nciks that could likely be repaired with furniture touch up pen. Some tape residure.

Labeled Yuzhuan on the inside

For a chess player of my (avg/poor) level, this game is more fun. They come from the same root, but this feels a bit less abstract than chess (see catapults, guards). Additionally, unless you live in China, you're probably more likely to be on equal footing with your opponent, whereas with Chess, I always seem to be meeting random people who have memorized lots of openings.

In the mid 80's I attended U of H and worked at Memorial City Mall, which had a lot of Asians in the area at the time.  The economy stunk about as bad as it does now, so there weren't any good PT jobs for students.  I managed to get in on a grant program tutoring foreign students in English.  If you knew me, you'd find that funny because I have an "East Texas Hillbilly" drawl. 

These students were very poor and could barely afford shoes and food, much less entertainment.  They would be in the US for months or sometimes years at a time with only the occasional phone call or letter as contact from home.  Most of them stuck together in little cliques based on where they were from.  They  played games from home or read books for class and had deep discussions trying to translate and understand.  I was exposed to a lot of gaming from Asia and Eastern Europe.  Usually one guy had a wooden board he made himself and another had some game pieces that he'd had since he was a child that his Uncle carved for him and someone else had dice or whatnot. (The Indian dice were something it took me a while to get used to, I could deal with the figurines and stones but those crazy dice were something else.)  I still am a bit phobic about game pieces in languages I cannot read, so I put stickers with their names in English on them. 

They didn't warm up to me at first because I was a female but the University said they had to participate because their grades stank since they didn't understand the instruction well enough. I played games with them to blend in.  Most were abstract type games but a few played chess.  I had to throw a few games (many were from some very male-egocentric countries and they didn't believe women were smart enough to beat a man at games). It was quite an experience for all of us for the two years I did the program, but hey I had a lot of fun and learned a lot of new games most Americans have never even heard of!

At one time I had a wooden board and some play pieces that I had marked up with stickers in English (yes, everything had an English lesson with it, even gaming), but it was given away when I moved.

14th December 2012 - Rating 8 - Just scratching the surface.  A process of trial and error but it all feels quite exotic at this stage (I should get out more).  Enjoying the river, range of pieces and the 'Look of Death'.  Xiangqi appears to be a mixture of chess and middle earth.

2nd August 2013 - Rating 9 - Too long between games but consistency is comforting.  It appears that not only am I terrible at Western style chess but I am equally terrible at Chinese Chess.  It is reassuruing that wherever I am in the world I will suck at chess.

However, the widening of boundaries and the mixing of the familiar and the new is also exciting.  The river, the palace, the elephants, cannon, chariots and advisors all bring new challenges and require new approaches.  I am a long way from working out strategies but I have enjoyed every moment.  At present Xiangqi is surpassing Western Style Chess.

Xiang qi is a great game for a lot of reasons. It's unfamiliar to most people in the West, so most people are on an even playing field (unlike int'l chess). It's got more theme than int'l chess -- the castle is like a castle, for instance. And it's the best way I've found to meet locals when travelling in Asia. So many people play xq in Asia, and they will get a kick out of seeing you play if you're not Asian.

I'd say about 60% of XiangQi is instantly familiar to players of western chess, which makes teaching it much easier. Yet it has its own unique flavor. Burnt out on western chess after thousands and thousands of games since age eight, In March 2002 I moved to Chinese Chess and I've never looked back. It'll be a very long time before I burn out on XiangQi. Its no more complicated (as long as one uses pieces with icons) than western chess and the board even has terrain (the palaces and the river).    
- I made my own cardboard set 03/25/02, downloaded from the interwebs, and taught myself how to play. I use pieces with icons. I have no intention of trying to figure out the Chinese characters most serious players use. 
- 03/22/10 I purchased a $6 "store bought" set, yet I find myself utilizing my home made one more often, as its easier for new/infrequent players. It has the possible moves for the elephants marked, the river and palaces are colored, and the set up locations are marked. 11/07/15 I finally used my "store bought" set. 
- As of 10/28/17 I've played XiangQi 31 times, winning 24 (77.4%).

One of my colleagues claims this is a much deeper game than Western chess, and that the Chinese invented chess. Xiangqi is certainly chess's equal, but I can't agree with those claims.  It strikes me that Xiangqi should be more draw-ish than Western chess, at least for equally matched players.  There is limited promotion and more restricted movement, notwithstanding the fact that the king or general is more vulnerable.  Xiangqi is an outlier when compared to other regions' chess.  It is the only one played on the points rather than the squares, the only one with topography (fortress, river) and the only one with a cannon piece (which is pretty cool.)   It's hard to see how the "original" game would be so different from the others that stretch half-way round the globe.

Similar to Western chess, with some differences: 1)the cannon  jumps over pieces to capture, 2) the knight can be blocked, 3) the guards and the king are confined to a small grid, 4) pawns may move sideways when they cross the river. I do prefer Western chess - I suspect there are more possiblities, whereas I suspect in Chinese chess there are only a few standard openings. Many of my games were when I was a small boy and I got crushed playing adults, however.

Chinese Chess - it was alright, but it was hard for me to follow since the characters look so similar/complicated. After learning some Chinese and Japanese, it'd be better, but I still liked normal chess more - this was fine but still kind of meh to me.

It's like chess but more explosive and faster. A reversal of pressure can be flipped much quicker, and while chess can be played where you make trades for having more pieces than your opponent, it's a lot more about its very specific placement and control and how to secure your checkmate without leaving yourself too exposed.

I learned this before International Chess, and am much better at this, because it doesn't really involve diagonal movement. Like this more than International Chess too, because the board is more open, with room for sweeping counterattacks. Hence, I'd much rather watch a game of this between experts than International Chess - the latter is soporific.

I learned this when I was 6 years old, and this is the only one that has survived my propensity to get tired of games. I think that more than proves that I will always want to play this. However, I am more interested in trying newfangled board games right now.

Shaded the design down just a tad since it takes a while to develop pieces and get into the exciting mid-game.

Well, this game is a must TRY for every chess player. It comes with a bit of a learning curve because trying to remember the pieces poses half of the challenge. Then once you get past that, you must remember how the cannon attacks. Finally, once you can identify ALL the pieces on the board, and you keep in mind which pieces the cannons on each side are attacking/defending, you must come up with a good move to make. Here's the point where the rest of your experience begins.

This game feels faster and more cutthroat than western chess. If you have a pleasant partner to play with, this is an excellent game and I highly recommend it. It's hard to find people who know how to play the game though, so you might have to make your own.

I bumped this up to 9. On repeated plays it's just as fun for me as Western Chess.

RATING: 9.5
Supposedly, more than a billion people play this game.  If so, Puerto Rico, eat your heart out! If international chess is a stately dance of death, then xiangqi is a barroom brawl.  Xiangqi seems to be almost completely, and wonderfully, tactical.  If there is any long-term strategy, it escapes me, although certain short-term strategic principles, like seizing ranks and files with rooks, obviously apply.  On the other hand, I'm just a beginner, so you shouldn't take my word for it.  Also note that the game tends to be somewhat drawish.  As far as I can tell, about one-third of professional-level games end in a draw.  For me, however, draws do not detract from the game at all.  Because perpetual check and perpetual chasing (especially in the endgame) are sometimes difficult to adjudicate, I recommend the detailed rules available at the World Xiangqi Federation website:  www.wxf.org.  I don't really agree that this is a faster game than chess.  It is subject to quite lengthy endgames. However, the endgames are very engaging !  Fun thing I've done: played kibitzer to the lively xiangqi games in Portsmouth Square in San Francisco.  Fun thing I want to do:  play a game of xiangqi by squatting on the ground over a paper board like they do in China.

Another form of chess. It breaks all the "chess vision" that I assume I have when I play it and I don't know any standard openings. That makes it interesting for the occasional play to get my brain thinking in different directions but not a game that I'm dieing to get to the table.

More approachable than Western Chess, at least outside of China, where people do tend to be of medium skill level at best. 
Playing against people who are of very different skill level brings the same problems as in Chess. But it is easier to find people of low to medium skill level to play against.
Also the game is not quite as dependent on opening analysis (Or rather: the analysis is less complex.) The game "explodes" quicker, as opening moves are more numerous.

Currently my favorite Chess variation. I'm not normally a fan of Chess -- not because it's a bad game, but instead because I don't normally go in for special power abstracts with loads of look-ahead. Xiangqi is different in that the game plays very quickly, favoring tactics over long-term strategy at the introductory levels of play. The piece powers also feel very direct and, in the case of the cannon, exciting! Most of all, games are short. You can play a few and never feel like you are stuck slogging through a losing situation. If you run into trouble, your opponent will quickly dispatch your pathetic excuse for a fighting force, and then you can reset and try again. Of course with more experience comes a longer play-time, but by then you won't mind because the more enjoyable subtitles of play with make themselves known.

If you're not a fan of Chess, or if you're simply new to the game and its many world-spanning variants, Xiangqi might be for you. I only wish that pieces with Western iconography were more common as learning the Chinese characters, while educational, are certainly a bit of a stumbling block for new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I prefer this to standard chess for a couple of reasons.  First, the board is more open, due to its larger size (90 spaces compared to 64), fewer pawns (5 per side vs 8), and the dynamic leaping ability of the cannons.  Second, the generals are easier to trap since they are confined to the castle and the death stare rule, which states that the generals can never have an open line of sight to each other.  These changes make XiangQi the more dynamic and fun game to me.

It is not as sophisticated a game as Chess.  As far as I can see it does not present the same challengers.  However, I find it a quirky and interesting game to play and would play it in favour of chess.
First there is the challenge of remembering and tracking the pieces which can only be differentiated by the Chinese symbol.  (I started off sticking names to the pices, but my Vietnamese wife banned that so I had to learn the characters.)  Then there are the quirky moves.  The artillery which can only take after hopping over another piece, so its options change as other pieces are moved.  Or the horse which moves like a western Knight but must touch an interving square, such that the reverse move is not always possible.

XiangQi is one of the most played board games in the world.XiangQi is also known as "Chinese Chess" and is played with 32 pieces (16 per player) on a 9x10 gameboard. As in the game of Go, the game is played on the intersections of the gameboard. The area of play is divided into two territories by a "river" in the middle of gameboard. In each territory there is a 3x3 "palace", in which each player's respective General/Marshal is located. The object of the game is to "checkmate" the other player's General/Marshal. The other pieces in the game include Chariots, Horses, Elephants, Advisors, Cannons, and Soldiers.

Really enjoying this so far.  I am surprised how little my (meager) chess knowledge carries over.  The game is very different, with dedicated offensive and defensive pieces, and nearly worthless pawns (compared to extremely useful pawns in Western chess).

Classic strategy game, more thematic to its sister game Chess and seems to be less dependent on memorization.

Have a nice wooden board, and played this a few times back in the day. Can't for the life of me remember how it is played now, and not sure I would choose to play this over something else (Battleline would be my preferred two player choice).

Like the related game chess, this game is as close to being the ideal game as one can get.

This have the depth and infinite replayability of chess to which it is related. This too is pure strategy at its finest. Yet however similar in some ways, in others the board and pieces are different than Western chess.

"Chinese Chess".  It feels a lot like traditional chess with some different pieces and movement rules.  Most versions of the game have chinese characters on wooden pieces, but mine has plastic pieces with characters on one side and animal/people figures on the other.  I like the extra thinking to use the long-jump captures of cannons and the openness of the board with fewer pawns.  The downside, similar to chess, is that players need to be closely matched in skill or games are really one-sided.  Also, for players who are very skilled, the final check-mate is tricky to get and games can get stuck in repeating loops, draws, or stalemates.  Still, its a very neat game, and one worth learning.

Much upside potential.  It currently suffers from the fact that we're also learning both [I]Chess[/I] and [I]Shogi[/I] in the family; there's only so much room for chess variants.

A 2-players abstract game which is found common for Chinese to have fun in the streets. It can take you a long-period of time to master its basic rules and to make the chess pieces move in the correct-steps. Best recommend for brain-twister players and for the oldies.

Almost as good as chess. Different. I wouldn't be surprised to find some value it higher than the traditional chess; for me it's very slightly inferior. Still, a great abstract game with multitudes of new possibilities.

Caution: do not go near the Korean version or your brain will boil. You have been warned.

All middle game!  Delicious!

I really dig the arcane---Don't let those Generals look at each other, and the Elephants' feet musn't get wet!

I'll bet that most people rating Western chess higher just haven't played this.

Good game, but I prefer Shogi and Chess (and I'm much better at those games, which may explain my bias).  It does however, contain the most fun/wild piece to play in all chess games - THE CANNON.  Followed closely by the elephant...;-)

Admittedly I'm not very good at this, and I don't play it too often, but I have to say I enjoy it a lot more than its western counterpart (i.e. chess).  Another central pillar in the Chinese gaming culture, it was a great way to spend time with my father when we had limited options in terms of boardgaming.

Got a copy in China.  Not that great.  Maybe it was the fact that the kid I was playing was explaining the rules in Chinese and I couldn't understand him.

The fact that many of the pieces are restricted to their side of the river, or even to their palace, makes this a very interesting chess to play.  Additionally, the cannon's jump-precisely-one-piece-to-capture attack presents interesting tactics both for attack and for defense.  Did I mention that both players start the game with pieces threatened?  Even to a beginner, the first move can't seem unimportant.  :^)

We asked my sister living in China to bring us a copy of Mah Johng.  Instead, we got this...  It will still serve it's purpose of a decoration although I want to make a board for it since the one we have is vinyl.

As good as Western chess, for sure, if not better.  If only I could figure out how to use and anticipate the canon . . .

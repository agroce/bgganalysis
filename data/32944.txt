"Anything is up for auction." An interesting game of (sometimes shared) self-interest. Working toward completing a row (or not), valuing other player's pieces, and changing the landscape and stakes with building contracts & the mayor's attention all create some interesting decisions about how people will act. In particular, I find the single bid and ability to place someone else's pieces to be a wonderful aspect of the game. In normal auction games, there is a gamesmanship involved in how high one can jack up the bid, but with this being a closed economy, the decision is much more between "what do I think the auctioneer values this at, what do I value it at, do I want it, or want to get paid for it?" Interesting decision path, and one that is best played as a gut check of sorts. 

The game is likely equal parts strategy and tactics at the mid player counts (and I think it shines at 4; enough chaos to keep it interesting, but not enough to make folks hunker down). At two player, the auction becomes more about ensuring you have a steady cash base to work from as losing all of your money allows your opponent time to run wild. Very playable at both extremes, the game ultimately feels different (and has different strategies and modes of play) at each player count with our favorite being at 4 (with 3 and 5 coming in second and third place). Not recommended for groups that wish to avoid conflict or are likely to take it personally when bad things (inevitably) happen to them and players who want to math everything out in this game will suffer and don't seem to enjoy it (because blocks get covered, money is hidden, etc).

update: 25+ plays later, it's possible to form a cohesive strategy at the beginning of the game and run with it, but doing so largely fits into a 6 slot matrix of options while the rest of the game is tactical play. The reward of the analysis during tactical play is that not many moves matter, but you won't necessarily know which ones until game after game after game. Still an 8.

Interesting economic game where you are a Real estate developer and are trying to build buildings or take over buildings from other players. Another strategy is just to mess with all other players and try to be the one with the least negative points.

The ebb of and flow of the NH is not really to my tastes. I don't think I've played another game with quite as much regular and expected screwage as NH. The game is super quirky and I want to like it because of that. But for some reason I can't fully put my finger on the auctions just always leave a bad taste in my mouth. The game is otherwise fine and others like it a lot.

Neue Heimat presents you with a new housing development in which everything is for sale: the floors of the buildings, the roofs, permits to extend (or shrink) the site, even the favour of Mr Mayor.  

Neue Heimat is a series of once round auctions in which the players take turns to be auctioneer.  The auctioneer can choose to pay the highest bidder what he bid or take the money.  The game has a closed economy; no money ever goes to the bank. The floors are represented by cubes in six colours.  Players take ownership of a colour when they are the first to buy a cube of that colour.  Your aim is to have your cubes on the top floor of as many completed (with a roof) buildings as possible in completed rows of houses.

What ensues is a highly variable game - my three plays have all been very different - with many decisions and subtle judgments.  Oh, and plentiful opportunities to screw thy neighbour.  Quite the nastiest auction game I've played in a while, Neue Heimat is really pretty fine.

Component quality is excellent, though I'm not so fond of the box from a stationery warehouse.

This game has a reputation for being an auction game with tremendous amounts of screwage available to players, and its reputation is deserving. With simple rules that create complex, yet tractable, game states, Neue Heimat was fun.  Then again, I am particularly fond of good auction games.  

True, this is essentially an abstract with auctions essentially lacking in theme, but the level of interaction, the interesting choices, and the amusement of the many auctions makes up for the lack of theme.  It seems to me that this game particularly lends itself to variants or house rules that improve the game pursuant to the preferences of particular gamer groups.  I might consider certain house rules that shorten the game such that it becomes an intense 30 minute filler for serious gamer types.  Bottom line:  this game deserves a reprint and should be higher rated on BGG.

i just love it - it works fine with only 2 players as well although - like with most games - the real thing starts with 3 players or more. some aspects are random e.g. which floor dices are drawn or whether you draw a roof that suits your plans or not. But nevertheless everything is visible to everybody and it is up to you to make the right decision in every moment of the game. Never a second of waiting until someone finishes his or her move. You may fail in the first round but you may learn a lot by doing so. That is one of the reasons why it is strongly recommended to play several rounds. Beware: Really addictive! 
Update: Having read the comments of Ryan Gatti I tried several rounds according to the suggestions concerning the roofs and i must admit that these variants (scoring success but zero points) can add some new aspects to the game. Worth while a try!

The empty rooftops were ditched for our games, and I think that makes sense.  The owner of the game said the designer himself considered it a mistake.  Anyway, lovably brutal auction game: "your" stuff can be used against you, "others" stuff can be used against them.  Closed economy is cool.  Potential for painful player shutouts if they don't get a color.  Sorta like not getting a country in Imperial and NEVER being able to, although they too can still win.  Perfectly open info can run into calculation + endgame prediction branches (AP), seems like both unintended and unavoidable kingmaker issues could both be very present.  Still like it and would play again, hoping for a shorter game length to make issues less of an issue.

Don't let the dated Fischer-Price toy facade fool you. This is a wonderful auction game that is tense, low-luck, and quite mean. 

Like many auction games, the mechanics of the game are quite simple. In the game, players are building homes (dice blocks) along 3 rows. At the end of the game, these dice-blocks score points to whoever "owns" the building, which is the player with the top dice-block. Thus, players can steal ownership of homes from each other. But there is a catch... you score negative points if the row isn't completed, which can be quite difficult as it requires EVERY spot in the row to be filled with a house and EVERY house to have a roof on top of it. Furthermore, players can modify the number of spots in a row and even double the points that the row scores (negative or positive). Thus, many times you don't want to own a house and other players will give you ownership to make you score negative. 

Because of the end-game scoring, several wonderful elements develop. (1) First, there is this synergistic relationship between players, as players attempt to position themselves where others can't attack/hurt them without hurting themselves. (2) Secondly, because players can build-over other blocks, extend/reduce rows, etc... the vast majority of auctions can't be ignored. Nearly everything is a double-edged sword and it's not uncommon to have similar interest with a player one turn and opposing interest the next turn.

It should also be highlighted that the game is quite "sandboxy." Where most auction games are fairly straight forward (elevated color x, collect sets of y, etc), there are multiple viable strategies in this game. Most notably, the player who wins the first dice of a particular color gains ownership of that color. Thus, it is perfectly common for someone to own multiple colors or no colors at all. How can you win if you own no colors? You make everyone else score negative. 

My only strong criticism of the game comes with the base-rules, which mandate that the auctioneer loses their turn if they draw a 0-value roof. Since auctioning is the most straight forward way to earn money, loosing a turn can be especially hurtful. Most reviewers/commenters of the game play with the official variant, which eliminates that high-luck element and turns the game into one of low-luck. And with that variant, the game is refreshing, unique, and downright fun to play. Because of its simplicity, it works well with casual gamers. But because of the low-luck/sandboxy nature, it also manages to be a game that competitive gamers can burn their brains on.

Initial play.  I took three coloured cubes.  Probably a bad move, but also because one player had no colour.  I think this is unlikely ever to be a winning tactic and it also sadly turned what could have been a very promising game into a negative experience.  Maybe a house rule is required to require all players to take a colour, even if the last is at no cost.  Would like to play again with all players engaged.

Nueue Heimat has no hidden information (if you play with a house rule.)  However, the 4-player game felt very chaotic and swingy.  Initial board positioning and color selection was a crap shoot.  Overall, it felt like a Knizia math exercise, further developed by Winsome.

Very swingy. Houses can be worth very much or very little with the results of a single auction. Seems prone to a kingmaking situation quite often in the 3-player game. Best house rules for the blank roofs is inconclusive.

That said, there is a lot to interest me in this game. Closed economy, money isn't VPs, collusive player relationships, investment. If good play alleviates some of the above issues, this could be an 8 or 10.

It's risk to call a company "chili games". May be the people say "silly games".

Juego cortito, en el que se contruyen edificios. Cada edificio está compuesto de dados de colores, que se distribuyen al azar en una matriz al inicio del juego. Al principio, nadie tiene asignado un color. La asignación se lleva a cabo cuando se escoge un dado por primera vez. Después de eso, para construir un segundo piso hay que utilizar un dado de mayor valor. Además, se puede añadir un tejado (escogido al azar) que cierra el edificio y otorga puntos extra. También hay unos permisos que permiten alargar o acortar la duración del juego. Se juega a ganar varias rondas y cada ronda termina en cuanto dos filas de edificios quedan completadas. Es sencillo de jugar y tiene un puntito de puteo muy agradable, aunque el azar tiene algo de peso.

Our first game was a little weird and felt out of whack because no one knew what they were doing. Everyone overbid at the start, and I probably made a blunder taking 3 colors. Still, I quite like the idea of this game and would like to try it again soon before we forget it.

Tentatively a 7 rating because it seems to have promise.

Holy cutthroat bidding game!  This one is pretty brutal, but in a good way!  Lots of possible screwage in this one, and the game I played so far took this to the extreme with all three rows of houses scoring negative points.  Even when you think you have some nice points going, suddenly the length of that row can be increased with a special permit, or the roofs get used up before that row gets completed and you end up sitting on negative points!  Pretty much every auction is important, and the results were uncertain right up to the end.  Great game!

[thing=32944][/thing] is the auction game that [thing=12][/thing] should have been.  (Yes, I know: [thread=52083]”Ra is NOT an auction game.”[/thread])  Both games situate player-driven auctions within a closed economy, where players expend a currency that doesn’t directly correlate to points and, by winning, benefit other players in the process.  The two fundamental differences between the games are the nature of the auction-generating decisions and the method of structuring asymmetrical player incentives.  

In Neue Heimat (German for “New Homes”), players take turns auctioning off a single item from an available pool of construction materials that are then employed to build homes within an allotted space.  The items include floors (i.e., stories), roofs, and various building permits.  Each other player may make a single bid, and the auctioning player then chooses whether to accept the highest bid, receiving payment from that player in exchange for the auctioned item, or to keep the item and pay the highest bidder the amount of his/her bid.  The winner of the auction immediately uses the item won by adding it to the construction on the board (or, in certain cases, discards it).  Each floor has a value and a color.  The player who first places a floor of a color scores points for that color for the round.  Floors may be added to any unfinished building (i.e., buildings without a roof), so long as the floor below the one to be placed has a larger value.  The total value of a building’s floors and roof are scored for the player who owns the color of the top story.  The round ends when two of three rows of buildings are finished.  The unfinished row of buildings scores negative points.  (There’s more to it, but that’s enough for the purposes of this list). 

In Ra, players initiate an auction by invoking “Ra” when they think that the available randomly-populated lot provides the incentives they desire.  The decision is about timing and risk-management.  You choose when to call an auction by balancing what’s available against what might be available later.  Neue Heimat eliminates the risk-management by making all information public, and replaces the timing with free choice.  Players still (largely) choose from randomly-populated lots (only six of the twenty-four floor cubes are available for auction at a time), and still must decide what auction item will have the effect on others that the auctioneer desires, but the consequences and opportunity costs of that decisions are open and calculable.  Neue Heimat thus generates a similar type of auction atmosphere with a mechanic that is significantly more palatable to gamers who like control and who play to win.  It’s akin the difference between [thing=74][/thing] and [thing=39856][/thing] – similar systems, meaningfully different results.  

More important, however, is what happens after the auctions.  Rather than layering a simple trick-taking or set-collecting mechanic with an indecipherable scoring system so as to provide diverging player goals as the game progresses, Neue Heimat’s building construction game allows the other players to manipulate your incentive structure (and your score) in surprisingly intuitive ways.  Players can out-and-out steal points from one another, can place pieces to force symbiotic alliances from turn-to-turn or round-to-round, and can manipulate the length of each round and the comparative values of rows.  It’s a brutally interactive system, which, in turn, makes the auctions much more interesting and less introspective.  

There’s a lot more that can be said about this game, but I’ll need many more plays and a better forum to really explore and explain the depth involved.  It’s a great game, with the potential for a lot more lurking (read: upward rating mobility), and it fills a gaming void I never knew I had.  I’m glad I took the plunge with this one.

An abstract building game where building materials are auctioned off between players in a closed economy, and players must figure out how to both work together for mutual benefit and screw each other over as efficiently as possible. The game is very chaotic and barely controllable, and very difficult to play well. Huge negative scores are very possible. But good play is rewarded. Rewards much different skills than most euro games. A great game to frustrate the min-max type players.

This is a game ostensibly about building houses, but the theme is pretty much pasted on. This is an abstract bidding game involving the stacking of blocks.

There's a lot of good auction/bidding games that I've played already, so this type of game has some tough competition. I didn't find the lots/items to bid on all that compelling. I can think of 4 or 5 other auction games I'd rather be playing.

(1-7-11)This game just keeps getting better. It is a much more defensive game than i even thought at first. Don't spend to much on anything, don't buy your own stuff, don't think anything is critical, keep at it, don't give up. Making the alliances work for you is fundamental but not easy.

(original)First play was pretty staggering. There are so many ways for other players to hurt you, it seems like any move opens you up to any number of counter-punches. That said, I think there is a lot a like in the game, and it may turn out not to be quite as tactical as it did on first blush. The distribution of cubes and the order in which they come out as well as the alliances that most certainly can be built might will likely make this game a very interesting one indeed. I think I'll have to get it.

Rating based on 3 plays. 

Wow. Fantastic. I was tempted to give it a 9, but decided to get some more plays in before I go to that level. Played with the variant of using 2 "0" roofs. Play it that way, and the game is phenomenal. Vastly superior to the written rule. 

The closed economy auctions and unapologetic "screw you" factor make this game a 30-45 minute treat. I'm really stunned at how deep this game is for the play time. Virtually every auction really counts. Very swingy as well, but I consider that a positive. Player elimination is implied, if not actual. (Yes you can be WAY out of the running, but the game is short, so who cares, and it won't happen until late game).

Mean mean mean auction game.  Despite rumors you may have heard, it is one of those rare auction games that work well with two.  The way auctions are paid out to keep a closed economy create some fascinating situations.

My preferred house-rule has roofs chosen the same way as building cubes and 0 roofs negating all pips in the house.

There are agonizing decisions as to how to set yourself up in the future, or burn your opponent in the present.  There are also strong timing elements to make sure you have cash on hand.  Find yourself low on cash for a turn, and your opponents may auction that piece you have been waiting for just to spite you.

Update:... and man mulitplayer games of this are just brutal.  There is a see-saw back and forth and temporary alliances can suddenly bring someone back from the dead (or place someone in the lead in a huge hole).  I'm still trying to figure out how to play well enough to win, but not well enough that everybody knows I'm winning.

Those that hate bash the leader may want to stay away.

Wow, this is a fantastic and cut-throat game. Its simply a series of auctions, but the manipulations are so convoluted that its very nice. There is a variant to remove all luck (with the zero value roofs), which may be preferred for some people.

The game will not work unless you agree to play a series of rounds (something like 5 would be best) since its possible to generate income but not points or points but lose income. The penalty for generating points needs to be balanced in later rounds, else you end up with a game where large opportunities may come at a time when only one or two players could benefit, and feel a bit chaotic.

I wish this one was more widely available. I'm looking forward to playing again, and would love to get a copy of the game for myself.

RATING: 6
Neue Heimat is a pure auction game that emphasizes player screwage to a degree that many Euro fans will find surprising.

In short, there are 6 colours of cubes, and 6 cubes in each of those colours. Each cube has a number between 1 and 6 inclusive. Prior to the game, a subset of those cubes is randomly chosen and then placed out in three rows. Additionally, a number of roof pieces are put out that have numbers on their tops which are concealed.

Each turn the active player selects a cube from the end of one of the three lines, a roof piece, or one of a few minor special bits that aren't worth going into for this blurb. A once-around auction occurs with the first bidder setting the base price, and subsequent bidders only being able to increment it by 1. The auctioneer can accept the bid and take the money, or pay the highest bidder exactly what they bid to keep the item. The economy is completely closed, so one has to keep track of where the money is flowing to keep one or two players from having too much power.

The scoring system is where the game is interesting. Players become invested given colours by being the first to place a block of that colour onto the board. Those blocks can be stacked atop one another, but lower value cubes must be placed on top of higher value ones. Ex: you can only place a 1 or a 2 on top of a 3 block, and so forth. A building is finished when a roof piece is placed onto it, and the player who controls the colour cube that is on top of the building scores the entire thing. The trick is that at the end of the game, there is going to be at least one row which will score negative points for being incomplete (i.e.: the entire row isn't both full and topped off with roof pieces) and there can be more. So having a high scoring tower can be a blessing or a curse depending on the situation.

Weird things: the game is really, really swingy; I would venture to say, close to out of control quite a lot of the time. It can be extremely difficult to protect your assets and towers can change control pretty easily in many cases. Moreover, the roof pieces can also be ridiculous if you use the base rules that include a number of blank value pieces in the random pool. If you pull one of these when you call for an auction, you just lose your turn, which is incredibly harsh, as low value roof pieces already hurt you enough. You can, thankfully, just take out the blanks, and that is the way I prefer to play it.

The game does have a lot of positives. I like tricky auction decisions, I like having to gauge how and when to make a thrust onto the board, &c. However, I'm still not convinced that players can maintain a lot of meaningful control because the towers can change hands so frequently and easily. Still, an interesting game and one I would like to explore further.

I'm partial to auction and bidding games for their high level of interaction. This games echoes the best aspects of my favorites, especially Traders of Genoa, with hints of Santiago. 

The number of choices at each turn is usually huge, so you have lots of opportunity for subtle, clever play. I really like the ad hoc allegiances that come and go due to common goals on streets, and how you have to consider these when you bid for and place blocks.  Timing the auction of the Mayor and Permits has been a huge factor in every game, adding a great "playing chicken" aspect. The roof draw mechanism gives the game just a pinch of delicious uncertainty.

This is a tactically deep game that requires consideration of human nature and application of "social" skills...very like Traders. I've been challenged, amazed, and entertained every time I've played.

Vicious, nasty game. Lots of opportunity for player screwage, but unlike some games (ahem, Vanuatu) screwage here just means loss of points; the players always have something to do on their turn. And it's short enough that losing badly isn't that frustrating. Very abstract, and I'm not sure why it's subtitled as such, because I don't see the connection with poker. Bidding, mostly.

I first played this one tonight, so my opinions are still cementing themselves, but overall I was pretty impressed. The game takes the play time and relatively simple structure of all the other semi-abstract 45 minute auction games out there and combines them with a level of viciousness that you are unlikely to find in Ra. During scoring only a maximum of two of the potential three rows will score, creating interesting alliances between the players, that frequently shift as the game state and potential ending conditions change. I can easily see this one becoming a staple, and look forward to playing it again in the near future.

Interestingly enough, I suspect this is one auction game that will work fine with two. One of the two games I played tonight was with two players, and while it did not have the interesting incentive structures of the three player game, it was just as cuthroat and almost as entertaining. I doubt I would ever choose to play this one with two when three or four players are available, but it is certainly not a bad choice.

You bid on markers to take control of buildings and hope to finish off a row so that it scores. However, your opponents will try to prevent that such that you get negative points -- unless they have a building(s) in that row too and then want to work with you. But just because somebody is your buddy for the moment doesn't mean they won't leave you for a better deal.

I'm generally not very interested in games where the auction is the game as it is here, so I won't pursue a copy, but I'd play again. Very effective at what it sets out to do, and I highly recommend for pure auction aficionados.

A closed economy auction game, something I'm rubbish at but doable. The game seems very contained, and the limited options turn into close choices (sign of a good German game!). Interesting, quick and easy once you get it, I'll be trying this on other players.

This game is absolutely brutal.  Usually when first bidding on a color, you're looking at the cube setup trying to figure out just how badly someone could extort you with that particular color down the road.  

It almost seems as multi-layered or varied as I would like, but not quite.  I would describe shrewdness as being the most desired quality for players in this game which isn't my favorite mode for my mind to be in.  Everything is always changing and those that can most accurately assess the situation will likely fair the best.  That's just my tastes and a very subjective thing, though, and it's quite possible my mind just hasn't properly clicked with the game yet.  

The game is heaping with tension and interesting player alliances.  I appreciate the two ends of the spectrum between scoring points and building up money.  The rule where two wins out of three rounds automatically wins regardless of score is what really makes everything shine.

RATING: 7
Neue Heimat is a defensive auction game. It is much easier to get shafted than to actually grow your score so in most cases the question isn't about whether winning the bid would help you the most but whether you can afford not winning the bid.

It is a very tactical and short-term approach to auctioning. The bad part is that it is extremely volatile. A single bid won or lost can make a tremendous difference to your score either way, and you cannot control everything. The game as is is rather prone to king-making situations. The good part, however, is that there is quite a bit of room for building (even involuntary) alliances, incentivizing other players to do your work for you and spend their cash for your benefit. Control is fairly indirect but that probably makes it all the more fascinating.

Neue Heimat is the nastiest of nasty games. While I've never actually played it on a busy school-night, the time to play definitely falls into this range. It's a popular game with my game group and it's surprising that we still remain friends.

German for "gut wrenching". Frighteningly fuzzy auction game with shared incentives, uneasy cooperation, and outright extortion. Two games in, and I still have no idea how to approach this thing, must less have a grasp at valuation. 

Three games in, and I consider merely finishing in the black to be a victory. How can something so adorable be so evil?

Update: Could this be the best pure auction game ever?

Need to play again before I can really comment. I really disliked this game after first play, but I couldn't stop thinking about it. The main problem I see is that in a 4+ game it can be extremely difficult to implement an strategy whereby you can set yourself up to auction off a valuable item by the time your turn comes around.

Played again, it was better the second time. Actually quite fun.

After a third play this game continues to improve.

Ok this game is freaking awesome. It gets a 9. Brilliant.

still improving with more plays. Best non-wargame conflict game.

The game is heavily based on auctions and the rules are simple, but there are *many* things to consider during play - which colors to support, what pieces to auction and when, how much to pay, when to extend a building zone, the mayor, e.t.c.

RATING: 5
Extremely bizarre auction game.  Very swing-y, and there may not be enough opportunity to make progress in the face of an unstable endgame.  Or there may be.  I would need to play it more in order to know, which may or may not happen.  Thanks for reading my definitive and forceful comments on this game.

My first game ended in a blatant kingmaker situation.  On the final turn, I was unable to win, but in placing the final piece I could award victory to any one of the other three players!  That example illustrates how unstable the game is.  Huge assets can turn into huge debits with one small move, and there might not be anything you can do about it.  In the same game, I lost three turns to blank roof pieces.  What's up with that rule?

This is a very interesting game, although the question of whether it is a [i]good[/i] game is unsettled.  I suspect that efforts to obtain this information will end in frustration, and a feeling of falling "just short."

It has some really interesting ideas, I like auctions, and the presentation is nice. But it just doesn't feel right. I've played twice now and I'm still not sure we had the rules right either time. There's an extreme amount of hoseage, and it often makes sense to bid on an auction just to screw over others. For instance you can buy up a block to cover up someone else's, giving ownership of the building to a third party. Another option can reverse the values of every building in a row from positive to negative or vice versa. This leads to some wild swings in fortune that are interesting in theory but in practice are just not that much fun. The blank roof tiles that can randomly hose you out of your turn are pretty awful. Overall the game just seems half-baked to me. I'd play again but don't hold out much hope of it rising beyond a 6 rating. There are too many better auction games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Short playing game, but it is very scaleable.  As written (with "0" roofs) it has a luck element that can keep it in the family game category.  The "illegal earnings" and extension pieces can have very subtle playability.  It's variable setup gives constant new chalenges to the play.

(07/05/2014) Comment based on 1 play.

This is an interesting building/race game, with comfortable tactile feel of wooden pieces. Feels more like you're playing a toy, but it masks the fact that there is a sophisticated and brutal auction/area control game buried in there.

I couldn't wrap my head around it, made some stupid early play, which pretty much dictated the rest of the game for me. Although it is a quick playing game, and there are some colorful wooden pieces, there are somewhat random elements,  with possibly a runaway leader effect. The game is somewhat fragile, like Chicago Express, where one small mistake will punish a player. Traditional assessment of value will not work here, and there is plenty of screwage abound. Thank goodness it was short; I care not to invest any more time in trying to figure it out. Initial rating a "6", and most likely will never play this again.

OMG. What a brain burning :sauron::devil::sauron::devil::sauron::devil::sauron: of a game for two players! Never again with open pips. We only opened them up near the end of a learning game, but that glimpse into absolute AP hell shall never be repeated again! Argh.

For two, we also will not use the "blanks as zero values" variant again, either. Much prefer the risk and tactical upset of a turn order shift. Makes for some interesting risk assessment. Others will disagree.

Definitely standard rules for two, until we have at least a dozen plays logged. At least. Omg. We are dying.

I am not to thrilled with the fact that if one player doesn't collect a color he basically has no way of winning.  Is a rather interesting game though.  Maybe I will need to play it again.  (BTW I was the player without a designated color)

Don't be deceived by the seemingly juvenile aesthetics of this game (it looks like something you might have played with in preschool)--there is more here than meets the eye.

RATING: 8
Neue Heimat is a cut-throat auction game made almost entirely of wood. "This looks very German," was one comment. On a turn, a player picks up one of the pieces and auctions it to the others. He either accepts the highest bid and takes the money, or he pays the highest bidder and takes the piece himself. It's a closed-money game, so you can only get additional money by accepting others' bids and if you over-pay you can be hamstrung until you sell something of value to the others. Players are developers building on three rows of building plots. When two rows are complete the game is over. The incomplete row scores negative for everyone controlling a building on it.

The pieces you can auction are building levels, roofs, permits that allow you to grow or shrink a row, a permit canceling cube, and the mayor - who doubles the value of a row, whether positive or negative. The building levels come in 6 colors and have values ranging from 1-6. The first player to build in a color "owns" that color for the rest of the game and scores it. Buildings are scored by whoever owns the top level, so buildings can change ownership numerous times. A building is finished when a roof is added.

So with the building options, permits, and auctions, there is plenty of opportunity to mess with each other's plans. The game is unforgiving and cutthroat and everyone at the table needs to be okay with that to have fun. I love these kinds of games.

Very volatile rating now - hopefully moving up soon, as we played a crucial rule wrong last time.  

The general idea behind the game is fun - I tend to like brutal auction games, and the interaction level is high.  The theme is unoriginal, but the nice pieces make it seem feasible enough.

My main problem with the game lies in the lack of hidden information, giving you the ability to calculate everyone's score.  This produces potential A/P and kingmaking problems, neither of which are enjoyable.  If we can play it quickly, I could see myself really enjoying this.  But if it ends up dragging out, it's just not worth the effort.

This is an amazing game.  It appears to be an abstract game, but really isn't.  There is a definite beginning, middle and end as you create your neighborhood and managing the end game is hugely important.  If someone re-published this with sculpted house pieces and roofs it would be a huge hit.

Brutal auction game. Knife's-edge navigation between the treasure isles of shared interests and pitiless shoals of fragile investments. Staying solvent through judicious auction choices in order to claim and protect your own stakes and responding properly to mutable prospects and valuations is a difficult, multilayered challenge: in my first game I was absolutely crushed and I want more. Note that some house rules are highly recommended if not necessary.

[b]THANK YOU, SECRET CRAZY PERSON![/b]

Update: after [thread=1515288]dominating[/thread] in my first game, every game I've played since has been a horrible, horrible stomping.  This game is great: very simple rules, sudden catastrophic shifts in position, hilarious arguments over what someone's best move is, fast play with near total engagement by all players (if you're out of money, it's a little grim until it gets back to your turn, but at least you can shout at the other players about what they [i]should[/i] be doing)--I love this game.  I should rate it a 10, but am going with a more conservative 8 in case my love for this game is artificially inflated by being in new-game-withdrawals.

Update, five minutes later: no, after reflecting on how many cool little simple ideas are in this game (like the way the available floors are set up, and the bits which let you grow/shrink rows), and the ease of adjusting the amount of luck (you could play without the blank roofs, although I haven't done that), and how much I want to play it, restraint be damned--I'm calling this a 10.

Update: yeah... I've gotten to play it at least once (sometimes twice) at every one of the last 8 game nights I've gone to, which is a pretty impressive record.

RATING: 7
This is one very beautiful game with top notch components.  It is a pretty simple auction game with a stock market dynamic in which you are trying to get your buildings to be worth the most points at the end.  Three things most people seem to miss or fail to understand when I am explaining the game:

1.  A complete row = one full in which all buildings HAVE a roof.  The game ends when two such rows exist.

2.  The buildings will only score points for the owner of the color of the cube directly under the roof.

3.  The auction is once around and money stays in the game.  Either the auctioneer will receive money from someone OR the auctioneer will pay the highest bidder the cost of the item.  This is where I find most people struggling to properly value what to put up for auction.  There is often little value to putting up one of your own color cubes that is high value unless you are wanting to fill a row OR a picket fence.  Think before putting an item for bid.  This is one of the central mechanisms to the game.

This is a heck of a game.  Impossible to find, especially now that the publisher is no longer in business.  However, its not out of the realm of possibility to make the game.  My brother made a copy and it looks wonderful.

All of that being said, if you happen to be at BGG.Con, I know for a fact that they have a copy.

To the game.  Its an auction game, sure, but the lightest auction game on the planet.  Meaning you only have one shot to grab the item.  The person who starts the auction waits until each player has bid or passed.  Then they determine to either pay the highest bid to the highest bidder, or accept the money and give away whatever they were auctioning.

But that's not the best part of the game.  The best part is the strategy involved in the building of the homes.  That's where this game becomes altogether unique.

TRY THIS is you get the chance.

RATING: 9
Rating based on 4 & 5 players.

If you have fun being nasty to other players, this is the game for you. Simple, clever rules make a game where every action you take will impact everyone else, and usually not to their benefit! Alliances will emerge/crumble throughout the game, but as most of the game is about screwing your opponents, none of it can be taken seriously as everyone will be doing the same, even if they don't want to! 

Five players works and is still enjoyable, but the game is much better at four as there is a higher chance that everyone will own a colour... it's more fun when everyone has some skin in the game!

Mechanics are very interesting. The components are great.

I love this game, although I am rarely super confident in my decisions. Right after I make a choice, a better one seems to emerge.

I now only play with the roofs (only 2 blanks used-put the others back in the box) shuffled then flipped and sorted in one line and a player can only auction the ones at the end of the line (just like the dice).

**Update 7/13 - A variant. Play 2 games back to back. In between games, you keep ending cash from game 1. In between games, players have option to cash in embezzled monies (secret choice), or not. Total at end of 2nd game is winner.

I prefer just one game round, though.

I must think this is a good game because I still want to play it when I'm losing.

An odd system of scoring only columns that are complete (fully built houses in all rows) causes some weird actions since you only score certain colors each and there are only certain spaces that each block can be placed in, many pieces are worthless to bid on, while others are extremely valuable. Maybe you need to play it more then once, but as a first try, we all found the game a little not, but not much fun.

Sometimes, after you're done playing a game for the first time, you're left wondering, "What in the heck just happened?"  This is such a game.  Ostensibly, it's an auction game where you're trying to build up and control the three columns of buildings.  I found the gameplay to be very opaque.  Furthermore, at high player counts at least, it seems like players can be eliminated from winning well before the end of the game.

Hilarious and ruthless... I have never seen so many negative points in one game.  Of three rows of houses, the completed ones reward positive points, the incomplete ones negative.  There will always be at least one incomplete row, maybe two, and even all three in rare cases!  The more points you try to get with your houses, the more negative they will be if/when the game ends and they are not completed.  The simplicity is beautiful for such staggering gameplay.  Oh, your row is complete?  You have lots of points there?  I just played a Sonderbaugenehmigung and now this row needs three more houses to complete!  Oh, there are only three roofs left?  Well, that could mean you complete this row now... but one of them is blank!  Haha!  Suck it.  

Endless fun, as long as you aren't playing with people who are capable of sadness or disappointment.

[floatleft][ImageID=323960][/floatleft]At first glance, Neue Heimat is not much to look at but once you get past the rudimentary physical presentation there is a significant amount of game to be had here. Neue Heimat is a superb tactical bidding game where players have to work together to score different rows while at the same time try to screw each other over. I definitely want to add this to my collection.

RATING: 7
This is an intense game where players build towers of blocks of different point values, but players can strategically take control of and score towers by meeting the placement requirement to put their own brick at the top of the stack. This can be prevented by placing a roof piece, which locks the control of the tower, and has an additional printed value. The thing that makes this game insane is that only two of the three rows will score positive points, depending on how much has been built in them, which means your hard work and investment could wind up absolutely devastating you.

RATING: 7
Update May 2012: Upgrade from 5 to 7. The zero-sum auction mechanism is somewhat bland (You're Bluffing is more exciting). However, I realized that players that are behind (those don't own many buildings on the board) could change the game from who has the highest (positive) score to who has the highest negative score!

You can manipulate the end-game scoring triggers such that almost all building score negative. This, of course, rewards the player who controls the least buildings.


Update: February 2012: There are moments of potential co-operation whereby players should work together to ensure that their buildings score. The fuck you factor is quite high; one more could totally screw over a lot of opponents.

Despite this, the game does outstay its welcome; it's starts getting repetitive soon because its auction after auction.

November 2009: This auction game is much blander and less vicious than BGG comments seem to imply. Many times, there's nothing worth offering to auction off. There are actually less opportunities to be nasty in this game since there's a good chance counteracting them.

That said, at least the game moves and plays quickly.

Excellent game balancing an auction with complex strategies.  I highly dislike the poorly-designed random element of the blank roofs and lost turns (if played with this, the game rates about a 5.5), but if blank roofs are treated as score 0 (or some other variant), this is an excellent game (otherwise, it's almost broken.).  Played it using two blank roofs as 0 point additions (no lost turn) and ending the game after 12 roofs were placed . . . AWESOME!  I'll never play the lost turn version again!

It's not a bad game, but it just doesn't match my tastes well.  It's got several features of its auction that I don't enjoy - once around bidding, auctioneer doesn't start the bid (minimum price), auctioneer can pay the highest bidder his bid (so a lot of the game is bidding as a minimum what you think the auctioneer will be willing to pay you for it), clock-wise turn order as auctioneer (I prefer when the player who just won an auction and is poorer puts the next piece up for auction, although I can understand that would screw up the auctioneer-can-pay-highest-bidder mechanism),  and money is not worth anything at the end.  These along with the very abstract nature of what you are bidding for (color ownership, one of 1 to ~5 spots you could place a cube, one of 1 to 6 spots you could place an extender/reducer, etc.) combine to form a game that I can see is pretty good but that I never want to play again.  Placement of the roofs it the most interesting, and ironically that's the one part that is randomized, with the auctioneer not knowing what value will be drawn from the bag.  I also don't enjoy the flow of the game - early on, while your decisions are very important, it's hard to predict what impact those decisions will have; mid-game bidding is most critical; and then near the end, the bidding can become meaningless because there is only 1 legal place to place a cube. But if you love that unpredictability and that constant tug-of-war between trying to screw other players and defend yourself from being screwed, you might love this one.  There are just so many better auction games with more theme, why play this abstract one?

Wow.  What a brutal auction game.  Bid on pieces and play them to the board, on your or your opponents pieces.  Screwage is an integral part of this game.  Just when you think you have a some great points in a row, one players action can turn it into something far from a sure thing.  The nice thing about this game is that there is an all-fail mechanic that helps those players that find themselves in a hole.  In our first game I quickly found myself in a deep hole and managed to make a game out of it by dragging the other two players in after me.

RATING: 5
Acquired this because I was interested in the surplus-transfer auction, a multiplayer version of the kind found in Edel, Stein & Reich and Lowenherz. This game is all about cooperating and backstabbing, and offers plenty of opportunities to try and swing other players to your side, because your points can be covered up, and your locked-in points can become negative!

The weird rule is the possibility of putting aside $1M for 1 VP every turn (the Chapel in San Juan), but I guess that sets a risk-free benchmark for the game, making you take the velocity of money into account? Skeptical, seems like almost a tack-on.

First play was underwhelming, as we seemed to undervalue everything (player valuations in a closed economy can really swing the game). I felt like how I did after my first play of Modern Art/Chicago Express/Imperial/all other collusive games: that there seemed very little control. Repeated plays of those games proved that control is subtle, long-term, and embodied in mixed signals, but I'm not sure of the runway for Neue Heimat. Repetitive play (auctions every round), plus the trick-taking game style of rinse and repeat 3 rounds with no change in the stakes, makes me reluctant to give this more chances.

3+2

This is a nasty little abstract auction game.  There are a number of pretty straight forward elements that are all too familiar from other Euros but they are all stirred enough to feel like something new.  

In addition to being an auction game this is in some ways a stock game (as you buy into colors).  Points are swingy and people can easily be in either first place or last place depending on the caprice of others.  Five is perhaps too much for this game.

Players can be out with no hope of winning and still have to play through.  This can easily end in kingmaker situations.

Still, it is fun.

We played a 3-player game of this last night & I really liked the dynamics ... The impact of the closed pool of money did not come through just by reading the rules and this aspect really made this game shine for me.  The ebb & flow of money and watchig who is gobbling it up becomes a big part of the game - and influences your tactics regularly ...

I really liked it & am looking forward to playing some more.

One of the most enjoyable games I have played in a long time. Incredible components and thoughtful game play make for a can't miss opportunity. The whole real estate chrome, while successful, really layers on top of what amounts to a very very tight auction game. A lot of depth comes in this small package. Well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Really, really cool auction element with plenty of wronk.  There are a couple of different ways to win and many elements going on with the closed economy.  The interplay of the different elements is a bit unusual, so I highly recommend that you give the game a couple of chances before giving up on it; I think experienced players would really enjoy it, especially in the short time frame it takes to play.

UPDATE: Perhaps the most interesting auction-style game I have ever played. Essentially you end up with moving-target partnerships over the course of the game and sometimes your opponents will be working for you and other times working against you. It's hard to wrap your head around what is a good item to put up for auction the first time and how to work from your current position into how to win, but every time I play it, I consider it an hour of compelling, tense decisions with a ton of interaction. This is one of the finest boardgames of all time.

My rating might be somewhat low.  Further play will determine whether it goes up or down, and it might go either way.  Neue Heimat is in the incentive manipulation genre with Chicago Express and concludes in about the same amount of time.  It has an idiosyncratic visual appeal to it.  The rules are dead simple.  Good play is not.  

My issue with the game is that the first several moves seem relatively unimportant to the outcome.  They set up the incentives of the game.  These incentives shape subsequent events.  But it is so easy to alter those outcomes, in some cases dramatically, that I wonder how meaningful the first half of the game is.  Not that half of this game is a long time. But still.

I'm not a big fan of abstract games. I'm also not a big fan of auction games. Also for both of these reasons, I'm not a big fan of Neue... 

The game is abstract and based on an auction mechanism but my problem with it is mainly because players perform actions from the beginning until a large part of the second half without controlling anything of what's happening. As an example, I may play one time getting 20VP's and I may play a second time, with the exact same decisions based on the exact same information that I had before and score MINUS 20VP's.

I was introduced to this with the description 'it's a really vicious bidding game'. And it really is. 

I tried to force an alliance with another player who refused (it would have let me win and put him second), so I built everything on my own and gave him second anyway. It was more expensive than planned, but worked out.

What a clever, vicious game. Sure, there's some luck involved but that little bit of chaos keeps the game from bogging down in AP.

Update: Played with a group of gamers, this is brilliant and as much about making other pay you to avoid catastrophe as it is about wanting to do anything productive. We played twice back to back and in the second game the winning score was zero - and second was minus 39!

Rating up from 7.5 to 9.

Played once with 3 players. Definitely a nasty little game that has to be played more than 1 round.

Winsome fans should be all over this one.  Deep, thoughtful auctions and an extra helping of spite.  Really a fantastic game.

We play with these variants:

1. Blank roofs are worth zero (the building is still worth the value of the cubes in it).
2. Put the roofs in a single face-up row.  Allow players to select a roof from either end of the row for auction.
3. Play twice.  Total the score from both plays.

This is the most cruel and twisted auction game I have ever encountered. You can really mess with peoples' plans, buildings, and scores. It's just fragile all around. When you have several skilled players, there is a multitude of possibilities to screw and get screwed. The auctions are very tense too. Sometimes I find myself auctioning on something when I realize half-way through the auction that the piece would do me no good!

Good fun. Highly recommended if you want something unique--albeit hard to acquire at the moment.

Excellent bidding game with plenty of opportunities for screwage.  The mechanism that requires the auctioneer to pay the highest bidder if they want to keep the item is brilliant.  This creates a new incentive for outbidding other players and adds even more tension to an already tense game.  Neue Heimat is one game where the paper money is welcome, as money is hidden and you can slide a bill under the board at the start of the turn to stash it in your "off shore account".  Trying to hoard cash seems like a viable strategy in these types of games, but never seems to quite work out the way you want it to.  We play with two blank roofs as zeros and end the game after 12 roofs have been placed.  We like this better than losing your turn if you draw a blank roof.  The "no color" strategy is fun to play, but can be difficult if only one player is going for it.  We've only played one round in a night, but I'm curious about keeping a running tally - it could definitely add a new wrinkle to an already outstanding game!

Such a cool closed economy. The simple ruleset and even the chunky blocks you get to auction then place into a stacked concordance has a tactile pleasure.

It has a way of drawing the players together; yes, yes, a cut throat game, but every bid, every move, it's like everyone nods & lightbulbs flicker around the table. I love the feeling it produces. 

The shared incentive structure is well knit, and is more seeable than more opaque games like Chicago Express & Container. And it has a quicker resolution as well.

Mechanically working, but I did not like most of the mechanics: 
1) Closed (almost) economy with bidding. Very tired of this kind of games.

3) I didn't like actions, where it was possible to change length of the rows.

Very chaotic and interactive game. Not even close to my cup of tea,

Lots of fun.  I love putting the other players in awkward position to extort them for money.  Very cool game with emergent alliances across many spaces.  All players can be aligned with each other but in different rows.  How this plays out will also favour particular rows and alliances for the end game trigger.  You have the power to manipulate this if it is not to your advantage.

1 play, mostly to figure out how the game flows. I'll adjust my score after another game or two. 
I'm not the worlds biggest bidding fan, but it seems like a pretty cutthroat Euro which are somewhat rare. (Although most end up as bidding games).
Reminds me of Chicago Express where pseudo "teams" or business partners crop up. Interesting game, just not sure yet how I'd personally rate without some more plays. I am intrigued by the bizarre game flow and strategy though.

Strange auction game, or we just did not have a clue how to play it properly. Most of the time bidding (or mostly passing) on something only one player had any interest in if even that. I did not even get a colour so that I could score points! Ended up nearly winning anyway by screwing everybody else turning their hard-earned points into negative points.

Played some more, and it is really rubbish. It seems to typically degenerate into a scramble to avoid negative points, so why bother investing in building/colours at all and not just hoard money to tank the game towards the end for negative points for everybody who actually played; and then whoever did not actually play and happened to remember to stash cash away every turn (and is one of the first players who gets a turn more than others) is likely to win. - Though, I have an idea how to maybe prevent someone from tanking the game to try if I ever play this game, again.

All the "fun" of building concentration camps or Eastern European council estates or something.

A brilliant, cut throat auction game. The rules are simple but the gameplay is deep. This game isn't kind to new players because it takes a few rounds to understand the nuances. On first play, I made mistakes in the begiing that cost me the game in the end. Would definitely play this again though.

A short, tense auction game where extortion is the order of the day. I like it! The popular variant that "0" roofs make a building worth zero is great (sometimes you'll want to play it on yourself, to avoid negative VP- that should tell you how brutal this game is). The closed economy works well here- liquidity is control, and auctioning the item you think will fetch the highest bid while also serving your longer term goals is a tough, interesting decision. Not at all a game for control freaks- the game is very swingy, decidedly unstable and honestly chaotic. But there is undoubtedly room for finesse, conniving, and just downright evil. Looking to explore this one.

This was quite a surprise. A heavy auction game made out of a kindergartener's toy block kit. The game is quite short and maybe even a little bit silly, but there are a ton of decision points, auction evaluations and both offensive and defensive move possibilities, all via a very simple auction mechanic and a completely closed economy. It's quite fascinating and the end result is a game that is much more of a brain burner than you would possibly expect out of such a small package. It's tough (and pricey) to get ahold of, but you could probably make your own for $25 bucks in parts and a little time, if you wanted. I won't tell if you don't. ;)

Grail game for a reason. Auction dice placement city builder on a small neighborhood board of three rows divided by a river. At setup you think OK this is quaint, straight forward enough... And then the twists. Other players can build vertically on your dice and steal your points, you can put a roof on buildings to lock in gains or shut others out, move the mayor down the street to double your row or double screw the incomplete community suckers that could lose points! If that weren't enough, there is auctioning for the naked notched and plain cubes to move or cancel the size of the community rows when you thought it was in the bag. Dig the closed economy aspect and the interesting dynamic from stashing money away. I love how your color is determined kind of like eight ball with the first ball you make. I also dig the perfect information of the future colored auction dice in a 3-high block auctioning from the outside in--you see the complete distribution of colors and values from the beginning. The only game I can think of with a viable win strategy of just foiling others--but you won't make any friends. So good, so evil.

A mean-spirited auction game that makes me all tingly.  The allocation of player colors, three-dimensional building strategies, and game-ending mechanics are mind-bendingly unique.

It's too bad that this imported game is piece-intensive and hard to find.  Expect to pay big bucks if you want a copy.

Also, [i]Neue Heimat[/i] isn't perfect.  For example, it seems too easy through collusion to make multiple rows impossible to finish.  In our first play, at game's end, two of the three rows were incomplete and therefore earned negative points.  This meant final scoring came down (essentially) to the players who were least hurt by the negative rows.  Not entirely satisfying, but not entirely unsatisfying either.

3p learning game.  Wife was runaway leader due to me teaching 3rd player who it just did not click with.  Neat to see possibilities.

Even more neat to learn about the 'no owned color' strategy that could be super fun to try.

Two rounds in, wife exclaimed "I love this game!" Which is super rare for her to emote, let alone about an auction game.

My impressions: Once I got over the irritation of having to re-explain concepts and basically give away my strategy... I loved it.  Awesome game can't wait for more plays.

An abstract euro, but with a lot of player interaction, no downtime, and plenty of fun. A blast.

Pro: Closed money system, which can lead to clever manipulation of your opponents.
Pro: The board has certain spaces where the buildings can only grow one high; however…
Con: The way the one-story spaces are indicated — with a picket fence around them — is cute and clever when the board is empty, but too easy not to notice when it starts to fill.  It is a minor inconvenience.
Pro: The bidding and placement are much more interesting than I predicted.  Often you are bidding on things in which you have no vested interest because you can place them in ways that are probably damaging to your opponents.
Con: The game can end with you very surprised to have a big negative score.  It provides suspense, but it can give you a bit of a feeling of having accomplished nothing.

This is a rather unusual 3D building game with bidding and manipulation of the players and the playfield, made with excellent bits.  Definitely worth playing, with the minor risk that you don't savor one of the elements of the game.

After 1 Play: A game I'd never heard of until someone brought it to our weekly game group. Beautiful components, and some really neat gameplay. It was a little too chaotic with 5 players, but I can see it being really great with 2-4.

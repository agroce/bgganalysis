The game plays fluent, the rules are clear and easy to understand. But it will not become a topgame. Hard to explain why, but it misses some pepper and salt.

A fun theme and solid mechanics, but hampered by minimal player interaction.

played a prototype with Seth Jaffe from TMG. Interesting theme. Felt very much like early settlers with some good, tough decisions - do I get a bigger wagon or do I get more supplies? a little slow, but one that was a fun, well-designed game. I'd play again.

Fun enough dice drafting game. Not outstanding but would play on occasion.

RATING: 7
Played at Essen with 4 players. It's an okay little dice drafter where, like many euros, you'll have to choose between cashing or upgrading. That the remaining die triggers disasters that potentially hurt everyone is a nice addition. The balance between luck, mitigation of bad fortune and play time is well done.

It's a real solid, well thought out game that never feels it's theme - like euros seldomly do. Production is anything but flimsy but I would've chosen another art style. It just wasn't special enough to spend 50 euros on.

Dice-drafting game reminiscent of The Oregon Trail. While you pursue your strategy, you must be prepared for impending disasters such as storms, disease, raids, and famine.
Round by round, players draw dice out of the bag, roll them, then take turns drafting one to either collect silver, hire a townsfolk, or take an action based on the die value. Townsfolk confer immediate or constant benefits as well as end game scoring bonuses, while actions help you collect wood, medicine, cattle, equipment, and gold nuggets. The unchosen die each round advances one of the disaster tracks based on its color, and when a disaster gets to the end of its track, all players must deal with its effects:

Polished dice drafter with a sting in its tail.

A game of Dice drafting where the chosen dice triggers an action, or income, or the taking of a citizen card.  Some dice you draft trigger combos of effects from your previously selected cards and equipment.  The dice not selected each round trigger a disaster track which eventually causes one of a number of different disasters to happen.  Over the course of a game most of these disasters will likely happen at least once.

It plays in an hour and gives a good amount of decisions in that time without ever feeling heavy or difficult.  Variable powers of your starting characters, as well as a number of decks of character cards, means that there is a huge amount of variety to explore in the game.

I enjoyed it with the exception of the TMG artwork. It's a personal thing but I really do not like the TMG in-house cartoon style illustrations which they used on Harbour, Belfort, and which destroyed the previously brilliant Colosseum.  Other than that the game is well-presented and very good.

Miscarried theme lapses aside, the game was pretty entertaining.  Moved along at a good pace, and you had quite a few options on your turn, and the use of the events was also done pretty well, for a Euro.  Lots of cards gives some variety, but we messed up some final scoring round rules.  Decent presentation with ridiculously thick tiles.

After the very good Yokohama and the good Chimera Station, this felt again a bit like Scoville or Captains of Industry: good games, but nothing extraordinary nor special. I can't say there is something wrong about this game, but it won't turn on my fire neither. It's the kind of game you won't refuse playing if someone asks after it, but I'll doubt I'll chose this one out of my collection.

played at bgg.com.  tried it beasue the theme is right up the ally.  it was an okay little game that works but I have so many of these types of game that I do not need another.  I keep looking for the great western settler expansion game and I get light games with that theme laid on top

Possibly the best game I bought at Essen 2017, and certainly the most interesting dice drafting game I know. Every turn goes quickly (as with most dice drafting games), but also presents you with an interesting decision: do you invest more in your chosen path to victory (collecting townsfolk, cattle, items, or whatever else you need for the long term and  intermediate scoring opportunities) or do you invest in controlling the damage caused by the next disaster waiting to happen? Or will you trigger the upcoming disaster now, so that other players suffer more losses than you? The game is mostly tactical (because of the dice), but requires some planning as we - making this more of a gamers’ game than the cartoony artwork suggests. To round off this excellent package, the game does not outstay its welcome in terms of game length, and scales very well between 2 and 4 players. The cardboard components are really thick, just too bad that the colors of the wooden disaster markers are a bit off. And I think the biggest drawback is that in a four player game it is hard to remember which player has which scoring marker (they really should have added a second wagon for each player to place in front of their player board). All in all a game the game certainly hits my sweet spot, and I therefore expect my rating to increase even more with further plays.

“Nice thick components - like the designer (Chris Marling)” :-D

Very good, interesting dice drafting, engine building game with agonising decisions with constant threats of looming disasters.

American West colored special dice drafter with variable power frontier settlers.  Each face has provides either a coin amount, a recruit, or an action, and the color of the dice not drafted advances the disaster track.  Fill your wagon with equipment, ranch cattle, try your hand at gambling, prospect for gold each day of four weeks bringing supplies to each town along the way for favors.  Draft decisions indirectly influence the advancing storm, raids, livestock famine, and disease.  Good decisions and surprisingly interactive.

Draft one die for your action. At the end of a round one die will be left and that color advances one of the disaster tracks (or all 4 if the die is black!). Looked balanced after one play. Plays in about an hour with 4. Nice game.

Interesting light worker placement/dice drafting mechanics in a nicely themed game.
Possibly slightly unbalanced due to some supporting character cards, TBC...

RATING: 8
A dice drafting game with a LOT of layers and interesting decisions. At first glance it appears really simple and straightforward, but as you play you realise there's an awful lot to consider and some very subtle ways to influence/hurt the other players. And the components are great!

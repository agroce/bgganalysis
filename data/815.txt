The best thing about this game is the name.  I didn't mind the slanted take on US history and the game mechanics are logical enough but the game overall is a complex snoozefest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I tend to like Looney Labs, and this game is probably my favorite by them.  The theme is really cute and works well, and there is a lot more strategy than Fluxx, but not so much that random things can't happen to change everything up.  The way the timeline works is very innovative, and the fact that preventing John Lennon's assassination prevents Columbine from happening always makes me think a little bit about the values of the sixties, something that can be seen in most Looney Labs games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Great theme for a game, but the strategy element is lacking.  Winning is determined by luck of the draw. Good light game to have with conversation, but not much more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very innovative design.  I absolutely love the Linchpin mechanic and how flipping one card can affect several down the line.  Forces you to plan ahead.

I found the victory conditions to be a bit lacking however.  3 ways to win (which is good), but they all seem somewhat random in nature.  It seemed like anyone could win at any time, and there wasn't too much skill involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun, light, quick card game with multiple ways to win. The time line, the subject matter, and the mechanics are simple and brilliantly implemented. Obviously somewhat cannabis inspired, not that there's a single thing wrong with that.

Not bad... very quick crazy game, where you mess with the TIME. Cool ideas but the game is VERY random and seems uncontrolable. Main target: screw-up the other players and try to win in the meantime. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Reasonable.  Quite fun and satisfying seeing Hitler die and John Lennon and JFK live!
the game itself is very much Flux-like and ok - not more than that for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A decent filler game with a promising premise (changing history) that just feels poorly executed.

+Unique theme
+Interesting mechanic: changing one event affects subsequent events

-Artifact collecting missions are much easier to complete than character goals.
-Deck too diluted with cards that don't actually affect the timeline.
-Too much randomness and not enough strategy.

(Solo) 
Awesome fluxx-like card game.

I enjoy this far more than fluxx. The screw cards are still there, but are far fewer and less prominent. This lets you play a more strategic game than it's predecessor. 

On top of that, I really think the theme shines through as you go through time altering things. 

What keeps this from getting to the table more often? Set up and tear down. There are a lot of cards to deal with and it can be a pain getting everything out or put back away.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun little filler which can occassionally drag on a bit too much. Don't think the expansions work though as they don't integrate back to the original at all so you can easily tell if someone has the objective for it as they only ever flip expansion timeline cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.3
I do enjoy this game a lot. It was one of the first games I played, and it really helped with learning history and discussing potential historical linchpins that could have affected the outcome of the world. The gameplay itself is enjoyable and the cards' subtexts are witty. And having multiple ways to win means there's more strategy. Most people can pick up the game pretty quickly and can play it multiple times. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably the best game theme I've played, but it can be a touch too long for a game so random. Also very expensive for a deck of cards.

RATING: N/A
In order to make the game playable, remove all of the artifacts, action, and mission cards.  Draw multiple ID cards and have everyone focus on getting as many of their Chronauts home as possible.  The game starts to feel less like Fluxx and a little bit more like a [light] strategy game.

I like time travel but I wish I could go back and not play this game again, well it's not that bad, a bit like Fluxx, can be fun but most likely it will just drag out and when you think you were playing well some lucky sod goes and wins just before you were about to play out a great combo.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

As a general rule, I tend to dislike take that style of games. So I went into Chrononauts knowing I wouldn't have like it.

The idea of altering time is actually pretty neat and is implemented fairly well. The problem is all the rest. You have to keep drawing cards until you find what you need, then if someone else draws that card and discards it you need to wait to finish the deck and then you start hoping again. It's an exercise in frustration.

This flaw is made even worse by the fact that you can play an alternate event just to see it discarded by another player flipping a card back. Then it's drawing and hoping time again.

There's two types cards in this game that make you search either the deck or the discard pile for a card and play it immediately. This game could have been a deck of white cards with some cards saying: "if you play three of these cards, you win". Because that's essentially what these cards do and what this game is.

In a game where you might have to wait to draw through a deck two times to get the card you want, having a card that gets you what you want is priceless.

For all of these reasons Chrononauts is another example of the lazy game design that goes into making take that games. Put some humor, some cards that allow you to screw your opponents (which by the way are always the same in every game of this kind) and call it a game. Not recommended at all! Bad, bad, bad!

FAMILY, THEMATIC

I may be the only one in my group of friends that likes this sci-fi card game. The goals in this game are to change history's timeline in a certain way and to travel through time to collect various valuable objects.

It plays better with more, rather than fewer, players. In some ways, it is similar to Clue, since it involves bluffing and deduction.

Recommended with 1-5 players (best 4). 30 mins.

Fluxx very, very well themed. But not as good a game as the unthemed (and considerably more demented) original. The solitaire game intrigues me, however. It's also kind of cool how Martin Luther King Jr. can become president of America thirty-four years before Barak Obama does.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
There are a few games like this, Fidelitas comes to mind, where you've got a shared tableau of cards that you're trying to manipulate against your opponents and so unless you're playing 2P, it's basically going to come down on the luck of the draw whether there's ever an opportunity to achieve something within your turn, or simply mess up the board state for others. I'm not a huge fan of the genre and, according to the people I played the game with, there's no good mechanism in the game to make the game length consistent, so you could end up with a 10 minute game or a 2 hour game, just depending on what came out of the deck, who it went to, and what the tableau looked like at that moment. While I haven't experienced that, I classify any light/filler game with that possibility as "broken", hence the sub-5 rating.

If you like this game, I'd suggest migrating to Gloom. It's a better implementation of this style of game, but gives you your own tableau, so that you can actually advance reliably.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun game, and better than Fluxx, but a bit fluffy. I found it's only really fun if played with the right group (i.e. people willing to tell the story of their action whilst doing it). When played silently, with just the mechanics involved, it is only a "so so" experience.

A+ on theme, though!

RATING: 7.3
Fluxx-like game with interesting theme of time travel. Good entertainment sometimes, but not for serious play. I think the game limits too much making of alternative timelines, as it's always easier to restore normal history than make a new one. This makes often the play with timeline be just a spice to artifact collecting.

Chrononauts was a lot of fun when we first got it. That is until all the fun of the theme dried up. The game istelf isn't very susbstantial. Again, this is a game with a limited number of plays.

It has been a while since I have played this game.  I enjoy the time traveling aspect of this game as well as creating alternative universes.  I have played this with kids at my camp and they seem to enjoy it but have run into many times the kids having no idea about a certain historical event.  This is not a game for everyone but I find it enjoyable when I play it, though truth to tell it has not been played for a long time.

I'm a bit conflicted. This game shares many flaws with Fluxx: extremely luck-based, dependent on drawing just the right cards, can go for 5 minutes or 45 without any way of telling which. 

On the other hand, it has a great science-fiction theming, and a hilarious role-playing aspect ("I go back in time and trip myself before I trip myself to stop myself from saving the Hindenburg.") which can make it a lot of fun.

It's like playing "Back to the Future" only every player has a time machine.

Multiple ways to win is fun.
The keepers are fun.

However, the game is a little complex and might turn casual gamers off.

Also has Solitaire rules (which is one of the reasons I bought it)

The best game about time travel ever written, with great mechanics and clever alternate histories. With multiple win conditions, plus two simple mini-games, it's a personal favourite. I'd love a less Americo-centric version - the history only goes back to the early twentieth century, and covers little of non-American history beyond the world wars. Given that you can collect live dinosaurs, it'd be great to have ancient history/geologic time.

RATING: N/A
It always feels rather daunting to even try to teach others Chrononauts, but the new insert in Early American Chronauts may help in this regard.

I do like the Chrononauts solitaire.  I think Chrononauts combined with Early American Chrononauts is the best way to have a game (since people need to achieve all three victory conditions; otherwise it's far too easy to score in the simplest and most boring condition).

I wish many more of the artifacts depended on particular states of the timeline, rather than just being more or less random.  I have not yet tried Uberchrononauts, which requires all three winning conditions (boost hand size to 10, finish up on artifacts missions, and accomplish a lot of timeline patching).

Personally I think the game would be better if you put in some relevant timeline information on the artifacts cards so that you could only play them when the timeline was in a particular state.

I enjoy Solonauts the best...

RATING: 6.5
This is a card game which allows you to go back and forth in time and change events, create and fix paradoxes, grab artifacts and so on, whilst presenting you a number of ways to win. Each player has a personal mission linked to their character, a set of artifacts to collect or can build their hand up to ten cards. Any of these get you the win.

Loved this card game when I first played it. Cool idea, and it is quick, but it has lost some luster since the first play. It would be better if some alternate time cards could be rotated in.

RATING: 7
As a filler game, Chrononauts is great, so long as everyone plays quickly. Played as a slow, methodical game... not so good.

Chrononauts is a card game, mostly. Some of the cards are laid out in a specific pattern that represents the path of time. Players take the rolls of time travellers who want to accomplish certain goals (steal useful artifacts from the past, for instance) or change the timestream so that their future/present exists, rather than another one.

It should give gamers who hate luck-based games nightmares. I recommend it to people who are not like that.

An early favorite of ours and our go-to game before we started playing Race for the Galaxy. Multiple paths to victory and pretty chaotic, but I think it's a good thing here. Played with two, three and four players, and honestly I think two is the best - three and four, especially if they don't get it, can be a drag.

Well done. The theme is so engaging and different from other card games that I cant compare it to anything. The premise is time travel and the goal is to "fix" anomalies or gather artifacts (a few paths to victory). It is a great alt history lesson. Just give it a go if you like the time travel theme. I loved it. imo, play it fast and keep it moving.

Another take-that card game from Andy Looney. It seems pretty silly that to succeed in the game you just need to wait till you draw certain cards from the deck. There's like zero strategy aside from whether you play your cards or leave them in your hand to be stolen by other players from there. Dunno, clearly a Fluxx cousin.

game just doesn't work for me at all. It needed a few more months of playtesting. It takes too much time for what it is. We play with a house rule that you have to succeed at 2 missions to win with artifacts--otherwise we always won that way and not through correcting the timeline. The game has a really neat idea, but it just falters. Perhaps it would be better with more than 2-players, because it usually turns into undoing changes to the timeline your opponent just made.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Entertainingly hippyish game about mucking around with the Twentieth Century. It's pretty easy to get blocked from winning, by pure randomness -- but happily there are three different victory conditions so, if one gets shut down, you can always go for option #2 or #3. And the alternative histories are very amusing. President Martin Luther King, Senator John Lennon, etc.

This is a completely random, silly game. There is no point in trying to pursue a strategy: the winner will be most likely determined by the deck. Some of my gaming buddies really like it, so I play it from time to time (at least the theme and some cards are humorous).

There's always so much going on in Chrono.  The design element that makes Chrononauts stand out is the multiple victory conditions.  The doorway to winning is never closed, and every turn brings a chance to work yourself one step closer to success even if that's in a different direction.  It has just enough strategy to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something, and just enough luck to keep things exciting.

RATING: 2
I could forgive Fluxx its stupidity, but not this game, which is just Fluxx with pointless chrome and confusion. Can we at least let people draw cards at the *end* of their turn instead of the beginning? This is such a basic game design concept of NOT WASTING PEOPLES' TIME that it betrays serious amatuerism. There is some genuinely good humor in here (and this the only reason the game gets a 2 instead of the 1 the actual design roundly deserves), but the game design itself is a pointless retread of a dumb game. The total deal-killer, and why this is just Fluxx but worse, is that it's actually moderately long. At 15-20 minutes, it would be a painless time-killer (like Fluxx) and might rate higher. But at 30+, and unlike Fluxx with little chance of putting you out of your misery any earlier, it's complete deadweight.

I sort of feel bad about giving chrononauts a 4, since the theme is outstanding and it does have some genuinely fun bits. The ripple effects are great fun and I even sort of like that the game is a little bewildering.  

Every turn you have to wait a couple of minutes while the players sort out their card draws, search the board for a chain of ripple events and then their mission cards etc. ad nauseum. Truly horrible. So it ends up being way too long for how chaotic and fun it is. The joke wears thin after 45 minutes to an hour.

I think the idea of this game is tremendously entertaining, however in practice the game just did not flow well.  Both times we've played it's been a completely random mess, which drags on as people desperately try to keep the timeline in the state they need.  Then, someone randomly wins, as the timeline happens to be in the right state when their turn starts.

This is one of those games I bring out for non-gamers, as its historical/time travel concept has appealed to many of my friends, and the cards are pretty self-explanatory.  I'll play it on occasion, but not too often; playing it often enough to be able to remember identities and missions is way too often for me.  My favorite part of the game is the text on the identites.  The Mona Lisa shenanigans come in a close second.

A problem I have with this game is that it can sometimes last a VERY long time if players have the cards to keep countering other players' attempts at victory.

I really enjoy this game (much more than it's later stand alone version - Early American Chorononauts), and I'm not quite sure why - possibly because of its multiplayer and solitaire variants, possibly because it's fun messing with the timeline, and possibly because it uses some interesting game mechanics (including multiple win conditions and 1 "everyone loses" condition). However, I also feel that the expansion - Lost Identities is an integral part to the game (as are the promo cards for this game that Looney Labs prints up for various game cons every year).

RATING: 6
Chrononauts is another type of game that surprised me.  It's pretty thematic, and relies on the player being able to identify with key events in (mostly) american history and European history in the past 150 years or so. But the variety of secret starting goals and alternate histories are amusing to play with. 

While technically the game can unfold in a variety of different ways with each play through, there is a limit to this variety and most events in time will have just 1 alternate history. 

Also, the secret goals in this game can be a little annoying. The game can end at any time if you accidentally fulfill one of your opponents two hidden criteria for victory.  Sometimes a game ends very quickly, and sometimes it drags out forever as your opponent sequesters one of your victory cards and it has to cycle back through the deck.  


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another go-to card game for our group, this is easily one of my favorites. Between the shifting timeline, player IDs, and mission cards, there are multiple ways to win. Set up can take a few minutes and the instructions can be a bit complicated for new players which may be a turn off for casual gamers. But once the rules are learned, this is a fun, highly competitive game. Playing Squa Tront is always enjoyable and I cannot draw the Teeny Tiny Time Machine without hearing it in a high-pitched voice thanks to one of our game crew. Highly recommended.

The idea behind the game is decent...but this just isn't the genre for me. I like the time travel theme...and the events are interesting. But the luck of the draw seems strong.

My biggest issue is that in order to REALLY play well, detailed analysis of the board and all the ripple effects is necessary. But that can take a long painful time (when someone else is doing it on their turn), and it can be undone by some wacky card draw. 

I'd be willing to play, but it seems too long for a filler, and I'm not usually looking for card game fillers anyway.

A very modular game.  Played solo, it makes for an interesting diversion.  Multi-player, you can play with or without the timeline, which offers two different experiences.  I like the concept, the game is OK, but in my opinion the biggest flaw is the timeline idea.  It's cool at first, but the chaos begins to get old as your tactics are smashed to pieces every turn.  Instead, it would have been more interesting, I think, to have made each player in his own "reality" so that he had to manipulate cards a certain way on his own, rather than ONE change causing the entire board to alter course.

This game isn&#039;t quite broken, but it certainly isn&#039;t very satisfying.  Hidden goals (which comprise two of the three ways to win) make countering the other players next to impossible, and the timeline is far too fiddly and prone to missed changes to be rewarding.  The theme is fun, but the game that supports it is sorely lacking.  Everything good about the gameplay was lifted from Fluxx, which I recommend instead of this game.

Adding more players makes the game much more random.  We remove the "Time Vortex" card and the cards that require passing one's entire hand to the right, since they discourage actual strategy even more than the format of the game in general.  We're time-traveling, old-school!

Easy to play, games can be quick or long in duration depending on luck. Not a lot of strategy that is involved.

I preferred playing it with two people, as you can see the moves they make and you can sabotage, while with more people you lose track of how close someone is to winning.

This is in the same class of the Munchkin; a "take that" card game with a humorous theme. The idea is good and the jokes work well, at least for you first play. 

I doubt it may have any strategy or replayability.

RATING: 8
Pro:
- Fast game;
- Inetersting theme;
- Several win possibilities and thus different strategies possible.

Cons:
- Seems to be too chaotic, solid win always depends on timely arrived patch cards in your hand.
- it seems that "winning by artefacts" is easier then all other possbilities - disbalance.

Result:
- Interesting game to play from time to time.

Clever little game about time travel. Forty or so cards form a timeline on the table, and these cards are either Linchpins or Paradoxes. Linchpins flip to ripple the Paradox, so for example the Titanic may have missed the iceberg and caused changes to events further down the timeline. To win, players must either find their own version of time (ie. flip Paradoxes and &quot;patch&quot; them), collect 3 hysterical artifacts, or build their hand size (by patching Paradoxes) up to ten cards. Great fun, but a little chaotic and Fluxx-y.

RATING: 5
I used to play this all the time as a kid. The inside references to history, humorous time traveler profiles and goals, and just the whole concept of changing the past is a fun theme. Gameplay can be a bit slow, though, and the set up takes up a lot of space.

Chaotic fun.  The best feature of the game is that there's several ways to win.  I occassionally enjoy it, but it has quite a few flaws.  The random draw of cards is punishing, and you'll often sit with a hand full of patches and no inverters.  The cards that let you search the deck and pick a card are necessary to mitigate this, but they slow down the game.  If you happen to have a timepoint that contradicts someone else's card, you'll spend a lot of time just flipping that one back and forth. I used to like this game more than I do now.  My tolerance for this type of randomness and potential for game length drag has definitely decreased over the last year.

A slight improvement over Fluxx in that the subject matter is more defined and makes the game feel somehow more substantial. But it still has all of the "95% out of your control" stench of Fluxx about it, and is pretty much a waste of time for a gamer looking for strategy.

The 55-word fictions are pretty neat though -- each exactly as their title suggests.

Even knowing the game fairly well, it's hard to tell when someone is getting close to their goal. Perhaps if I played more often (I've played perhaps 10 games) I would know the characters well enough to form better hypotheses about what another player needs to win.

Even then, though, there can be no deep strategy. Either I have the cards to stop them, or I don't. There are few resource tradeoff decisions to be made.

This is a mild little card game, that seems to go on for much longer than you'd hoped. Got caught in a few situations where the proper card draws just weren't happening, and the game lengthened considerably. I'm a little dissapointed that such a situation was not foreseen by the play testers or the designer. The game has some potential, but would need a bit of an overhaul to really hit the heights it's capable of. That being said, those heights probably wouldn't raise my enjoyment more than a point or two. 

There's a repetitive feeling here, as you're faced with similar situations from game to game. One game blends into the next, and you feel like you've done all of this before. 

Interesting ideas, but mediocre execution of those ideas.

I enjoy the theme and concept more than playing the game; there is a tendency to get stalled without usable cards (despite a large hand), or because your moves get cancelled. The game has the flaws of a semi-mainstream design: not enough control and lots of "take that" abilities that prevent forward progress.

I keep on thinking up ways to improve the game:
* Reverse Fate only changes linchpins to their alternate forms, reducing played patches being discarded
* Cards to draw patches from draw and discard piles, as it's hard to find the patches you want
* Ability throw out your hand and redraw the same number of cards, as a large hand size doesn't matter because you can only see 2 new cards a turn
* More timeline requirements on artifact cards, as they don't link into the game's major mechanic

The theme for this game is certainly interesting, but this is a very choatic affair, somewhat reminiscent of Fluxx, another game from this publisher.  Whether you win or lose is largely a matter of luck, with most of your decisions being pretty obvious ones given the cards you have in your hand.  However, kids playing this can learn a little bit about 32 significant historical events, if the alternate history on the flip side of the linchpin cards and the patch cards doesn't confuse them too much.  The game can take much longer than what the box would indicate (20-45 minutes), or it can be over very quickly, much like Fluxx.  For me, this is a very light hearted game that does have a small amount of charm, but it's appeal pales in comparison to almost any Euro-game.

I was very dissapointed in this game. The theme was very appealing to me. The gameplay is very boring. Essentially, you have to get the exact cards you need to play to meet very specific victoru conditions, or you have to get 10 cards in your hand, which is difficult to do.

Chrononauts isn't especially good as a game, but the timeline is very well done. I remember introducing some of my older relatives to Chrononauts once: I carefully laid out the deck on a table, explained the premise of the game, and showed them -- with some passion -- how the timeline worked. They spent 10-15 minutes admiring and discussing the cards. Then I packed up the game and we moved on to something else.

What a cool concept and what a horrible execution! The game plays by itself, which can be fun for some but for me is not. After winning 3 times in a row because the other players completed my missions for me I decided it's highly unlikely I will ever play this again.

I like the idea of time travel and have always really wanted this game to be better than it is, but everytime I pull it out I wish I hadn't (and the game - lols). There's a strong Fluxx vibe here with random stuff happening to you (such as all passing your hand to the next player or discarding your objective card).

Overall the game just doesn't work, which is a shame. I wonder if I would enjoy the Back to the Future version.

This is a good light game; it's ingenious and cute, plus it has a terrific theme. Although, I have to admit it is a bit on the chaotic side. In fact, it might just be too chaotic for some people’s taste. Players don’t so much plan out their best moves, as react to their fleeting opportunities. Basically, there is a game board made up of 32 cards, each representing a significant event in history. Some of these events are more important than others and are called "Linchpins." Tampering with them sends shock waves through the time-line to other nodes called ripple events. An altered ripple event becomes a paradox in time. Players are assigned an identity and a mission. They can send the timeline off on a tangent by fiddling with a linchpin or patching a paradox or reversing an altered linchpin. There are three ways to win: alter the time-line to your own time-line (that is, go home), find interesting stuff to sell to collectors and become rich or take over the whole enterprise. In keeping with the theme the random events are RANDOM. It’s fast and fun, in fact, it’s a perfect in-between game. But you have to be in the mood for its insanity. Lovers of history and S.F. should add a point to this rating.

Took me a little bit to get my head around this, but once I did it was a nice card game. I played the solo game, and you have to really think about what you're doing in order to get your time travelers back home. Depending on the cards you draw, you can go to any available time period and cause ripple effects by changing things such as assassinations, and many other events that occurred between 1865 to 1999 to match event requirements shown on your character cards. It's pretty tough to win solo when you have to get 8 characters safely home. My first game, I only got 4 characters safely home before I ran out of cards.

RATING: 7.5
Best time travel game I've yet found that really fits the theme.  Fairly straitforward to teach and understand.  There is a fair amount of chaos as the number of players increases.  It's often hard to determine your opponents' goals, and more than once someone has completed another player's time mission.  (Granted the second player may not claim victory until their turn.)  Having three ways to win is a good touch, as it can be very difficult to complete your time mission if one of your alternate events gets discarded.  The solo game is a very challenging puzzle that requires a lot of planning and has a bit of luck dependancy.

12/10/15 - We've played this a few times. I really, really like the theme. It grabs me. The gameplay itself? Meh. It's difficult to tell where anyone else stands in the game, so there's not as much interaction as you might think -- all you can really do is try to reverse things your opponents do. There's usually only one good option on your turn, if that.

It's okay.  Games seem to drag until someone accidentally patches the timeline that helps another player win.  It's too easy to stop someone from winning via the timeline (just re-flip the linchpin and their patch goes into the discard where it stays for a long time)

Game play based on altering a linear (and very US-centered) time line is OK. Just wish a historian had designed the various "world historical event" Linchpin cards. Suggesting that Lennon's assassination was somehow as pivotal as Franz Ferdinand's is just laughable "USA pop culture" pseudo-history.

Interesting idea. Decently fun solo or with others. The largest problem I have with playing against others: it is easy to figure out which events (years) people are trying to influence or paradox.

[i]Kill Hitler, end the Universe.[/i]

UPDATE:  For best results, treat this as a storytelling party game for history nerds where Linchpins can only be flipped [i]in person[/i].  Take the typical chrono-chaos surrounding "1963:  Kennedy Assassinated" for example:

[q="wibbily wobbly timey wimey stuff"][microbadge=18768] [i]Just as "Oswald" draws a bead on the President's head a time traveler steps out from behind a strange curve and brains the shooter with a tomahawk—

[microbadge=18768] As "Jackie" suddenly pulls a switchblade and stabs Kennedy in the neck—

[microbadge=18768] As "Connally" turns in the front seat and unloads a Model 642 Centennial Airweight .38 Special +P into "her" face, peeling "her" pink pillbox—

[microbadge=18768] As "Abraham Zapruder" takes a knee on the grassy knoll and pops a goddamn RPG straight into the 1962 grille of the custom 1961 Lincoln Continental, blowing it to smithereens— 

[microbadge=18768] As a careening [/i][c][nondescript][/c][i] garbage truck gets air off the knoll, pulping the would-be rocketeer—

[microbadge=18768] As a guy with a limpet mine (originally intended for the re-sinking of the [/i]Titanic[i]) bolts from the crowd and clamps it to the side of the rapidly recombobulating limo—

[microbadge=18768] As we all suddenly discover that limpet mine guy's mom was his dad while his [/i]dad[i] dad was still his dad and so he cancels out like some kind of pesky denominator—

[microbadge=18768] As a Fairchild FH-227D full of Jesuit proto-cannibals makes a sudden detour from 1972 and nosedives into the scene in an obliterating cone of fire—[/i][/q]
And so Dealey Plaza becomes an ever-widening stutter of doings and undoings, up to and including the probable detonation of the Sun itself.

Time travel, you see, is not for the faint of heart—it requires real grit and the kind of single-focus determination one would imagine necessary for [i]continual mass suicide[/i].

Description: Alter key events to change the time stream. Recreate your home universe or collect the artifacts on your shopping list to win!

Pro: Creative timeline design (creating and patching paradoxes). Alternate histories tell a story. Challenging solitaire play (my preferred play style for this game). Great iconography.

Con: Getting the right cards is critical to winning. Since there is only one copy of each important card, having one at the bottom of the deck can prevent a player from winning. Could have had some fantastic alternate history art.

I love the treatment of the theme - it captures the excitement of changing the time line.  For some reason I don't mind the disruption of the Timewarp cards (swap hands, remix hands) as much as I mind similarly disruptive cards in Fluxx.  An interesting game to play solitaire, as well.

Jim's Copy (Updated newer edition).  I've read a lot of reviews panning this game.  I've only played with multiple people a couple of times, so I can't speak to interaction, luck, and skill for 2 or more, but it's a fantastic solitaire game.  The older edition even fits in your pocket! (as long as you're wearing cargo pants).

I've always had a thing for time-travel themed games.  Looney Labs has definitely hit it's stride with this game and I'm especially looking forward to the new Back to the Future themed version.

People who don't like this always seem to compare it to Fluxx. I don't have Fluxx but I thought the thing with Fluxx was that the rules keep changing, maybe I'm wrong bit at least the rules are consistent here.

The idea of the game is probably better than the actual game.

The thing is there are three ways to win, match three timeline statuses, collect three articfact or have a ten card hand. Given the theme of the game the main way to win should be the manipulation of the timeline, but the vast majority of games are won by someone collecting three artifacts. In fact you could probably ignore the timeline and just discard until you get your three artifacts and have a pretty good chance of winning. The game is almost completly all luck.

Despite all this I quite like playing it. It's not a very long game and it is quite humourous.

RATING: 3
A compelling theme - competing time travellers from different futures trying to change events to their liking - is given the Fluxx treatment, with predictably disappointing results. Regardless of which win condition you're aiming for, gameplay is ruled by the action cards that allow you to target individual cards on the table, in the discard pile or in the draw deck, instead of having to rely on lucky draws. And then there's the usual "change hands" and "change objectives" cards.

I so want to love this game. Love the idea and the mechanic, but the problem is in the play. On almost every turn, my hand contains no cards that can be used to further my agenda.

RATING: 6
This game is just fun. It may not use the best mechanics or be the most strategically challenging game ever, but it is an absolute hoot!  The basic idea is that you lay out cards to represent the "correct" time stream.  The players are time travelers ("Chrononauts") who are trying to achieve different goals, which they accomplish by twisting up and then "fixing" history to read as they want it to be.  To really enjoy it, you need to just let go and get into the action, doing your best to make up silly methods you use to change history.

While I MIGHT be convinced to play this again - and only because the first game took less than two rounds to be over - the game was so random that someone could start the game with a hand that wins in two rounds.

2014-01-21: 4p game. What an odd game. I was starting to get the hang of it when suddenly one of the other players caused everyone to have to swap hands with another. All my strategy? Poof. Okay, so recover.. annnnd another player wins. Just.. out of the blue. Not rating because it was one play and I don't feel I had enough of a chance to give it a fair shake, but it feels too random and chaotic for this Eurogamer.

The concept is interesting, the historical material is also fun but there are lacking a lot of stuff. For example, the artifacts are useless. It's just collect a set to win. The games is also pretty much chaotic, and can be either pretty quick or long. The mission to win are also accomplished pretty randomly. So there is a good base concept is just that it could be developped more or better.

A fun time travel game that is a more complex game than Fluxx. With three different paths to victory you have ample opputurnity to win the game in different fashions.

Looney Labs is known for quick, rules-light games with just enough of a twist to give them appeal -- stuff like Fluxx and Loonacy.  Chrononauts is probably their deepest game, hewing largely to the draw one/play one mechanic, but giving it a great theme, a wide board of cards, and a lot of moving pieces to keep track of in order to win.  It's still pretty simple once you get the hang of it, and there's multiple victory conditions, but you have to pay  a lot more attention, and the randomness of the draw can be offset by watching your opponents and playing defensively.

The time travel idea is fun, and you get the kick of actually seeing what would happen if you really did go back and kill Hitler.  It's also suffused with Andrew Looney's sense of humor and sensibilities.

I really like this game. I've only played 3-4 times so far and a couple with the solitary variant, which is lots of fun (and I haven't been able to win yet). I love sci-fi and time travel is always a difficult subject for a game... I wish you could actually travel between different time lines all represented with the cards, but that's beyond the scope of the game, which is simple, quite fast, and fun. Also, the 3 ways to win are perfect for when one of the cards you need is in the bottom of the deck, just try something else...

funn, but a bit hard to describe and teach.  Setup is a bit fiddly.  Also, sometimes several turns go by where nothing happens as players repeatedly draw-and-discard, waiting for particular card(s) they need.

Would be a 6.0 but Artifaxx boosts it up  a half-point.

The Artifaxx variant is easier--so much so that I've actually played it more than the base game (not a lot of either).  I'd like to try a game of Uber-Artifaxx (but would it be worth $40 = $20 * 2 games ??).

We are also thinking about trying a house-variant that isolates the the time-line aspect.  We figure the artifacts are just a distraction from that part of the game.

Did not have a chance to finish our game, but what I played was very original and fun.  I'm not a big fan of time travel stuff, so it took a little bit to get into the game, however, like most Looney Labs stuff, it was amusing and quick.  I'd love to play again.

Really fun theme/idea. It can get a little too sprawling spacewise and is kind of a drag to set up too. Gameplay is alright but the theme makes up for some of the shortcomings.

RATING: 6
Interesting timeline-altering game with hidden identities. Shame it's almost entirely Western/American history, but still entertaining. Can go on a bit too long sometimes, especially when two players keep flipping the same cards back and forth and it's entirely possible to accidentally help another player win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Neat concept. Poor execution. The game takes longer to set up than to play. Like early versions of Fluxx, turn 1/turn 2 wins are possible. This makes for an unrewarding game experience.This is possibly one of the worst games I've played.

[3-10-2012] Flash forward 47 months. Initial game experience was circa 2000. 

The game rules are a little awkward, but workable. The game graphics help with game play. The game is Fluxx-esque. If you like it, you may, emphasis on May..., enjoy this one too. 

Once you've wrapped your head around the rules the game is fairly easy to explain and fairly easy to play. 

Revised rating from 2 to 6.

Played for the first time last evening at Bruce's house.  Not my favorite game, it was ok, I guess.  Took the first game for me to figure what was going on and in the second game, I could not seem to get any favorable cards.  As for card games, I prefer something like Bang or even Rock Band.  This would be fine as a quick filler game, but definitely not my first choice for a game.

RATING: 6
Played it a few times with just 2, and enjoyed it, but seems sort of unpredictable in terms of planning and knowing when the endgames is near.  Further plays, and with more people, might increase my rating on this one.  Based on these early plays, there are other 2 player card games I'd suggest playing instead.

I think we need to sit down and play this several times in quick succession - some friends we played with seemed to be having trouble with the whole paradox/patch cycle.

A very thematic and funny card game (the characters backstories are specially funny).

The game mechanics do match the theme well (change past events to change the known History), but they also make the game highly caotic, which means its more a game to do some play combos and laugh with the group, than to actually be able to define a strategy to win.

RATING: 4
I think this is a good game, but it has some problems. I think the "artifact/mission" way to win takes attention/focus away from the timeline cards, which is where the interesting part of the game actually is.  I ended up playing solo-nauts a bunch (fun solitaire mode).  For multiplayer, we changed it so it works more like the solitaire mode.  We removed all the artifacts and gadget cards, and each player instead get's three characters they need to 'send home' in any order.  The gameplay is much better when it is all focused around the timeline.

Sleeper hit with my gaming group. Takes a little while to understand just what you are doing in this game (thankfully the draw one play one mechanic is easy enough). Seems to draw a crowd when folks overhear what you are saying when you mess up history. Not bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Game in a Nutshell: Alter cards in a time-line to create your own specific course of history.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Very strong sense of theme with a well imagined layout of events. It's interesting to prevent some major world event then watch the paradoxes ripple across the time-line. The best part of the game is the "what-if" factor of imagining the world should we be able to alter the past.

Cons: Outside of the theme, the game lacks almost to the point of me wanting to say it's broken. It's easy to get the game to a point where you've almost won but need to find one card, and one card only. Now all a player does is flip a card on their turn and discard it if it's not the "one" they wanted. Extremely luck-driven, anti-climactic game play where often the best path to winning is to pass-time discarding a card until you have 10 cards in your hand, thus gaining the victory.

Other: I played this game twice, back-to-back, and it's almost hard to believe I played the correct rules (I haven't read them but trust the explainer). I may play again in the future. Only because the game is short-ish and so I know my impressions aren't unfounded. Am I missing something? Maybe, but I doubt it. 

Best Use: History buffs who will enjoy the theme and don't care if the game-play is completely defunct.

I love the theme, and had high hopes for this game when I got it. But there really is no strategy to this game. You just draw cards until you get enough artifacts in your hand to win, or until you draw the right patches to satisfy your mission. And even when you draw the right cards, your opponent can play that "oh no you don't" card that causes you to waste your card for nothing. It's 95% luck, and 5% knowing how to read. Oh well. I was hoping for more.

Interesting concept.  The mechanics actually do tie to the theme, and with the right group in the right mood the theme itself can be fun.  There is a significant luck factor to the game, but there is still a decent bit of skill in it(especially for players who know all the different goals).  The game plays a little too long to be a filler game in my opinion, and the length is also a little more than I'm comfortable with for a game with as much luck in it as this.  Playing with someone who has taken it upon themselves to destroy reality can be amusing(though with the expansion, they may be doing it for kicks, or they may have that as their goal...)

This is a hilarious game that is short and easy to teach - my family was able to play it after only 2-3 minutes of explanation. Amusingly, I also find that it has taught my cousin a fair amount of history.

The Gore Years expansion for this game is also quite amusing, and I would recommend it. However, it does bother me that the timeline is no longer a nice grid - would it have been that difficult to put in another event?

Dropped my rating from 8 down to 6; I find I'm not as feverish to replay this after a half-dozen tries. Mostly I don't like the Fluxx problem of feeling like there's nothing I can do to improve my chances of winning. Mind you, I like Fluxx because it's light and I don't feel bad when I lose a long game (or even a short game -- they're amusing at least). But Chrononauts tries to be much more than that, and doesn't quite reach.

I really like time travel.  It is a topic that I have great interest in, but it is extremely difficult to do in games.  For simply attempting this,  Chrononauts deserves some credit.  But the execution is just bad.  Games take a long time, and if they don't devolve into flipping back and forth a single event, they are still boring.  You cannot form any sort of strategy, and unless you've played many times and know all the secret goals, your opponents actions are relatively meaningless to you, except where they affect your plans.  I would skip this one.

This game is dreadful.  The only way to get the game to end is to [u]not[/u] play to win, and hope that by some random good fortune someone else does. For example, during this game I had several opportunities to play cards that would change another player's mission or identity cards, or use [i]other[/i] cards to pick these game-breaking cards from the deck and dump them on other players.  If I'd done that, we'd probably still be playing this damn game!

That said, this game does have a really great concept behind it, and there is plenty of humour in the card descriptions and artwork.  Quite a bit of work has gone into reflecting the theme in the game mechanisms.  If you can overlook the tedious gameplay, this aspect might allow you to derive some enjoyment from Chrononauts for the first few plays.

After more plays, I'm not so sure about this game.

I want to like this game much more than I do.  The mechanic of the timeline is fascinating and unusual, and the theme is fun.

RATING: 3
Another silly, random card game that I have no interest in playing. Any game that has cards that force you to trade hands with another player immediately enters my avoid list. The 10-card victory condition is also ridiculous. This game just feels like you're constantly beating your head against a wall and once you've broken through, someone comes along and patches it up right away, forcing you to start the whole painful process over again. Those Labs sure are Looney, but they don't make very good games in this gamer's opinion.

Relatively quick, take-that kind of game, with a clever theme.  Not a game to take seriously, and I since I like history I might be more forgiving towards it than other players, but hey, whenever I feel like messing around with history, this is the game to go to. Have to say though, it is non-attractive in looks.

Update:
Its propensity to be luck-driven and pigeon-holing your strategy depending on your personality card (which sometimes would automatically mean a very slim chance of winning) coupled with its bare-bones look, made it quite dispensable.

I mostly only played this with 2 plp... I think that if you had a group of 4 that this would be even better..

I might play this again, but it would probably be to see how >2 plp plays...

This is a cool game, but it does seem a little random for my liking (i guess thats the point of this game, but you definately need the right crowd)

I bought this game because the theme of time travel appealed to me.  I also liked the fact that it could be played by from 1-6 players, since the only number of players I knew I could count on was one.  Now that I've played it both ways, I have to say that I actually enjoy it more solo.  For one thing, you dispense with the collection of artifacts for solo play.  I also enjoy the sort of planning you have to engage in while playing solo, as to who is returned to their proper era first--very challenging.  Playing with a group is a lot more frustrating, as people are always altering the timeline just when you were finally ready to get somebody out, plus the collection of artifacts as another way to save a character just doesn't make sense, as far as I'm concerned.  If my rating were for solo play, it would be one point higher.  (4+3)  solo plays: 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Playing the solitaire version is a good way to learn how to understand the timeline. I played the full version solo first time, but felt like I got a better handle on game play by playing the solitaire version. The only real drawback to learning the game is one common to all card games in which the rules are printed the same size as the cards. Hence, in "Chrononauts" you have 41 pages of rules, which makes it more difficult to keep everything in mind. Anyway, the solitaire game is very challenging and gives one a lot to think about. I do like how many of the differing events are related to one another in game play. Doesn't grab me in a big way, and maybe I hoped for more than what the game seems to be, but still, for those who like history and can use their imaginations, it can be interesting to play.

Andy Looney has another winner here. The recent "Lost Identities" expansion set of cards are a nice addition to the game. There is also a card in the Looney Labs promotion pack that adds a new Artifact card to the game, "Jade Statue of Tirade". And if you buy any of the Fluxx blank card packs, you get another Artifact card, "Beatles Reunion Album". COOL!

Much, much better with 3 players but it's still a luck-fest with the cards. You only need 3 good cards to win the game (a mission card or two that you need, and some 'get what you need out of the deck' cards to complete your set), but the fun is warping time and the hamming it up that naturally follows. "You mean Lennon didn't die after all?". "Imagine".

Although there is a lot of luck, the game is interesting since it is cool to see how history would change should one event not have occurred. Since all the evens are real, it make it more interesting. The luck is due to the fact that you need to wait for certain cards to achieve your victory conditions. Also, you may have the cards you need, but since you must win at the end of your turn and there are many cards that cause you to pass your hand to other players, you have no control over this and have to hope that you do not lose your card before it gets back to you. Still fun and worth a try.

The rules say to add narrative flavor as you play, because it's sort of a role-playing game.

Chrononauts has mildly amusing flavor text and successfully evokes its theme, but that's about it.

I enjoyed this more than I expected to; I was expecting simply "Fluxx-with-a-theme", but it has enough of a structure to make it different.  It's still very reliant upon luck over skill, but I'm impressed with the clever design.  It's a great concept that's been well thought out.

And above all... it's fun.  A good "start of the evening" filler.

Players are time travellers, with secret identities, secret goals and time travel machines. They spend the game collecting historical items (their goal), trying to alter the timeline in order to get home (their identity), or just patching up the paradoxes that others make. Not bad, tongue in cheek.

I bought Chrononauts on a whim for a two-player card game over a year ago.

I enjoy the challenge, and am a sucker for chaos, and with the right crowd it can be a lot of fun.
I'm changing my rating for this game - its fun, but it does wear thin after a while.  90% of games end with collecting relics, which really draws away from the most interesting mechanism - the timeline. Its a good one to play every now and then, but its days in the limelight are over.  The game deserves credit, though.  I certainly played my money's worth out of it.

When do I play this?:
Rarely, these days.  However, it gets big bonus points for being so damn portable.  I think it's gone with me on all of my trips.  It's good with a buddy or some friends once and a while, but it's tough to teach to strangers and anyone who isn't all that into rules n things.

It has a great thematic implementation. Changing history affects future events and paradoxes can be created. This just suffers from the same problem that Fluxx does in that you can't control your ability to win the game. You can push it in the right direction and hope some people push things in line with your goals, but can't win on your own. Still a fun experience.

I'm giving it a bad review based on what I like in a game.  There is very little player interaction, and it takes to long in changing a time line only to have another player change it back.  The game is like Fluxx in that it is draw one card, play one card, but you have very specific goals that very rarely change.  There is a lot of luck in being able to get your goals, and is super frustrating to see one of your winning goals in front of another player.  I really hated this game.

When I played this game, we used a house rule of, "Whenever you change history, you need to narrate how you did it."  This was fun and hilarious.  We'd usually each end up comming up with different characters.  For instance, my character always changes history because she's so clumsy, or my character's a suave manipulating super-spy.

A decent time travel card game, but Looney Labs quite obviously made it using Fluxx, another of their games, as a template. Consequently, like Fluxx, it ends up feeling very random. But in this case that seems less appropriate.

I recommend ignoring the universal victory conditions and only playing with the character-specific ones.

RATING: 7
Hooray for time travel card games!  I like this game because it has strategy, but it also has luck of the draw.  Since your identity is a secret, occasionally your opponents will win the game for you.  It's very funny when that happens.

This is the game I most frequently play solitaire.  The solonauts version only uses the time-line, patches and inverters, and the point is to get all of a predetermined number of characters back to their home universe.  It's neat especially because in a regular game, the time-line is often the least chosen path to victory.  I get a lot of enjoyment out of the time-line.  

I've also been thinking about doing so research so that I can make an ancient Rome retheme of this game.  It would be so sweet to chronicle change of the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.  So sweet.  Then the characters who try to get home could be modern people or the versions of them that would have resulted if, say, Caligula had stayed in power.  So cool!  

***Update***

I lowered my rating from a nine to a seven because I just don't play play this any more. It's still fun when I play it, but the variety in my collection makes me hanker for Chrononauts much less than I used to.

A nice idea, and I am generally willing to play it as a filler, but I'm a bit worried about the underlying game.

Have tried playing without them (and the artifact-related special cards), with moderate success.

Fun little game - it's a little more chaotic than it may feel at first glance.  Often it's hard to not help your opponents' on your turn, but I guess that's what killing time is for (I'll try to use that more next time I play).  Definitely fun, but I definitely like it more the quicker it plays.  When it comes in close to 30 minutes, it's closer to a seven for me.  When the game moves slower and players are thinking their turn through quite a bit, it's not as attractive.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

Suffers from the same problem as Fluxx, which makes sense because it is basically built on the Fluxx engine. Games can just go on and on with people flipping switches back and forth. 

The theme is fun, but the game as it is has too much take that and lacks an internal timer to keep games tight.

Almost could be a party game, Chrononauts relies on watching your opponents actions as they play cards to determine their hidden-to-the-other-players winning conditions and thrwarting them as you try to do ther same.  There is some strategy as you decide one of three routes to win, but random draws of the cards does make it more fun than brain-strecthing.  A good kids' game as well, since learning history, especially of the 20th century, as well as the effects can be educational.

Played Uber-chrononauts (w/base and expansion)...I couldn't have disliked the game more.  I like the idea of interacting with the timeline to cause ripples, but honestly that part of the game seemed like an afterthought to building up a large hand size and playing "take that" cards...Production value was low as well...Maybe just the base game would have been fun, but this left a bad taste in my mouth.

I love the timeline idea. I've been searching for a time travel game, or a game where you change timelines. Unfortunately, this one didn't work. It had a sense of humor which I liked, a cool timeline mechanic, and then the entire game qas devestated by luck. I had such high hopes... but they were crushed.

RATING: 6
I love the theme of this game, and having the cards laid out in a timeline really serves the theme well. This is fairly easy to teach to new players, and it can be fun to fight over parts of the timeline and see how events might affect other events. This one has lost a little bit of its luster after a lot of plays, because the majority of wins come from artifact collection, which doesn't have the same excitement to me as the timeline. I can see how this is a necessary element though, because fights over the timeline and waiting for patches could make the game take an inordinately long time without another winning condition.

Chrononauts -- Played once; five-player.  While playing, I remarked that it felt like advanced Fluxx.  By which I actually meant that it was as haphazard and insubtantial as Fluxx, while requiring more effort to play.  Only later did I discover that it's from the same publisher.  Sad that the gameplay is so lacking, since I so enjoy the idea of time travel creating ripples which propagate through pertinent history.

[i]Update (years later):[/i]  In re-reading my comments above, it occurs to me that sometimes my headaches make me bitchy.  I wonder if we all would have had more fun with [i]Chrononauts[/i] if I hadn't been so intent on not enjoying myself.

I used to really love this game.  It was easy to lug around and non-gamers could grog this easily.  This was certainly a great tool to use to get non-gamers into more complex games, and without a doubt it remains a clever game.  At the end of the day though, it is pretty random.  I never really want to pull this out to play it, anymore.  

I now feel much more nostalgic about it than actually appreciating it as a game.  Regardless, this game brought a number of my now gaming friends into the fray.  Good Job Chrononauts.

I like the basic premise of playing around with formal logic formulas, even if they are rather basic, and messing with the timeline is a good choice of flavor for it. But the rest of the game is just useless. Essentially you are just fishing the deck for a few key cards that will help you and every now and then someone will play a card that randomly changes your hand or objectives, making the game a total crapshoot.

A fun game with a few problems. The biggest problem is that it's far easier to meet the artifact-collection victory collection than the timeline adjustment victory condition.

It's Fluxx with a time travel theme.  I guess that's not quite fair because I actually like this a little more than Fluxx because I really like games with hidden agendas/secret goals.  In Chrononauts you are given a secret identity and mission, fulfilling either of which will win you the game.  Then the rest of the game plays out a lot like Fluxx.  The humor on the cards is legitimately funny as well.

Saw this at Tactics in Perth and was immediately sucked in by the name. Whatever it was, I wanted to play it. My husband looked up its rating here at BGG while I read out key phrases from the box. Luckily we were on a (too-typical) "Buy it! No regrets!" binge at that moment plus had a special mission to get more two-player-friendly games. I do wish the game was less Ameri-centric (or had more international expansions), but otherwise it suits my tastes quite decently.

RATING: 6.5
Wow.  Points for originality here.  A game that maintains much of the same barely-constrained-chaos feeling of Fluxx, but manages to be structured enough to avoid some of the frustration of the latter.  Well done theme and amusing cards round it out well.  It definitely has its own unique feel.  Winning often seems to happen by accident, because someone unknowingly set the timeline to your history.  The mechanics are pretty simplistic (just draw one play one) but it's always a good laugh of a game, and it doesn't tend to drag too long.  Good filler game for a larger group.

This has a lot of similarities to Fluxx, in fact it feels a lot like Fluxx on steroids.  It's every bit as random and chaotic but it's perhaps a tiny bit more strategic than Fluxx (which isn't saying much) and the flavor text on the cards is amusing.  It's good for a lark.  It earns marks for high portability and easy accessability.  Don't expect to find any real strategy here though.

I know I like chaotic games, but this is just too random. You might draw the cards you need to modify the time line so that you can win, but chances are your opponents will just counter whatever you do anyways.

I suppose then you could just try and complete your set collection mission instead. That means drawing into the same deck of cards and hoping you can get what you need.

You know what playing this feels like? Munchkin. This is a huge pass for me.

At least it's better than Fluxx, unfortunately, that is not saying very much.

A simple luck-based card game that has an interesting time-traveling theme. The Timeline of cards is fascinating, and it's amazing to see how certain events ripple and change other events in the Timeline. Kudos to the theme and humour that literally drips off each card. Aside from that, it's mainly a pure luck-driven, chaotic game where you draw 1 card and play the best card you can. I had more fun reading the cards, really.

Doctor Who? This is a strange--and very unique--game of alternate realities. As a time traveler, you can play time-cop, collect artifacts, or simply (right!) repair time to guarantee your own existence. The game is *tiny* in size, but huge in scope. Many plays will be needed to see if it stands the test of time. (Translation: I don't have a clue, yet, but it is certainly intriguing.)

Probably only a game for the US-born, or very close.

I bought this game mainly because I wanted something I could play alone, with another person, or with a group. Something not very PvP - but not completely separated player interactions.

This game delivers. I played it once alone to learn the mechanics and was immediately hooked. I pitched it to my friends after a long and drawn out game of Small World - and then we continued to play until 2 in the morning. My friends are really picky when it comes to games... I've never been the person to stop playing a game that I owned, but tonight was apparently the night for firsts. Damn you work in the morning!

RATING: 2
Overall, this game is a random race through a card deck to find your unique goal cards.  And don't get too attached to achieving your goal and winning, since someone can use a card to completely replace your goal, which essentially throws your whole game away that point.  This mechanic is so weak and does nothing more to stretch-out what should otherwise be a short, filler game.

Initially the premise for this game sounded promising, but the execution falls very short.

Seems like I hate almost everything that Looney Labs produces.  Fluxx suffers from the same game mechanic problems, and really does not make an enjoyable game. Randomness is a game should help to give variety to a game, and not be the sole mechanic in gameplay.

Chrononauts can provide some pretty funny situations when bizarre things happen to the timeline.  However, I'm not a fan of the gameplay.  It's just a bit too wacky.  You can have your goals or your hand of cards taken from you at any time.  My rating would go up if this was a filler-length game, but it can go anywhere from five minutes to an hour, which is definitely too long.

Entertaining but somewhat chaotic time travel game. I epecially like the theme.

As Yogi Berra once said, "The future ain't what it used to be".

Contrary to it's theme,  you will soon discover, that in actuality,  there is no future in this game.  This one nearly leaves me at a loss for words.....nearly.

Be prepared for the haunting dirges that will most assuredly accompany the experience of playing this frightening mess.

Concerning the theme, some say it's unique,  I say it is only unique in the fact that it qualifies as both awful and offal,  at the same time.  

Others say it's history.  As far as that sentiment goes,  I can only concur,  as I gleefully exclaimed that very thing.......upon my completion of trading it.

RATING: 3
The theme is fantastic.  I was hoping for a high screwage/interactive game.  I was wrong.  The problem is built into the system.  The game needs to force cards out of players hands, yet the players have little to no knowledge which cards they should be holding.  Plus, there are very few "legal" plays so the hand management seems quite forced.  Little control, little interaction, but great theme = 3.    I wish someone would play the patch on "Thnikkaman plays chrononauts" so it would have never happened.

There's a lot of luck-of-the-draw in this card game, but you have to come into it knowing that it's made by the creators of Fluxx. The theme is well-executed and there is definitely fun to be had.

In Chrononauts, each player becomes a time traveler, with a unique identity and a secret mission. During the game, players travel backwards and forwards through history, doing all those things people have always dreamed of using a time machine to do: Visiting the great moments of the past, peeking into the future, collecting up impossible artifacts and priceless works of art (at the moment just before history records their destruction), coming to grips with the paradoxes of time travel, and of course, changing pivotal events and altering the course of history itself. How would the timeline be different if Lincoln and JFK had not been assassinated? And is that the version of reality that you came from originally... the one you must return to in order to win? It's all packed into a fast and easy Fluxx-style card game that will take you to the beginning of time and back again.

I like balancing the different victory conditions.  Like Fluxx, however, it is difficult to have a real strategy.  You just play until you get the right cards.  I loved it when I first got it (as I did Fluxx), but now that I've played much better games, it has only a dim glow as one of the early games in my renewed passion for games.

RATING: 4.5
Good:
-Historical
-Some humor
-Chain reactions
-Anyone can win

Bad:
-Never clear who is in the lead
-Random and abrupt end
-Encourages strategy but luck dominates

Overall:
You're opinion of Chrononauts depends on your opinion of Fluxx.  If your a big fan, you will probably like this game and may like it more (I do).  As with Flux, there are better games out there.  If you want a luck driven card game with some take that cards and humor, play Guillotine.  At least in Guillotine the objective, leader, and end is always clear.

We are big fans of "The Best of Chronology" (where you build a time-line in a trivia-style game). Chrononauts' central playing surface (the timeline built of cards) was what caught our attention. 

Fluxx with a timeline (a board to give it more focus) and without significant changes to the core instructions ("Draw 1, Play 1" is the rule throughout the game). You still have items to collect in front of you, action cards to let you do things outside the rules, and some zanyness - but it's reigned in from Fluxx and focused on the time-manipulating game. 

The point is to either collect 3 artifacts (very FLUXX-like) as specified on your secret mission card, or to adjust 3 timeline headlines to specific conditions as listed on your Identity card. Linchpin cards (about half of the timeline) are the ONLY cards the players can adjust (causing the historical event not to have occured, or restoring history if already altered) but these affect other big events. For example, if Adolph Hitler was assasinated at the Berlin Olympics, the Holocaust doesn't happen along with several other events. If both Adolph Hitler and Pearl Harbor are prevented, there's no WWII. You get the idea. 

Just like FLUXX, you can be drawing a bead on winning the game and one of your opponents will reverse history or steal your card. So victory is elusive, often sudden, and probably not won by the person you assumed would win. Fun!

Chrononauts is built around a very cool concept, a group of time travelers racing to change earth's timeline to a specific course of events. Some travelers want to see John Lennon survive assassination and become a senator, others want the Cuban Missile Crisis to spiral down into World War III. Each player, of course, is working toward a different timeline. Players may also pursue a more roguish path to victory and travel through time stealing artifacts, such as the video tape of the creation of the universe (on Betamax) or The Crown of Thorns (worn by you know who).
 
Gameplay is fast and fluid. It's basically draw a card, play a card. There are plenty of screw your neighbor cards, so player interaction is good and down time is minimal. There is however, a very large element of luck involved. Barring a complete memorization of the Time traveller IDs and mission cards, it is very difficult to play defensively. Missions and personal timelines are kept secret, and often the game is decided when one player inadvertently resets the timeline to another player's goal. Secret mission cards are also much easier to complete than timeline goals, and the vast majority of wins come via stealing artifacts rather than altering timelines. While this does detract a bit from the theme the game promises, I suppose it prevents games from running on endlessly.

Despite the sheer randomness of it all, Chrononauts is more fun than the sum of it's parts. Nothing here is really amazing play wise, but it is still a great concept for a game...which at the very least will stir up discussions at the table about what might have happened had things gone differently throughout history. It doesn't matter if we are debating the merits of assassinating Hitler or just squabbling over which of us owns the "real" Mona Lisa, we always have a great time whenever we play. A classic overachiever.

Played only once. I might have missed something, but what I remember is a terribly long game during which I and another player were fighting to complete opposite goals. Of course we both failed - and at last someone else managed to end the game after some (long) time.

Random, but in a good way.  Very much not a serious game.

I pull this out regularly and play it when I can.  It needs more events for repeated play.  If only they'd come up with world events rather than just from a western viewpoint.

I like this much more than flux, the ramshackle play seems to have a point, and the theme is very tasty

I am a huge fan of thought experiments and such. The fact that you can change the past in this game is pretty awesome. There's also an interesting RPG element where you can create stories of how you changed the past. Great stuff.

I do enjoy the changing of history. Not much skill involved but it's awesome to see how the game plays out and history changes.

Entertaining education. Chrononauts, from the makers of Fluxx, sets you in the shoes of a time traveler, or "Chrononaut." You achieve victory by returning to your proper timeline, completing your mission (A.K.A. assembling the proper artifacts from all over time), or patching enough paradoxes. This intuitive card game can find a way into any gamer or history-lover's heart.

RATING: N/A
Tough to grok.  Not sure why.  Extremely random w/take that elements that came out of nowhere solely just to screw w/the other player.  I think that's the issue I have w/it but then again its by the same designer as Fluxx so I suppose that is to be expected.

Easy to learn, fun to play, and very portable. Best with three or four while still being playable with two, the mechanics felt tight and balanced.  A hefty dose of silliness makes this an easy 8.

It's kind of like fluxx with  a purpose.  OR maybe a less chaotic fluxx.  Made by the same company it has a similar style of play.  Draw a card, and play a card, use the cards to change the situation.  But the game is much more stable than fluxx.  Having three different methods to win, and a way for everybody to loose is a nice touch.

This game is great. Fantastic concept, quick play, easy to learn and teach. Only drawback: relies a bit too much on luck of the draw, but deck-search cards help you to control your own fate. It screams for an alternate version with varying timelines and nation's histories.

I give the solitaire version "Solonauts" a 10.  I really love playing it.  I rate the full game as a 7, perhaps 8.  Averaged together, that gives 8.5

Overwrought card game that outstayed it's welcome. Mercifully, the game I played finished earlier than it can do. I have no interest in playing this again.

RATING: 5
This distills the complexities of time travel into card game form about as good as its going to get, although it's like FLUXX in that it's almost impossible to plan a strategy to win. But also like FLUXX, part of the fun is simply playing it, and the interaction with the other players. And that Time Vortex card RULES for players who love to be hated by everyone else.

This game has great mechanics, a wonderful theme, and a sense of humor. Unfortunately, it's also as random as Fluxx (by the same company). The main mechanic of the game (creating paradoxes and then patching them) is worse than useless because it might help someone else win.

Playing this kind of felt like playing Fluxx with some long term planning options.  A better game in my opinion but potentially more confusing, particularly with larger numbers of players.

A great filler that is always fun. I wish there was a little more variety in patches available for each paradox, but I am very pleased with the ease of play and humor in the game.

Novel notions — I'd change a few cards to reduce their devastating, Fluxx-like effect, but certainly enjoyable nonetheless.

Can be a bear of a game, with the timeline constantly tugging back and forth. With three win conditions, you'd think that wins would come quickly, but they really don't.

VERY fun game in such a simple and small box. Mild learning curve that is easily overcome by most players.

Game rules advise you to win via shaping the time-line, while your real focus should be completing your mission. Minor gripe but doesn't change the fact this is a good game.

RATING: 8
Wonderful humorous "change time line"-game. Play cards from your hand on the timeline to upset history and patch it with an alternative future. The guy who has patched it according to his "identity" wins. As you can't control the game enough, it's rather random, but enjoyable all the way through. I mean, assassinate Hitler IS fun.

Kurzweiliges Zeitreise-Kartenspiel mit innovatimen Konzept und viel Humor, das mir ziemlichen Spaß macht. Man kann zwar wenig planen und verliert schon mal sehr überraschend, aber das gehört bei Zeitreisen dazu. Eines der wenigen Spiele, denen ich den hohen Glücksfaktor verzeihen kann, weil es mir ansonsten so gut gefällt.

Pros: Quick and low number of players are required.

Average, but a well designed addition to the werewolf series.

Woah, I don’t think that there is any game to be found here… There simply isn’t enough information to base your deduction on, and it seemed as if the one who yelled the loudest would win as there is no valid reason to actually believe what any of the players claim. 

In each of my 3 plays, which by the way were with what I suppose are the optimal number of players, 5 and 7 (as opposed to for instance 3 which I think would be awful), it was impossible to deduce anything. Of course the body language and voice can reveal something, but you cannot really deduce anything. My rating of 3 reflects my opinion; I am probably not going to play it again, although I could be convinced to play it once or so between games if the other players insisted, simply because it’s so short. However, a couple of weeks after I played ONW I was introduced to the “upgraded”/”advanced” version, One Night Ultimate Werewolf. I have to say that ONUW is a huge improvement over the original one, and I think there is much more room for deducing who is who because of the plethora of roles with special powers. Also, it probably helped that we took longer to decide and actually discuss why people said so etc. So to sum up I will probably never play ONW again as ONUW has replaced it.

So simple and so pure a way to play Werewolf with 3-6p.  I've only played it at 4 and 6, but I LOVED the game at those counts.  Need to try 3 and 5 still.

Update: have played it at 5, and it's great there too.  Each game is so different from the last!

Update: It also works at three! Very tricky for villagers even at that player count assuming veteran wolves.

Update: I have on pre-order 3 copies, will probably use at least one as trade fodder.

When I heard about this game i was so excited to try it out. The concept of hidden roles and accusing others sound just fun. Then i played it and was disappointed. maybe it was because of the game group but i think this game is no fun at all. Spyfall did all this but much better.

Es... curioso! Y total, se juega con 7 cartas xD (Prohibido jugar con 6, opino que no funciona).
Si durante lo que dura la partida (4 minutos) consigues reírte, creo que ya se ha amortizado la partida.
Y lo mismo que con el coup, me encanta que con tan pocos componentes se pueda hacer un juego que tenga algo de chicha.

A five minute social deduction game that allows for some actual, not totally random deduction to happen.  It can have some laugh out loud moments and is over so quickly if you really muck it up as a werewolf you'd have to work pretty hard to dwell on it.

We loved One Night Werewolf! I played regular Werewolf once, but after playing this, I don't think I'll go back to it. The ideal number, we found, was 8 players - the Minion role was just enough poison in the water to make the 5 minutes fruitful with theories and accusations. We used the app that hosts the game for you and it's invaluable. An easy buy if you have big groups over!

Not my cup of tea. It's far more a gimmick than a game. Not enough roles and information in the game to introduce valid reasons to pick the werewolves. When the sorcerer or thief act they have to move their hand to the pieces which can give their role away to other players who listen carefully. On top of all that, there is pixel art which I find very ugly. Just take (a little more) time to play the resistance or normal werewolves, both are far superior and much much more fun.

very quick werewolf game that is just perfect as a filler with 3 to 7 players.

easy to explain.

Probably should be played in loud places (or make noise yourself) as you can otherwise hear people take actions during the nigh phase.

Only 7 tiles an easy rule set yet an enjoyable game.

A quick version of Werewolf without player elimination. It attempts to do one job, and does it very well: being a social deduction quick filler for up to 7 players. Because of the special roles' powers, there's enough bluffing and debating to prevent it from becoming bland. I enjoy it.

Bizarre short werewolf variant. I like the cool looking (8bit style) & sturdy tiles and the miniature size. We played it with 3, had fun, but suspected it might be broken at that player amount. Probably best played with at least 4, I guess it's best with 5 or 6.

It's over before it outstays it's welcome, so I guess it's a nice inbetweenie or pub game. (A noisy background would be better than a silent room)

If for nothing else the fince illustations and the thick cardboard supporting the characters.  Minimalistic werewolf style game works for few people, at least for a couple games.  After about two or three plays, though, did not really work any more for a three player crowd.  Maybe better with a few more.  Not a werewolf fan, bit this was pretty fun late at night with whisky on the side.

A 5-10 minute werewolf variant micro-game for 3-6 players. Only played twice both with 6 players and with a standard deck of cards as I couldn't get a copy but it's a serious contender to replace Love Letter and Coup. I'm not making that claim yet but the potential is there especially if you're a fan of Werewolf and The Resistance. It plays just like them but faster and with fewer players. With only two special roles the bluffing possibilities are limited but there is more to it than is immediately obvious. The lack of player elimination during the game ensures that everyone is engaged until the end. Overall I was very impressed with the basic design and hope to play more soon.

There are three negatives I can think of. The biggest by far is the number of roles available. There REALLY need to be more to give it enough variance to keep people coming back after the 10th or 20th time around. 
The second is making noise/timed phases can be a little annoying to run through but this is a minor complaint. 
The third is availability but I hear rumours that a publisher has picked this up. I expect they will do very will with it.



Quick and Dirty Game Summary
Deal 1 role to each of n players. Roles are Seer, Thief, 2x Werewolf, n-2 villagers. 2 cards will be left over these are placed in the center of the playing area face down.
Each player checks their role (this is the only time they can look at their card)
All players close their eyes.
In timed 5-10 second segments each special role takes their action. (players make noise on the table to conceal who is acting in each role)
Seer goes first and looks at another players role or the two roles in the middle.
Werewolf/ves next open their eyes to identify if they have a partner.
Thief last, switches role with another player (and checks his new role).
All players open their eyes and attempt to bluff and deduce who the werewolves are. After about 5 minutes all players vote by simultaneous pointing.
The player(s) with the highest votes are lynched. 

Winning Conditions
If at least one werewolf is in play and
-a werewolf is lynched, then the villagers win.
-a werewolf is not lynched, then the werewolves win.
If no werewolf is in play and a villager is lynched then everyone loses. This can be avoided by all players getting a single vote in which case no one is lynched.

This is a slightly unfair rating as we got a fairly crucial rule wrong (and were unclear on at least one more) but I'm really just a bit bored of deduction games right now. This, thankfully, is very fast but there's no actual scope for deduction. You just argue for 5 minutes and then vote.

RATING: 5
[thing=142503][/thing] works, mostly, like the regular [thing=925][/thing], with one clear difference: everything happens in a single night.

Some of the roles present in the games are still the same: the Werewolves (they don't kill anyone, however, but the village still wants to find them), the Sorcerer (can look at someone else role, or look two of the ones out the game) and the Villagers (who want to find the werewolves). But, more important, there is a new role: the Phantom Thief, that may trade his role with that of someone else, but he can't look what he now became.

This role is designed to insert a level of uncertainty into the whole situation, and, if that wasn't enough, there are always three roles that stay "out" of the game, in the center of the table, so players don't know exactly what is in the game and what isn't.

Therefore, you might have started the game as a Werewolf, but, after the Phantom Robber changing roles, you became the Phantom, so, during the day, you will act as a Werewolf, trying to not beign caught and maybe defending your fellow Werewolf, only to discover, in the reveal of the roles, that if you succeeded, you actually lost with the rest of the village!

Basically, the game doesn't allow for certainty.

The goal of the village is to find one of the Werewolves, and of the Werewolves is to make the village pick anyone else. It doesn't get simpler than this.

If I had any doubt that this shortened version of [thing=925][/thing] would work, they were mostly left behind. [thing=142503][/thing] is fun, fast and loud. It can generates a good time, with wild discussions and accusations. However, [thing=142503][/thing] leaves little clues for the players, so it is indeed most in the talk that player can win or lose. Because of this, the game do requires people with social skills to play, players that aren't shy to yell, lie, roleplay. These aren't the easiest things to find around in people - I played one game in which one of the Werewolf stayed completely quiet during the whole discussion, when I (the other werewolf) was being accused by the player claiming to be the Sorcerer. It was just left there alone - we both lost and it was frustrating to me.

While [thing=142503][/thing] is an easy game to teach, to learn and play, it isn't for everyone - it fits for those that like social deduction games and are very talkative, and these are harder to find that one could expect.

Anyway, [thing=142503][/thing] was left in the dust by the release of [thing=147949][/thing], which is a much superior game, with many more roles, more chaos, fun and game inside the box.

I like Werewolves and played it a lot, but I dislike the fact that the players who are eliminated early on have nothing to do but wait. I was hoping that One Night Werewolf would provide a similar experience, but in a shorter timespan. Unfortunately, the game fell completely flat because there isn't any information on other players other then what player volunteer.

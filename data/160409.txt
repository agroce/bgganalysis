RATING: 7.5
Let's say you have 4 middle-aged guys who just happen to sitting around a bar and enjoying the fine brews on tap and they think to themselves... what should [i]we[/i] play?  Well... the correct answer is Too Many Cinderellas.  This a extremely entertaining yet thinking man's game.  Is it light?  Absolutely.  Is it fun?  Absolutely.  This is the kind of game you should always have on hand for those bar nights when sitting and drinking isn't going to cut it (and lets be real - when does it ever?)  So why not brave the odd looks and have a little bit of fun?  The votes are in... and not a single No! to be seen.  Yeah, that's how it is.

Turns out I'm not a fan of playing filler games unless it's at the start of a session or in-between games at a multi-table session while we're waiting for the other group to finish.  As such, I don't need a lot of them in my collection.  Pick the best 5 or so and be done with it, says I.  This is NOT in the "Top 5".

Initial Impressions
---------------------

Interesting take on that Tobago like mechanism of narrowing down on a specific "thing".  Really short, but only getting 4 cards really didn't offer many choices.  At least in my case, it was pretty obvious which way I had to play my cards.  Would play again, but not something that was all that interesting.

RATING: 8.5
The mechanics of this game are quite unique to me. It's a good game of forcing players to decide who Cinderella is NOT, and then trying to hold onto a card that is still the best Cinderella available! You get one veto, so use it wisely! I'll play this anytime someone wants to...good game!

RATING: 5
A quick, silly game of trying to narrow down the characteristics of the real Cinderella, in order to match a Cinderella card from your hand more accurately than the cards in opponents' hands.

Each player also has one veto chip that allows you to negate one card played by an opponent per game.  So, for example, if all your cards are of people wearing glasses, and someone says that Cinderella doesn't wear glasses, you can cancel that card.  However, you can only do it once per game, so use it wisely!

This is a pretty random game.  Basically the whole group wants one of their princesses (or princes) to be the correct one.  However, each card has a standard that fulfills who the last one will be.  As you play these cards your hand gets more and more limited until you have the last card in hand which, hopefully, will fall under all the qualifications played by every player in the group.

RATING: 6
This microgame felt promising to me. Narrow down the choices of suitors by carefully eliminating ones that you don't have. But you only get to vote down one "rumor" - if you choose poorly you might not be the only one voting no, so your vote is essentially wasted.

I appreciate the concept, but it just felt like a less interesting version of Love Letter. I'm unsure yet if it will stick around, but it was nice to give it a try and I love the small box.

Great quick filler, especially among those who aren't necessarily gamers -- anyone can pick it up after one game and it lasts less than 10 minutes. Yes there's luck. Yes, someone could memorize all the cards and characteristics and over-strategize to win, but your brain shouldn't be operating at that high of a level for this one.  It's just fun.

It's like Love Letter and Guess Who had a baby.   There is something a little bit wrong with it thematically, and that adds a lot of comedy to the game, which is a really nice touch.   It appears that the republished version is going to change the artwork, and that's quite unfortunate.  One of the better microgames I've played.

RATING: 7
'Too Many Cinderellas' is a micro deduction game where players set rules for whom will not be Cinderella, trying to structure it so that they hold the best candidate at game end.

Each player also has one veto, so there is some social interaction as to who will use their veto on any given card.

Extremely fast in gameplay, this is an amusing little social game, and the minimal artwork of the Japanese import version definitely appealed to me.

A short game of creating deductions so to speak...where you are trying to make one of your final two cards the actual Cinderella.  I think this would be best if played several rounds where the first to win 2-3x would be the actual winner so there might be a chance of a bit of metagame as well.

A cute and entertaining micro game. Gives me a similar feel to Council of Verona, but instead of hidden scoring, everyone is giving clues about who Cinderella could possibly be. My one complaint about this game is that I wish that the Yes and No Chips were all the same color. Once you know someone has spent their No Chip, you know they're usually powerless to stop what you play. This game is fine. It makes for a good family game, but I don't know that I'd play it over other micro games like Lost Legacy and Cypher.

It's a game of hope. Hoping that one of the two rules you play will knock out a bunch of cinderella cards that other players are holding, and hoping that cards that others play won't knock out yours. Because you can only knock out one card by yourself. By the time everyone's played their two knockout rules, determine who's got the best card left in their hand that hasn't been knocked out. There's not much more to it, being a micro-game that's palatable but doesn't provide a lot of the way in interesting or thoughtful decisions. The simultaneous resolution to see if multiple people have knocked something out can generate some laughs at least. The game improved over multiple rounds after you gained more knowledge of the cards and what you were knocking out. But that's probably a bell curve as well, with over-familiarity probably leading to been-there-done-that before long. Still, it's friendly and passable and places well in the genre.

RATING: 7
"Clever microgame with Tobago-style 'reverse deduction'. The game seems really chaotic and uncontrollable at first, but you can definitely get better at it. It's quick (about 10 minutes per round), and fun, at least with 4p."

What I like:
- Innovative theme and gameplay
- Small box, quick play time (10 min per round)
- Requires more skill than it seems at first

What I don't like:
- I'm bummed that the theme is that you're deceiving the prince
- Voting over and over can feel a bit repetitive
- The brown and black hair colors are too similar

I would put the weight around 1.5, slightly higher than BGG voters.

Rated as a kids game.

The game is a bit random, but it creates an illusion of control.  There are choices, but there is not much information to base them on (except when the best choice is obvious).  But it flows well and is very short.

More importantly, for this type of game, the cards are pretty funny and have good references to the fairy tale.  The prince might (but likely won't) end up marring a senior man or a poorly disguised cat.

RATING: 5.5
Too Many Cinderellas is a microgame with a [thing=42215][/thing]-esque method of eliminating potential characteristics of the most viable candidate to marry Prince Charming. Apart from playing extremely quick and being packaged in a pocket-sized box (for the Japanese version at least), the other selling point is its quirky strain of humour as the princesses-in-waiting include a doddering senior citizen, a cat and a cross-dresser.

However, a big chunk of the game is determined by your opening hand, which pretty much dictates which cards to play down. It's possible to have a hand of conflicting rumours, or have every card in hand ruled out due to a succession of unfavourable rumours. The 4P game is marginally better because more cards are used and there is a semblance of control. This is a decent distraction if you have 5 minutes to spare, but unfortunately nothing more than that.

This is a very light little micro game! It's sort of like [thing=915]Mystery of the Abbey[/thing] or [thing=42215]Tobago[/thing] or [thing=35488]The Name of the Rose[/thing], condensed to their core essence and with a cute theme (although I'm not crazy about the artwork!). There is a fair bit of randomness -- I'm not sure how much control you really have with just 4 cards in hand, plus the random reveal at the end -- but it certainly felt like we were still making some decisions about our card plays! Anyway, that level of randomness is perfectly fine in a 10-minute game! 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Everyone is dealt 4 cards -- different possible Cinderellas numbered 1-18 -- and tries to play cards to the center eliminating characteristics that don't match. The Cinderallas are generally girls that are young/teen/adult/old, blonde/brunette/redheaded, prefer wine/beer, etc. But there is also at least one male candidate, and a cat! 

On your turn, add a card to the display to use it's power: these generally just exclude a certain characteristic, but sometimes they modify the rules, move NO votes, etc. Then everyone uses their yes/no chips to simultaneously vote on that card. But you only have ONE veto (no vote), so you better use yours carefully!

After everyone is down to 2 cards, one of the undealt cards is revealed and added to the display of rules. Players with candidates that fit all the rules reveal one: the LOWEST numbered one (unless one of the rules reversed priority) wins. If no one matches perfectly, lowest number wins?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game reminds me a lot of Love Letter.  It is a "micro" card game that is mostly pretty random with some small bit of mitigation and choice.

This game probably has a little more control than Love Letter.  In this game players are dealt 4 cards each.  2 of those cards will be played for the effect of narrowing down a possible Cinderella.  Things like "Cinderella is not blonde" or "Cinderella does not wear glasses".  The other 2 cards are used at the end to determine who Cinderella is by matching the woman (or man) on the card with the criteria.  Also like Love Letter if multiple cards match the winner is based on card ranking.

The little bit of mitigation comes in that each player essentially gets one veto on criteria so if one comes out that torpedoes your whole hand such as "Cinderella is not blonde" when you have 4 blondes in your hand you can cancel out that criteria.

In the end I still like Love Letter better.  This game should be better because it has a little bit more control but Love Letter has this unexplainable charm.  I need to play this more and at less than 5 minutes a hand I'm sure I will have the chance and maybe something will be there I didn't originally see.

Light fun filler - a bit too much luck, but so short it feels fine.  

My personal goal is to get the cat to win.  It hasn't happened yet in our games.  Almost!  We had both the "Not a wine drinker" and "Not a beer drinker" witness unvetoed!  But the last card was a "Well, if I can't win, you can't either" play: "Not 16, 17, or 18."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Players have a hand of four multi-use cards reflecting individuals with various characteristics (e.g. age, gender, food preference, hair colour). Two will get played face up as a "rumour", usually eliminating one category ("Cinderella is not a teenager"), unless a player uses their one veto to stop it. At the end of the game, the best candidate not eliminated by any rumour wins.

It's a cute filler that's worth a few plays primarily for the entertainment value in discovering that Cinderella is actually a tranvestite man or a cat. There isn't much game there but it's mildly amusing fluff.

Not a fan of either the artwork or Grail Games' stupid new box size.

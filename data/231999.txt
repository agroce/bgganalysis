TRADED IT! (for Staufer Dynasty)

This is a weirdly created solitaire game. It is modeled after the classic standard card Solitaire game where you run through the deck multiple times in an attempt to sort the cards by value and suit (here just by value), but Finished! adds "effects" one would find in a modern Euro game. The finished product is just clunky and tedious to play (so the work theme is very alive here).

I really respect Friese's passion for reinventing what a game is and can be, but with trial comes inevitable error, and this was the latter by far.

This solitaire card game created by the green mad scientist Friedmann Friesse is slowly growing in me.
Certainly was hate at first sight. Sluggish, indecipherable actions on each card, lack of achievement... but at the end of my first play I was hooked. At that point I still was unable to understand what I was doing but I saw the potential of the game actions, I saw the entanglement in my mind and still I wanted to play it again and again.

I’m not sure how long the hook will work, but at the moment I just beat once the super easy level.

RATING: 6
Rating after my first play: I have just finished my first trip of what seems to be a journey along the curly brains of the author, and find myself barely having scratched the pleasure and meaning of this solo game. In plain words, intrigued and eager to play again, but uncertain if the rating will go up or down.

RATING: 6
Very much a puzzle sort of game, similar to Friday, but not nearly as thematic.  Plays quicker.  I expect this will be a game that I play enough to get my money's worth, then hide it for a few years, and have fun all over again once I've forgotten how to play.

WARNING: Although the rules and glossary do not say so, if a purple card is activated to place 00:48 under the deck, YOU STILL SPEND A CUP OF COFFEE!  After 4 games, I was finding the game a but easy.  That would be why.

RATING: 8
There's something almost zen about this game. Like, I know I'm essentially replicating a job, but I become hyperfocused when I play and zone everything else out. Game length has been around an hour for me, which is surprising. But it's a pretty engaging hour. A fun, puzzly solitaire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.9
Comparison to Friday:
1) Fewer rules to keep track of.
2) Not quite, but nearly, as hard to win.
3) Quicker set up, less card sorting.
4) Slightly less replay value.

RATING: 7
I never used to be one for solo gaming but have more recently started to play a few solo games so I decided to grab this one as a quick option. Turns out it's not all that quick but it is an interesting little puzzle. Luck of the draw can definitely play a part but it's cool to see yourself making progress as the game goes on.

RATING: 8
As a follow-up to Friese's Friday, this seemed to be comparatively somewhat lackluster at first. However, with more plays, this little game won me over with what makes it special. At its heart, the game is a bubble sort: but the special powers, the limited resources, and small micro-rewards for getting cards into sequence give this game a lot of charm. The theme even feels right: the game is highly mechanical, tedious, and repetitive; just like a day at a desk job. Finished! does not try to pass as something that it is not; these days, that is immensely refreshing. A great sophomore solo effort that is mindfully pleasant. 

Recommended for anyone who is looking for a contemporary patience solitaire game.

It feels like sorting files. Yes, I know that's the point. I am just not sure I am cut out for this kind of solitaire game. The design is well done, the actions (some of which seem pointless when you first play) make sense and can be used to your advantage. But it was long and oh so silent, and I like laughing when I play games.

Interesting game from Friedemann Friese. You go through motions trying to sort this big stack piece by piece trying to create small combos that you will draw together. While doing these you also search for the next card to score while trying to avoid the last card by pushing it to the deck or the future. Quite brilliant ideas put together. What a great puzzle game.

Enjoyable solitaire game. I find I'm more willing to break this out than Friday, as it involves a little less setup and upkeep.

RATING: 5
Not as elegant, distinctive, thrilling and intuitive as Friday. To be more successful (and ignore the luck factor) you have to count cards and memorize as much as possible. So more than a puzzle and a real brain fight. Everything that makes Friday such an outstanding solo game is missing here. But: it is still a veeeeery smart designed solitaire patience game. So if you like this kind of challenge, you could possible love this one here.

Pros:
+ Represents women in software
+ An engaging game with a small rulebook and glossary.
+ Quick and puzzly gameplay.
+ Price point good.

Nice Touches:
+ The flipbook

Cons:
- Once you figure out some future manipulation tricks, the game becomes too easy.
- Difficulty modes purely reducing the amount of resources at your disposal (not innovative)

This is Klondike for gamers. If you like killing some time playing a solo card game, but you like turning your brain on while playing, this is a very good option.
I have now “Finished” the game twice at the easiest level, the second time with one cup of coffee left, and have started the next level (got close, but no win yet).
Since there are four levels of difficulty in this game, I am definitly not “Finished” with this game. I don’t see any reason as to why I wouldn’t get 50 plays out of this (as I did with Friday).

The game is just not exciting. It feels like work (so thematically it's good ;) ). The game mechanic is interesting, but it's very fiddly with all the cards moving around; prone to mistakes as well. Remembering where all cards are is a big factor as well, not my favorite activity. On top of that the goal of the game and the way to get there is very straight forward: once you've played it, it's just a matter of optimizing, no other strategies to try out. Plus it takes way longer than 30 minutes like stated on the box. I prefer Friday over this game any time!

RATING: 7.6
This game seems really hard to win or even come close even on the easy level.  Things some times just have to line up and you have to push your luck at the right time.  Seems like a heavy memory game.  Plays a lot long that 30-45 minutes.  More like 1 to 1 and a half hours and theme-less.  However, it it entertaining when in the mood for a longer solo game that is fast to set up and put away.

RATING: 8.5
Played through once so far. I enjoyed the puzzle, although I did find that after a couple of cycles through the deck everything would be sorted in groups, but could be far away from each other, so it could take some major risk taking of breaking up a pre-sorted chunk in order to get more cards in play to try to close that gap, and when it often blew up in my face I got pretty burned by it.

I also found myself wishing there was an action I could take to generate a candy but was otherwise unproductive, as there was sometimes several rounds in a row where I just drew cards, sorted those three, and put them in the past, activating nothing, just waiting for the next card with a candy on it to show up.

Also the game plays pretty long. It does ramp up the more times you cycle through, but this game can still take an hour to play.

That being said, it's still a fascinating. I like how you can put things off into different time periods, have to push your luck sometimes, and try to combo things off each other. This may become one of my goto solo games.

Sorting cards with some powers. It feels like traditional solitaire with powers on the cards. It’s about equally rewarding.

RATING: 5
It really is an okay game, and I like the idea of sorting. After many plays I feel less and less likely to play. It's more convenient than anything else. A little long for what it is, but a fairly clever design. 

Not sure if it's even possible to win certain hands due to the shuffle, but I could be wrong. My rating certainly reflects the 'take it or leave it' for me. I'd much rather play Friday, Coffee Roaster than this, let alone bigger games.

A good idea with ok components (even though they seem nice enough).Overly simplistic for the year it came out, you don’t necessarily feel neither the pirate theme (at least judging by the first scenario played) nor really any substantial pressure from the real-time nature of the game. One worker, few options to make each game, simplistic at best for my game group.

Demoed at Essen 2017. I like the idea of hourglass worker placement with real time game. It adds the nice pace to the game and makes it dynamic. or it should have. I didn't really feel that it this game. At least not in the demo game we played. And if I remember correctly we played 3rd scenario on highest difficulty level. It wasn't bad. There is some challenge and you have to plan ahead. The 3D ship model is great and it's not just a decoration. Everything you do you do on it. Reload cannons requires you to put ammo on the right spot. There is a place for every worker. The sail has to be lowered or raised to increase/decrease speed/ability to maneuver. So it works fine and I had fun playing it. I just didn't feel the rush I think I was meant to. When all of us put our workers we just waited for the sand in hourglass to run out doing nothing. So after the rush to put each worker in correct spot there was a downtime waiting for them to do their actions. Nevertheless I like this game for a filler it is :)

A nice realtime adventure game with sandglasses as action tokens. 10 different chapters adding extra options. The components look great on the tavle, the game is entertaining.

Ok, co-op real-time game. Only played as two-player game. I think it would be less interesting to play it with more players, since each player would then have less workers (time glasses) to handle. There isn't that many decisions to make to begin with. Also, a lot of the tokens are small, which makes it a bit fiddly. Not good in a real-time game. The scenario difficulty can be very random due to which order the hidden scenario "objective" cards are flipped up. Especially if the scenario is about doing specific things in a specific order.

The app is well done, except that some effects that are forced upon you by the app during a scenario aren't announced distinctly enough. Sometimes you just glance at the app and realize that you have to turn the ship clockwise because of a "tidal wave" (or something to that effect), but you are not sure when that notification showed up on the screen. A more pronounced way of notifying these kind of events would be nice. The rules for components that get revealed throughout the campaign are only available in the app and are only accessible on the scenario setup screen, not when actually playing the scenario. Three difficulty settings ensures that you can adapt the game to different types of players.

It's a fun game, but not a keeper. Probably good as a realtime game you can play with kids.

Had a chance to play. Take the pressure of Magic Maze and apply it in a fact that your people are timers and have to wait until their timer runs out to make the next action. Trying to find the route to escape becomes a challenge while being on a timer and potentially ships shooting at you.

This was a very fun and unique game. I really enjoyed the mechanics of the sand timer player pieces and the use of the app.

Tired pirate theme? Real-time? App-dependent? Cooperative? Sandtimers? Just punch me in the nuts and be done with it, please.

Co-op real time game where your worker is the timer, and you have to control the boat and exploring the passageways and fight the other pirates. Lots to do with and integrated app to use. Not bad but not really my thing either.

I have just played the first 4 chapters with my family, who are not heavy gamers but like occasionally to play not too hard ones. They all love the way the game work: the simultaneous  gameplay combined with not too many options and the sand-timer meeples are really a good implementation, but with the app as a companion it is just gorgeous. Also we all like the history driven by the game chapter after chapter and the legacy style of discovering new game components and mechanics. 
I can recommend about the game this:  you just NEED to try it at least once and you are going to love it!

Cooperative game controlled with a phone app. Players use sand timers to do their actions and roll die when shooting with cannon. Hilariously bad die rolling luck failed our mission.

First Impressions: This was my competitor to Kitchen Rush on SPIEL 2017, and this game really didn't appeal to me when the people try to sell it to me. Don't really see the added value of the app in this game. I dislike that you only have 1 sand timer per person, although I understand why they did it. Still feels kinda restrictive. The big cardboard boat looks impressive at first, but that appeal quickly faded for me. It's only for show; not functional.

Eye-catching production in this family game about cooperatively sailing a ship while undertaking a campaign to explore the seas. Could be prone to quarterbacking, but the sand timers that only the owning player may move help keep everybody active in the game. The phone app is polished with graphics that are on par with the beautiful bits in the game box. The app provides difficulty settings for the scenarios and an easy to follow tutorial. Not my type of game, but I'd recommend it to families that enjoy co-ops because of its fast playing time.

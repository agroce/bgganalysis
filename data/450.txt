Chess, Checkers, I hate these games.  I just can't think ahead several turns like that.  It's just something I can't do.  This game requires planning and it uses very clever mechanics and such, but I can't stand games like this.  Just not my cup of tea.  Way too painful when playing against someone who has the ability to set you up in this.  Eck.

This game punishes beginners mightily: until you learn many standard openings, and how to react to and defend against them, you have no chance against an even minorly experienced player.

RATING: 4.5
A great abstract game where you must decide just one action from a great array of possibilities, thus making great sacrifices. Each decision is agonizing.

UPDATE: It's a weird abstract, with a lot of AP. It's interesting, but not a lot of fun.

Making a choice between building a piece or moving a piece each turn makes this different from most other games of it's genre.  What really makes it great though is the ability to stack your pieces, creating a huge potential number of moves, many of which are not trivial.  The wraparound board is a thing of beauty, as well.

Gave this game a go this weekend with a friend. I only manage one victory out of three. However it was very interesting. I'm very positive on this game. Its as good as the Gipf lineup although not as beautiful or well made. The concept of building your pieces is excellent. I've ordered Senjustsu for the same reason. This is a great ideo IMHO.

Nice simple abstract game. On your turn you can either add a peg to one of your pieces or move one of your pieces. Each peg allows your piece to move a different direction.

RATING: 9
Octi is an obscure and under-appreciated abstract game that deserves better exposure. The basic rules, which used to be poorly named "Octi for Kids," is brilliant on its own. The more advanced rules don't offer too much more to the table that would make you abandon the basic rules, but is fun to play on occasion.

Ramp up checkers by giving a piece the ability to move in many directions, to leap friendly pieces, and to re-enter the game after capture, and you get Octi. You might like this game even if you do not like Checkers. The potential sacrifices and jumping combos of Octi make the Checkers versions of the same seem pedestrian.

RATING: 8
Very impressed, both by the idea and the execution.  Quality of the new (tenth anniversary?) edition was excellent.  Really liked the idea of customising your pieces, and the need to balance increasing "strength" against positional development.  Small (6x7) game very tactical.

The mark of a great abstract: such simple rules and yet such a balanced, interesting game with intriguing development. This one demands to be played multiple times in one sitting. This is a game that requires as much of a building of offense as it needs a consideration of defense - or at least, thwarting your opponent's plans. Very smart game!

A good game. Reminds me somewhat of Camelot. I worry that the first mover is at a disadvantage. The game is excruciatingly slow to start out but has some nice layers of variability and many reasonable moves to chose from at various points. I played only the basic version but wonder how interesting the expert version would be as you bring your own pieces back. Limiting the prongs is an interesting decision and I haven't experienced the limitations it creates. Needs some more play.

I picked up the "Octi Extreme" version at Goodwill for $2 or $3. First impression was not so good - the pieces looked dumb and the board was made of cheap cardboard that was somewhat warped so it wouldn't lay flat.  The pieces remind me of "The Vegetable Man" from an old fifties horror movie.
  
However, when I talked my boardgame best buddy into giving it a try, we both liked it quite a bit. I lost all three or four of the games we played and we're still learning some of the intricacies.  I can see us pulling it out once in a while.

One of these days I might run across a newer version; the redesigned pieces seem to have a more appealing look.

Within 10 minutes Octi had already established itself as a family favourite.  The cost vs benefit of each move was joyfully considered but play never faltered as though a ridiculous number of options appear at every move the simplicity of the rulesets and objectives allows for a largely intuitive play.  I look forward to further games of Octi and look forward to the day when I can capture that third base.

RATING: 9
This is one of those abstracts where you slap your forehead and go, "I could've designed this"... and then you remember that you're just not THAT smart. Simplicity combined with well-known ideas but those prongs, what a wonderful idea that just takes checkers to the level that it really needs to be a great game.

The prongs bring a level of 'clarity' that is often lacking in many other 'jumping/capture' games.

A really good game, and a novel idea.  You can see the threats building as your opponent equips his pieces for the attack...the key is to keep him worrying about what he can see YOU preparing to do.  But just when you think you know what your opponent is up to, WHAM! you're blindsided by the astonishing move he's able to make that you couldn't envision, although everything that went into the move was fully exposed right there on the board.  Simple rules, complex options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I have trouble keeping up with multi-jump games and this one makes it even more complex with the limited # of directions a certain piece can go.  I like the fact that if you wait untill a piece is in trouble to add to its capabilities then it's really too late.

It's interesting and very different from other abstracts I've played.

I usually play with the fast rules (win by capturing only one base) and without the super-prongs. I think they add too much complexity to a game that is already very very complex. 
Anyway, a very good game, with deep tactics and some strategy.

I own what I suppose is now considered the first edition, bought in May 2001 (wooden pieces, rubberized board). My rating of 7 is for the base game. Utilizing the super-prong and endless board brings it up to an 8.

RATING: 6
After 12 plays. Tactics and look-ahead are much easier to grok in this game than strategy, probably because the board can change a great deal between turns.  My biggest complaints are it starts slow, the rules are a bit fiddly, and inserting the pegs into the playing pieces feels cumbersome.  Gameplay itself is an absolute joy, if still bewildering for me.  If strategy develops around this game, it has a chance of becoming a true classic, though it seems not many people play it, so this baby may be stillborn. 

Can make a bad first impression on players who aren't into this kind of game because the opening is very staid and players will just assume the whole thing is staid (it's anything but staid - it's a really "jumpy" game)

I wish the physical pieces had "legs" that were a permanent part of the piece and could be folded out to activate, rather than tiny little pegs you have to insert.

Uninspiring. The "Extreme" edition features, in addition to the worst board I've ever seen, a "fast" version of the rules in which you only need capture one of your opponent's bases. This suffers from an icky endgame in which we both know who is going to win, but have to make several more moves. I'll try the standard version, but don't have my hopes up.

Start with 3 basic space ships facing your opponent. Decisions are whether to upgrade a pod (add a prong, allowing it to move or jump pieces like checkers, but only in a certain direction) or move, with the winner having to occupy one of the enemy spaces. Decisions on whether to put pressure on your opponent or react. Surprised I haven't heard more about this game. Games can end rather quickly if someone blunders. Played 4 games (2 players) of the basic game - this is actually quite fun!

Not a huge fan of abstract games but this one is pretty fun.  Typically games will come down to a few "big plays" where many octagons get eaten up in one move.  I like how you can trap your opponents and they know they're about to be jumped but can do little to stop it since their pieces can only move in certain directions.

My favorite Abstract strategy game.  Rules in new box are not quite up to snuff, but with a few modifications of the rules...AWESOME!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Nifty abstract which merges jumping and stacking moves with attacks on other pieces in order to occupy the enemy's ground positions, and introduces the control of the pieces' mobility - the player can start at a quick pace moving pieces early but in few directions, or take some time to allow the pieces comfortable movement on the board. 

This cunning element gives the game an unusual depth of play, since compromises are difficult to reach; rather often both players build on their pieces until the play starts rather furiously and then stops. The shaping of the strategies in which pieces with different "agilities" are involved is an art, especially when using stacks. 

Throw in a variation suppressing the boundaries of the board and you get an incredibly rich game, which can be learnt quite intuitively despite some little adjustments in the rules, and which can deliver challenging and very engaging gameplay for the new and the expert.

It's a good game, but... the degree of lookahead is so large that it's difficult to play sensibly.  Combine this with the unfortunate tedium of adding the gadgets that indicate the directions a piece can move, and you've got a good game that almost never sees the table.

Octi is a very good two-player abstract.  Games start out cautiously, as both players add prongs to their pods.  Then, pieces start flying aroung the board, making multiple jumps and captures.  There are a ton of choices in Octi, such as should you push forward trying to assault the enemy or hang back and defend, or should you make powerful "queen" pieces that look like they are bristling with firepower and can move in all directions but risk losing all those prongs in a capture?  Lots of decisions, lots of fun.

excellent game, highly addictive and in many ways amazing. 
You should begin with the 6x7 version (former Octi for Kids, a very misleading title. "Octi for Wunderkinder" seems to be be more appropriate). So it's way easier to understand how it works.
The Extreme Version is a bit too ambitious (when applying all rules) and more a demonstration of how to achieve complexity than an actual game that wants to be played. Played this quite a lot on www.highergames.com.

Though this purely strategic and tactical game starts off slowly - which, in a way, is part of its charm - its mechanisms can make for sudden scary changes in dominance.  In one game, I captured all but one of my opponent's pieces in one or two turns.  Obvious victory, right?  My opponent managed to keep just one move out of my reach, repopulate, and win, in a matter of maybe 5 more turns.  Very cool.  Who has ever won a game of [international] chess or xiang qi with only one piece left?

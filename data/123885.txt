It is a simple exercise in speed and accuracy, but the cards are thick and the images are cute. Games are tense and engaging. Players seem to be really bad at it, or really good. It's light enough that you can laugh at your (or other people's) failings without anyone getting offended! Really fun, especially when Pick-a-pig and Pick-a-dog are combined to create a massive 8 player grid (called Pick-a-pog).

Have played both, Pick-a-Dog and Pick-a-Pig (and a combination of both). An excellent party game, although not too original. I am afraid that combining the two games makes the game more susceptible to situations where one player cannot pick any cards from the table. This happened to us too many times to be just a mere coincidence.

I rated it a 3 because of my desire to play it. There is a speed element and I despise most games with that mechanism. However, if you are looking for family-friendly, or non-gamer-friendly game you could do a lot worse than selecting this. It's also the type of game I would put in a white elephant gift exchange. In other words, a terrible game for me, but I can see where others would like it a lot.

Pick-a-Pig and Pick-a-Dog are some decent speed games, but there are a myriad of these on the market, so they need to be visibly different from the majority. I think they fail to do so, so while they are good games, they are not games I need to own (although they are very cheap and kids like them). It’s a speed game sort of like Spot It as you need to find similar matches, but there is a catch. All of the pictures show a pig (or a dog), and the pig has some traits: it has either one or two arms, sunglasses or not, holding popcorn or not, is pink or brown or is big or small. You grab cards as quickly as possible (the cards are laid out in a 5x6 grid iirc), and these cards need to be exactly similar to your previous card, or it needs to only have exactly one difference! So a big, pink, two-armed pig can be taken and put on top of your big, brown, two-armed pig etc. It’s pretty simple and actually a fine game, but I really only need the best of the best. Families with small children should definitely pig (ahem) up this game.

Seriously boring game. That my daughter happens to like. She's a Set master, so anything like that is up her alley. But unlike Set where you have to find a set of cards, in this game you build a sequence, where every card is either exactly the same, or differs in only one attribute. All players in real-time. That's pretty pretty much it.

The usability of the game is in the tank. The cards are completely unshuffleable. And since cards are collected in a sequence of matching cards, it's critical that cards are shuffled well. But it's nigh unto impossible. Both due to the size/shape (small squares), and the physical construction (overly stiff).

RATING: 5.25
Rated after 1 play @ 4 players

Each round you attempt to claim dog cards from the center board that only contain a single difference with the card you last picked (or started with). Move fast because other players can take the card you've been eyeing up. The round ends when a player cannot pick anything from the center and then each player's pile is checked for correctness. 

This is very much a dexterity and speed game. It's quick to setup and explain but doesn't offer much in the way of different game play between games. It can play in 15-25 minutes and probably works best at the higher play counts. Not my favorite type of game but willing to play with the right group and circumstance.

Quick-reaction games are always a crapshoot; they're fun mostly if failure is, for some reason, funny or brain-twisting. I didn't find it to be either in this game; you just go, "Oh, huh, I guess those dogs aren't the same after all."

A pattern recognition, speed matching game. Players simultaneously pick out bears from an array that have at least one matching aspect to the bear on the top of their stack.

Very simple rules and clean and cute artwork make this a nice little filler.

A fun little speed observation game that is different enough from the others to stand out and quick enough that its lack of novelty isn't really an issue.

I do feel that it's a little too punitive - if you make one mistake you're pretty much out of the running. Also, having to check each person's cards for accuracy keeps the game from achieving true greatness.

If we'd stopped after playing just Pick-a-Dog, my rating could easily have ended up a 2: the game was too cramped, rounds were too short, it was clear that in every game you could have someone feeling robbed of a card grab or being the first to call end of round. Mixing in Pick-a-Pig improved things to quite tolerable. It's still not a game I would request, but I might prefer it to Set. Note that it only really works properly if everyone can be seated at equal distances from the centre of the tableau, so that if you don't have a small or circular table you should not play this with more than four. Probably the only game where part of the fun is that you get to sit and croon, "Loses an arm... gains an arm... becomes cool... loses popcorn... becomes a pig."

Rating based on 2-5 players.

Good, fast-paced fun! I'm usually not that into speed games, but this has quite a few things going for it:
-the action is constant
-it's not played head-to-head, so people can go at their own speed without getting discouraged (and being slower but careful can be a plus!)
-no dealer advantage/disadvantage
-as people are doing their own thing, you have much less of a chance of smashed hands and situations of trying to judge who grabbed something first
-each round lasts around a minute, and I can't imagine the full game being more than 8. There is a defined end (no "play until someone empties their hand"), so it doesn't outstay its welcome, which I think this the main problem I have with speed games
-cute art (I have the pig version, and cartoon pigs are always good in my book)

This rating is a bit of a weird one, as this isn't a game I'd play again and again, but for what it is I really liked it!

First impression (5 players): Fast abstract filler speed (recognization) game. You really want to have a round table for this one as everyone is trying to grab cards as fast as they can and being further away than others is a big handicap. Actually Formissimo might even be a bit too easy and therefore too fast.

Simpatico e immediato filler di destrezza. Lo scopo del gioco è trovare prima degli altri giocatori i cagnolini che abbiano delle somiglianze con quello in possesso, si continua a prendere dei cani fino a quando non si reputa che non si possa più andare avanti. Appena la mano finisce si valuta chi ha preso più carte cane e si fanno punti se non si sono commessi errori, se no si perde tutta la mano. Un gioco semplicissimo ma divertente. Le partite durano 5'.

A very simple, fast paced game of card snatching from a common pile. Players start with a single card and then stack dogs on top that are the same or have one change. However, you may be trying to grab the same cards as other players. This is a good end of the night easy game that everyone can leisurely enjoy. You don't have to keep score and the cute graphics keep it light.

RATING: 5
Cute illustrations and a clever but simple variation to pattern matching by allowing one degree of error which actually makes it more difficult than straight forward pattern matching but ultimately this is a reaction game and far too hectic for me, unfortunately. Sorry pigs/dogs!

Pick-a-Dog is a super-simple speed-based pattern recognition game. There isn't anything overtly clever about the game, but the artwork is cute enough, and my kids have enjoyed playing it. You might call it Set for kids, at least to some degree.

Pick a pig

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A surprisingly fun dexterity/speed game where players simultaneously reach into the center of the table to a 7x7 grid and build a stack/sequence of animals where each new card added to their pile either a.) is the same card, or b.) differs by exactly one attribute. Trickier than it sounds, and good fun. 

Much better when you play the combined Pig/Dog versions. The addition of the different animal really helps the game. The real joy comes from the simultaneous and frantic grabbery, and the requirement to tell a story as you unveil your sequence shouldn't be overlooked. Good silly fun.

Secret Santa got me this game. In Pick a Dog there are many cards displaying a dog. The dogs may differ in five features from eachother: size, color, arms, glasses and popcorn.
A find a lot of cards on the table and each player is dealt out one card. Then all players simultaneously grab cards which differ by maximum one aspect then the previous card. And if there are no more, you shout stop.
The player who does that at best is the winner.
The cards really look cute and this is a fun fast game which lasts only a few minutes.

I wish I could have separate comments under Pick-A-Dog and Pick-A-Pig, but alas.

I actually like this pattern recognition game. It's fast and it's fairly simple to learn. it doesn't tie your brain into knots. I also like that everyone is working simultaneously and that it's kind of a race, but not really. You can still feel like you're playing even if there are faster players at the table.

Plus, pigs and dogs! Come on. You also can play this as a storytelling game. "Once upon a time there was a dog with some popcorn. Then, he lost his popcorn. Then he lost an arm. And then he turned into a pig."

Hacer series de cartas a toda pastilla, consiguiendo que la carta que pillas del tablero sólo tenga una diferencia con la anterior, es una tarea difícil. Pero si se hace a un ritmo frenético y sin turnos, todavía más. Y ya es tarea imposible si unes los dos juegos para jugar al "Pick a Perdo"

surprisingly adequate.  I did not expect this to actually be a game.  It's entirely visual pattern matching combined with some random accidental player interference, but it's extremely good for a game of that nature.

Another speed recognition game. A bit different in that you're doing a series  (each part is connected to previous one) simultaneously and figuring out when you're done is the hardest part. Competition is not so direct, therefore easier on new players that other simultaneous speed games. Now it's time for me to give a big shout out to perfect graphic design solution and execution! (check the prototypes...). Pigs and dogs work like a charm and kids love them as well. 

EDIT: Playing it with storytelling house rule (when checking cards tell a story) the game is really cute and quite popular.

1 play.

It is a fun short filler, and it is CHEAP. But I don't really need a quick filler, although I'd certainly play it if a game happened to be starting up! Of course, I wouldn't do very well at it ....

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each card in the deck shows a pig with several characteristics:
- big/small
- pink/brown
- one/two arms
- with/without popcorn
- with/without sunglasses
Shuffle the deck and lay out a 5x6 grid. Players each get one card face down; reveal simultaneously. Then race to grab a card with 0-1 different characteristics, compared to the card on top of your stack; place the new card on top of your stack. Continue until no playable cards are left: slap the table. The first slap ends the round. That player shows all their cards in order; if no mistakes were made, they score all the cards plus one bonus card taken from the display. If they erred, they score nothing. All other players then go through their stacks, scoring all cards if no mistakes were made.

When you get through the deck, deal the last n cards to the players, who will play a final round with a partially filled display. The player who collected the most cards wins!

Pick-A-Pig challenges players to empty their stack of cards by matching them with cards on the table - the trick is that the images are all similar-looking and you can only "match" cards that are either identical or have only one difference between them. Combined with the fact that everyone's rushing to be the first to finish their stack and hijinx is sure to ensue!

Good speed game - I think with more cards this would be even better and mediate the luck factor a bit, sometimes one person has a really good run due to some luck at the start, but then over the course of the individual rounds it evens out a bit.

Grab a sequence of cards from a tableau - each card can be identical to the last or differ in only one characteristic. Simple, but actually fun.

Normally, I hate speed games. Hate as in "no good at". Here, I seem to be pretty decent - its more pattern recognition than speed, and its more important to be correct than to be quick.

After discovering the game at Essen 2012, but only after they'd sold out of copies, I'm delighted Gryphon Games have published this.

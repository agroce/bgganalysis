Takes a good game and blows it out of proportion.  We keep the good bits, and throw out the more confusing bits.  We like the individual countries, but by now the deck is far too big!  Too many secrets, too mnny cards, changes the game flow.

It is unlikely this game will ever get played after the fiasco of Nuclear War; so the rating is based on NO PLAYS and is in fact based on the game from which this is an expansion.  If you want to know what I thought about Nuclear War, see my comment there; that justifies my low rating here.

It's an expansion for the beer and pretzels game of Nuclear Warfare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This expansion introduces specific country abilities to the game; they aren't overpowering and add some chrome.  Like Nuclear Escalation's space platforms, the submarines here make wars slightly more lethal while saboteurs increase the chance of a failed attack.  The atomic cannon and stealth bomber make the game more forgiving about having warheads without launchers.  I recommend playing with all expansions as they provide more options for mayham without greatly increasing the complexity of the game.

Best when combined with Nuclear War and Nuclear Escalation.  The personalities of the countries are OK, but we used to role play it before Nuclear Proliferation was released anyway!  When combining all three of the series there are definately too many secrets and top secret cards.  You can lose a couple of players during the secrets round.

This is the same thing as Nuclear War. Trust me, it's the same game, just the cards are a bit different. play this standalone or as an expansion:

Random yet hilariously fun card game about a nuclear war. Players "program" their turns 2 turns in advance, placing a third card face down and turning up the topmost card. A launcher followed by a warhead the next turn will cause population loss for a neighbouring country. And the population is also random - cards drawn that vary from 1 million to 25 million inhabitants.

Don't even think about this game if you like game with tactics. This is just a random "take that!" game that's great fun if you know how to enjoy it.

An okay enough game, although it struck me as a simplified Pax Porfiriana, a game that I much prefer. The Wild West theme is very good. The "take that" cards  can set you back in a pretty significant way, which could be unbalanced. The cards are super-text-heavy, which slows things down a bit as aged eyes strain to read the 6-point font.

We didn't play the 2p rule of two ranches for each player, because that's just silly. Definitely worth trying with more players, although not destined to be a favorite. Like I said, I'd much rather play Pax instead.

Erh, I can take it or leave it.  The mechanic and scoring are more complex than they need to be, and the "Ha, I'll take everything you have and you can't stop me" factor is a little too high for my tastes...

Downtime too long, some cards are absolutely unbalanced while you can do nothing against to. Too luck-dependent. Great theme, but unfortunately not my cup of tea.

After only one play, I&#039;m a bit worried that either a) it all comes down to luck or b) it doesn&#039;t, but once the novelty of playing it wears off, it&#039;ll never hit the table again.  Three of us were learning (in a 4-player game), so it also took longer than the weight of the game merits... but I&#039;d try it again, especially with people who know how to play already.

Absolutely ridiculous game that makes me want to hit with a shovel A) the person who hoisted it upon us and B) myself, in a vain attempt to forget this horrible gaming experience.  A completely random take-that card game with unbalanced cards and wildly incongruous theme (cattle surveillance check anyone?) and mounds of frustation, Lawless is  among the worst euro games I have ever had the displeasure to play.  The actual feeling of starting up a successful ranch is stifled by the hosage of the cards.  You spend most of the game restarting your ranch and then the game ends with you having accomplished nothing.  Don't get me started on the completely non-sequitur game conditions.  Avoid at all costs.

An excellent game for a long lazy Saturday afternoon. Probably no good for non-gamers as it is in many ways a game of exceptions. Similarly, a lot of the fun might depend on having a sympathetic group. If you have those two things, however, this is a great evocative enjoyable game.

The Line is an interesting way of drawng cards, and it gives you a way to see what nasty surprises are in store a few turns in advance.  The scoring system also encourages well-rounded play, rewarding players not for excelling in one area but for performing modestly in all areas.  Lots of luck... do you fancy yourself a gambler?  Go ahead and take some risks... that's what makes Lawless exciting!  And if you get hosed, don't worry; you'll have plenty of time to recover.  (Thank you, publisher, for putting game text on the cards!  I wish Bang! and Naval Battles did that.)

Sort of where "Bang" meets "Puerto Rico"?  More of a building game where you can mess with your neighbor's ranch.

I liked this better the second time I played.  This also does not pay well with only two players; the more the better.

This game can be very vicious as you crush the hopes of the other players as they try to have productive ranches.

Out of my collection.

It's a "build my stuff, bash your stuff" game based in the Old West.  My skin is a little thin for this kind of game (Burn Rate is another such game).  But with the card selection and action point mechanics, it gives you a little more control than just draw what's on the top of the deck.

RATING: 7
Western themed card game: earn points for building the most ranges, having the most cattle, cowboys, and money.  The powerful Mayor card needs a tweak to balance it (only use before owner's turn - or else just remove it), and there may also be a few other cards which could be considered over-powered.  The game also seems to benefit the person who can play a lot of range & cow cards for scoring just before the end is triggered - see my suggestions for tweaking the scoring [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/449040]here[/url].  The theme, however, is solid and fun, and I like the fact that the timing of the game end (money or cards run out) is somewhat unpredictable.  The card line and action point system reminds me a little of Through the Ages.  Very high player interaction - some "Take That" elements and leader bashing that not everyone will like, but the strong theme makes up for that in my view.  Great theme and nice artwork too.  There is luck of the draw, so don't take it too seriously and get stuck in analyzing your position, best enjoyed when played fairly quickly.  Especially shines for people familiar with the game and cards, and more than two players.

Lawless was rethemed as "The Sons of Samarande" (Les Fils de Samarande) with slightly improved rules, see an overview [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/684813#684813]here[/url].  Examples: 60 gold in bank regardless of players; each player draws 8 cards at start and keeps 4; different scoring.  It's probably worth tinkering with the scoring of Lawless to remove the strategy of quickly playing herds/ranges before game end.  Bruno Faidutti says "The western theme worked better for me, but I must admit that the rules have been greatly improved for this new version, especially with the complete reworking of the scoring system, now much more challenging and interesting."

Rules notes: 
1. Herds do not "age" if the Range is subject to an Indian Raid, and are not taken into account for surveillance test or scoring unless the Calvary frees this Range.
2. "Hang 'Em High" can not be used on Hired Guns

Recommended house rules:
1. All players draw 8 cards and keep 4 at start of game.
2. Discard down to 4 cards at end of turn (to prevent stock piling of Ranges and Herds?).
3. Mayor can only be used at start of own turn.
4. Score at three points of the game (combine #2 & #3 [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/article/684813#684813]here[/url] - triggered with marked cards 1/3, 2/3, and 3/3 in deck)

A fun Wild West game; compact, fast play and well-balanced between chaos and control.  The scoring system works well in so far as the main source of income, cattle, will earn you gold or earn you points.  Pulling in gold draws the game nearer to the end but you can quite concievably handicap yourself by opting for this on every turn, for example.  I think there is a lot of play in this one, so rating may rise.

Love the theme and the way it&#039;s portrayed in the game. Unfortunately,  there&#039;s nothing special or original in the mechanics plus actions are unbalanced. Leader bashing ensures that the whole game changes on the last turn. Since this last turn is usually unpredictable, it can screw you big time.

I normally rate card games higher than most people but this one really rubbed me the wrong way.  We spent a lot of time looking up rules for such a simple game.  Several little combos showed up that seemed too powerful.  Meanwhile, the luck of the draw on dice and cards ruled the day and the boring scoring mechanism kept things artificially close.  I got screwed with a cattle raid right at the end and there aren't many tense decisions.  A good beer and pretzels cowboys/dude ranch game.

A mix of take that, hand and resources management in a little box.  The money is terrible but I rather like the cards.
For a compact price and a compact box, this is a perfect game to travel with; it feels like an euro game with a theme and with a solid dose of luck.
This game is much improved with intermediate scorings (I use two small labels to mark two cow cards), insuring that players build and keep balanced ranches.
I bought Les Fils de Samarande which simply suppressed the best parts of the original imho.

RATING: 5
Could be more interesting, as I'm not a big fan of playing cards to screw over your opponent, and it's a big part of this game.  The cattle hurding and trying to increase their value appears to be too light, as the focus is geared more towards trying to slow down, steal from or hinder your opponents.

Will still give this game another go, with more players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Interesting, yet frustrating game of the Wild West. It is a card drafting/playing game involving action points. Six random cards show up in a row on a AP scale--the leftmost card is 6 AP to 'buy' or 'draft' into your hand, while the rightmost card is 1 AP. You can buy a card blind from the deck for 3 AP. As cards are taken, the ones that are not bought slide to the right, getting cheaper for the next player. Each player has 6 AP to draft and play cards.  The cards represent ranches, cattle, cowboys, events, and other characters, such as hired guns, The Sheriff, The Mayor, etc. Each card has a AP value that you must expend to get into play.

The object is to get 'out' (i.e. played from your hand) the most ranches, cattle, cowboys, and gold, at the end of the game. However, this is very difficult in practice. There are a number of event cards that could destroy your ranches, or kill your cowboys, or steal your gold. There are also cards that get you stuff, such as more gold, or protection, in the form of the Trapper, or helping you keep your cattle from running away, in fences.

This is like any other card playing game, as there are a large number of special cards that benefit you, or allows you to screw your neighbor. As such, players are constantly screwing each other over, trying to prevent them from accumulating ranches, cattle, cowboys, or gold. In a 3P game, it was a most brutal cut-throat game. You may be doing well, when wham! someone plays a railroad, which destroys your ranch and any cattle on it. A hired gun may kill your cowboy(s), which are necessary to keep the cattle from running away each turn. It is a constant struggle to survive.

The game is extremely chaotic. I suppose it is devilishly fun in the screw-your-neighbor category, and as a game, it seems to work better in conveying how rough The Wild West was, than Bang! for example. 60 minutes may be a bit much for this kind of chaos, however. I'd play it again, but don't foresee it sticking around that much afterwards.

Update (01/20/12): Initial rating was a '7'. It's been 2.5 years and I don't miss this game a bit, nor do I have any desire to play it. It's a '4'.

Update (02/10/13): Never going to play this again. It's a '2'.

A fun game that reminds me of munchkin,or family business.Can be enjoyed from 2-6 players.If you play with 2 make sure you use the special rules for 2 players.Also the mayor card is very powerful when playing with fewer players and you might want to use a  modified rule of only letting him rearrange the cards before his turn only.With more players it seems as if it is pretty easy for someone to kill the mayor.

Just a fun game.  A game I enjoy playing even if I lose.  However, the "mayor" card feels very overpowered and unbalancing.

Not a terrible game. I'd compare it to other light filler games like Chez Geek or Munchkin but yet it's not that comedic nor strategy-void. This is an extremely light Catan or something that Puerto Rico players would use for filler. The element of balancing four different point makers (Cowboys, Ranges, Herds, and Cash) make it fun. If it weren't for the scoring system it would be no more than a matching up system of hoping for the proper card draws.

Lawless is an addicting and fun game in which mayhem and (well) lawlessness prevail over planning and strategy.  The abundance of luck fits the old-west theme perfectly.

I felt like this game had a lot of potential. In fact, it has a lot of elements of a game I was trying to design once. The "take that" nature of the game spoils the fun for me. Also, the attrition of the cattle is too severe. I'd rather build a nice little farm in Agricola.

I have the German version.  The rules are absolutely horrible.  They are ambigous and don't properly explain various situations.  Hopefully the English and French versions are better.  Lawless is just too much of a "take-that" cardgame for my taste.  While the theme is interesting, the mechanics are nothing special and there is really no point in making any plans, as you are likely to be walloped with a ton of special cards.  My group gave it a unanimous thumbs down.

I love Westerns and I bought this Bruno Cathala game on that premise.  Sadly it didn't quite live up to my expectations but still provided a few good "western" moments.

Pros: The action selection/execution system is different and interesting. Good, interesting theme that is a good diversion from the standard medici/renaissance stuff.
Cons: The game felt more like a prototype than a fine-tuned designer game; we felt that the main mechanic of the game (selling cows to get cash) was hard to accomplish as there wasn't enough cows in the deck and too many special actions. Some of the special actions costs seem to be a little out of whack. 
Verdict: Good concept, poor execution. I'd like to give this another shot, but it will be hard to convince others to do so.

Played once and won...using a brothel to lure the other people's cowboys to my side.  Pretty fun fillerish game where you try to collect most cowboys, cows, gold, etc.  Thought some cards like the mines were way too powerful (or maybe it's just cause I didn't get any).

Lots of player interaction.  Not quite sure why this game isn't more popular but it's a good game with a fun theme.  Loads of chaos which some people might not like.

One day I figured I needed a change of scenery, realized I don't actually have anything western-themed in my game collection, and picked up Lawless on a whim. It's been gathering dust on the shelves of my FLGS for years, and they were practically giving it away.

Well now! What a pleasant surprise. There's quite a bit more nastiness and mayhem than what I generally look for in a card game, but I suppose that's the way of the West for you. The underlying resource management mechanism feels solid and clever, but with the amount of shooty bits and other ways to attack your opponent's ranch, the game seems to be not so much about building your power base than about making a quick profit from what you can and staying on the lookout for lucrative shootouts.

Not my usual cup of tea, then, but as I said, I was looking for a change of scenery - and perhaps pace as well. I like Lawless well enough for now, and can see it becoming a minor hit with the right crowd.

*The Mayor did not seem overly powerful when we played with it-it did slow the cards coming out of the deck though, & forced people to make really good plays with what they had.

Really enjoy playing this game, depending on what mood you are in you can go on the complete offensive or just build up the best ranch you can. The game is a little long and you can feel a little picked on if you are lucky enough to have a decent card/cowboy. Once you've learnt not to worry about losing good cards and enjoy a little luck, then this game is brilliant for interactive gaming with mates.

A bit too fiddly for the theme.  Edit: After trying the game, that criticism was not strong enough.  There just isn't much there to excite.  Plenty of chaos, but not much interest.

I thought it was quite enjoyable:  light, fun, a different kind of a theme (in how many games do get to be a cattle rancher?), and fairly quickly paced.  The downside:  the roll-to-see-if-your-cows-leave-every-turn became a bit tedious.

(5+ plays) I bought this game because the idea of a ranch building game seemed neat.  This is a game about cow killing.

I liked it in my only playing, but am not sure if there aren't some balance and runaway leader issues. UPDATE: Still enjoyable after more playings. Possible problems have not materialized yet.

What a fun game this is to play! I like it when people get into the flavor, and trash talk, and role-play. The action point system is one that I usually dislike, but it works very well with THIS game. Simple turns, and great artwork make this a very enjoyable game. To facilitate play, we've adopted a house rule to remove the MAYOR. Personally, I think the card adds a lot of fun to the game with bribes, and threats, but that wheeling and dealing really slows the game down.

Great theme; quick play; easy to teach. Being from a family of ranchers and having a grandfather that wrote several New Mexico histories I tend to get frustrated with western themed games that don't capture the spirit of the west. This game succeeds and has a great western 'feel'.

Nothing out of the ordinary in the mechanics (and I wonder about the balance of the deck composition) but the game provoked a decent Wild West feel.  Would certainly play it again.

[3 plays] First two were 2 player games. Fun card game with lots of luck but also plenty of decisions to be made as well. As others have said (but I don't say it disparagingly) it more than anything is a game about killing your opponents cattle. Beware the too powerful mayor card! Modify it, get rid of it, or be prepared to deal with some serious power balance issues.

Update 3-2010:  Played with 4. Chaotic, but fun. I think the other players' criticisms were on target. It is really hard to get anything going, and the amount of screwage is too high. It would be nice to be able to build some things about your ranch that last. Still, there are some cool things in this game, and I love the theme.

Most recent play 3-13-10 at Cabin Con 2010.

Better than most "take that" games in that it isn't clunky (all the cards are easy figure out at first glance), it has some fun mechanics (fattening the cows) and there are real decisions to be made besides who to gang up on.  However, you are still at the whim of the draw (and there's some cards that are much more powerful than others) and it's too long for what it is.

You are a ranch owner in the old West trying to raise the fatest cattle on the largest ranch. Buy land, buy herds, hire cowboys to protect them. Hire rustlers to scatter the herds of your rival ranchers, they pay off the Sheriff to look the other way. If you don't have the sheriff in your pocket, hire a gunfighter to scare him off. Easy game with enough wrinkles to keep it interesting. Plays best with 3-5.

Fun enough "take that" game.  If you tweak the mayor to just change cards at the end of the owning player's turn he becomes balanced out.  Way too long for three players.  The number of cards should have been scaled down.  Overall a satisfying game.  Much prefered over Bang!

Get the range, then the herd, and supply plenty of cowboys..............

Rules are oddly obtuse -- the phrase "livestock surveillance check" belongs in an SPI game, not here.  I think that sums up my take on this game, there's a lot going on, but the end result isn't quite worth the effort.

Only one play, and the cards available never seemed to enable me to get going. I'd call it "barely controlled chaos" except that 3 of the 7 players seemed to go from strength to strength, so maybe there's more to it than meets the eye.

Actually not a bad game. Very chaotic, yes, but not a bad game. The only thing that disturbs me a little would be the Railroad card. Seems way powerful. Maybe a house rule or two would bring my rating up a little bit.

En el juego de cartas Lawless, cada jugador tiene un rancho del Salvaje Oeste. Para mejorar su rancho, los jugadores deben comprar tierras y ganado y contratar cowboys. Todo esto deben hacerlo en medio de una guerra con los indios, ladrones de bancos, asaltadores de diligencias, duelos en el salón, cuatreros. En este mundo salvaje, el camino legal no es probablemente el mejor para hacerse rico.

I typically like card-drafting games, but this one was a bit fiddly and slow. I also don't like games where there are cards that attack another player until the counter-card happens to show up, and there's quite a few of these in Lawless. It's also chalk-full of special cards that all do different things as they show up, meaning a lot of tiem is spent with players reading text-heavy cards before they are able to draft. All in all, a sub-par offering that wasn't much fun.

If I was a sculptor,  but,  then again,  no....

Speaking of art - what a waste of beautiful graphics and theme immersion. This is a stunning presentation with some innovative ideas,  that no matter how much you want it to work,  in the end,  just never really meshes. 

Perhaps somewhere in the future,  if time should ever become so trivial,  I might actually seek this out again to see if it can be salvaged.  But the thought of seeing it all again,  and the possibility of,  dare I say,  watching it come crashing down like a house of cards,  may be a bit more than I can take.

I must say, this is the surprise of the bunch for me.  I don't like westerns, nor really the idea of The West.  I wasn't too keen on even trying this game.  But it's been an absolute riot.  It stirs up people like few other games I've tried, and has been enormous fun.  I'm not one for stirring people up in games, or even playing those type of games, but this one isn't too serious, and it provokes lots of laughter and 'grrrs' round the table.  Beginners loved it.  Recommended.  Long term repeat fun, good for beginners, and good for groups.

(7/09)   After one 3p game I found this to be a fun chaotic game of ranching.  Card draws can cause play to be chaotic, but it's a good game that I would play again.

Horribly luck-driven game, which could possibly be corrected with some house rules (the Mayor card is too powerful), but why spend the time trying to make a terrible game work when there are so many good games you could otherwise play?

Don't make me play this game again.

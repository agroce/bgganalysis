Kickstarter, a very easy game to teach. A basic Civ game that can be played in less than hour, yet this game has deep strategy and tactics that do not bog or slow it down (Even to AP people). the turns go by fast and there is very little down time,

This played very nicely with a fun mechanic of an "action tower" (list) that rotates between the players. 

The game is light & played quickly and with only half of the advancements used each game this has lots of replay-ability.  

I think this will go over well with those who like game such as "Splendor" or "Macho Koro".

Elég egyszerű, gateway játék, viszonylag fineszes alapmechanikával, ami kicsit a small world fajválasztására hasonlít, itt azonban az akcióválasztást adja. Ezen túl némi erőforrás-gyűjtögetés, majd technológia fejlesztés, ami splendor-szerűen van megoldva. Kellemes játék, lemegy 60 perc alatt. Azért van benne szerencse bőven, különösen a események miatt.

Kiderült, hogy egy dolgot rosszul játszottunk, de a helyes szabályokkal szerintem sokkal rosszabb lett a játék. Így elég őrületes és bosszantó szerencse szerep van benn, ráadásul a játékidő is hosszabb. :( Kár érte.

Die Mechaniken des Spiels haben mir sehr gut gefallen, das Artwork ebenfalls. Leider war der Zufall beim Plättchen ziehen und welche Aktion für mich bleibt wenn ich dran bin sehr hoch.
Schönes Spiel, aber viel zu zufällig!

After first play (2 player).
Okay, so first, it is really quick, 30 min tops, and tight. I like the time path mechanism for action selection, although we seldom fought for specific actions, rather taking what was cheap. This might however be the key for playing the game better.
The visuals of this game are functional at best, and it bothers me, that the hexes don't have matching landscapes. Also having your markers on the tracks covering the level you have is sub-optimal. The second edition to-be-released by Kosmos later this year should improve on this.

Tribes: Early Civilization is a light game in which you're trying to work your way up a three-level technology track.  Players begin with three hex tiles and a hut on one of them, and each technology requires that you have huts on various types of hexes.  There are three actions in the game--grow, which lets you put more huts where you already have huts, move, which lets you move huts, and explore, which lets you draw new tiles.  Each of the technologies lets you bump your capability of one of those actions, letting you do it an additional time when chosen.  Technologies are worth points when claimed--more for higher-level technologies and more for being first.  Actions are drafted like races in Small World--if you don't want the bottom one, you can put a shell on it to take the next one up, leaving that shell for someone else to claim.  This was a very streamlined game, but I thought that the random tile draws played too much of a part in a player's overall success.  Additionally, for some reason it seemed easy to get stuck in a rut where a player repeatedly had to spend the maximum amount to get the action they wanted.

Really enjoy this one. Turns are super quick, the rules are very straight-forward and simple, and there's definitely depth. There is some player conflict but it doesn't seem overly aggressive.
Theme is apparent and the mechanics are solid. Has a euro feel and while you could probably substitute in a different theme without much effort I think this one works well.
In terms of chance and randomness, I like the variability of the tech tree but I could see not getting the tiles you need during a bag draw having some impact on play. Random events could also affect you before you have a chance to prepare/react. So there is some level of chance but I imagine most of the time it isn't enough to impact your final score much.
Overall, I'm very happy with Tribes: Early Civilization. I haven't played with more than two players but I imagine it would be even better.

This game just didn't pull it together for me. I was feeling hosed from early game until end game. You need specific resources to help advance your techs and the techs are all randomly placed out at the beginning and only discovered later in the game. Hard to plan for what you might need or want. It is a race to get #points and only when the number is hit will the game end. I honestly didn't feel like I made any quality choices and it just didn't work for me. Other's liked it more during play game so it could have just been a bad first play, unclear. Still waiting for the next [thing=126042][/thing].

Very interesting in terms of the mechanisms that are used to make this game happen. Not at all like Nations, which can be good or bad depending on if you like Nations. The tech tree randomness will create a wholly different game each play.

I've really enjoyed two and three-player sessions of Tribes. With our one four-player we hit a bit of an impasse where three of us all needed the same action tile and kept finding it out of reach due to a shell shortage and nobody enjoyed that. But I'd be happy to try it again.

nice light civ-ish game from designer of one of my favorite Civ games - Nations.  There are tech-trees that aren't "heavy" tech trees.  There are small comparisons to Catan with resource development.

Note: Played a pnp version from the kickstarter. I do not know how close it is to the final version.

Rules were simple, but the randomness of the game could be punishing. If the tiles you obtain from exploring do not match the resources needed for inventions it can be very frustrating. There is a mitigation action for this, but if you need a lot of one resource, this mitigation action isn't very unhelpful. 

Also the actions selection mechanism was interesting, but also frustrating as I felt like I was always left with the same cheap actions when it was my next turn.

A friend had considered buying this game, so I had looked at it previously, but only enough to see that it had an interesting action selection mechanism. So I was happy to try this one out when I saw it was available at Lobster Trap. When the game hit the table and we went through the rules, I realized that it was going to be a lighter game than I had anticipated.

There's two parts to this game. One part is building your personal map and "growing huts" and moving them around on your tiles. The huts represent a sort of virtual resource you can spend for the other part of the game... which is buying technologies.

For each hut on a resource, you have access to one of that resource. If you have the appropriate resources you can discover a technology. Discovering technologies give you points (with a bonus to the first player to do so) and some special ability. If you're ever short on resources you can permanently burn some of your resource tiles to get resources you need, but then you no longer have access to the resources on those tiles.

Discovering technologies reveals later technologies, and you can only learn later technologies by first learning the earlier technologies in that tech tree. It will also sometimes trigger events to enter the game (which sort of clog the action column).

The special abilities you get from technologies allow you to grow huts faster, move huts around more, and explore better (i.e. draw more tiles to choose for your area). There's also a strength ability that determines how events resolve. If you specialize in a special ability and get close to maxing it out you'll get extra points.

On your turn, you take a tile from a column of tiles. If you want to take anything other than the bottom tile, you have to pay a shell to every tile in the column up to the one you take. You then do whatever action is on that tile. The game starts with some tiles and technologies start adding new tiles (and sometimes events) to the column.

Ron and I went very different ways in our game. I got some early strength and spent a bunch of shells to force an event which cost Ron a bunch of his production tiles... so he was short on resources. But he collected shells, leaving me with none, so I was forced to always take the bottom-most tile in the action selection column... so I was very inflexible. It was neat that we could play the game with very different strategies.

There's a bit of randomness in the game as you never know what technologies are in play and what resources they require. In our game, incense never really came out and several of the technologies were incense based. That being said, it's a fairly light game, so I'm not that concerned about it. There was more to think about than was initially apparent here.

Played a prototype/print and play. Was very impressed. Tons of of interesting decisions in a short play time. Really smartly designed. Hope this one gets some traction.

Tribes is done by the same designer as Nations. It's definitely a different game than Nations. Our first game with 3 was done in about 45 minutes, with teaching The 2nd game was about 35 minutes. So it plays super quick. 

It's an engine builder with a modular random tech tree style mechanic. The tech tree is the meat of the game. You have 4 basic actions at the beginning of the game (explore, move, grow, invent). And you move up the tech tree by having tribes on the required resource spaces in your own personal hex map/tableau. At the same time you gain improved tech you net victory points. The first person to snag a new tech gets bonus VP, so it's a race to grab tech before your opponents. 

I'd be comfortable calling it an ultra light Clash of Cultures. Not that the game is ultra light itself, it's more mid weight full of interesting decisions. But compared to CoC, it's much lighter and extremely less fiddly. Also, it's not a 4x, it's a 3x as there are no battles since you're on your own independent maps. Though, mainly via events, and action selection there are ways to mess with your neighbors.

I will note, due to the play time, you're not getting a fully realized tech tree, you're just getting more powerful versions of the basic tech.

I have a bit of a problem with light eurogames. The supposed theme here is interesting, but gameplay is anything but thematic. It's not bad, and a long time ago I may well have liked it a whole lot more, but now it competes with too favorites to stand a chance.

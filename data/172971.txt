I rated this a 7 for its overall fun factor/ depth. As a gate way game to get people to table though, its a 10. Extremely fast and easy to teach. It looks pretty on the table and scales fairly well. Honestly I wish it scaled higher than 6 players. Its a great way to open up people minds to the possibility of playing other games with you.

First game plays included one adult and three kids ages 9, 7, and 4.  The 4 year old will be 5 in 3 months and was able to play though sometimes he forgot to keep taken gems and protected gems separate.  Everyone enjoyed the game a lot.  The game is easy to explain and extremely quick to setup.

With the right crowd, this game is a blast. My favourite part of the game is the build up and push your luck element of leaving your card full of gems in hopes that more than one person will point at it leaving you to collect more and more:)

We have added gems to the game. Now there is 36 in Red, Blue, and White and 18 Gold. Now you need a set of Red-White-Blue and the Gold are worth 2 points on their own.

New idea/possible variant: If you cover and no one points at your player card, you must return one gem from the card to any mushroom in the center. This can help negate the runaway leader that developed when we added gems to the game.

A goodbye comment upon trading it off:
My 6-year old daughter's only lament upon trading it off was that the gems were pretty cool.  Otherwise, she agreed that Go Nuts for Donuts is by far the better game.

Original comments:
I'm not crazy about the method of selection in this game.

Ironically, I acquired my PNP of Go Nuts for Donuts (GNfD) at about the same time I acquired this one.  GNfD shares much of its core with Crossing, but vastly improves the selection process.

I want to like this one, as I think there's room for simple games in my collection, especially as I intend to play it among 8-10 year olds.  It'll be interesting to see if they enjoy this one alongside GNfD.

Right now, my daughter prefers GNfD over this one.

I am undetermined on this one. It barely qualifies as a game night board game to me, more of a straight party game. I'll say that if your group likes it, it'll be a hoot. If not, they'll just say "why are we pointing at each other."

Very rarely do I get excited about a game just from reading the rules. It is even more rare that the game then delivers on its initial promises. Crossing fulfilled its promise and gave us a wonderful time. I really like double-guessing games, as well as those that involve and reward greed. It is hilarious to see greed pay off or bite you. This strips away a lot of fluff and you're left with a lean, streamlined machine that is easy to teach and accessible to all. A great surprise that I would highly recommend to anyone!

Good clean fun. Really simple party game which has a pointing mechanic to gather gems from mushrooms. If more than one person opts for the same mushroom, though, neither gets it. Any gems you gather go to your base, but be careful! you need to bank them, otherwise someone can just steal your stuff. 

The game is fast, furious and generally hilarious. It feels a bit like Incan Gold but with much simpler mechanics. And lots of pointing. Game should be called "Pointing" and not "Crossing."

Crossing is a fun quick game of deception and betrayal. Players are trying to bank as many gems as they can (with bonuses for simple sets). This is done by pointing at the set of gems you'd like either on one of the mushrooms or another players unbanked gems, but if you point to the same pile as someone else you get none. You can also instead hold you hand over your pile meaning they are protected as you are going to bank them. To do this you miss your next go. These all combine for a devious game when you are constantly trying to go for a pile of gems no one else will want while banking at the right time. Good stuff.

High luck, low strategy, and some laughs with the right crowd. My go-to bar games are Skull and Ghost Blitz, but I'm happy to have this option for folks who don't enjoy bluffing or speed, and are still intimidated by strategy.

This is a game I bought not for me, but for certain audiences. Looking forward to playing this at Thanksgiving with my niece and parents!

I also love the art style, and appreciate the representation of female characters.

For a kids game, this one is simply amazing. I've never seen my daughter so involved in a game - it was both hilarious and touching! A simple affair, which is great - 15 minutes of very straightforward gameplay - but all the psychology behind the mechanics... well, it's what makes "Crossing" great! Let's get it straight: this game is 95% psychology and 5% strategy, but it's the psychology that makes it unpredictable and tense.

Very light, bluffing, social, fun game. No deep strategy to be found here although I guess you can work out what colour jewels are most important to your score and then go for those but the game is so light I can't be bothered to do this. It's the kind of game I am happy to just play without being concerned about winning! It's a simple mechanism of 3,2,1 point at what you want. Feels like a stripped down Cash n guns - and that is a good thing!

RATING: 6
Crossing is in the same vein and Sneaks and Snitches, but even quicker, and with less convoluted rules. In this case, the simplified concept works to the game's advantage. While Crossing isn't really my kind of game, I do like it better than Sneaks and Snitches because it feels more in tune with what it's trying to be -- a simple and slightly goofy game about out-guessing your opponents. Even better, as a kid/family game, I think Crossing has some potential.

When playing Crossing, you'll find a bunch of mushroom cards in the middle of the table. On each mushroom is a random selection of gems that come in three primary colors -- plus a special fourth that is clear. The object of the game is to collect complete sets of colored gems. For each set of three you complete, you score five points at the end of the game. Clear gems score two points on their own. Finally, unmatched colored gems score one point each.

After setup, someone counts down from three. Then everyone frantically points at one of the mushrooms in the middle of the table. If you're the only one to point at a particular mushroom, you collect all its gems. If someone else is also pointing at your mushroom, neither of you collect anything. Place any gems you collect on the character card in front of you.

And here's where things get nasty. On subsequent rounds, you can point at someone's character card -- or, if you have gems on your own card, you have the additional option of covering your card. If someone points at your unprotected card, they steal your gems (all of them!). However, if you cover your card, not only are your gems protected, but you get to move them off to the side, permanently protecting them for the rest of the game.

Keep playing round after round until all the gems are gone. Then add up points.

You can probably see the similarities to Sneaks and Snitches. What I like about Crossing, by comparison, is its attitude. No cards to play. No extra rules about snitches or loot or anything else. Just collect gems (if you can). And you're pointing! Arms fling across the table. Sometimes you bump into the other players and realize you're competing for the same thing. There is a physicality to the game that feels appropriate for a game of this weight. It's still just a guessing game, though, and so I can't really recommend Crossing... unless...

Unless...

Perhaps you're looking for a diversion, or perhaps you have kids. Or perhaps you like to get goofy on game night from time to time. In that case, yep, then I can get behind Crossing because it knows what it is, and it doesn't muck up the works with anything beyond the delight of ridiculous guessing.

Crossing is a fairly simple game that's a ton of fun. In a four player game there's three gem pile spots. Empty spots are filled with two gems each and spots that have gems get an additional gem. then players count to three and point. Any spot that multiple players point to is disputed and can't be taken. Any spot that a single player pointed at goes to that player... including the pile in front of someone else. Alternatively a player can cover his own stash, which banks them so that they can't be stolen, but that means he sits out the next round.

A set of three colors scores 5 points. Unmatched colors are worth a point each. Diamonds are worth two points each (but there's only six of them while there's 18 each of the three colors of gems).

This is a game where we were laughing almost immediately. It was a ton of fun. Luckily there's a copy in my group now.

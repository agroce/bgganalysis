RATING: 7
Great game for adults to play with kids, probably age 6 and up. Little kids can play this themselves, although there is some basic addition/subtraction in the scoring phase that they might need help with. It's a quick play, with a good variety of game dynamics (simultaneous placement of pieces, bidding, puzzle-solving, "ship"-building, basic math in scoring). It has just enough strategy to keep adults interested while still having enough luck and easy skill challenges for kids to compete and have fun.

Boot samenstellen en vullen.
Dit door asap mannekes te zetten op de elementen die je wil hebben.  Zet je evenveel mannekes als iemand anders, dan krijg je niets.
Daarna nog biedronde.

Tijdens het spel kan je absoluut niet volgen wie goed bezig is.  De puntentelling is chaos en duurt veel te lang.

Absoluut niet voor kids vanaf 8 jaar, maar ook niet voor mij.

If you need something for the family that wo'nt bore the more trained gamers around the table, I think this Piratoons is just pitch perfect!

Solid game that does the Galaxy Trucker speed building phase well.  You rapidly place meeples trying to gain majorities on pieces before a timer runs out.  The goal is to build a pirate ship with a bit of set collecting.  Interesting game but it won't blow your socks off.

Build your ship and hire a crew. Everybody places his workers on the pieces he likes, when times runs out, if a player yells stop, the bidding is over! then expand your ship untill you have the best ship of them all. Very fun family game! with a beautiful design!

8 rounds of 15 second gameplay, in between each round 3 minutes bookkeeping.  15 minutes of convoluted scoring at the end.

Add to that
- a wonky "time" mechanics, which is a recipe for a lot of arguing and fighting ("I was first", "you didn"t place that meeple before I said stop", ...)
- if one player uses a "block others" + "speed" strategy, the game breaks.

Nice production values, but I don't believe this was given blind playtesting (without designer, rules explainer, company representative, ... present).  Give this to 4 kids (or to 4 male competetive gamers - which is almost the same thing) without someone else in the room (so they don't need to keep quiet) and I guarantee that friendships will be destroyed.

Second worst game played at Essen 2015, after the "eating with chopsticks" game.

This game would immediately be 50% better if they increased the timer length AND only scored for matching (i.e., no negative scoring). Granted I'm no fan of real-time games but, unlike Galaxy Trucker, this just punishes you (almost) arbitrarily and without the fun.

Game itself is ok. Scoring system is horrendous and takes about half the amount of actual game time. Dutch rules are pretty bad, certainly for Belgian designers.

Piratoons is a light family pirate ship building game, borrowing from the ship building of Galaxy Trucker. The game is shorter and lighter but seemed to work better in theory than in practice.

Real-time meeple placement isn't for me, and the ship-building/scoring is a bit too complex compared to the rest of the game.

This game feels like a party game with euro game features.
Great looking and feeling material.

Seems like this game was inspired by [thing=144415][/thing], but the designer must have thought, he could make a (much) lighter version of it.

Really great realtime auction game!
One of the weirdest combinations you could imagine to work well!

Each round goes by so fast, it feels like there's 5 seconds to think. Some really hectic battles over the resources are bound to happen. There's also a surprising amount of depth and bluffing in the post-realtime leftover blind auction.

All in all, a great and fun game!

Lightweight reaction game with a pirate theme. Don't let your boat grow too fast or you might end up with too many unfilled parts. You don't need to take this one too seriously but there might be some discussion about people knocking down someone's meeple from the tiles...

Simply not my kind of game, especially the details of matching the symbols when expanding your ship is too hard to fugure out while also having to put down your meeples.

A game that was recently put up for pre order and I wanted to try since I had the chance. It is a semi speed game to place pirates on ship parts and crew and try to be the single most to acquire it for your ship. You want to collect sets and there is a whole bunch of different scoring. It is a nice quick game. I would have loved it as a kid. Some harsh rules which you and modify easily enough. I very much enjoyed this game!

Real time game of building your ship and adding tiles to it to score some VP. Comparable with Galaxy Trucker only as a genre. But so many issues with the game, there are too many symbols to look out for, and as a round typically ends in 15 seconds or so, mostly you are going for random tiles. Then auction rules, if the highest auction ties then they cancel each other out and the next highest wins. And then the knocking down rule, you place usual size meeples on small square tiles, of course you will knock something down.

Great game, we took this game with us to Zuiderspel 2015 (a board game event in the Netherlands with 1500 people) and dozens of families tried it! Great fun! Takes less than 10 minutes to explain, great artwork and great fun with the entire family!

An odd little speed bidding game where it felt as though it was intentional that the scoring was a little opaque and complicated for the time that it took to play.

It resulted in a moderately interesting game that I don't honestly know who I would play it with again.

Gateway live simultaneous auction game to build the biggest pirate ship that is the most decked out.  Clever auction board to flip and reveal random ship tiles and accessory tiles for your ship. Each timed round place crew meeples on tiles to claim with a majority.  I like the undercut rule where ties cancel out and a lower bid can take the tile. Charming art work, several scoring options encourage balanced ship building and judicious use of empty spots on the ship. Add set collection bonuses and keeping watchful eye of your opponent's building needs make this a light fun and engaging family game.

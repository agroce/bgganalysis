One of my all time favorite games but still has your classic SPI problems.  Poorly written rules that leave the design half baked.  Completely worth the effort in my opinion.  We played these WWIII games to death in the 70s and they remain a strong part of my gaming heritage.

Superb ground system really gives the ability to the Soviets to push their attacks to the limit. The air & naval systems are a bit clunky and cry out for being tinkered with - possibly borrowing from Gulf Strike. An excellent game!

Rated 10 for nostalgia, but drops a point as its footprint means it gets very little table time, and I've decided to limit a rating of 10 to my top ten games.

Survived a cull of my games some 15 years ago as big and complex - but felt good and one day I might have the time and space.  Managed a solo campaign until I ran out of time - WP got stuck on northern and central front and then tried a flanker via Austria.

I do wonder, in the light of the post Cold War knowledge about the WP's true abilities (especially the allied forces)if they would come out weaker, but they would still a challenge to NATO. And the two big moral questions - use chemicals and/or nukes and destroy West Germany to save it - would still be there.  In the end the lure of the market place beat the lack of time and space.

I played this through twice in team play- and found it wanting despite being a big fan of SPI designs in general. I thought it failed to "get it right" in several areas, both mechanically as a game, and as an analysis tool for the times.

RATING: 6
Boxed. SPI monsters have a lot in common. This is playable but you do have to invest the time and recruit the team to do it. My club gets 4-8 people and 2 week ends (a lucky couple to host and set up!) The OOB is pretty dated now being ~1970. Haven't played it since the 80s (wow, that long!?!)

A solid monster that set the standard for covering a future NATO/Warsaw Pact conflict.  Aged in artwork and counters by todays standards it is still a solid game to play.  I've rated it an 8 but I'm sure some nostalgia is affecting that.

Despite being an SPI fan who was, at the time, most interested in WWIII games, I could not "grok" these rules. Why, oh why, were there no "how-to-play" videos?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my all-time favorite games.  Incredibly rich and detailed. High degree of realism for an operational level simulation.  You could feel the desperation and sense of overwhelm when playing the NATO side.  Takes a long time to set up and play.  Bought a second copy back in the 80's after my cat damaged the map.

RATING: 6
We had a lot of fun with this game - but there were a lot of rules problems and in the end, the game mechanics just seemed to not be very fun. I enjoyed the game NATO a lot more - not because of the reduced complexity, scale - I wish NATO had the air units, etc - but the streamlined rules played much better.

Monster!  Ziplock edition.  "Grognards only need apply."  Rating reflects fond memories of those "younger days".  Reagan was in power when I played it in the early 1980s and it all seemed possible (rather than just hypothetical) back then. I recall we generally agreed, based on assessment of units destroyed and "position", who won rather than play to completion.  Takes a bit of effort to get on top of this detailed system ... elements of which (must have) fed into the Central Front (SPI) series.  Never got into the naval (Baltic only) game myself ... the air game itself was complex enough.  Needs to be revisited.  Does a brisk trade on eBay ... which seems to indicate that complex hex-games are still in demand.  At end of day the GDW Third World War series/system worked better for me.

My favorite: WWIII - Operational - Medium

I know this game has few issues (terrain and map lack detail which occasionally results in non realistic tactics for armor and airborne units, also the Autobahn and movement ratings have some oddities), but which game does not have issues?

The rules have also some issues and you can tell it was probably rushed to completion).

Nevertheless, it is a game from 1978 and the concept and scale are BRILLIANT! The air rules seem great and integrated attack / movement set the start for GBACW and other games (like Against the Reich).

Time to get out the Elton John, Duran Duran and The Human Leage cd's, dig in and goodbye world. If you won't hear from this chap for a while, you know why.

I LOVE this game.

I've spent many hours playing this gargantuan effort.  Naval rules are tedious to the point of unplayability, and the air system is an abstract mess.  The land system is actually rather good, but as it's clearly not been adequately playtested, if you've any intention of getting deep into this game, it will fall over before you do.  The combat results table has a mathematical flaw that also serves to spoil the party.

One of the few games I bought used. I don't think I ever got past Turn 1, resolving 2 or 3 combats would take most of an evening once everyone called in their air support, flak was calculated and so on. But it's great just to look at. It's a pity SPI never was able to issue supplements updating the air units and other more date-sensitive aspects of the game. You have to love a game that includes units for Luxemburg -- and Liechtenstein!

James Dunnigan used to put so much effort into researching & creating these monster games that they were really like a commentary on the military & political issues of the day rather than a playable game & in that context, this was one of his best. The time commitment makes it hard to play anything other than the shorter scenarios without the optional rules.

My first SPI game, bought when I was a HS freshman for the whopping sum of $35 (by my mother!).  I could never find anybody crazy enough to play against, but I played the hell out of it solitaire.  As I recall the naval game didn't work, the CRT was quite irrational, and NATO (pre M-1's and Leopard II's) didn't have much of a chance, outside of nuking everything.  Traded 10 years ago, unfortunately, and rather missed.

One of my all time favorites. Oneof two best Operaitonal level systems in my opinion.  Great realistic feel. Odd CRT troubles some,as resutsl amy be coutner inttuitve in some situations and as it  does not allow you to successfully factor count to get prime results every time .. a plus in my opinion. NOt difficult to learn,but difficult to master and play well. Challenging. Many difficult decisions to make. Notonly ned to plan well, but go on the fly when plan falls apart.

When I was a teenager (along time ago...)I used to play this alot. BUT it does take along time. I would go to a friends and we would play for 2 days solid with only 6 hrs sleep..so say 30 -36 hrs gaming and we'd get about 3 turns done !!

But now it can be played without a conscience.(if I only had the time)
Still looks great, and is very different to most other WG's. Naval game is a waste of time side issue. The Air portion is great fun.

You need alot of table to play on. Still have a hanckering to return to it.

RATING: 8
This is truly a game I love, massive complexibility and sheer size make it probably unplayable in anything other than scenario level.  But if somebody offered me the time to play one monster game to the finish, it would be this one.  it actually seemed quite scary in the 80's because the warpact could be an unstoppable juggernaut.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you're using the original CRT (you shouldn't), don't attack at 5:1 odds, unless you're in a BANZAI mood. The 5:1 column gives much higher losses for the attacker and slightly higher losses for the defender than the 4:1 column.

Massive!  Complete and utterly amazing Cold War relic.  If the Balloon had ever gone up, this game would have been tied to it.  Every nation is represented.  Rules are clear and laid out well.  Combat is straightforward with minimal cross-referencing.  Players have many options available to them with varying levels of escalation possible.

Actually used to play this a lot in 1980's. Sadly not found anyone to give it a go since.

Monster wargame.

Really good overall for a game of its size and age, but those charts are a bit of a mess. I'm probably going to do my own version of them with errata and perhaps some further corrections (since there are indeed statistical anomalies in some places) as soon as possible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rating is more of a wish to play that play experience. Worked through the Solitaire Berlin Scenario. Many rules gaps despite a lot of errata. Rules layout, especially for all the combat modifiers, is almost painful. (Questions: 1) Can Support Units move independently to Combat Units and then move with it, keeping track of its movement points separately? 2) Do Artillery Support Units not stacked with Combat Units accrue 'Movement Points' when supporting? 7.16 errata says no but that makes no sense. 3) Rules state that 'Movement Points' are accrued when attacking in a ZOC, but cities have no ZOC; attacks cannot be for 'free' so use the normal with ZOC values?

CRT needing fixing from massive DR mods to column shifts to be more mathematically/probabilistically consistent. Have a hardcopy of this somewhere, done when I was a grad student (before PC's).

But I do want to play this if I can find an opponent.

This was only SPI "monster" game that I ever played.  Back in the early 1980's, my college buddy and I played the complete campaign game (minus the naval action) during a spring break.  We played virtually non-stop for three days, pausing only to get some food and sleep; at the end of the session, my buddy, I, the NATO forces and Ruskie hordes were exhausted.  The Warsaw Pact (my buddy) had to deploy chemical agents to blunt the NATO counter-attack and the game was essentially a draw because, while NATO had recovered most of West Germany, NATO was too depleted to rout the Warsaw Pact but their forces were just as decimated.

It wasn't an easy game, but I don't remember the rules being overly complex.  It was a tense game and the advantage would swing back-and-forth NATO and the Warsaw Pact.  Over-all it was a good game.

When the game came out, I was impressed by the detail in the unit ratings.  I thought the graphics in the map were good, too.

This was a great favorite & my first monster. Played many times. A memory of the campaign game played over a quarter of a century ago - French & Belgian Divisions disappearing into a massive chemical cloud in central Germany, never to be seen again - still one of my most resonant gaming memories. The commando, SAM, ECM & helicopter rules were all excellent.

This is a visually stunning game, with a tragically flawed combat system. Nothing like attacking NATO forces at 1:4 odds with a Soviet Motor Rifle Division ... and driving the NATO troops all the way back to France. But attack at between 1:2 and 2:1 odds and you won't win! Bizarre oversight. That said, if someone can fix the CRT, this is a magnificent beast to own and play.

RATING: 7
A fast, compact game, and a rare pick-a-character game without the paper-rock-scissors problem.  The game plays in real time, though -- there are no turns, and you can play cards as fast as you draw them, whether your opponent's moved or not.  Because of that people tend to love it or hate it.  Try (a few times) before you buy.

RATING: 8.5
Strikes a good balance between a game that plays in under a minute, rewards both fast reflexes, but still, especially with the second set, can be won merely by outthinking. Loses points for the necessity of learning your opponent's deck to be able to play effectively.

Tough game to master the mechanics, but the concept and uniqueness of the game makes me want to play it a few more times, preferably in a group/tournament setting. It's hard to get a "feel" for each combatant unless you spend a lot of time and a lot of sessions.

A revelation of a game - simply outstanding! 

If you don't like 'reflex' games, which test your mental computation speed as well as how fast you can move your hands, you will hate it and say 'it's not a Proper Game'. However, if you relish these skills and are sick of placing tiles, making tactical hand-based decisions, moving figures round a board, etc you will love the breath of fresh gaming air that is Brawl.

It is ridiculously fast, furious, clever-yet-basic, hilarious, tense and fun. The definitive 'blast' of a game.

Finally got to play real-time, and yes, this is a fun little game. And it's even playable in turn-based mode, which is a fancy trick for a real-time game. A fun filler game, but it lacks a few vital parts for a filler: it is basically a two-player game, and it takes a while to explain.

Quick, plays in mere seconds.  It's unfortunate that this game is out of print.  I was lucky to be able to get my hands on a few decks at a local shop (the owner had to crawl around in a dusty attic and I'm pretty sure he visited at least 3 different castles up there just to find the 2 decks).  As such I've been forced to rely on the internet to find a card list for the decks and make my damned own.  

Every single person I've played this game with was instantly addicted, and all I can tell them is "Make your own damn Brawl decks - get your paws offa mine!"

I got this on an impulse and it was just meh. It was fun to play a few times with a buddy, between games or at the end of the night to wrap up, but either we played it wrong or it just wasn't deep enough to satisfy long term.

6 Deck Brawl Set: Bennett, Chris, Darwin, Hale, Morgan, Pearl

Wow! How is it possible that so few people know about this game? It's amazing. There's not much to it, but it feels like the classic card game "Speed" that I used to play as a child, but brought to a whole new level. The interesting decisions come out in what deck to play against your opponent after they've beat you a couple times in a row. The decks really do feel completely different and make for a different experience. Get the word out: Brawl is amazing!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The first problem is that Blink is a way better speed game. The second problem is that most of the game is meaningless, since most of the scoring cards you play will simply get wiped. It is perhaps for this reason that I don't feel invested in the game giving me little care for the outcome.

RATING: 8
When you want a "real-time" card game this is your best bet.  For about $5 for a deck of cards (you need two to play) you can really get some milage from your money.  The game is very easy to learn and teach, but VERY difficult to master and a word of warning to the older people reading this - the younger you are the better you seem to do.  A great game to kill some time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Strategy is key to this game, especially as knowing what cards your opponent (and yourself!) have yet to play.  Most people forget one can play on your opponent's side of the field, forcing their play.  Real-Time is fun, but not for everyone, and PLEASE teach people in training (turn-based) mode a few times BEFORE unleashing real-time on them. :)

I recently unearthed these in a closet at my folks place and it brought back a lot of good memories. I really enjoyed collecting the first set of characters and playing with friends in early high school.

I recall this game taking more time to clean up than play, but it wasn't a detriment to the experience, where you could easily play 10 times in half an hour. With a comparably skilled opponent, sessions were nice and competitive. There was good balance in the first set, though I have to admit, my interest withered in response to Phil Foglio's awful looking second ed. characters. So I have no idea if they were a good addition overall. 

Now that I rediscovered these, I'll definitely add them to my larder or more mature games. If anything as an easy distraction between long game turns, or elimination matches.

Recommended if you can appreciate a shallow, though fun, quick and dirty card game, especially if you can get the first 6 characters inexpensively.

(As of [b]8+[/b] plays) A real-time card game that provides a few minutes of fast-paced entertainment in between other activities or when no one feels like thinking very much. The original set is the best, with the fussy special abilities added in later sets only serving to unnecessarily complicate the simple gameplay. I have more or less lost my taste for it after playing it repeatedly in college.

This is one of the most fun games to play in under two minutes. There are about a dozen different non-collectible decks, each with its own playing style. Brawl's rules are easy to learn, but the game is brutal -- especially with more than two players. It's real-time, so those who prefer to think about their moves will most likely be extremely frustrated with its fast-paced intensity. Brawl is the perfect mental cleanser between longer games.

[Hand Management, Real-time, Fighting] {2P:9} (So far played the three Catfight decks, half of the Foglios and Ting Ting.) This is easily the best of all the James Ernest games I've ever played, by a very large margin. I'm going to eventually review this game. For now, I'll just say that Brawl provides a huge adrenalin rush. It's intense and yet intelligent, fast and yet thoughtful. In many ways, playing it reminds me of my early lessons in martial arts. Lash out blindly and you'll get your ass kicked. Lose your cool and your head will come back on a platter. It's really deceptive - at first blush you think it's a random  kiddie game. It's not. Brawl has depth in its structure and gameplay that the 35 cards of each character don't instantly convey. In its current state, ending with the Catfight block and not including the extraneous one-shots with the wild cards, Brawl's complexity is right where I think it should be. I don't like the wilds - they detract from the thoughtfulness and the strategy of the game. Yes, the card draw is random, but the deck is  only 31 cards, and you have your stack to manage. Sometimes the rhythm of your deck may be off due to a freaky shuffle, but this is rare and should never surprise you. Your deck composition is known, and certain decks like Mischo and Tamiya are dominant in a card color and type anyway. The randomness of the card draw is a non-factor in playing Brawl. Finally, no, speed isn't necessarily a factor. Some decks work well with a slower, more deliberate playing style, and they can beat a straightforward deck with a frenetic player. (I must admit that I am a slow player by comparison to most others, preferring to lose bases and then implement clears, doubles, nulls and reversals at the last minute.) The object isn't who freezes the bases, it's who's got the most bases at the end of the game. In a pinch, it's sound strategy to play for the draw. Hold, Reverse, Double, Clear and Null, plus a little patience are your friends. Oh, and the cards are of surprising quality - much better than what I'd expect from Cheapass Games. [Current favorite deck: Crane] {Still wanting to acquire Alex, Rent, Tess, Ting Ting, and maybe some of the first edition decks.} *** UPDATE: Despite a rather low level of play because my gaming group doesn't like this kind of thing as much as I do, Brawl remains a brilliant design and holds its lofty place among my list of best games. I'd love a set of "deckbuilding" cards with common backs and the whole menu of effects to choose from. As it is I'm constrained to building custom decks out of my Catfight cards. Meow.

Brawl is a cute real-time fighting game. I'm not usually a fan of (nor a challenge in) that sort of games but Brawl is good fun nevertheless, mostly because it isn't just about brainlessly slapping down cards the fastest. There is a good deal of interaction between the different cards, providing ways to annoy your opponent with clever plays, and even if things don't work out the fight is over after a minute or two. For a very quick match every now and then, this is pretty good stuff.

I love this where so many hate it: a real-time fighting card game, where you put card down as fast as you can turn them up. Oddly abstract (you're trying to win two of three "bases" in the centre but can constantly reset them), it works when you understand that the fight is between the brains of the players.

A friend had 30 minutes and wanted to play a game.  After teaching the rules and playing one practice round (taking turns, not real-time), we managed to get in five full games.  Very, very fast and exciting.  I love it, even though I typically lose.

My rating maxed out after a session of [b]many[/b] games with several deck combinations.  I know of no other game that provides this much action, excitement, and laughter.  I eventually got one of every published deck, and I would never refuse a game of Brawl.

RATING: 6
A fantastic "real-time" card game, and the best one that Cheapass has made (Falling, Fightball, Light Speed are others).  ButtonMen without dice.  Players decks represent a character in a fist-fight with another.  Decks include offensive and defensive moves, as well as occasional "special" attacks.  Games take about 30 seconds, so these fights are much more realistic than the ones you see in movies that take 15 minutes!  The illustrations and design of the cards are first rate.  The mechanics are elegant, fast and simple.  After one "slow" play of the game it's pretty much picked up.  

It's not a collectible card game per se, but each deck is tweaked slightly (representing different fighting styles) and there are I think 10-12 available.  My favorite decks are the six Club Foglio ones which were illustrated by Phil Foglio, one of my favorite artists.  These games are probably the best "filler" games imaginable because they're quick and can scale for 2 or 3 players.

If I'm to play games that are real time, I can't think of a better game then say speed or spoons, both of which can be played with a deck of cards.  This requires a bit of buy in if you want to have the collection of decks.  

Anyways, this is a neat game to kill some time in between other games, but I wouldn't really say "Vinci?  Nah, I'd rather play some brawl!"

I love this game, but only the vanilla version with the original decks.  The Club Foglio stuff and the other things only mess it up in my opinion.  I guess I should only speak for Club Foglio, since that's the only variation I played. Anyway, it's a really fun and fast-paced game, but if you want to teach someone how to play it, you better lose at least the first ten times or they'll get frustrated and not play with you anymore.

This is a real time card game, which is interesting in theory. In practice it is chaotic and light on decision making (which didn't stop me from making poor choices).

A wholly unique gaming experience, which is more than I can say the vast cardboard mass of proprietary card games I've tried.  There is a lot I like about this game: the real-time decision making and the fact that the decks require different playing strategies are high on the list.  I have only the Catfight decks.  I intend to pick up the other seven that are currently available, and maybe even the original six.  I'll stand pat on my 7 rating now but I think this may go up if I can find a regular sparring partner.

This game is fast and furious and kind of reminds me of Falling (Another Cheapass game). The gameplay so far seems to be very single minded, in the sense that you have to play from your gut instinct and sometimes one little bad decision can cost you. Fun game, buy it if the price is right. The multiplayer scenario seems a little too chaotic to play since you have to split your focus between your left hand opponent and your right hand opponent.

really cool real-time game that has nothing to do with fighting. Some interesting decisions to be taken; speed matters, but not as much as other real-time games. At 60 seconds (or less) per game, it's very difficult to resist "just another one".
I like the fact that there is no "resolution" phase at the end of the game (eg. Fightball and Light Speed) where the players have to go through the stacks that were played and figure out who won -- which in some cases can take much longer than the game itself. None of that crap in Brawl.

A good, light 'real time' card game.  I think my biggest gripe with this game is that I'm just not the biggest fan of real time games in general.  However, I don't dislike the (admittedly small) genre, and when I'm in the mood for something along those lines this definitely hits the spot, plus its short playlength can make it good filler material.

RATING: 8.5
Absolute gem of a game. It just stands out in board/card game design. It's played realtime and it works surprisingly well in that mode. There's enough variety to both cards and tactic and it's far frome "just drawing and playing". Good player will win most of the time. Average game lasts about 30s... then quick card gather, reshuffle and ... go again. It's tons of fun, every time. I can play this for hours and never get bored. It introduces an amazing new component of dynamic, pace and dexterity into a genre that is usually perceived as a slow cube pusher and massive thinking while leaning over the board. Not this one. It should be in your collection just to remind, how important and game-defining is a good idea for a game mechanic.

RATING: 7
I had fears this game would be too chaotic and simple for me and my group but after playing a few games, it became a really big hit. The game can feel abstract compared to most other fighting card games out there but it makes it a lot easier to teach players. There's surprisingly a lot of strategy for a game that takes about a minute to play.

fast, furious, original. The complexity is set just right to require some thought while also allowing fast play. Sometimes there'll be a mexican standoff, sometimes its a mad race, and often you just lose track of what's going on.  The Club Foglio decks with the Reverses are good fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love real-time card games.  Speed is an old favorite, so Brawl is a natural extension.  I start non-gamers with simple decks without many variations, and stand back as the pace picks up.  Single games go fast (usually less than two minutes!), so after people play a few rounds and get warmed up to how everything works we start playing best 2 out of 3 tournaments...  Highly energetic, frantic, quick decisions, or just fast gameplay...  It's half luck, half fast thinking, half chaos, half not-good-with-fractions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros:
- bright and colourful artwork, very true to the fighting game theme
- characters have distinct strength and weaknesses, you will probably find someone you can handle better than others
- real time play feels so incredible fitting in this but you still have the option to play "Training mode" with people who are not fond of it. Actually it feels almost like a second game using the same cards.
- easy to teach

Cons:
- quite a bit luck dependant and chaotic at times (but hey, for me that makes the fun of it :))
- real time play is not appealing to many people. Playing the  way the game was intended to play might be rare.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Brawl is great for a few short games here and there.  The game definitely favors people who are more familiar with it, and it's not the greatest for extended plays, but I find it quite enjoyable nonetheless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Brawl is an important type of game to me... a realtime game. Like the classic cardgame, "Spit!", played during lunch and study hall in high school, Brawl is a fast-paced "Do and React" card game. Light on strategy and high on fun -- my favorite combination in a board or card game. Every game round, I can feel good about losing, and surprised about winning, which is my most desired outcome in any game I play with others. This may have to do with how short a round of Brawl is... 30 to 60 seconds.

This is the game that endeared me to Cheapass Games and James Ernest's designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2009: 8. Really fun, chaotic card game to play in between heavier fair.  Games take less than a minute and are fast, furious fun. There's even a little bit a strategy in here, but if you pause too long to think about it, you may have already lost!

A corker!  Lots of fun, if a bit expensive to get considering that it's a pretty light game.  Furthermore, some decks, especially in the Club Foglio set, don't add too much variation.  But that's a small quibble based on the high price of the decks.  The game itself is extremely clever, elegant and fun.

Frantic fun, I prefer playing with the more basic decks. Some of  the more unusual cards just add confusion. [Of course it is possible that if I played this more I would become too familiar with the basic decks, and then would welcome the additional card types in some of the later decks.]

I've got the basic set, Bennet, Chris, Darwin, Hale, Morgan, and Pearl, plus Tess from Club Foglio.  Haven't played all that much (considering that it's an approx. one minute game), but I like Tess the best.  For the art, if nothing else. (Esp. the reverse card!)

I can see how this game could be quite a bit of fun.   In many ways, due to the fact that this is a real time game, this almost becomes a dexterity game, like the card game speed.  Plays tremendously quick, and allows for fun encounters between different characters.  There is a great mechanic where you need to manage your discard pile to play against your opponent more efficiantly.  What it boils down to though, really is who can play cards the fastest while thinking on your toes.  I personally am just way to slow to be competative at this game.  I imagine that it would be great fun for those that could keep up.

It's hard to turn down a game that can be played in 30 seconds.  Helluva lotta fun, that's for sure, and it's the perfect in-between game while waiting to start a new one, or even just waiting to take your turn in an already active game!  So what if the "fight" theme is rather tenuous -- I likes me some Brawl! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I haven't played a game quite like this one before.  Not something I'm yearning to play, but I won't turn a game down, especially since it's so fast it doesn't take away too much time from other games.  Not a deep game, but an interesting design.

[Cheapass Catfight (2001)] Nickie {Fighting; real-time, variable-player-power} {6.50 tournament, 7 team-tag } Brawl is a very enjoyable, exciting and fun real-time game. It requires attention, perception, speed and tactics. It's as fast and hectic as Speed but it even provides tactical options! It's even louder with a group of 6 players!

Beginners can use Alex, Chris and Morgan, who have a balance of attack and defense cards. In general, fighters may like Club Foglio decks more. Catfight is a little bit tricky; endurance and flexibility are needed to win. Tres and Crane are the most difficult characters for me to play.

The panic that sets in when your opponent starts churning through his cards as fast as possible to get to the end of the deck.  Priceless.

Very original and impressive game concept. The real-time format gives the great fighting experience. Smaller number of different cards, means quick learning curve. Character-based decks offers personalized play styles. Non-collectible nature means fewer expenditure. Short game time, a greater filler. Various fighting modes, even enable team play or multiplayer fight pit.
Understand your own personality, your strengths and weaknesses, and determine your own play style and tactics. Pick up an appropriate character deck and become the king of fight. Participate in both head-to-head, team fight, and multiplayer pit fight modes, for entirely different experiences.

I love Brawl.  It's extreme fast paced fun jammed into less than a minute. My only complaint is that the cards are hard to find.  This was the game that when I bought it at a convention, I declared to my friends that I was offically a gamer geek.  You do need a fair amount of room to play this game because of the cards being thrown off the table--also a small table is better than a big one, otherwise the cards in play can get confused with the cards that were discarded.

Although the game comes with multi-player rules, I enjoy it best with only two -- and the game definitely has a popcorn feel in that you can't stop with only one game.

Great quick fun, despite the fact that I&#039;m not quick enough to do well. Can be easily adapted for team play, or 3-or-more play, or one can add &quot;harmless fruit juice&quot; for fun. (That&#039;s called &quot;Drunken Brawl.&quot;)

I only own Chris and Hale, but will pick up more decks of this gem of a game. Even my wife likes it! (Although she wants to play Hale, and usually kicks my butt.)

The real-time aspect reminded me of War.  Harmless filler but not really for me.

This game's stupid.  And quick.  And a blast.  For fun to time ratio, Brawl can't be beat!

Love to watch my 8 yr old son get all excited about this game.  A ton of fun for what it is.

After 20+ Plays: If there's one thing cheapass games knows how to do, its realtime games.  This is a little more chaotic than [GAMEID=5534], but the scoring is much easier.

Fast, think speed fast, two player card game.  If you are not the type who likes split second decisions and movement you will not like this game.  If you are like me and like those things, or it you liked Falling you will like Brawl

Fast paced action.  I have several decks and I like the original 6 decks the most from what I have played.

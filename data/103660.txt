I really like a lot about this game, the mechanics, the semi-cooperativeness of it as well as the artwork.

RATING: 8.5
Wow, great design. I was caught by surprise when the last of the roasts triggered the end of the game. I had fun watching a roast degrade but ended up beating out a higher prioritized (via poker hand ranks) when it had nothing left but lower ranked beans.

RATING: 6
I have scored this higher than it would otherwise deserve, because it truly fills a niche: a serious strategy euro-game for 8 players. The components are fantastic (although colours are hard to differentiate). 

It is a hard game to teach. There are many disparate mechanics in the game, and lots of small rules which are easy to overlook. It is a kin to teaching a medium-weight eurogame, which is not a problem in itself, but when teaching to 6 or 7 other people all of whom are asking questions and talking over each other, it can be a bit of a chore. Especially when groups of that size are used to the short rules-explanations of a party game. (And we were using the simplest ruleset - the game offers multiple variants and advanced rules).

Once the game is up and running, the strategies are cleverly implemented and the negotiation starts to flow. This game can get loud with large player counts! I have only played it with 7 players - I know it is generally regarded as a poorer game with fewer than 6. 

I think this is a quality product through and through. It won't reach the table much due to needing high player counts, but I will look forward to my next play.

I've played a few times now with 6+ players and it just feels so uneventful. Blend nearly exclusively taken and I've never seen a blend less than full house. It's so easier to manipulate with Select and the skip one.

RATING: 7
Decent game!  It has some different elements to it, and it deserves credit for that.  The semi-collaborative building was fun.  The skill ladders were rough.  I really didn't like how close some of the colors for beans were...there were a couple of bad turns due to mistaken colors.  I'd play again, but probably won't buy it.

Brilliant game when playing 6 or more players. The negotiations and the bag-management system is super fun. If you are a coffee fan this is a must! If you are not a coffee fan, find someone to play it with, and after that you become a coffee fan.

Just got mine in the mail. WOW--beauuutiful components all around, wonderful roaster bags, gorgeous graphic design. I can't wait to get together some friends and play!

[UPDATED] 

BIG HIT! Everyone in our game group has had a wonderful time playing VivaJava. The theme is as fresh as newly ground coffee beans, and the strongly interactive gameplay proved as invigorating as a stiff cup of dark roast. The blending and research mechanics are really well-integrated and full of surprises, and the "bestseller" ranking system and "degrading" of the top roasts keep you on your toes. Jittery, even.

Components are thick, well-conceived, with sharp and clever graphic design choices that make the coffee theme that much more tasty.

The only gripe players had was some difficulty in distinguishing colors, primarily the dark red and brown beans. Easily solved by using a magic marker to draw a line down the red beans to make distinguishing them easy. 

Top marks all around--this is the most creative and enjoyable eurogame I've played in a long time. VivaJava as full of WIN as one's mug ought to be full of coffee!

This is the only game of its kind that doesn't bog down at this player count (except 7 wonders, but not everyone exists in eachothers' games in large 7 wonders games)

Some miserably tiny cardboard chits and some weird timing issues keep this from being higher, but I enjoyed it.

RATING: 7
VivaJava is a refreshing game, one that is a lot of fun and it brings a new kind of mix between competitive and cooperative strategies. I played a 3-player game which does not unveil the full potential, so I guess that after a few more plays in 6-8 the rating has the potential to grow.

The mechanisms of the game are not as well defined as in other games, the tech tree is not challenging and interesting enough, so the game shifts towards a party game. However, the "blending" part compensates for the things I did not like and I believe VivaJava remains a strong game, open to new gamers and enjoyable by experience players. It will for sure hit our table again quite soon.

The game lacks intrigue and tension with less than 7P. At 7P and 8P when there are often teams of 3 it becomes much more challenging (and more exciting) to produce a good brew. Not a mechanically deep game but truly unique.

Another KS game that sucked me in...complete with a whole Brewple set.  

*addendum* We finally learned it - a rollicking good time!  8's great; haven't tried with fewer, but I think 7 would be the least I would require for numbers.

First play: demo at Essen 2012. I'd read the rules and suspected that there was alot of randomness but on line feed back reassured me that was almost negated by research which will redress the balance. Having played I'm afraid that just plain isn't the case. The two extremes of luck were experienced in our games with players fluking perfect scores against the odds and others who failed to achieve anything but the lowest grade blend.

Production could do with less tiny fiddly counters and microscopic numbers. one player couldnt read some details at all. Way way too random for me. Not to be bought or ever played again.

I really good game that will seat a larger group of players.

Had a lot of fun with this one. 

It is a bit fiddly for the amount of bits and administrative functions.  The games suggests a "brewmaster" to keep track of them.  I would suggest instead that players are assigned the tasks (which are really quite simple) to do, and have the game flow a bit smoother!

RATING: N/A
2012. Best w/7-8p. Kickstarter. A social/negotiation/deal-making game because you create teams with other players to make the best brew and share points.  Another mechanic is memory (or bluffing) since you may not know exactly what beans an opponent has in his bag, but some argue that it's to your advantage to be open/honest to make the best deals/teams.  The game has some "prisoner's dilemma" elements going on.  Sometimes it can be hard to join up with the same person over and over because eventually you want to surpass him in points.

Others say: It is much more of a political game than a euro.  You should approach it as a social game because making deals with other players is very important to the enjoyability factor.

The rest of the world may have their copies, but I still await mine.  However, until that glorious day comes when my face lights up as my VivaJava package arrives, I have the memories and splendor of brewing, researching, and creating delightful aromatic coffee blends as I roast my way to victory or defeat.

RATING: 8.5
It's a kickstarter, and on the surface appears to be a social/party game... but underlying this cutie is a medium weight euro that's actually consistent with its theme, and also emphasizes the high interaction so often absent in heavier euros, plus the cooperative/competitive element that makes a certain type of game so fun. Many many opportunities, for working together or alone, piggybacking, screwage, and putting on bets. In fact, the betting aspect reminds me of Manila & Stone Age, only here there is (surprise!) no dice! Although, coming from Dice Hate Me games, it should be no surprise. Reading your opponents/ collaborators/ friends well is at the heart of this game, and so is calculating your odds rationally & playing a good poker game.

I actually played the VivaJava dice game first, which I am a big fan of. This one is only okay. The rules are a little convoluted and hard to follow (and I say this as someone who has learned/played over 500 board games!), and the "draw-something-from-a-bag" mechanic is one of my least favorite mechanics in any game.

With that said, I feel like this would shine with lots of people, maybe five or six minimum. The best moments are when multiple players have to share in a blend, and root for each other as they draw. The problem is that the -1 and -2 PP spots on the board seem so punishing that people often don't want to collaborate at all. The interns often suck, especially if you aren't first or second player, so the game ultimately seems to offer few good choices on your turn, which is never a fun experience.

I want to like this game for the art/creative design alone, but nothing in this game is very elegant.  The co-op blending is interesting, but you can't keep up with the information enough to make informed decisions.  The research-to/from-points on the tiles and at the end of a research round renders the research aspect of the game too easy.  Everybody researches the same thing and there is no penalty for researching, as you roughly earn the same number of points as blending.  There isn't much angst there...I thought this game could have been simplified from the fiddly mess it really was to play.  Why not do away with the research boards (fiddly ridiculousness) and instead have unique techs that could be chosen if a research tile was taken by your pawn?  This game could have scaled back so much also.  All the coffee blends are the same (aside from inanely pre-printed helper beans on some which rarely serve their purpose). Why chunky tiles then? This game is all packaging with no flavor or substance...kinda like the mass-produced tar that people often mistake for coffee.

Not without its merits, but felt like a bit too much work for a light diversion and not enough oomph for a gamer's game. Go into it expecting Yahtzee, and you'll be pleasantly surprised. Go into it expecting Agricola, and you'll wonder where the game is. Apart from the unfortunate inclusion of both brownish red and reddish brown beans and the predictable headaches that ensue, the physical presentation of VivaJava is top-drawer -- one of the best-looking games I've played, ever.

RATING: 8
Strategic and Entrepreneurial, I like Viva Java because it gives the player a lot of choice with minimal randomness.  There are no dice, there are lots of decisions to be made. 

I also like the tactic of forced cooperation in which you must periodically choose partner(s) to work with, all while competing against everyone!

Viva Java is also a game that becomes more fun with more people involved, provided you don't mind waiting for your turn.  The downside is that there are lots of little pieces involved, which can make it a pain to keep track of everything. 

The game feels very balanced, it's hard for one person to walk away with a clear victory.  It has a fairly steep learning curve with lots of rules to cover, so this is a harder game to introduce to newbies unless everyone wants to invest 1-2 hours in a starter game.

I got this game at a board game flea market at the Congress of Gamers convention.  I really like The Great Heartland Hauling Co, which I think is by the same company, although not the same designer.  I wound up not liking it that much after a play and traded it away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Vivajava has the distinction of being one of the few Euro games that I actually would only want to play with a group of 5+ and which also seems well-designed to handle even its max scale of 8.

In short, players take turn gathering coffee beans that are put into their cloth bags. Where they gather puts them into a temporary partnership with one or more other players. That partnership can then opt to make new coffee roast combinations using poker combinations of like coffee bean colours. Good combinations put the roast high on the VP chart where it pays out points that can both win the game and be cashed in for special powers.

Even great coffee roasts won't stay on top of the VP charts forever though, as each of them is forced to lose 1 bean at the conclusion of each round insuring that new roasts ascend to the top of the charts.

Vivajava is a medium weight Euro with elegant mechanics and a nice, but not overly heavy-handed cooperation mechanic. There is some randomness inherent in the coffee bean pull, but there are a lot of ways to mitigate that and I'd say the randomness is perfect for the length and overall feel of this game. The game can hypothetically be played with less than 5 using dummy players but it seems that much of the interest, which comes from the cooperative blend making, would be blunted. 

Excellent game in its niche, I don't have the group that would justify owning this, but if I did I would definitely want one for my collection.

Un juego bastante interesante que mezcla eurogame y juego social (en el sentido de que invita a los jugadores a hablar entre ellos y formar equipos). Tiene una duración bastante ajustada y un margen de jugadores de 3 a 8. Preveo que lo jugaré bastante por lo original que es y lo fácil de explicar y comprender las reglas.
No ha gustado mucho en uno de mis grupos de juego pero en otro si. No obstante, me sigue pareciendo original la idea del juego y me gusta bastante.

Okay well, first, the limited beans encourages bean hording, so in our six player game we had only the three least good beans available as the rest were in the the bags. Second the punishment for being in the lead makes me wonder why I would try to make a good product, when I suffer not only the PP point reduction from the tile, but also the lack of beans.

This game looks like it might be really great with 6-8 players, when forced cooperation results in many less-than-perfect blends. The one time I played (with the interns), it was *way* too easy for people to get 5 of a kind. There were still plenty of meaningful decisions in the game, but the most engaging and interesting mechanic was toothless; I would turn down any future game of this with fewer than 6 players.

This is a gamer's party game for 4+ players. I couldn't get a group of gamers that big consistently enough. I do like how it encourages talking and negotiation on the part of everyone involved. A lot of party games discourage some or all players from talking (like Codenames, Hanabi) or allows some players to remain silent (like Resisitance or Werewolf type games).

Pretty neat and unique game. It mixes a lot of mechanics into a  nice blend. Seems to be very well suited for large player counts, only played it with 5 so not sure how different it is. It feels very thematic and it has a nice negotiation aspect to it. I can see why a lot of people rate it so high.

It was a nice experience to play but I don't see myself wanting to play this game very often. Once in a while when the mood is right :).

Note: Unfortunately BGG ranking doesn't let me give the rank granularity I want for this game. While is more than an OK game (it is a great game!), it is a game that I would play once in a while if in the right mood.

RATING: 6.5
Best thing about this game is it fills the game-that-plays-well-with-more-than-five-and-not-too-long niche. Players are collecting various colors of beans and trying to (cooperatively, in some sense) fill orders for points. There are also some technology tracks, so this offers some level of variation to one's strategy from game to game. The colors were difficult to discern at times, even for players who aren't color blind.

Unique semi-cooperative game of set collection. Not quite deckbuilding/bag building since the bag ends up serving more as a randomizer instead of dice or cards. The rest of the game borrows from other games with tech trees. Components are cool.

VivaJava has some fresh ideas (mmmm, fresh coffee), and I'm looking forward to playing it again.  Actually, we never finished our game.  There were 8 people playing.  7 of us had never played before, and the person teaching had only played it once before, so learning the game and playing it went very slowly.  I'm tempted to say that I'll never play another strategy game with that many players.  We all decided to stop playing after a few rounds.  But it was interesting enough that I  want to try it again with fewer players.

Interesting 8 player games (not too many of those) with a bit of haggling and some interesting decisions, but that while it can be fun seems to have some fundamental failings.
First, I'm still unsure why so many Dice Hate Me games ends at 21 points (VJ, VJ:TDG, Brew Crafter Card Game, Compounded). While it's keeping the game short, in this and some of the aforementioned games, it makes them feel like you're just getting going when the game ends.
Second: there are some interesting decisions, mostly the big one which is what part of the board you will go onto and thus, which team you will join. 
Once that decision is taken, there's not much left to decide, really, which is a shame. There lots of good stuff in there, but I'd like a little more decisions with my social interaction.
I still like it and really want to try it with less players to see how the game changes, but so far, I'm unsure on how many times it will hit the table with the full complement of 8 players.

Written after 1 play of 7 players game:

In Vivajava, you are temporarily grouped into 3 teams (a team can be from 1-3 players) depending on which region you've sent your researcher (see the yellow round spot; that's the place for researcher). As a team, you get to discuss and then vote on whether you choose to brew or research as a team. 

[center][ImageID=1224724 inline][/center]

In the next round, you will be grouped again, but this time with different players (or the same). Your choice of where you choose to send you researcher is interesting because it may be because of the bean offered in the spot, the players who you would like to team up with who went there earlier (because he/she may have the right coloured beans), or to get the bonus token.

I find the game to be interesting and just amazed at how the game handles high player counts that good. I played a 7 players game, and it took us 2 hours (6 other players including me were new to the game).

I don't like too much negotiation (I played Diplomacy and Genoa) and the discussing/socializing part in [thing=41114][/thing] can sometimes turned me off (depending on the players). But with Vivajava, the negotiation is kept to minimum which I find it suit to my liking.

Note that this is a game that I think works best with 6-8 players though, so don't expect to get a good play with less players.

Kávéjáték.
Kávékeverékeket próbálunk előállítani, a világ kávéültetvényein termelt kv-kból.
A játékmenet:
1. Ültetvényere küldjük emberünk, aki begyűjti a kv-t. Vagy nem. Ugyanis van 3x3 ország: 3 kontinens, mindegyiken 3 ország, és mindegyiken van egy országkorong, ami pozitív vagy negatív dolgot is adhat: a pozitív lehetőség, a negatívat kötelező végrehajtani, és persze mindegyik országhoz tartozik egy kávészem is. A kvszemek típusa változik -pontosabban változhat a következő fordulóra, azaz nem fix hogy melyik országban mi terem.
Egy országot egy játékos választhat. Illetve 5-6 fő esetén az országkorongok nem mindegyike van képpel felfelé, mindig van lefelé is: ott se plusz, se mínusz dolog sincs: és kvbab sincs. és nem is lehet idetenni bábut, kivéve pár spec akcióval.
A begyűjtött -alapban 1 db- kvszem a pörkölőjébe kerül a játékosnak. Lehet több is: vannak ugyanis kutatássávok (lásd alább), amiken előre haladva ez módosulhat.
2. kontinensenként csoportot alkotnak a játékosok. és a csapatok mindegyike külön külön eldönti, h keveréket állít elő, vagy kutat. Megbeszélik, majd szavazás. egy csapatban max 3-an lehetnek: ha 3-an, szavazat többség. 2-nél, ha nem egyeznek a szavazatok, akkor kutatni kell.
Majd a megszavazott dolgot végrehajtja az egész csapat.
Ha kutatás: mindenki kap 3 Kutatáspontot, amit elkölt szabadon a saját kutatássávjain. 5 kutatássáv, mindegyik más dolgot erősít. Mindegyik 4 oszlopból áll, és az új oszlopba lépés ad új tulajdonságot. egy oszlopon belül 2-3 lépést kell tenni, mire a másikba jut a jelölő. A kutatássávokban előrehaladásért a játék végén pont is jár.
Kutatássávok: van rendes nevük, és tematikájuk, de ezt most lusta vagyok felidézni, amiket adnak: az egyikkel több kvbab vehető fel, a másikkal a pörkölőt lehet selejtezni, a harmadikkal befektetést eszközölhet a játékos -beszáll mások keverékébe- , a negyedikkel a rosszhúzást lehet félretenni, az ötödik aromakártyákat ad.
Persze ezek is erősödnek ahogy egyre jobban előrehalad a játékos s sávon.
Ha keverés: akkor a csapat minden tagjának legalább 1 kvszemmel hozzá kell járulnia. Ez a játékosok pörkölőiből lesz húzva, azaz itt szerencsefaktor, de mivel tudja a játékos mit gyűjtött, tudja milyen esélyekkel húzhat. Illetve a kutatássávok közül 2 is segíti ezt a húzást. (Persze ha eléri a játékos). A sorrendet -mármint h melyik játékos húz előbb- eldönthetik, ha nem tudnak megegyezni, akkor játékos sorrend szerint (a pontlistán hátulról haladva.)
Illetve egy játékos akkor hagyja abba a húzást, amikor akarja - utána viszont többet nem húzhat már.
minden keverék 5 kvbabból áll, ennyit kell ráhúzni.
póker jellegű szintek: 2 egyforma, 2x2 egyforma, 3 egyforma, három egyforma + 2 egyforma, 4 egyforma, 5 egyforma. Nyilván egyre értékesebbek.
Ez fontos, mert a keresettségi-listára értékességük alapján kerülnek fel. Ha túl sok erős van fent, és nem sikerül annál jobbat, vagy olyat, akkor fel se kerül. (potyamunka).
Az elkészült keveréket a készítőik megjelölik.
3. Népítélet: itt kapnak a játékosok pontokat a keresettségi-listán álló keverékeikért. Minél magasabban van, annál többet. 3 jelzője van a játékosnak, azaz legfeljebb 3 keverékben lehet egyidőben részes.
Pontok után lefokozás (csökken az érdeklődés a keverékek iránt): minden keverékről le kell venni egy kvszemet - praktikusan olyat, ami legkevésbé csökkenti az értékét. Ezután újra rendezni, ha szükséges.
Új forduló. keveréktáblák felhúzása (ezek az adott kontinens fölé kerülnek, ezek határozzák meg, h az adott kontinens országaiban mit termelnek.)
Általában 7 forduló körülig tart.
A játék gyors. érdekes, félkoop: hisz csapatokba kerülnek a játékosok, egyezkedni kell. De mindenki magának kapar. a keverésnél nem árt tudni ki mit gyűjtött -nem árulhatják el, de azt igen, h mennyi kvszemük van. Ha figyelünk, látjuk kivel érdemes összebútorozni egy keverésre. A kutatást mindenki egyedileg intézi. Összességében: gyors, jól összerakott, ötletes játék. Max 8 fős, de működik 3-4 fővel is, akkor plusz dolgok kerülnek be. Sok apró modul, ami még dob a játékon. Aromakártyák, kiemelt keverék kártyák, ötletesen van összerakva, jól működik, persze szerencse a húzáskor, de tervezhető, kombinálható. bejött. 5-en játszottuk, kíváncsi vagyok milyen többen.
Update: Kipróbálva 7 emberrel is. Tetszik. Nekünk ugyan hosszú volt a játékidő -mármint percileg- de nálunk, mi nem hosszú? Úgy gondolom 7-8 fővel si tartható  90 perc-max 2 óra.
7 fővel is érdekes, a variációk hasonlóak. a játékban nincs holtidő a sok ember ellenére sem, mert a kis csapatokra bomlás miatt folyamatosan van teendő.
Update 2. 8 fősen is. Nagyon jó: 8 fővel is pörgős marad, a keverés/kutatás révén folyamatos interakció, és emiatt nincsenek hosszú holtidők, folyamatosan foglalkoztatva mindenki. 7-8 fővel kiemelkedő játék

RATING: 4
2 plays. Not so great. I like the idea of shifting teams throughout the game, fostering a collaborative spirit. Some well designed mechanisms that tie to the theme with blends going out of fashion. A good mix of elements. However, it was designed for eight players which is a bit of a drawback.

There's a suggestion of intrigue in voting to blend vs research and in divulging what's in your roaster, but these elements never materialize and I'm not sure how they would. When you're blending you're working with your team to produce the best blend so why would you ever be vague about that? And teams agree on blend vs research before the vote so how is there any surprise in that vote unless it's a two person team?

Lastly, it seems hard to get any traction on the research tracks but I recently learned you can trade points to advance if you want.

So, after another play of this I'm not wowed. It has some good ideas and the general construction is good but the details fall flat for me. If the intrigue element was better realized I might like it more but it's just not there. File this under "gateway game for causal gamers".

Some interesting ideas and beautiful looks unfortunately cannot salvage a wonky implementation. The turn order mechanism is rather out of whack (lowest score goes first and you can lose and willingly spend VPs so watch players scramble for the last position on the score track during the first turns) and especially the central brewing part is woefully vague and underdeveloped and likely only works when the game is played as a social experience.

All the "advanced game" seems to do is considerably increase the level of chaos and luck of the draw.

Coffee serves as a very accurate analogy here: Love the smell, don't like the taste.

Didn't really do much for me.  Game of drawing poker like hands using different bean colors (set collection of sorts).  The chaos of the draws seemed a bit out of place to me, and the risk reward of placement penalties to try and get the beans you want, just not worth it.  Just didn't come together for me despite having some nice wrinkles in the mechanics.

RATING: 7.5
I was surprised with how good this is, considering that kickstarter has not produced any other games even close to this game in how well polished the final product was. 

My only gripes were 1.  bean colors way too similar, especially the brown and red and 2.  rulebook had some vaguely written passages which led to a few "group rulings" at the table that had to be verified by BGG later.  

This is a very strong game.  The design is 100% eurogame.  You have one worker, who you place to get beans and score bonuses.  Turn order uses a reverse-victory-total system like power grid, which works real well.  Once you have beans you either research to get special powers or you work with other players to brew coffee.  If you brew something, it gets ranked against the other brews using a poker-reminiscent ranking system, and scores points accordingly.  Sounds decent, fun but not something you would bust out often - that would be true except for two things.  First, you cooperate with others to brew the coffee, each person on your team must contribute at least one bean.  So it has this odd semi-cooperative element to it, but since you essentially change teams every turn (alignment is within the players control) it doesn't feel like a full-on coop, instead its more like a stock market game in feel, since from turn to turn your allies and enemies change.  That adds a LOT to the game.  On top of that you have the special powers which place a lot of variety in the game and mitigate the luck inherent in a game where you draw beans out of a bag to make poker hands.  The graphic design and the bits overall look pretty good, and it plays quickly.  We played with 6 and it handled that number very well.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Made a good first impression. There's a cooperation/negotiation aspect but it doesn't bog down. There's an interesting but not overwhelming tech tree to navigate. Meanwhile the bean drawing thing is pretty inspired. Players are trying to draw beans from their bags to form "poker hands," which determines the market value of the coffee you've made. For example, three of one type is nice, but three of one and two of another (a full house) is better. Very clever, and a nice production. Seems like it is ideal for big groups, but I'm curious to see if it's any good with 3 or 4. A very pleasant surprise.

This is an interesting game which hits a different slot than any other in my collection, I think.

It's too soon to rate this, but I think it will prove to be a fun game with elements of negotiation, strategy, teamwork and also that it will prove work better with larger groups.

(1) Solo 4-player (De-caffeinated) game played; no one attempted to use Interns at all, despite the relative bean shortage- only in the last turn or two was it an issue when playing with only four.

Solo 6-player (Caffeinated) under my belt, and I certainly didn't miss the interns - hard to say how much Flavors affected the play, but the winner was the one who had/used them. This still played quickly at 6, and I begin to suspect the higher player counts are where the game really shines.

Solo 8-player (Caffeinated), and now I'm fairly certain this is simply more fun with large groups- I really liked the quick flow and the interactions of the larger number of players, and having all the beans on the board simply offers more options- that is, if you're not leading, it does.

I'm going to start this nicely blended game at a 7.5- I really like VivaJava, even though I don't have as mnay large groups to play it, and I think it will be a popular light game with most who play.

I can't make my mind up about this game.  It does a couple of things very well: accommodates a wide range of player counts and has an interesting mechanic whereby players will team up temporarily.  You can "level up" your abilities and get to handle tactile bean counters in little bags.

However, it feels rather fiddly and never really gets "exciting".  I might try this with a group of non-gamers before I make my final decision.  I really want to like this more!

A mess of a game.  Tries to straddle the line between a social/party game and a Euro-style strategy game, but ends up with the worst aspects of both.  The game is pretty much complete chaos from beginning to end, and there is so much going on with all the blending and research that it's pretty much impossible to know what moves to make relative to the other players; as a result, there was a great deal of AP from some players that really dragged the game down.  Also, for such a socially oriented game there were way too many nitpicky and vague rules.  Since it was pretty clear that early research was key (and in order to optimize turn order), everyone's score was zero or lower for about 2/3 of the game, after which there was a flurry of blending before the slates ran out.  After the game was over I felt like a bunch of stuff happened and then somebody won, but the two weren't really connected in any meaningful way.  I really wanted to like this one after hearing so much about it on the State of Games, but it was a huge letdown.  Sold.

I appreciate how this game is still strategic while supporting a large number of players. I also like the way that players must somewhat cooperate with each other without making the others look too good, just as one might have to do at a job - it's very thematic that way.

I do feel like there is a bit too much in terms of randomness and few points at which decisions are limited. Those are pretty strong negative points for a Euro game, so my feeling about it is mixed.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A strategic negotiation game that plays best at 6-8 players and in about an hour. That's a very rare feat!

Beans come in six different colors. Each turn, players go "into the field" to collect one color from spaces on the world board, which is divided into three regions. Players in a region together automatically form a partnership and negotiate whether to try to make a coffee blend by each contributing at least one bean, or to collect research points and gain special abilities instead. Each player's beans are collected in their own bag ("roaster") and you are not allowed to show what's in your bag to the other players. You assess with your partners the chances of making a great blend because beans will be drawn randomly from each of the bags until you have 5 beans. Blends are evaluated in poker-like combos and compared to other blends to score points. One blend can score for you over multiple turns if it isn't completely unseated, but at the end of each turn blends degrade and lose a bean.

This a highly interactive game. I understand how the term "negotiation" can turn people off, but this is also a very positive game. When going "to the field" you need to assess what you need while also finding the right partnership. When partnered you need to figure out your chances of making a great blend together. While many "negotiation" games have the quality of "I win, you lose," VivaJava manages to bring in negotiation without people feeling like they got totally shafted by another player.

A good game, but fiddly. You have to shift blend slates with coffee beans on it around.

I like the dynamic of cooperating to achieve good coffee. The game seems to really shine only with 7 players+, which may be hard to find.

Reading the comments and ratings here on BGG, I must have played a different game. Meaningful negotiations weren't to be found, the research part was predominant without any interesting development and the crapshoot of "brewing" by drawing beans from the bag decided the game as the end results were so close that getting more lucky on a single brew and gaining two points more was decisive. Mechanisms were klunky all around. We are all hardy Eurogamers so our optimizing and focus on research might have crashed the game. Two thirds of the game, we were battling for being last in VPs to benefit from turn order. Whenever someone brewed, all other players shot down like vultures with their investment markers making the only relevant decision in the game to piggyback on the right brew out of 4 or 5 being made in the whole game. From midgame on, almost no beans where available anymore as they were cumulated in some players' bags. 
I enjoy negotiation games and used to play Diplomacy on tournaments. I enjoy fragile games when they have something interesting to offer, e.g. Container or Chicago Express. I'm completely on a loss what this could be in VivaJava. But what do I know as many people seem to be enthusiastic about this one. I wouldn't play it again although it has a lovely graphic design and is one of the few games being at its best with 6-8 players without being a party game.

This is an excellent 5-8 player game.  Take note that the setup is different with 5-6 players compared to 7-8.  I actually prefer the 5-6 player game where the blends cancel out potential action areas on the country board which mixes up the action a bit.  Dummy players have never been a favorite aspect of a game to me so I doubt I'll ever play with 4 or less players.  There is a fair mix of clever mechanisms in play where this becomes a gamer's party game in many ways!  The forced partnerships are fascinating as each person chooses an action disc in a region and those people must partner together - you just hope the others 1-2 players both want to do the same action as you and can work together on an excellent roast if the roasting action is chosen.  The tech tree is a nice addition and there is both a basic and advanced tech tree.  Numerous variants and expansions are included that one can add to spice up the game.  Two major beefs with the game: a couple of the bean colors and player markers are difficult to distinguish (especially in poor lighting) AND the rulebook is poorly organized.

Some interesting ideas but poorly implemented. Can probably be a nominee of game of the year if being developed by a major publisher. The game arc is extremely strange: at the beginning everyone just wants to get the points reduced to negatives as 1. the player with most victory points is acting last; and 2. the last position most likely would be the -2 VP one, so there's simply no reason in being the first/ second player till the very last turns. The game is simply too long with so few actual decisions and too much luck. Just don't ask me to play this game again.
Oh yes, the colour of red and brown coffee beans are simply can't be distinguished with normal eyesight/ non colour blind adults.

A little bit of a learning curve initially, but easy enough to sort out in the first game.

Enjoyed it but don't like the components. The red/green/brown beans are too hard to distinguish for someone who is red green colour blind.  The game is otherwise really well presented, so this is a bit of a let down.  Thematically it makes sense to have beans of these colours, but would have been better to make them different shapes / sizes / patterns.

This game surprised me -- it has great components and a cool theme that fits the play well. What I really appreciated is once you get past the intimidation of all the pieces it's actually quite straight-forward and quick. I like the coffee blend mechanic, the simple tech track and the light negotiation aspect. And you know what -- it might even work well with the full complement of 8 players.

My big qualm was with the endgame wherein I was largely in first but could not get ahead as turn-order allowed the other players to hose me each time so that I could only research. In fact the last-place player won the game. With more thought one might be able to get through this. Looking forward to trying out the many variants.

I did some good research and had a great bag of beans but I couldn't get anyone else to make the right blend with me so I came in next to last. I'd try this again but I'm not sure it's a game for me. On the plus side the components are pretty great.  Need to try this again to be sure.  Hey, it's a great theme and I did have fun playing.

RATING: 3

On first inspection this game suffers from some seriously poor colour choices – dark red, dark brown, black and dark green can be very hard to distinguish from each other (much the same as the components on ) in reasonable light, must be very difficult in poor light and this game must be pretty much unplayable for the colour-blind.
The game itself plays reasonably well and has some clever ideas but just, for whatever reason, just did not do it for me. I appreciate there is an element of skill in managing your bag (roaster, from memory) and that the way you progress on the ‘civ board’ is also important, but this game just didn’t engage me.

I would try it again, but probably wouldn’t make a point of seeking it out.

VivaJava is a rare game in the sense that it offers a medium heavy game experience for a large player count, yet has a short playing time and a minimal downtime.

It's basically a worker placement game, where you place your worker to collect beans in various colors and then choose either to turn those resources into victory points (blend a good coffee) or to build your engine (research to improve various coffee skills).

The tricky part is that the beans go into a bag and that you turn them into victory points by drawing beans from your bag AND from the bags of any other players that happened to place their workers in your area. Each bean combination has a "poker value" where 5 of the same color is the best and so on. To be successful, you must not only manage your own bag but also team up with the right players from round to round.

An argument against the game is that you have little control over which beans you draw and which players you team up with. There were also some issues regarding the timing of some events, particularly when certain cards could be played and when their effects applied. Nevertheless, if you don't have time for Civilization and has grown weary of Avalon, VivaJava would be my cup of coffee in a bigger company.

Two game plays in, and I've really enjoyed both times. Looking forward to playing with 7-8 people and getting all the rules right. As others have said, there is a lot of administration to this game, and that's where I've made a few mistakes so far. But it's great for a large game night where we're trying to find a game that will accommodate a large group.

2/8/15 Update - Played a 7 player game, finally believe I got all the rules right. Was a lot of fun with a large group. Played with family that doesn't usually play games like this, really good player interaction, kept everyone involved and having fun.

Fantastic. A game that is actually good for even 6+ players with meaningful decision and interaction. The negotiation to research or blend, the mind game of how many beans to contribute to getting the final product, good planning is required and awarded while the excitement remains due to beans pulling from bags. Another good thing is players' strength can be diversified by their research track, so you have a game with your own development despite all the interaction.

Vivajava seems to make a really enjoyable game for a wide range number of players.  Unfortunately the only game I have played so far was with 4, so you substitute 'interns' to fill the gaps that you wouldn't have with more people.

The first part of a round you place your pawns on different areas of the world to get a bonus or negative attribute, and to collect a bean.  Depending on who else sis in your portion of the world you decide whether you will team up to concoct a blend of coffee, or you all decide to improve your abilities track that give you varying bonuses to different parts of the game.

After blending, the new coffee blends get put on the point track depending on their rarity and make-up of beans.  In the end everyone scores their points and play moves to the next round.

The game is really fun with lots of different decisions to make during the course of the game.  Making a blend of coffee has a push your luck feel, but with ways to mitigate that luck so that you have the best chances to grab the beans you want.  I did buy this for the 6-8 player range, but I do fear about the length of play with the non-gamers I would need to fill the game with, but am anxious to try.  

A truly interesting concept brought to fruition by someone I know, good work TC!

Second play and I have to say I still like it. There's a lot going on in this game: balancing engine-building vs scoring, scoring vs freedom of choice (the player farthest behind has 9 actions available; the leader has 2), being on a particular team vs getting a particular resource vs getting a particular benefit/penalty, trying to form the best collective poker hand from randomly drawn beans... it's a tough one to teach!
That said, both plays I felt the arc of the game was truncated; to wit, by the time you build up an engine the game is over.

update: turns out we missed a rule about being able to sacrifice PPs for RPs if your team chooses Research. This time, the game length felt just right. It's rare to find a game that balances strategy, luck, and social interaction in as pleasing a way.

Big points for the unique mechanics.  They don't really create a very fair game, but they are fun.

Much better with more players, I'd still think serious gamers probably won't be too captivated for very long, but casual gamers may find this fits the bill nicely.

The game shouldn't take as long as it does, and the colours of the pieces, while beautiful, are nearly impossible to tell apart.

It's nice to have a game designed to take 6+ players well. It does it by having a phase where players split up into teams, and then each team decides to either advance up the tech tree or create a new coffee - which is essentially randomly pulling cubes out of the players' bags to achieve the best Yahtzee-style result they can. Techs help players get better results (eg allowing a bad cube to be ignored), acquire more cubes, etc. Going first in turn order (having low points) is important because you get the cubes you want. Going later in the turn order allows you to choose who you want to team up with, preferably another player who has similar coloured cubes to you. So get cubes, team up, Yahtzee up. Score points for coffees made and techs. Repeat. I didn't like the giving up of points to acquire new techs - the game felt like it was over-stalling as people continued to go backwards to wibble turn order (which is so important). Otherwise it went along merrily enough, creating many one turn alliances along the way, and it feels like it successfully achieves the game's goal of being a social game without needing to be a party game. Just a tad long and turns are a bit same-y though.

VivaJava is an interesting game where you seed your bag with different colors of coffee beans, and then try to coordinate with another player to create poker-like sets by drawing randomly from each of the bags. The game actually plays up to nine players (!), and it might actually be half-decent at that number. The game is fairly straightforward, and the art is nice and reminiscent of the coffee house theme.

LOL...so I am not a huge fan of VivaJava. Granted I have only played it once but I have no desire to play again. Some reasons I did not enjoy the game.

1. During Blend/Research you have to break into teams. So sometimes you might really want to research and your team wants to blend...really annoying. This is not a co-op I don't want to be on your team.

2. Blend action is horrible...I might have a certain color of beans I have been working on to create a high scoring brew and its ruined because my teammate draws some random color. I pretty much always try and blend solo.

3. Drawing beans from the bag....why, were is the logic behind this. Were can you show me thematically why I draw beans randomly from the bag. I have played games with a random bag drawing mechanic but its never been the main game mechanic and I think in this case its pretty horrible.

4. Beans!!! I know this has been harped on a lot but its near impossible to tell the stupid beans apart.

5. I hate coffee!!

The box suggests a wide range of player counts. I'm not saying it lies, exactly, but it's a very different game at 3-4 players (with interns) than at higher counts. 

At lower counts, it's not horrible, but there's better things to play. At higher counts, it seems interesting, but I didn't have the infrastructure to play it that often, and someone else locally had a copy, so I sent mine off to trade.

Good production values though.

RATING: 5
June 2014: Downgraded from 7 to 5. Played another 8 player game. Finally played the "full" game with the special action cards, which add an unwelcome take-that element to the game. I still love the brewing part of the game. Everything else around it I didn't like as much, especially at 8 players. Way too fiddly for what it is. Also, the game felt very repetitive after awhile. Typically with engine building Euros, the techs add the needed variety, but the techs themselves aren't as varied.

October 2013: Eight player game with gamers. This game is better at eight than with three *with gamers*. If the game focused more on the "brewing" part (which, by the way, is a lot of fun) and less time with the fiddliness that apparently help balancing and adding an illusion of strategy to this game, then I would rate this game much higher.

September 2013: Six player partial game, last game of the evening. Everyone was tired.

I don't think this game is enjoyable at higher player counts. Like many Euro games, this game suffers from being too light for its mechanisms and fiddliness. Adding more players makes exacerbates the fiddliness.

August 2013: First play, the "decaffeinated" beginner variant, three players.

Worker placement, competitive set collection (the value of the collection you create is dependent on what your opponents have created as well as those created in previous rounds), and upgrade tracks -- typical Euro mechanics.

What makes this special is the light negotiation added to the game. 

I think this game would probably be better with more players, but that might drag the game on longer than it should.

Pros:
One of the few games that supports up to 8 players, and is best with a larger group.
Even with alot of people, the game isn't too long.
Great art/theme. Actually makes coffee exciting.
Encourages plenty of player negotiation and a bit of scheming as well.

Cons:
Some actions/upgrades/cards are clearly more beneficial than others, which can add a bit of randomness to the game or make it much easier for experienced players. No big deal.

Overall:
This is currently my go to party game, especially with 7 players. A perfect mix of negotiation and startegy, with just a dash of luck. Plays in the perfect amount of time, as well. Rating will probably go up with more plays.

Nov. 2012: Terrific design where part of the game you're on your own and part of the game you're working with some teammates.  That's unique and cool.  I'll always be willing to play it but don't see myself buying a copy because it really needs a good number of players and we can always play Allen's copy.  I do think the color differences between red & brown beans and between blue and green player small player chits is a little tough but certainly not a deal-breaker.

If you are looking for a gamer's game with negotiation, bluffing, and fiddly bits that plays 6-8 people, this is your game.  While a good achievement for that genre, I wonder how often a casual gamer might pick this up with that player count to give this a try.  As a plus, the game does play fairly quickly (approx 2 hours even with 7 players for a learning game) so might be a nice option instead of 7 Wonders for the larger player counts.  A lot of the game is actually in the bluffing and negotiation so might not work for a friendly, cooperative play style.

RATING: 7
Innovative mechanics make this game a blast to play with 8 players. Because each turn people divide into teams, there's absolutely no downtime, which makes it unique: a non-party, short to standard length game which plays best with 8.

Having said that, it's too chaotic for me. Although the luck of the bean draw when composing the brews can be controlled by a player for themselves, when joined by more or less random players with incompatible beans in their roasters and forced to blend together, coming up with a good poker combination together requires a lot of luck. Think playing a couple of hands of something a bit like a draw poker, but over an hour and a half. Player interaction is high, as everybody talks and negotiates all the time, but actual control perceived as means for affecting other players' positions or doings is low.

I will keep the game in the collection for now, because it plays so well with 8, it has high production values and is just fun to play in groups prefering lighter games, but I secretly hope for something better designed on similar principles.

Played a 3-player version of the basic game tonight and although the Interns do add some interest, they don't quite make up from the expected interaction and maneuvering that a higher player count would bring.

The game was good with 3, but we all felt it would really shine with 5-8 players.  More wheeling and dealing.

I expect to revisit the rating after playing this again with a full group.

UPDATE:  Played this again - this time 6 player.  A much better game, rating is revised to reflect that.  As I suspected the game is ramped up with more players.  Add in another player or two and it will change again.  With 6 you are guaranteed at least two in every region so always the decision to blend or research.  Balancing research against blending becomes more important.  If you had the full contingent of 8, you will have 3 players each in at least two regions and I could see that completely changing the dynamics.

First impression. 

There's been a while since the last talkative euro games were made (trading genre) and Vivajava follows in these footsteps of high interaction, but low conflict and even manages to create a whole new niche while doing so. This is a party game (6-8 players) for serious eurogamers, it features some resource management (sorta, kinda), but most importantly - it gets your typical eurogamers talking! 

There's more (meaningful) metagame here than is immediately apparent: who do you go in a team with. Can you negotiate what your team will do (this is quite groupthink dependant, so take notice). 

And a gorgeous artwork (I love this style).

A neat theme and pretty art wasn't quite enough to overcome the feeling that despite all the different options, none of the decisions seemed to be obviously strategic or meaningful.  Perhaps the game could benefit from more plays but the first impression was that it was merely okay.  The coffee beans tokens were also a bit difficult to pick up when their flat side was on the table.

While the design sense is familiar in definition, set collection, worker placement/drafting, engine building, it mixes everything up in a lovely way. You don't just collect sets you tailor the probability of your bag pull.  You don't just place a worker and draft, you have to commit to an area, suffer consequences, and often work as a team with other players.

Lots of engaging ways to approach the game and play off of fellow players.  I'm looking forward to playing this with an larger group.  I love having real games that work with 7 or 8 players.

Quite simply, one of the finer releases of this year. I really enjoy how there is a little bit of a semi-coop that is created each round with who you pair up with to make a new brew. Timing is important in figuring out when to go with something that can last for a few rounds, as is deciding which beans to collect, and the addition of a tech tree means that there is a nice blend of mechanics in this one (pun intended).

The only eurogame I have ever played and thought, "this would be better with eight players". In the first stage of each round, players play a single disc into one of three regions (1-2 per region with 3-5 and 2-3 with 6-8 players); those in the same region form an ad hoc team and must decide, as a team, to try to score VP or build up their research tracks.

It works surprisingly well at the higher player counts, the different research tracks provide genuinely different strategic paths, and there is room for interesting decisions around turn order manipulation, investment and maneuvering for the best team.

The issue is that for the forced negotiation to really work you need at least 6 players and preferably 7-8. The higher player count does increase the downtime and potentially decreases placement strategy because it is harder to keep track of which beans are owned by each player. But the main problem is that with that number I would generally prefer splitting into two smaller groups.

[Kickstarter 2012 kickstarter edition] {Coffee; worker-placement, tech-tree; optimal 7-8p} Vivajava is a special game, it's different my other games of my collection.  The twist here is that players need to form dynamic mini-teams in the game and work together for a action.  It isn't a deep strategy game; it's highly tactical - players need to monitor what other players doing and attempt their best to get a ride and get better score. I found that player order is very important - thus, it's not wise to be the first player in early turns, when a player hasn't researched well enough.  I don't think it's useful to have many coffee beans in a roaster - it's better to exploit the coffee beans from other players.

A typical game is quick, it's shorter than 60 minutes - nice for even 8 players.

The production quality is very good!

Not feeling it with 3 players; I am sure that the entire social aspect is missing here.  Need to try with 5+ to get the real feel.  As-is, the set-up and in-game fiddliness is too much for the game experience.

Yeah, this is for sure a more-is-better game, and I'll never reliably have enough around the table to get it at it's best.

Interesting blend of negotiation and planning; however, I felt as though I had little control overall. Not my cup of... tea?

Im in the camp that this game is extremely luck based. Yes you can mitigate your luck, yes theres decision making, but in the two games ive played everyones scores were very close. But not in a neck and neck way. It was more like paddling a row boat in a storm. The waves and the current are going to move you way more than you can move yourself with your paddling. But nice ideas in an 8 player euro with negotiation.

I only played it once with 4 players, so my rating may change, but is a solid 8 based on my first impression.

The components are some of the best I have seen in a game, thick cardboard, wood, cloth, burlap. A coffee-shop experience in a box. Only two minor complaints with the components.

1. The rulebook is very fingerprint prone due to its dark cover. A gloss finish and dark color don't go well together. A dark colored cover should have a matte finish, a gloss cover should have a light color. 

2. The beans are very fiddly since their shape makes them hard to pick up. While this may be a bigger issue for some, I'm not sure I would change it since the wooden beans are SO perfect for the theme. I could easily replace the beans with cubes, but it would hurt the experience for me. No biggie, but be aware.

The gameplay is Euro all the way, but with some very unique mechanics, including a semi-cooprative phase that brings players together briefly. We were high-fiving each other when we pulled a Bold blend together. Pulling beans during the blending phase is like a mini-game within the game, lots of fun and very social.

VivaJava moves along quickly, and the research track that provides different abilities adds a level of depth that is almost perfect. The game includes many variant options and I have the "Geekspansion" so I can't wait to throw those into the mix. Being able to trade points for research is also an excellent addition to the game and points are a good investment early in the game, not so much later in the game. I like mechanics like this where you need to determine the best time to "flip a switch". 

This is a medium-weight game that the Eurogamers in your group will love, and the art is a wonderful deco style. You may be able to teach to your non gamer friends too, I'm certainly going to try.

3 plays and I still feel like I'm sussing this one out.  A lot to like about it, primarily how well it accommodates 8 players and naturally creates a game of shifting teams, that's amazing alone right there.  There's just something about the bag building aspect that always kind of annoys me.

A lot of aspects of this game that I really enjoy, primarily the tepid alliances and minor research improvements.  The randomness of drawing beans out of a bag feels a bit clunky, push your luck I guess, but the game is so short that it makes things feel very luck based since you'll likely only have around 2 occasions to actually brew a coffee.  One really good blend that can't be topped will just rake in points for a few people.

When playing with the cards, the luck quotient feels even higher as some will just give you a few instant points, actually restricting you in turn order, while every time I've seen someone able to do a solo brew, they can engineer the perfect brew safe from interlopers and sky rocket ahead eliminating the need to carry others which is central to the game normally.

Still, it's growing on me, I can't think of a game that handles 8 players better.

(After one 6 player game) Very enjoyable and easy to understand negotiation game.  Collect beans/bonuses.  Brew or research to become a brewer.   Earn Prestige Points.  Interesting "decay" in value of a brew as the public gets tired of it.   Prbably plays better with 6 or 8, not sure how an odd # of players would work.

A lot of interesting stuff going on here. I dig the semi-cooperative thing, and I think it works better here than in any other coop-but-not-really game I've played.

The biggest problem I have with it is actually the turn order mechanism. Since researching lets you control your beans more, and brewing by yourself lets you be in control, it seems like having fewer points (which you'd probably get by researching early compared to brewing early) would mean you'd care less which action you have on the board and more about who you're with, and therefore you'd want to place last - but by placing first, that leaves you at the mercy of others, and makes it hard to catch up. The people who brewed early and often just ran away with the game, even though about halfway through we were all brewing almost every turn.

Then again, that may be a symptom of playing with 5 people. I think if I play again, I'd want to play with at least 6, so that brewing alone isn't an option. Publishers: this is a good reason not to pad player counts. I was planning on picking up this game, and now I'm not; if it said 6-8 on the box and the brewing alone thing is legitimately an issue, that wouldn't have happened.

Uno dei migliori semicooperativi degli ultimi tempi, anzi non è assolutamente un cooperativo ma ti spinge a delle allenanze forzate in ogni turno. Semplice nella meccanica, veloce e ricco di interazione. Sono presenti molte varianti per allungare la longevità del gioco, e sopratutto regge benissimo fino ad 8 giocatori.

Straightforward mechanics backed up by complex strategy, this one is a hit with my group. There's little to no 'fiddly' overhead so you can focus your energy on decision making. Games are close and feel well balanced, and there's great replayability due to an array of methods to win.

I got this more or less for the player count and theme, though mechanically the theme may not really stick so well! Nevertheless from what I've read, it's great with higher player counts and I am actually likely to run this with 7 or 8. It's always great bringing a game to the table that isn't themed in 18xx or space or a pure economic engine.

Love it with 7/8 players.  The game still plays fast with almost no down time.  Negotiations are just right with an ability to force action in player turn order.  Unique theme and great bits.  Overall a fun game and a must-have for gamers in the Northwest where coffee is a way of life.

This game would be a 7.5 except for that fact that it is a real game that plays well with 8 players.

So, if I have 7 or 8 players, I will definitely suggest this one!

Generally, very well produced.  However, a couple of fiddly little pieces that could have been better designed.

The perfect 8 player game... but you need 8 players.  Just a cool way to create coffee blends and players teaming up with other players throughout the game.  Highly recommended!

RATING: 7.5
I really enjoy the team roasting aspect of the game. It is a very novel game to play. I feel there are a couple of rough areas where a little more polish might have been helpful. While the color scheme is muted and very attractive, the subtle difference between red and brown beans and between blue, black, and green player blend markers causes an undue amount of frustration. The turn order being controlled by the inverse position on the scoring track irritated some players. Additionally which actions were done in turn order was not always clear.

A niche game that needs 7-8 to be most exciting yet it beats any other game I can think of that I would like to play with a large group.

RATING: 7
Rating after one play, so take that into consideration.  A very interesting game.  One of its finest aspects is that it seats up to 8, how many games can claim that?  Better with more players (6, 7 or 8), most likely.  The game flows really well and the mechanics are fairly easily absorbed after a round or two, very minimal rulebook checking (assuming you give it a really good read-through, twice).  My only complaint is that there are lots of little bits that need to be messed with, (I refuse to use the "f word") and everyone is doing everything all at once.  But perhaps for some this will be an appealing point instead of a weakness.  It just seems to me as if some things could have been streamlined a little, it does interrupt what is a very smooth flow.  Still, our very first game (learning game) clocked in at just under 2 hours for 7 players, right at the top end of recommended length, so that is a very good sign.  Overall, a very enjoyable experience and I will definitely play this one a few times again (or more).

The theme and gameplay seem very unique here so I became a kickstarter backer early on.  My first play wasn't as much fun as I hoped... mostly because I was constantly checking details in the rules instead of getting into the flow of the game and spent most of the game watching other people to impressive things.

If you like a degree of chaos with a lot of social interaction, hidden information and playing the odds I think you can have a lot of fun with VivaJava.  I prefer to have a bit more control over my chaos so I traded this one away.

I don't think the concept of combining with other people for limited gain works. Not in this, not in Compounded, not in Kill Shakespeare. Sorry.

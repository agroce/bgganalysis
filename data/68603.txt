This is a great beer and pretzels game on the Spanish Civil War.

The game play is clean and simple. The game board art is functional and attractive. The cards were designed by someone other than a graphic designer, however. They waste a great idea by using a horrible typeface and an ugly color combination. But the game itself rises above the abject failure of the guy who tried his hand at art direction.

Excelent and simple wargame. Very competitive!
Perfect combat with just a few cards.
The only minus is that the best player of each team can lead the strategy of his team. It's fine with me...

Only played once and we did not even finish the game (because of time constraints). So for seems a bit too random for my taste. A lot depends on draw of cards and the random turn order might really screw you up.

This seemed so interesting when I played a test solo game. But in my first two-player, Madrid fell quickly, then a couple of more cities, and then we felt that PF is a case of "whoever gets the best cards wins." We found the battles annoying and silly, and bagged it after about twenty minutes. Multi-player may be better, but I doubt (and won't attempt) it.

I really like the visual of the cards, but the game's component quality is not particularly good.  As a multi-player wargame - this works pretty well and that is notable too.  However, game play can be frustrating.  How you burn through cards and the seemingly wild swings in the game due to how the cards come out and are played can feel quite chaotic.  Some of this is certainly due to poor play; but when poor play does not show any clue of where the mistakes are made - it is far too easy to simply play the game as having something wrong.  I don't want to do that as I think this game has some interesting aspects.  I'm happy to have it in the collection, but I'm not sure I'd seek it out to be played.  It doesn't pull enough to say 'must play'.

This is quite different, not sure if it is a wargame or a Euro.  Played a partnership game and I guess I let my partner down because we lost.  I was not able to grasp all the intricacies of play in one game only.  I think this is a great game but so unique that it requires a few plays to wrap your head around. We played a two player game with four sets of cards.  That worked ok but the best part of this seems to be the teamwork.  The pressure around Madrid is interesting.  The towns with an odd # of roads leading in are easier to capture at first during set up if you begin at a location next to them.  This makes the set up much more critical than I realized at first and since there are so many considerations: The value of the city, the # of roads, the position relative to your supports, the cutting off of opponents supports, etc.  The turn order adds a great element of surprise and potential uncertainties that well reflects the true nature of combat. I like the quick and tense battles-quick and too the point, but with hard choices for all.  It seems a bit strange that it is win all or lose all but I guess there was no other way to do it and keep it short and straightforward.  And since the pieces are not all your power, that it is not exactly win/loose all, since the winner had to use cards which also represent troops.  That is what is so different about this game from typical wargames and card driven games where cards are more modifiers and activators, rather than raw power that can be so quickly and simply used in so many fashions. So combat, maneuver and reinforcement must take an equal hand with politics and not just be thrown out there on military campaigns.  This game is as close as I have seen to the overarching myriad of details about warfare directly applied without all the long rules and multiplicity of charts typical to so many wargames, yet with rich historical perspective instead of just abstract play.

I never saw a game with Ayamonte in the map, more value added since it's a game designed by a Californian, that's amazing! My 20.000 inhabitants little town in an international game, it's so cool! 

That's the main reason why I purchased a copy of Popular Front, also because I was surprised when I read the great wargame designer Mark Herman saying that he tried and loved Popular Front, now I understand him. It's a simple semi abstract card driven game, not much about deep wargaming, but it's really fun to play. 

Played with [b]6 players[/b] and all I can tell you is that this game is amazing! you have to try it at least once! you're going to love this game. 

The teams configuration is a great idea. I enjoy this game immensely every time I play it.

Maybe I'm missing something here, but there just doesn't

I guess there's a sort of guessing game - a fairly
complicated (in terms of the web of effects) multi-
variate game of Rochambeau where you're dealt the 
options to play, but I don't see why that is interesting
to anyone. Surprised this gets decent ratings. Maybe
someone can enlighten me as to what I don't see here.

1 play, 4p, good time! Promising! It was a learning game, while drinking at the Asiento bar in San Francisco.

This game could appeal to new gamers and also hold the attention of experienced ones.  There are up to 6 factions (3 on each of the 2 sides), and each faction has deck of cards, which are used to move units / stacks and conduct attacks.  Each of the cards features a poster of the era from its respective faction.

The combat system is clever and resolves quickly.  You have strong & weak cards, and you must use them all before you can reshuffle them and have them drawn again.  There are no dice, charts, odds, variables or modifiers, neither terrain, weather and seasons, etc. as in many traditional wargames.  Yet there is still the confrontational edge, defined fronts and tense combat of a traditional wargame. The supply lines and other logistics are abstracted, (albeit all wargames are abstract simulations to a lesser or greater extent) yet important considerations.  I believe that the simplicity of the rules allows more freedom in exploring strategy and teamwork further than the depth and complexity of rules in many wargames.  The fact that most aspects of campaigning, including political, are simplified to a single point count basis, reveals rather than muddles the essentials of modern warfare, ie. cooperation with allies, combined arms, logistics, surprise, pressure, balance, will power, support, moral, bluff and endurance. But there is only one way for you to find out for yourself- try it!

A very abstract way of looking at a very chaotic event. Amazingly it works; if you understand the history you can feel the distillation of the conflict in the actions and combat resolution.

Major +++ for the card art (outstanding) and the graphic design.

A shame about the quality of the disks and the "warpiness" of the board (will it ever lay flat?)

only improvements I would hope for...a means of player control over initiative (similar to the politics phase perhaps) and unique player powers (which I already suggested in the forum thread on expansions)

A new favorite, one that has me looking very seriously at this publishers other games.

10/3/12 Update: this is my favorite multi-player by adding the Escalation expansion addressing everything this game needed to become a classic. The combat is tense and the gameplay is very thematic with subtle rules for asymmetric semi cooperative factions.

Don't pass this game up.

Finally another hybrid between Euro/Wargame. This one almost slipped in under the radar.  I really liked Shogun and Wallenstein, some of the only others that fit the criteria.  Though this is completely different, it is a nice blend like those Queen games titles. The rules are deceptively simple, yet contain a rich diversity of possible implementations.  The victory chart alone is astonishing in it's simplicity - yet it's gnawing and overwhelming sense of impending doom relentlessly approaches like a countdown clock on a time bomb that you might postpone a little,but not escape!

Very average logical game (put markers, move markers and attack) with pasted on theme. In your turn you must attack, because it gives you points and additional cards. When attacked you must defend, otherwise your enemy gets too many cards. I hoped for an interesting hand management but there's none. Besides random player order is really annoying.

A fairly baseline CDG where the cards have values and special abilities, rather than events. Cards vary quite widely in value (1-5), but it's the variable hand size that is the crunch factor in how well you do. Capture a few cities and you're well away, run out of cards and you're screwed. This means that it's very difficult (if not quite impossible) to recover from a bad start, but at least that keeps the game within the 90 minutes, any more would be outstayed welcome.

The Spanish Civil War abstracted and yet, at the 10,000 foot level, simulated somewhat compellingly. Great fun as a light war-game.  A CDG as well, but a little more flavor could have been added to the events without impacting game play, so that was a missed opportunity. Still well worth the attention of anyone who enjoys consims.

After three games, I'm enjoying Popular Front.  It's really a game about logistics, since that determines a great deal about how and where you can reinforce and fight.  That means that games often come down to trying to cut off and surround enemy concentrations, which is both cool and somewhat reminiscent of Go.  The setup phase particularly feels like a game of Go!

Very abstract eurofied "wargame" with the hand-/deck-management being the main thing. The "extra card for a successful attack" -rule is good for discouraging turtling, but on the other hand, especially the 2-player game suffers badly from a rich get richer -syndrome if one player draws a crappy initial hand and the other grabs a city or two early, giving those extra card draws that make a big difference.

As a team game it's better for the reason mentioned above and the turn order gets more variable. And for the same reason, with 2 players play 2-3 factions per player, improves it a lot. But as a 2 player game it's just not the same as there's no uncertainty of not knowing your allies' hands.

This is a very abstract game but can be taught fairly quickly but has some depth. It is like Go in a way but is a point to point card driven war game. Pros: can add up to 6 players split into a configuration of 3 vs. 3, the cards use the propaganda posters of the times, easy to lear rules; Cons: rulebook is poorly organized, no player summary. Overall easy to get to the table.

I'm a wargamer who will play Euro-style games but I don't really love them.  This game fully satisfied my wargaming itch.  It is difficult to describe because there isn't any game quite like it.  Simply, as others have said, it has some Euro-elements, some Go elements, plus card-driven battles and a unique victory system.  It is also a good cooperative game.  These work together very simply, and the game just plays fun.  Strategy revolves around trying to build up local advantages to take over the major cities.  The cards are the heart of the game and you always have to decide whether to use a card to help win a battle, build up your army, or gain a political advantage of one sort or another.  The game really rewards careful thinking but doesn't require memorizing a lot of rules.

12/11/10 Obtained. Concerning the components - its nice the board is mounted, but mine won't lie flat no matter how much back bending I do. A few of the disks are waaaaay too thin, about 1/4 the height of the others. Many of the disks have chinks out of them. The quality of the wood gives the impression I got a bag of factory seconds. Oh, and getting that infernal sleeve off the box took super human strength. I was sure I would end up tearing the whole thing to pieces getting it open. Whew, talk about tight tolerances! However, the cards are of superior quality. Overall the components make this the cheapest looking game in my 200+ collection. I find it strange that of the two dozen people who wrote comments on this game not a one mentioned the components in the slightest, as if they didn't matter. 
11/02/13 I finally played a four-player game. So now I can speak to that aspect of Popular Front. Its unlike any other game in my collection. Its full of tough choices (e.g. should I use my last card in combat, or for politics?). Combat is often tense as its not an easy decision as to which card to lay down first out of one's reserve. This all makes for a great game. If the production values were up to snuff I'd rate this game a nine, but I have to take off two points for the defects mentioned above. Also, the 90 minutes time estimate is waaaaay off; my game today took 2.75 hours (6 rounds).
12/28/13 Played another four-player game; 8 rounds in 3.75 hours. I still like the game, but the duration dragged on everyone.   
03/25/17 Played another four-player game; 4 rounds in 2.5 hours. I still have no idea how the publishers can say this is a 90 minute game.

I really like this game. It is simple, although not quite as clear as it could be but doesn’t take long to work out any confusion in the rules. The simplicity of a Euro-style mixed with the challenge of conflict in a military/political arena is very nicely done. The 6-player version is genius in its challenge and fun in its play. Lots of trash talk went on amongst my game group. Although you can’t share or view each other’s cards you can talk in vague generalities about strategy and it all works really well. You don’t have to worry about getting bogged down in military detail or Euro mechanics and brain burning. Conflict and taking cities from your enemy is key. This isn’t a gentle, soft and cuddly Euro. The design captures a wonderful balance of Military strategy and conflict and Euro feel. The components are nicely done, it looks great. Not sure if I could ask much more. Popular Front is tense, challenging and most of all really fun. Not perfect as there were some slightly confusing bits in the rules which were sorted out but definitely one of the best games I’ve played in a long time and I highly recommend it!

RATING: 6.8
A "reasonably" quick war game that scales to 6 players which must be a good thing, right?
Well, there are some good points: the card driven battle mechanic is very good indeed. None of the randomness of dice and running down your cards in a concerted attack costs your dear. An realistic runtime of sub 2 hours is also good.
On the not so good side: the turn order randomness can lead to one side taking all the early turns in the round. I think there is an advantage from going later in the round so that you can take locations which cannot then be retaken before the round end. Also the downtime between individual trust can be quite long and at worst you could wait for 10 other turns to take place between your turns! On average this should be 5 turns which is about 10 - 15 minutes.
After one play, this game has potential and I need to play it again to find out.

Design and research was long and difficult, but enjoyable.  We tried many iterations, some with miniatures and troop types, like Axis and Alies, some with factions assisting each other or not, like Diplomacy, some like Illuminati or Coalition in terms of the manifold political interactions.  We finally settled for an abstract and simplified approach to all aspects of the conflict.  While this might not appeal to all traditional wargamers, we are hoping to gain the Euro gamers attention.  Either way, this is a quick and brutal approach to a long and brutal war.

RATING: 6
A team based, point-to-point CDG made simple to get the timeframe down. To this end it works. Each player has their own deck, from which you draw 2 at start of turn and 1 and at end of turn (plus one for each fight you win, encouraging attack). Cards are two-pronged, with numbers and powers. Actions on a turn are to get troops out and move them around (equal to the card's number, or more if the card's power is a "muster" power), add cards to the political pot (each round, whichever side wins this reduces their "reqd score to win" by 1) or attack. You can only win the game by attacking and gaining cities, where city is valued between 1 and 4. The attacks are the be all and end all of the game, being the fun, being how to win, plus taking the most time. The attacker declares which units are attacking (point to point), plays a card into their "reserve" face down, and then players alternate playing cards face down until one of them passes. Then the defender gets to reveal and play first, and there are cards in each deck which allow you to kill face-down cards, others to kill face-up cards, others which are unkillable and so on. As the attacker usually won't attack without decent cards, and the defender is limited to what's left in hand (which may be depleted from previous attacks), the attacker usually wins, but there are many surprises in store throughout the game depending on what kind of first strike the defender can deploy. Turn order is random within a round which makes for some interesting situations, be it a long downtime without much to do but to offer advice to your teammates, or sequential turns for the one side, allowing one player to whack something so the next player can get at the next city. Strategic board positioning is key as you can only muster units into cities where you have the most point-to-point links to it. Also you aim to isolate enemy cities (ie you control all cities linked to it) as all card powers (bar one) played in its defense are null and void, only the numbers count, making life easier for the kill. So there's combat fun and some straightforward positional strategy required which provides pleasant interaction with your teammates. On the downside, the game gets a bit same-y as it goes on, with fair downtime in a 6 player affair, and it lasts a bit longer than the repetitive (non-combat at least) card play supports. Because you've got identical decks, the end-result should be close and I have a suspicion it might fall to who's got the best of the cards second time through their deck. In the end, a well constructed game, but one which didn't grab me due to it's pull-me pull-you tug-of-war nature, a lack of angst (the cards fall as they do) and a lack of turn variety.

Great multi-player wargame approachable by all while also offering something heavy enough for the wargame community.

The design is so clean, simple and elegant. The most enjoyable part of the game is the narrative arc that is created by the swings in momentum that play out. From my experience no one side has run away with the lead. The key strategically is to not just play cat and mouse flip flopping area of control on the board...you need to cut supply lines and encircle your opponent(s). 


I have played the game at my last 3 game nights and in fact 4 members of my group have purchased the game based on the positive game experiences.

I enjoyed this a lot. For my money it's more of a Euro than a wargame, but it's full of difficult decisions, both regarding where to attack and how to play cards during attacks. I really got the feeling that the designer(s) had put a lot of thought into making each game process as challenging as possible, and that made for a very enjoyable game. It felt a bit short to me, but game length can be extended if players want it, so they have though of that too. Very much looking forward to getting this on the table again.

Es un juego sobre la Guerra Civil Española con un despliegue y un sistema de juego poco histórico pero muy innovador, donde podemos conseguir una victoria militar y/o política. Pueden jugar de 2 a 6 jugadores, pero divididos siempre en dos bandos. Cada jugador tiene un mazo idéntico de 20 cartas, donde el uso que le des a tus cartas es más importante que la suerte al robarlas.

Interesting game, with the exact mixture of complicity and theme in order to be both fun and challenge.

Pretty good game. I liked the card resolution but thought defensively it may be a bit too strong.
Played a third time and reduced my rating. This is just not a game for me. Still not liking the card play. I don't think I would play again.

Despite what anyone may say, this is not a wargame. It's an abstract strategy game heavy on card/hand management masked in the Spanish Civil War. In that context, it's a solid game and enjoyable. I look at it as a lite version of Espana 1936. You achieve the same objective in half the time but lose a lot of extra flavor.

Playing it with 2 players, even if you are doing 2 factions each, is a bit disappointing.  Artwork is good and blends with the theme of each faction, but that is where the theme pretty much ends.  The game itself is a pretty abstract area control game.  I was hoping for more politics in this game though.

Though maybe somewhat too abstract as a wargame, as a game it has nailbiting decisions. Also what sets it apart from other games is that it's a team game.

This is easily the best version of Clue there is! There is no roll-to-move dice, and the NPC characters are handled by way of the computer in the game. While it may seem silly to seriously play a talking electronic game with a 3D board, this one is great. The deduction is just as tricky as ever, but there is the added struggle of tracking down all of the characters for clues around the board since they are controlled by AI. 

Most importantly, the personalities and voice acting of the NPCs are just fantastic.

Also, Rusty is high as a kite.

Clue FX improves on the original game significantly. There is some randomness, but the game feels like it's moving more quickly than the original and the electronics are integrated nicely.

RATING: 4
{1 play • 3 players} The talking and the sound effects are cool, and I like the notion of having to find the inspector to try for the win (it kind of balances for the slower players), but taking information away from the players by giving each of the Clue characters their own card, well... it means you must "find" all eight characters or you can't win, unless you just want to guess, which isn't what a deduction game should be about.

Talking Clue, novel concept, Ok game. Move around the board, push your piece on a certain spot at your location, and the game tells you (and your opponents) who you see there and who might be leaving. This is a good adaptation of Clue as it removes the ridiculous die rolling of the original and it works well for only 2 players. Another good thrift store find.

I like technology added to games as much as the next guy, but this is not the greatest.  It doesn't really make sense at times how the characters move around, and the deduction takes a back seat to the loud electronic voice.  Still, the random turn order is nice, and the added choices on each turn are good.

I like normal clue (the theme more than the actual game).  While the theme of Clue FX is a bit weaker, it plays so much better.  I'm surprised this still isn't being made, as it has replaced Clue in my mind.  I particularly like that a player isn't the killer and like that you have to hunt for other clues (rather than just suggestions to players).

I loved Cluedo as a kid & I think I still prefer the old version over this one as I quite like the chance factor in the old one. But this version has a lot going for it: shorter playing time, no frustrations over dice rolls, easier to play with younger children, cool 3D board, and you can play with just two people (a huge plus). One potential limitation might be the board itself - I sometimes wonder if the wires in the board could be damaged if it's bent the wrong way?

Picked up cheaply at a Goodwill, otherwise would never have tried. I'm not a fan of deduction games, as a whole.

I'm a sucker for Clue so I was almost certain I would at least like this.  However, after playing, I may possibly LOVE it!  It's better than Classic Clue.  Yes, I said it!  I really enjoy the ability to go around finding suspects to interrogate along with how the game board works and of course the electronic voice.  The huge pro here also is that now you can play with two people!  Clue for two!  It's great, it rhymes, it's...too bad it's out of print.  :(

A little better than Cluedo. There's no more dice rolling, and the game plays the same but with a twist (because of suspects who hold some of the cards). The suspects move around the board, and players have to chase them to question them. This does get a little frustrating, but it also adds a bit more tension to the game. 

To me, the biggest flaw in the game is that turn order is random. The computer automatically selects whose turn it is. This can really have a huge effect on the game if you are chasing suspects or trying to make the final accusation. 

Board and pieces are attractive, and the computer element was really well-done but ultimately, this game is just a repackaged version of Cluedo.

My (presumably UK edition) is called 'Electronic Talking Cluedo SFX'. A lot of people do misread the title though, when they first see the box or its paper contents. Perhaps this is why the title is changed to Cluedo FX on other versions?

I've uploaded some photos of the box and paper items to the gallery since there don't appear to be any of this version. Once the mods approve the pictures, you can see for yourself.

Regards the game itself, it's much pacier than regular Cluedo. When we have friends over we all much prefer to play this than the regular game, and the narrator is hilarious: especially the 'waiting' puns.

Basic Clue mechanics, with logical storytelling. The fact that it's electronic is easy enough to get over.  At least now, the detective knows he's not a killer, and all the weapons are blunt objects and cause the same sort of wounds.  And you get to interview suspects.  And no rolling!!  What Clue was supposed to be.

Neat spinoff of the original Clue game.  The elimination of dice movement keeps things moving at a quicker pace without taking away from the core element of deduction.  The idea of searching for suspects to get additional clues actually makes it feel more organic to the mystery theme.  Not quite a fan of the random nature of turn order or the hunt of the inspector that's required to make the accusation, but otherwise, a must-have especially for any Clue fan!

FINALLY... a version of CLUE that TWO people can play!!!  This game is a top-notch production.  Great board, great pieces... everything is very nice.  I like the way the game plays compared to original clue.  The game was a bit pricey when it was available in stores, and I can see why that might have kept some people from buying it... but I'm certainly glad I picked it up!!  A one-person game would've been nice... and perhaps also allowing more than 4 players would've been good as well!!  If you are a lover of Clue, how could you not like this version???

It's good, it allows two players though a two player game only lasts about 30-45 minutes. It's nearly the same as traditional Clue, but it definitely lacks the feeling of interactivity due to the lack of dice rolling (You're allowed to move freely about the board). It's a neat novelty concept however and a good break from the usual.

Meh, it's clue. Mine's a thrift find, and somewhere along the line the "Grey" mini got replaced by a Col Mustard mini (that doesn't work with the game). Weird.
Donated back to GW.

RATING: 5.5
Sometimes a slight cut above regular Clue, especially with younger players. The audio can get annoying over the course of a game though, soooo...I guess that disqualifies me from being "a younger player" [yes, it does!]

Sold via eBay.  Fun enough, but the randomness of where the Inspector is takes away from the game.  I still prefer the regular game.

Take the roll-and-move out of Clue, and add a computer-based board that adds sound effects and some randomness.  I find it to be a much more enjoyable game than traditional clue; it's certainly faster!

Have played this with my kids often.  Not brought out much these days but clue was a game I had throughout my childhood and looked forward to playing with friends and family. My mom and I probably played 100 times together over the years.

Oddly my family's favourite version of this old chestnut. Certainly is fun on occasion and the ability to play 2 player Cluedo should not be underestimated.

This is probably my favorite version of Clue. There's a little more suspect tracking than in other versions.

RATING: 8
This one has a very high coolness factor. I find that this version depends more on skill than the previous versions. Can be frustrating if a character you are trying to track down keeps moving around the board.

I've played a lot of games looking for an improvement to Clue.  This one ain't it, either.  It's impossible to deduce what's in the dummy hand; you have to see every card, which is kind of a drag.

RATING: 6
Probably better than the original Clue, but not by much. Good deduction game for developing minds though.

GREAT! I love the layout & how the computer chips are embedded in the game board & pieces. I like the shrubs on the mansion as buttons too.

Electronic version of Clue.  It's good and you can play with just two players.  The board is cool looking with the 3D mansion background.  There is no rolling of dice, so it goes much faster than regular clue.

RATING: 5
Another version of Clue with another gimmick. The audio effects for this were somewhat interesting for a little bit as was the addition of new locations and characters but it eventually was traded away.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Evidently, this is the Clue game I've been looking for - the one that two people can play.  I like deduction games, and Clue is the 500-pound gorilla in the room, but it's almost impossible these days to find people who are willing to play. Clue FX may solve that problem for me.

My only caveat is that the mechanism will keep prompting for the next player's turn while the previous player is still getting card information from the other players.  If only there were a way to pause this, or at least let each player signal the end of their turn somehow.

Okay. Although, a young gamer really liked it. A Clue game that can be played with 2. However, the electronics in one part of the board are already failing after just a few plays.

Fun talking Cluedo.  The talking is a gimmick, under which hides the same old game, except this time you have to find the hiding detective to make the claim.  Good fun occasionally.

RATING: 7
The best Clue edition. Players are no longer suspects. No more never ending drags near end games. The electronic addition gives new experience, not just audio narration, but actually more interesting investigation and searching. Clues are now scattering among players and each suspect, which further your investigation experience. It's now more like a detective game than a pure logic game. The accusation is only made at the sheriff location, so one may attempt to work parrallel at getting clues and locating the sheriff. Great one. And I got it cheaply from eBay.

Clue with an electronic board, more characters, and more locations. I really enjoy this one as it sets itself apart from clue by quite a large amount, plus electronic games always get bonus points in my book.

Plays 2 to 4. Good adaptation of the original game. Non-players add something to the game.

The electronic aspect added into this edition definitely makes this the most unique variation of the Clue series.  The components are excellent and feature some pretty impressive artwork.

Odd game, like a cross between That's life and Loco or an even simpler Batavia, there is a game there but its too chaotic & abstract for me to enjoy it

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Interesting diversion.  Light choices.  A little Verflixxt, a little Loco.  Plays quick, but not nearly as quick as Loco.  I'd play it again, but I probably wouldn't buy it.

RATING: 7
An ultra-simple combination of race game and set collection.  Move a pawn along a randomised path to the next disk of its own colour and pick up one adjacent disk from either side. The race is to get the pawns that you will score highest to the podium first.  The catch is that to get them there you have to move them over disks of their own colour, not picking up those disks.  Black extra turn  and white multiplier disks add complications. Big Points plays quickly and manages to be fairly engrossing. 

You don't get a lot in the box (it could have been even smaller), but what there is is sturdily made.  The rules are brief and reasonably clear.

RATING: 6
This game doesn't really fit, IMO, in the wonderfully consistent Easy Play line, as there's no dice to roll, no luck, and lots of potential for analysis paralysis.  And on top of that, the analysis paralysis is actually kind of warranted, as this is one of those games in which players need to pay attention to all the other players (rather than just optimizing their own game) otherwise they might "accidentally" set someone up, potentially throwing the game... and there's not much you can do about it (well, depending on where you - and/or your group - stand on table talk).

I do appreciate the elegance here, though.  And, for some reason, I'm a sucker for this long path mechanism (Tutankhamen).

It's like a neutered Tutankhamen, and I'm not fond of that game to start.  Perfectly light and playable, but I would neither ask for it nor want to play if asked.  Seems like a fair game for kids.  Still, if I'm hopping around and taking tiles I'd much rather be playing Verflixxt.

:d10-4:

This is growing on me as a great filler-length game with real, interesting decisions. The rules are dead simple, and the Patchwork-like piece action mechanic packs a lot of punch into a simple move-and-take choice.

My worry is that the game is theoretically solvable due to the low number of turns and perfect information, but for now we're not really treating it with that much serious study.

I'm interested in trying this with 4, as I think some shared incentives would come into play a bit more.

This is a terrific and fast fun little race game. The scoring and game are improved by making the first pawn to arrive worth 0, rather than the other way around.

It's a shame that this has become the representative game from the Schmidt Easy Play line of games, because it's actually a perfect-information multiplayer abstract. The rules are simple, but the other games in the series are lighter and very luck-based, and this isn't as much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very cool, quick game.  I would give it an 8 for two players, 7 for four players.  With two, it's mostly tactical, but you can plan ahead some as you are dealing with one other person.  With four, it's mostly tactical.  We played with open chips.  I think hidden would be better.  Either way, the game is fun!  Reminds me of Loco in the scoring.

Update May '12 - up to a 9 but with two or three players only.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Okay filler if you like abstracts.  A bit on the long side, though.  Each pawn can only move to its own color.  Then the person who moved the pawn takes an adjacent colored disc.  The faster the pawn reaches the finish line, the more points discs of that color are worth.  The final turns of this game can take a while as players engage in min-maxing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar to Tutankhamen (which I also like) but a bit more streamlined. Works fine as printed, but quite like this variant too:

1. First in worth zero, 2nd, 1 etc
2. When you move a pawn home take *any* colour disk remaining

RATING: 7.5
Only played twice. Nice simple (and very quick) abstract with plenty of depth as you choose which pawn to move and then which disc to take as you try to maximise your score. The first pawns to reach the end score highest and you multiply their value by the number of discs of that colour you've managed to collect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun game in the realm of Tutanhkamun, it looks like German Candy Land but isn't. Could fall prone to Analysis Paralysis so make sure the game skips along. Move a pawn to the next matching color space on the track then take either the disk ahead or behind the pawn. Those disks score points depending on which pawn wins the race.

RATING: 6
A path of various colored chips is laid out and pawns are moved down the path allowing you to pick up chips as you move the pawns.  The earlier a pawn finishes the path, the more its correspondingly colored discs are worth at the end of the game.

Pretty cool decisions overall, and you really have to pay attention to what other players are doing.  While the rules are super simple, the decisions can actually be pretty tough at times, as you want good stuff for yourself without setting others up for a good move.

Overall, a good, somewhat thinky but quick filler.

[17 Jul 2017] - 5.5 (3 plays)
A simple game where players take turn collecting discs by moving any pawn to the next available disc of its color. The kicker is that the value of each color is determined by the order in which the pawns move through the whole track. This means players are trying to stay close in terms of number of each disc they collect while trying not to let other players have too big of a move. It's a simple filler game that has a tactical feel to it. Better at higher player counts since the 2 player game felt too easy to control the game.

A path-removal racing game where the players are working with or against each other to determine the points values for the different colors by the end.

Excellent little game, blindingly simple but reveals itself as you play. Move a piece, collect a disc, try to get more discs which will score most at the end.

Reminded me a lot of Tutankhamun but is sufficiently different.

Big Points is simplistic yet strategic.  I enjoy that the randomness of setup can change strategies for each play of the game.  The only setback I see lies in there winding up being a bit of king-making in a some situations.  There will be turns where no matter you're move, you're setting up for the next player to obtain a black or white token, which can completely change the course of the game.  Otherwise, good and simple game.

This game plays very quickly, and I have enjoyed it.  There is the strategy of when to play the black disks, which colors to push forward fast and which to ignore, and figuring out what your opponents have.  A nice game that I'd be willing to play a bunch of times.

RATING: 7
A fun little game that is very reminiscent of Knizia's "simple, yet deep" games like Loco!, Tutankhamen, Bunte Runde etc.  I guess certain players may have the tendency to lock up if they are prone to AP, as you could analyze things to death.  Because of this I would be interested in playing with hidden tokens so that your opponents could not easily figure out the relative value of a particular move.

LIKE:

* Nice production.
* Easy play right out of the box.
* I appreciate the three different types of disks in that black disks allow an extra turn and the potential to move backwards to select a high value disk, white disks which score based on the number of unique color disks that you have, and then the other 5 colors which score based on when they finished (4,3,2,1,0 points).

DISLIKE:

* One player playing poorly will likely hand the game to the next player after them.
* One can usually only put off setting someone else up for so long...and one can get stuck in that pattern with an even number of players.  I wonder if 3 and 5 would be the sweet spots.

Érdemes kipróbálni, és akár többet is játszani vele rögtön egymás után. Egy-egy játék pár perc alatt lezajlik, szóval iszonyú gyors.

One of the best fillers I know.  It's unique, colorful, tactile, and surprisingly deep.  Has similarities to Cartagena, but is more streamlined, quicker and subtle.

Key elements that set this apart:
- Generated path allows for a bit of light creativity that gets everyone involved immediately.
- Surprising variability...game can be very different dependent on the color distribution.
- Incredibly interactive as you are thinking as much about your opponents' next moves as your own.
- Collective scoring, in which everyone communally decides the points.
- Satisfying sense of progression in each game as the situation evolves.
- Fast play time which is good for one-off plays, or multiple plays in a row.
- Extremely high complexity to depth ratio.
- Non-gamer and gamer friendly.
- Colorful and tactile as you collect and hold the bright discs.

A quick-playing game, similar to [gameid=300], where you're trying to collect coloured discs along a track.  The discs score depending on how quickly it's color finished.  There's really no luck (except perhaps turn-order) and some interesting decisions that don't bog down in too much paralysis.

First impression (5 players) : It's a pretty fast abstract filler. You move a pawn on to next similar colored piece in the line and take a first free piece next to it. Once a pawns go to the end their value is determined in decreasing order of arrival and every piece is worth as many points. Ok filler.

The game "works" with 5 players but it is very chaotic but with just only 3 players it's probably a bit bland.

A close relative of Atlantis and Cartagena, Big Points is completely abstract and has horrible colours for colourblind players. Nevertheless, it is a great 3-p filler and with care it could easily be repainted and still look polished.

There are 5 different coloured pawns. A randomly ordered path is created from wooden disks painted in the five colours, plus a few that are black or white. The pawns race from one end to the other. At the far end there is a cardboard winners podium: first goes to the top, second gets next highest and so on. On your turn, you can move a pawn forward or backward to the next disk of its colour. After moving, you take one of the adjacent disks and add it to your personal stash. This shortens the path for one of the colours, usually not the one you just moved. The black disks can be traded for additional turns, white disks give bonus scores for collecting all the colours. As soon as a pawn reaches the last disk of its colour it can be moved to the podium, from which it cannot subsequently be removed. Final points are scored based on podium position multiplied by the number of disks collected, with bonuses for white.

I didn't like the chaos when we played 5-p, but 3-p was very, very good. I am tempted to buy a copy and repaint it

Not as bad as everyone says it is.  It's an average filler and one I can envision playing with the family.
I also feel that scoring should be reversed, ie first in should be zero points.  I also feel like this is missing something that changes up the rules a bit or mucks with other players.

I played this recently along with two others (Finito and Numeri).  This was by far the most interesting game of the three.  In a lot of ways, it was similar to Tutankhamen (high praise in my opinion).  While it is fairly simple, there are multiple tactical options to choose from.  And it is over quick enough that it doesn't hurt too bad if you choose incorrectly.  [01/08/2001]

Was really looking forward to playing this quick abstract, but both Wifey and I both felt a bit underwhelmed after 1st play (2 player).

May improve with increased player count, although it would give you less control of each colour pawn.

UPDATE: just played a 4 player game and seems to has come across much better. Setup almost takes as long as the game itself... rating staying the same for now. Potential to rise on more plays.

It's Tutankhamen without the wack endgame (keep tokens hidden) and more than a touch of Bunte Runde -- Knizia must be squirming.  Needs variants.  First in should be worth zero on up, and when you pull a token, you should be able to pull any from the stack that are left.

It's a fun enough filler.

RATING: 7
A simple, streamlined version of Tutenkhamen. It plays very quickly (at least, it should!) but still has some interesting decisions throughout. A nice filler.

You randomly arrange the colored discs (5 colors, plus black and white). Place all pawns near the start area. On your turn, move any pawn forward to the next available disc matching its color; then take the first available disc in front of or behind the pawn. If you'd previously collected a black disc, may discard it to move your pawn backwards _instead_ of forwards. The game ends when all pawns have made it to the end of the track (ranked 1st - 5th). Each disc is worth VP = (5 - rank). The white discs are each worth 1VP / color you've collected. The player with the most VP wins.

Reminds me quite a bit of Knizia's Quandary (or Loco) because you're collecting colors that will end with points assigned.  The black and white pieces here are a nice twist and I like the simple rules, short playing time, and interesting decisions.  Bonus point for the colorful box cover.  I played with five and I think that might be a bit much-three or four would work better.  A fine game as long as it moves along.

Pretty neat abstract. Simple and luck-free, so I fear that there might be a certain optimal play that everybody tries to pursue once they've seen it. Haven't reached that stage yet, so I continue having fun with this. I suspect that it's not very good with more than three players, but haven't played with those numbers yet.

RATING: 7
Initial rating.  Nice game with 4. This is the type of game that I would qualify as fiddly, as opposed to what most people qualify as fiddly.  What do I mean?  I mean people on BGG generally refer to any game with upkeep which must be done at the end of turns as "fiddly."  Or games that have a plethora of pieces.  So most wargames get refered to as Fiddly.

What I consider fiddly is where there is some kind of seemingly unnecessary upkeep that must be handled.  Something where I think that there must have been some way to design it out of the game.  Wargames with lots of counters and markers and constant upkeep and tracking--not fiddly to me, it's intrinsic to the game.

Now with that definition out of the way, this game is fiddly in that it requires removal of what is effectively the gameboard spaces as you play.  This leaves two options:
1. The Lazy.  just keep taking out pieces, leaving larger and larger gaps in the "track."  not a problem as long as the track was not super complicated due to small area to play in.  If your track is mostly straight with a couple turns you're probably fine.  but if you try and play in a small area where the track must bend back and forth before reaching the stairs, well, you have option 2.
2. The OCD.  After each turn carefully slide every piece which was behind that one, up a bit to keep the track nice and tight.  Needed if you have a very loopy track as well.

It makes it feel not polished.  But the gameplay is fun but feels like its development was cut short--if only it wasn't for the track-holes.  Plays very well with 2, but scales up well.

RATING: 7
Great little set collection (stock market?) filler. Most vicious with two; more players adds more chaos and also a strong left-binding problem if one player isn't paying attention. I hope to try with some of the variants mentioned here (reverse score order and/or take any podium disc) but it's fine as written. Good stuff.

[Schmidt Spiele 2008 edition] {Abstract, filler; set collection; scalable}  Schmidt Easy-Play series have several good games.  Big Points is one of them.  It can be learnt in 5 minutes including explaining the special function of black and white discs.

Big Points is a good gateway game for children to appreciate abstract game.  It is a tactical game with 2-3 players and can be mentally challenging.  It becomes a fast-paced game with 4-5 players with little control.

It is not original.  The core mechanic can be found in Bunte Runde, Tutankhamen, That's Life!, etc.  But I think it is special and fun enough to be in my collection.  A typical game runs around 10 minutes.  Replayability is good due to the random setup.  Recommended!

One strategy is prominent in 5 player game - get 2 or 3 white discs and 5 other color discs.  This will guarantee at least 20 points with 7 discs, regardless of the final color order, which is quite a lot.

The ladder is a nice gimmick.  It is handy for other games.  The pawns and discs are colorful.

Yet another nice addition to the Easy Play line of games. Much, much better than Finito! This is somewhat similar to Tutakhamen by Reiner Knizia, but much quicker to play and set up and everybody controls all the pawns. Not a whole lot of strategy but enough to make one think at least 2 or 3 moves in advance to make sure one is not setting up somebody else. I probably enjoy this a little better than Burgenland since it supports 3 and 4 players too.

UPDATE: Big Points is a 2008 Schmidt Spiele release, which I’d already played once before earlier this year, and which I resisted playing for a second time at BGG.CON, but was coerced into giving it another shot. There’s really nothing that offensive about Big Points, but once was enough and twice was excessive. It’s somewhat reminiscent of Reiner Knizia’s Tutankhamen from 1993. Players simply move any of 5 different colored pawns along a random path of disks in order to collect those disks. The order in which the pawns reach the end of the path determines the value of the different colored disks that players have collected over the course of the 20-minute game. It’s light and random, especially with a large group of players, but maybe a good introduction to the concept of a stock market or investment game. It doesn’t take long so I was willing to play it again with a friend who had never played it, but I sure hope people stop making me play this game. ----- I've only played this with 4 players, and I think I'd like this a lot more with fewer players, especially with 2 players.  It's too chaotic with a group of players (just like Through the Desert or Hey That's My Fish).  It seems promising, like it could be a neat little game with simple rules yet difficult decisions (along the lines of Hey That's My Fish), but I definitely don't recommend it for a group of players, unless you just want a very light filler that is more complicated than a traditional card game filler (Coloretto, No Thanks), but without any more control to compensate for the added complexity.

Nice family filler. Easy to explain, but very tactical. Plays in only 15 minutes per round! Only played with the endscoring rule suggested by other BGG-ers: The first color in starts at the lowest step of the stairs. Should indeed be more exciting that way. I like wooden bits, so no complaints about the components (although they tend to get a little sticky if you play with people with sweaty hands :-)).

The Schimdt Spiele's Easy Play series should have a place in most gamers' shelves. This game ranks in between other similar games in the series. It is fun, short, but feels quite a lot more chaotic compared to Los Banditos and Finito. The games in the EP series has always been heavy on luck, this game is no exception. I assume with two players, you get more control on the movement of the pawns and the colors of the chips you collect. Hence, less chaotic and able to strategically plan ahead. We enjoyed the fact that if you want to collect chips of a specific color, you have to usually move a pawn of a different color to collect that chip, however this causes the pawn you move to surge ahead in rankings. A conundrum: do you want your pawn to move ahead and end the race, thus getting a high value, or would you like to collect chips of that color, but sacrifice your pawn in the race to the finish line. Good filler.

A neat little game. Setup can be a little arduous if you're OCD like me and want an even distribution of colors. Visually very pleasing.

Update: After playing the vastly inferior Atlantis (Colovini, how could you!?), this is very quickly becoming a favorite. There are so many neat decisions in such simple game play, and it plays equally well with non-gamers as well! Very, very much worth the re-buy.

Исключительно позитивная для меня простенькая игрушка. Быстро раскладывается, довольно быстро играется, с легкой душой проигрывается, прекрасная реиграбельность, и, если вытащить из коробки, компактна и мобильна (помещается в чехол от мыльницы, напр.)

Единственный минус - возможный кингмейкинг выше среднего, если кто-то тупит, ошибочно полагая, что небольшой личный прогресс перевешивает чей-то прорыв.

При игре же вдвоем превращается в элегантнейший безрандомный (по игре, но не по первоначальной расстановке) вариант.

Although I like to refer to this as That's Life without the die but the two aren't really similar at all.  It has a little future speculation to it because you are trying to collect chips corresponding to the color that you think might finish with the highest score.  Not as mindless as most fillers and plays just as quick.  I have to admit the setting up is quite a pain each time.  No strong feelings either way, a fairly so-so experience.

Yomi: Round 2 is a standalone item that contains four characters (out of twenty) for the second edition of Yomi. With these characters, you can compete in 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, and solo modes, with each player in the game needing one character deck. The character decks in Yomi: Round 2 can also be played against those in Yomi: Round 1 or any of the individual character decks that comprise the second edition of Yomi.

An exceptional two player game. Feels like an actual board game version of a fighting game. Well designed, and the matchups are incredible. Super fun game. Highly recommended if you like fighting games.

Yomi, Yomi, Yomi, I've got love in my tummy. :)

Great, but as I have Round 1, I'm not bothered about getting Round 2. Tempted seeing a box of 4 decks for Â£10, which is great value, but I'm happy with the first edition.

:thumbsup: All characters play very differently. They are thematic and interesting.
:thumbsup: The base mechanic of rock-paper-scissors is very thematic for a fighting game and creates an exciting gameplay. The special abilities and hand management on top take this mechanic and elevate it to a very high skill ceiling.
:thumbsup: Beside the deep strategy, there is also a strong element of reading your opponent and his tendencies, due to the rock-paper-scissors mechanic. This occurs on many levels, like in poker. Not only you're thinking about what you want to play (level 0) and what your opponent wants to play (level 1), but also what he thinks you want to play (level 2), and sometimes what he thinks you think he wants to play (level 3), etc.

:?block: The characters were balanced specifically for tournament play, but not to the point where every character has equal chance against every other character, which is probably impossible in asymmetrical play. Still, every character has a fighting chance regardless of the match-up, and it's just the matter of how many mistakes you can afford to make.

:thumbsdown: The game requires a significant commitment of time and effort to learn characters and match-ups. This is not something you can play competitively with a new player. The level of complexity is similar to a CCG/LCG, except instead of building your own decks you have 20 decks and 190 match-ups to master.
:thumbsdown: It is very expensive if you want to get a full roster of 20 characters.
:thumbsdown: I played Yomi quite a bit online on FantasyStrike, and it provides a fantastic gameplay experience. But when I tried my physical copy, it felt much slower and fiddlier. It really helps when a computer calculates and applies the damage from your combos. On top, my board came arched, and every time we tried to adjust health markers the board would start spinning around.

Great game.  Really enjoyed the tough decisions in the game.  Probably not best with 2 (which we played) but still good.  Would like to try with more players - or dig out Union Pacific and try that!

Well done re-implementation of Union Pacific and really enjoyable to play and teach.  Quickly becoming my go to game to introduce new players to eurogames/new games in general.  Very fun to play, simple rules and an attractive game once you have it all set up.  Airlines Europe, Smallworld and Survive have replaced Catan as my introductory games.  That being said, I still can't get enough of this game and thoroughly enjoy every play of it.

An exceptional network-building share-management game where shares earn you points rather than money, as in other similar games. Great components and simple gameplay, with strategic depth, make this a fantastic game. It just gets better with every play and has gone over well with everyone I've introduced it to.

LIKE: Lots of decisions. Love the unexpected payout cards. Plays in a good time frame.
DISLIKE: A little bit fiddly, but minor. Paper money is a minus. Pulling out cards during setup is a small minor inconvenience.

OVERALL: Like Union Pacific, this is a great game. Lots of jockeying for position and surprise endings. Easy enough to teach and comprehend, but enough depth for all levels of gamers.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely a really good game and I'm anxious to play it more now. It isn't quite as light as Ticket to Ride - but for me, that's fine. I was looking for another game nearly the same complexity - and the turn action and what you do in the game is really easy. It's the strategy that is much more difficult in the game. Lots of watching other players. But it is true that a turn of the cards can ruin your day with little chance of recovery.

You can see similarities to Ticket To Ride, Acquire and Samarkand in this - I've never played Union Pacific, so wouldn't know about that.  It's a slot above an entry level game.  I wouldn't suggest it for newbies beacuse there is a fair bit to get your head around, and since you don't play a colour as such, that would mess with some people's intuitive expectations.  It's an enjoyable and colourful game - a fair bit of interaction without it being very cut-throat.  One down side is that near the end, if payers don't work out possible goes in advance, it can get a  bit AP bogged down as players try to maximise spending their money on expensive routes.  My advice would be to discuss that first and nip it in the bud.

Still on the fence. I've been enjoying the plays I've had so far, but a few things are starting to feel unsatisfying: the uncertain timing of the scoring rounds, the randomness of the stock availability in the draw pool, which combine to create an inability to plan long-term (something I've internalized as important in an economic rail game).
 
UPDATE: This may not be the rail game I'm looking for, although the 6p playability is clutch.

A fantastic game. Airlines Europe is Alan Moon's finest iteration of this game to date. It is an effective blend of a stock game and a route building game in one beautifully packaged experience. I love the purple box and artistic look of Airlines right down to the little plastic airplanes! This game has removed the need for me to play either Ticket to ride or Acquire as it represents a better version of both games in one experience. I can always get this to the table with my elite gaming friends or my casual ones. This will be a part of my collection for a long long time.

RATING: 8
The good news: the introduction of victory points, combined with shares and money, creates a very interesting three-way relationship...at the fourth time of trying. 

The bad news: Game length may be slightly short of optimum. And burn Airlines, Union Pacific, Clippers.

RATING: 5.5
Scoring encourages diversity, winning requires holding majorities, the two are at cross purposes and create a problem as its better for a player to score more points by diversifying than challenging someone for a majority, whoever gets the most majorities for the least cards wins. "Well why don't you stop him winning", "Well, I make more money by playing these other shares, I didn't draw the right cards anyway so I couldn't do anything about it".

Wow!  My gaming group (3 players) has been playing this game exclusively for the past month with 52 plays to date. This is a light game (2.4), so it contains a fair amount of luck.  But the decisions can be tense as you try to balance your risks.  I believe this game will become very popular as a family or light strategy game.

Although I haven't won a game yet- we play 3 mainly and my wife has won every single game- I will never say no to a game,  even after just playing. Ok well I might say no at 3 am.

It takes the action choice simplicity of Ticket to Ride (I'm not au fait with the previous incarnations) and adds two buckets of tension .

1st play: A re theme of Union Pacific with some slight changes. I liked it better than UP but it's still not a top 10. I think acquire does it better, but only barely. I think the scoring rounds bog the game down more than they need to, but it's only 3 times in a game so not the worst thing in the world.

2nd play: The second play was quite a bit better than the first. The promo expansion that adds 2 extra bonus routes helped a lot, as did being more familiar with how the scoring works. It still bothers me that not everyone has the same number of turns, but there's a small offset in starting points.

A light family game where managing the cards you have in hand versus what's on the table is most important. The key here is to learn to balance keeping cards back and getting them out before a scoring round occurs while letting your opponents build the airlines without knowing your the majority stock holder. Lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.75
This is NOT a route-building game: it is a stock market game, and one of the best ones out there. More interesting than Acquire. Enough randomness in the game to keep it from going dry. A lot going on in Airlines Europe, and yet very simple rules: one step up from a gateway game.

I don't at all get the comparisons with Ticket to Ride and Alhambra (it's much better and deeper than both of these), but there ya go. My only major complaint about the game is that the planes for the red and orange airlines look waaaay too similar.

RATING: 9
Since i've only played the game twice, it's been superb! I love TtR, so 4 of the same actions doesn't bother me. 2-player and 4-player games were quite different and i thought i'd won both times, but had lost by a couple points, which drove me insane. That's why i want to go back so much, subtle, but easy to play, it rewards short term strategies,which is a strength of the game.

The decisions are interesting and the scoring track acting as stock price gauge is cool. I especially like how approachable the stock holding concept is by awarding points to 'majority shareholders' in semi-random scoring rounds.

Nevertheless, I feel like there aren't quite enough ways to mitigate the luck of bad cards ending up in your hand. Being able to draw cards is rare enough as it is, and I really want a little more control of my strategy to enjoy this game a lot more.

Still, it blows Ticket to Ride out of the water for sure. Seems like the kind of gateway game TtR should be. I think it's hitting a very useful niche.

RATING: 6
Pros
- Good gateway game
- Colorful planes and board

Cons
- It can get a bit math-y
- The four actions you can do are a little unintuitive. One gets you cards, but you have to buy planes first? 
- The board doesn't really need to be there
- Completing routes takes little effort for the boost
- Orange and Red look similar since they're muted

Sold/Traded because:
- I have better gateway games
- Unintuitive to teach new players. A lot of questions were asked and it shouldn't be that hard

It worked well enough, I suppose, but I think I might prefer other games of this sort. The stock mechanism is odd in that you receive money for playing your stock. I understand that you need a mechanism to add money to the game, but it doesn't feel intuitive to me, and is sort of clunky. I guess it doesn't play out in a clunky way (people just sort of "get it"), but I like my stock games forcing you to purchase your stock.

There is some luck in the cards, but it's a manageable TtR type of luck. It does seem to hit lulls at points, just like, I suppose, in TtR where you'll alternate phases of building track and collecting trains. It's just that here it feels like it drags a little more, maybe because it's a pretty long cycle to get stock, play stock and get money, and build a connection, especially given that random scoring can pop up at any point in this cycle (and cause a big difference in scoring, depending on if it shows up one turn early or one turn late).

I do also understand the point about the connection bonuses being a bit powerful, given how they're sort of easy to complete.

I like it enough, but I don't think it's quite what I was hoping for.

Its a nice stock market family game. Quite easy to teach and play. The map and the cute little airplanes give a casual feel to the game. The is some randomness throw-in so you cant really calculate much. There is enough interaction because all players affect the stock payout. I would like a bit more competition on the board. You cant really block an airline.

RATING: 7
A pleasant, well-designed stock ownership type game.  Plays like a pleasant gateway game, that is fun, and at times, on the border of compelling.  The four action choices seem nicely designed, and the face up "available cards" mechanic seems to work okay.

On the minus side, in our five player game, getting the favorable stock card turned up right before your turn felt a bit on the "is this a game decided by luck?" side.  Could it be that between equally accomplished players the game comes down to which cards are turned up right before your turn?  Hmmmm...suboptimal for me.  

Curiously, on first play, I was actually spatially underwhelmed by what really is a very nice board.  Was there a compelling puzzle on the board to be solved beyond simply connecting the rare routes to their desired cities, or is this a wide open board with some nice cities and lines with lots of numbers to choose from?  It felt like the latter.  The board was thus not compelling in terms of interest.

Still, this is a well designed game with a lot of gateway potential, and wide appeal in it.  It might be the best mellow stock ownership game out there.  I would prefer playing it to Acquire.

Can I really rate it THIS low?  I dunno, man.  Our UP-experienced 4P game was a massive disappointment for the entire table.  Production is cute, wish it were still train-based.  Colors were rough for me in bright lighting, and I would expect them to be impossible for color-blind types.  Kept calling the equivalent of UP stock "UP" :-)  Anyway, I'm really not a fan of the way the track cards work in UP.  But, I dislike much more intensely what feels like a bolted-on money mechanic with even fewer options to mitigate the luck of the draw: you need to spend money to play planes, playing planes is the only way to draw cards, and playing cards (or blowing a turn) is the only way to get money.  Maddening.  Uninteresting.  Disappointed.

RATING: 7
Union Pacific where many get rewarded for owning stock rather than the top 2-3.  Makes it much more worth owning a variety of stock and getting a lot of them down on the table before the first scoring round.  

My gut tells me that I like UP more, but this game is more accessible and forgiving.

RATING: 7.95
This is a great next step from Ticket to Ride for new players. It incorporates a stock element, which makes for more strategic gameplay, to the route building of TTR. The balance of not revealing too much too soon and making sure to get points makes the game pretty interesting. This isn't the most strategic game I've ever played, but it does involve some strategy and planning. It is one of the most fun games I play, and it is great to move new gamers from gateway games to something more advanced.

Probably the most refined game I've played. By refined, I mean how it feels like every part of the game was calculated to work together to produce a singular goal - make the best mid-weight family game possible. Thus, it has enough complexity to interest gamers but still simple enough to play with non-gamers. There is luck, but it's possible to plan around it. Players can interfere with each others, but again possible to try and prepare for it. It uses its theme productively, using it allow players to understand it complexity and knows when to simplify and ignore it.

I didn't really know what to expect when I tried Airlines Europe: I bought it when I found it dead cheap, without any info or research. But it was designed by Alan Moon, so I bought it blind.
It turned out as a great "almost-gateway" shares game. It has a simple core of rules, it's fast and every decision matters.
The production is very nice, and this game has one of the best inserts ever!
Thumbs up to mr. Moon for another family hit!

It is impossible not to compare this game with Union Pacific. Union Pacific, a game I always love and think I will in the future. Airlines Europe will not change that. Of course, AE is a good game and if UP hadn't existed even better. While playing the game I had to search some time to figure out why UP is better. My conclusion came after the second counting : because building lines cost money, so everybody builds one or two turns and then lay out some shares to collect money. In UP, if the shares are interesting enough, you take the risk to build another track, here you can't because you have no money. This nuance makes the traingame better.
I can't give Airlines Europe a bad score, but I will always give UP an advantage.

Very accessible stockish game thats a bit like ticket to ride at the same time.  There is a lot of randomness here in terms of when shares come out and when the scoring cards turn up - I dont mind this as it ties in with the light rules etc and its really tense whether the scoring card comes out before you or someone else get to lay down key cards.  I dont exactly love it but I love how wide and broad the appeal for this will be from ticket to ride fans to stock game fans and everything in between.

It's the next logical step up from Ticket to Ride. Love the two-player variant in this one, where all discarded cards go to the neutral player for the third and final scoring, which adds some great decision-making in the end stretch of the game.

A very pleasant gateway-esque stock game that has a strong Ticket to Ride feel while still being totally different. My only major complaint is the game somewhat overstays it's welcome. Maybe with experienced players the game plays briskly but in my one experience with new players the game felt like it should have ended 20 minutes sooner.

Ticket To Ride is a great game, but i think Airlines Europe is Moon's best. It shares the 5 card up element, but differs in that nobody owns a "line" but shares in a company hoping to expand their service and profit from it. This is great fun with more strategy than TTR but that strategy means a bit longer play time.

I wasn't so sure about this after my solo run through, but I really enjoyed playing this 2-player today.  The game would probably have it's sweet spot at 3 or 4 players, but it's tight and plays faster than Union Pacific.  I like UP better, but this is great if you have a limited amount of time.  

This game is best described as a cross between Jet Set and Union Pacific, but works as a hybrid of both.  I'd play this anytime.  

Note to the color-challenged: You may have trouble discerning colors in this game.  Also, if you are not color-challenged, you may still have issues in poor lighting.

Good, simple game that is something like a combo between Chicago Express and Ticket to Ride.  It's much simpler than CE and more complex than TtR, but essentially about buying shares in airlines and then connecting these airlines to cities around the globe.  My one play finished extremely close and while I enjoyed the play, it did not leave me super excited to try it again.

Played once.  I like it, like I like Union Pacific.

Things I like in AE over UP:
- The Union Pacific / Air Abacus drawing mechanism is fixed.
- Removed the train card mechanism to limit choices.  I prefer card play over money handling but the train cards were confusing and easy to simply forget the artificial limitation.  One never forgets to pay money.
- The little plane models are fantastic.

Thins I like in UP over AE:
- Support for six players!
- Money as VP that is never spent.  It keeps the game as simple card play which I find more enjoyable.  (Except for the train cards).

I think objectively AE is the better game, but it doesn't replace UP.  I have Union Pacific and don't intend to replace it with Airlines Europe.

So far I like this game as much as it's predecessor (Union Pacific).  The new incentive for laying stocks (money to buy routes) is a good mechanic, and I like the fact that it's harder to obtain Air Abacus stock... in our games so far most players have waited to get involved in AA until late in the game because there were so many other valuable things to be doing instead.  The extended payouts (to players in 3rd, 4th and sometimes 5th place in a stock) are also a nice change... as is the ability to trade in your face-up stocks for AA stock since you often end up with a few duds by the end of the game.

I definitely enjoyed this game, but I don't seem myself 'wanting' to play it again. If someone has it and nothing else interesting is being played, I'd give it a shot. That said, the people I played with made it really wonderful. All in all, this falls under that awkward middle zone for me: not easy enough for entry-level but not nearly complex enough for my eurogame tastes. I feel like this is a mix between Alhambra, Coloretto, and/or Ticket To Ride, all of which I'd probably rather play.

Variable action set collection. Ticket to Ride with a sort of stock market overlay. Plays quickly and with a few more tactical decisions than is required in TTR, and the remake brings in the sort of bits folks like in games these days. I'd play it again as a filler...

10x10 2015. Took a couple plays to really click.  But it's a really nice stock market game.  Making the bonus routes seems pretty important and happened in almost all the games.  The board itself felt kind of secondary- we very rarely got into a situation where an airline was blocked, although it may happen more often with the full five players.  So it really just serves as part of the main action which is the stocks.  All the games had really tight scores and the mechanics of the different actions- buying routes to get cards and increase values, playing cards for money, trading cards for Air Abacus mesh together nicely so that turns have a nice flow to them.  There is a trade off between getting cards down early to score points in the first couple scorings and holding them to bluff, which I was more inclined to do.  But in my plays, with the very close finishing scores, the first scoring was crucial.  A little dry perhaps, but a very solid game.

RATING: 6
One 2-player game. While it would definitely be better with more (and I suspect either 4 or 5 is the sweet spot), it played ok with 2. I forgot to explain the end game "third hand" scoring and forgot about it myself til the end of the game and it definitely ended up kingmaking me. It's a medium-light set collection game with a board. With more players, there's definitely an opportunity for screwage both on the board and with shares. With 2, that was a lot harder. The goal and the actions are simple to explain. I suspect it'd be a good casual game to play with friends. Hope to get to play it again.

I really love acquire and this shares a lot of things in common. I love how no one really owns any of the companies and you really have to work together to get a company to grow! I also liked having to manage when and what stocks to port into your portfolio, do you wait one more turn and risk a scoring card being played or do you play your stocks and risk never having help growing that airline again? Great game!

Very playable, easy to understand stock game for newcomers. It also satisfies the veteran player with tight action decisions between taking stock, money, or buying route licenses.

After first play I feel that the game tries to achieve to much - there's stock management, route building and money management in a game which tries to be family friendly. Game is slow to develop and game seems to last at least 75 minutes (with 4-5 players) and I feel that it keeps the interest for 60 minutes or so.

This is my kind of game, lots of choices yet very simple to learn and get into without worrying about the more experienced player having a strong advantage, I love the cute little planes and watching them spread all over the board, I love that there's that anxiety over what choices to make every turn yet it's not so overwhelming that AP becomes a major issue, I love the midgame scoring so it gets everyone involved in everything the whole game.  I really loathe the victory point tokens, I'm not sure it's worth all the fiddliness of doling those out to keep the totals secret.

[b]Airlines Europe[/b] is an economic game loosely based on opening various air routes around Europe. Each player doesn't actually represent any one company, instead they can help develop airlines so that their shares in that company will increase in value. Share value earns points, and the player with the most points after three rounds of scoring is the winner. 

AE is actually a simple game. In each round of play, there are only four different actions from which to choose.  Each choice is simple, but all lead to complex interactions with the other players.  After a dozen plays of AE, I still haven't found a single strong strategy for a winning game.

I really enjoy the simplicity of AE.  Yet it still offers complex interactions, and surprising and interesting game play. Good for non-gamers too. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ease of play and lots of player interaction make this a great gateway game. I love how everything you do to help yourself may help everyone else depending on what shares they have. Plus, it's so fun to try to snatch up shares you don't need so that another player doesn't get them. The frantic scramble for Air Abacus is often hilarious. 

Strategy is light but engaging. Achieving dominance in one stock is a good thing, but so is spreading yourself out so you have a little bit of everything. Lots of decisions to make here and just enough luck to keep things light and fun.

As a fan of the original Airlines and Union Pacific I was looking forward to this.  While it didn't dissapoint, I didn't enjoy it as much as the earlier games - to a large extent I think that's a tribute to Alan Moon's influence on game design as some of the features that were new at the time of the original Airlines. such as the [i]Wertung[/i] scoring, are now commonplace.  This streamlined approach is probably a more efficient design than the earlier games, and very nicely produced, but I think I still prefer the originals.

Even people who would never play a major stock or economic game love this. It is very accessible and fun. Ticket to Ride (while definitely a totally different game) is a good lead-in to this one.

For those that have played Union Pacific, I think you'll find a streamlined and improved version of the game here.  At least for me, it will replace UP in my collection, as I think it's a step up from its predecessor.

For those unfamiliar with UP, I think you'll find this is a pleasant stock-holding game, where players are jockeying for stock control of various airline companies to score victory points.  The number of points scored for each airline is dependent on how many routes they have claimed on the board, which is also determined by the players.

So, you might hang back with a mitt full of cards, allowing someone to build an airline for you, wrestling share majority from them after they've done the dirty work.  Or, you might find yourself in the majority position, and build the company yourself to increase your points!  In the end, the game is highly about timing of when you grab shares, and when you play them to the table, tipping your hand to your opponents.

Stockholding game while building airplane networks. I really like the decisionmaking in this game: Do I invest in the companies i already have shares in or do I jump in other airlines other people have invested in (and what are the others doing?)

Nice introductory stock/connection game. The random factor of when scoring happens adds a nice dose of drama without feeling like it [i]all[/i] comes down to luck. Deciding between paying for an expensive route or a cheap one is a nice little social choice point. This game is ripe for fun tabletalk. 

Holy crap does this game need a graphic design update though. Not only are the orange and red planes nearly identical, but the colors on the stock cards can be confusing as well. The board is pretty ugly too but the adorable planes make up for that a bit.

Over 20 years later, Alan Moon re-implements one of his early designs, Airlines, and comes up with this excellent stock market game.  Incorporating network building, set collection, and commodity speculation, it plays like a smooth cocktail of Ticket to Ride and Acquire, with a dash of Alhambra-type scoring and garnished with top-notch components, especially the colourful airplane pieces.  I especially like how useless shares can be traded in for Air ABACUS shares, which provide an additional scoring opportunity if one cannot be among the top shareholders of a given airline company.  Definitely a winner!

AE is an okay game which is a level above Ticket to Ride, so it’s not really a gateway game which I thought it would be. The problem is that I think there are too many games which fill this niche. Of course, this doesn’t automatically make AE a bad game, but it simply doesn’t keep my interest… And if I play with other ”gamers”, we play something heavier, and if I play it with non-gamers I would much rather play Ticket to Ride or fillers or something like that (although AE could be used – it’s not that complex). I’ve only played it twice, both with 4, but the board seemed way too open, so it’s probably better with 5. 

The eventual winner in both games went with a strategy of doing a little bit of everything, which meant the two winners got quite a lot of points from various companies; only a first place in one or maybe two companies, but then a lot of secondary placements. It’s also easy to be too attached to the Air Abacus company; it’s a nice source of points, but just be aware that it comes at the cost of investing in other companies, and it takes more turns to invest in Air Abacus. The route building didn’t work the way I had hoped, and the game emphasizes stocks too much, so, unfortunately, I don’t think it’s a good game.

Very fun game that puts a nice theme on stock building. Similar to Acquire in some respects, although the randomness of the cards makes it a little difficult to plan (and thus strategize) effectively.

Only played with 2p so far, and I believe this game will play better with more. Might revise my score upwards when I get a chance to play it with more people.

edit:

Having played this with more players, I finally figured out why I prefer Acquire more. In Acquire, you can always strategize in what companies to invest in, and the randomness is how those companies may grow (although this controlled of course).

In Airplanes Europe, the randomness is in what stocks you can "buy", and the predictable strategy is in what airlines you grow.

Since growing airlines may not necessarily help you, it is harder to strategize, and luck plays a much larger role in AE then in Acquire.

A fun introductory game that really only sees its true potential with the full 5 players. Playing with less is very possible but not as fun. A very good game to get people thinking of stock ownership vs. having each player be a dedicated color or company. For this reason alone I think it is a great game for my group as it introduces a different concept than what people are used to. Lots of fun and the mini expansion is a must have in my mind. Great game for the introduction of the concept of stocks.

A solid family-weight game with a bit of a stock element. It's one step more complex than Ticket to Ride.

I might be inclined to rate this a bit higher, but I already own Paris Connection and Samarkand, and I like both of those a little better. My one slight knock on Airlines Europe is that you're a bit handcuffed by the display of cards available to you. The result is I felt like I had less of a playground for "investing" in different colors. Also, unlike some other stock games, I didn't get the same sense that there were opportunities to really partner up with other players.

Still, it looks great, it's easy to teach, and I can see how this would strike the right chord with a number of groups.

Great game that is different enough from Ticket to Ride I think to keep it in my collection. The idea that no route is owned by one person is definitely different, but the stock holding mechanic I thought worked well.

We even enjoyed it as a 2-player game although the final round scoring is a little odd to keep track of, it isn't too bad and works well to have an even more competitive final round. With 2 we played that ties were a wash and no points were awarded, but you certainly can't do that with more players.

I definitely recommend this one and would like to try it out with more players, but definitely good enough for 2.

Airlines Europe is a very well designed game that scales well for two players. It's really hard to tell who is leading the game due to not knowing which stocks will come available next. This game will probably go and into a regular rotation of our favorites.

RATING: 9
Faster, quicker and easier than Union Pacific though lossing nothing of the game play. The medium weight will make this something more than a filler, but not so large as to take up the whole evening. A good addition to any collection which will scratch the itch for a stocks game where you need not control the destiny of the company.

I don't have experience with Union Pacific to compare this to, but it was a very pleasant play. Oddly, it reminded me in feel to Winsome's New York Central, a majorites card game that has a very non-intuitive presence-for-points trade-off. The majorities, however, are much more forgiving than in that game. As with many majorities games, the key is in staying just a bit ahead in the areas in which you compete.

I became interested in Union Pacific after hearing a podcast about train games.  Seems like just the thing I'd like -- between TTR (which I enjoy) and Age of Steam / 18xx (which are too heavy for me).  But, it's OOP.

However, Airlines: Europe has just come out, and has been described as being very similar to Union Pacific.  Which is why Airlines has jumped onto my wish list.  Looks like a nice step up from TTR, but still very accessible.

[b][u]Update[/u][/b]: Rating after 1 play is 7.5, with probability of going up.  Very good game with lots going on.  Want to play this again soon.

Whippet-light stockholding game. I thought of this as a nice intermediate step for fans of Ticket To Ride to step up to more complex stock games, but the general consensus in my regular group is that Samarkand: Routes to Riches is quicker, more strategically interesting, and a better introduction to the Chicago Expresses, Imperials and Acquires of the world. Still, this is a pleasant, accessible game that handles 2-6 players, doesn't take too long, and looks lovely.

A streamlined version of Union Pacific.  Not sure if it will completely replace the original for me but it is nice for a faster game.

Not sure that I like the unnecessary set-up time by removing money from the bank and removing lines based on number of players.  We followed the company removal for 2-players but both felt the game was way too short.

With a few more plays, removing Yellow from a 4-player game seems just right.

Airlines is what I consider my first step beyond ticket to ride. I watched a review Mr Vasel did and knew I needed it in our collection. I played it and the whole family absolutely fell in love.

Alan Moon is a designer who rarely hits my sweet spot for the medium-ish type games that he prefers to design, but Airlines Europe is a nice effort. Basically take Union Pacific, strip out the usually extraneous deck of track cards, and reduce the number of scoring rounds by 1 and you have AE.

AE does have an additional wrinkle in that everything on the board is governed by money, which takes the place of track cards. Money is earned by laying stock, or can just be taken from the bank for an action. The amount you spend is governed by the pips on the board where the plane markers are placed, and the company's value advances a number of spaces equal to the price that you pay to place their marker.

The game is stream-lined with the money, this is a very good decision. The downside is that the routes are still too loose for my tastes, even with 5 at the table. We still had way too many open spaces on the board, and I think for this title to really shine it would need a more restrictive board with a flip-side variant for lower scales as well.

Still, a nice update to UP and for my money, superior to it in almost every way. There is nothing here that is going to convert you if you didn't like the other title, but I think it's a shade better because of the mild touch-ups.

Update: Ok, yeah, I'm pretty sure [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/675718/starting-scores-balanced]the starting airline scores are not balanced[/url]. But it's an easy fix (start them all at 9).

It's been so long since I played Union Pacific I can't even remember the differences, but it felt about as I remembered. Which is a solid game that scales well to 5, and plays in an hour (less than the printed time). There's still the randomness of not knowing when scoring is going to happen, which I'm not too crazy about, but it works for a light strategy game. I do have a concern about the huge support the small airlines get. It seems the pendulum has swung too far in that direction.

A more colourful and universally appealing economic game. Can support 2 players. More streamlined version of Union Pacific.  Components look fantastic aside from paper money. Orange and Red planes difficult to distinguish - maybe wait for next printing. Keith enjoyed when we played at Rumbletum Cafe. Not sure if it stands out enough to purchase - felt a little like TTR routes and cards, and Alhambra majority combined.

Why isn't this rated higher? 

Gee, you see bloatware like Caverna rated higher? Caverna is nothing more then a $100.00 group activity, AE is a classic, solid game.

The two issues with the game?

The red and orange planes can look alike on a crowded board, or under certain lighting. Take a black permanent black Sharpie and circle the orange planes's cowling. I can see how putting a ring around the plane isn't worth the effort to the publisher, would be tough to do. Just wished when issues like this pop up, they had to know during test play, add a line in the back of the rule book to "fix" it. This is on the same level as putting on stickers. So amazing people balk at slightly modifying a game, even if common sense dicatates it, it is as if it loses some value. They seem to want permission from the publisher. Hmmm, playability vs some imaged value lost. 

The end of round scoring is a little messy.

RATING: 8
When you first look at this colorful game by Alan Moon, your mind naturally thinks it's about skillful route building.  But it's actually more about set collection in a light stock market environment.

Players trade money to lay down plane routes, earning stock in various companies - every new route increases a stock's value.  Stocks can then be put into play in exchange for a little money - but often you'll need to pass on that option for the larger standard payout.  Three times during the game stocks are valued, with the majority player getting the most VPs.

This is a very accessible stock market game that provides growing tension and plenty of ways to plan your strategy.  I love the bright colors and the straight-forward rules.  This is a great choice for a group ready to move beyond a gateway game.

My first reaction: "Hey, this is Union Pacific with all the unsatisfying parts replaced!" After playing, I still think this is true, but it seems like a few of those bits have been replaced with differently unsatisfying parts.

But it may simply be that 3 is not a great player-count for this game; with more players I can imagine route blocking/contention being much more relevant - and there'd [i]definitely[/i] be more differentiation of scores for each airline, as 4th place drops off significantly faster than 3rd place does.

Components: Bad colors on the stock cards. White and gray; yellow and orange; orange and red; all too similar. Good quality cards. Flimsy money; might have been better with coins, for all the handling we give them. The board's routes are difficult to see, especially once airplanes are cluttering them up. The airplanes are cool. I like the map of Europe.

Experience: Pretty interesting. Most actions are satisfying. Passing to take 8 million is a significant enough chunk of change that it doesn't really feel like a pass. There are enough colors that only some are hottly contested, while others might be secure in the first place award, but not necessarily in the second place award. I don't recall much about Union Pacific but I think I'd prefer Airlines Europe.

I'm wondering if the smart thing to do is to just stockpile cash at the beginning? I wouldn't be foregoing many points for the first scoring.

This is a perfectly fine game, and it addresses some of the faults of Union Pacific, but it's still not as good as Union Pacific.  I like the new rules for gaining the master company stock, and may house-rule them into Union Pacific.  I dislike the various catch-up mechanisms injected into the game (handicapping small companies at the onset, the destination tickets for the four smallest companies), I dislike the varying costs to expand (it costs MORE to be the second company on a line?), I dislike the increasing payouts for companies, and I dislike third (and fourth and fifth) place payouts because they remove a lot of the tension and need to kee count of stocks.  A worthy effort, and still a very good game, but not a great one.

At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank. A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licenses that airline owns.

Here it is an "economic" game about the development of a portfolio of company shares that is still a family game.
The game is quite simple, requiring just one action between four options per turn, but is still challenging, as each player tries to have the majoraty of each company shares before each scoring round.
There is also an element of surprise, as a company route can be developed meanwhile there is a set collection of that company being build at the player´s hand that can suddenly appear at the table.
Great as a family game, party game and also suitable for (not so) hard gamers...

I finally got to play this game again after almost a year and was less excited by it. During the game, I let the other two players build the routes and simply played share cards on my turn. While I was never totally dominate in any one company, I earned points for all the airlines without being too heavily invested in anyone airline. For two scoring rounds, everyone ignored the Air Albatross action. It wasn't until just before the third scoring round where I ditched a single card for one Air Albatross share and ended up walking away with a huge number of points uncontested. The game is interesting but lacks any sort of negative effect on airlines stock. It's too easy to get caught doing the work to build routes and let other players leech off you. I would rate this game higher if the market had some sort of negative effect that can be used to prevent freeloaders.

It's quite similar to Alan R. Moon's : Ticket to Ride 
The strategy develops as a deduction game since the Stock Cards are numbered.
It's an easy game to learn & play and it plays within 1hr 1/2
It's harder in this game for people to feel frustrated by people blocking options to you and players can piggy back on someone's actions.
Overall the theme is nice and the mechanics do involve the theme.
While similar to TtR it is a completely different game.

I had high expectations and this game was a bit of a let down to be honest. I was expecting it to be as easy flowing as Ticket to ride but with a bit more strategy.

I don't know how much strategy is involved when 2 people are trying to win and a third person who isn't paying attention, doesn't like board games and just randomly picks places comes up to win.

Even when I did notice that she had a good start, there was little I could do to squash her and easy for her to mitigate it.

If the intent with Airlines Europe was to create an easier version of Union Pacific, then AE is a success.

In Union Pacific, money really is victory points. In Airlines Europe, money is money. You use it to buy airplanes to increase the value of a company, and you can take a turn to get more of it if you're running short. The availability of money makes the decision either to invest or to increase a company's value less consequential.

Also, the Airlines Europe board, unlike the one in Union Pacific, is not superfluous, as the values of the four smallest companies increase when certain connections on the AE board are completed.

I think I prefer Union Pacific because of the more difficult decisions, but I'll play either, and the two are similar enough that I don't see the need to own both.

A good, light introduction to a stock-taking game, getting players to understand they are not a certain color, but rather, they are investing in colors that are (hopefully, for them) performing the best. It's a good follow-up for someone who enjoys Ticket to Ride.

Great components with the little planes and a good-looking map. Scoring can take awhile, and we keep track with a pen and pad, but more importantly, keep scoring public to help keep games close.

As it's more of an intro game, there aren't a lot of super tight decisions or tension in game. Money is always pretty plentiful -- heck the game just gives you 8 million Euros at the end of each of your turns. And because stock shares come out randomly, it's usually pretty obvious which one will be the best pick. The randomness of the stock-share draw certainly adds some luck to the game as well.

This game is deceptively simple, even a newbie can grasp what you're trying to accomplish.  Your decisions are heavily influenced by those of your opponents.  Every game has come down to the wire.

Intriguing.  It's a little light, but I know there's strategy to the stock and route manipulation.  The scoring phases are a frustrating sort of bookkeeping.

Players expand different fictional airlines across Europe, and acquire shares in the airlines.  At random intervals, the shares pay out victory points.  About 20 years are Airlines came out, it's back (via Union Pacific and other games such as Reibach & Co.).  Mechanically very similar to the former games - either expand and take stock, or stall and declare stock.  A few differences here - money is now used to place aircraft, and you earn money by declaring stock (or taking a pure money turn).  Plays cleanly and feels more open than Union Pacific - probably due to the rail cards not hamstringing your strategy.  Production wise it's a bit disappointing - graphically it's very dull and looks quite amateurish, with no pop - a shame given the retro style, it could have been really stunning.  Also, the orange/red aircraft are very similar in colour and will cause confusion under less than ideal lighting.  Mixed bag, despite the Moonies lapping it up.

I had very high expectations for this game, but I just didn't find the decisions to be very interesting. I had heard that it combined TtR and Acquire, but IMO it takes the worst parts of those games instead of the best. For example:

1. It felt like a slow crawl to build up a hand of cards(instead of a race like TtR). You can only get one stock per turn, and then you have to take another turn to play it to your portfolio.
2. I had to pick from the available stocks  on display or take a random one (instead of picking any stock I wanted like Acquire).
3. Using an entire round to take money from the bank is often necessary, but very boring (instead of a tense trade-off like taking destination cards in TtR). 
4. Other than the special bonuses, the airline routes didn't have any clear purpose; their only value is in manipulating the stock price, so placing routes had a very random/abstract feel that didn't add any excitement to the game. 
5. The random draw scoring round cards are a little frustrating. It limits your ability to make stratigic decisions since you don't know how many round are left (instead of TtR and Acquire that give plenty of warning on when the end may be coming). 
6. None of the mechanics make sense thematically. TtR and Acquire have a few thematic issues, but nothing on this scale. Why does the bank just give you money? Why does buying a route license also give you a stock for free? Why does gaining a stock not automatically add it to your portfolio?  

My poor rating is based on a single 2-player game, so it might be better with more players or after more plays, but I just didn't feel like the decisions were very interesting.

Essentially, this is a revision to Union Pacific.  Map play is tighter, but maybe still not tight enough, although it will be family-friendly.  The game might tend to stall out at the end also, depending on the position of the final scoring card, but I'm told U.P. shared that same issue.  (You could create a variant where 5 cards are blindly discarded, and the final scoring card is then added to the remaining bottom 5).  I like how the card display is drafted away when scoring cards come up.  The A.A. (U.P.) stock in this game does not seem as worthwhile.  Compared to U.P. or Acquire, this version wins out in the end, by just a little.  The little planes are cool, and the retro look of the shares is cool too.  The box cover, however....  not so cool.  The money denominations and constant change-making with the VPs is a real annoyance.  Red and orange are far too close in color.  So there are some "user interface" issues.  But still, a game well worth owning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Excellent.  Blows Ticket to Ride out of the water.  I love the stock aspect, and the alternative stock you can use to mitigate bad luck with the cards that are out.  The only complaint I have with the game is the similar color of red and orange planes, which is minor to say the least. A top game in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The family resemblance to TTR is obvious. Four simple action choices are available, of which a player can take only one each turn. Light, appropriate artwork and plastic, brightly-colored tokens eventually cover the board. But Airlines uses a stock market mechanism, which adds an additional layer of complexity over TTR, giving a different playing experience. Both are fun and worth having.

[b][FirstPlayOn27thJan2012][/b] I played the game for the first time (it was a 5p game), and I instantly got hooked. Planned to grab a copy for my collection as I thought it would be a good 6 players game (which is true). As I sometimes play game with my mom, I was hoping the two-player experience is going to be fun.

Fast forward couple of months, I borrowed this game from a friend to try it with my mom. We tried it once and it wasn't that good. Two-player game took longer than I expected, and it feels very repetitive. I noticed that in a two-player game, players were just trying to halt to not draw the stock cards. 

More players (especially with six), the game shines. With more players, the game seems to run a lot quicker and the play of different stocks from players make the game more fun, as players are trying to be the majority to be in the running for the VP scoring.

Bár ugye Union pacific alapok, de alapvetően nagyon más játék. Eleve nem 2-6, hanem csak 2-5 személyes. Másképp lehet az extra részvényekhez jutni. 5 lapból választunk, nem 4-ből. Pénzt is kell szerezni, (erre a részvény lejátszás ill. egy külön akcióval van lehetőségünk) amiből aztán tudunk majd légi -útvonal- engedélyeket venni az egyes rep társaságoknak. Csak 3 értékelő kör van a 4 helyett. És itt pontokat gyűjtünk: az értékeléskor szerezzük őket. (NA igen ez azért a pénznek ugye más szerepe.)
Szóval bár van sok hasonlóság, de jelentős eltérések is, nem tagadhatja le rokonát, de ettől még nagyon más.
Ami viszont megmaradt: a nagyon váratlan befejezés.
Ez sajnos terveket dönthet meg, és emiatt némi szerencse lesz.
Itt is van ugyan egy alternatív kártya összerakás, de szerintem az UP spec kártya összerakása jobb volt.
Szóval összességében jó játék, nekem tetszik, fog még előkerülni. 
Egyszerű szabályai miatt pedig kezdőknek is kellemes játék lehet.
Update: most olvastam, h a kiadó -Abacus- tesztelte tovább még a játékot, h 6 személyes legyen, és igen játszható 6 személlyel: 2 változtatás kell hozzá: 1. 6 felcsapott kártya van 5 helyett, és 2. kezdetben 6 lapot kap mindenki, nem 8-at. Jó hír
Update: a 2 kieggel együtt is jó, a blokkolás eddig túl sok mindent nem adott hozzá érdemben -drágítja az utat, de nem szokott komoly gondot okozni, kérdés több játék után arra ráérzünk-e.
A plusz bónusznak több jelentősége van, még 2 útvonalért jár pont, több légitársaságot érdemes bevinni, illet emiatt több kavarodás lehet, de hatása nem oly nagy, azt hiszem.

It's cool as a hybrid between Ticket to Ride and Alhambra, with building planes of different colors and trying to get the majority in each color before the scoring rounds.  But without the ticket mechanic of Ticket to Ride, there's no real competition or much strategy when building the planes- you just kinda build wherever's convenient.

This one is interesting. We played it only several times so far. You boost different companies, for which you get shares. You try to get monopoly in some of the companies, but at the same time, be present in all other companies. Quite nice game, and it doesn't take too much time to play.

my uber-gaming game collecting addict hubby snuck this remake into the house undetected and we played it over Christmas break... i have won this game six times in a row....and i really enjoy it - it ranks high with 7W... but not just because i'm very successful in it (the scoring tends to be pretty close)  the game is a bit stressful (read: a nail biter) because players don't precisely know how they are doing point-wise until the final reveal.  it's similar to ticket to ride, but with the twist of 'stock ownership' and the spin that it is cooperative whilst being competitive.  high replay-ability and excitement factors earn this a ten for me at this point in time... would play it anytime!

Players contest a limited number of share cards in a number of colours, attempting to have the majority share as the value of each airline company (colour) increases.

I've never played Union Pacific or the original Airlines so I've nothing to compare Airlines Europe with. That said, I like it! The game plays quickly, much faster than the 75 minutes it says on the box. And the decisions are tense ... by which I mean you always feel that the action you just took is the wrong one. :) 

But it may be a hard game to figure out initially. Inexperienced players may take a while to grasp the connection between building routes and gathering stock. This may be a theme vs. mechanics simulation issue.

What a fun way to spend a Sunday afternoon.  Everybody enjoyed this game.  It was easy to learn and fun to play.  We put sleeves on the cards straight away, and one player said he preferred that as it made the cards easier to sort.  They will get a lot of use so seemed to make sense.  In this game, buying routes bids up the value of the respective airlines.  There are lots of options per turn, and the balance amongst the options seems right;  it was not the case that one was always notably more compelling than another.  [With regard to the sleeves, started with the FF sleeves but they were slightly too large and protruded above the level of the box inset when the cards were in their slot.  The Mayday 125% 56mm x 87 mm fit perfectly.  (Sometimes the 100% and 125% fit slightly differently.)]

Very good game where you always have more to do than you have turns to do it in. This makes for some satisfying, tense game play. However, I find the 2 player variant a bit clunky. Definite similarities to Acquire. The theme and presentation for this game is so much more delicious. Not a fan of the 3 scoring phases 'cuz they stop the game dead in it's tracks. Maybe repeat plays will speed up this very annoying mechanic.

When I heard Union Pacific was going to be rethemed and re-released as AE, I just assumed it would be better. I'm not sure it is, however. At first, I liked the way money is used to lay planes instead of the somewhat confusing track cards of UP. I thought that was an improvement in that it added the element of tempo to your actions, but in hindsight I think I prefer the track cards. One, the decision for tempo isn't all that interesting as the times to spend money/get money pretty much present themselves (not a very difficult decision), and two, the track cards added some tension in that you might not be able to build somewhere. 

Now, I can see that removing the track cards would give control back to players so they wouldn't feel screwed by some bad card draws, but the net effect has been that it's too easy. If the deck isn't blocking people by not giving them the cards they need, then other players should, but here it's too easy to place planes. The board doesn't offer much interesting tension except for the bonus routes. Once they're all claimed, looking at the board for planning purposes feels pointless.

A contest of routebuilding and out collecting majority presence in 11 stock choices. After playing Chicago Express I find it odd that the stocks, the dividends and the routebuilding are completely disconnected; call it personal expectations.

Given Ticket to Ride and this I'd choose this one.

This is a very good game. It's a lot like Acquire in that you buy stock trying to take control of airlines, scoring points instead of money. Yet it's easier than Acquire since you aren't limited to place in just six positions on the board. It also doesn't feel as much of a efficiency optimization race game as Jet Set or Mesopotamia seem to be. It's also a bit more accessible (and very much more available) than Union Pacific which is its direct ancestor. Very satisfying.

This is the game that made me realize that majority-control games kinda drive me nuts.  I like games where I can focus on my own engine and I always feel kinda bad when I take a majority from somebody else and feel a bit affronted when they have to do the same to me.

This is Union Pacific rethemed to an airlines game (which is what Union Pacific was a re-theme of!) with a bit of added complexity. I actually think the added complexity makes this game *less* interesting, and I liked the routes in Union Pacific better.

This feels like a spiced-up version of ticket to ride. Whereas in ticket to ride a lot of turns can be boring when you are searching for certain types of cards, in this game every turn is exciting. The stocks keep you interested in what every other player is doing and no card is ever useless. Even though this isn't my favorite type of game I really enjoy playing this one.

Airlines Europe is one of the better stock market themed games I've played yet. It was less complex than I was expecting, but the decisions are meaningful, and I appreciate the importance of the spatial aspect of the game. It was a lot more like Ticket to Ride than I had thought it would be, with the same feeling of racing to cut off routes that other people are building as they are in the process of trying to increase the stock value of certain airlines. I wouldn't say the game exceeded my expectations, but it certainly met them, and I'm looking forward to bringing this out again soon.

RATING: 6
Move over Ticket to Ride, there's a game out that I actually want to play and uses most of your mechanics. Good route making/shareholding game. The stocks give this a much more interesting level of play than Ticket to Ride and make you feel like you have some control over the game rather than holding on and hoping the cards give you something good. The game is quick and there is definitely random luck in the game, but for a light more family level game that is not a bad thing.

Airlines Europe fits in somewhere in between Ticket to Ride and Chicago Express, although much closer to the former. That probably makes it a nice introduction to shareholding games.

Airlines Europe doesn't introduce anything new into the word of gaming, but what mechanics it does employ it uses extremely well.  The route building / stock buying mash-up is well balanced in this game. It gets a bit much sometimes having to keep track of what everybody else is doing, and the scoring rounds are a wee-bit finicky, but such things are forgivable.  I personally enjoy this more than Ticket to Ride.

Excellent!  Though this style of stock control game was foreign to me, I had an easy time teaching it to my family.  The flow of the game is very intuitive and the dual activities of building up the airlines while collecting stocks and "piggybacking" off of the top valued airlines for points is very satisfying.  It'll be interesting to see how this game evolves with repeated plays, as I'm already getting a sense that the timing of control turn-overs can be planned in a more shrewd manner than what we're doing now.

The initial deck setup is my only minor hang-up with the game.  I can never remember how it's done.  There's lots of "take a quarter stack of this, half a stack of that, put this on the bottom of that stack" and so forth and the abbreviated "easy" setup leads to some wonky timing of the scoring cards.

I may print up a quick setup aid just for that.

I do like this game but it tenses me - I find it hard to manage the share aspect of the game against my own airlines. I never seem to know which airline to build on.

Two player game is frustrating with the air abacus cards. There is no way you can be first in the last round with the fake player added in so what is the point in trying for the majority?

Greatest stock game played out on a map, using airlines rather than trains. A bit more interesting and deep than Acquire. Easy to teach, but compelling gameplay.

Very enjoyable game of stock holding from the creator of the acclaimed Ticket to Ride series. This one is a bit more complex than TtR, but still in the light/medium range. Tension is high with those elusive scoring cards that can appear at any moment. Great for light gamers and for those who are looking for something more substantial. Highly recommended!

Small update: the game plays very well with 6 players too! Just use the official rules posted by Abacusspiele and everything works flawlessly!

We played Airlines a lot back in the day.  The new edition tightens the game and brings it bang up to date - I like the tuning, makes it faster while retaining some of the decision-making angst.  There is some dilution though with the play on a route/play a share card decision with the money cycle which is the point of difference.  Hard to see airlines getting blocked too.  The sheer weight of competent games now being released will make it difficult for it to have the same impact as it did then.

The original Airlines and Union Pacific were fun because of the tension between expanding the companies (and grabbing that stock you really need) and getting the stock played before the scoring card arrives. Airlines Europe removes this tension by forcing you into an artificial cycle where you must spend your money to get stocks, then play your stocks to get more money, then spend the money to get more stocks, etc.

And that's boring.

I also don't like the way that your income is tied to the number of cards you play. In my first game, one of my opponents was dealt six cards of one airline. That was "Game Over" right from the opening hand, because she earned twelve dollars when she played them all at once.

Sadly, slow and lumbering. It is a cross between Ticket to Ride and Acquire, which are both great games, and it preserves the tension of both, but only in the last 1/3.

I really like the theme and the idea of this game, but I couldn't keep it in my collection.

I think this game is a very good combination of Ticket to Ride and Aquire. So far I've always had fun even when I lost the game. It seems that with 3 players you need to win the AA battle, but if two players compete for that too much then the 3rd player can sneak in and win by focusing on the airlines that are farthest advanced.

Delightful stock game. Similar commodity speculation seen in other games, Airlines also give more control over increasing the value of certain airlines. The game requires you to "piggy back" on airlines. Alan Moon is a good job of balancing the potential worth of an airline vs what a player is able to affect. You have to have your hands in all the cookie jars, here.

Initial rating an 8 because I think this game will be very valuable as an alternative to Settlers/Carc/TtR when playing with people who don't play a lot of games, but I can also see the competition getting very vicious with more experienced players.

I'm not sure that this is such an ideal substitute for TtR because the concept of "ownership" is a little tough for new players.  Still, I'm happy with this one in my collection.

Very good improvement of the old Airlines / Union Pacific mechanism.  The basic game is very similar to it's predecessor but the building part has been partly redesigned.  Players do not need special building cards anymore; instead, building lines has to be paid with money.  This makes playing faster and more flexible.  All in all an excellent refinement of an already great game.

The board doesn't seem to do much in this game. I guess I prefer "Acquire" to this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's tempting to compare this game to "Ticket to Ride", due to the similar theme, the route building and the same designer, but it's more akin to "Acquire". You take shares of various airline companies and increase their value by placing airplanes on the board. You try to extend routes to reach certain cities for a bonus increase or some points on the edge of the map for the same effect, but there is practically no competition for routes or blocking. Scoring is based on majorities in shares.

The companies differ in number of shares, which is also the number of available airplanes, which adds some interest to the gameplay. However, there is just too much randomness. Often you want to invest in some company, but no such card is available on your turn. Meanwhile, cards from a company on which you were investing are grabbed by another player and there is nothing you can do to keep your lead. The time of scoring and the end of the game are also determined by card draws, adding an undesirable push-your-luck element.

I was mildly entertained during my only play, and the plastic airplanes in multiple colors look pretty on the board. It may be a decent family game, but it's a little repetitive and, as I said, just too random.

Really an elegantly designed beauty of a game. Feels very Classic and a wonderful step up from Ticket to Ride. Careful not to introduce brand new gamers to this as it seems to me to be a next step game. Some area control mechanics in a stock building game with a board. The board is a bit secondary to the stocks. Love how you can really let other people do your dirty work for you, but there is tension in the timing of when to lay down a monster hand of stocks. Must have next step game. Will never trade it away.

A fun game that is good for the family.  It is not too heavy and good for even novice players but has some decent strategy in that decision making is not always straight forward.  My only concern however, is that overtime it will become clear that there are relative few strategies (e.g. buy a little of each).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I only played the game once and really enjoyed it. I like the different choices you have during your turn and how paying attention to other stocks people have can be helpful. It's also cool how when you see a face up stock that you want, it helps to encourage you to buy a plane or two just so you can grab the stock. 

The scoring takes awhile, but other than that, it's a fun game. I'm not too hung up on super speedy games anyway, so a few extra minutes of scoring isn't the end of the world.

This reminds me of Ticket to Ride and Paris Connection. It's a bit more complex than those. I like that you're not certain when the scoring happens and there's always that tension between getting more shares and putting them in front of you. (1.3.2017)

An ok game. It feels it's complex just for the sake of complexity, because it doesn't feel any more deeper than TTR despite there being more moving parts. That makes it so that it's too complex for non-gamers and way too light for my gamer friends. (23.11.17)

Airlines Europe (AE) feels like a crossover between Acquire and Ticket to Ride. At it's simplest, AE is a game of shares. Like Acquire, you have the option of increasing the valuation of particular stocks and also acquiring additional stocks (in a TTR ticket-draw manner). However, 'owning' stocks requires that you take a turn to play them from your hand (making money in the process), and has a small bit of set collection that is rewarded accordingly (i.e., you can play as many stock of one colour as you have in one turn, or any two stocks). While certainly more family friendly than Acquire, I do miss a bit of the tension that the very limited spatial placement creates -- instead, in AE, you can place airlines literally anywhere, so long as the air route is not blocked (which, unlike TTR, is a bit more difficult to achieve in practice). Overall, good game that I'd be willing to play with 4 players who can keep a game moving as I'm almost always a fan of games that encourage collusion and provide somewhat uncertain valuations.

Light game, suitable for casual gamers and families. Lots of fun and will play in less that an hour after a few plays. 

Rules are simple, and aftera while turs go so quickly that there is no feeling of downtime. Components are good. Overall, a good and quick stock based game with lots of interesting decisions. There is quite a bit of strategy, and the experienced player will beat the newbie. With players are at the same level, I believe scoring will typically be very tight, as there is a rather limited game depth.

THIS is the game Union Pacific aspired to be. Gone are the annoying track cards, and the Abacus stock (This game's version of Union Pacific stock) is no longer just an automatic grab. The result is a game with all the best parts of Union Pacific and none of the chaff. It has to be said that the board placement seems even less important than before, but that's fine as it lets you focus more fully on the meat of the game--the stock play. So for me this totally eclipses Union Pacific and is a good stock game in its own right. 

There is one caveat, though: you'll have to tolerate a surprising amount of fiddlyness and housekeeping. The deck must be seeded properly, and you'll probably want to assign different players to banker, VP distributor, stock marker mover, and so on. For some, the nuisance will be small, but for me it was enough to bump the game down just a bit from an 8 to a 7. Still, a fun game, and one I look forward to playing more.

RATING: 7.5
On a first play I can already see that this easily exceeds TTR in play, in interest and challenge, probably won't take much longer to actually play, and has really cool bits!

Seriously, this is an excellent little stock valuation agme, with lots of options for your one action per turn. While it would be interesting to compare this with Union Pacific, I probably won't feel the need- this is a really nice package.

About the only thing in the whole production that's a little skimpy is the VP counters provided- at least in the base game I always seem a little shy at the end.  But everything else is appealing, and besides using poker chips instead of paper money, this game has fantastic production values.

So based on a single 4-player solo game I'm starting this at 7.25 - this is about the best Alan R Moon game I have played, with the possible exception of Capitol.

I am revising this up to a 7.5 after 5 plays, especially adding the Flight Ban expansion.

Very keen to play this, I think also it looks as though it could be a gentle way to push family members into stock games (which generally sit on the shelf) think Chicago express!

Played it now. It's not that family friendly since shares, board, box and stuff totalled up it's a squeeze on a kitchen table. It's tactics are also a bit more acute than TTR so to someone not used to investment games it may seem that theres no real target to be played for (as with the TTR tickets)

I found the game to be reasonable. I'd play it again but Chicago express delivers the same idea but better in every way.

This is supposedly a retheme of Union Pacific, but aside from the "Union Pacific" shares, now Abacus Air, this feels like a totally new game.

Gone are the track cards, which restricted building of links in UP. In Airlines: Europe, you simply buy a link connecting two cities by paying a progressively increasing cost. Each link may accommodate up to two or three different airline companies, but after that other airlines will be blocked out.

Up to two links (of two different airlines) can be built with cash, and then the player can claim one share of stock of any airline that is in the stock market, or draw blind from the deck. It takes a separate action to get that share out of hand and onto the table as part of his "portfolio".

The cost of the link directly affects the "index" value of the stock. What is difficult to grasp is that the stock is not increasing in monetary value, but in the ability to generate VPs. As the airline's network is expanded (the network must be contiguous), the airline's stock "index" increases, pushing it into stacked regions of successively increasing VP payout schedules. As in UP, there are three randomly occurring scoring rounds. For each airline, players will score to some non-linear VP schedule, depending on who has the most stocks "played", such as "8-4-2-1-0". The majority holder gets 8 VP, second place gets 4 VP, and so on. In this regard, it is similar to Acquire, but the payout is in VP, not cash.

Cash can be raised by simply playing out stock, either all of one airline, or one stock each of two different airlines, at a rate of $2/stock. Another option is to get $8, but no other benefit. Playing out a lot of one airline's stock doesn't has no correlation to VP. Yes, the cash has been extracted, but the cash mush now be converted into links to increase the stock index value to generate greater VP. Having one share more can mean a huge VP swing, within the context of one airline.

Relatively worthless stock can be converted to the Abacus "super-stock" at 1:1 or 3:2 ratios. The Abacus Airline has its own relatively generous VP payout schedule, but is dependent on the scoring round.

I have always enjoyed Alan Moon's non-linear thinking and approach to game design, such as Oasis, Elfenland, and TTR. He manages to come up with a truly unique game mechanism in every design that literally blows my mind. A:E is no different, as it has a multitude of difficult and delicious choices each round, where each player feels like they are pulled in five or six different directions! Raising cash is necessary to build links and increase the value of stock. Stock can be played to generate cash, but  play all of one company or piecemeal? Or take a large lump sum? Or do you convert stock into the superstock? What is mind-boggling is that the links you play, don't necessarily have to be related to the stock you pick. You want majority in a given airline, but you don't want to play out too many stocks, as this dis-incentivizes others from helping improve your airline. You can't improve the stock, without paying for links. You can't generate cash, without playing out stock. You want to do it all, but you only have one action per turn! Having only four possible actions means literally no downtime; play is lightning fast.

The game is deceptively easy to learn, fast to play, but there is a depth and richness of the game waiting to be uncovered. This seems to be a "classic" design. Will it prove to be as popular and ubiquitous as TTR? Only time will tell. Initial rating is an '8', but it could go either way with more plays. I am concerned that this has a short half-life, or maybe it doesn't. Looking forward to more plays.

This superficially appears similar to Ticket To Ride but in fact I think it is most similar to Aquire and Alhambra.  It has the share purchasing and value increasing idea from Aquire and the idea that you need to watch the market and buy what you need when it comes up from Alhambra.  The resemblance to TTR is mostly visual, although you do get an advantage to building colour based sets of cards in your hand it is not as important a feature as in TTR.

I think this game as replaced Aquire for me.  While Aquire still has some features this game does not on balance I think I prefer AE.  It's a little bit longer and more complex than TTR so some times I think TTR will still be the right game to play. Alhambra has significant additional features (for instance managing your currency and planning your alhambra) that ensure it will be a valid option.

I'm surprised this game isn't easier to get hold of.  It really should be in the shops alongside TTR and Catan.  I got the German version which has language free components so simply printing out the English rule book from BGG meant I have a fully localised game.

A stock collecting game that is fun to play.

For some reason, I haven't played it very much with 5, but it does 5 players quite well. The value of the stock increases as players build more planes of that color on the board. There are three payouts during the game. Even if you don't have the most stock, you still can get something from the payout. Ties are added together and averaged, rounding up. It creates some interesting tension.

The routes are more open, it's unlikely that you'll be completely boxed in, even with five players. Still some luck-of-the-draw in the shares that come off the stock, but the bonus shares are more difficult to obtain this time. A much tighter game all round than UP.

RATING: 7
I'm not a huge fan of Union Pacific (I like it fine, I just don't love it), and the changes to this game don't really change my feelings about it in either direction.  The removal of the track cards simplifies things a little, but it's replaced by a weird money mechanism, which makes the game feel a little slower because players need to keep taking time out of their route building in order to finance it.  The game's probably a little shorter.  I don't think it's especially easier or more difficult to learn. On the whole, it's probably a good substitute for UP, which is out of print and expensive.

Same designer as Ticket to Ride and you can tell.  Decent stock management game.  Probably too long for what it is.  Scoring points takes forever because the point tokens have to be constantly exchanged for higher denominations, which is extremely tedious and annoying.

This sat on my shelves for over a year without getting played. I'm so glad I got it to the table now, it's a great game. It's simple and I like the tension and excitement there is when you don't know if you get another turn before the next scoring comes up. It can be mean, you have to sometimes block your opponents to get the upper hand.

8 -> 6 -> 5
Wow, I'm surprised by how much my enthusiasm for this game has faded.  It seemed very promising, but now I really have no desire to play it.  I think the game would be much more interesting if the routes played a larger role, but as it stands the only interesting choices are which airline to expand and which shares to take - where you put the planes really has little to no bearing on the game (except for the smaller airlines, but being blocked from getting the bonus is a very rare occurrence).  I think this was my biggest disappointment with the game, as I originally assumed it was like Ticket to Ride with a stock holding angle which I think would actually make an interesting game.  Also, the strategy does not vary much from game to game, so it's really more of an exercise in tactics and VP maximization relative to the other players.  I think this one will eventually go on the chopping block.

Best with 4. This game is great to teach a lot of basic gaming concepts to kids and people new to gaming. 
Unfortunately the board representation is not great (as in ticket to ride) and every single time I find someone new to the game thinking the planes are supposed to move on the board. 
Another issue is the paper money. Terrible option and should be replaced with poker chips or something similar. 
The scoring is a bit boring as well. 

It is still a pretty decent gateway game but I had to let my copy go.

This is from Alan Moon and I'm a huge fan of the Ticket to Ride games, so I was very interested to play this game. It's actually not a lot like TtR, as you are building routes to advance airlines which you are trying to invest in. In some ways it's a bit like rummy, in that you are trying to collect the most of each airline to gather points. I like this a lot and am glad it came back into print.

Had to get this having seen a photo of the planes in an article on Ars Technica. Picked it up from Blue Highway games in Seattle whilst on holiday in Northwest Pacific USA this summer. What a great game, definitely a step up from Acquire which I also enjoy. Played so far with 4 and 5 players but I had downloaded the instructions from BGG for a 6 player variant which will probably get chance to play with my group. Alan R Moon I salute you!

Alan Moon's very solid take on Acquire. IMO Airlines Europe is more forgiving than Acquire, so better for casual play or families but less tense/exciting for gamers.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (September 2011)

I generally dislike Days of Wonders games, I think they are very pretty and very well done but they are very shallow for my tastes. Airlines Europe is the exception that confirms the rule. I still feel Airlines is somewhat lighter than I generally prefer. It has resemblances to Acquire (stock management),  Alhambra (score system) and obviously Ticket to Ride (airplane network).  What I really like about the game is the felling that you have to do everything, play routes, place stocks, gain money but you can only do ONE thing at a time (a la Agricola) and you are never sure when the next score is. Lots of tough choices in the game. It has luck but it can be managed with good tactical play.

I think it has to be played with at least 4 players to create really hard choices. With 3 players you can always have one stock and be assured you won some VPs.

I have not played Union Pacific YET so I can’t compare them.

On the bad side I don´t like that you can earn money playing stocks from your hand, this feel way too random as you can easily start with more than 4 cards of the same airline and thus you have an unfair advantage over your opponents, ALSO the orange miniature planes are too similar to the red ones.

In conclusion my favorite Days of Wonders game as of today.

Nowadays I am much more harsher with my ratings, so I have to downgrade Airlines Europe rating to a one I feel matches my current feelings toward the game with the BGG rating system. It`s been a long time since I last played it, but (for some reason) I don’t feel any compulsion to play it.

This stock game plays largely as I remember Union Pacific playing.  It was fun for one play but I think it would overstay its welcome with me quickly.  In particular we had a hard time really pulling ahead of each other in our game so it seemed to be an hour of decisions leading us just about back to where we started.

The money system does nothing but slow down the design.  I like the fact that the 'sabotage' markers are gone from the original Airlines, but the game still does not have the same appeal as Union Pacific (which I feel is superior).

Not knowing when the scoring rounds will occur adds a great layer of suspense. Airlines Europe is a wonderful achievement that is sure to be a hit with a wide audience.

An okay stock investing game, I found the luck of the draw somewhat punishing. You can always trade less useful stock for the special stock, assuming you can build an early lead with them.

Ticket to Ride meets Acquire.  Used to be a top 5 game in my collection.

RATING: 4
There's a potentially good game buried in there somewhere, but on top of it are extremely heavily flooding money, scoring system that is too advantageous to the players in the early stages of playing order, angstful graphical layout, badly drawn map, stupid airline names, and repetitive gameplay. The most tension the game is able to create as it is takes place when new cards are put to the card display and that's not a good sign. You could play this game a lot faster by simply dealing all the cards out to the players openly at the beginning of the game and then people would just take turns putting airplanes to the board and in the end count the points.

Nice family eurogame from the creator of Ticket to Ride. It's a liitle heavier than the game of the train theme and exploits the theme of airplanes. It uses some interesting mechanics similar to Imperial 2030 and plays relatively fast.

RATING: 5.5
Cool card play and money management; I however feel the game falls flat in the too-direct relationship between investing in a company and increasing its value. More objectives (like, a crapload more) would have made this much more interesting, I feel.

Excellent family game,if you like TTR you will like this,the wife prefers this to TTR i slightly prefer TTR but both excellent family games and this plays in about 60 mins from start to finish.   
Edit after plenty of plays and with the little presidents expansion I now prefer Airlines Europe to Ticket to ride, it's just so smooth and as family game friendly as you can get.
Love this game.

2015-01-18 - Very good game. Improved Union Pacific, but not improved as much that I wouldn't like to play UP. Still I think I prefer Airlines Europe. I don't like rounding up during draws and I think we will home rule it to rounding down.

2015-07-25 - Rounding down draws is necessary. I don't like home rules, but this one is a must. 

2015-10-19 - 8->7 - After all it's not that good to me, but still pretty good game. And after rethinking I prefer Union Pacific, but they are very close to each other.

Really enjoy this as a lighter stock game, the theme is great for introducing new players to deeper games.

Simple enough to teach to newer players but deep enough to keep experienced gamers interested.

Very fun game but perhaps a bit long.  Takes awhile to accumulate cards.  Everyone should know what they are doing in advance, but players still take awhile.  Maybe using poker chips instead of the paper money included would help, with $4 chips and $8 chips (when you drop two cards into your portfolio you get $4, and one option is to take $8 from the bank).  If this game could be played in an hour it would be the perfect game.

I had played Union Pacific 8 times, but more than 8 years previous, before I played Airlines Europe.  So the play of Airlines Europe is clearly a refinement of the U.P. system.  I enjoyed it.  There is nothing all that new here.  I own it for now.  But it isn't the sort of game I feel I need to own.

Very disappointed in this one. I enjoy Ticket to Ride but this one lacked tension. Choices felt obvious of what stocks to take, what routes to build. Played with three, but even with five players I really don't see the tension. Everyone is going to get points one way or another. To make matters worse, the game is way too long for what it is, an exercise of repetitiveness with no calculating thinking.

A solid set collection/speculation game. Gain stocks of different airline companies and speculate on whether or not you can keep the majority in them. Players have cards in their hands that represent shares in different airline companies, on their turns they build up the companies and gain shares in them hoping to come out on top. Nothing that makes me rave about it, just solid run of the mill gaming fun.

Reibach & Co is still the best game in this game family, but Airlines Europe is also a good game. Some interesting decisions, interaction and quick playing time are plusses.

Nice design similar to Ticket to Ride. Every turn there were many things I wanted to do, but you can only pick one. That can be frustrating, but it keeps the game very well balanced and tense because you're always worried that you won't be able to do what you put off this turn. Hard to accurately judge who's winning and there were lots of surprises due to players' secret machinations. The final scores were quite close. Definitely would play again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very cool investment type game that has a small amount of suspense built into the game because you don't know if you will have the most stock in an airline or if another player will. The components are high quality and the little planes are great! 

If you like light, investment type games I highly recommend this game.

RATING: 8.5
After many plays I still love TTR USA and I'd like to get a few more titles from Alan R Moon.  This seems like a great candidate.

I'm really liking this game a lot and it seems a very logical progression from TTR.  Some of the elements are there but this game is very different.  Strategy and difficulty are a little higher.  It remains easy to teach but the goal is a little more opaque since the game doesn't present it to you openly. (In TTR you get tickets saying "connect these two points," in airlines its just, "get the most points")

Overall I see this as a replacement for TTR for me.  I still love TTR and won't turn it down, but if I have people capable of playing this I would choose it instead.

Better than Union Pacific that's for sure, but it wouldn't be bad to streamline it a bit more. There is so many little components and things going on here and there, that it ruins to smoothines here.

I haven't played the original Airlines or Union Pacific so I can't tell how it compares. But it's a fine game of shares and connections that is almost good as a gateway; it works perfectly as a next step after games like Ticket to Ride.

Halfway between Ticket to ride & Chicago express.  Fairly simple but more rich than TTR with the same level of chance & accessibility.  The components are nice and the game is easily enjoyed by a wide range of players.  Shares and company controls spice things up, creating fun tension and friendly competition.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy Union Pacific so this is highly similar, except for at least two major upgrades.  I love how smoothly the game now runs/administrates with the stock charts of tracking the price of each stock (airline).  Also, another major improvement is how the tactical board of adding lines and extending an airlines stock value is much better than U.Pacific.

However, there is one aspect of U.P. that I prefer and I would want to incorporate into Airlines Europe, and that is to have 4 Scoring Rounds (instead of three).  And, I would use the advanced rules of U.P. with equally weighted stacks when preparing the deck.  Overall, an excellent and streamlined implementation of Union Pacific... packing an already good game with the same punch in less time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I definitely prefer UP over this one.  The payouts are too generous in this one and encourages a bit too much diversity.  I prefer the fight for first/second in UP where it is all or nothing.  This is a kinder/gentler game.

LIKES:

* I do appreciate the money aspect of the game that pressures board play.  I think I would like to see the board perhaps be even more tight though.
* I like the planes!
* The way the scoring works based on where the marker is at on the value track which is based on flight license values paid I like.  I'm uncertain if I like how much gets paid out for 3rd, 4th, and possibly even 5th!
* The AA stock (ie UP stock) can be acquired via discarding both played and hand cards!

DISLIKES:

* I wish there was another way to acquire stock other than placing "track", er, buying flight licenses.
* When the final scoring doesn't happen soon into the final 11 cards, the final few rounds makes the game feel stagnated.
* With so many of the airlines paying out points for first through fourth place, there seemed little point to acquiring AA stock once someone took a commanding lead.  Why give up points and actions to acquire less points?
* I think this one has to be played with 5.  Any less and the board play becomes totally meaningless.  At least with 5 there is some chance of airlines getting locked out of expansion opportunities.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent stock manipulation Euro game. In my limited experience the board play is not as tense as the stock race.  There are usually several routes that one can choose that are all beneficial with only slight differences.  Only the four smallest companies actually have specific destinations to achieve.  It is very rare that I feel pressure to build with a certain airline just to avoid being cut off.  The stock portion of the game is much more tense.

Much better with 4 players than with 2 players. 

The game is almost too "nice": It is borderline impossible to lock an airline out of achieving their bonus lines. For that reason you have to focus on small airlines - they are superior. And also for that reason, the board becomes uninteresting. Any airline can do whatever it wants. 

The game shines in the stock taking department, with the constantly nerve-wrecking decision: play now, or collect more stock and hope dividends are not paid before your next turn.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light stock game where you are given a number of shares at the beginning of the game.  You then can acquire shares and expand a network, gather money or turn in shares for an airline that only scores when scoring cards come out.  

There are three scoring cards in the game.  It is a light family weight game with a good theme.  It is not yet another train game.  Components are very nice as well. 

Good game but just short of excellent.  It is a little too light for my taste.

A well adjusted version of Union Pacific. This title takes the stuff that gets criticized in the old version and changes it up a bit. It's still the game of simple mechanics and angsty decisions. Those things about the old version didn't bother me though. I enjoy this one almost as much as its predecessor but the fact that trains are way cooler than planes leaves me liking Union Pacific just a little better.

I enjoy this game better than both Acquire and Ticket to Ride.  It has similarities to both games while retaining a different feel.  It separates scoring into 3 manageable chunks.  Which is a great improvement to Acquire's arduous final scoring.  I enjoy it more than Ticket to Ride because there is "more meat on its bones".  It is a deeper game for folks who are ready to graduate from gateway games.  Thumbs up!

10-28-12-hadn't played this in 10 months! David (pfctsqr) inquired about the game which is why we played tonight.  much more fun as 2p than 3p for us, since 3p games always end up with Casey and Miles battling for Air Abacus and I diversify and win.  We'll be getting this out more often as 2p.  Think it got swept aside due to the 'cult of the new'.  

12-22-11-We will never tire of this game.  It's too much fun!

12-9-11-3p game!  I managed to come in last but it was so much fun!  Casey loved it.  Of course, he won.  

12-5-11-Awesome game!  Miles says it's the best one yet!  Too bad I spent so long thinking it was an airlines version of TtR and glad I finally realized it's an economic game.  Lots of fun, can't wait to play a 3p game w/Casey.

12-1-11-Played learning game just to first scoring round since I was having trouble wrapping my mind around the rules.  I know it's supposed to be simple...but it's also very different from others we've played.  Anyway, Miles immediately stated that he thinks it's a 'winner'!  So it is!  Can't wait till we have time for a full game.

Nice and promising game after two plays. The complexity is one big step above Ticket to Ride, but everything "clicks" around the time of the first evaluation. We enjoyed it, although it will take a few games to start fine-tuning actions and tactics to be able to make the most victory-points-efficient choice at one's turn.

A great game with a theme that doesn't feel tacked on. It's a game about investing in airline companies that provide the player with good options each and every turn. However, after playing it a couple of times, I just don't see my gaming group picking it up anytime soon. There's nothing bad about the game, but there's nothing that really grabs you such that you'd want to play it over and over again.

RATING: 7.8
We had to make an adjustment for the two-player game so that the person who has the second-most number of stocks doesn't get quite as many points. Without that change, the balance of the two-player game is broken. You shouldn't be able to put down a single stock in a color and get almost as many points as the person in first place.

I'm sure it plays better with more players, but i cannot recommend this at 2 players.

For now i'll stick with Acquire at lower player counts.

You can keep your 18xx and other multi-hour borefests, this is my type of stockgame! Further streamlines previous incarnation Union Pacific and the theme is airlines again, which is cool because there are about 5 million traingames already. I wish there were expansion maps, but I guess it wasn't popular enough. Components are really good and the rules are accessible for almost any level of players. Great game!

Union Pacific with planes.  That's what this game is, no questions asked.  Is it a good thing?  Sure since Union Pacific is somewhat difficult to find these days.  So airline Europe is a good majority game that has a place on the shelves of any serious gamer.

Decent share collecting family game, playable with 7 year olds effortlessly, but it isn't that intense than I hoped to be. Probably three players are too few, but the decisions fairly easy to make, and the agendas of the other players are almost always obvious. The only excitement comes from the timing, as in when to place stock from hands to gain majority in time, before the random  scoring rounds occur. Pleasant, casual game, fine for an hour if there's no time for something more complex.

Really great majority ownership game.  Definitely a nice "next step" from Ticket to Ride -- slightly heavier in strategy, but similar in feel.  The simple turn options make for some careful planning and compelling decisions without feeling too overwhelming.  My only real complaint is that I wish it played about 25% shorter -- each game has felt like it has just slightly overstayed its welcome, but it's still good enough to be quickly forgiven.

RATING: 8
Game in a Nutshell: Build up airline companies, own stock in them, gain victory points when payout time comes around.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: Pretty simple game in that border-line "introductory" category. Has a satisfaction to building up your portfolio which allows for some different strategies along the way. Then comes the predicament of which companies to grow and who might be riding your coat-tails with stock of their own. It just boils down to having an intertwined mix of things going on that doesn't always seem apparent at first. How they boiled that down to such a simple rule-set is great... I dig the old-stylie art too.

Cons: There's some luck of the draw to what cards you'll have available for your portfolio. Since this is essentially the basis for your score, sometimes the game can come across frustratingly random. Since the game has so many different colored pieces and cards, it's inevitable that there will be some confusion on what's what (red/orange and white/grey seem the main culprits).

Other: It's my hope with more play that I'll find the luck of the draw will balance throughout most games. I think I like the game with 3,4 and 5 players equally.

Best Use: An introductory game with just enough extra meat to satisfy those who want a little more.

Without reservation, I highly recommend Airlines Europe. I find it to be a nice step up from Ticket to Ride  and a trickier challenge. Although not as accessible a gateway game as TTR, the balance of choices are just enough for me.  The speed of the gameplay is great and the minimal downtime even with 5 players is a real benefit. It is a lovely game to look at and very colorful once more and more of those lovely planes get onto the map. Its not a cutthroat game but there is just enough opportunity to mess with other players’ plans to keep things interesting. When you get behind, there will be opportunities to improve your position  and its hard to tell for sure how things will end up so it all keeps you on your toes. Most of all, Airlines Europe is just plain fun. Its not a thematic experience but the level of theme is fine for the type of game it is. I recommend that you introduce your non-gamer friends to Ticket to Ride first and if they enjoy that, they should be able to transition into Airlines Europe and really enjoy it.  Definitely one of the better games I’ve played.

Nice game.  Really smooth mechanics. I like the ability to benefit from the work of others, and the choices can be pretty tough, especially as Abacus stock value goes up in later rounds.  The games have all been close so far, which is a tribute to well tested play balance. Biggest drawback at this point is that it is really difficult to tell if you are winning or not- because the games seem to always run close, the times I have won I have been genuinely surprised that I did.  The lack of "how am I doing?" feedback is a real issue for this.  Decisions are more intense if you know if you are risking the win or not.

I appreciate the attempt to make a game where the players don't really own anything but all benefit from each others' actions. In Airlines Europe, all shareholders benefit if you expand a route, so you need to make sure that you benefit the most. However, the random availability of shares and two turn mechanism to get them into your portfolio give you less control. I would also have preferred more tension, such as a more crowded board. Still, a simple and fast game.

Excellent game if you are playing with four people. Three people would be alright. This game does not scale well at all. The board is just too open when reduce players.

Considered getting since I heard it was like TTR but better by some people. But I also think it'd be too light for me. Or maybe not? I'm not sure. Would like to try sometime. I also think that 2.4 game weight is a bit high for a gateway honestly. Its just like how Lords of Waterdeep/Catan/Dominion haven't always worked that well for me as gateways.

Recently, Ive found that using a combination of party and filler games together can work as a decent gateway, then continuing on from my lowest weighted games.

My favorite Alan Moon game.  Improves upon Union Pacific by replacing the track cards with money and by using a more generous scoring system which takes some of the sting out of having a dividend card appear right before your turn.

I think I like Airlines Europe. Despite its numbers oriented theme, the game's play is very simple. Probably too simplistic for some gamers, but it succeeds in taking stockholding and reducing much of the math that is usually involved with that mechanic.

The player actions in the game are pretty detached from the reality of any stock markets I've ever heard of, but they do allow for smooth flowing play with little down-time and possibility of analysis paralysis.

Airlines Europe's components tread the line between nice and rubbish. The board has a nice layout, but a dull color scheme. The shares are graphically nice, but the airlines have names that no one would ever fly with. The miniature airplanes are well-modeled, but the airport and scoring pawns are the flimsiest. The victory point chits are useless; players should record their scores individually on private notepads instead. Oh, and the box cover is brightly colored, but dominated by the image of a stewardess who looks stoned as hell.

RATING: 10
Well, I'm kind of biased but even after so many games of Airlines Europe I still wouldn't turn down a game. It's the right amount of luck mixed with tense, tactical gameplay and easily playable in like one hour. In my opinion, the shortened playtime, the new share track system, the 'exclusion' of the track cards and the great atmosphere created by Christian Fiore's graphics and the bits make it superior to its predecessors.

RATING: 6.5
Engaging enough in the playing, but, like my beeves with Chicago Express/El Grande/etc, it boils down to a king-making/under-the-radar dynamic, typical of what happens when area majorities determine victory points. I.e., the person who manages to evade the notice of his opponents, or who is targeted least by his opponents/the losing player(s), is more likely than not to emerge the winner.

A solid stock-development game with an interesting mechanism for advancing the stock (airplane routes that can be strategically blocked), It's a great little game that has a great deal of replayability, and it's easy enough for bringing it to family outings and such.

2017 UPDATE: Gifted my copy to a friend who fell in love with the game.  It's a perfect game for folks who want the next step up from gateway games.  Highly recommended.

Stock market game that should play in 90 minutes. I have not managed to do so, and my game felt lenghty and that hurt the tension. I think we played too slow, there was too much thinking. Also, maybe 5 players is too much.

I have played Union Pacific, very similar, and the experience was better in that regard. Nonetheless, according to the rules, AE should play even faster.

The theme doesn't work, but the plastic plains look cool :P

Nuova variante, sempre di Alan R. Moon, sul filone Ticket to Ride. Airlines Europe è molto simile ai sui predecessori ferroviari, stessa ambientazione, disegni e meccaniche di piazzamento. La principale differenza sta nel fatto che questo prodotto è un azionario (si rifà al vecchio Union Pacific) dove ogni giocatore dovrà cercare di avere il controllo o comunque una buona fetta azionaria delle compagnie (10) che si spartiscono i cieli d'Europa. Rispetto al già citato Union Pacific le differenze più sostanziali sono nel tabellone, migliorato per grafica e chiarezza; via le poco chiare tratte ferroviarie differenti, aggiunto un nuovo bordo tabellone segnapunti e infine il passaggio dal Nord America all'Europa. In sintesi un gioco semplice, veloce e simpatico. Dà il meglio giocato in 5 giocatori.

Possibly THE ideal stock-holding game for middleweight gamers. Less valuation than German Railways or 18xx, and less analysis than Acquire. And don't get me wrong - these are all fine games. The biggest gripe is the horrible accounting systems (paper money AND VP tokens in insufficient amounts? Yuk!).

Is it dumbed down? Maybe, but it's several steps up on the same designer's Ticket To Ride, and it plays comfortably in 90 minutes. I'll bite.

It is like Ticket to Ride with a stock mechanic.  When playing with newer gamers it usually takes until the first scoring round for them to get it.

It's not as elegant as Union Pacific or even Airlines, but it's a good game in its own right.  I would rather play Union Pacific.  There are more actions to choose from each turn and it doesn't feel as tense as its predecessors.  I like how victory points can be scored for 3rd, 4th, even 5th place for each company.  But I'm divided about the implementation of money in this game.  This one feels more cooperative... not sure how I feel about that either.  Still, I enjoy the core Airlines/Union Pacific mechanics, and I wouldn't turn down a game of Airlines Europe.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]I definitely enjoyed my plays of Airlines and would happily play it again. I ended up trading it away because our shelves got crowded and AE just didn't get to the table. Now that I'll have more gaming space I would happily get this game again, but I've also recently played the Pennsylvania map for TTR and while a lighter stock market game it was one I could see playing with my extended family.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Another excellent family weight game [i](probably a step up from TTR)[/i], but still very easy to teach to new gamers.
- Beautiful production quality and components, the board looks great as you fill it up with the airplanes.
- Each turn you can take 1 of 4 possible actions [i](simple right?)[/i], but that decision is never easy since the scoring cards always seem to come up one round too soon.
- I really appreciate the hidden scoring combined with the variable round ends create a very tense game where every decision is extremely important.[/i]

Take the base Union Pacific game and add a layer of rule chrome to it to glossy it up, matching the glossing up of the components to snazzy looking aircraft. Problem is, the addition of the money aspect doesn't materially enhance the gameplay and slows down the game a little. Instead of just placing a train/plane to pick up a share, you pay money to place it. Instead of the train/plane's value going up by a standard 1 VP, it now goes up by the money you paid, where each jump to the next VP-earning band gets gradually bigger. When you place shares, you get money back. If that's not enough money, you can pass to get more money. So, no change in gameplay, just more fiddly. It adds an extra dimension of managing money flow and the strategic element of do I pay for more planes each turn to get bigger VP jumps but only get 1 share and spend some turns not getting anything, or do I pay less each turn so the VP value goes up slower but I get more shares because I get to play on more turns. So that's the variation if you're looking for something a bit more substantial than the base game. It's still an easy and enjoyable romp, even if it has the same upside-down issue of getting more and more incremental as the game gets on rather than less and less.

The game is pretty good, but I just didn't like it much. I went in with fairly low expectations, and they were met. I really like economic games, but really dislike games with shared components and bluffing. I like it better than my memories of Acquire from many years ago.

I found the severe limitations on drawing cards to be frustrating.

Weight of 2.4 is probably a bit high. I would give it a 2.2 or 2.3.

Have been enjoying Airlines a lot the past few months.  I've found it a good "next level" game to teach new gamers who started with Ticket to Ride.  It is just similar enough to be easy to teach, but with more depth and strategy.  I like the bluffing aspect and the tension which comes from the choice whether or not to "buy" stock and reveal your intentions, or hold the cards to conceal them, risking that a scoring round might occur before you get them down.

11/28/11 - What grabbed me the most about the game was investing in the various airlines. You never knew if you were helping someone else or securing the points for yourself. The randomness of available stocks deters from too much strategy and can keep you from attaining rare stocks. I wouldn't own Airlines but I would play if asked and the game board looks great when finishing the game.

There's not really much strategy in this game. Most of the game you just end up taking random cards, because nobody wants to take the cards from the table. Play Union Pacific instead.

RATING: 7
 I like the fast but tense turns.  You have a list of 4 options on each turn and at least two of them are good, but of course you can only choose one.  There is some randomness/luck of the card "stock share" draw, but I enjoy some luck in a game as long as its not overpowering. I really like the scoring system in this game and how building an airline route improves the stock value of that company and hence benefits everyone holding that stock. This adds a layer of strategy in that you have to decide when is the best time to put your "stocks" into play. It works well as a 2 player game, but I do have games that work better as a 2 player.  Using poker chips for money will improve the enjoyment of the game (for me anyway), but otherwise the production is top notch.  Will gladly play this one anytime.

WARNING:  The scoring of each company becomes overly tedious when the scoring cards comes up. Use paper and pencil with hash marks to award points THEN pass out VP chips after you have totaled each player to speed it up.  Or just don't even bother passing out the chips.


UPDATE:  I knocked it down from a 9 to an 8 because of a balance issue at the 3 player count.  If one player grabs an Air Abacus stock, that player has a HUGE advantage if it is uncontested (minimum 16 points for a single card, but as many as 28).  Hence another player must contest him for it.  That leaves player 3 who just stays out of it at an advantage.  Somehow, at the 3 player count, the power of Air Abacus needs to be adjusted.  Perhaps using a dummy hand similar to the 2 player variant for Air Abacus only might help.

UPDATE: One other knock n the game is that with less than four players, the board is just not tight enough.

This game is a descendant of Union Pacific, and feels like a watered-down version of that great game.  In Union Pacific, players constantly agonized over whether to place track or play stock.  Here, however, money is added to the game, meaning that on some turns you cannot place track; you must either play stock or skip your turn to get money for later.  In that way, it felt a little as if the game was playing you instead of the other way around.  The board also feels more open than in Union Pacific, taking some of the tension out of the game.  I'm still giving this game a decent rating because I enjoy the system, but I'd choose to play Union Pacific over this every time.

Fun game, very similar to Union Pacific, on which it was based by the same designer.  Build airline routes, buy stock in the largest and most successful companies, then when each of the 3 scoring cards are drawn, score to see if you have the best investments.  Rules can seem complicated, but once you play 30 minutes or so and draw a scoring card and do the scoring then it all makes sense.  Looking forward to playing again.

2/1/12 - This is an interesting game. It's not really my thing but I think it will grow on me. Sometimes games run way too long though and I'm happy to see those scoring cards. I played a 5 player game and it seems that we used up almost all the routes and planes. The board was super crowded and was very limited on routes. I still plan to bring this out during family game night to see how everyone likes it. Paper money sucks.

7/15/12 - Well, my family loved it and requested to play again. It's their first introduction into Euro style gaming so it took them a little while to understand it but when they did they loved it. The game did grow on me and I think my favorite part is pushing your luck trying to get more stocks before the scoring card comes up. The board and routes are not very important. You can't really block anyone, and if you did it's not a big deal. The stock purchasing and managing are great but I just wish the route building was more competitive.

Good game with smart, streamlined mechanisms and gameplay - I enjoyed this more than other share-collecting games such as Acquire.

As I tend to like spatial, map-based games, I had hoped the network-building aspect would come into play more, but most of the game's focus seems to be on the airline value track and the share cards, and for much of the time the map is almost irrelevant.

I played this game at my local board game meetup. I love this game! After playing it at the meetup I ended up getting a copy for myself. I like how you have to watch out how much each player has invested into their share of stocks. I also love how you can piggy back ride onto someone else's airline if you are able to get the cards you need on your turn.

I can feel this game will play well with 3+ players and will be best at 4 to 5 players.

---- Update ----
I actually feel this game is best at 2-4 players. 5 players are taking too long for what this game offers.
I have affinity to math-y games so I think AE is right up my alley. 

The only down side is that I'd wish they don't use paper money for the currency but I can see it become a problem with repeated plays.

---- Update ----
With so many games better at 2-players this game is pretty much shelved. Rating drops from 8->7.

Ticket to ride meets Imperial. Literally - this describes the game perfectly. Unfortunately, it is about 20 minutes too long. Drawing a single share each time you buy 1 or 2 airplanes makes the game too slow and being forced to spend turns taking the "money action" makes it standstill. We are thinking of making a house rule to draw 2 cards when you buy 2 planes to speed the game up and help make it more exciting. It plateau's after the 1st scorecard and then feels a little winded by the time you finish. Other than that, a good game overall.

Rules read: Glad to see the value of the shares has been converted from the variable, painful counting of trains to fixed values on a scoring track; the values are small so hopefully scores will be tight. Only concern is that playing with four or less may cause uneven wear and tear on the stock cards, so only for 5 player sessions. However as a design feature I'm not a fan of Ordinal Rewards esp if more than first and second because of the cross referencing (especially peripherally) to determine placing not only interrupts game play but isn't an exciting chore. So far the best type of Ordinal Rewards is only for Most which has been done better by Tribune and Rheinlander which is done there and then.

RATING: 4
This is a quick playing stock game where players invest in, and build out airline companies. As the airline gets more board presence, the stock becomes worth more points. When a scoring card flips, players get points for each stock they hold based on it's valuation position and based on their majority standing with that company. The actions are fueled by money and the flip luck of what stock cards you manage to draw. In terms of feel, this game is similar to Paris Connection and Chicago Express, but this game feels lacking in comparison, because the board is so open, and building in one direction vs another is fairly meaningless.

This is a great game with a lot of nuance in bluffing possible. The downside is I wish the stock system was less abstract. You don't really feel like you're buying stock... you just happen to "get" stock.

If you got a stock matching the airline you expanded, that'd make a lot more sense. Or if you could buy and sell somehow, that'd also help.

That said, the game is great, so I'm willing to overlook that.

I was really excited by the first reports of Airlines Europe because it sounded like it fixed all my problems with Union Pacific (which I played once a while back). Those were the cumbersome track card system, the almost completely random timing of dividends and the over-ease of acquiring Union Pacific shares. Well, it does fix those things, but unfortunately it introduces problems of its own that killed my desire to buy it. For one, the setup is too fiddly for a game of this length and weight. For another, the board just doesn’t matter enough - it’s way too hard to block routes so each company can usually do exactly what it wants. And finally, the way the scoring pays out VPs down to 4th place in shares gets rid of a lot of the tension of UP. In fact, it seems you get a better rate of return for just having one share in most companies rather than trying to fight for majorities.

Airlines Europe is a good gateway game. Similar (but not identical) in mechanics to its more famous cousin by the same game designer - Ticket to Ride - I think Airlines Europe has a more strategy element to it than TtR because a player is not representing any one airline company and trying to win by making that company the furthest along in terms of route coverage. Players are investors and to win requires wise investments in a portfolio of companies depending on cards drawn by a player as well as opponents. 

While I think TtR is still the more accessible gateway game between the two, Airlines Europe is not that much more difficult and would be a good step up game for TtR fans.

Successor and predecessor to Union Pacific. 
This is different enough to have a different gaming experience. 
Includes money management since you have to purchase the routes which increases the values of the lines. 
Have choices do you build faster 2 routes at once to increase value or get through a bottleneck at the cost of fewer stocks being retrieved. or spend turns to collect money.
It seems to encourage diversification since you can acquire some money by playing stock and the dividend rules are more friendly (round up). Also the VP payout allows for more positions in the line.
An enjoyable game? Yes. Do I enjoy it more than UP? probably not.

I was expecting a game with more strategic and tactical depth than Union Pacific. I think that UP is a better game because it's much less fiddly than Airlines Europe.

In UP, there's only VP (which is represented by money). Airlines Europe adds another ultimately uninteresting layer of money in addition to VP; you need money to lay down routes. You get more money by laying down tracks, or by "missing" a turn and getting money.

As with UP, the most interesting conflict is whether to lay down shares or get shares. In both cases, the board play adds more fiddliness than strategic depth or interest.

This is a 30-45 minute game with an identity crisis.

Edit: Downgraded 2 points because this is entirely superseded by Chicago Express. If you want a game where you build routes, manipulate stocks, and form temporary alliances due to external incentives, play Chicago Express. You'll get a deeper experience in a shorter time for less money.

Similar to, yet different from, its predecessor Union Pacific. Extending a line is less stressful; there are no limits on which routes you can occupy, other than your ability to pay and the limited number of slots per route. OTOH it is harder to get Abacus Airlines shares than it is to get Union Pacific shares. AE feels a bit less complex than UP, but also a bit less random because of the lack of rail cards. I think I prefer UP but at the moment I'm not sure why. Regardless, AE is a fine game, and I'd play again at the drop of a hat.

This is basically Ticket to Ride, but with 2 fundamental differences.  1) You don't own any one color.  You can claim routes for all the airlines (thus making them more profitable).  2) Also, you don't need to collect a set of cards to claim a route.  It is all money based.

The basic idea of the game is to get $ by collecting stocks...then use that money to make the airlines you have invested in more profitable by buying routes for those airlines.

It adds one dimension from TTR.  My 19 year old daughter annouced:  "This is my new favorite game" after our first play....of course she was the one who had won the game.

The gamer's version of Ticket to Ride. Airlines Europe is awesome. I love the idea of buying stock in the airlines rather than actually owning any one airline. You could actually benefit from another player's strategy, just by buying stock. It's a great game, easy to play, and tons of fun.

Building routes to raise the share prices on airlines whose shares you own.  I really like the balance between building routes, gaining shares, revealing shares so that you try to get others to help build routes while also trying to get a majority holding for the scoring phases.  Captures good elements from Ticket to Ride, Alhambra and market trading games.  There's player interaction and interesting choices, it's true to its theme and it moves along at a good pace.

RATING: 6
My first two games of this were two-player so your mileage may vary. It looks like a route connection game in the same vein as Moon's Ticket to Ride series. Its not. This is a majority control set collection game, more like the ouvre of Reiner Knizia. Three times in the game everyone scores based on where they position (1st to whatever) in terms of the number of shares they hold for each company. When players acquire shares they also increase the share value of one of the companies so its all about judging just how much you need and which company is going to be the big scorer.
At points the rules are a little fiddly and the basic objectives are disguised (the routes you establish on the board are actually quite abstract) so this isn't quite a gate-way game, but its not a complex game either. Over-all it is a good game though I wasn't wowed by it, I think because I've played quite a few simpler games which do the same thing.

The addition of money (buying routes, gaining dividends) makes for a tighter game compared to Union Pacific.  And the Air Abacus (UP) shares while still powerful don't feel as overwhelmingly so as in UP - most likely because they are a bit more costly to acquire.  Limited things to do each turn and trying to manage tempo make this game feel more streamlined in a good way compared to UP.

If you like Ticket to Ride but wish it had more strategy, Airlines Europe should be next on your list.  Instead of owning a single color on the board everyone can build on any color and then via for control of that company through stock purchases.  Victory points are determined based on your Ownership level in the company which can shift from round to round.

A very solid evolution of Union Pacific.  The tempo decisions are fantastic, and the game has lots of emergent dilemmas without a lot of rules.

You have to get use to the fact that, while game is fast, the pace can feel slow -- there are no sudden turns of events, but rather gradual setup and positioning.

With only 3 players, the board it too open.  Using the expansion or just seeding the board with the unused airlines helps a lot, so that the topology is an interesting restriction instead of an irrelevant detail.

The next step up from Ticket to Ride (not really similar in mechanics, more in theme and look) - it's more like El Grande - competing for area control through set collection and increasing the "areas" worth the most points by purchasing planes. The randomness of what color card comes up (revealed from the top of deck after a player takes one of the face up card) can have a big impact on the game if a crucial card comes up at the right time, as every card draw counts much more so than TtR (thus making it often much better tactically for you to draw from the deck and not give a chance to the next player(s) of seeing the key color card they need).

--Dec2011-- Pleasant set collection game.  Not quite as compelling as I might have hoped: the random onset of the mid-game scorings was a rather huge factor in the outcome, but other than that, there wasn't much tension.  (Union Pacific was on my wishlist - but this one, even though I'd be happy to play again, won't be.)  It's possible, of course, that 3 isn't the ideal count; I'm happy to re-evaluate things after playing with more.

I've heard others refer to AE as a "streamlining" of Union Pacific, but as I understand that word, this isn't that. It instead makes that game a little looser, a bit easier to do what you want. I liked it a tick less than UP because of this, and would prefer the latter if I were to play one of the two.

I'm reminded why I'm not a big fan of Union Pacific, and despite a the big improvement in the track laying department, the fiddly points cash and unpredictable (near random) sudden scoring still irks me.

It's a nice enough family game where the points will be close, but the winner will often be left up to the scoring card draw and as such it's less appealing to gamers not in a family setting.

I've seen this game's components and if I ever own a copy I'll be drawing a yellow stripe down the back of all the orange planes. It can be confusing comprehending the orange and red planes when they're near each other.

Airlines Europe is a great gateway to shareholding games, and an overall good choice for large game groups if the official 6P variant is used. The shareholding system requires players to collaborate in raising the values of companies, all while remaining cautious of partners who leech off their efforts. The phantom Air Abacus shares also add some depth to share management, as they require players to discard existing shares to obtain them.

Barring known component issues – which include similar plane colours and a lack of VP chips in small denominations – I don't have many complaints about this design. The more serious gamers may find the shareholding system relatively shallow and luck-based, but it still offers challenging decisions befitting the game's light-to-middleweight nature. The only nitpick is that there is a potential of the game stagnating if players collectively focus on playing shares down, although this rarely happens with larger groups.

Best described as a blending of "Ticket to Ride" with a  stock/share game...and yes, it actually makes it more of a fun experience. A solid light-medium weight game with more strategic elements than the aforementioned train/route building game...and yes, it's way better than Ticket to Ride

This one did not do much for me, and I love games with stock purchasing. I can't really place my finger on it, and it is entirely possible it was just the experience I had learning the game (there was a player that REALLY dragged things down), but this is not one I feel the need to look into any further. The game works just fine. It just did not have that wow factor.

Örültem, hogy nem sokkal az elődje, az Union Pacific után ki tudtam próbálni a játékot. És meglepő módon kicsit csalódást okozott. A játék ugyan szép, de a piros és narancssárga repülők megkülönböztetése még tökéletes szemmel sem könnyű. A játék nehezebb, mint az UP érdekes módon. Ott a síneket egyszerű akcióval lehetett szerezni és összesen volt két választási lehetőség az akciók terén. Itt négy is van, ugyanis bevezették a pénzt. Az útvonalak lehelyezése ugyanis pénzbe kerül, amit viszont részvénykibocsátással lehet szerezni, vagy a negyedik akcióval, ami egyszerű pénzfelvétel. A játékosok itt vasúttársaságok helyett repülőtársaságokban szereznek tulajdoni részvényeket. A tábla szebb, de a sok kis apró színes repülő nehezebben átlátható, mint az UP nagyobb tábláján a vonatok sokasága. Egyedül a társaságok nagyságát jelentő sáv és egyértelmű pontozásuk megjelenítése tetszett. Ez kimaradt anno az UP-ből és ott mindig számolni kellett értékelésekkor. Az értékelések feljövetelének megoldása is jobbnak tűnik itt, mert jobban elosztódnak az értékelőlapok, de ez engem az UP-ben nem zavart, hogy teljesen véletlen is lehetett. Szóval a játék nehézsége és átláthatatlanabbsága kicsit csalódást okozott így egy ponttal kevesebbet adok rá, mint az UP-re, ettől függetlenül mindenkinek ajánlom, mert egyrészt valakinek biztos ez jön be majd jobban, másrészt pedig egy jó kis játékról van szó, amiben amúgy elég nagy a szerencse, szerintem nagyobb is, mint pl. a Ticket to Ride-ban.

I've heard the TTR comparisons, but really? This is not a "step up" from TTR. It's stock game that's easy to wrap your head around after half a play. It's not as easy or clean as Acquire, but it seems to make at least a tiny bit more in a thematic sense than Alhambra.

Could have been a great game, but too forgiving. The board isn't as tight as I'd like. There's not much room for cutthroat play, so there's little reason to build any particular route. And the payout structure doesn't do enough to encourage players to acquire and maintain controlling interests, so strategy is obvious. There's zero excitement. While the inspiration is obvious, this game is the opposite of everything I love about Acquire. Also, the game badly needs a scoring track. On all counts, it's hard not to be disappointed by what might have been. Play Acquire instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Extremely fun, interesting, and fast-playing game. It has everything I love about Acquire and more. Haven't played the original Airlines or Union Pacific, but this is a very solid title that I won't hesitate to play, given the opportunity.

I like it, although I'm not sure that I like it better than its predecessor. There is a lot of good stuff here:
- the great use of the score track for indicating the VP rewards with scoring ... simply brilliant!
- the MUCH less random way that scoring rounds occur ... that's probably the thing I liked least (hated most?) about UP!
- the way you get Air Abacus shares, taking your entire turn and allowing you to get 2 at once (you couldn't do that in UP, could you?) I do, however, kinda miss the track cards -- a like a bit of hand management! Also, the trains were cooler than planes (why? I didn't think I was a train person!)!

Of course, I'm still not very good at the game, but I do look forward to playing it more! It feels somewhat light, and a bit shorter than I generally prefer. I suspect, though, that there's more depth here than you see at first glance. 

--- Summary ---
The map shows cities in Europe connected to each other by plane routes, each with 1-3 spaces (with increasing prices each) to place company ownership markers (plastic planes, each company with a different number in Supply). There are also a few foreign connections -- from a European city to an off-board space, and with a higher route cost. The starting cities for each company (named after designers, companies, etc -- eg Jolly Roger Airships) are marked, and bonus tiles are placed for 4 airlines (the smallest companies, i.e. the ones with the fewest planes in Supply).
- A marker is placed on the scoring track for each company, in specific places per company.
- If playing with fewer than 5 people, remove one or more company planes and share cards from the game (specified in rules) and $30 per missing player from the bank.
- Players start with $8, a random hand of 8 share cards; each simultaneously chooses 2 shares to place into their display.
- 5 Share cards are placed on display (like Ticket to Ride).
- The rest of the cards, except for the Air Abacus shares (which are placed to the side) are shuffled with the 3rd Scoring Card shuffled into the bottom 10, the first Scoring Card placed beneath a quarter or so of the remaining cards, and the second Scoring Card placed in the middle(ish) of the remaining share cards.

On your turn, you can take ONE of the following actions:
- take $8 from bank: If there's not enough in the bank, every player with more than $8 must return the excess; then remove shares in the draw area (stock market) from the game, replacing with 5 new shares.
- claim a route or two: if a company has plane(s) available in Supply, choose an available route (one connected to either the airline's starting city or a city in that airline's network), pay the bank the lowest cost shown on that route, and place that company's plane on that spot. Advance the company's marker on the score track according to route cost. If one of the small companies is now connected (for the first time) to its target city, remove that target token from the board and add its value to the company's position on the score track. You may do this twice. Then, draw a single share from the face up display or the draw deck; display is immediately replenished to 5 face-up. If scoring card comes up, give it to the next player and draw a replacement card.
- play shares: place 1+ shares from a single company, OR 1 share in each or 2 companies, from your hand into your display. Receive $2 per share played; again, if bank runs out of money resolve as above.
- take Air Abacus share: exchange shares in hand, discarding to the face-down discard deck, for Air Abacus; either 2-for-1 or 3-for-2

Resolving the Scoring Card: 
- for each company, rank the shareholders according to the number of shares in their display. Players earn VP chits according to chart indicated in various sections of the score track. For ties, average the affected ranks (always rounding up).
- Also pay VP for Air Abacus according to the chart printed on the board (payments increase with each scoring round).
- Starting with the person holding the Scoring Card, players take ONE of the shares in the face up stock market (do not replenish display when card taken). Then, remove any remaining shares from the game and draw 5 new replacements.

The game ends after the third scoring round. It could end earlier (rare) if all airlines are blocked (in which case a final scoring round occurs immediately, then the game ends). The player with the most VP wins!

RATING: 5
This game felt very much like Alan R. Moon's big hit, Ticket to Ride, but not as good.  In this game we are still collecting different colored tickets but instead of "spending" these tickets to build tracks on a map these tickets represent our stock in different colored airlines.  We can build airlines by spending a certain amount of money to build destinations on a map and the more destinations an airline reaches the more valuable that airline's stock.  So the gameplay is as simple as buying up stock and bumping up your stock's value.

There's not much more to it and that's why I feel this game isn't as good.  It's fun enough but it does feel very similar to Ticket to Ride and I'd much rather play that.  This game also, much more so than Ticket to Ride, has a huge luck-of-the-draw problem.  Rarer tickets aren't any more difficult to acquire than the more common ones and rarer tickets both start the game more valuable and are easier to obtain majority shareholder of.  So flipping over a rarer ticket for your turn or getting one luckily off the top of the face-down deck gives you an advantage just for being lucky.

And on the flip side there, to me, seems to be a lot less strategy in this game than ticket to ride.  Since the rummy-like mechanic of collecting colored tickets to build lines no longer exists players can build anywhere on the map and except for a couple special areas building one destination is pretty much just as beneficial as any other.  So there's no longer any opportunity to block your opponent or throw him off his path.

I'd also like to point out that this game is the worst nightmare of a color-blind gamer.

Yet another remake of Airlines. I actually prefer Union Pacific, despite the track cards and the awkward rules for UP shares (use the tournament rules instead).

Airlines Europe is a lot smoother and may even be too smooth. Because of the bonus tiles, payouts are almost the same for every airlone and since every shareholder gets some dividends, competition is a lot less tight.

Probably OK as a family game, but give me UP any day.

This has become a fast favorite for me, Its easy to teach has depth without complexity and is hard to develop an unbeatable strategy making it enjoyable to play with new players as the likelihood of one person always winning is unlikely.

Since it has little plastic pieces, cards that match them, relatively light gameplay, and the same designer as Ticket to Ride, it is easy to compare this with TTR.  And I much prefer this one.  This is its "kinder, gentler" cousin.  Not as much blocking,  not as tight, and actually some working together.  I get kinda tense playing TTR (I hate when my route gets stolen), and with my very competitive nature, this is a more pleasant experience for everyone concerned. 

I really enjoy this game and have had great success introducing this gem to many people.

It takes a scoring or two to realize what you're doing but the game flows really well.
I like how you try to convince people to invest in a particular airline while trying to claim control of it.
You always want to do the 4 actions possible but have to settle for just 1.
Lots of manipulation for little gain ; the scoring phases are a chore.

With "Airlines Europe", Alan R. Moon continues to not thrill me with another mildly interesting game.  (Even the physical components are fairly bland, with the exception of those wonderful plastic aircraft - although even with those, the red and orange colours can be difficult to tell apart under anything but the most ideal lighting conditions).  It's not that the game is poorly designed; in fact, it's a nice, tight, user-friendly approach to the "network building and shares" genre that provides a good, competitive game experience with beautifully minimal rules.  I think that my main problem with the game is that the choice of aircraft placement on the board feels largely meaningless for much of the game, with the exception of the few colours that receive the bonuses for connecting specific cities.  I'd really like to see more interesting board play somehow integrated into the experience.  So while it's light and interactive and fairly fun, it has not ended my long search for a "shares" game of this genre that hits my own "sweet spot" ratio of simplicity of rules to interesting decisions.  Game design: 3.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 6.5/10

Первая партия оставила смешанные чувства: с одной стороны игра действительно заставляет думать на несколько шагов вперед, пытаться просчитать наиболее эффективную комбинацию по получению и разыгрыванию акций. Однако отсутствие бонусных маршрутов у большинства компаний делает их развитие несколько хаотичным, а игра с VP в закрытую приводит к непониманию того, кто же выигрывает - а значит лишает возможности играть против конкретного игрока.

HI recently upgraded this game from a 6 to 7.5. 

Initially none of my family liked the small airlines bonus which made acquisition of small company shares to be a no-brainer. Moreover, contol is more likely to be acquired by luck of the draw compared to larger Airlines. 

However, playing with the 'Power Grid' blocking variant has breathed new life into this game. It's now genuinely possible to block or at least delay, a small company from automatically achieving its bonus. 

This offers far more possibilities. Consequently, it's getting a lot of table time recently.

Like eating the blandest, wobbliest raw tofu.

Disappointing. Too many companies, too many shares, too many planes and most importantly too many routes which results in a rather loose and dull experience. I can see why it may appeal to families for just these reasons but for gamers this is not worth playing.

For alternatives, SNCF (Paris Connection) and Wabash Cannonball (Chicago Express) are better, faster and no more difficult to explain than this. They're also less fiddly and don't outstay their welcome. Or Acquire and TtR. They both excel at what they do.  

The only saving grace this game has is production values, especially those cute little aeroplanes which are totally cool.

Economic game, trying to increase your number of shares portfolio and trying to get into best portfolio position before the scoring card being drawed, while the board and component resembles TTR... its not quite like TTR but there's some element of network building in it, kinda have mixed feeling abt this game, its kinda gateway which is ok for me, but the board feels kinda too messy for newbie to understand. also at some point u have to rely on luck to get the specific shares that you want, I think i will try this some more games.

After trying the game more... i cant really like the game, is just a game of majority and the board just like irrelevant and almost no interaction or blocking happened, the theme also doesnt make sense... im going to let this one go.

I'm sure with another play or two this game will go to a 10. It's that good, but I usually don't rate games a 10 on the first play very often.

This is a game that is more similar to Alhambra than Ticket to Ride, but it has a lot more depth and strategy to it. Plus there's a lot more interaction. You can go from competing with someone to helping them out in the next couple minutes. 

But even with the amount of depth in the game, it's not too complicated. I think it's the perfect game to introduce to people right after you've taught them a gateway game.

The only drawback I see to the game is that it can drag on a little longer than this type of game should.

An odd re-engineering of Ticket to Ride that adds shares (which really aren't shares at all, just a majority set collection game) with some gentle hand management and cash flow management.

It feels like it needs more competition for spaces on the routes and a slightly more involved shareholding.

It's certainly more fun than TtR, but nothing I'm desperate to play again. A fun game that could work as a gateway, but isn't anything spectacular.

Update: Jesus, this is downtimey with 5. Also, the card draw for shares then becomes really chaotic.

Rating down from 6.7 to 6.

Extremely pleasant game. This feels very similar to Acquire. In my mind, I place it somewhere in between Acquire and Chicago Express in terms of complexity. That said, I'm not sure the strategy is any more in depth than Acquire. I will say that the Air Abacus stock race adds a needed dose of tension. The fact that you can turn in cards in your hand or on the table is a wonderful design choice. I enjoy Airlines Europe quite a bit, and will gladly play any time someone is in the mood for a stock investment game.

Airlines Europe is certainly a good investment game, though it needs at least three players to truly shine IMO. With two, you're doing most of the heavy lifting yourself for the airlines you want to be successful.

Union Pacific in the air. The major routes for the minor airlines are a nice addition, and the whole thing seems just a little better thought out. You can still be caught out by the random element, but less so here than in Union Pacific.

RATING: 5
It's hard to find a more approachable stock game than Airlines Europe.  The side game of building out the map is non-confrontational.  Ties are friendly and only the top three owners score.  Turns are very quick, although the actions become repetitive once a strategy has been selected.  It's a lot of rules, cards, and pieces for a fairly vanilla experience that may not be meaty enough for veteran gamers.

Liked it the first time I played it but the paper money was very unpleasant to work with. Will try it with poker chips next time.

Update: Poker chips improved the experience greatly. Very good game. It involves a simple stock market where players with the most cards of a color get more points during the scoring phases. For a stock market-type game, this works extremely well with just two players.

Unfortunately the game is not very colorblind-friendly and even the non-colorblind have some trouble distinguishing between the orange and red that are used in this game.

Good, solid game.  My only negative opinion is that because you don't "own" any airlines, the routes you build are kind of weird and arbitrary based on how many spaces you want to advance the share marker, rather than more logical as it might be if you were actually building a business.

Not a bad game, but my single play makes me thinks the dominant strategy includes broadly diversifying your investments. If that's correct, then I find that kinda boring.

I have played three times now and I do like the game, but I don't love it as much as I think I should.  

I think the balance between actions might be too good. For some reason my decisions in this game don't seem to matter.  There are a a range of choices and all of them seem to be relatively equal in almost any game state. I clearly need to play this more before I can truly make this claim.

Nice components and theme and it seems to scale well from 2-6 so that is a big plus.

Monkeys on the Moon is very similar, but I think it is superior to this.  There is just a little more going on, it plays in less time and the theme is more fun.



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 4
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1.5

RATING: 7
A stock game where the players have pieces of information in which to base their selections on. Number of cards, players invested, resource investment needed to return dividends, number of possible links, all aid in assisting the players on which choices to make. The route placement slowing down your network building and stock acquisition, but the stocks do not score until they are face up creates quite a bit of angst with the random scoring. It creates a constant press your luck with the deck, and brinksmanship with your opponents. 

A "play the player" game.  I like these.  Relegates Union Pacific to the bench, as I strongly prefer how Air Abacus is handled in comparison to Union Pacific.

A neat stock investing game.  My only quibble is that it feels like you can't get enough cards in the mid to late game.  And because of that the situation tends to solidify.

Excellent game that might almost replace Ticket to Ride for me. TtR was what got me started (as is the case for many I believe), but Airlines has such a different feel that I think speaks to me more. I think I'm the kind of person who loves this "I'm trying to help myself get points but I also will be helping everyone else, so how do I best use my turn?" type of mechanic. I think partially it's replacing Ticket to Ride though because we really overplayed the latter, and that's too bad. But alas, such is life!

Purchased without research, and it proved to be a mistake. I was looking forward to stock trading shenanigans, running profitable airline companies and competing for routes. You don't really buy stocks, you take them. You don't earn money, you take them. You never run anything, and there's not a whole lot of competition for routes. You take some stocks, looking for majorities and chancing on when they will be scored. You plop down some plane to get more stocks. Shallow stuff, and to me, borderline boring. Components are OK, though the box corners will rip fairly easily.

I wanted to get Union Pacific, but it's long out of print.

This re-themed and updated version sounds even better.  We don't have too many stock games and they usually are pretty complicated. This game is from the same designer as Ticket to Ride.  It is much easier to wrap my head around than a game like Masters of Venice for instance.

I like the game.  It's deeper then Ticket to Ride, but has some of the same appeal.  I think this will hit the table pretty often.  I wish orange and red were easier to tell apart.  I may have to make one to help differentiate them.

RATING: N/A
Stock market/route building game, where you build routes on the map, the more you pay, the higher the stock value for that airline goes. Points get handed out to whomever has the most shares, 2nd most, etc. The higher the stock value, the higher the points.

As with most games that rely on a "collective consciousness", I did poorly. I seemed to be the only player working to get certain colours higher, whereas 2 or 3 of the others were working on other colours. Some of this is my poor predictive skills, but luck was a factor too. I knew on the first turn that 2 other players wanted orange to go high, I literally never had an opportunity to buy a single orange share the entire game. With none in the market, I'd draw from the deck, and get something else. When one did appear in the market, it was on other player's turns, and they'd buy them before it got back to me.

A decent game, I wouldn't mind trying it again, especially with 2 players.

It's not really Union Pacific, which might disappoint the hardcore UP fans, but for me, that was what made it enjoyable.  This design removes the track deck (which proved to be a frustration more often than not), separated the money and the VPs (which added another choice to the turns), and made it harder for the players to pick up UP stock.  All that, combined with the lower player number (meaning that UP stock could potentially be divided evenly among all players in the game) made a game that's much more enjoyable for me to play.  I don't feel the need to own it, but it's not something that I will refuse to play, like I do with Union Pacific.

I've never played Union Pacific, so I don't know how faithful this re-imagining of the system is to that original game. Assuming they are functionally the same, I'm not sure why either game has such a great reputation. I found it to be incredibly slow in the early rounds and nothing that anyone did seemed to matter much. It's like the first half of the game is just setting up the board for the last couple turns, which are the only ones that seemed to carry some decision making of any weight.

It's a bit like Ticket to Ride, but backwards. You connect a bunch of routes and then draw a bunch of cards to try and score them. That's not exactly how it works, but it is the net result. Ticket To Ride is clearly derived from this system and I think it is better in every way. Gathering resources then using them to connect routes and achieve a predetermined goal just makes for a better game. By comparison, Airlines Europe feels like you are  connecting routes before gathering the resources, all for a goal that you are not aware of early in the game and that changes on you almost every turn. I suppose that is just a different flavor of player interaction, so maybe I've answered my own question as to why people like it. Still, I found too much of my session playing it to be directionless and boring. Maybe if this was a faster playing card-game I might have liked it more...

After playing a few times, I decided that while a good enough game, it wasn't worth keeping considering all of the other games I own. Nothing bad, just nothing great.

Basically a re-theme of Union Pacific with upgraded components and some extra rules, although it's 90% the same game. That's a compliment, by the way. I own both games for a reason.

Seems like a marriage of Acquire and Ticket to Ride.  On the fence with this one because I'm not sure it does either of those games well enough to replace them and have this in addition.

UPDATE: No longer on the fence. This game has more meat and we have outgrown Ticket to Ride (we will still keep it for gateway company). Nothing will replace our Acquire nights.

The same game mechanics as Chicago Express, but refined. There are more ways to buy stocks and invest in the different companies. Decent game, but the mechanic is not one of my favorite.

Initial rating - I have played Union Pacific quite a lot so I knew what I was getting in this game - I really like how it's been developed further and made smoother and more interesting with the way money is handled. Really solid family style game.

I messed up while setting up the scoring cards into the deck, but the game still would have gone by very quickly even if I had done it right.  We all had a lot of fun trying to out-think our opponents and had a very close game.

Even as an old school fan of Union Pacific, I have to admit that Airlines Europe is a cleaned up, and better version. I miss the theme and map, and 6 player capability of UP, but the money replacing the track cards is just so much better of a mechanic.

After the first play, i was a bit concerned. It seemed slow paced. We didnt really understand the importance of airplane placement. Also, we tended to invest in our own few airlines which kind of killed the excitement.
We played this one more time last night and it was just plain fun! We used a house-rule that restricted the placement of planes on the third (most expensive license) until after the second scoring round. This helped the map feel more tight. Also, our strategies were much different this time around. We were more secretive about our plans until later in the game when more cards starting hitting the table. I must mention that i removed the Red airline cards from the deck. This shortened the game length as well as encouraged more competition over the remaining airline companies.
I am glad to discover this little game. Good fun. Can be very competitive. Especially for the Air Abbucus cards!
Solid 9 for us.

Yes, there are improvements over the original version.  But the luck o' the draw still reigns supreme.  The stocks available on your turn are critical, and completely out of your control.

I won't be playing this again, and it isn't even due to the fact that the stock colors are a disaster.

This one is a step above ticket to ride for me, while there are some similarities to TTR in the quick turns with simple choices to make and a similar route building feel, the games scoring mechanic is what sets this game apart for me.
Its like a ttr game where you can do your own thing and piggyback off other players as well if you play shrewdly enough or even invest in the AA stock as a fallback option.
The diversification of scoring options is satisfying.
Still like ticket to ride a lot and will usually play it but if given the choice this is the game Id bring out.
 
                      ONLY NEGATIVES:
Wasn't a fan of the victory point chits nor the paper money, thankfully there are only 2 denominations :)

Kind of a mash-up of TTR and Chicago express. Mixes lighter elements of route-building with public stock mechanics. Interesting game, not too heavy and plays quickly once everyone has the actions down.

Let's get one thing straight: this is NOT "Ticket to Ride with a stock market," as some commenters have been saying. It is a stock market game dressed up to look like Ticket to Ride.

The stock market portion of the game is okay, though I feel there's too much of a luck factor in terms of when the evaluations come up.

But what really bothers me about this is that the map itself is completely irrelevant to gameplay. It serves only to make players think they're playing a connection game, whereas in fact, the only thing that matters is how much money you sink into a company, not where you put the planes... and the possible connections are so abundant that you're never at a lack for a place to put a plane in order to spend the amount you want.

I had only played this game once back in September of 2013 but was immediately impressed with it. At that point, I hadn't played many stock market games, and to be honest, they weren't really on my radar either. At that time, for whatever reason, I was also more in to games that were overly complex and/or heavy.

Moving on to today, and having been exposed to a broader range of game-weights and game-styles, I'm amazed that it's taken me so long to pick up this game.

The game take elements from Ticket to Ride (which shouldn't be a surprise given that it's from the same designer) and merges it with a similar feel to Acquire. While I was never that big of a fan of the former (too simplistic and not overly "fun") and think the latter was "ok", this melds those two games in to something that is quite engaging, yet very simplistic in design and rule-set.

Ticket to Ride is a game that has fallen flat with the majority of people that I've played it with. I think that where that game had some decent ideas, Airlines expands on that to create a more robust and interesting game. It's a baby-step up from a 'gateway' game I think and is something that I'm looking forward to playing again soon.

Purchased this to replace Union Pacific which had some gamey issues I didn't care for. This plays virtually the same with a few minor differences and fixes. 5 player as opposed to 6 but with my group that is not a problem.

I like the look of this game and the play is even better! The turn limitations work out very well to make people pay close attention to their cycle of expanding airlines vs expanding stock... and those scoring rounds come up quick once you get rolling!  AE is an excellent middle weight stock collection game that should be accessible to just about anyone.

I didn't really know what to expect, given this game's pedigree, but what we get is a fairly fast-paced share jockeying game, with a dash of route maneuvering, just to optimize your costs and opportunities.  It makes use of some its [thing=94]dad[/thing]'s notions, like the Union Pacific / Air Abacus shares that seem inconvenient and undesirable, but provide heavy payouts by game end.  ...and the mysterious end of the game.  I'm unfamiliar with its [thing=43]mom[/thing], but what's ultimately important is how [thing=90419]the offspring[/thing] stands on its own:  It does just fine!  A nice, solid share game, with the expected cautious boosting of the market values for companies in which you may lose the advantage.  There is the additional surprising factor that folks may choose to dispose of shares in order to buy into Air Abacus — but while the drop in shares can be sudden, it serves as a warning shot that an increase in the other cometh.

There are plenty of in-jokes / tips of the hat on the cards, which is a nice touch.  It can feel a little frustrating if you are trying to get particular shares, so you can get them into play, but if you roll (or should I say [i]fly[/i]?) with what you get, you should do fine.  Remember that your opponents face some of the same frustration.  The lower-cost hops available earlier in the game, as well as the tight money situation (and of course the interim scorings) help devalue hoarding for a late-game KA-POW, but it is still possible, and perhaps viable; however, I feel this is much better mitigated than in [thing=9209][/thing], in which the connection opportunities can be insufficient incentive to play early and often, rather than hoard and then strafe the board.

I've been told this is an introductory type of 18XX game.  If so, I probably need to learn to play some 18XX games because I really like this one quite a bit.  My rating is down at 7.5 simply because it's something I have to be in the right mood for, but I enjoy it when I break it out.

Played once and enjoyed it. It felt more like an area majority game rather than an economic game. Definitely more enjoyable than TTR. The way i played at first was different than the end. Went for quantity and cheaper routes whereas when i solidified control in some airlines i went for the 7s and 8s. I found the interaction on the board more limited than i expected. I only felt it on the share holdings.

Similar mechanics to Ticket to Ride, but very different gameplay experience. I've had a lot of fun with this. It is a very thematic money management and stocks game, even if the mechanics don't make a lot of sense. It's two biggest problems are:

1) Paper money.
2) The different colors of planes and cards can be hard to tell apart.

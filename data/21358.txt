RATING: 10
My go to RPG. I will almost always want to play this over any other RPG, in nearly any setting.

RATING: 7
This is really a role-playing game, but what makes Savage Worlds "Fast! Furious! and Fun!" is that it was designed with compatibility to skirmish-level miniatures gaming in mind.  My rating reflects playing this as a minis game.

RATING: 8.6
Great rule set once you get used to its sometimes odd mechanics.  Allows large skirmishes to be resolved quickly, and with maximum fun.  Settled on this after playing many setting-specific rule sets over the years; this is much quicker to GM/Maintain/Play.  Highly recommended.  Mostly used in conjunction with 'Deadlands: Reloaded' & 'Space 1889: Red Sands' settings.

True, true, it is fast fun and furious.  Did a one-off adventure with pregenerated characters.  Really need more players than we had to pull it off in a timely manner.

Savage Worlds is a ton of fun. It is the game I am most likely to play with my kids. It simple enough that my 8 year old can be a game master, and is generic enough that it is easy to run almost any sort of campaign you can think of. I think the biggest shortfall for me is the lack of good vehicle combat rules.

Very odd seeing this on BGG, but I guess it is a miniatures game morphed into a RPG.  Savage Worlds is currently my favorite generic RPG.  Easy to pick up and play and not short on flavor.

Played this once yesterday. WOW! What a great system! I played AD&D and various RPGs in the early-mid 80's and have been wanting a set of RPG rules which allows the full use of miniatures (in wargaming mode, and Savage Worlds is it. Simple, fun and allows full use of miniatures just like wargames. Battlestations! is good but is restricted to an SF setting.

My RPG of choice.
As of right now (2012), I'm running 1 game:
- Evernight (expanded and edited)

I'm also playing in 1 game:
- Greetings from Mars (homebrew post-apocalyptic Australia)

An exceptionally good RPG.  I'm not sure how well it works as a straight minis game, so I can't give it an accurate BGG rating at this time.

Decent game system. Characters don't seem very different, game is very combat based, and abilities and laughably unbalanced, but it is very fast and user-friendly, which is nice with beginning RPG-ers.

I get the feeling this is better suited as a tabletop minis game.  As an RPG...

[q]Great idea, awful execution.  The text routinely references rules that are nowhere to be found, and there's no index so you're often SOL figuring things out.

It wasn't until a thorough reading of the [rpgitem=47891][/rpgitem] book and cross-referencing that with the [rpgitem=44199][/rpgitem] book that I pieced together how combat and wounding work.

Lastly, having dice pools made up of different dice is gamey and takes away from fast, furious storytelling.

Ultimately disappointingâ€”I love the format and where the creators are coming from, it just doesn't work for my group.[/q]

RATING: 8
Much easier than GURPS, much cheaper than d20.  The system is well taylored to skirmish gaming -- each Player Character ('Wild Card') leads several subordinates ('Extras') into battle. Though some mechanics are gamey, it's easy to adapt to your playing style. Good value for money.

I own both the Deluxe and the Explorer's Edition of this great role playing game... wait, what? Isn't this BOARD Game Geek? Oh yeah, that's right: this rule set makes for an excellent skirmish game as well (with a couple figures per side).

Recommended. This game fills a great niche needed by people who still want to play RPGs but have other life obligations (family, job, etc.) to also tackle and no longer have huge amounts of time to devote to character building or adventure prep.

Savage Worlds features a very flexible character building and combat system where the emphasis is more on the ongoing adventure than nitty-gritty design options spelling out everythting you can or can't do. For the 30+ crowd who grew up with AD&D or the D&D red box, you'll find yourself at home here. Savage Worlds is more concerned with providing a frame work for stories than covering every conceivable thing you can or can't do (or selling you additional $30+ books to go trolling for a few pages of feats and PrCs). 

My group transitioned from D&D 3.5E (a game I admit that took awhile to grow on me when i first played it but eventually liked a lot) to SW when we decided 4E wasn't our style and 3.5E had sunk under too much of it's own weight. When you need to spend 1+ hours making a PC or leveling in order to get the best gaming options and the GM has to devote the better part of a day making a respectable adventure, you know the rules are too bloated. Savage worlds stripps much of the bloat away, while also reducing the overall campy power levels D&D now features. 

SW draws its design inspirations from pulp literature and 50's adventure movies. The design adapts well to any campaign you want - high fantasy, Sword and sorcery, comic book, sci-fi - it's very adaptable once you learn the (very quick to read) rules.

Drawbacks? 

The basic book is somewhat lacking in "good" character design options - most of the best ones are clear at the start while others are neglected. The end result is that if you have a party of power gamers, eventually everyone ends up taking many of the same options.

Encumbrence is brutal - be prepared to only carry what's realistic. Gone are thdays of strolling around in full plate with a backpack of goodies.

Combat is fast but for the mathmatically uninclined, the base 4 calculations for success are awkward, as are the way wounds are tallied. It's managable, but it takes getting used to.

Overall? Savage Worlds is a great romp, suitable for seasoned or novice gamers looking for a rules-lite option that still can take itself seriously.

The best RPG system, overall, I've ever played. I cannot recommend this highly enough to players of RPGs of any experience level.

An RPG that includes mass combat minatures rules.  First and foremost an RPG and as such should not be part of the BGG database.

RATING: 7
The rules are quite easy to read and understand (Savage Worlds: Explorer's Edition [2007]).  They are long (160 pages), but not so complicated, compared to a Euro game.  The Damage and Healing rules are more difficult to fully grasp, but the files available from Board Game Geek should greatly help.  The rule book is usually very clear and well organized.  It is nicely illustrated.  The lack of index is not so much of a problem.

Very simple rules (for a Role Playing Game).  Can be played in a vast number of different worlds.  Lots of free online resources (scenarios, etc.) and published material.  Many Settings and Toolkits available either in print or in PDF.

Great game, the one and only problem is it really has a rough layout.  Its not fully balanced so it takes alot of work on the GMs part to keep things flowing and make encounters at least seem interesting.  Great price, great settings, great community around it so I fully forgive its shortcomings.  I have played and GM'd a few games of it now and really enjoy it.

Not really a board game in any useful sense, no more of a miniatures game than D&D 4th Edition. Never played.

RATING: 5
This is an okay "light" tabletop RPG. It is an odd conglomeration of both level-based and point-based characters, created in the pulp style where characters quickly become very powerful. I really like the one book RPG concept, but this book is a little too light for my tastes. The settings are interesting, but quirky. The best part of the Savage Worlds game were the PDF "How To" books for creating your own settings.

I do not get the hype here. These are rules for a tactical miniatures game. There are much better [geeklist=49183]generic RPGs out there[/geeklist], available for free no less!

This is an excellent system. Their tagline is 'Fast, Fun, and Furious'. I would add to that, 'Flexible'. This is one of the least expensive RPGs I've ever played. I bought 10 copies to give to friends and family for Christmas.

Best RPG you can play right now.  SImple, quick...cinematic--and it plays an adventure (an entire adventure) in one session where as 3.5 you can complete one combat in a session.

I used to play RPGs years ago but don't have the time to devote to learning all the rules of the complicated systems.  This one is simple and fast, easy to introduce to new players, ideal for me.  Also very adaptable.  I made a Sticky Burr (See stickyburr.com to see what that is.) RPG for my 2 boys (ages 7 and 3) based on a simplified version of the Savage Worlds rules.  We started a 30-minute session with a simple story and some skill checks like Vision, Flying, Hiding and Exploring.  It was a lot of fun.

Have the explorers edition; I've just played it as an RPG.  I started out liking the looks of SW, but I'm becoming increasingly unhappy with it; combats seem to really bog down, or are over in one shot courtesy of the wildly variable exploding dice. And I feel like I'm fighting the character creation system at every step.

Savage Worlds is a generic and very adaptable RPG/Miniatures game. I used it for all my skirmish miniature gaming and role-playing for a number of years, but lately I've been trying out other things...

RATING: 7
a skirmish miniatures game trying to be a role game, which to give it its due it does fairly well, role agme evterens may at first be rather frustrated with the combat system though complete newbies will find it simple and in a way rather elegent, quiet well supported with about 10 world books in print. Easy to make alternate worlds for with some imagination as the core rules are easy to bolt things onto.
At time of writing I am presnetly running an advanced heroquest style game using these rules and it is proving to be very popular

This one is ideally suited as a gateway into wargaming.  It has 2 pages of rules and plays in under an hour.  The combat system is easy, but also tends to create wild swings.  Probably not the greatest game on the subject, but it is ideal for a specific audience.

Super-light old wargame. Good fun, and it puts some of the main players' names ands few locations in my head. 

So far, the only "advanced" material I'm interested in trying out is the realistic command ruleset. Would be educational and add to the logistical element. 

Nice-looking game, and its smoothness has me considering the other games of this "series" from the 60s.

The Smithsonian edition has a fine map printed on hard board and nice counters portraying the North and South forces. This is a light wargame with straightforward rules and cool game play simulating the Battle of Gettysburg – the turning point in the Civil War. The rules booklet has introductory and advanced rules and provides historical footnotes. A nice addition to this hobby.

RATING: 8
Wonderful light wargame. 1 page of rules. Fun grind on days 2 and 3. Some issues with tactics near edge of the board and the battle flies all over the place but nonetheless fun, would rather play this than any current Euro or KS project. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great depth without a ton of rules.  With low unit density the luck of the die roll can cause huge swings, not a huge deal...just be ready for it and if it is over after day one, start over and play another one.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad little game, but it didn't do much for me. The gameplay is fast and streamlined, maybe too much so for my tastes. Based on the games I've played, it seems too easy for the Confederates to force an early win. But maybe that is well within the range of historical possibily. The artillery rules are  silly. They are made somewhat better when played with the optional (advanced) rules. Overall, too simplistic to give me a real feel for the battle, but at least it's quick and relatively fun. A good intro game for non-wargamers.

UPDATE:  The more I play this one, the more I develop a soft spot for it. No, it's not very realistic, but it's easy to play, attractive, and has a nice tangible calculated risk aspect that I like (due to the simple combat system and small number of DRMs). I can see myself keeping this one and returning to it from time to time when in the mood for something simple.

RATING: 6
Good introductory-level game that is marred by some terrain and rules ambiguities (the Files section on BGG clears up SOME--but not all--of them).  Games will play quite differently depending on the combat outcomes early on in the scenarios--often VERY differently!  Rare that the game is scripted to the actual battle; for introducing new players, that's a good thing.  Combat system basically affects only one side (attacker or defender); success against the enemy causes no casualties for the friendly force.  It's not unusual for Confederate "killer stacks" to go on a tear, but if they do that the Union usually can find weak spots in the Rebel line to go on a tear of their own.

Para mi un gran juego de iniciación. Recuerdo haberlo jugado hace unos cuantos, muchos, años. Pero aun conservo cierto regustillo de juego clásico, sencillote y no muy profundo y realista, pero con suficiente profundidad para no ser un eurogame o amerithrash de los que queda muy lejos. En definitiva the old Avalon Hill flavour...
Conseguido "mint" en ebay a precio de bastante ganga en su edicion 125 anniversary, para mi la mejor.

Actually if wargamers had thought to buy these kinds of games and then to have taught them to new players instead of looking their noses down at everyone who didn't know how to play a game with 30 pages of rules the industry might still be alive.

RATING: 9
With only 2 pages of rules this is a very easy game to play and with multiple, single day scenarios it plays quickly as well.  IMO, this represents some of the best gaming rules Avalon Hill produced line for line.  Short, simple, easy to grasp and remember yet with enough detail to make the game work....but not more than is really needed.  

The "mechanics" of this game are so simple it is insane, so I have no idea what the comments are about "clunky mechanics" but I strongly suspect they are confusing this game with another (perhaps with the same name, by the same company....they did several Gettysburg games guys -- try to keep the strait).  Perhaps they simply are having a senior moment?  The combat "mechanic" is a d10 per player. add all attack factors (printed on the counters) and add any combat modifiers (of which there are only 2 possible modifiers: Attacking up-hill and attacking into woods).  That is it, so I have no idea what they are on about with "clunky mechanics", etc...  

With that said: Civil War nuts may poo, poo the "lack of chrome" while ignoring this game (have I mentioned it) has only 2 pages of rules and can be played to completion in less than 2 hours, or if you want to do the entire multi-day battle, one evening (with ease).  But, even for them there is hope with several articles on the game adding options, etc from the Avalon Hill magazine "General" (now free on the internet archive).

Bottom line: I love Avalon Hill wargames, but passed on this one when I was younger as I was not then and I am still not much of an US Civil War fan....but with that said I am in the market for a SECOND copy of this FANTASTIC game.  It is that good.

This is right up there when I want to show an interested newbie a quick war-game. The game is simple but demands careful consideration when playing, it is very easy to get troops killed with careless deployment. A very swingy combat system ensures a good roiling game that produces many decisive results (one side will get it's ass whupped).

RATING: 9
I really love this game. The components are lovely and have that important 'historical' flavour whereby you know that the unit who just beat up Farnsworth on Culps Hill was Heth's Brigade...it lends oudles of gaming narrative which may follow history or create your own alternate history of what might have been. Very easy to play and rewarding. I tend to play the full 3 day battle which although a longish game really gives a feel for the battle! I also tend to play with the optional rules as found in the General Magazine which takes away some of the 'problems' of the 'Reb Super Stack'! Great, simple, yet fun game to play. Highly recommended.

Playing this one again for the 150th Anniversary of Gettysburg. Played Day one Scenario as a solo. Rebs captured all of Cemetery Hill but could not get Culps Hill. Even though there were significant Union losses the Confederates only managed a 20 Vps as against the Unions 18vps. So another Reb defeat! Good game though!

Another go with this game today to mark the 150th of Little Round Top, Peach Orchard, The Wheatfield, Devil's Den and Culps Hill. Great game but, ended it early due to the loss of Anderson's Brigade, Hood and Longstreet at Little Round Top and Johnson's too over at Culps. Prior to this the Rebs had seized control of the Tops and Culp in what was to become their high water mark...just could not hold it against all the Union reinforcements! No way in which the Rebs could get 15 Vps more than the Union...not with those losses!

RATING: 7
Simple, attractive, quick-playing game.  I like the first-day scenario; it plays well and does a good job of recreating the battle.  After the first day, however, serious realism and gameplay issues develop.  The biggest problem seems to be the stacking limit combined with the divisional scale: the Confederates can form killer stacks and just bash their way through the Union lines.  If you're determined to play out the whole battle, I'd recommend looking elsewhere.

The optional rules from the General are essential.  What a great intro wargame.  It's simple but it has some depth.  Of course, it's not 100% accurate or perfect but it does exactly what it should do in a pretty good fashion.  The decisions are interesting but the turn resolution and combat are fast.

Without the optional rules, unrealistic super-stacks are crazy but with the optional rules, lines are almost historically long and artillery is trickier to use but dangerous to charge.

Very rules-light hex and counter wargame. Would probably be an excellent introduction to the genre.  Fits a nice spot in my collection as a Gettysburg game that I can not play for years and still set up, teach and be ready to play if the opportunity should arise without needing to (re)study the rules beforehand.  Of course, the trade-off is that there is somewhat more abstraction in the game but I appreciate the simplicity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A battle that hooks many wargamers, including me.  The battle itself is a very tense set-piece battle, in which a lot of blood was shed. The battle is strategically important as well.  This simpler version of the battle emphasis on playability rather than historical accuracy.  But the overall presentation adn game mechanics are very well structured and in the right proportion, as the designer Mr. Taylor always advocate for a game design.

I got this in trade a few years ago.

It's an intro-level game of the battle. Each hex is 700 yards across. Each turn is 2 hours in the day or 10 hours for the night. Each unit represents an infantry division, cavalry brigade, or artillery brigade-equivalent.

The Confederates have fewer but generally stronger units than the Union.

The rules are simple, but once both armies have entered, the combat system encourages the Confederates to concentrate their more powerful units, and the Union to counterattack against isolated Confederate units. This feels unrealistic.

11/08/99 Received. AKA Gettysburg '88. I especially like the "first day" scenario that can be played in 90 minutes. I also enjoy playing with the "intermediate" optional rules from The Avalon Hill GENERAL magazine (volume 29, issue 4, pages 35-38). They add some realism without bogging the game down.  
For a couple of decades I played complex wargames with 500-1200 counters, 20-35 page rule books, with play times measured in days. I eventually tired of all that. I find this type of introductory level game with low unit density (82 units) and 2-5 pages of rules more fun for myself and *much* easier to teach. Its still has plenty of strategy without needless complexity.

I'm not really too much a big fan or let's say an enthusiast on the American Civil War, but there is always an exception to this case. This game is nice & simple as opposed to the previous editions of Gettysburg from Avalon Hill. This game is far more entertaining & time consumption wise it is just right. It is easy to learn & best of all this is ideal as a gift or first time game to start off for those novice level players for their entry level or for those American Civil War enthusiasts. Still worth hanging on to have on my wargames collection. Maybe once or twice a year i do not mind playing this, especially if time is low.

Played the first 2 scenarios.  The "non-locking" ZOC makes it play a bit differently that most AH wargames.  The terrain combat modifiers were eclipsed by the d10, which created more of a parity on the game board than one would like given the victory point values of the topography.

But I agree with other comments that more of this type of game could have kept AH in business. This was a great effort towards that goal back in 1988.

Great game for those interested in the Civil War that recreates the Battle of Gettysburg in a realistic way thanks to all the variants available and without too many rules.  Having visited the battlefield, the map and the game felt authentic.

Outstanding war game, board game by S. Craig Taylor who doesn't disappoint with his fine effort to bring the most pivotal battle in the Civil War.   An excellent piece of history as well.

A great entry level war game, and easy enough for anyone, with our without previous gaming experience, to pick up quickly.  Good way to break kids into more complex war games.  Used to own it, but it has since disappeared, thanks to my "ex".

A lot of things to like about it. Simple rules, big hexes that allow "stacking" without physically putting one counter on top of another, step reduction,and combat resolution without odds calculation for the mathematically challenged. Although trading 1 step loss for 1 step loss hurts the CSA more than the USA there were some rule suggestions that I cannot find anymore that helped this beef for slightly more serious players. Great execution for an intro level game. The colorful (Flags, pennants and artillery instead of NATO planning symbols) rectangular pieces visually  suggest divisions/brigades in battle lines. Inveterate tweakers could tinker with it too. Prior to the announcement of Columbias Gettysburg block game, I had already used blocks from Sam Grant to cobble up a block Gettysburg. I'm sure theirs is better than mine.One of the few games I kept when I dissolved most of my collection.

The extra-wide counters seemed really odd to me, until I saw pictures of the original AH Gettysburg from 1958(?). So AH went for nostalgia here.  Game play is a bit disappointing, although I do see the rationale for keeping it quick and simple.

[3 plays] I have only played the Union. Attempting to stave off a rapid taking of good ground by the powerful Reb units seemed to be both historically accurate and wise gameplay. The first two games I had uniformly awful dice early and throughout day one, so this strategy couldn't be fairly evaluated. The 3rd game I won 2 very minor early skirmishes, but that was just enough to set the stage for a good defense of the town and allowing time for reinforcements to start entrenching on the ridges. It made all of the difference in making for an exciting contest.

So, my initial impressions are that wild dice swings can make for a fast and lopsided outcome (that luckily is over quickly and allows for a re-set), but when that doesn't happen, this can turn out to be super engaging and fun simulation of the battle.

Beautiful map, adequate counters with good stacking rules that avoid annoying unreadable chit piles, and simple rules that allow for strategic decisions and wide open tactical options.

Most recent plays 8-23-11 with Garrett.

RATING: 8
A minor masterpiece of parsimony.  Small introductory wargame, with a low unit density and amazingly simple ruleset, which effectively captures the nature of 19th-century combat, the operational problems at Gettysburg, and the asymmetry between the Confederate and Union armies.  Moreover, the entire package offers a strong theme or ‘narrative’ and visual appeal.  The game exaggerates the asymmetry, as well as Civil-War attrition rates; in doing so, however, it powerfully conveys to the Union player the challenge of dealing with hard-hitting Confederate divisions and to the Confederate the challenge of contending with Union reserves and capacity to extend the line and turn a flank.  Game provides important talking points and ‘teachable moments’.  Accompanied by a classic AH ‘Battle Manual’, the game provides a rich package of teaching materials.  Plays quickly enough for completion within as few as two class sessions, and two-piece board simplifies overnight storage in mid-game.  Recommended for novice high-schoolers and experienced middle schoolers.  (Note that novices find it hard to win as the Union.)

For repeated play, the game needs numerous modifications, some of which can be derived from AH’s 1964 version.  The Battle Manual offers some as optional rules (section 10, p. 23).  I offer a more complete set in Files (‘Gettysburg AH1988 RulesMods TimSmith’, submitted 161016).

I like how fast this plays.  Frankly, I really need a fast-playing game that truly feels like an old-style wargame, with hexes and ZOCs and all that.  Gettysburg fills this role very well.  The only drawback I can see with it is that I think the play balance might be a bit off--the Yankees have a tough go.  I am now experimenting with giving them a Victory Point cushion.

As simple as it is, I like this 'little thing'. It reminds me a lot of the old 1964 Avalon Hill edition of the game. That game utilized a square grid and this one a hexagon grid so one might well ask, what are the similarities?

Mainly it's the size of the units which are Divisions for the infantry of both sides. Cavalry and Artillery are organized into brigades. The 1964 edition used a very similar Order of Battle.

Thus, you have a game where the Confederate army is much more compact than the Union and with only 9 Infantry units has to be very careful with them.

On the other hand, the Union player has 19 divisions but these are a lot weaker.

I must admit I would have liked something 'a little more' in the  way of optional rules but this is a fine introductory game to get a novice into the hobby and a good game for tournament play too.

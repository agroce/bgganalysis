Tried this out the other day for the first time. I couldn't help but compare it to Sid Meier's Civilization game. There are a lot of problems I have with that other game that this one fixes (better combat system, better and more choices for your tech tree, shorter playing time). Unfortunately it took four hours to play it (still, much shorter that SMC) so that was the only game we are able to play that night. BUT, it says 240 minutes playing time on the box, so you can hardly fault it for being honest. I had a bad dice roll early that forced me to focus on my "advances" (technology track) at the expense of buildings, so I didn't feel like I did much during the game, even though I came in second.

I have a trepidation of civilisation games. I don't like direct conflict in games, and I don't like heavy use of theme. Yet, I enjoyed this game. Its saving grace for me was the "Objective" cards, which gave me a focus on every turn. I didn't need to worry too much about other players deliberately scuppering my plans, because they didn't know what I was working on. These secret elements make your opponents more unpredictable; make their decisions appear less spiteful ("I'm only doing what the card told me to!") and introduce a nice Euro-style element to the game. Hidden objectives are a staple of the gateway Euro genre.

The game ran for five hours with four players, and down-time is a major factor. But there were enough good things here to leave me with a generally positive view of the game, and for fans of the genre, I suspect this is a brilliant title.

RATING: 6
One of my most disappointing games.  I was sure I would love it, but it fell really flat.  The barbarians seemed random, the tech tree wasn't particularly interesting, and the end of the game just felt like Risk as we smashed similar units into each other and rolled dice.  I also really didn't like the rolls for cultural influence either.

I would like to play this again, as I hope I'm wrong about it.

RATING: 6.5
I really wanted to like this one more than I did. It has everything that should make it great - lots of Civ feelings in tech trees, exploration, city building, moving troops around, events, objectives, mood, etc. But because of all that, it stays around on the table too long for the light weight of the systems. If a game is going to last 3+ hours (and this one will), then it needs to have a sweeping arch and appropriate depth. This one seems to try to be simple and perhaps succeeds but then lasts far too long.

My number 1 all time favourite game. 

+ EPIC and thematic
+ elegant system with intuitive rules (I think it's the most elegant of the epic games)
+ easy to learn, hard to master
+ very well balanced 
+ it scales well
+ it can be played aggressive or peaceful - very different feel of the game, but both very satisfying experiences
+ makes me feel like a kid again

- plays in about five hours (actually that's not so bad for the depth and the epicness it offers)
- needs a big table
- needs a few games for learning the tech-tree, only after 2 or 3 games you can begin to really see what the game has to offer ... but then, you are hooked

A great idea that, to me, is marred by some imbalances.  Love the board, love the concept, love the execution.  My big gripe is that the education track is a tad overpowered.  It's self-reinforcing and that means if an opponent takes it and you don't, they will get ahead on advances and that leads to rather important advantages.  Primarily it's because the education track makes it easier to get other advances by gaining and spending ideas (which then leads to more mood tokens).  The second problem is the economy track.  Again, if an opponents gets those advances and you don't, you will be at a rather significant disadvantage.  Free food and then free gold?  Sign me up!  I think economy is a hair weaker than education, but they're both still a little too powerful and/or useful.

And that's kinda sad.  The whole thing with this game is the tech tree and if there are any significant flaws in it then the tree has a problem.  And, to me, it does.  I've played this game a couple times and each time I start with education (after an agriculture or two).  I have to.  I'd be a fool not to.  And that dramatically detracts from my choices and makes the game far too linear for my tastes.  Still a good game, just not one I really want to play.

As many, I have been looking for a meaty and involving civilization game (I have good memories of ethernal Civilization sessions). Antike is good but I wanted something more thematic, Through the ages is thematic but I missed the map. I did not care much about others. I am not 100% convince with Clash of Culture but, at the moment, I think, it is the best game filling this niche.

RATING: 4
1st play - The first game to test my resolve to play each game twice before rating it. The best word to describe this was "slogging". There's a lot of downtime between turns, the barbarians come onto the board in weird attacky ways, and the player board is a mess.

I think a good player board redesign would speed this game up significantly, as a ton of downtime comes from watching other players take an action, then look over their own board to scan the 20-30 technologies to see what bonuses they get for taking that action.

It's possible that with another play this will become less of an issue, as I become more familiar with the player board and the other players do as well. It's going to be a little challenging to get it to the table again tho, as I'm not looking forward to it.

No 2nd play: the game was a slot, and maybe people really like it, but I have plenty of games I know I like, why bother acquiring this taste?

It's a very good game.  It's very much like the video game Civilization.  I played it two-player only, and it's not the best as two player.  I suspect it would be awesome with three or more people.

The number of things you must read and keep in mind every single turn is humongous.  I need more plays to get a better feel of this.

RATING: 4.5
Having been released after Civilization, I expected either some improvement or a quicker game to play. None of this aspects were fulfilled. The game itself can even be longer than Civilization, while not offering any addition or improvement. The tech tree is vast and complex, and every turn you must remember to look at what you're doing/have done in order not to forget. This is time and brain consuming. The commodities to watch for are no simpler than Civ's counterparts (trades, hammers, coins).
The scoring itself may be just a question of luck. Taking a card at each end of turn may get you further than your opponents just by a luck factor, and not by any strategy.
War is simpler than in Civ, but it is nothing new, just a mechanic borrowed from Mare Nostrum. Skip this one and get Civilization FFG instead, much better.

Tried twice at Essen and bought. Another fantastic Essen game. The first time we got a few rules wrong and the explanation by the guy at the stand was not that good. I could really see the potential though and wanted to try some more. Saturday I managed to get a game with Christian who obvioulsy really grasped the rules. And wow did the game shine.

Only played once - plays a bit like an Ameritrash version of Advanced Civilization, with very similar techs and "events" (calamities), but far more tech advances and more variability with Objective, Action, and Event cards and different types of buildings and units, as well as the explorable map.

RATING: 8
Clash of Cultures has a pleasant, intuitive set of mechanics. It streamlines the civilization style experience surprisingly well--and I'm a big fan of that genre even though I have a hard time finding excellent civ style board games.

Things I particularly like are the thrill of exploration in trying to find good territories to stake your cities in the ground. The tech tree is a neat hybrid of structure and freedom. The actions themselves are all interesting and easy to pick up on. The ways you use your cities have sufficient variance to be thematically engaging and mechanically useful.

Nonetheless, the game has its quirks and balance issues. One complaint that isn't really a negative or positive per se is that it lacks variable player abilities and more unique civilizations. Thematically, the cultures are very bland and it would be a lot more fun (I think) if you could pick a particular starting civ. 

Also, while the techs you can get have lots of interesting options--I'd say that combat is the weakest aspect of the game. There are very few interesting options in setting yourself up for combat; which is a shame since combat is such a core feature of the gameplay. Combat is resolved by d6 rolls with very few ways to affect or enhance those rolls. The most interesting part of combat is the "Cold War" leading up to it when players begin taking notice of their growing enemy armies and begin arming themselves--but the actual execution is... eh.

So combat is somewhat luck heavy and simple (not good for me). And exploration, while cool!, can also completely bone some players. I'm not super mad about exploration since it's the nature of a modular board. But I can't help but feel there could be more interesting options concerning how you use the terrain--so if you get a really weird starting spot you can make some unique use out of it. 

Furthermore, there are events pulled based upon certain player milestones. These are, as you might expect, somewhat luck heavy. Overall, they aren't too awful. But sometimes they can be--and I really dislike completely random screwage in a long game. Although the fact that players themselves cause the events to get pulled upon them is a cool idea.

Finally, while the barbarians add another interesting feature to the gameplay--they are just as simplistic as the combat system itself (moreso, even) and they get littered all over the board. It's very obvious that the barbarians should either be more interesting or there should be more of something else besides barbarians on the board for players to interact with.

My impression is that CoC is a very good to great game whose mechanics I like in general--but the random/bland parts can sabotage the good parts.

I found Clash of Cultures something of a mixed bag.  It pulls off the Eclipse trick of preserving the essentials of a notoriously long-winded and fiddly genre in a streamlined, relatively fast playing design. Like Eclipse, it's admirable how several systems slot together so smoothly. Like many good euro designs, you'll always want to do more than your three actions allow.  A wide variety of technologies appear to offer plenty of options. However, the ease of developing just about anything is unrealistic. 

There are several nice thematic elements, including cultural influence and the need to keep your cities happy or they will not be productive.  Nonetheless, the curtain sometimes twitches and we glimpse a euro resource converter with naked point mongering courtesy of the objective cards. I find those objective cards a little reminiscent of Nexus Ops in the way in which they promote aggression.  I liked that element in Nexus Ops and like it here too. I'm keen to explore whether a strongly militaristic strategy can work.

Something that Clash of Cultures failed to take from Eclipse is single action turns.  Three actions and lots of options make for a fair bit of downtime.  I probably won't play this game with more than three.

The rules are reasonably clear and easy to read.  They also gave me a good laugh with their notion of cultural influences "detected only centuries later": 
"Hey Asterix, I just realised that our people have been speaking Latin for centuries."
"By Jupiter, Obelix, you're right!"  

I found the production quality quite mixed.  There is certainly a big box full of stuff, but the miniatures fall far short of the standards set by FFG.  The cardboard monuments, illegible red text on the tech charts and the barbarian symbol hidden in trees are all disappointing.

Great civilization game. Rules are easy to explain and the combat system is simple too. I really like the exploration part of the game and the terain restiction in movement. All players start with the same resources and abilities but are free to try anything they want. The objectives cards give you some goals to achieve. The are also random events but they are nicely implemented and you can always prepare for them. It takes about an hour per player.

If ever there was a game that set out to be a mirror of Sid Meyer's Civilisation video game - this is it.  The game almost perfectly encapsulates the explore, settle, expand, develop, battle, advance of the video game in an easily managed and digested form.

Gorgeous bits, well planned components and plenty of them, battles are easily run and turns relatively short with an array of agonising options, especially when it comes to the tech-tree advances.

While I enjoyed the 4 hour game the length soured the experience for me by around an hour.  After 3 hours, I'd pretty much had enough and wished it could be over, but I suppose that's just my attention span.  Additionally, remembering all the advantages you gained from the various tech developments (things that were seamlessly handled in the video game version) became tedious.

Would I play the game again - yes.  But it's not something I'd rush to play.

RATING: 7
I must confess that i had great expectations from Clash of Cultures and the first play did not confirm them entirely. I believe that after more plays and thus a better understanding of the tech tree the game will make more sense. So far, it is below Civilization, so 7.5 with the possibility to increase.

EDIT: played again, this time with all the correct rules and there are goods and bads. The good thing was that the game took only 100 min, quite fast for such a behemoth, the down side is that the game did not have the epic feeling and the civ building thrill. Final rating is 7.

RATING: 6
As a civilization game Clash of Cultures felt better than Sid Meier’s Civilization: The Board Game. The hexagonal map creates better spatial dependency between the players. Otherwise the game felt flat for me. Different player colors are symmetric, so there is basically no guidance what strategy would be good for the player to pursuit. Most of the time, you end up copying actions from the other players. Maybe the game is better with the Clash of Cultures: Civilizations expansion.

A pretty good civilization game, set at just about the right level in terms of complexity to satisfy gamers.

About on the level of Eclipse in terms of complexity, and feels about the same in terms of fun factor, which tells me that this game should perhaps be higher rated on BGG.  

Maybe a tad on the fiddly side, with a tad too many event cards for my tastes, but fundamentally sound as an accessible civilization building game.  Lots of objective cards to consider, and you really should satisfy them, not to mention monuments to build, if you want to win.  Happy to come away with a win on my first play.

(Comments after 4 plays with an advanced beta version)

Finally: A civ game in under four hours that delivers all I want in a civ game!

Exploration? Check!
Diverse terrain that influences your strategy? Check!
Settlers and city building? Check!
Resource collection? Check!
City buildings and wonders? Check!
Armies, Ships and warfare? Check!
Barbarians? Check!
Floods, Earthquakes and Volcano eruptions? Check!
Cultural influence on other civilizations? Check!
Missions (called objectives)? Check!
Trading? Check! (although I'll admit it's hardly used in the current version of the game).

The game is fun to win, but even more fun just to play. Your empire spreads, your cities become larger, and your civilization discovers advances such as Irrigation, Coinage, Siegecraft or Priesthood.

The setting has a definite ancient feeling - it feels like being the leader of an advanced tribe circa 3000 BC, leading them to a glorious future.

There is a significant amount of randomness, though, which might not appeal to some players. There are situations where an unlucky card draw, or bad die roll will set you back significantly. There are probably games where you just can't win because of continuous bad luck.

But did I mention that playing the game alone is so much fun?

Current rating of 9 could improve further after more plays.

A tidy 4X game. Less economically focussed but more thematic than Romolo O Remo. Combat could use a little more special sauce, and random events are more swingy than balancing. For the length of game, there is little balancing to keep leading players in check (think civilisation' corruption penalty). Board is also much too big given the movement speed of units Downtime is excessive. Fine, but lacks elegance.

No sé exactamente si estoy muy contento o solo contento. Creo que le faltan cosillas para ser perfecto.

¿Y esto por qué? No tengo la sensación de mejorar mi civilización. Ya me ha pasado las tres veces. Juego, desarrollo, expando, sufro, ataco... pero no vivo el avance, ni la tecnología, ni las nuevas posibilidades que me da la escritura, ni sufro por mi cultura, por mis ciudadanos... tengo más la sensación maximizar mi euro colocando un cubito aquí, que me permitirá un ánimo allá para poder recolectar con la academia que BlaBlaBla!.

Por eso, aunque el juego me gusta mucho y los componentes son extraordinarios, el mapa es superinmersivo, el movimiento de tropas, barcos, todo eso es genial, sigo viviendo dentro de un euro mucho menos camuflado que en el Eclipse...

Otro de los puntos del juego es la orientación terriblemenete militar que tiene el juego. Atacar ciudades es genial, fácil, da oro, posibilidades de aumentar el resto de tus ciudades y fastidias al enemigo. Las toñas están aseguradas, porque el juego está orientado a ello. Es fácil, molón, productivo y para la civilización atacada, si pierde esa ciudad, no es un drama sin solución. Esto tiene cosas buenas pero también una orientación a lo largo de la partida al ataque y la defensa en lo militar que hace que esa otra parte de ayque, el aculturamiento no tenga tanto peso dentro del juego. Es decir: para mí, el mayor logro del juego, y tiene varios, es la aculturación: un invento elegante y genial. Ir culturizando el resto de las ciudades del oponente sin derramar sangre es "cool" pero lo militar tiene muuuucho peso. Es como jugar al Eclipse y pretender que en el último turno no haya toñas. Pues aquí lo mismo.

Avances que introduce el juego en mi mundo jugón y que considero geniales: el tablero personal troquelado; el mapa exagonal con la niebla de guerra; el movimiento de barcos que circunvalen el tablero; la obligación de colocar la loseta para crear lagos internos; las ciudades en crecimiento físico en el tablero; el aculturamiento entre ciudades; la posibilidad de tener 7 ciudades sobre el tablero... Muchísimas cosas. Ojo que el juego es un juegazo.

Por lo demás el juego es elegante, rápido, vistoso y enriquedecedor. Le falta la personalización a través de culturas, de lideres personales, de atributos o avances culturales propios de cada cultura, de diferentes tropas, de piratas que pululen por el mar, de 
más cartas, de nuevas posibilidades de crecimiento de ciudad... ... ¡caramba, estoy diciendo todas las cosas que están en la ampliación! ;D

Initial rating after one play. 

Really a neat game that I think work very well as a civilization game. I like the different technologies you can explore. The tech provides some interesting decisions to be made as to where to focus first. 

Combat was surprisingly fun, even with just the simple rule of dividing your dice by 5. Can be a little bogged down by players reading all their event cards but I'm sure it gets smoother as everyone plays the game more. 

Would love to get the expansion for unique civilizations some day but I'm certainly happy with the base game.

I was expecting to absolutely love this game (I thought it kind of looked like rune wars) I thought wow this is going to be epic. Wow I was wrong the game feels to short, too boring and is nothing like I expected. Now maybe the problem is that I am only playing 2 player and maybe the game does not work well with only 2. Rune wars had an epic feel and was quite a long game, this game said on the box around 3 hours.....if you have a nap between playing maybe a 2 player game lasted under an hour. It was lacking in any stratergy I really wanted to work to build up my empire, I wanted to struggle to get resources and to improve technologies etc. however I didn't it felt like it was handing you things too easy, I wanted to build empires and close in on the enemy....nope within 2 or 3 moves I can just go to the other player and wipe them out with 1 solider as long as they haven't got any soliders....can I build up my empire and have a great city....no not unless I have more cities first by which time I could have won like 10 mins ago. 2 player on this is terrible next time I play I am going to have to add more tiles so i am not at the opponent within 2 moves and wiping them out within a couple turns, but then I feel this will take the land struggle away. One of the biggest disapointments in gaming for me. Will stick to rune wars....epic looking box....epic looking game.....flatter then Cyril the squirrel on the side of the road

Hi, I am a frequent article writer for Plastic Soldier Review website. I am currently working on a second article about 1:72 figures included in board games. 
This game is on my wish list, but only the figures. The game itself I do not need. 
I am actually looking for only 1 infantry figure that is included in this game. Is there anybody who can spare just the 1 figure? Colour doesn’t matter. I will pay a good price + shipment of course.

RATING: 10
Clash of Cultures (CoC) with the expansion Civilizations is currently my only true 10/10 on BGG. I was swept off my feet by the gameplay during my first play-through, and after my 7th play-through, the game continues to be my favourite.

CoC attempts to embody the 4X feel that one experiences in video games like Sid Meier's Civilization and excels at it. Christian Marcussen has created a game that is heavy, there is no denying it; however, it manages to hold together despite the thick rulebook.

The mechanics behind eXploration are solid and the slow and steady creation of the map, with lakes and mountains that completely or partially block movement, really affects the gameplay - much more than in Twilight Imperium 3 for example.

eXpansion is well rewarded in CoC. Not only does it allow  for quicker attacks on enemy cities, but it also facilitates a neat mechanic called "cultural influence". It allows the player to gain victory points through the strength of his/her culture as opposed to his/her military might.

Through eXploitation of resources, players can build up their cities, to then collect even more resources, and/or build armies to conquer the cities of other players. Neat combinations can be formulated with the bonuses in the tech-tree.

Finally, eXtermination is a hallmark of the game. You are always building army units, either to defend or take cities. However, there is very little variety in battles as there is only a single type of army unit and only a few army bonuses in the tech-tree. The expansion, Clash of Cultures: Civilizations, is a must-have as it adds new types of army units and leaders to aid in battle.

The expansion Civilizations is a must have for Clash of Cultures. Not only does it include different civilizations that completely define the uniqueness of every play-through, but it adds new mechanics and combinations with the civilization and leader bonuses. Without the expansion, CoC would still probably be a solid 9.

As with every game, there are always negatives. The biggest one for me is that near the end of the game, it is nigh-impossible for there to be no king-making. There can be very large point-swings on the last turns. This is something that your game-group has to come to terms with; however, do not let it deter you from this excellent game. Lastly, one has to realize that CoC is a very long game. With four players, every game has lasted over 6 hours. Yet the game remains engaging and nail-biting the whole way through.

If you are looking for a long but engaging game that brilliantly mixes Euro and Ameritrash elements, this is the game for you. Don't miss out.

Clash of Cultures is a civilization style boardgame with simple mechanics.  I haven't played it enough to be able to comment on game balance but I will say that it is engaging and warrants more plays!

While this can be played two player, it is much more limited as such. With three or four this is a deep and approachable civilization builder that we really enjoy. With two, its a quick game that inevitably degenerates into a slugfest, though perhaps that is more historically accurate than I care to admit.

Wow! For me this is right on the money for capturing the feeling of Sid Meier's Civlization video game - admittedly with some limitations to the scope such as not covering as wide a period of history - while still being manageable in an evening.

I was on the fence before buying as I was not sure if it was worth getting without the infamous Civlizations expansion. Having now played it, I would not hesitate to buy it without the expansion. I have yet to play Nations and Through the Ages but I am happy with Clash as my board game equivalent of the video game. I did pick up a French edition of the expansion. There is some in-game text but hey, I have elephant minis like on the cover art!

RATING: 8
Clash of Cultures is a superb civilization game, but greatly suffers from low production values: the quality of almost every component is poor indeed and feels kinda rushed. As I could notice at this year’s Essen, when the game was launched, players boards are bowed, miniatures have many burrs and bends, masts even break off the ships.

Apart from that, the game plays very good: it has the right mix of complexity, length and interaction for a civilization game. Yet it still feels overpriced because of the poor materials: we can only hope either component issues will be improved soon in a second edition or the selling price will be reduced accordingly.

Initial Impression:
---------------------
Interesting Civ "4x" game.  The exploration is much more forgiving that something like eclipse.  The combat is very streamlined, and works well, although I'd still prefer the combat in Eclipse anyway.  The tech tree is awesome... and so overwhelming at first.  Players that tend to AP, and cannot plan their turn ahead of time will cause this game to slow down to a crawl.  I think the tech tree is cool, and I am looking forward to exploring it more, but I also feel like it will prevent me from getting to play this game much...

This is my favorite civ board game. It's quite sleek and plays with experienced players in about an hour a player. The tech tree is well designed, never quite letting you do everything you want to do. I particularly like the Goal cards which let you pick between peaceful or militaristic goals to pursue. 

It might lack a little of the richness that one might expect from a civ game, but I'm not sure I'd want the game to be as long and fiddly to accommodate that. The cities and countries do feel a bit generic; I feel like I'd like a little something to help the imagination a bit for a more immersive experience. Still, I'm quibbling. This provides a terrific entry in a niche that is unoccupied by any game like it for me -- empire building, tech tree climbing, negotiating and trading, skirmishing and obliterating -- in two or three hours. I've played it peacefully and played it aggressively and each were enjoyable. I am very eager to see the Civilizations expansion which may well address all of my minor quibbles in one small box.

RATING: 9.5
After just one play I was very impressed! Four players is fine and the system, very reminiscent of Sid Meier's Civ yet nowhere near as clunky, feels smooth and well thought out. Some have likened the tech tree to a puzzle to be solved and having broken the code becomes quite scripted. I see some evidence of the truth of that but even the classic "Civilization" from Francis Tresham had that quality to some degree so I'm not going to subscribe to the view that it is a problem just yet. I rather like the much simpler combat system here as there is enough going on that taking time to play a sub-game just isn't necessary. There is a lot to keep track of and a host of details to remember as one acquires tech, and I expect new players to overlook or forget to apply any number of conditions and restrictions, but this will ease aftr one or two games. The player's factions could use some personality which will be provided by the expansion; but, so far, I'm happier to play this version of Civ than any of the recent attempts.

More play (both three and four player), and my opinion keeps rising! A very welcome discovery is that three player games are quite playable and very nearly as good as with all four. There is more depth than appears at first and value in all of the tech lines that really need to be explored yielding many viable lines of play. The randomness of the Objective and Event cards can be a factor but we've decided that over the course of the game, owing to the sheer number that come out, there is a form of balancing which evens out the calamities and opportunities. This would not be true if the frequency was much lower - and mitigation for some of the more damaging events is everywhere in the design. 

I find myself increasingly impressed with the thought that went into this game. Bring on the expansion!

Love this game. If you have played Sid Meier's Civilization and were dissatisfied with the mechanics of military combat and how unruly laying cards down on the table for the tech tree, I believe that CoC fixes these problems.

Reminds me of Eclipse with the tech tree aspect and the map discovery and movement. Also (sadly) the dice rolls for battle. It's not the worst, but I wish it was somehow completely card driven. No matter, it's a fine and fun civ game that creates some excellent swingy tension. You need a couple plays likely to play well, but that shouldn't stop anyone from diving in. Pretty satisfying experience.

RATING: 4
The game has some fairly standard opening moves and a slow build up over the first three or four turns before things get intense on your borders.  The objective cards pretty much drive your strategy and make any type of specialization difficult.  Secondly, it is usually much easier to do the top of the objective cards rather than the bottom (military).  The end game can be an accounting nightmare choosing between objectives, conquest, and wonders.

Generic cultures, bland wonders, and a sudden death ending make the game less fun than it could be.

There is also a dominant strategy - get irrigation as your first advance to avoid famines and get the trade routes economic advance for extra resources every turn.

Not bad! Civ games tend to be long, and this one is no different, with the game clocking in at 4.5 hours with rules and still not finishing the last round. But, I enjoyed the game and would happily play it again.

Comparing this to Through the Ages, it's nice to see "dudes on a map." I appreciate that TTA abstracts that out to streamline the game, but it's nice to actually push some units around. I also like how a culture takeover is brought into the game. 

The other odd thing though about this game is that, on one hand, you have a dizzying array of tech choices, but it also seems too easy to grab any given tech. You don't really "work your way up a tech tree." Instead, you spread around and customize as you wish given your situation. It's a little weird, and it does mean you sacrifice a bit of feeling like you're evolving over time.

Generally though, fun game, and if given the time, I'd play again.

Bought it because it's a Civilization-like game, but not the best so far. Prefer Eclipse or AH Civilization because there is more interaction.

The game was pretty good. It's an enjoyable civ-builder well in the mold of a game like the FFG Civ. That is to say, a game way more concerned with modeling a board game adaption of a video game rather than modeling an actual civilization. I think this is one of the things that keeps Tresham and Eklund's civ game soundly in a league of their own. Furthermore, I think CoC helped me better understand my problems with games like this. They try to adapt video games by providing 1:1 representation of the chrome, but then, in order to make the game interesting, defer to some pretty cliche euro-elements. So, all that chrome just turns into a big currency converter ala Terra Mystica (maybe even more reductionist than that) and the whole affair boils down into a petty VP hunt, but get's procedural because its theme is resting on moving through the motions of the computer game like a tired liturgy.

It's probably worth a couple more plays, just to explore the tech tree a little more, but it doesn't stand out, though I think a lot of folks will like it.

This one is a bit intimidating at first thanks to the tech tree, but the tech tree is also the best part about the game, i think it's good game but the combat is too lucky for me, normally i don't mind this but the combat is too important and the game is too long for it to be so dice and luck dependent. I'd rate it much higher if it was not for such a big flaw.

[thing=40765][/thing] (CoC) is an elegant and streamlined [b]civilization[/b] game in which all players start with a small settlement and a settler. From these modest beginnings, each player will attempt to build the mightiest and most dominant empire, which is measured in victory points. 

CoC is a [b]4X[/b] game in which players will:

[microbadge=27583] [COLOR=#FF0000][i]e[b]X[/b]pand[/i][/COLOR] their civilizations with new towns, cities, people, and by learning various advances

Negotiation and [b]trading[/b] with other cultures is often required to progress and advance your civilization.

Most importantly, CoC is a ton of fun!

As an aside - I do not understand many people's complaints about the components all looking the same or the fact that there isn't an elephant. There is so much going on on the board all ready that I think (IMHO) that a bunch of different warriors, etc would just muddy-up the game play. The streamlined and elegant nature of the game is well represented by the simple and uniform pieces.

I am sure it is a good game but it is not for me. I'd rather play computer Civ, which is very similar to this, without the fiddliness and with a richer experience. Also, I dislike the constant objective cards flow.

This game is not only an amazing civ game, but it's an amazing game in general. I love the components (even though the figs weren't the greates quality but it keeps the costs down) loved the technology system. I really enjoyed the events to add thematic flavour. My mates and I really enjoyed this, and it was an extremely close game with 1 point difference between us even though we followed different strategies so it's very well balanced as well. BUY IT!

Very deep but fast flowing Civ-builder. Has a unique feel and the expansion just makes it more so. Very good artwork and the superb city/building sculpts add to the experience - let down only by the army sculpts (what's with the 1970s kids army set vibe?). Still everything else is very appealing. 
This is not one for newbies but a very approachable game for intermediate-level gamers up. There is LOTS of reading on the tech charts in the beginning but after a few games they general information on how the technologies work together sinks in. 
There is definitely the opportunity for a lot of conflict. As with most Civ games this is largely determined by the players themselves - it's quite possible to have quiet development if everyone follows this path. But the rewards of aggression can be large so it's most likely there will be fighting at some point. 
All round a very enjoyable medium-weight game.

Great game. Reminds me of the civilization building computer game genre. You need to build your technological capability, and at the same time balance that with growth in your territory and your military. Of course you don't have enough actions on your turn to do everything you want, so something suffers. Many tactical decisions to make each turn - highly rate this and want to play again.

Solid game. I'm not super excited by the cards, which give both random goals (not just at beginning of game, but every round), and random events, which can be both good and bad. Combat (at least with other players) tends to be limited to the very end. The game makes my brain hurt, and not in the way I like, by trying to think about all the possible advancements; and unfortunately feels like I have to think about them all at the same time. If I played this often, I could see that being alleviated by experience.

A big fan of civilization computer games, and this scratches the same itch as a board game. A little long and difficult to teach, but really fun. I know I still have a lot of room for improvement in my own plays.

Custom Storage: Plano box for bank and barbarian minis. Would like Planos for each player color, but finding ones that hold base+expansion that still fit in the box is challenging. Probably just needs a foam core insert designed for it so everything fits in the box.

Elegant.

I rarely using that word, but that's what I describe for Clash of Cultures. It's the most accessible Civ game right now (the real Civ game, not lite-Civ like 7 Wonders or Roll Through the Ages). All the mechanics works beautifully one another, and very thematic. There are couple of things that kinda miss for me, making me cannot rate it 10 like others. But, coming from the genre that I love most, this is still a great game!

A nice civ game. Unfortunately, already owning Sid Meier's Civilization (FFG Games), I was expecting a shorter gameplay and at least some simplifications in civ management complexity. None of them is here. The tech tree is a mess to get used to, too many things to remember and easy to overlook/forget something. Attacking here is just another way to bash the leader, much easier in the first 2-3 rounds to grow your own cities than to build troops. And the game tends to get longer as turns pass... Still happier than ever to own the other game.

RATING: 9
An accessible Civ game that I hear is less clunky to play than Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game. Played one 2P game with my housemate where I decided to take the peaceful route (in contrast to how I usually play games) and he went a more confrontational route, ended up winning by half a VP. Keen to see how this plays at higher player counts. Wish the expansion wasn't so ridiculously overpriced but hey, that's the secondary market and physical entertainment media for you!

The best attempt at CIV lite I have played.
Satisying choices, plenty of options for development, varied action and objective cards ensure each game plays differently.

Prefer to SM Civ as you can play well by choosing to develop your civilization, whereas SM Civ pushes you towards rushing towards a set goal, which can start to feel scripted.

The best civ game available, bar none. The rules are common sense and easy to teach but give a geat civ building feel in 3 hours or so.

Still, a great design.

Nice production quality and fun game (although I'm not a fan of plastic minis, and the latest printing has plastic cubes). I love how the Objective cards and Action cards have two ways to use them. Don't want to (or can't) be aggressive towards other players? No problem. Just work toward fulfilling the other portion of the objective. Unlike TI:3, you have all the information from your technologies all on the player mat in front of you, and it somehow maintains clarity without excessive verbiage. 

Overall, seems pretty balanced. One player lost a city with a temple to an opponent early on. It seemed crippling at the time, but that player got 2nd place (out of 3) and only behind the leader by 2 points. 

Will be fun to explore the different technology paths and various objectives in this civilization game. 

Negative to me is the plastic figurines. There's nothing wrong with them if you're into that sort of thing. I just prefer wooden bits. 

I just read that some people here on BGG complained about there being elephants on the cover but no elephants in the game. Really? Have they not heard of military units being abstracted? Wow, I'm really ashamed to call myself a geek sometimes. My interests really diverge from others at times, I guess. 

Update after 18 plays: I love this game. It's got the perfect amount of rules complexity and fun factor for strategy games. It's fun to watch the map unfold, encounter barbarians, establish trade routes, and sail ships quickly into your opponent's backfield and initiate a surprise attack!

Tech tree gives the illusion of choice. Gunning for Education and Theocracy to Democracy is the best tech path by a long shot, heavily reducing variety in Civilizations (and thus replay-ability). Could definitely have used some balancing. Combat is boring and certain cards (Archers, Siege) are hugely overpowered and gamebreaking if one player gets these and another does not.

RATING: 6
This game reminds me of a Civ version of [i]Eclipse[/i]. It's got a pretty cool tech track and the mechanics are fine, including exploration. It does suffer a bit from obvious moves in the early game, but it can diverge pretty heavily from there. You have a decent selection of choices.

Unfortunately, it leaves me with that same empty feeling that [i]Eclipse[/i] does. Just as it gets going, and the map is explored, and you start to feel like your empire is rolling, the game comes to a sudden end. I'm just not a fan of artificial timers that are designed to keep the game short for the benefit of the A.D.D. euro crowd.

My second play, five years after the first, was just as bad. It is impossible for me to care about such tiny advancements. 'When you build one of the six types of city add-ons, which you may do a couple times, pay two resources instead of three.' Don't think about the fact that it cost you two resources to get that tech and you gained 1/2 VP by doing it. You have to get VP somewhere... 

Add to that actual example the fact that the factions in the expansion are mind-blowingly out of balance: one faction gets a 50% boost to food gathering, and therefore tech advances, from t1; another gets a culture token if they can somehow make room under their cap when they gather three food, which they can't conceivably do for several turns, at which point it isn't a big deal anyway. 

At no point in the game did the faction abilities of two of the three players impact the game AT ALL, no exaggeration. The third player's abilities were completely game-breaking. I've never seen such garbage design in a slicker wrapper. Combat is roll one d6 per unit, for f@ck's sake.

OMG this game is just bad, bad, bad.

Clash of Cultures is a good implementation of the civilization genre, but it's too long for my taste.  My first game took over 7 hours to play, and that was AFTER the rules explanation!  The problem is that their are over 40 tech tree advances available to each player at any given time, and they interact with each other, making the sequence of acquiring them important.  It leads to a good amount of analysis paralysis.

But with this said, this is one of the best implementations of the genre I have yet played, and I am eager to try it again.  This time with only 2 or 3 players.

Players grow a civilization, from their one starting city.  Pleasant civ. building game where players take turns taking three actions - move, reap, cultural influence, improve, and so on.  The initially hidden map rapidly opens up, new cities go down, and existing cities expand.  A plethora of technology advances gives the players plenty to think about as they progress forwards, and a ton of game space to explore.  Objective cards, and eventually Wonders, provide plenty of focus for the players as they are the big victory point earners.  Really nice game - quite simple to play, doesn't overstay it's welcome, and an order of magnitude better than very disappointing pirate game from the same author.  Very much worth a look.

Wonderful, somewhat streamlined civilization building game with dudes on the map and everything. There is a bunch of good things about this game: the technology tree, the cubes that mark developments, the miniatures, the terrain tiles, the movement rules, the combat. Everything is tied up in one semi complex epic game. Major drawbacks are events and action cards that are way too random with questionable distribution of balance. Further, game time is as epic, we were never able to finish the game in less than 7 hours and lastly - Chemistry technology. Even designer is not so sure about that one.

We also played the game with Civilizations expansion which brings so much good stuff to the game. Most importantly, it brings variable player powers by choosing a Civilization in the beginning, which brings this game to a higher level. It also brings more different units and more buildings. This expansion is definitely essential, but still keeps epic play time and a slight imbalance.

[b]Update:[/b] With Civilizations expansion rating is increased to 7.9.

Very tight well put together design.  Lots of different techs, actions, and choices for your Civ in a pretty easy to learn rule set. It has a bit of a slow start as the game is rather resource scarce, and it can slip into eurodom leaving you working out if you have enough actions and resources to build those troops, use that card ability to attack that city.

The game guides you a little with objective cards and each has an aggressive and passive option.

Third:
Great game.  Just to long and clunky.  Needs to be streamlined a bit and made more elegant ala Eclipse

Second:
This game is just as good without the expansion.  I personally bought it with the expansion and didn't intend on playing it without the expansion.  But after a few plays, I found out that I didn't know the base game well enough to play with the expansion quite yet.  

So, the rating on this game stands without the expansion.

First:
My rating for this game includes the expansion "Civilizations."  This is a great game.  I like how the game pushes you in different directions you may not have chosen.. through random objectives and leaders/civilizations.  This keeps the game fresh and it has tremendous replay-ability.  I'm looking forward to playing this one some more.

A very in depth civ game with multiple paths to victory, all resolving around an accumulation of VPs from various sources. Really takes multiple plays to understand how to manage a civilization while dealing with barbarians, events, and other players.

Really like the tech tree, fog of war and city management. Couple critiques:

-First game was a bit long... not that big of a deal
-Seems fairly aggressive... guess you don't have to play that way but seems inevitable... I don't mind some fighting but there was quite a bit in our first game.
-Doesn't feel like a Civ game as much as a Civ themed 4x game. Would like a little more "moving through the ages" feel, maybe via upgraded units and/or city pieces

Great thematic, good looking game. Lots of variation due to land tiles, enormous tech tree and individual play style. 
We always play variable end, even in short-game mode. 
We often play with public objectives. (Get all objectives at the beginning of the game, select two that are public). No new objective cards in status phase, only a new action card...
With Civilizations expansion we often let players choose land tiles that match the strenghts of their civilization. Then we mix'em up and lay out the map blindly.
We never play with random leaders. We choose our nations' leader strategically 'cause some of them are better in the beginning, some of them mid-game, and some of them end-game.

Most of the time, we use a timer (cause my opponent is somewhat AP-prone). We play 30 minutes per player, but set pause during battles and status phase. When someone exceeds the time, there's 1VP penalty for each minute started. This results in much faster playing times!

Too complicated and lucky for the number of decisions you actually get to make. While there is a blend of American combat and European resource management I feel it leans too far towards the American side. I didn't like the tech tree because it locked you into specific strategies very early in the game and made it hard to adapt later on.

Hmm. enjoying this after being initially worried. There does seem to be very different plays possible based first on the setup of the landscape. I'm not sure how viable warmongering is. The variable endgame variant is good and removes the gamey smallword-ish bash without fear of retribution endgame problem. However, it makes the warmongering approach even less viable, i think. Interested in more plays as i see what other nuggets are there.

I was surprised to like this one as much as I did after one play since I didn't like the designer's other game, Merchants & Marauders. I felt stung by some unfortunate objectives that I pulled, but I still finished only 4 points out of first, and I know I didn't play as efficiently as I could have. 

This is a civ game that focuses more on the building up than tearing down; none of us fought each other and there was only minor interference. That's either a feature or a flaw depending on what you want out of a civ game. I found the objectives and action cards you get as ways to inform your plans for the turn, I just hope it doesn't come down to who pulls better cards. Perhaps the second play will reveal that there's always a way around the objectives and the game doesn't come down to who pulls more fortuitously. In any case, I'm very keen to try this one again and find out.

CoC is a fairly streamlined civ game that offers tech, resource collection and warfare in a nice, tidy package.  The events and objectives add randomness that add flavor and uncertainty, but can imbalance things with unobtainable objectives or events that hamper or even cripple a player.

One also doesn't get the "epic-ness" that one feels with Through the Ages or even Sid Meier's Civ, but all in all, CoC is an enjoyable gaming experience.

Have mixed feeling about this one.  Love many aspects of the game, but not the event text (which I realize is optional if you play a variant) and the combat.  The cultural influence seems a little weird too -- a two point swing for a die roll that can be boosted after the fact pretty easily.

Have played this one twice.  It's fun, the production is lovely, you enjoy building up your thriving happy civilization - and then someone comes and stomps on you.  In both games I've played, we've struggled with the transition from growth to competition to conflict.  Struggled to enjoy that transition, I mean.  I guess the history of civilization runs along similar lines.  Translation:  I haven't decided what I think of this one yet.

Really enjoyed this civilisation building game. It really flows (once you work out what you are doing) and it has definitely replaced Sir Meier's Civ game as my favorite.

The city upgrades are really novel and are really nice except a fully upgraded city takes up the whole hex therefore you have to balance any units/settlers there around the edge.

The upgrade board is really nice and the indents to put the cubes to mark which upgrades you have purchased is awesome as it means a table knock doesn't reset your board.

The inability to buy more actions is really nice as everyone is on a equal footing that way and the consistently gaining new objectives is nice as it gives short term direction.

Played 0.5 times with 3 players.

1st play: 6. 3p game that got a rule so badly wrong we had to abandon the game. I want to play a full game of this, but don't anticipate liking it as much as I hoped. I don't find the exploration/settling that interesting, which is what I was hoping for. The tech/city development is overly parallel without enough differentiation for each player's civ. I'm a big fan of the similarly-themed Through the Ages, which I rate quite highly, and find it to be more to my tastes. 08/14

Overall I was expecting a bit more from this game.  It is an okay good Civ game, but not great.  It needed another round or 2 to really keep your engine going, otherwise you get things set up and then boom, game is done.

There wasn't a lot of military used until the very end when a city changed hands and it swung the game from one person to the guy that took over the city.

It seems like the tech advances are not as great as they could be, and that it just took too long to get things going.  In addition, group think took over and everyone built roughly the same culture.

After taking a look at the expansion, it seems like you need that to turn this into a good game, but I'm not going to spend the money on that.

I was searching for a long time the definitive civ game that meets my taste and criteria :

1) with a story arc and narrative
2) with a central board to explore/discover
3) with strong and sounding exploration mechanic. I want to feel the uncertainty of exploration : success of failure ? what am i going to discover ? barbarians ? indians ? natives ? what kind of resources ?
4) with a simple tech tree yet accurate and rich to ensure replayability 
5) with a non required war aspect. Almost all civ games are focused on military. I don't want to focus on military if i don't want to.

I played it only 1 time but CoC was right up my alley and meets all my criteria : mainly, you can fight and recover with culture instead of military. With the expansion, it will be perfect.

Kudos and thanks Mr Marcussen.

I've been eager to try Clash of Cultures ever since I heard Tom Vasel's glowing reviews on The Dice Tower.  I'm a huge fan of other Civilization-esque games (Through the Ages is currently my #2 game of all time and I rate Sid Meier's Fantasy Flight game a 9), and had high expectations for this one.  Well, it didn't disappoint me much.  It's not quite as involved as those other games, luck plays a more prominent role, and it doesn't play that much shorter, but it does offer a few things those other games don't.  Here's my list of pros and cons:

Pros: 
- Includes a way to exert cltural influence: a non-military way of turning your opponents' points into your points.
- The map is granular enough that it look completely different every time.
- Ships and navigation play a prominent role, and the way troops can effectively sail around the board is way cool.
- This game is slightly more abstract and easy to learn
- Fantastic building pieces that fit together to form an impressive-looking city

Cons: 
- It features random objective cards without a lot of ways to get more or trade for others
- There is only one type of military unit and combat is fairly simplistic (which could be a pro for some)
- Plastic cubes. Enough said

one of my my most frustrating gaming experiences ever. I did what I absolutely hate when other people do this: I quit the game in mid play. However, just couldn't stand the thought to go through 3 more hours before the game would be over, without being able to do anything meaningful due to shitty luck with my event card draws and dice rolling.

A quick (comparatively!) civilization game that covers the 4X's well. The tech tree and exploring are cleverly streamlined and generally there is a lot going on but in such a way that its relatively easy to keep track of things. I really, really like this game and it comfortably scratches the ‘civ’ itch in my collection.

My only criticism is that the game can drag with AP prone players which can be very painful. But this is more of a criticism of the players rather than the game.

An interesting game. Not up to Through the Ages standards for development, engine building or resource management but still OK in the genre. Incredible downtime drag with the wrong players, especially toward the end of the game - this game can bog down. And it doesn't scratch the 4X itch, nor the engine building itch. Almost not not quite. It tries to do too much, not quite reaching greatness in any area.

Clash of Cultures is a great game. You can build an ancient civilization in around 3 hours, which is a really good (adequate) duration for a civ game. Even though your civilization never gets to the present time, it feels as you were developing a true society, with its own specific characteristics, technology and culture.

The flaw point here is, in my experience/opinion: war is an over-powered strategy that overshadows the others. So, I use a few house rules to prevent war from being so beneficial that, in order to win, everyone should go that way.

First play through was pretty bad. Gameplay is simple, and I like the concept behind it and the theme. However, there are too many effects that the player needs to constantly remember and as the game progresses it only gets worse. As a result the game is taxing on attention and leads to AP. Nail in the coffin, the event cards felt unfairly random.

This is an excellent civ style experience with a beautiful design and components. I was surprised from my first play at how eratic the scoring was, but maybe that was because I thought I won the game only to find my friend had snuck one over me. 

Regardless, we all pretty thoroughly enjoyed our play which means the game is fun enough to play without winning being a priority. That is no small feat for a game that will take two to four hours.

Additional plays may change my opinion, but my initial impressions are this:
Good:
1. FUN - tells a story and the interaction with other players is very well done.
2. Beautiful
3. Doesn't feel slow or rules clogged for such an encompassing game. Turns feel relatively quick.
4. You feel like you are building and growing a civilization that has an accompanying story to go along with it.
5. The mechanics generally align thematically, enhancing the story-telling element.

Bad:
1. Very difficult to overcome the randomness of scoring (which is what kills Merchants & Marauders for me). If the game wasn't so fun to play anyway, this would be damning for this game.
2. Long (but short for the epic-ness).

4x Civilization game with lots of strategies to pursue.  Technologies, wonders, and city development or conquest  are all part of the game and earn varying levels of victory points.   Additionally, secret objectives can be scored so players are pursuing their own hidden agendas in search of victory points. This last piece adds an element of mystery to each players goals and enriches the game.   Clearly inspired by Sid Meier's Civilization Video Games.

Clash of Cultures is an eloquent 4X civ game with zero fiddle! Has a map!!!

Trough the Ages may be beloved by many gamers but it drags on so badly! If you are looking for a civ game that has depth AND a much shorter play time, CoC is your game! And I for one appreciate the immersion that only a map can bring to a game. The game's intricate set of advances works very intuitively and resource management is a sinch. A ton of great minis that work well to depict your cities' growth. Even my girlfriend liked it! I'm looking forward to more playtime with this one.

I'm always looking for a decent civilization game that plays fluidly within its usual 3-4 hour timespan, interesting mechanics, and a real sense of development and growth.  Clash of Cultures, by its basic mechanics, is well-designed.  Building (through gathering and spending resources) is solid. I like how how the "happiness" of each city can change (though nobody in our game took advantage of the ability to wring out extra stuff from their cities at the cost of happiness).  Exploring was okay (though the rules about ship transport was a bit wonky, if only because of how the tiles are played out, not guaranteeing a developed water system.  And the turn / action system was quite nice, ensuring turns were brisk and meaningful decisions were apparent but never scripted.  But some things really annoyed me. A common issue with some of the popular civ games (Sid Meier's Civilization, comes to mind) is this gargantuan tech tree.  By the end you have to keep track of 14-20 different added effects.  I get why tech trees like this are included in games such as this, but I really dislike having to keep track of all the extra bonuses or rule-breaks I get from developing.  I found the Event cards were annoyingly random (some you could prepare for; some you could not).  And the Objective cards were all unbalanced.  Some I could achieve almost immediately while others (especially by the final rounds) were too ridiculous to ever achieve.  Maybe the idea behind them was that we were all subject to the random whims of the Objective and Event decks, but that's not how I like games to be "balanced".  I do feel an element of chaos and uncertainty is needed in civ games, but I don't like this approach.  Lastly, the actions that give bonuses during combat - again - they feel unbalanced. Does the balance come from collecting as many as you can, mitigating the luck of pulling multiple weak combat cards? Maybe. But that branches back to the main problem I have with all the card decks: a mix of weak and strong cards with the balance coming from drawing multiple cards over the game and hoping for the right cards to show up.  The combat system (very simply dice rolling and resolving) worked fine for me, though I usually would expect more out of a 3-4 hour civ game.  Overall, a perfectly functional game with a solid backbone.  But it's everything else that's built on its frame that just didn't wow me enough to want to explore this game further, given the time investment.

I love the premise of the game, a Civ game in two hours, and the clever way in which Marcussen put the pieces together. The game has its flaws (random strategy cards, uneven barbarian hut distribution) but I really like the tech tree and how the cities grow with the little pieces. I also like how the dice work in combat. I really like the game but my group is not too enamored so it doesn't get played often. I really would like to play with the expansion.

Thoughts after a half play with 3 players and expansion
Summary: A good game with alot of complexity and things to enjoy. An epic civ building experience that is better then most. If it would be streamlined to ease players into all options and make it easier go get an overview and if the randomness was mitigated it would be a truly great game. 
- You get a random civ (picked from 2) with a random leader and a objective and a random action card. You explore a random map, are punished by random events and role dice to decide outcome of battles. A good player can take advantage of some of the randomness and make the best out of the situation but a bit less randomness (especially randomness that have big effects on the game and are hard to mitigate) would be better IMHO.
- So so many options make for great variation. A tech tree with 48 techs of which you can pick 8 in the start but once you picked the start techs you can pick almost any tech. Many city improvements with different effects to build and action cards to play. 
- There is a big risk of a long down time as players get 3 actions in their turn and it is very hard to overview what is best to do and what happens when you do an action. If you do this you also get this and this with your civ traits and the techs you have researched. But then to do what you really want you need to get resources and to get them you need to make you city happy, raise it to level 2, which you cant do before you have 2 cities, and for which you need to build a building, which you need a tech and resources to build, so now you explore to find a place to settle. After a game or two I think you get into it if you are a seasoned player but the first game you just pick an option and hope for the best. Accessability is not good.  
- Many civs make replayability great. 
- Leader bashing is a big part of these type of comfrontational games that i dont like. 
- The game is very long. I like having a board and seeing the progress on it as the game goes on. 
- Tech tree is too wide, you can get any tech almost right away. That makes the tech progress seem less epic then the board progress. And many techs are not very good, they are in many cases needed to avoid the effects of a random event. Others are needed only to get to do other techs. And one is needed to be able to move armies at all.

This edges out Sid Meier's Civilization on most occasions when I want to play a Civ game.  Much of what was missing for me in that game is present here: satisfying, quickly resolvable combat, city growth, citizen happiness management, aggressive barbarians, secret objectives, cultural influence and "flipping" (you can't flip a whole city, but rather pieces of it, siphoning VPs away from the opponent). 

Every time I finish a game, I want to start again and try a different approach.

If I want a longer, more considered game with some euro hybridization (which honestly isn't that often) I still go to the Sid Meier Civ.

This game is a solid, dudes on the map, civ game with a very expansive tech tree. The game play seemed simple but there is actually quite a bit to think about with your 3 actions per turn and a lot of fiddy things to keep track of. This jumps up the play time a lot more than I was expecting as I heard it was the lighter/faster of the bunch between this, nations & tta. This actually turns out to be longer than those on my first play

I like the adjustments made to combat dice as an adjusted AH/EH success style but I'm not sure that is enough to stop possibly swingy battles that could decide the fate of such a long game. Also while I generally like objective cards and the ones here had a peaceful/military option, the fact that you draw them after each round is swingy. I keep getting ones that required all the tech from a tree that wasn't even going for and the battle options were situations that were rare or impossible in my game. If I had gotten them earlier, I could have planned for it but as such, I just ended up not able to complete them. Where as my opponents had cards that I could have easily completed. Also apparently there is a trade/deal aspect to the game between players but I'm glad no one used it because I think that could leave to kingmaking easily

Personally I think the game is just ok but I can see some good things there. Maybe if a 2nd edition ever comes out, there will be some streamlining and the game will get better

Civ game in the genre of Sid Mier's Civilization the board game.  One play, will need to update if I play again.  

Pluses:
There are ways to get an engine going via the techs
Has exploration and modular maps.
Plenty of strategic options.
Z-Man did its usual job of making a nicely produced game (although the cards are a little lightweight IMO).

Cons:
Tech tree wasn't very inspired IMHO.
Scoring felt bland with much of the differentiation coming not from choices made by players, but randomly drawn scoring cards.
Events add chaos and hit players fairly randomly, without really adding anything to the gameplay.

RATING: 10
Clash of Cultures is old school in the best possible way.  It reminds me of an open world video game.  There's very little limitation on your choices---the game is essentially telling you "here are 100 different possible choices/combos, what do you want to do?"  In some ways, that isn't a very modern design sensibility.  Most newer games are focused on giving you a choice between 3-5 options at a time so it doesn't overwhelm.

The gameplay is straightforward.  This is not a difficult game to teach or grasp, nor a heavy game despite its table of advances and plastic pieces.  It's the huge array of choices and potential combos on the advances table, most available with only a single prereq, that make the game sophisticated.  Not only can you become, say, an oppressive theocracy, but you can become an oppressive theocracy that depends on trading for income with little military emphasis.  Compare the depth and subtlety of your civ customisation in this game with Sid Meier's Civ.  There, you choose a civ and pursue the victory condition it is associated with.  That initial choice suggests (virtually dictates, if you want to play well) a certain category of tech advances and actions.  Clash is nothing like that.  Its add em' up victory conditions encourage play and custom combinations, depending on the situation and your preferences.

Being super picky, there are a couple things that I'm not as over the moon about.  The first is the objective cards.  I think they're quite clumsy, and, I never say this, but they introduce luck into the game especially near the end when it is not desirable.  I also think that the last 2-3 turns or so get overly brainy and long---you have so many powers at that point from techs that turns are all about activating 7 powers in one turn in a particular order.  There's nothing you can really do about this, but compared to the clean tech combinational simplicity of the middle turns it grates.

BGG User Jeff Pratt succinctly expresses a lot of the things I love about the game, if you want to read more.

Great Civ building game. Nice interaction with other players, but not to much. Two things to keep in mind. One, you are not going from age to age in this game,just growing your civ and the technologies it has available. 2-There are no elephants in the game :(.

RATING: 3.5
Not my type of game but I see the attraction. For me there are just way too many special abilities to keep track of. The tech tree is huge for such a simple game and most of the strategy seems to revolve around which techs to take and in what order. The game is largely one of logistics but without the logistics culminating in much besides the successful completion of objectives, so it feels a lot like logistics for logistics sake, instead of setting up a great play or countering something someone else is doing. Overall too much down time, not much interesting decision making, and frankly a low level of interaction outside of the occasional combat.

Avoided this at first because (notwithstanding the fact that these days Z-Man doesn't like to print enough games for everyone) it just seemed like it was Risk with a tech tree. That's almost right, actually, but it's also Risk with a ROBUST  tech tree, shipping and trading, meaningful but simple culture, etc. etc. It is scaled very well, and does what other games in this genre do over the course of an average workday without a lot of fuss, in under two hours. 

Woe betide the CoC civilization that doesn't develop a standing army--it's still a rough-and-tumble, trashy game. But there's a lot more here, as well.

Edit: The expansion really adds to this. It's got chrome, it's got just the right amount of randomness. It's dumb, smart fun.

Very well-thought-out civ game that distils all the stuff you'd want to do into sensible systems. Mercifully, too, it doesn't force you to be a crass, pre-set caricature of a real-world culture. All players start the same, as basic Bronze Age peoples - and diverge from there.

Downsides? The otherwise streamlined game bogs down a little late in the game, where it's easy to forget synergies between advances that you've bought, so it's tempting to re-check everything constantly (I take a few notes to remind myself of the key synergies - not terribly elegant, really).

Also, while the components are overall very good, the miniatures are icky.

This is one of those games that can be played as a brain-burner or intuitively, and either will be fun for players of that type. It plays very well with two, which is always a plus.

Update - the expansion does allow you to play as a boilerplate civ (complete with the de rigeur presence of real historical individuals who mysteriously get born in your nation even though it has completely different circumstances, geography, neighbours and technology base than the real ones) which civ fans inexplicably seem to think is more "historical" - definitely not for me, thanks. But if you want to add pre-defined civs with real historical characters, just like every other civ game, then you might enjoy the expansion.

The best modern CIV game so far. Mostly because all rules are easy to understand and simple to play.
However, I must admit to being too impatient when it comes to long-term micro-management games, and even though I find it a great game, I cannot see myself playing it too often.

A fantastic civilization game! Everyone starts off with the same resources and capabilities, yet very quickly they all develop a unique culture and story. The rules are simple and straight forward, yet your choices are numerous. The technology board can slow the game down a bit, but it also gives you something to do while waiting for your turn.

I'm tempted to rate this one a ten, but there's something about the length and the end game that bothers me. It's solidly an hour per player, which isn't a killer in itself. However, the tallying up of points at the end seems slightly anti-climactic after such a long time. I have no idea what would be better.

Must be played with the variable ending.

RATING: 7
A 4x-style civilization building game that focus on the antiquity era and its nations. For a 4x, the game has a strong eruo-inspired feel. There are many paths to victory, as all progress gives victory points. The strongest civilization doesn't necessarily win, the smartest and most efficient wins. Clocking in at about 2 hours, it doesn't overstay its welcome, but (strategically) is a lot to take in for the first play. Rules wise, there is a rule for everything one would thinks exists in a 4x game, but all the rules are clearly inspired and well implemented in a way where the assumption of how a rule works is almost always the case. This is one the of easiest to understand, heavy-ruleset games I've encountered. Strategic in nature, it helps to be familiar with the game. I have no doubts my feelings will increase with additional plays.

Suffers badly in comparison to Through the Ages, sadly. It seems as though Vlaada's removal of the map really was for the best--I felt it didn't add much here. I object also to the fact that the techs, while awesome and cool, lead to fiddliness insofar as you're nearly guaranteed to miss some benefits to which you're entitled. It appears as well that most civs will get most of the techs, which leads to an unsatisfying homogeneity. Opportunities for AP abound, too.
It's sad; I feel that this design is close to being great, but as it is it's just pretty good.

RATING: 6.5
For me the game is too random in that the cards and the timing of them which is not entirely in your control can really mess things up or grant you success.

The last game I played I was hammered by early disasters but then got really lucky with achievable objectives and won at a canter.

To me it has the feel of a computer game converted to a board game. Lots of fiddly things to track, this tech impacts that or the other and it is so easy to forget.

An excellent CIV game.

If we could rate the designer, Christian Marcussen would be in my top 3 list.  Also enjoy his [gameid=25292].

The game flows fairly well, but you will need to play a few turns in order to understand the intricacies of this one.  The tech tree has built in prerequisites which do not require a complex tree/branch diagram.  Really like the simplicity of the solution offered here.

Gives a good feel of a CIV game, and the simplicity of the combat allows you to focus on the CIV side, not war (although there are more than enough tech options, adding pips and dividing by 5, as in [gameid=232], keeps things moving).

The Event Deck, which triggers the Barbarians, adds enough uncertainty in the beginning turns.

The Objective cards, which are dual-use (Development at the top, Military at the bottom) is again a simple and elegant solution, giving players some flexibility.

Some nasty events give you VP, which allows you to stay in the running for total VP.


One player had some issues with the movement rules, specifically when an army moves in a mountain (no more moves this turn) or through a forest (may move again, but cannot combat).  Although this rule may appear gamey, the ROADS tech gives you some flexibility here (but your surprise attack will cost you some resources).

My new favorite CIV game!  Looking forward to playing it again.

RATING: 7.25
Clash of Cultures is a well-thought out, interlinked Civ game, with lots of plastic minis, nicely varied Advancement tracks, and plenty to do for the players.

Not counting any free actions, players have 54 total actions to advance their Civ and to acquire VP.  Some of those actions will be spent in getting big enough to get more resource income, so that limits the time for warfare and cultural advancement even more.

There seem to be many varied strategies here; though there are some fairly obvious early moves to optimize advancement, they seem to fork off and go separate ways.

Part of this are the many various Objective cards, which reward players a small amount for achieving listed conditions, mostly at round-end accounting time.

Another part of this is the random tiled setup, which alters the game layout every game.

In any case, after two plays you can color me impressed, especially with higher player counts, at how well it all flows together.

I am starting this at a 7.25, with clear space to climb from there.  I think that, as some have said, by making the Civs very generic, something tribal was lost, but on the whole this makes a very nice Euro/Civ, and it's clear that Marcussen has done his homework, and assembled a nicely blended package which doesn't overstay it welcome, while capturing much of the flavor of classic Civ games.

It's not the fabled Civ-lite, but it is a terrific addition to the family of Civ games, and a strong competitor to the best of them.

RATING: 9
(01/26/13) This is a very impressive, well thought-out design. Many of the familiar mechanisms from other civilization games are here, smoothly integrated along with some novel and new ones, to make for a quick-playing, intriguing civ game that plays in about an hour per player.

Highlights:
1) Excellent exploration feel, using novel 4-hex "region" boards, with placement rules to ensure larger, continuous sea areas, similar in feel to Viktory II. This means that ships have relevance in more areas of the board for power projection and trading purposes. The placement rules mostly prevent the exploring player from orienting the region piece to their advantage, ensuring balance. This is far different than hex placement rules of both TI3 and Eclipse, which do allow advantageous orientation. Such flexible rules allow additional strategic considerations, but at a significant loss of realism--how is it that a player is allowed to orient warp points, or arrange more resource-rich systems near their homeworld?
2) Interesting tech tree, reminiscent of the kind in Advanced Civilization and Age of Renaissance. However, most advances in CoC will increase the limits of "Happiness" and "Culture", triggering random events, similar to Adv Civ's catastrophes, when each player reaches specific levels in both tracks. Effects are similar too, mitigated by advances, but the player ultimately controls when they trigger their own events. There is enough detail here keep everyone interested, yet simple enough to keep the game relatively short compared to other civ games.
3) Secret Objective cards, similar to Nexus Ops and TI3, incentivize players to keep opponents guessing. There are two optional conditions for each card, so there is plenty of flexibility to satisfy the card militarily, or through other means.
4) Action cards, similar to the ones in TI3, which introduce "take that" and also giving advantages. As with the secret objectives, there are two ways the card can be used, giving more flexibility.
5) City size, capped by the number of cities, determines the amount of resource and unit production. Each starts as a settlement, and adds up to four special buildings, each with a unique capability, and all which require their own unique advances on the tech tree.
6) City mood indicators, which give a city bonus production when happy, and severely limits it when angry. There is a civic improvement action that can make a city happy, while activating the same city more than once per turn will start to piss the citizenry off, much like the peasants in Shogun.
7) Cultural Influence, where larger cities can attempt to convert another players' special buildings over to their control. This is similar in feel to La Citta. In LC, population is being drawn toward cities with superior infrastructure. In CoC, a city can slowly get converted to be under the influence of another player. Since each building piece is 1 VP, it is possible to win the game through cultural domination, instead of military conquest. This is a welcome mechanism, as it means the focus of the game isn't necessarily biased toward military, like what I've heard about FFG's Civilization:TBG. 
8) Three types of government are featured in the tech tree, each with their own advantages and weaknesses. It is possible to "switch" government types, in order to react to an opponent's strategy.
9) There seems to be three general approaches to the game, each with their own set of advances, ultimately leading to one of the three government types in #8:
a) Education --> Democracy
b) Military --> Autocracy
c) Spiritual --> Theocracy
10) Three actions per turn (just like in Railroad Tycoon), three turns per round, followed by a "status phase", much like in TI3, for 3x3x6 = 54 actions. There is a limited menu of actions that are possible, so again, there is a lot of flexibility, while keeping things simple.
11) Simplified combat, where more units means more dice, along with some tech modifiers and surprise action cards. Naval combat and naval transport are possible, just like in Viktory II. This keeps the game relatively simple and clean.
12) Simplified trade, where having settlers/ships near opponents' cities, can gain gold if they have the trade advance. Ships can also gain "ideas" if they occupy a sea area in distinct regions, if they have the cartography advance. This gives ships a lot more flexibility beyond military usage.

There are multiple paths to victory, each with a unique feel and flavor. The economics feels like classic Settlers of Catan, where the settlements/cities collect resources (but not randomly, as the players choose which sites to activate), and then those resources are converted into buildings or tech advances. The resources are similar to Settlers and Antike: food, ore, and wood, along with "ideas" (which can be used in lieu of food for advances) and gold (which can serve as a "joker" for any resource). I also enjoy that fact that I don't have to worry about logistical considerations, like feeding my people/armies in some "building" games, or dealing with pollution and death like in Antiquity. Still, you do want to get some basic tech advances under your belt, before getting better advances lest you trigger an event that you are not ready for.

The rules are straightforward and the rule book is well written, with plenty of examples. The components are of very high quality, typical of Z-Man production, having a similar feel to Ninjato. The plastic pieces are excellent, with the game having lots and lots of cool bits. Lastly, the hole punch-outs in the player tableaus--to keep the wooden cubes that mark the advances from sliding around--is a nice touch.

There is plenty to explore and like here. It's a solid civ design with enough granularity, as it does everything a civ game should do, namely that it does satisfy the 4Xs (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate), but simple enough that it packs a lot of fun in 2/3/4 hours, depending on the number of players. It starts out slow like multi-player solitaire, quickly escalates with larger cities, and cultural and military conflicts will actively engage all the players. I don't see any weaknesses or flaws yet, as it seems the designer has done a thorough job of developing the game. It simply clicks. I'm looking forward to introducing this to my gamer friends, all who are looking for the civilization game "holy grail". This may be the best balance of complexity (it's meatier than Antike), flexibility (just like RRT), and play time (not as long as Adv Civ), of any civ game out there today. I don't like Through the Ages, because of its "spreadsheet" approach and no map; in CoC, I can "see" my civilization expanding and improving, which is far more expressive than a bunch of point tracks. I still like La Citta more, but if I want to have military options and a tech tree, this scratches the civ itch. It's a solid '8', with room to go up.

Update (03/29/13) 5 plays: I absolutely love the exploration in this game! The region placement rules remove almost all player input, so that regions cannot be placed advantageously, unlike warp point orientation in Eclipse, or placement of resource-rich systems near homeworlds in TI3. The landscape unfolds naturally, and every game is significantly different. The region tiles are simply gorgeous, and watching large lakes and rivers unfold in the middle of the board is a delight to see. Thematically, this is a top-notch exploration game inside a very good civilization game. I'm raising this to a '9'. This is an excellent game, perhaps destined to be a "classic".

I liked this, but I didn't love it. I really liked the exploring and the use of resources. I also liked the tech tree, but it offered so many options that I felt a little lost with it. However, I can see the opportunities to really dig in deep with this one. I think this needs more plays to really delve into that tech tree and see the various intricacies, but unfortunately I don't think my husband or I really felt captivated enough to bring this to the table again any time soon.

My favorite competitive game of all time (with expansion). The perfect Civ (or should I say 4X?) game for me. Very thematic and very well designed. The expansion really is a must have for me. Beware though, this is a fairly heavy game and there are a lot of details, but once you get the hang of it (2-3-4 plays) it's awesome! It is also my girlfriend's favorite competitive game and we mostly play it in a 2-player low confrontation mindset (cold war).
Owned expansions : Civilizations, Aztecs promo. Also have the wonders miniatures from shapeways (that I spray painted gold).

What pushes the right buttons for me : the sandbox feel to it, the theme, the technology tree, the asymetrical civilizations, the city-expanding, the fact that it is a 4X game, some conflict without it being the biggest part of the game, and the perfect amount of randomness.

Buen juego de civilizaciones con desarrollo de tecnologías y exploración.

Sobre un tablero modular en el que la mayoría empieza sin explorar, los jugadores comenzarán a partir de una ciudad de nivel 0 (sin edificios) y un colono. En su turno el jugador podrá realizar tres acciones que serán basicamente recoger recursos, mover unidades en el mapa, desarrollar su árbol de tecnologías, construir un edificio o reclutar.

Varias de estas acciones se realizan en una ciudad y su potencia dependerá del tamaño de la misma (número de edificios). En ese sentido esta bien implementado el nivel de "felicidad" de tus ciudades, ya que activar varias veces en el mismo turno una ciudad hará que funcione peor y tengas que gastar posteriores acciones en devolverles a un estado contento.

El árbol de tecnologías es muy completo y pasados unos primeros turnos en los que es posible que los jugadores hagan acciones muy similares hay muchos diferentes caminos.

El combate es bastante simple. Tiras un dado por cada unidad que tengas en el mismo y la suma la divides entre cinco. El resultado es el número de bajas que haces al contrario. Así hasta que solo queda un bando. Antes de cada ronda de tiradas cada bando puede jugar unas cartas de tácticas de batalla que pueden mejorar la tirada, permitir volver a tirar algún dado, cancelar impactos ....

Cada tres turnos se completará una ronda. En el proceso de final de ronda los jugadores tratarán de puntuar sus cartas de objetivos que son secretas y bastante variadas, desde haber ganado determinados combates, ser el que más desarrollos tecnológicos de una clase tiene, o tener al menos un desarrollo de todos los tipos etc Curiosamente cada carta de objetivo tiene dos vertientes, una relacionada con las tecnologías o los tipos de edificio y otra relacionada con la guerra.

Muy contenido en cuanto a duración,es una buena opción, eso si, para mi por debajo de Nations y por supuesto Through the Ages.

Its a shame that some of the same shortcomings from M&M have been transferred to this design, instead of corrected.

I'm a big fan of civ games in general.  Despite that, while I enjoyed playing this game and would not turn it down, I would rather play other members of this genre given the choice.  It has an economy game and tech tree and area control aspects that are civ fun.  There is more of a luck component (dice rolls) than I like in a game like this.  The tech advancements are interesting and you can come up with some very powerful combos (some almost broken).  I found it not as engrossing as Through The Ages as the turn-by-turn choices are not as deep.  It didn't have the Survive the Board and trading aspects of MegaCiv.  It didn't have the tense race to the finish and exploration aspects of FFT Sid Meiers Civ (1st ed).  It has more conflict (with dice).  So in general a lighter flavor of civ with more luck and conflict than I really prefer.

It is a good game, but I was expecting a better one.

The game components are excellent, however I wish the gold and wood tokens were different, easier to differentiate. Also in the tech board, there are some requirements that are written in red, I also wish they were made in another color, easier to read BUT in general the game components are very well done, from the miniatures, to the (novel) tech board (I really like it, perhaps my favorite aspect of the game), to the modular board. The 5 piece city looks great. 

I felt the gameplay is somewhat slow, I wish we commenced with a little more techs because the first couple of moves are (somewhat) obvious and each player does them (irrigation for one). With 4 players the game gets very tense, but the downtime grows unacceptable, I think its sweet spot is 3 players. The play time is very long for what the game offers. The game is not complicated in any way, however it has a lot of rules so the explanation is very involved. The combat is also very random, both due to the dice and to the random cards each player has in his hand.

I also like how the action and objective cards can be played in two different ways, HOWEVER the objective cards are my main complaint of the game, for me they had a lot of uncontrollable luck. I was able to win because I had good luck drawing these cards, if the objective is easy to achieve with what you already have you can do it quickly and with low effort. I know I can plan to achieve the objective cards (and I do) BUT as you get them EVERY ROUND it is mostly luck what decides if you can play them or not. The wonders seem to play a very little role in the game :(. 

The event cards are also VERY random and they can help or hinder any player. I felt cheated when I found out that there weren’t any elephants minis as the game box art led me to think. 

Bottom line, a decent civilization game. I was told this was way better that the latest Sid Meier’s Civilization, but I disagree here. I would play Clash of Cultures again from time to time  (but not with 4 players) but I don’t think I will buy it or request it. This is WAAAY better than Merchants & Marauders.

Reminds me so much of playing Civ 4 on the PC. I love the openness and beautiful balance of the game. A very engaging game and the time just flies. Requires players to invest time to learn the game. My games have all been at least 1 hour per player, and often longer.
I've painted most of my playing pieces (with basic monochrome) and have devised a number of solo variants, one of which I've posted on BGG https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21553670#21553670

I'm relatively new to board gaming and had no idea that they could be this good! Have acquired the designer Christian's other big game and plan to dive into that later this year.

Waiting to see if combat is a viable way to win in multiplayer games.  If it is, the game will definitely move up in rating.  If not, might move down as it becomes a sim fest otherwise.

Feb 17/14 : Down rating to 8.  Still enjoy the game, but wondering where the clash in the title is.  Mostly a sim fest with the odd last minute combat for quick points as the game is ending.

Looking forward to the expansion in 2014 as it will hopefully make your own culture have a little more flavour.

RATING: 10
Very elegant civ design. Two-player has some issues, but is playable. You need to give yourself flexibility due to event cards.

--

Best with three or four, probably three due to length. Wonderful narrative arc to the game, especially as you (satisfyingly) become capable of dealing with event cards and watch the size of your cities grow. Lots of different tech-tree combos to explore. With the right group, I just can't say enough good things about this game.

Update 12/14. Expansion is amazing, and two player is quite enjoyable.  One of my favorites.

RATING: 9
Hehe, had to edit since I saw a comment on a 5 rating, saying the game felt scripted, since beginning was the same, yet I have yet to see someone start with Irrgation/Fishing/Move settler like he describes. Group think is not the fault of the game (like I have heard many complaints that player versus player combat only happens at the end of a game of Eclipse, but someone has obviously forgotten to tell that to the people I have played with)

I was afraid this would feel too much like eclipse, but it is all it's own game. Had a nice narrative arc, starting from a small settlement and developing into a grand culture through expansion and technological advances. There is a lot to keep track of and we made a lot of mistakes in our first couple of games, but it is a really fun experience with a reasonable playtime (1hr/player). The event cards didn't seem to screw with anyone too much, just as long as you knew that you had to be prepared. You have a lot of control over when they come out. Nice resource system and really great science system/engine. We didn't even go into seafaring in our games, so we still have a lot to discover.

Its better than the FFG Civilization game.  I will play this again. I won't play the FFG version again, but this is still in the same family. This is not a 'civilization' game but a board adaptation of an RTS style computer game. Civilization games should NOT about who can manouver their pieces best on a map. I feel like I am just playing Memoir '44 except the units move like glaciers over hundreds of years. Weird. Designers seem to want it both ways - heavy tactical military movement AND an epic timeframe. Does not fit together. How long is a 'turn' in these games? 50 years? A hoplite (or whatever he is) does not take 50 years to travel one space (around a few hundred miles). And no, the hoplite does not represent migrations of people. It represents a hoplite - this game (and others like it) clearly intends that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Not too sure what to think of this... the game develops really slowly. Random events and objectives makes the game too luck-based. I don't mind the battle system so much, altough early game you probably can only afford one unit and 1 vs. 1 battles are pure luck... getting an early lucky win against a barbarian can be huge since the game snowballs easily

Didn't really feel like you could specialize your civ that much since you get to advance most techs anyway...

Surprising lack of focus on warfare, with only a few techs and two unit types.

Since the game's scarest ressource are actions, some aspects of the game seem weak, like transporting units across water which take too many actions or cultural influence.

A clearly inferior game to TTA or FFG Civ.

Just not my thing, very tactical, very long term planning puzzle game that for me is more like the Civ video game than the FFG version.  While I like playing a computer game on a computer, I don't like playing a computer game on a table.

Very cool civ game, plays fast and well with 2 or 3. I really wanted to like this more but the direct conflict is just too much for me. I want to play and enjoy all the Euro aspects but the military part bothers me. I'd gladly play this from time to time but I don't need to own it.

This is what would happen if Sid Meier's Civilization and Nexus Ops had a baby. On its own (without the Civilizations Expansion) it feels stuck in adolescence: lots of good ideas that are partially realized. At the end of the game I could look at my civilization and that of my opponents and barely tell them apart. While there are diverging strategies and a fair scoring system that allows diversifying without explicitly rewarding it, it just didn't add up to anything of significance. 

Read my comment on the Civilizations Expansion to see how I feel it changes the game.

First of all, this is not a civilization game.  You do develop technologies but that is really the only civ advancements you can take.  Second, this game has a heavy learning curve and more experienced players will dominate less experienced.  Third, it is a fairly unforgiving game.  Early mistakes or battle losses can set you back irrevocably.  That said, the components are nice, the gameplay is fairly smooth and straightforward.  There is a good amount of strategy and multiple ways to get victory points (military, influence, objectives, technology).  This game has a very similar feel to Through the Ages.  I didn't enjoy my first play of either but I think the more I would it the more I would appreciate it.

RATING: 8
Clash of Cultures is a really nice and compact Civ-style game, with a much more limited time frame. Starting with just agriculture and mining (which seems a bit off, actually, now that I think about it), you'll never get more advanced than having steel weapons and cartography, but that's still a pretty nice swath of history.

I really like the way the tech (or advances, as the game calls them) work, and, being someone who will always, always, always go for a science or tech-focused path in Civ/4X games, I really appreciated how open-ended the way that progress goes forth in CoC.

Clash of Cultures is also streamlined enough that keeping your economy going is both enjoyable and quite manageable. I've been able to build two wonders in the course of a game, thanks to some long-term maths of the sort that really tickle me and fit my style. There's an element of accounting in any Civ game, but Clash of Cultures almost felt Euro-like at points, and I enjoyed that a lot.

Back to an earlier point, Clash of Cultures moves surprisingly quickly. In my first game, a thorough rules explanation plus a three-player game took us about three hours, which was a pleasant surprise. By the end, too, we all had completed a nice little narrative arc, and all our cultures felt distinct, with a history to call their own.

Okay civ game. I don't get the excitement for it though. First downside are the generic civilizations and the second one are the random objectives for getting victory points. I prefer the system of Sid Meier's Civilization which offers multiple paths to victory which you can pursue and thus lets you follow an overall strategy.

Jugado sólo 1 vez pero me pareció un gran juego. Dos de las cosas que más me gustaron fueron las siguientes: 1. Tiene un árbol de tecnologías intuitivo y muy bien integrado entre sí. Por ejemplo, si desarrollas el gobierno teocrático tendrás bonificaciones por templos y tecnologías asociadas a la religión, pero la religión te limita a dos la cantidad del recurso "ideas", el cual es necesario para otras tecnologías muy interesantes. 2. El tamaño de las ciudades determina los recursos y unidades que se pueden obtener, y el tamaño de cada ciudad depende, a su vez, de que tengas varias ciudades, lo que obliga al jugador a buscar nuevos territorios y por ello a encontrarse con los bárbaros o con otros jugadores. Es fácil de explicar, hubo que recurrir al reglamento un par de veces para aclarar dudas pero nada grave. De nuevo, un gran juego.

RATING: 8.4
Nothing else I've played comes closer to the feel of playing the Civ video games. You can have true, epic, sandbox experiences playing this as it's entirely up to you how to guide your civ through the tech advances you choose. Length is really the only factor keeping this from being a 9 or 10. Teaching this game to new players is not as bad as it would seem. The visual design of the tech advance board is a disaster, but this is a top-notch experience if you have the time and opponents who are willing to invest in getting into it.

Yet another addition to the civilization genre. This game thrives on its technology tree that has the ability to shape every game differently. I'm not sure how much this holds up through multiple plays, however, as some technologies seem head and shoulders more powerful than others. The use of mood and cultural tokens adds for more depth and different paths of victory. The paths of victory in this game are a subset of two main ones: conquest/economic. Conquest in the sense that you take pieces from your opponents through military or cultural influence and economic in the sense that you create very large cities capable of allowing you to garner the resources necessary to sprawl with even more cities. Scoring is simple. Combat is simple. Everything is pretty intuitive. This game should decrease in time length after a few plays. Not the best civilization game, but a pretty solid one. I still need to play this with the expansion, as everyone says it's a must.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the board game which most reminds me of the Civilization video game series, while also staying under the two/three hour mark.

Sadly, the only true source of interaction is the map, and thus, combat. Thing is, it's designed in such a way there will be very little conflicts throughout a session, which makes for a surprisingly solitaire experience.

Not perfect, but still fun enough. Would've been perfect if it had more ways to interact with the other players.

A good lightweight civ game: Very elegant gameplay and easy rules. A pity that it tends to be less exiting because there is not that much of a development curve. You get more ressources, can build more units and more city parts to the end, yes, but there is not so much changing in the choices between start and end of the game. Still a good game because everything still flows well.

Wow, what a great Civ game! While it can't include everything to provide the detail expected these days (thank you PC game), cuts are made in places I never liked anyway (epochs beyond Renaissance, for instance).

Would it be better with more than 4? Not so sure, as it would run exceedingly long. Looking forward to it hitting the table again, although definitely needs the right crowd (and a hefty time-frame) to do so.

Likely will replace Advanced Civ in my top 10 as it avoids some of the clunky rules quirks of the classic.

Great game! Easy to learn. Only 1 game played, but i feel it is going to become a favorite.

Great "ancient era" civ game. Probably one of the best combination of techs and playability while preserving flavour of that various civ games, but doesn't get into later periods like Sid Meier's.

Too long and random for what it has to offer. The mechanics are sort of elegantly implemented, and it's easy to learn, but as long as I can play a war game or Through The Ages in the same timeframe, I can't see myself playing this.
The secret objectives really should be somehow arranged by epochs to make them less swingy. The action cards also were pretty much hit or miss, maybe you could somehow houserule the randomness to a tolerable level.

After one play:
It was ok. But not more... A bit too long, I missed the element of progression (through the ages?). And both civs were too similar (although played with civilizations expansion). Also map (in 2p game) is quite small and there is no real feel of exploration.

For what it is, I think I'd rather play Eclipse (also only 1 play at the moment).

RATING: 6
This is a civilization game that focus on the cultural influence. It's not the main victory path but it's a possible victory path that has not been much exploited in other games. The cultural influence of other cities is indeed a very interesting aspect of the game.

There are still a few things that annoys me so much that it won't make me buy the game. First, the technology tree is very confusing. It's very easy to forget bonus and abilities and many of them have effects that are chained together.

It might have just been a bad game, but a player focused strictly on military and he rapped us all. I lost all but 1 and another player lost a city. We played a short game, almost in the 1st round, I lost my capital, and by the end of the 4th round, I was alone surrounded by my enemy. There was nothing I could do, not even research a technology that could give me an edge over my opponent.

One of the problem that lead to this is that all player get 2 tech at the end of the round. So in the end, he spent no resources on tech and let the game give him the tech he wanted. And all resources were placed in military. On the other hand, we built structure and technology, but this edge could not counter the military strength of our opponent.

This is I think a serious flaws. There should be more technologies that gives a military advantage to protect yourself against an aggressive opponent. Also free technologies should not be distributed for free to give a reason to buy them. At most 1 free tech per round could be acceptable.

We were also very far to build any of the available wonders as we were struggling or resources all the time. But apparently it is possible. Maybe in the longer game with a less aggressive opponent.

So in the end, I was not impressed by the results of the game. I had higher expectations than that. It could have just been a bad game, but I am still not convinced.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

While the game play is fairly straightforward, there is a lot of fiddliness with the different techs and remembering to fire them off when the situation merits. Text is quite tiny as well to make it all fit. Be mindful of leaving a city open to attack - losing a grown city is painful and a significant point swing. This will take some time to play, particularly if you have AP prone players as there is a fair bit of thinking ahead which can't always be done well ahead of time as the board state easily changes in that time, etc. The game starts a bit slowly until you have a bit more of an infrastructure built. 

I think the expansion makes for a much more interesting game with different leaders, country techs, and a few more different military forces. Doesn't really add much length if any to the game.

It's really hard to assess this one, as although it played fine with only two players, it probably is at its best with three or four. I think it's a pretty strong civ game, and I especially appreciate its idea of focusing on culture, and letting one player have a cultural influence over another's city (especially since that helped me win). The tech tree is a little odd, and it seems like there are some paths that are just plain better than others, but more plays will reveal if that's true. For me, if a civ game doesn't have a short length on its side, it simply has to beat Through the Ages, which is my current fave. This one gives it a run, but I think I still prefer TtA for this sort of thing.

After more plays, downgraded to a 6. I really dislike the objective cards, as they seem unnecessarily gamey. And I dislike that if another player decides you're playing Risk instead of a civilization game, then you're playing Risk.

so why do i like clash of cultures?  it really distills a great civilization game down.   you can build up military, you can build up economics.  just enough exploration.  I love being able to swing around the 'outside' of the map with boats.   The tech list is crunchy enough to be interesting without being overwhelming.  and i'm always a fan of combat where you add totals vs straight die rolls.  some randomness but a larger army should still win.

Rated 8. I really liked my first game of this. It was a lot of fun building up my network of cities and researching tech. It was also fun attacking my neighbours, although I was a little too enthusiastic which resulted in severe retaliation and I got nearly wiped out! Great game though.

Present 2014 b-day from Teri.

Edit: up to a 9, this has become my civilisation game of choice. I am not really interested in Through the Ages anymore, I love the maps and city building and tech tree rather than card drafting.

I bought this game at Essen 2012 after a testgame, but had not much opportunity to play until last week. After two more Plays (3 and 2 pl) i think this is a gem, comparable to it's competitor Civ from FFG and really underrated here. I have to try it more often to find out all the strategic Options it offers.

Provisionally giving it an 8 which is just below Kemet. This does the Civ building theme better than Kemet of course but I think Kemet might almost be the same game with a little less luck, that still has a tech tree and plays a bit faster. Rating only based on one game of the 4 turn variant which is not really fair.

Just a bad-ass game from top to bottom. Yeah, this one takes a long time to play but set-up is blessedly easy and game play is even smoother than in his other masterpiece, Merchants and Marauders. The ispiration seems to have been Sid Meier's Civilization, but I think this is way more streamlined and elegant.

RATING: 6.5
Rating after one play.

The game certainly has some potential, but is rather slow and relies on actually knowing the game. It's very punishing for new players, but at the same time allows for some experimenting - even if you'll lose because of it (and you probably will), at least it will not be by a big margin of points.

Takes a bit too long for my liking and is very light on theme, but can be spiced up by a little bit of situational roleplaying.

Haven't made my mind about it yet.

RATING: 5.4
I think I like the Sid Meir's FFG offering of Civ style games the best out of the modern offerings in this genre. This one is good and has some cool things going for it like cultural take overs and really cool pieces but it seems to be missing a couple of things too that I can't quite put my finger on. 

Still, Advanced Civilization is better, and so is 7 Ages for that matter.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very tight and balanced Civ game. This is a nice blend between Euro-feel of overall elegance and relative ease of rules, and American lore, trash and bash. Downtime is not a big issue here, as in-between turns time is devoted to planning your next actions. Different paths to glory really crown this game, for me, as the best Civ-boardgame-with-a-map. Can't wait for the expansion which should introduce different civilizations with different starting situations. And elephants!!!

RATING: 7.75
A Civ. type strategy game with many game play choices that focuses on advancement through a detailed technology tree and player interaction through area control on a randomised map.

Random factors make the game more interesting but do not dominate the game flow too much. For example you get dealt objective cards which you can fulfill to get victory points; these influence a bit your strategy but the cards can be traded with other players.

The game rules are very intuitive and easy to explain.

You get some quality board components, city pieces and unit pieces. However, beware of the petrochemical smell - you might need to give the pieces an airing!

The theme is a bit generic in that there are no historical civilisations mentioned by name; the only distinguishing feature of the in-game civs. is the colour of the pieces. However, you can build historical Wonders, e.g. The Great Wall.

Heavy game which takes quite a number of turns to launch, beautifully designed and quite intuitive. An improvement over Civilization as far as I'm concerned. There's quite a lot of things going on in parallel, in my view a lot of things could be left out to keep the interesting essential parts of the game. Unit movements over land are very expensive, which makes battles non-attractive. Fortunately, you can also gain victory points by "imposing" cultural influence on another city.

So far so good - 2 4P plays and I am pleased so far.  Not a huge learning curve, a fun and smooth to learn and play game. (Much like Merchants & Marauders by the same designer).

After 8 4P games my initial rating is a 9.  Not likely to move up, could move SMCtbg down though (moved it to an 8, I like the VP system here better).  An outstanding game that clearly has spent enough time in design and development.  Refined, many paths to victory, and most importantly, fun!

The biggest thing I miss is some kind of starting empire asymmetry like in most similar games.  I can see room for later techs and units too.  But, the game is clearly complete as it is.  It just can't get 10 with the lack of starting variability and asymmetry - both are key to me. Errmm.... changed by mind - this bugger is a 10.  We have played it 50ish times now.  Loved by all gamers here.

A game that I feel should appeal to me more than it does. The board feels too small for the implied grand scale, and the sheer number of options makes it hard to arrive at a strategy. I guess it boils down to the fact that the game in play feels tedious instead of fun.

Played one aborted training game at CBG that despite being a disaster didn't dampen my desire to play it again (let alone to own it as the copy at CBG wasn't my copy). 

Played twice [i]on the same day[/i]! Played the short game variant (4 rounds and 2 free Advances per Status round). Went really well and I'm sure we could fit a short-game variant with 4 players on a Friday and probably a 3 player full game. Depends a little on whether our super-slow player is playing or not.

Looking forward to this making it to GotM soon. Stiff competition though against GtR and A Study in Emerald (not to mention Syprium). I need more sessions per week.

Played a 4P short variant as a training game for 3 new players. It took 4 freakin' hours man! Not sure we'll ever get a 4P full game done.  There's a bit of a "rich get richer" issue that I'm seeing developing: if one player gets badly affected by an early event and another gets a nice boost by an early event then the end result has pretty much been determined. This may turn out to be a short game variant, only more plays will tell.

A really enjoyable 4x civ builder, many paths to victory via different tech tree options and depending on what objective cards arrive.  Fun in working out  strategies that work well together.  Keen to play again. Lots of scope for interaction. Long game but worth it.

Lots of detailed interactions in this game, particularly towards the end when the game can get to a slow grind.  Easy to overlook something.  But if I want a 3-4 hour civ building game then it fits the bill nicely.

In general, I love civ building games.  This game has a lot of familiar elements which I like, but has some things with which I was not thrilled.

The tech tree can be a bookkeeping nightmare.  There are a lot of ongoing effects which require constant attention.

There is a lot of randomness with the event cards.  I'm not sure how I feel about this yet.

Barbarian events force you to put a fair amount of resources into your military.  Not sure if that's necessarily a bad thing, just something that struck me while playing.

Excellent fast playing (at least until the final stages) Civilization type game. 

Loses a little for the random nature of the cards and mapboard development, but gains again for multiple development options in the face of this and is what makes each game a fresh challenge. A very lucky player (especially early) can be a bit of a juggernaut and an awkward map can lead to a bit of an AP prone Sitzkrieg (or death/glory charges) late on. Variable ending helps to mitigate this quite a bit.

The best available for fun and gameplay this side of the original Tresham Civilization.

RATING: 7
The game is not bad, and I like it better than the Sid Meier Civ game, but it still doesn't quite match up to the greats for me.  If it played to completion in three hours, ok, it might be a go to game.  However, it takes longer, and I would rather go for Through the Ages or Age of Renaissance for my mid-long Civilization game.  A lot of good, speed up stuff, but cuts some things a bit too short, like the miliatary stuff, and soem rather weird 'take over' actions where, from a distance, you can gain cultural influence over something with a die roll you can post-modify with no possibility to oppose.  Very to easily miss civ advance effects with the small, tight fonts on the bOards.

This feels like the first part of a new Sid Meier's Civ V game. We played our first three player game in about two hours. The components are well made and the mechanics are great. It's a very good streamlined civ building game. It's the only board civ game that I have played so far, but I can't see one being much better. No elephants, though.

RATING: 7
A good game, Clash of Cultures is probably the best in the civ-lite genre. I wish trading was more commonplace, but I guess this is more dependent on the group. For the first few games there seems to be a lot of possibilities, after that you'll notice the couple of best routes you have to take. There's still a lot of game left after that, adapting to the layout of map and the cards you get. Enjoyable every now and then, it's the passive aggressive nature of the game that sometimes makes it stay in the shelf.

RATING: 10
*Feb 2013* Money's tight, but from everything I've read about this game, I had to take the plunge. After reading the rulebook, it looks excellent and I'm glad I did! Will update after a few plays

*edit* One play. OMG. This game is satisfying as hell. Yes, it took a long time, but it hit all the right spots. Is it a 10? I'm unsure. Giving it a 9.5 until I see how it holds up

*March 2013* 3 Plays and starting to see the possibilities. 1 play with three, two with 4, 60 minutes per player appears to be correct. Excellent game, this is honestly the game that I look at buying other games and then go "but why? I already own CoC". I hope this honeymoon never ends!

*May 2013* 8 plays. Love this game. 3 is best but will happily play at any number (time permitting). I've finally begun to wrap my head around a working strategy for the first half of the game. This is usually the time I start looking for a better game and my "philandering" itch strikes up.... it sort of is but the rest of me is successfully quashing it because this game just does everything I love... Engine building, interaction, beautiful components, and other features. If you want an intro/gateway to the 4X/Civ genre (and are already a somewhat experienced gamer), this is the game to play. If you're already a veteran, you may or may not love it (some think SM:Civ is better, some prefer Eclipse, etc).

*June 2013* Only downside is the length. Otherwise, this game is fantastic

*July 2013* My 12th game was 2p and it ended in 2 hours. Length is not an issue so upped from 9.5 to a 10. Also, 2 players is a great time. There are more paths to victory than you'd think after a few plays. Terrific game.

Első játék után még nem olyan könnyű értékelni, de valamiben már biztos vagyok:

A játék szép, moduláris térkép kifejezetten tetszik, minik már kevésbé, azokkal azért foglalkozhattak volna többet is (játékélményből mondjuk nem nagyon von le, de kétségkívül nem csúcsminőség).

Mechanizmusa is teljesen rendben van, egyedül a kockadobálós harctól szorult kicsit ökölbe olykor a talpam. Oké, hogy szerencse, de egy-két gyengébb dobáson elmehet a parti is...

Cserébe van viszont rengeteg fejlesztés, sok-sok cél- és esemény lapka, egészen szórakoztató.

A játék mondjuk hosszú (nekünk 2 játékossal cirka 3 és fél óra volt az első parti szabálymagyarázattal), és voltak benne kifejezetten unalmas időszakok is, de akik bírják a 4X-et, ezt nagyon fogják szeretni, még a hiányosságai ellenére is.

According to Gavin, this feels just like playing Civilization (PC). Thus far, we've only tried 2-player, but it's fantastic! The tech tree has so many options, so much that it will take multiple plays to explore and find new combos. The down-side of that is we'll have to set aside more than an evening should we want to introduce this to new players. The up-side is the depth, the choice, and the game play. Rules are simple, turns are quick, and we can't wait to play it with more!

My friends thought I'd be right into this game, one look at the box cover and I thought they were bang right. The cover shows a huge melee with cavalry fighting elephants outside a step pyramid. Awesome!

Well, looking at the components it's something of a disappointment; there aren't any elephants nor are there cavalry. Each player's military is composed of semi-poorly cast left-handed hoplites with small shields. Apart from this the production values aren't so bad and the little town components are nice.

This civilization-building game takes a while to get started, but once it has begun it seems to play quite well and the cubes on the playmat is a pretty neat change from 'civ trees'.

The game itself is, I fear, flawed in that the premise of the game (i.e. clashing) pits identical units against each other with very little flavour other than the possibility one will have steel weapons or play some sort of one-off card to assist their combat dice. Sort of a like a wargame where there are only infantry units that all have identical combat stats. As the board itself is quite small it is highly likely there will be some form of conflict so I do think this is a genuine concern.

The other aspect of the game is, of course, civilisation building, which is always a bit of fun and this aspect of the game worked quite well.

In all honesty, I didn't find Clash a terrible game, but if I'm going to spend 3 hours or so (possibly less now I have an idea how it all works) playing a conflict-heavy game I would prefer either a wargame or some sort of sweet sweet ameritrash.

Combines a 'dudes on a map' type game with a civ builder. I think it balances those aspects quite well. I like the random map set-up, exploration aspect of the map. The game pieces are fun: cities are made up of separate pieces that represent different civil improvements. As the cities grow they can look quite impressive and help communicate that sense of growth. One of my favourite games.

Our 4 player game came in at a little above 6 hours.  Game suffers from AP player, but turns actually don't need to take that long.  The many options on the tech tree and for building can lead some people to think there is a BEST option if they could just think it through.  Also, because there isn't a large link between options(though some advancements are tied) it leaves some people feeling the need to think out each long chain during each play in order to get the RIGHT chain constructed.  I look at CO2 as a good example of a well integrated game where links between actions and net results are clear and assist with quickening game play - in other words, its lacking an integrated blend of strategic and tactical.  I played quickly and won the game without challenge.  Should be a 3 hour game tops.

Certain things I liked about it: though battle is an option, there are peaceful paths to victory.  Cultural influence actions and end of game points for advancements and buildings built are 2 examples.  Also, advancements that reward trade.  I am not hot on games that seem to force battle as the main path to victory (game of thrones, shogun, and eclipse come to mind).  On the flipside, not as dry as non-combat games like Terramystica.  I would play again with a different mix (our same mix with commitment for reasonable action times).  

Otherwise, nice components and clear mechanics.  I would house rule out the alliances and non-advancement related trading mechanics though.  Adds to the time to play the game

Had a blast playing this. This has a really clean and elegant tech tree. Probably the best realization of the mechanic I have played. Played it with two. Probably better with more players, but with 2 still a great game.

Have been playing more. It gets better and better. I get the sweeping feeling of building a civilization without the unfortunate necessity of actually spending centures doing it. Or 5 hours. 3 hours sounds equitable to me.

Ok, the expansion might be the coolest expansion I have for ANY of my games. This pushes it to a rare 10.

Clash of Cultures takes the "civ" game and re-works it into a complete experience which should run in about 45 minutes per payer once you are familiar with the game.
The mechanics are extremely well meshed together and the combat system is clear and simple which means more time to plan your strategy and not spend it rolling dice.
RECOMMENDED.

I might like this better than FFG's Civilization becase it is more streamlined, plays faster, and a more cohesive timeline.  (And it doesn't pit Abraham Lincoln against Cleopatra).  Still, it is a meaty game that takes a long time to play so it will not get to the table often.

Wow, this is an incredible game. It's a civilization game but it's very streamlined and easy to teach. There is little need to reach for the rulebook while playing because the player aids and player sheet show you all you need to know.

I like how open-ended it is. This game allows for many different strategies, and you often adapt to new conditions that appear during the game, like revealed terrain and objective cards. So every play feels different from the last one.

Even if I lose, I can't wait to play it again and try a new strategy. There is warfare, cultural influence, city-building, trade routes, exploration and great wonders... this game has something for everyone!

This is an easy 10 for me given my big-game, historic, civilization gaming tastes.  Exploration and tile art is even better than Sid Meir Civ and I really like the Action, Objective, and Event Cards addition.  Dual-use "Peaceful vs. Military" cards are a novel feature.  Greater intensity and focus required to play well compared to other civ-builders due to limited actions and much shorter game length with a clear ending time.  The tech-tree is amazingly varied and balanced and the tech-board cut outs for the marker cubes is appreciated greatly.  Good quality plastic and originality in improving upon this oft-repeated game theme is to be highly applauded.  Battle quality and battle cards are well done and exciting to resolve.  Will have to lower a few other ratings due to the release of this game as this has potential to break into my personal Top 10 after further play.  Well done, Mr. Marcussen and THANK YOU!!

Never seen a game that clearly and simple. But all fits perfectly together.

Starting with the real interesting advance-board and holes for put in cubes, the little parts as you can build up your city with pices and the cards itself.

But driven by the gameplay it looks like you have unlimited variants of build up your Culture by the right choice of advances is not force you as other Civ games to a railroad line of tactic. And even after several games i´m still impressed by the variances which will appear in games.

I strongly recommend this as a "short" Civ game.

Oct 2012: Initial rating (7.5) after our first game, 3 players, took 4 hours. 
It was fun and feels very different than other civ games (TtA, FFG Civ, Eclipse). 
We all want to play again, so that's a good sign :-)
One of the players claimed that the impact of bad draws of objective and/or action cards is significant, we'll see after more plays if that's really the case. 
--------------------------
Nov 2012: rating upped to 8 after 2nd play with 3 players (1 newbie). Game took exactly 1 hour per player.
regarding bad draws, I had the feeling the cards were usually usefull, so can't complain, the other players agreed.
Really want to play this with 4 now and see how that feels.

Note: this rating is with the expansion. Probably a 8 without it.

Well, I hate to say it, but I think this beats Sid Meir's Civ that I've owned for years, and have all the expansions for.

Still, it's close and kind of depends on the group. Clash of Cultures is definitely more approachable.

I guess if I was going to compare I'd say Clash of Cultures is more like a console game: bright, easier interface, pretty, fun, more kind of 'gamey'. Sid Meir's Civ is more like a PC game - more moving parts, more complex, interface a bit more fussy and fiddly, and the aesthetics are more like: attractive and functional but not blingy. Sid Meir's Civ is definitely deeper, and especially in combat you have way more control, but is it more 'fun'??? For me it's close but the ease of Clash of Cultures makes it more 'fun'.

I like the exclusive focus on antiquity, the diversity of the tech tree, and the limitations on constant military aggression.  What I don't like so much is the spatial emphasis, the occasional ultra-screwage of an unlucky event card, and the pressure to participate in the arms race once someone else really starts to run it.  This doesn't top Sid Meier's Civilization:  The Board Game, but those are huge shoes to fill.  There's plenty of room for both of them in your collection if you're a fan of the civ genre.

Great game! It reminds very well the video game. The explications takes time to a new player but after several rounds, it becomes relatively fluent. We always used the expansion Civilizations and it doesn't make the gamen heavier and it's more attractive. We really have the feeling that we are developping our empire. The reality historic is well reproducted in the mecanisms. It takes time to play (3-4h30). Each game we played were different (variations come from the events, the different strategies developped by the players). I really recommend this game to players who like long game with freedom in the different strategies and developments.

The choice was between this game, which is quite OK, and Archipelago.  And to be sure, Clash of Cultures is a marked improvement over FFG's Civilization what with the malleable tech tree and the combat system that's better than RPS (even if it *is* a dice roll).  But the heart wants what it wants.  I bought Archipelago and only the heavy gamers will consider it.  I'm fine with that.

But for a civ-builder, it's quick (under 2hrs w/ 3p) and fun (you're not locked into any one path even if you NEED some military) and it comes closer to the Speed Civ dream than anything else I've recently played.  My co-worker called it "the gateway game to heavy games" and I totally get what he's saying.  Recommended for heavy game vets and new-kids alike.

-> Luck only afects combat rarely, but is an important factors in other areas (events, barbarians). It can be minimized by researching the proper tech but still, being able to conquer barbarian cities early provides a huge push.
-> Somewhat long, but doesn't drag too much
-> Components are quite good (not great; holes for techs in player board are a great idea)
-> No special abilities for players: they are all the same (adressed in expansion).
-> Language barrier (we have a Spanish edition, but the price difference is huge! Also, the translation sucks.
-> Combat is simple and fast.
-> The tree tech is great; there are many, many useful techs, but no one seems ultra-powerful (maybe the education tree is overpowered?)
-> Nice replayability, but people probably will tend to repeat strategies.
-> Not sure several ways to victory are possible. At the end of the day, you need a big production city -> Most ideal strategies will converge at least in part.
-> The tile deploying mechanic is easy and cool.
-> Includes some cool mechanics (city growth, city influence, etc.)

Most of my inintial concerns turned out to be false :-)
I raised my rating to a 7.5 after my first play. 8.0 after my second one. But I dropped it to 7 after 5 plays, because i have seen the same strategies and techs researched over and over. I finally traded it out.

It's essentially a boardgame version of Sid Meier's Civilization, so there's nothing wrong with that. And if you're thinking to yourself "Wait! They already did a boardgame version of Sid Meier's Civilization", then you would be correct.  They did, and it's rehashed here in this game. 

Clash of Cultures suffer from awkward endgame conditions that argue against a military strategy.  In one play a player dominated half the board, quickly wiping out an opponent, but lost by a wide margin to two civilizations that simply turtled and refused to play anything other than a solitaire strategy.  It is disappointing because this is a game I want to like, but there are few meaningful decisions to be made here.

Ultimately, you'll get about as much done in 2 hours of this game as you'll get done in about 10 minutes playing Civ 5 on the PC.  Nothing wrong with that, just be aware that this doesn't add any new concepts to the genre.

It also says something that the game has not seen any play amongst the game group after the initial excitement died down and we actually tried it.

This is a great game! It offers so many options and ways to win. The tech tree is overwhelming at first but once you get the synergies it's a joy to build your motor to run your civ. The action cards which add some versatility or a boost to your actions, the objective cards which add some direction but never restrain you on your way to obtain victory and the event cards which spice up the game and add some tension make Clash of Cultures an amazing Civ package which I recommend to anyone who is interested in these kinds of games. Not only rulewise did Christian create a great game but also thematically Clash is very immersive and does not feel gamey. Go get it!

Cosa vi devo dire, non è scoppiata la scintilla, per correttezza però ammetto che il gioco andrebbe giocato più volte per essere appreso e io invece ho fatto al momento un'unica partita. E' il tipico gioco però che a me scoraggia. Si tratta di gioco di combo dove ogni civiltà ha a disposizione 48 differenti sviluppi tecnologici, senza contare quelli dei leader dell'espansione, e in base a questi si dovrà far crescere e sviluppare la propria civiltà. Oltre a questo abbiamo i leader, le meraviglie, le flotte, 3 diverse armate di terra, i coloni, le città e tutti i loro (7 con l'espansione) sviluppi, oltre a forme di governo eccetera. L'aspetto strategico del gioco, che forse è predominante è affiancato dalle fasi di sviluppo sul territorio e quindi guerre che però risultano pesantemente influenzata dal lancio dei dadi. Un gioco da approfondire che però richiede tempo e partite per essere appreso e apprezzato.

I used to own Sid Meiers Civilization by Fantasy Flight Games, but felt it was too random, too much Chrome / fiddly. Clash of Cultures is the better game - less luck, more control over what is going on.  It doesn't have quite the Epic scope of stone age to space flight, but it is more balanced and plays a lot more smoothly.

The 'tech tree' is really wide open on this game!  The AP prone are going to have a headache figuring out what advances to take and how they interact.  Obviously, with experience this would become easier.  In my first game, I found it hard to remember all the different bonuses and synergies that I had - the player board, while good, maybe could have done a better job at helping players track that.  It is very easy to miss a bonus or ability that you have!

There are no asymmetrical powers between the players, but the hidden objectives induce players to take different paths and hence different strategies and technologies.  Also, depending on where Barbarians pop up (i.e. treasure chests ready for plunder), Terrain and what wonders appear, will also drive players towards different strategies and technologies.  So, while a common complaint seems to be a lack of asymmetry, there is still quite a bit.  And not being hemmed in to a particular strategy at the start allows any player to adopt any strategy they see fit.  And indeed, a lack of symmetry is hardly necessary - look at Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization for example.  Its a superior game where each player starts the same.

If I continue to play and enjoy this I will consider the expansion, which does add assymmetrical civilizations to choose from and additional units.

Fighting? Area Control? Exploration? Tech tree? Aha! I'm in! 

Only 2 plays so far. I liked it, but I doubt it will have the potential to take over others Civs in my preferences. However, it plays and feels so different from the others that I expect CoC to peacefully coexist on my "want to play" list. 

I don't especially care for mechanisms, but in this case, let me stress that they are very good. It has -- I hate that word, but here I say it -- [b]"elegant" and easy rules[/b]. Everything seems to interlock pretty well. Also, it's a game that everyone WANTS to like simply because it has a MAP with DUDES and SHIPS on it, and you actually build cities with visible BUILDINGS.

Luck factor seems a bit high. Though I'm usually a poronent of randomness in games, [b]luck is the deciding element[/b]. Combat is cool the way it is, but the swingy event cards that target only one player can create huge frustration: Player A draws a good event - gets 2 food (effectively a technology); B draws a bad one - loses 2 food or get an angry city (takes a couple of actions to repair the damage). Nah. Not cool. Early in the game, it can make the crucial difference and knock a player out of the competition.

The social factor hasn't been too high. There was little attacking so far until the last two rounds. In addition, it's possible to trade among players. In fact, however, everyone is too busy with planning moves, so it doesn't really happen, but I expect that to change with more plays. However, just like in TtA and FFG-Civ, you'll eventually enter a phase in which everyone just does *something* with no one being capable of keeping track of what is the other are actually doing during their moves. 

More downsides:
1.) [b]The game is a bit prone to AP[/b] because of a) the many tech-induced optimization variants that make it [b]difficult to keep the overview[/b] (can be helped with the extended tech tree, see files section) and 2.) events requiring immediate resolution that in consequence [b]throw over all pre-planned actions[/b]. I can still live with the extent of AP, but it's still unnecessarily frustrating; apart from that, the down time factor is low.

2.) [b]It doesn't feel like a civ.[/b] Why? Because it doesn't feel like cultivating a growing culture. A civ should be like horticulturing - first you plant and care and all that, and then suddenly, it's all happening here. It doesn't in Clash of Cultures. CoC is an alnmost pure tactical game with small independent goals to pursue.

I've only played a few 4x games in my time, and this one wasn't as painful as I thought it would be. Everything from the movement of units to the round events to the player's actions and advancement of technologies was straight-forward and simple, much to my surprise. The only issue I would have with this game would be the chances of getting this to the table again. How often would I be able to carve out five to six hours for this civilization game? While not as terrible as I imagined, Clash of Cultures still suffers from AP and waiting around for your turn, an element that just can't be helped in a 4x game. Still, it was fun on my turn. Components and artwork get a special mention for quality!

Perhaps my favourite non-space Civ-game so far. But as this feels completely different than Sid Meier's, it won't be completely replacing it. By using the wargames' categories, I'd say the this feels a lot more tactical, whereas Sid Meier's is more strategic game.

RATING: 8
Whilst other Civ games have tried to replicate the video game, this feels the most evocative of the video game to me, keeping the essence of good boardgaming design alive. You start small, explore a little, choose growth options, grow, get resources, start building your techs, then work out how peaceful vs how warlike you're going to be based on how the map has developed and what others look like they're doing, and expand accordingly. There's a lot of interesting decisions to make each turn, but the turns are structured so that they don't seem too long, and other player's turns give you enough time to work out what you want to do on your next turn without too much downtime, so the pacing feels right. The peace vs war experience will depend on your colleagues, so you mostly get to make of the game what you want it to be. One disappointment is that the nations are homogenous ... but you are differentiated by terrain, barbarian action from event cards, your mission objectives and the techs you buy. Combat is deliciously simple. There's tension on whether building defenses are wasted actions or not, which captures the game nicely. While it kind of feels explored after one play, obviously there's a big interaction intersection to enjoy. It's Euro-y to get the game started, and then becomes trash-ier in the late game when you start pinging VPs off each other. All of which works nicely.

Everything one can expect from a good civ-game. After every turn you feel how your civilization improves no matter if it is because you explored new land, founded a city, developed new technologies or expanded your existing cities. You can trade everything and I think that political and economical negotiations with the other players were very important. Also, the rules are very intuitive. I just love it, one of my favourite games.

4 Players Only

Also the Civilisations expansion


*****Play with the following house rules:*****

For the event cards, for each 'step' of the event card draw, build a deck made up of 1 card for each player + 1 (eg 5 cards for a 4 player game). All players see the cards, and then they get one randomly when an event card is drawn. That way events are still random, but not THAT random. People sort of know what to expect and can take more calculated risks with drawing them.

For the objective cards, each player starts with 4. They keep 3 (kept secret) and make 1 public that anyone (and perhaps everyone) can achieve (put a cube on it when achieved to mark it off).

The advancement board where you get your upgrades can seem vary daunting at first and it is. This is where the game is played as you decide what upgrades you need of about 48 different ones which each combine to help you produce better, expand your city, scout, battle and a few other things. The last two turns can get very long as you try to maximize points but also remain alive. Multiple plays are needed and not for those who are impatient. It gets very difficult to track what benefits you have but for a heavy game with the right group it can be great.

By themselves, the plastic miniatures are worth the price of admission for this game.  There are 5 different plastic pieces that combined one at a time to form a fully expanded city with each piece adding a different effect.

Although there is a fair amount of complexity to the game, the rules are very well written and easy to understand.

The technology tree that each culture can advance in is pretty extensive, but all of the information is very well laid out.  Still, for those players that are new to the game, there can be severe analysis paralysis while trying to plot a path of development.

This civilization-building game feels a lot like Eclipse crossed with Sid Meier's Civilization (the board game), but I think I like this better than either.  Like Eclipse, the technology tracks are not very limiting, but definitely have a huge impact on how you develop.  Gaining victory points is fairly straightforward, and you can usually tell if someone is planning on making a move against you militarily (assuming you keep track of a few key techs).  The randomness of the dice-based warfare is somewhat mitigated by counting pips instead of having a per-die threshold.  There's a lot of points to be gained in warfare, too--Nexus Ops-style cards will give you points for meeting certain objectives (those same cards all have peaceful ways to gain the points too).  As with any game of this type, if you're on the losing end of a large conflict, it can really take you out of the game.

A solid game but not my favorite Civ game by any stretch. If I had the time/players I would choose Advanced Civ over this any time, if it's just 2 players, I would most likely choose Through the Ages. Really, this game tends to fall into the 2 hour range and really is best with 3 or 4 players. I would play this game most of the time over Sid Meirs Civ though which fits the same bill.

My only complaints about this game is that the build cost for all the city pieces is the same and that the cards kind of dictate what to do. Yes, you have 2 options with each card, but I feel like it doesn't give you enough choices since you really want those valuable 2 point cards.

At this point I'm hoping the expansion gives this game a kick in the pants. It's a good game, but not amazing.

Yet another simulation game from [person=7614][/person], this time a Civilization game. 6 years with a status phase at the end of each year, 3 rounds per year, 3 actions per round. There are no "Victory Conditions" in the game, but players receive VPs at the end of the game for a bunch of stuff they've accomplished; therefore, the game offers multiple ways to victory. Players have to taylor their research to their needs and make effective combos with them.

Heavily influenced by Advanced Civilization and Sid Meier's Civilization the Board Game, but has enough unique elements to stand on it's own. The combat, cultural influence, objectives, and action choices make for a tight and interesting system.

A good game. It precisely simulated the video game Civilization Revolution, which I consider a good thing. 

I have a few negatives, but overall the game was fun. Firstly, cultural takeover was kind of ham-fisted, and required very little resource commitment from the player that wanted to take it back. Secondly, there are so many techs that seeing what the other people had to mess with you was hugely tedious. Thirdly, combat was a generally ho-hum affair.

I wanted a great civilization game for two. CoC seems to achieve this goal - you do not feel restrained, have plenty of options.. Event cards make the game unpredictable, the fight is cruel but fun.. And the game looks very nice. On the table it is not very big, that is nice too.

Nice game, really does feel like you're building something. There's a lot of text to keep track of on the advances board, which we messed up once or twice (forgetting that you get x for doing y mostly). Needs more plays, as I felt like I should be able to do more in one game than we did actually manage to achieve.

An exceptionally balanced civilization board game that is best played without strategy purists, as dice rolling and event cards will turn them off. Negative event cards and poor dice rolling can be mostly mitigated against with proper preparation. I found nothing in the game that would make the outcome ultimately decided by luck despite incessant whining from strategy purists. In any dynamic environment tactics are just as important as strategy which makes this game an excellent combination of both.

Pros:
* A nicely designed modular board makes no two games the same.
* Modular city pieces are visually appealing and work well.
* The technology tree allows multiple paths to victory.

Cons:
* -.5 for poor component quality. The army units are the main problem, as they are poorly designed and a razor blade had to be used to clean up many of the city pieces.
* AP prone players will push the time limit of this game to six hours.
* Cardboard "wonders" do not look so wonderful. (Upgraded wonders can be otained from [url=http://www.shapeways.com/product/7XE7L3Y2W/wonders-with-big-pyramid?optionId=56051987]shapeways[/url])

An excellent civilisation game.
It has all the traditional elements: a map, a tech tree, a production engine, inter-player combat, cultural competition and wonders.
Nothing feels gimmicky - nothing like the national traits or combat system of http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-the-board-game - the features are present to make the game and demand decisions, not for arbitrary variations.
And the play time is reasonable.

One of the best Civ building games. What makes this one different is that it doesn't try to cram all of history into one game. Instead, this game just focuses on antiquity. It is a longer game with more players -- budget about 1 hour per player playing the game. Really nice components, interesting game play. Just fun.

Solid civ game. Lots of technology advances and interaction between them and game rules - quite difficult at first glance, but manageble after one play.
Military aspect of the game is very important - due to quite small map and various military technology advances no one can feel safe, regardles of location on the map.  
The only thing I'm not sure of are event cards - very random, can give advantage - but there is variant to play without them. 

Shines with expantion.

This is a marvelous civilization game, that is what I'd call medium length. Too long for a weeknight, but perfect for a full weekend night. The game has all the fixins I look for in a good civ game. An intriguing tech tree, exploration, some combat, some point optimization, some 'build your own thing off in the corner'. The game can be AP inducing at times as the game goes on as things get more complicated as you build into your tech tree. This should improve with more games, as the tech tree is the same every time. Speaking of this, the game does suffer from a lower amount of replayability than you'd expect due to the players being symmetrical. This is completely resolved by the excellent expansion, that adds nation boards, which ups the replayability without significantly increasing the rules.

The idea of building a civilisation that isn't necessarily focused on military (but can be), in combination with a map and some elements of exploration look very appealing to me. I would, however, only play this game as a solo game. So far the price tag (and the fact that it was not thought of as a solo game) has kept it off my shelves. 
Wondering now if perhaps Scythe will be able to fill this slot for me.

After two solo games (playing two-player) - Wow! what a game! Such an incredibly satisfying experience. Time flies by, the gameplay is very smooth. A LOT to discover and explore in future games. Very, very happy I got this game. 
Currently one of my absolute favourite board gaming experiences. Also plays surprisingly fast at least when solo-ing - about 1-1.5 hours so far. More games in now, so I solo either as an improvised true solo, a two-player game or a three-player game. All very satisfying experiences.

RATING: 10
The best "dudes-on-a-map" civilization game. Lots of elegant design features (e.g. tech tree, city size based on number of buildings, dual purpose objective and action cards, etc.) proving that modern designers continue to adopt best practices from earlier board games. It has many routes to victory (in contrast with civ games that have "win conditions") and is a game that is fun to play even if you don't win. I like almost everything about it, and the eventual expansion is an automatic-purchase.

I think the best comparison for Clash of Cultures is Eclipse, but whereas Eclipse is more combat-focused, Clash of Cultures is more focused on city building and development. As a result, I think players that like a 4X game with moderate player combat (as opposed to heavy player combat) and more focus on "building" will prefer Clash of Cultures, and vice-versa.

One thing I like is that it doesn't attempt to mix different eras into the gameplay (a hideous feature you'll find everywhere nowadays...).

Is this game 4x? Is it a civ builder? I don't really know the difference. The game has a lot of different possible things you an do in terms of building your civ, and it's a bit overwhelming. Be prepared to spend a LOT of time playing it, and it has the funky problem where you can build an economic engine or a war machine, and if one person is going war, it sorta forces everyone else to respond in kind, so there needs to be a social compact for things to go well. A bit too long and dry, but I could give it another shot with the right people.

Not a big fan of Civ games, but this is one of the best I've played! The best part of the game is that it's very straightforward; it's not bloated with clever yet fiddly mechanisms. The minimum that you need for a 4X game is there, with a few subtle touches to make the game a bit interesting -- one thing I don't like much about your typical Civ game is that progress is slow, and this is no exception. However, random events and objective cards add a lot of interest.

Still, I found this game a bit too long for what it is. Turns drag a bit.

This is a close race, but I really think this one is my #1 game.  It's epic, but not 8 hours.  With the expansion, you have such options to truly create a different civilization that you want to focus on.  And then you test that against the other players.  If you are about the experience and not just grinding for hours upon end, this is a must own!

Clash of Cultures was a game I kept meaning to buy.  I loved the theme and I also really liked Mr. Marcussen's Merchants and Marauders, but I kept holding off because I wasn't sure how well a longer game would go over with my family.  I finally decided to bite the bullet and buy it - and I am so glad I did.

Although it does take a while to play, it doesn't feel like it does.  We are playing 4 player and the game seems to move at a steady clip.  My wife and two sons (ages 14 and 11) all enjoy the civ building.  My wife enjoys the fact that she doesn't have to engage in full out war to win, and the boys enjoy that they can win by full out war :).

The components are top notch.  I have heard tale of the "yellow ooze" of yore, but I suppose I have a newer "no ooze included" edition as I have no problems to date.  The modular board pieces are nice and thick and the city pieces are so fun to assemble as the game goes by.  We liked it so much we picked up the expansion that adds even more city pieces - nice.

I must say I really enjoy Mr. Marcussen's games.  He really hits the theme element perfectly for me - he designs the games I would if I had any talent at that sort of thing (which sadly I don't).

RATING: 7
Revised rating down after two more plays. Just aren't seeing much nuanced interaction throughout game. In the early period, everyone seems to go for similar options. Once everyone is built-up, seems to devolve into a nuclear stare-down. Game is starting to feel kind of samey, and that's not a good sign.

=========================================================

Rating after two four-player games.

CoC hits a sweet spot for expand, explore, advance, and battle games. The map generation is straightforward but results in varied and dynamic map configurations. The growth and management of cities presents real decisions without a lot of rules overhead. 

The advances track, the heart of the game, is just varied enough and just channeled enough to offer genuinely different paths to victory. I appreciate that the competing nations start off generic, and then develop stronger and more varied characteristics as you fill up the advances track. There's a lot to explore in the synergies of the advances. One concern, however, is how easy it is to overlook conditional advance benefits once you have more than ten or so advances. 

The replayability seems strong. The two games I've played saw dramatically different development, with the second game featuring far more barbarians and far more combat than the first. I can see how the variable map configurations, in conjunction with the difference choices in advancement paths, will give each struggle a distinct flavour and challenge. Looking forward to playing CoC a lot.

RATING: 6.2
This is an extremely enjoyable and relaxing game.

The rules are easily comprehensible and will not
intimidate a new player.

The drawbacks of the game are that :

1 Similar patterns of development will occur over and over again and Much of that development is basic and almost
Automatic.

2 The technology tree is not as depthful as it  Could have been.

3 The military units are all generic infantry where there are no cavalry nor (except on the box cover) any elephants.

4 All of the cultures are generic with no distinctive individuality nor are there any roles for leaders of various qualities and character nor much flavour and individuality from special events.

Thus this is an enjoyable and lite game but is limited and without great depth.

Most decisively the game does not have high replayability with so much of
the game consisting of repeated and almost automatic choices there is a
Stale repetition that occurs where the same choices occur game after game
And the vast majority of actions are automatic and thus not interesting
Game decisions.

RATING: 9
This game is amazing. If you like the PC game, Civilization, then this really is the best board game version that I can imagine.

The game can be a little harsh, losing a city can really set a player back. But the harshness is something that really appeals to me about this game. Once you lose a game by not defending your cities, your certainly think about defense earlier in future. It seems quite common for players to run a "farmers gambit" (as we used to call it in Civ games) and not build military for most of the game. At one point, players will expand to other borders and tensions will arise. Not taking an easy chance to capture an undefended city would be silly - though I have seen the tensions raise off the board when this happens. It definitely requires a certain "type" of player to play this kind of game.

It does also take a bit of time to play. Early turns can go fairly quickly, but "Analysis Paralysis" can easily come in when you've got multiple cities and units running around the map.

When I have the right group of players together - this is definitely a game I'd suggest bringing to the table. 

It's just a pity that the expansion is so rare :(

An excellent game that is slightly blemished by plastic figures of very low quality. I decided to simply replaced the abysmal miniatures with wooden cubes, discs, and meeples for the armies, cavalry, elephants, leaders, and settlers. Despite the disappointing plastic figures, however, Clash of Cultures is one of the classic civ games. The design combines Euro style engine building with exploration, military clashes, cultural domination, and interesting card play. While it's essential not to neglect  your armies, there are other avenues to victory besides military conquest: cultural, technological, and economic advancement can also be effective as victory is based on a point system. There are original flourishes throughout the design. One of the more interesting mechanisms is how cities grow by the addition of structures, represented by miniatures that fit together around the central settlement. The quality of these city structures is a little better than the armies and settlers, although made of the same disappointing low quality plastic.

Clash of Cultures feels like a culmination of all of the good things about civ games. It's deep without  being inaccessible, epic without being super-long, and open without being overwhelming. It also happens to be one of the nicest productions that I've seen of this sort of game. If you've ever enjoyed 4x games in your life, Clash of Cultures is nearly a no-brainer. With his second design, Christian Marcussen has shown that he understands Ameritrash better than any other active designer.

RATING: 8
This feels like a "jack of all trades, master of none" civ game.  I like the way it does a lot of things, and it seems to accomplish a fair bit with relatively simple mechanics; here are the available actions, and you can do three of them each turn.  It has a sizeable technology board, though not every node is very interesting.  This doesn't sound like the most ringing endorsement of the game, yet I rate it highly because it does everything at least well-enough, and brings a few interesting mechanics; I love the "cultural takeover" in which you change segments of an opponent's city to your own colour.  I don't think I'd often shoot this game down when suggested, so I'm giving it a good rating.

One negative is that it seems to me that it's very possible to complete all of the objectives dealt to you, and also complete the one or perhaps two additional ones you can possibly gain, and this leaves players without a way to generate a substantial lead; in this way, "every game is close" isn't necessarily a good thing.  However, I suspect that this is due to the nonconfrontational playstyle that we have had when playing.

What a rush! my new favorite civ game. TtA took over the field for a number of years, but map-based civ's brought the power in the form of this little beauty, and took back the crown. 4 hours is perfect for a 4p dudes-on-a-map style civ game.

over the summer, there was a weekend where 4 of us played 16 hours of this game, and weren't bored one iota (we did keep getting rules wrong, but that's another matter). Protip: If another leader has 'the great' in their name, drop whatever you're doing to destroy their civilization. You won't regret it! Those bastards are powerful as stink! 

A fantastic blend of attacking and conquest, with managing a tech tree and developments. If a civ game fails to provide a full experience in either of those, it's going to lack, in my view. This does not lack. I've never played it without the expansion, so I've never experienced it as generic, which is probably a good thing.

A nice take on a civ game.  The tech tree is great and works really well.  The building, moving and combat are simple but clean.  The culture influence is unique an interesting.  The trading is too free form to my taste and allows bash the leader.  The hidden objectives may be to random.  Loved my first play and need a second to see how it balances out.

RATING: 7.5
A much better thought of and executed civilization game than FFG's attempt. It's elegant, streamlined and strikes a good balance between epic and tight, between luck and skill. It certainly isn't Through the Ages, being a much lighter, less complicated and brain burning beast, although there still are a lot of choices, a lot of things you want to do of which you can accomplish only a fraction and several directions in which your civilization can evolve. I don't know about the replayability - it seems that there is a more or less fixed optimal opening for first several turns, and I don't really like how the military aspect turned out - as it is, having a city conquered early in the game essentially eliminates your chances for victory and usually induces a huge retaliation campaign turning the rest of the game into a risk clone.

Will need to plan more to formulate a final opinion. Fortunately, it is fun and rather quick - easily under four hours if you know the game.

I wanted to like this more than I did, but I certainly didn't dislike it. I feel that the balance of the game makes it a real challenge to do anything other than get in the arms race. But it has a lot of really nice features, and of course great over-the-top Z-man production - slightly let down as ever by the less than first rate actual component quality. I think I would generally prefer to play either TTA or just a straight up multi player war game. Or Eclipse, which I think gets the balance better in spite of its own flaws.

Excellent Civ game. I like it far more than any other I've played including Nations. I even enjoy playing one on one solo. It plays very smoothly. So far, I find I enjoy the game more playing 4 actions per turn (as opposed to 3), 3 turns per round, for 6 rounds with the added rule that a player can't move units in each of those 4 actions in an attempt to launch a surprise attack against an opponent.

I also own the Civilizations expansion though I haven't played with it much yet. But I do anticipate permanently adding it into my base game.

I just can't help comparing it to Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game and reflecting on the bits I like better and the bits I don't. When it comes down to it, for a three hour time investment, I give the nod to Civilization. I find Clash of Cultures just a tad too fiddly, heavy on the bookkeeping and tiring remembering you advancements and entitlements. There's a lot of linked advancements you have to keep track of and plan ahead to buy. In the end it just seems like too much like work for me. There's so many interwoven advancements that your brain starts to melt. On my second game I didn't have much trouble - I'd also read the rules, which helps, but by the end of almost four hours I felt we'd have been better served playing two or three shorter games. Not worth the time investment.

I prefer the combat and different unit types in Civilization. I'm not wild about the power of the ships in Clash of Cultures, especially when boosted by Cartography and Trade Routes, and how starting position luck can determine your ability to thoroughly exploit this. The geography can really make a difference between games and how they're played.(Make a note: If you see an opportunity to break up a river by moving a unit into an undiscovered region, thus creating a better defensive position - take it... unless of course you're the one exploiting it.)

A positive for me is that the advancement board is a bit of a puzzle as you work out the interesting combinations and try different ones out game to game. On the downside I didn't find the events too bad, but on occasion they can really skew the game towards or away from a player in the early game.

The overwhelming difference between the two games is that Clash of Cultures is really about one thing - war. War and domination. If due to certain circumstances it's not then it tends to be a bit of a dull game. Advancements aren't a challenge to build, so it's just about having the right ones to assist with your goals. I like to at least pretend that Civilization provides other paths to victory. Looking at Clash of Cultures on its own for a spell I see a decent civ game, albeit one that feels a bit like work. At the end of the day though I'd rather invest my three hours of civ gaming time in Sid Meier's Civilization: The Board Game, or a third title - Civilization: Through the Ages (and that one only has a pretend board).

Together with [i]Terra Mystica[/i], one of the best civilization games of the late days. It is a 4X game in all its concept, and has a nice and simple tech tree. Developing Irrigation and maybe Storage early in the game is fundamental to avoid great loses. Perhaps its fault is that it doesn't favor direct confrontation, except perhaps with the barbarians around and at the end of a six turns game.

這遊戲是Merchants&Marauders的設計師設計的新作，支持2-4人，是一個各個玩家的文明相互爭鬥而逐漸變強的遊戲。遊戲中有所 創新，包括科技樹，可變版圖，城市管理的元素。同時遊戲的得分途徑也很多樣，包括建立城市，擴大範圍，建造奇跡，觸發事件，完成任務等等

由于有了中文貼條，遊戲的過程顯得相當順暢，文明類遊戲都有時間比較冗長的毛病，但是這款卻沒有，時間長度控制得剛剛好，讓玩家有種一氣呵成的感覺。這遊戲 雖然場面也算是比較宏大，地圖上各類元素一應俱全，但是節奏緊湊，幾個回合下來，玩家便能融入遊戲之中。我覺得是一款易學，易玩，也值得珍藏的好遊戲。

THIS IS NOT FUN!

I wanted to like this. A 2-4 player option Eclipse-style empire building game with a historical context. After numerous plays the result was a huge thumbs down.

Cons:
- Awful pieces (some actually melt!)
- Cardboard cutout wonders detract from the theme so much. 
- Cards suck the excitement out of combat
- fiddly resource management
- stagnant tech tree
- minimal player interaction
- difficult to keep track of turns because of the 3 actions. "Ok so that was my second action" "Got it" is not valid player interaction
- makes you want to play computer games
- too much time spent looking at the cards and not the board. This was easily the most frustrating part of the game. Planning attacks with handfuls of card is just a pain.
- lots of rule checking. Even if the rules make sense, there are lots of those little rules that need to be double checked. This makes the first few plays tedious. There are lots of "Ok so what happens when..." moments.

Pro
- The modular board is pretty cool

Update: Downgraded to a 1 from a 3 because of production issues with the expansion.

The pillars of Ameritrash are Adventure and Dudes-on-a-Map. In that regard, welcome to the big leagues, Christian Marcussen; the world has not seen a rookie season like Merchants & Marauders + Clash of Cultures, anointing him as the only designer outside of Corey K to dare tackle both pillars and do it well.

Reminiscent of Merchants & Marauders with 3 actions a turn and 1 being somewhat scripted (Port Action in M&M, Activate City in CoC). There is morality like in M&M (be peaceful or go to war). But instead of running your avatar around the board, you explore and found cities all over the board.

Has the exploration (pretty rare in board games) to make it a true 4X game. Like Eclipse, use the early Explores to shape your strategy. Unlike Eclipse, this game has SOUL, courtesy of the cards. Action Cards break rules, Objective Cards give short- and long-term goals, Event Cards bring dynamism. The latter can be mitigated by timing your personal progress so you tackle an Event Card when you feel ready for it.

The cool factor comes from the modular city-pieces, which look spectacular and further the theme and gameplay. Also makes the Cultural Influence implementation in this game unique (all 4X games need both a political and military element). 

Tech 'tree' isn't as overwhelming as I'd expected. Focus on the first line first, then see what opens up to you. Zoom in on the blue or yellow techs depending on what you need at the moment. Not as bad as, say, Starcraft. The nice player board with the perfectly sized cube cutouts also looks and works great, and makes it easy to track opponents' techs.

I have a soft spot for board games that remind me of video games I used to play, and this is a combination of two of my greatest time sinks as a teenager: Age of Wonders and Age of Empires II. City mood upkeep and the general idea for the former, exploration and TRADE ROUTES (never seen this in a board game before) for the latter. 

This game changed my fundamental understanding of a civ game (because it has no Upkeep).

9 is pretty conservative right now. I expect this to go to 10, after more plays or after the expansion drops with 14 civs, elephants, horses and civ-specific techs. Drool. I also want 2v2 rules. This game checks off on nearly [thread=866003]everything I want for my grail game[/thread].

Concern right now (and why it's not a perfect 5 on want-to-play) is that the player interaction seems very doggie-pile, like in Merchants & Marauders. I take yours then you take mine tit-for-tat, even worse if a 3rd player is within interference range. Will hope to mitigate this (and defend better) in future plays.

...on more plays, looks like it's more a first-attacker advantage. Just be careful, players seem to get into a vacuum with the building, then get boned before identifying the threat.

5+5

First impression is bit lower as we didn't play everything correctly. Regardless, I was not a big fan of barbarian mechanics, and was especially frustrated at how unfair events are. Event mechanics adds great variety to the game, and I usually welcomes it, but in this case some events were strictly bad that player has no control over. In a short game this is ok but in a long game with this much strategy, randomly getting screwed without ANY player control really deteriorates the game play.

Игра выдержана в базовых традициях "цивилизационных" игр. Не столько правила изобилуют легкозабываемыми нюансами, сколько сами игровые действия довольно сложно запомнить и управлять картой технологий. Конечно, с Цивилизацией от FFG, что либо сравнивать в этом жанре тяжело, но это достойный её конкурент, с опциями включающими даже такие редко реализуемые в настольных "цивилизациях" вещи, как "культуру", но в общем то все они конечно в более усеченном виде, чем у Кевина Уилсона, особенно те, что касаются боев и юнитовой составляющей.

I'm not much into civilization games, but this is certainly one of the better ones I've seen.

It *is* the computer game Civilization on a board. What happened is basically what happens every time I play civilization games: I try to be nice and peaceful and civilized, and my neighbours go and attack me. I once heard an absolutely terrific tech talk from the software developer of the Civilization AI, in which he explains that there by and large three types of players: Challenge players who want to beat the game at the highest difficulty level, sandbox players who simply enjoy watching their cities growing, and narrative players who are really role-playing their leaders (available here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJcuQQ1eWWI, starting from 00:19:40). And I'm a self-confessed sandbox player. I set Civilization to the lowest difficulty, watch my civilizations grow and prosper, and marvel at my maxed out size 25 cities. And I will typically play it with the setting in which computer enemies simply do not declare war against me. Period. And that is why I will always, always prefer playing civilization games against a computer, because the computer does not mind letting me win.

Here my first impressios:

Clash of cultures is a really entertaining and fun civilization game. I like the technology tree, with lots of choices to advance the abilities of my people. 

I is pretty easy to pick up and play the game and there's a lot of back and forth and interaction between the players. 

There are many ways to score points and i'm looking forward to play it more often.

I fear it is nearly as good as the FFG civilization game, a I will always have the hard choice which one to pick and bring to the table. 

All I can finally say is that I already love the "Clash of Cultures".

Calling this a civ-building game is a bit misleading. It's more of an empire building game set in ancient times. You can pursue an economic win or steer towards a military victory in this game. 
I really love the open-ended structure for future expansion possibilities. 
I find the tech tree a bit boring: you pretty much always choose a democratic gov't because of the free (collection) round. I DO like how the wonders and techs don't overpower the rest of the game, though.

A very fun and balanced game!

This captures the spirit of exploration, civilization and primitive warfare in a coherent, self contained design, where mechanics serve the theme very well.

[i]If You Get Past the Overwhelming Advances Board, There is a Great Game to Be Had Here![/i]

Seems solid so far. I expected something a bit less conservative from Christian Marcussen, a man who designed the wild Merchants & Marauders and cites War of the Ring and Twilight Imperium as some of his favorite games. This game is actually rather streamlined, with one army unit, one naval unit, light-card play, not-very-threatening NPCs, few events, etc.

The most robust thing about this game is the super-open "tech tree" (which is actually more like a tech field, since it is very loose and open). It actually feels a bit sandboxy for my tastes, just overwhelming you with options

The "different" cultures controlled by each player begin identically, and will only be differentiated by the techs that are researched, which will usually be influenced by what comes up from map exploration and objective cards. This feels like a negative to me in some ways I think, but I understand how it makes sense thematically (which I can tell is important to this designer, and myself as well!). Cultures form from their surroundings and circumstances. 

So this seems like a good game, but falls short of epic because the scale seems so small. Reasonable streamlined alternative to longer and fiddlier 4X games.

[hr]Enjoy it more now after I've learned to be more efficient and get the ball rolling more quickly (one of the unsatisfying things to me in early plays was that the game would end before much cool stuff happened), and appreciate the design a lot more. Christian seems to playtest well, and there are thoughtful, elegant rules in place to keep just about every "loophole" you can think of in check. Balance between different paths seems good as well, but military is a must if your opponents are threatening you, which is appropriate for such a game.

Still not really a fan of random/arbitrary missions (objectives) which I feel little attachment to. They are necessary for this game because they force you to differentiate from other players and play each game somewhat differently, but on the other hand when your objectives are stuff like "get 4 education advances" it kinda feels like you're playing against the game instead of the players when you try to complete them. Having two different objectives on each card successfully mitigates this but still feels not-my-style.

(4 Design + 4 Enjoyment)

Fantastic 4x civ game. So much to do, if you can spend the time and resources, if only it weren't for those pesky neighbors.

My one complaint about the game is that it takes such and extreme effort to move people around. So someone that invests in an attack will be suffering massive opportunity costs by not spending their effort building up their civ. Still, the reward for success is quite good, so that it almost makes up for the significant cost of loss. But then, that's what keeps people honest.

If I was a game designer this is the game I would have wished to design. Brilliant. Heavy but not too much, light but not too much. Economy, resources and combat combine in this 4X game as well as euro-ameritrash balance does.

Variable end (optional rule) makes this game less gamey and fairer. Cards (Events, Objetives and Actions) truly give this game that nice edge any game with Euro Resource Mechanics needs. Maybe not perfect but as good as they come, it deserves the 10.

2 players upwards. 4x.
A civilization game in which each player leads a civilization from a single settlement to a mighty empire. Players must explore their surroundings, build large cities, research advances and conquer those who stand in the way. The game features a modular board for players to explore, 48 distinct advances, seven mighty wonders, and loads of miniatures and cards. The winner will create a culture that will be remembered and admired for millennia.
Like Civilisation (a bit simpler than the Civ board game ) but generally better apparently (general consensus)

1 play, 2-player

An interesting take on the Civ genre. It definitely has a lot of the feel of Sid Meier's Civilization (the computer game), but of course greatly streamlined:
- the board starts out unexplored, and you gradually reveal terrain as you expand; of course, you explore a LOT faster than in the computer game!
- you still manage each of your cities individually, but only one at a time (by activating it), only 4 improvements area available, and it collects resources based on surrounding terrain spaces
- there are barbarians that pop up randomly and can attack you, but give you rewards (gold) if you conquer them
- there's a tech tree of sorts: instead of a tree, though, there are 12 or 14 groups of advances each with one tech required for entry to the group (after which you can develop any other advance in the group)
- instead of managing every single one of your units and cities, you just get 3 actions per turn
- Wonders are available to be built, but only a limited number; they come into the game when players get specific advances (max 2/player -- in a 2er game, you will at most see 4 Wonders of the 7 in the game)

Compared with Through the Ages, one of my favorite games:
- this is perhaps shorter, ending after 6 rounds, each with 3 turns, each with 3 actions/player; our first game was long, but subsequent plays should be much quicker
- this seems to have more randomness: players get a random objective card and action card at the start of the game and end of each round, and reveal event cards as their culture and happiness marker levels increase
... Objectives, worth 2VP each, have widely varying conditions. 
... Actions have widely varying powers.
... Events are quite variable, and can randomly smack you down!
- not quite as much fun for me after the first play, but this is definitely worth further exploration!

Civilization games can be hard for me to get into, mostly because I'm a big fan of civilization video games.  Board games, by comparison, can't match the variety and nuance of a video game and the ones that do a lot also carry with them a lot of fiddlyness and calculation that would normally be done for you in a video game.  Also, civilization-builder board games are typically very long, and not everyone it up for a 3+ hour board game experience.  There is something to be said for the human and tactile elements of a board game though and to that end I still try them when I can and usually enjoy myself.

All that being said I quite enjoyed this one and probably consider it my second favorite civilization board game (next to Nations which itself is a bit of a different animal).  It doesn't dodge all my usual complaints with civ board games.  There still isn't the greatest depth and variety and it takes about an hour per player to play.  But while it is still more fiddly than most games, for a civ game it's not that bad.  Sliders denote most of your resources so there aren't piles of tokens to contend with and all your technology is represented by a board with punchouts to place cubes so there is no tree of cards to wrestle with either.  It is also pretty streamlined for a civ game and that makes it a lot more accessible.

Unlike most civ games, in this one each player plays a nondescript identical nation to start out.  No special powers or unique units (which I would normally be sore about) but will be able to diverge throughout the game.  This is done through what technology they purchase (which also directs them to different styles of play, buildings to build, etc.) as well as what objective cards (one of the biggest point makers in the game) and action cards they draw.

The game is also quite colorful and charming with good production values.

In the end what Clash of Cultures is going for is to be a lighter and more accessible civilization game, which it accomplishes in the weight of the mechanics.  However it is still somewhat inaccessible with the fiddliness and length of play and while it is a fine game I'm not really after a truncated experience in my civ games.

Oh dear. Its a Civ. game, Therefore I must own it, and spend a lot of time thinking about it. I like the designers take on the Pirate game, I hope he brings something to this 

6 plays

Some super neat ways  of playing CiV - another homage to the computer game.

What I like 

Ships - they are useful, nay super powerful with both the income they provide and their ability to get round the map. Not been a feature of other games of this type. If one player has trade routes and three ships they are in an amazing position.

Cultural influence action. One of man touches that makes thematic sense.

Relatively uncluttered game space. Tech. board, and player aid are all you need in front of you.

The mechanics for the Seeding and activation of Barbarians

Simple rules, deep game play - this has the potential to be the 'Eclipse' of the civ game i.e. condense the operatic into a manageable game format

What I dislike

Being super aggressive appears quite important - the placement of barbarians, and the inability to complete goals can push you into a military route very quickly. However unlike FF's civ - you can not get a 'military' victory - you might hand victory to the player who avoids conflict/or joins in last to pick up the spoils

What really bothers me

Three actions in a turn makes for down time  - which can be considerable - with an average of one minute per action in a four player game you wait 9 minutes between turns. Add in some AP/longer turns and it can be 15 - 20 minutes. This can't be speeded up because of the event cards....

The action and event cards can combo to give  one player an amazing advantage (at the beginning of the game). Some action cards are only really useful in the mid to end game, some actions give free advances which then combo into an event which can give you...a free advance. Amazing at the beginning of the game. If these advances happen to be ones that give you stuff when you advance then you have a civilisation snowball and possibly a three or more turn head start [actually it can be as much as six actions if one player gets alll good and one all bad).  This has happened in both full games I have played and is really frustrating - combined with the players (other than the lucky action/event player)  uncovering barbarians on first two explore actions. At least in TTA the events are age specific - i.e. beneficial at the beginning, then harder. Here they can really set one player back, and not hurt another ('hey I choose Irrigation, you chose Sanitation - that's tough...').The events could have been sorted by turn - partly because they also can be redundant in the end game. 

I think the Events/actions are necessary to give interplay variability however the net result in my two games felt like lack of balance and just a bit too much luck. ( dice I dont mind as that's manageable) for an hour per person game.

I really really want to like this game but am not feeling the love after first two games. I do have very high expectations of civ games and measure them against Eclipse, TTA, Sid Meier's Civ. Clash of Cultures has a tough peer group to live up to.

Its possible that if the randomness could be toned down and the down time eliminated then I will like the game as so many of the Civ touches (the city activation effecting mood for example)are  elegant and thematic

NB - Possible variant with face up event cards could solve my problem. Also maybe an initial draft one from three of actions. The designers constructive forum responses means I will give it another go and not rate it till I am sure of my views

 
----------

After  6 plays fairly convinced there is too much luck ,for my  taste, in the draw in the cards.

-----------

7th play and feel the same that card draw so important. You have to play to the objectives and actions and it makes me feel that I am managing rather than directing my Civ.

8th play 

Too much down time, too many tiny bits of luck with cards, too tactical (for an hour per person game) - 'oh I just got an objective i could do'.....

I am playtesting this in its 'beta' version.  This is Christian Marcussen's next game after the success of Merchants and Marauders.  I have played this game a bunch over the last three weeks and I am impressed.  This is a really good civ game stuffed into 3-4 hours.  It has everything you want in a civ game, city building, culture, exploration, an ample tech tree, and combat.   The way the modular board works during exploration is pretty unique and when the board is 'built' there are actually interesting decisions. To be made.  The tech tree is massive, offering 12 categories with four advances in each category.  The city building aspect is simple and intuitive, similar to how easy it is to form a settlement.    

As cities get bigger, they can collect more resources, but if you activate a city more than once its mood changes from happy to neutral to eventually angry.  Happy cities produce more and angry cities produce almost nothing.  This mechanic encourages you to activate your city once per round but allows you to splurge and activate it multiple times.  

Overall the game is easy to pick up (for a civ game), all the mechanics seem to interlock nicely and even though they are all fairly intuitive and simple as individual pieces, as they add up it can be a little difficult to keep all the balls in the air.   I am sure that this and a few other small issues will get resolved during further playtesting.  

Overall, it kicks ass and I cannot wait until this gets released.

I've taught this to a dozen or so people and the response has been mostly overwhelmingly positive.  

***Update***  
I now have the fianl version and my rating as increased.  the few small changes that were made to the final rules and the beauty of the board and components are all great.  

Every time I bring it out, more players ask to play it.  I fear that it may get over-played as everytime I bring it to gamenight, someone wants to get it tabled.

Captures the spirit and breadth of civ-building with a built in game timer. Lots of variety. Could actually stand to be longer, but you could make it so, if you wanted. Great components, good use of the tech tree, smooth integration and treatment of culture. It's not light, but it's also not mountain-climbing.

To my mind this is the best civilization game.  I think that was debatable before the expansion, but that no longer is.  Anyway, its a wonderful game without the expansion, but the expansion makes it even better.  Just about perfect.  My only criticism is that some of the Advances (Techs) don't feel all that thematic.  Otherwise, really amazing.  Marcussen, I think is the designer to watch right now.  He has taken two swings and hit two home runs.

Yes!!!  Mr. Marcussen strikes gold again!  This is the civ game I've been waiting for all these years: one that encompasses the scope of building up a multifaceted civilization on an explorable map accompanied by great components.  Nailed it!!  The only thing that I could wish for is that it didn't suffer slightly from the same problem that seems to plague every civ game: the dominance of a military strategy (which I get around by playing on larger maps than those recommended in the rulebook in order to put a bit of real estate between players).  See my detailed review for further comments.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4.5/5  Total: 9/10

RATING: 9
Outstanding game, and a remarkable civ feeling for a game with a relative short playtime. Many threads about openings and optimal strategies, but I think the game is in fact very situational and difficult to "solve" (which is good, if I'd want to solve things, I'd buy a puzzle).

EDIT 2018/01/11: The Civ expansion makes this game a masterpiece, plain and simple. It's a real shame it's so hard to get.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played this four times with varying numbers of players. It's excellent, but man oh man, the luck in the card draws is brutal.

EDIT: After playing a fifth game with three players, revising down to a 7.0, since some Event cards literally force you to pick a player to give an advantage to (e.g. a free Settler or split up an odd number of food). This is literally *forcing* the game to have a Kingmaker problem rather than allowing the players to decide if someone will play Kingmaker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Great theme play.  Game fairly easy to learn and play.  Takes a couple of plays to get the rules down pat and develop strategies.  No specific cultures to play - all players have same technologies available.  Combat is simple but interesting due to the cards and dice mechanic.  Components are excellent - colorful mounted modular boards, plastic figures, cubes and dice, thick cardboard tokens and thick cardboard player boards with cutouts for cubes.  Artwork is average.  Game length is a bit long at 3 hours.

My new favourite Civ game. Unlike others I've played, I like all 4 X's in this. the Exploration is interesting, the Expansion, both on the map and on the tech tree is satisfying, the Exploitation builds up nicely and the Extermination is balanced nicely between risk and reward with a good resolution system. Will probably write a longer review after a couple more games.

2nd play has got me hooked on this with a recent 4 player though it is a long game. Having said that, 1 hour playing time per player is realistic and I'm now very interested to see how this plays 2 player. I do love the regularity of the objective cards which can determine your overall strategy whilst the events and the manner of the map setup (and subsequent reveal) will determine tactical play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Decent Civilization game with a few minor problems. 

Negatives: 
- The first few turns are basically scripted (increase city Mood, gather more food, research).
- The chance of getting negative Event cards forces you down a specific technology path. (Suggest playing with "You can choose to draw an event card or not" variant)
- Movement feels a little weird; units that move into a forest can move again but not attack.
- Many technological advances are boring and do nothing but make others free. Not many of the technologies actually do interesting things.
- Early cards determine the path you have to take and if future objective cards don't match up it can be difficult to complete them.
- Some cards are just over the top better than others (like stealing other cards).
- Only one type of unit makes combat fairly boring. It is fast, which is nice, but there are so few military upgrades (Steel Weapons is basically it) that it feels bland.
- Focus on ancient and classical technologies. No real advancement past the middle ages which makes the game feel limited.

Positives:
- Fairly straight forward rules.
- Relatively short play time.
- Simple combat system.
- Hidden special action cards.
- Feels like you're building up a civilization.

Overall it is good and one of the best civilization board games I've played, but it feels a bit lacking. The wonders are super big and epic and I wish there was more room to specialize and differentiate yourself from other players. Also, combat is a bit too straight forward with just 1 type of unit clashing with another. Finally, I'm not sure if the game is fully balanced. Some technological paths seem overly strong compared to others. Still, if you're looking for a good civ game this is a great start but I don't think it will replace Through the Ages for me.

RATING: 7
Inconsistent civilization game with much to commend it but with a few flaws also. Much on offer here has been seen before with the movement across a modular board in an attempt to establish settlements and acquire the resources provided by the various types of terrain. Where the game really shines however is with the advancements of technology which feels innovative and not at all linear, which is often a failing of games that have included this aspect to their gameplay. Unfortunately this area doesn't feel too balanced and there is an optimum way to develop your technology (education and science). Sadly the combat system is far from as fresh and is archaic in its randomness (objective cards with hidden battle strengths?) and I really don't understand the decision to have a stacking limit of four military units irrespective of warfare technology advancements, which makes attacks relatively easy to negate. I admire how the game has tried to move away from pure battle your way to victory strategies, and this is a satisfying game to play to a point, but overall it feels infuriatingly like a slightly missed opportunity because I think it could have been one of the greats with a little more refinement.

Quite a let-down on Essen 2012. For its hefty price tag you get miniaturised components as if it was the start of the '90s (Age of Mythology size and quality), which is nothing spectacular.

Seeing past those miniatures, you get a civilization game which is really nothing above the crowd. Start is scripted (start with Irrigation, meanwhile move your settler, get fishing, go from there) and boring.

Redeeming quality is the fact that it has objectives that are always either attained normally or through a military alternative, making go all-out on your military worth it to cash in objectives, thus discouraging turtling and the 'go for tech only'-trap so many of these games fall into.

However, if you own any decent civ-game (Sid Meier's latest incarnation springs to mind) there is absolutely no reason to get this one.

Too bad. Had high hopes for this one seeing the other comments and its rating.

Very addictive and complex game, with random set up, and multiple ways of winning that flows into near endless fun.  Winning through culture, military conquests, or just building cities are different paths to victory available to a player.

I wish there were more bonuses to defending a city other than the fortress, which can be negated easily.

I found this more accessible than either TTA or Civ: The Board Game, but I'm not sure whether the endgame would provide the same acceleration that TTA provides - because I got obliterated right at the start of Round 4, triggering an early finish.  I'd play it again to find out, though.

After one 4-playergame where one player was elminated after half of the game I'm not 100% sure about this one.
While the mechanisms and developments are clear I feel the cards add a lot of randomness to the game.
Our game went with only 2 point gaps from 1st to 2nd and 2nd to 3rd - which is the value of one fulfilled Objective. And If you're lucky you can draw some of those "auto-fulfilled".
But anyways I want to play again, which usually is a good sign.

Really like it, probably the best true civilization game I've played. Nations is great but it feels more like an optimization euro, and I don't really like Through the Ages and I haven't played the Sid Meier's game yet. Eclipse is not bad but it has some issues.

You build up your civilization, explore the map, and enhance your technologies. The only downside is that the randomness of the cards seems like it can influence the game, but I do like that each card has a military option plus a peaceful option.

Update: The game is just a little too fiddly with the rules. Even a couple of hours into my most recent game, I kept remember little edge-case rules that I would have to announce to the other players. While this is the best civilization game I've played, I would like a slightly more streamlined version to tidy up some of the outlier rules.

Sold.

This is a civ-building game with a lot of Euro appeal. That's a good thing for me. The tech tree especially feels very Euro, more so than most 4X games. There's something about the happiness mechanisms that feel a little wonky to me. 

I like the game a lot. And it's in one of my favorite genres. The problem is I don't see it getting played regularly in my play groups. So I'm happy to let others own it and play their copies when the time presents itself.

I was hugely impressed by this game. Being a fan of Civ and Age of Mythology, I am often disapointed at the inability to get great civilization building games to the table because of the 8+ hour time hit. My first play of this lasted 4.5 hours including the instructions. I can easily see 3 hour games with experienced players. 

In addition to the time advantage, I felt that the structure, rules and gameplay all went much smoother than in similar games. Most of the rules felt intuitive and were easy to remember after the first encounter. The tech tree is extremely flexible and allows relatively quick advance without runaway leaders. Battles are straightforward enough that they end relatively quickly and without too many frustating underdog surprises resulting from malicious dice.

Overall I loved this game and am excited for another play. I expect I will be purchasing this one as I think it will go over very well with close friends.

I absolutely love that the techs are right in your face the whole game, no reading small cards or staring at tiles that are on the other side of the table.

I love the simplicity of combat.  And I like the way they implemented a system to make culture a valuable thing, that was a stroke of brilliance.  "They used my architecture style, so I get the points", what a fabulous idea.

I was very luke warm on Merchants, also by Christian, but this one is a big step forward.  Looking forward to playing it with the Civilizations expansion too.  At the moment I would say it is the game Sid Civ should be.

RATING: 5.5
First Impression:
A very interesting civilization game.

The most important aspect of the game is the technology tree. It alone allows for a plethora of intriguing strategies and if combined with the choices of the other players the replayability of this game seems quite sturdy. The game also plays fairly quick after that, and I think that the decision to limit it to just the ancient era works for it, not against it, as it is more coherent. The missions really drive the game, and provide both a sense of accomplishment and a guidance to your aims.

The map is fairly bland and really exploration is completely uninteresting as a result (you might find more of the same, maybe some barbarians and the most interesting thing is the waterways.) There is the problem of the random events, but their effect is usually more interesting than deciding so I actually kinna like them.

To sum it up, this is a pretty good civilization game focused on the ancient era.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A game with a lot of moving parts. To play well one would need to thoroughly know the rules. Otherwise you run the risk of missing out on receiving the various chits which record your resources, culture, and mood.

With a good number of different actions which a player can take, there is a good amount of both tactical and strategic thinking that goes into game play. Not to mention the sometimes significant disruptions from events which will spoil the best played plans.

Overall an enjoyable play. A few fiddly rules which the players must remember, and a lot of inter related information for many actions as the game progresses into its later stages. First play of the game for us was spent referring to the rules numerous times which slowed game play. Once one is familiar with the rules the game should move at a good clip.

I am not a big fan of Civilization by Avalon Hill, and I was tired of Eclipse after only three plays. Civilization by Fantasy Flight was better, but Clash Of Cultures sure is better than any of those titles. First of all, it plays faster - turns are shorter, advancements are easier to achieve and total playing time is shorter. Secondly, the rules are very clear, I felt no need for a FAQ and the design of the game is very user-friendly (I especially like the achievements "dashboard"). And finally, the exploration phase is quick and less punishing than in Eclipse. Only drawback I can think of (if you like Civ games), is that it is pretty expensive for what you get (especially considering the low quality of the plastic pieces). Also, keep in mind that the game is quite "ameritrash-y", with brutal event cards and dicy battles. Still, looking forward to my next play!

Sid Meier's Civ series has always been one of my favorite games.  It's only detriment was insane play time and lack of face to face play.  For me, Clash of Cultures solves both of those problems.  The Civ feel, albeit more combat oriented, in an hour per player.

Can't wait to get more plays in, and with the expansion that seems to fill in all of the blanks.  I expect Clash to rise into my top 10 when I get some plays with it.

Very good mid-length Civilization game.  This is another iteration of dudes-on-a-map Civ.  The tech tree is the only particularly exceptional part of this game, as it is widely varied in effect while still having a lot of viable choice.  There's no bland technology, random availability, or few opportunities in this technology race.  No, if you want, you can get ridiculously teched up, and even if you don't, the game pushes you to do so by severely limiting the number of city activations you can manage. 

Though the technology tree is the most unique item, that doesn't mean the other stuff is bad.  Far from it.  It all works intuitively and with fluidity.  In fact, the other items are all easy enough to grasp that you can really focus on the tech tree, as well as the VP goals.  There's a little bit of [gameid=12493], a little bit of [gameid=72125], and a big helping of [gameid=77130], and the resulting mixture is truly grand.

Being a huge fanboy of Merchants & Marauders, I was stoked to try out Marcussen's new game. Also, the 4x style of game is something that I enjoy.

I think there are some fun and innovative mechanics/ideas in the game design. But for me, that unfortunately doesn't translate into a game experience that I would always recommend or want to have. For most of my gaming buddies, I decided not to recommend it because it is pretty slow. 

The combat is pretty lame. It's not supposed to be a central part of the game, but IMO it's not beefy enough. 

Also, the game isn't long enough. I totally get that the designer wanted to create a practical game experience because most people are turned off by a game that suggests a 6 hour play time. But to play a 4x style game where you want to create the ultimate civilization in the history of the world, I think more than 6 rounds of play are necessary. It feels like you have just enough time to get to the point where you can begin to unveil your grand plans and schemes to dominate the world...and then the game ends and you never get to actually do all the awesome stuff you wanted to with your units and government that you spent the whole game developing.

Having said that, I do still enjoy the game. It is a cool design and I would accept an offer to play if it was convenient. I don't think I will ever go out of my way to play it though. 

With limited time available for gaming, this one is rarely played and I would part with it readily if someone offered to take it off my hands.

Based on two plays, this is as good as Eclipse with two to four people. Definitely deserves a nine, if not a ten. I've given it a ten to help it up the rankings...

Exactly what I look for in an area control/ civilization building game. I love the tech tree. You have so many options for play style and the modular board keeps every game fresh. Spectacular game and one of my personal favorites.

Events are far too random. Too long with AP players. 1st half of the game is too solitaire and repetitive, scripted even. Good game, far better than Archipelago, but not for me. Maybe future expansion will improve the gameplay?

I really like this game, I'd like to see it hit the table more. I think what it needs is a good two-player variant...with an intelligent AI for third player. Been toying around with ideas and looking at what others have done. Only increased with addition of Civilizations.

First game of this one. There may be just a little too much going on in this game for me. There are a tremendous amount of avenues to victory. Keeping track of your board and knowing how to use everything to get her and not forgetting to use some abilities is a real challenge in this game..

Most Civilization style games have a fairly complicated resource system, clumsy combat rules full of modifiers and often fairly scripted technology trees. Clash of Cultures avoids all of these with incredibly simple rules, few modifiers and a wide open technology system that lets you build in almost anyway you want.

At first glance, it seems that all of this simplicity would be a limiting factor to the game's replayability. That might be true, if racing up the tech tree was the focus, as is the case in most Civ games. Fortunately, the game relies on an objective based system, with each player having a variety of tasks to complete to score points. That means that the tech tree is a means to an end and not the focus of the game.

The 4X factors of the game are also well implemented. The randomized modular map makes for radically different worlds each time you play and has the subtle effect of making different technologies more or less important depending on your starting surroundings. The tech tree also allows players to use ships to jump from one side of the map to the other (as in circumnavigation), which makes it very hard for anyone to turtle their way to victory.

Combat is simple, moves at a brisk pace and creates very little downtime. The same can be said for the game's turn structure as well. Players take three actions on their turn, all of which are very quick to execute, and then play moves on. It's fun, engaging and damn near flawless.

The most important thing I have to say about Clash of Cultures is that the technology tree, as simple as it is, has an astounding level of interaction built into it. It seems like 48 techs, (actually 40, as taking specific government advances closes off a few other government advances) wouldn't be enough to prevent the game from growing stale. I have seen at least twelve different playthroughs and have yet to see someone repeat their path through the game. Sure, there are a few "must haves", but the timing for acquiring them and the urgency to do so still vary from game to game. It's an outstanding piece of game design and absolutely the best conflict heavy game I have played since Dominant Species.

Officially, this is now my favorite Civilization game. It only covers the pre-gunpowder era, so it doesn't squeeze Through the Ages out of my collection. I still think Vladda's title is a genius game anyway, so the two will peacefully co-exist for the foreseeable future. I think it's getting scarce, so don't wait...go buy it now!

It is a very very very good game, looks very balanced and should be very different at every game. We just exploited one level of political dev.
I give it "10".

I really enjoyed being able to build my culture in whatever way I pleased, being able to choose the advances that best suited my play style. I really liked how your cities are limited by the number of cities, a way of abstracting out the idea of time, and I was one of the few to harvest that using military, while not annoying anyone else in the game. In addition, there are so many things that just work so neatly:

- Dividing your dice roll by 5 and then scoring that many hits instead of only hitting on 5s and 6s
- Advances unlocking other advances, buildings, and the ability to attack (you could never unlock this if you wanted to…)
- Keeping track of resources with a slider instead of chits (well, culture and happiness excluded)

While I loved it, I was also frustrated by how many choices you have at a given time, there are few limitations other than keeping your civilization happy and if you can keep them happy, it’s cheaper in the long run. I also don’t like how it encourages being nice to other players: this is not a game made to encourage aggression, it actually discourages it and tries to keep you back: even though I was the strongest militarily, I didn’t attack anyone because that wasn’t my goal and it made me nervous.

Still, there’s an excellent game here, one that very much scratches my civilization itch more than any game I’ve played so far. I’m looking forward to additional plays with this one, it was pretty great.

Build your single settlement into a mighty Empire. This is an interactive euro-trash civ game. Right in my wheel house. A perfect marriage of what I love about both archtypes. Learn upgrades along the way and manage your civilization's happiness for better worker resource productivity. Nice to have useful ways to use earned culture tokens (e.g. modify a die roll). Explore the modular board. Build wonders. Wrap around sea for ship travel. Natural disasters and aggro'd barbarians from event cards. Scarce cards makes for frustratingly good save or play decisions. Massive amount of pieces! Idea system with academy for upgradable worker units tech trees. Averaging method of combat dice with card interrupts really speeds up combat--love it. Influence system over neighboring cities. There is a sense of accomplishment as you survey all that you have built. Clever table of contents on the outside cover of the rule book. Good art and components. Those damn barbarians. It is a long game though as you would expect from all that it does which makes it hard to get to the table at this stage in our lives.

First game lessons learned:  garrison your border towns because you never know when someone will build roads and garrison your sea towns because you never know when someone will build ships.  Plus famines and plagues can really suck.  This is a very cool wide open game with lots of ways to develop your civ.  Lots of knobs to turn.

Update:  Don't play with the AP-prone!

Veers too close to a wargame for my tastes, but not a bad civilisation experience. I like the variety of advances on offer; you can't do everything and the game left me thinking about what I'd like to try next time. The rules for city happiness are novel and management of this presents an interesting problem. I wish that wonders played more of a role in the game - their abilities seemed almost irrelevant as they were just built for VPs in the endgame. It would also have been nice to have some differentiation between starting civilisations to inject a bit more flavour.

Finally a civ game I can get to the table... only 2hrs long with our 3 player games. That's huge in it's own right, but add the fact that it's a great game and plays great with 2... freakin' sweet! Game looks awesome as everyone develops their cities. Plastic minis need some help, but the sum of the parts is a home run.

Hits a lot of sweet spots for me as a Civ game.
UPDATE: Dropped in rating to 8, worried it might be getting scripted, starting to feel samey...
UPDATE: Moved it back up a 1/2 point to 8.5, had very exciting 4 plyr recently, and while the first few turns were pretty close for each player the end games were very different.
Started playing Eclipse and it trumps this game. 
Sold it.

decent civilization game with some very good design mechanics.  The research board is a wonder of over-engineering.  It plays reasonably fast for a civ game, and yet is full featured, complete with wonders, resource production, exploration and murder.

RATING: 9.2
Excellent civilisation game. A little overwhelming at first since there's a lot of information to absorb on the technology board. A game to explore over repeated plays. I look forward to playing with more than 2 players so the trading aspect of the game comes into play more often.

Civilisations pushes this game over the top and turns it into an absolutely fantastic game. 

Advantages
+ Epic feeling civilisation game in around 3-4 hours
+ Variety of strategies through technology/ Government upgrades
+ Supports agreements among players
+ Interesting cards that offer special actions and tactics in combat

Disadvantages
- First turn or two is nearly always the same before players strike out on a research path
- Lack of control over objective card draw can mean luck can play a significant role in objective scoring
- Expansion can add a few too many rules to keep track of

02/12/17: After 15 plays I'm still interested in playing this one. The Civilisation expansion adds quite a lot of extras which can overload the book keeping and decision making a bit and I have come to appreciate the value of playing the base game only from time to time.

Excellent civ building game in the tradition of Age of Renaissance and SM's Civilization.  Plays fairly quickly but could possibly become repetitive with repeated plays as I believe there could be some "key moves" depending on the strategy you take (which is partially dictated by early random events, but not entirely.)  

Special mention of the system employed for combat which minimizes the possibility of being "hosed by bad dice" which is endemic to many games in this genre.  Overall, an excellent effort and worthy follow up to Merchants and Marauders.

Juegazo de civilizaciones. Comienzas con un pequeño pueblo y puedes hacer crecer tu imperio con grandes ciudades, investigando tecnologías, tipos de gobiernos, te pueden ocurrir multitud de eventos como ataques de bárbaros o enfermedades, los ciudadanos de tus ciudades reaccionan con estados de ánimos dependiendo de si los explotas o los cuidas bien y el mapa nunca es el mismo al ser modular e ir explorando sin saber qué habrá al otro lado.

El reglamento no es demasiado complicado y el juego no se hace para nada pesado. Si tuviera que ponerle alguna pega es la falta de ilustraciones en las cartas de eventos que podrían darle más vida e identificar rápidamente que está ocurriendo pero no es más que un detalle sin importancia. Lo dicho: juegazo.

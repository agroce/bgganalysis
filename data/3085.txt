I don't believe for a second this is the most popular game in Asia as the box claims. Still, it's pretty interesting and fun. I think it would even be a great card game (as card games go) with folks who play it repeatedly. But as I have alternatives, I won't likely be playing repeatedly. And it's just too complicated to convince others to play as a fast pickup card game.

Going on the auction pile.

From the DoW Video: This looks like a nice little game and could be a nice intro into Tichu. I like that it is simple, not a partner game and has simple rules. The three suits look interesting and the fact that reds are high, greens are low seems like it would make for interesting play. It takes three to play so that is a downer for me

This was an all right game for me, but in a group I would rather play Uno... because that is what I grew up with as a lad during long fishing trips at the lake when not fishing for 10 hours a day or playing gin.  My kids also have to think waaay to long in their with all the game options, so it is a slow family game, and therefore a bit too frustrating.  Oh well.

RATING: 5
A little too simple.  Gang Of Four is a very close relative of Big Two and as such is a gambling game (as are most games which have originated in Asia).  Playing for points undermines the raw simplicity of an otherwise great, fast gambling game.

Tichu is a huge improvement.  If you're going to take away the gambling element you need to add interesting mechanisms which Tichu does in spades.

_try_before_you_buy_. Extremely weak game. Do not even think of comparing this to Tichu. I do not see big scores being a result of clever play and not lucky cards. The scoring systems takes out what little decisions you could have had to make by making it too important to get rid of your cards at every opportunity.  I love 'stupid little card games', but keep me away from this one.

Amusing trick-playing game that rewards skill and experience.  Like Canasta, it can be played with a normal deck---but I like the Days of Wonder presentation better.  This game has much less of a learning curve than Four Dragons, and is definitely more raucous.  This game is also simpler than Tichu, but I prefer that the game is stripped down to the most important goal: Go Out First!

A simple, interesting filler. The game is a little too long to really be a filler, but not complex enough to be an 'event' game.

IMHO 4-Player should be played as per the normal rules (i.e. to 100 points) but 3-Player should only be played to 50 points, this keeps the 3-Player game from bogging down and going nowhere fast.

As a game I would prefer to play [GAMEID=215], where the additional skill of partnerships is required. Gang of Four on the other hand is much better as a meaty filler.

It's an OK game, but I'm just not a big fan of climbing games.  This is almost a basic version Tichu.  If I had a choice between the two I would go with Tichu because of the partnership aspect.  This game can get really old really fast.  Try it online at daysofwonder.com before you buy.

I think the marketing may be a little overblown on this game.  It is basically a version of a game I learned in high school as 'asshole', only with a poker variant.  It's OK, it's just nothing special to me, although I was never much for trick taking games.

At first, while playing with my family, we found the game to be fairly slow and predictable - we were rarely caught with more than 7 cards, and the play choices seemed too obvious.

Then I started playing online.  While I managed not to lose a few times (I've yet to win), I haven't even won a phase!  And the experienced players are adept at emptying their hands at the most opportune times.  There's more to this game than meets the eye, and I look forward to learning some of the nuances and improving my play.

RATING: 6
Being a Tichu addict I expected this to feel watered down, but it's actually a good game in its own right. And though they were formed from the same mold, I think the feel of this game is more akin to Hearts than Tichu. The suit rankings and way the five combinations give it a tiny bit of a learning curve, but it's a great game once you learn all the ins and outs of playing each hand. The fact that the hand ends when someone goes out gives it a nice layer of tension, as well. I suspect my rating would rise with more plays, but I can't seem to convince anyone to trying this over playing yet another game of Tichu (not that that's a bad thing!)

Update: Haggis came out and wholesale replaced this for me. Between Tichu for four and Haggis for 3 and EVEN 2 (surprise!), I have no real reason to keep this around.

Based on old chinese climbing games like Zheng Shangdou. Has a deck that is altered from a standard deck of cards to make pairs, triples, straights, etc. more likely, which I like a lot. It uses Big Two's scoring mechanism, which I dislike. This in addition to the common feature of climbing games that the loser gives the winner their best card makes the game feel stagnant to me, with the most experienced playing consistantly leading.

Very fun game with some quirky play. It is very hard to get the player who wins a couple of hands early. This game is like poker with a twist. The twist is trying to get rid of all of your cards first or at least getting rid of as many of your cards as possible before someone goes out and then not getting stuck with lots of points. Cool fun party type card game. You should have this in your collection.

Gang of Four is a fun trick taking game, but I much prefer Tichu, which is very close in style. I thought this would be a sort of "Tichu-lite" that I could play with my kids, but it turned out to be difficult enough that I think I would rather just jump right to that game.

This game is a lot of fun. There is luck but it also relies on good judgement and some skill. 

The game is only hampered by the fact that it is only 3-4 players which means that as a couple we can't play alone and if we invite more than 2 people over we cannot play it either!

We have the Days of Wonder 'tuckbox' version which looks like a deck of cards (they also have one that is the same but comes in a bigger box). It doesn't look like much but it is so portable, which is a big plus for us when we go away hiking or just on road trips.

About the game:

It has poker combinations and a scoring system like hearts. In each round you want to get rid of your cards (or as many as you can) to score the lowest number of points possible. After several rounds, when someone hits a hundred points, the game is over and the person who has the lowest score wins.

You might be able to make a fantastic combination to win a trick but it might leave you with a few 'useless' cards that you can only get rid of as singles (if you're lucky enough to get the chance) so you won't win the round. If you hold onto your cards too long, you might get caught out with a hand full of cards. And if you try to win all of the early rounds you will become a target.

I will say one bad thing about it though. This game is basically a variant on a deck of cards (nothing wrong with that) but in NZ it retails at $32 NZD (currently about $27 USD) which is ridiculous. Other small games here often retail at similar prices but usually they have lots of nice card art or some other small components. These cards are fine but hardly justify the price - i just don't know where the cost is coming from (other than shipping). We were lucky enough to win this, otherwise I would never have bought it without knowing the game first.

RATING: 3
Gang of Four, like Tichu, is all about controlling the pace of the game, and that is largely based on skill moreso than in non-climbing card games. Unlike Tichu, this game is every man for himself (good for groups of 3) but unlike it, the legal card plays are different and the legal hands that are playable are different being more rigid in some ways, and less in others. 

To summarize this: in Gang of Four 5 card combinations are more dangerous to play because people can respond to a flush with a straight, and then lay a full house down on that. This is much different from Tichu, where only the exact combination type can be followed. This makes 5 card plays in Gang of Four more of a gambit. Conversely though, Gang of Four does not allow unorthodox length card plays. You cannot lay down a 6 card straight for instance, and this makes getting rid of your hand quite a bit harder in many situations.

The scoring system in this game is one problem that I've experienced while learning and teaching this game. The goal is for players to be left with no cards at all, and to score 0. The other players score points based on the number of cards that they have left in hand. The problem here is that until one gets the hang of playing hands out effectively it can take FOREVER to get to 100 points...one of the games I played lasted over 4 hours (no, I am not kidding) because we just could not play through our hands effectively. The next day we played again and were able to squeeze it out in under an hour though, so it's a temporary problem, but I do think a warning to prospective new GoF owners should go out: play to fewer points until you know what you're doing!

The other unusual aspect of GoF is the "strong get stronger" rule where the winning player is given the best card from the hand of the losing player for each hand. It feels like a slapped on solution to the otherwise potentially long game length and in one case it caused constenation on the part of one player who just didn't "get" how to play out his hand and who was perpetually having to toss the dragon, phoenix, or a 10 to another player...in reality the problem was his own play, but because of the card exchange he had a crutch to lean on, and he did...rather heavily. I'm apathetic about the rule, but strongly feel that the Tichu passing card system works better, and I see no reason why you couldn't use that in Gang of Four instead of this one.

Ultimately, I don't care for this. I don't like any of the rules that vary from Tichu (and I played this first) and I dislike the deck rank distribution, which makes bombs more likely. I would say this is a better game than Tichu if you don't have a reliable card playing group, as the "every man for himself" style of play in GoF is much more suitable than Tichu based on that game's partnership requirement...but that said, after having played Tichu, this game has zero allure to me. I dislike the way the 5 card combinations work, the fact that you can't have unorthodox combinations, and most glaringly, the graphic design of this (Days of Wonder white box edition) is terrible with big numbers which are far away from the card edges which makes it awkward to play because of the wide fan necessary to see one's cards.

This is the only climbing game that I know that seats 3, but if I had that many players I would much rather just skip the climbing games and head straight for something like Cosmic Eidex, Flaschenteufel, or any number of other games that I REALLY like at that scale.

Hard game to rate properly. Due to the nature of the game once someone gets out front they are likely to stay there. This is an intentional design element. This should give the game a 4 or less. Its simply unbalanced. However if you know this from the start and go into the game with the right attitude. Its a lot of fun and quite a bit of strategy is involved in just staying close or possibly taking the lead. Given that it is a card game luck enters into it more than I'd like but I'm still giving it a seven for the true fun it is to play.

Very similar to Karriere Poker and the Great Dalmuti.

This, in our opinion, is an awesome multiplayer set management card game. It has the clever idea that players must beat other players sets.

This game has elements of two of my favorite card games, Hearts and Poker. You play tricks, trying to dump cards, with a similar tension to Hearts in that you don't want to be left with high scoring cards at the end. The hands you can lead are like Poker hands (pairs, full house, etc.) so it is a fun challenge to see how to match up your cards to dump them in an efficient manner.

I love the Days of Wonder Gang of Four game. It was definitely a good addition to our game night, and although it took us about 2 rounds to completely figure it out, once we did, it was cut throat game playing. Definitely would recommend this for a group of people to get together and play.

RATING: 6
Excellent poker-like card game of outplaying your opponents' hands.  Asian theme with 3 colors of cards.  Goal is to run out of cards while leaving opponents with cards in their hand, which are counted as their score.  First to 100 ends the game and the lowest score wins.
Nice filler, ranks up there near 6 Takes! (6 Nimmt!).

This might be my least favorite of the good climbing games (Tichu, Haggis, Big Two, etc).  The scoring is overly convoluted, and the extra complication seems to reduce the skill of the game instead of increasing it.

With that said, it is still a good game, there are just other games in the same genre that I like better.

Without bidding to make bad hands interesting, or wild cards to make evaluating your hand interesting, this game falls way too heavily on the luck of the draw.  Just because it doesn't use a standard deck of 52 doesn't make it a good game.

RATING: 5
Good card game similar to Tichu.  It plays differently enough to dismiss thoughts of "I've played Tichu, I never need to try Gang of Four".  Ie it is worth owning and playing both games.  I'm a little worried about the scoring of Gang of Four in that the game can be over very quickly with a couple of good hands that go out quickly.  More plays will prove this out.

Finally got a 2nd and 3rd play.  It appears that my early worry is correct.  A few points here, a few points there...then whamo..someone hits the lottery with a hand sending everyone towards or over 100...game over.  Dropping rating from a 6 to a 5.

RATING: 5
A Tichu-like card game, where players play into tricks and must try to empty their hands of cards.  Tricks can be either singles, pairs, 3 of a kind, poker hands, or the dreaded Gang of Four/Five/Six (bit like Tichu bombs).  When one player is out of cards, other players score for points in hand.  Easier than Tichu, but barely scratched the surface of this one.

Lightweight card game of trying to get rid of your hand first.  I like the use of poker-type combinations.  Luck is of course a factor as far as what cards you have to work with, but there is some decision making for which combos to play and at what time to play them.  Good length for how complex it is; and the variable length is very flexible.

RATING: 9
[31 plays] I love Gang of Four.  I think this is tied with Mhing for my favorite nonstandard (not played with a regular deck) card game.  

Gang of Four is about shifting power dynamics.  It's about taking control and then knowing what to do with it.  It's about countless strategic decisions of when to go for it and when to hold back.  It's about playing the odds and sometimes getting a surprise.  It's about calculating the best way to deploy your resources.  It's about knowing when you can try to win and when it's best to just try to reduce your losses.  It's a game of merciless tactical joy.  

The Days of Wonder edition I have has abandoned any reference to the title theme in favor of pretty, vaguely Chinese design, but I really like it.  

Gang of Four becomes more fun and plays faster as the players have more experience with it.  It's definitely a game where a new player has to not mind getting killed the first few times.  The second time I ever played this, it was with other players who had also just learned the game recently.  Our game dragged on and on; we played so many hands that we filled the printed score sheet and had to start another one.  The next week we ran into the guy who had taught us the game.  "Is it always this long?" we asked.  He cracked up... and after a little more experience, we realized that the game had only been so long because we were all so incompetent.  One good player amongst us would have been able to take control and finish it quickly, but we just muddled along to low scores each hand.

Now that I have tried Tichu, I can say that (a) although I liked Tichu OK, I prefer Gang of Four; (b) I didn't think they were as similar as I expected from the way some people talk about them; and (c) I totally disagree that Gang of Four is "Tichu lite."  I find Gang of Four more elegant and less fiddly than Tichu. Tichu also has some aspects I dislike, so I continue to be amazed at the degree of widespread obsession Tichu seems able to generate, while Gang of Four is relatively overlooked.

There is a three-player variant, but I've never tried it.  Being a game for exactly four players is the main thing that holds this game back from getting more play in my world.

An inferior, but perfectly playable commercial version of Big Two (but with bombs, as in games like Dou Dizhu and Zheng Fen). It's a good game, but its existence is kind of pointless since there is a better version (Big Two) that can be played with a standard deck of playing cards.

I've rated it independently of other games. In a world without Big Two, the game is an 8, but in a world with Big Two and similar public domain games, I really can't recommend spending money on it.

It's kind of sad everyone here compares it to Tichu. People should expand their horizons and try out the original Chinese card games that these commercially released products (Tichu, Haggis, etc.) were based on. And Tichu is NOT the end-all of card games.

I love this game.  I could play it forever.  It is rather easy to learn, and the strategy is sickeningly deep.  It's crazy because you can play with great players and they can trounce you -- but playing with poor players can backfire, as well.  Beautiful cards.  It's a little expensive for just a card game, but I have actually gotten my money's worth.  Fast paced, the tide can turn quickly, there are great moments of triumph and disappointment.... AWESOME game.

Very similar to the classic game "trou de cul" often played here in Quebec, although a little better due to the novel card distribution and the allowed combinations. Costs way too much for a simple card game. Moreover, some very important issues regarding the strength of various combinations are left unanswered in the rulebook. This last issue is enough to take a whole point off the rating. I haven't tried Tichu.

Do yourself a favor, and skip this to play Tichu.  Similar in basic style and play, but in no other way.  Gang was far too random, and disproportionally punishes bad hands and overly rewards the winner of a hand.  I would not be surprised if almost every game ended with the winner being 60-70 points (out of 100) ahead ofthe winner.

No, I haven't played it, but I have played other climbing games, and I can see that the scoring for this one has issues.  The scoring greatly penalizes you for getting an unplayable hand and rewards you immensely for lucky hands, to the point that skillful play is not as important as in other climbing games.  See the comments on my geeklist about climbing games:

From that list, this is probably the climbing game I'd like to play least.

I was actually surprised how related this was to the game 'Asshole' (or Presidents). This game is simply playing higher and higher poker combos until one player runs out of cards, then scores are tallied and rounds are repeated until someone reaches 100. As such, it is repetitive. Unfortunately, this game is as random as Asshole. It's not too difficult to figure out which combos to play and when. As such, it all comes down to the cards that you were dealt. Very little strategy and skill goes into this. It is mainly a game of hoping for the best cards and hoping the other players don't have better ones!

Mechanically like Tichu lite but it plays differently. The luck factor is too high (bad cards are bad cards unlike in Tichu) and scoring system isn't one the best ones. As a great fan of Tichu I find the signicance of single cards too small in this game and also the chance of Gang of Four (aka bomb) is too high. Still it's rather nice game. But if you your group isn't against pair-games just play Tichu.

If you are comfortable with scanning a fairly large hand of cards for poker sets such as flushes and full houses, and then developing a plan based upon what your have, Gang of Four is lots of fun (folks who have little or no poker experience might find this game a little tough).

Fairly easy and streamlined rules, reasonably deep gameplay, but it's possible, through no fault of your own, to get stuck with a full, or nearly full, hand of cards when someone goes out. The scoring system is too punitive in that situation since it will effectively put you out of contention for the win. Still, the luck factor is modest over the long haul.

It's a very interesting, enjoybable game. I wish it played well with 2 or 3 players.

A nicely complex sort-of trick-taking game in which players attempt to get rid of the cards in their hand by playing into trick, which can consist of anything from single cards up to 5-card combinations. Any cards left in your hand count against you, so it's the high score that loses in this one. We always have a lot of fun with this one, and there's plenty of heckling from across the table. This is a good weekend card night game.

A fun ladder building game with a solid historical theme.  Being able to trump any buildups of card with a 'Gang of Four', is a great dynamic.

A not so good card game similar to Frank's Zoo. But the luck is much greater here. You can't play a bad hand well as it's unusual to be able to grab control and play a lead. Usually its down to luck if you can get rid of enough cards to limit your losses. But if you get the deadly split where someone has a great hand and you have a bad one you can be over jhalf way to defeat in one hand. Yet a series of 5-10 close victories will not close the gap. It's only the big defeats that really count. And these come down to the split of the cards.

The family version of Tichu. Easy to learn how to play and easy to pick up the strategy. If you're not willing to dish out $20 for a deck of cards, this game can easily be made with 3 decks of regular cards.

First played May 8th, 2007.  Yuck for three players.  I'll have to play this again with four to get a beter feel for it.  It's a quick learn, however the jury it out on how long it'll play with four.  It seemed it would take forever with 3 players.  I don't know if I would recommend it at this point.  Definately not with 3 players.  Update: ah yes, play this with 4 people, it's much more fun.  As for the time, it does seem to take a long time, however you can alway say that you'll stop in an hour or whatever time you want to set.  The trick to the game seems to be evaluating your hand and playing to it's strengths.

This is a climbing card game where you are trying to go out of cards before the other players.

Still a great game, and recommended if you like traditional style card games.

Solid card game with some very interesting interactions.  I'd rather play Mu as I prefer pure trick taking to climbing games.  However, due to this game's online version, it is more likely to see play than Mu, which I have trouble rounding up people for. 

UPDATE- Game drags horribly between equally matched players because of the scoring system.  Maybe it is just my inexperience and the problem will clear up as we get better, but when it slows down to everyone only gaining single digit points a hand, the game becomes too long for its fun value to support.

Strange game of poker mixed with trick-taking where the object is to get rid of your cards kinda like crazy eights and its ends up being a fun little game. Nice to have another non-partner trick game like Sheepshead around. A little more here than it first looks so there is room for skillful play for sure here but still a good dose of luck too. I here Tichu is better though and can't wait to try that next.

Update: Tichu is better and more fun with more to think about but note it is also a partner game and this is not

Having tried Lexio a number of times and having read the rules to this game, I was eager to try it out. My conclusion, however, is that I clearly prefer Lexio. There are things I prefer in GoF (the gang of four trumping rule and the inclusion of the four special cards; multicolor 1, 2x phoenix, and red dragon), but apart from that Lexio shines on all accounts: Playing time in Lexio is much more reasonable, I much prefer the more hazard-like payment system of Lexio, the tiles give a nicer tactile feel than the cards of GoF, and perhaps most importantly; Lexio don't have silly special rules for "last card" and changing order of play.

In short, while GoF was entertaining enough, I can't see myself playing it often with Lexio around.

7 - Good game, usually willing to play. A good card game to play with people. You can control hands, you can plan ahead, you will have fun. It won't rock your world, but I like it for a quick 'nooner' now and again.  Sometimes it can be quite fun and is always enjoyable...unless you get stuck holding a motherload of cards that is (but that's part of the game and you'll learn to avoid it).

Rip-off of the public domain Big Two. DoW stripped away the ironic mock-Maoist artwork of the original production, which was the only reason to buy a special deck in the first place. This version looks like those cheesy place-mats you get in Chinese restaurants. Three suits and doubles of each card means lots of easy combinations (Go4 is to Big2 as Canasta is to Rummy), which for me takes away the challenge. Also has too low a threshold for double-score penalty. Try also Tien Len, Zhen Shangou.

Everytime I&#039;ve played this game, there&#039;s been one or more other players who are very good at it. That made it quite a challenge to get down to 7 cards. I think if you play with only beginners (like me), everyone will be basically cooperating to all get down to 7 cards, the scores will stay quite low, and the game will take a while. But once players learn to take control--and I&#039;m starting to catch on--this game gets fast and vicious. The online version is really well done, too.

Phenomenal ladder-climbing game in which skillful play can turn just about any hand into a winner. Creativity will keep you in the game, and a little bit of card counting doesn't hurt. I haven't had a chance to try Tichu yet, but I'm curious if it could dethrone Go4 for me. One of the elements of Go4 that appeals to me is that it is NOT a partnership game.

I've played this quite a bit before under a different name.  I will admit that part of my lukewarm reception to the game is an inability to play well.

Another variant on a popular Asian trick-taking game. Simplified rules compared to Big-2 (there are only 3 suits in the deck), but more complicated scoring. Its an okay game, but why pay for it when you can play using a normal deck of cards?

UPDATE: One of the worst scoring systems in a game. Playing well consistently doesn't do anything since one bad hand can make you lose the game. Also, there is an overly huge bias towards the leader.

Climbing games may be an acquired taste? Maybe I would enjoy it more if I had more experience with this family of games. Maybe I would enjoy it less. Someone said Asian climbing games are traditionally designed as gambling games, so playing them without gambling elements may be a bit like playing Poker without betting, i.e. not very worthwhile. Scoring is a little wonky and rewards conservative play; presumably this is what a betting system would serve to balance. Odd that so many describe it as a trick-taking game when it is patently not a trick-taking game.

Fast, entertaining game with great art. Quite old concept too, coming from China. Is a nice variation on Bridge kind of card games, because of the unusual gameplay.

Played once or twice on the Days of Wonder web site. Basically Choi Dai Di (aka The Big Two, and pretty much the same thing as Golden Deuce) with a different deck. For my money, Gang/Choi/Big/Golden are all Tichu without the parts that make Tichu so awesome. Without tichus and bombs, you still get an okay card game, but it's nothing special. I like the cards, so I keep them around in the hope I can invent a cool game with them.

Very similar to Tichu. I think both games are good ones, but Tichu is still much better: Tichu's partnership-game is much challenging. GoF has some not-so-great -things: the leader has advantage compared to others, the game can end in a single round when someone has great cards - and that's annoying because you might have played 5-10 rounds before and then the single big minus-points round ends the game immediately. 
OK, then you should know also this: A) it's expensive and B) you can play it with a standard card deck: the game called 'Choh Dai Di' (rules can be found here at the boardgamegeek!). But still... I got my deck for free, so that's good thing...

This is like Tichu's younger brother, as it serves as an excellent gateway into Tichu.  I somehow like this a good deal more, whether it is simpler, streamlined or more elegant, I'm not sure.  It's also better IMO b/c you're playing for yourself whereas Tichu has partnerships (which adds another layer of difficulty).  If you like play one card game with regularity, then you'll probably like Tichu more since it's bit deeper.  I'm not a fan of one card game regularly so I much prefer Gang of 4.  

Update: Chimera is best with three.  Tichu is still at the top with "gamers".

Solid card game that has elements of several different card games (with playing cards) that I played growing up as a kid.  Scoring has nothing to do with the value on the card, its all about how many cards one has left in the hand when someone goes all out.  Penalties increase significantly with 8 or more cards left in the hand!

I prefer this game with three.  If you have four, just play Tichu.

I bought this at the same time as Tichu, as I had heard that Gang of Four heard is a good way to introduce some of the concepts from Tichu. I read the rules to Tichu first, and was a little disappointed when I read the rules to this. This is a decent game, but luck plays a big part, and Tichu is probably better. If you download the rules for this, you can play it with two Tichu decks.

Okay.  More interesting decisions than Frank's Zoo, but less interesting theme.

This is a solid, strategy-heavy card game.  We played this a ton when we first got it, but the allure faded as newer games caught our eye.  For a card game, there's a surprisingly large amount of strategy to it, which made for some very intense sessions.  Plus it makes for some epic stories when you get 99 points in the first two hands and manage fight your way back to victory.  If you like card games like Spades or Euchre, this game is a great addition.  But be warned: as the advanced gamers get better and more cutthroat, it will no longer be enjoyable for new or casual gamers.

Good trick-taking ladder style game but I prefer to play Tichu which is much more interactive and exciting.  I do however really like how the scoring works (based on the number of cards left in one's hand, points are only scored by the losers, once someone gets 100 points the person w/the lowest score wins).  I like how the person who wins the round gets the highest card from the person who lost, that is, if I'm winning.  Otherwise, this rule can really be frustrating.

A good game although I recently discovered Tichu and it is far superior to Gang. Main mechanic that annoys most people is that the loser of the last hand must give the winner of that hand their single best card on the next hand. It can be a game that is hard to come back from too. Until we get a copy of Tichu it will still get played. After that...

It's a card game that provides that familiar feel of traditional card play.  The chinese calligraphy on the cards together with the phoenix and the dragon art on a couple of cards gives it a slight elegance or flair, but it's simply another card game.

I realized I'm not into traditional or slightly traditional card games anymore.

I like the way you can arrange and play a hand in so many ways. Scoring is a bit broken because it can happen that with a crappy hand vs. excellent hand(s) you cannot do anything and get huge minuses. 

Update: I'd rather play Tichu or some other climbing game rather than Gang of Four because of scoring. Rating decreased from 7 to 6 accordingly.

Belongs to the same niche as Lost Cities: Just a traditional card game with unusual numbers of suits and ranks. Quite boring, and lots of luck of the draw issues.

We played this game once, and I really enjoyed it.  However, apparently we were so good, the person who was losing had only 17 points against him, and the total to lose the game is 99.  We had already played an hour so we stopped there.

Decent fun, but it's too simple to be special, and
there's no theme to help. Without the partnership and special card aspects of the preferred Tichu, I felt it was just too luck-bound to get more game time and traded it away.

This has been my favourite card game (with a special deck) since decades (now I have discoverd several other card games that I  like more). Easy mechanics for beginners, but a lot of strategic depth, where countering other players tactics are important. With the scoring system though one bad deal can ruin the game for anyone.

Interesting note from a reviewer to bear in mind and explain when teaching: 

"When playing with more experienced players and applying the "the weak gets weaker, the strong get stronger"-rule, it is the job of the other players to break the winning streak from the stronger player."

Based on one play: Basically a trick taking game like Tichu or Haggis (or that game we all played in school). You play sets in larger and larger value until no one can play. Then the last player to play a set, starts a new one. The first to lose all their cards wins. Simpler then Tichu or Haggis, but more luck based.

RATING: 4
Bought based on some glowing reviews I read. Played solitare to learn rules. Definately would appeal much more to folks who understand/appreciate poker (that limits my group immediately), as it hangs almost totally on this. Odd game in that you have to teach the rules to another game to play this one. Cards are attractive quality. I don't think I'll be able to hook anyone into this unless we are all stuck on vacation somewhere where this is all we have to play. That's not likely ever to happen. As of right now, I'd rather teach them bridge, San Juan, etc.

One of my favorite card games, but it can be brutal.  If you are the winner of the hand,  you get a huge advantage in the next hand.  This is a game where better strategic play can enable you to win even if your cards aren't as good as the other 3 players.

Reminds me of the drinking game we played all the time called "Presidents."  Will take forever to play all the way to 100 the first few times as the players figure out how to play, but the game can end at any time (say, after 30, 50 or 70 points).  Has gotten more fun and more tense (with bigger point penalties) after about four or five plays, so I'm keeping my hopes up...

Played this for the first time last night.  Very fun.  Took longer than expected -- play for the first few hands were relatively slow due to our inexperience in figuring out what to play and what we could play.  Made some plays that in retrospect were clear errors.  Rules were simple enough that 4 total newbies played without any rule mistakes (we think).  I'm willing to play again; it looks like there's a decent amount of strategy to this game, and with more plays under our belt it should be a quick moving game.

Another member of the climbing card family. Not as complex as Tichu, yet still provides the flexibility of what combinations to play with the usual problem of pacing. Has the rule of declaring if down to the last card, which if not heeded means you cannot win, which seems like a throwback to the last century. Also thrown in is the card exchange of the winner and the loser of the previous round, and the confusing, alternating direction of play in each round. Lacks the simplicity of the charming theme of Frank's Zoo and the risk-taking of Das Grosse.

Had to lower my rating on this one. While it is a fun game, it seems to take too long. Unless you can catch an opponent with several cards in their hand, this game will drag on forever. Also, it has a bit of a runaway leader problem. Great game mechanics, and lots of strategy, that is slightly flawed by the scoring.

I enjoy this game as an alternative to 3-player Tichu, but I can't see myself ever actually playing it when we've got four players.  The only exception perhaps being that this feels more like Hearts and is therefore a little more common to new players.  But really, if I have four players I'm going to be playing Tichu.

This cousin of Tichu is a decent game in its own right.  Interesting decisions to be made.  However, in a longer game, I don't like the "someone ends the game when the score X and lowest person at that point wins."  Especially when one bad hand can take you out of the running, it seems extra cruel.  I'll play it again, though.

(When rating games I focus on the "how likely I am to play this game again" part of the BGG description rating, as opposed to the "quality" part of the rating.)

I used to play this all of the time. I love this game. There are so many games like this (climbing games), but this was my original. I have the Game Dealers Limited version though we often played with regular playing cards instead to save my cards from wear (three suits from two decks A-10 other Ace, King, and two Queens). We even added another deck for more players and added some more types of cards (e.g., other suit, three Jacks). My favorite was the "shtank" card (we used a joker). This was the single lowest card in the deck that you could only get rid of by leading it alone. After playing this so much I disagree with many of the comments about the last card (keeps you on your toes) and the scoring (adds a press your luck risk factor if you want to wait around for the perfect move and instead encourages card play to at least dump some of your cards).

This is one of those short games that you play.  And then play again.  And then again.  Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme.  The objective is to be the first player to get rid of all the cards from your hand.  On one's turn, a player must play the same number of cards as the previous player but a higher ranked set.  Sounds simple, but there is quite a bit of strategy and the game is addictive.

I prefer the Pre-Days of Wonder edition to the one currently out. The game play is the same but the pervious edition had a political theme which seemed more in line with the game's title "Gang of Four". It had student leaders and farmers and military and Mao and such. Sure, the theme was pasted on, but it added something more than different "suited" dragons for me.  All in all a good four person card game.

RATING: 5
Mediocre climbing card game that nonsensically requires only getting down to fewer than 8 cards left in hand  rather than ridding yourself of all cards.

The scoring system severely penalizes the player for having a lot of cards left--which usually happens when they get a bad hand or someone else dealt a superb hand.  IOW, through no fault of their own.

What this means is you rarely have a difficult decision whether to play cards for fear of getting stuck with tough to play cards--play the card!.  As long as you can get down to less than 8, you did OK.

This list shows how many you score for the first card, second card, etc. (If you play your first card, you'll score -60, instead of the -80 if you played none.  Therefore, the first card you play worth 20 points to you.):
20 4 17 3 3 13 2 2 9 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

Even Great Dalmutti has far, far, far more strategy than this stinker.

Good trick taking game where the goal isn't to take the tricks inasmuch as it's to be the first one to go out. Folks with cards left are penalized, and the more you're stuck with, the larger the point multiplier will be (if you have 7 cards, you lose 7 points, but 8 cards is in another bracket and you lose 16 points). The game ends when someone has 100 points (this is the loser). The person with the lowest points wins. You play pseudo poker hands consisting of a certain number of cards, and each player must pass or play a better hand consisting of the same number of cards. Color adds another rank dimension (red beats yellow beats green). The gang of four (four of a kind) trumps everything and can be always be played. I enjoyed it. Deciding what to lead with and whether or not to give up your lead voluntarily is pretty agonizing, making for an entertaining game. I played with three players; I imagine four players leads to a little more deduction.

Gang of Four -- Played once; four-player.  Games featuring Poker-style hands don't generally impress me, but I found the limits on what could be played each hand made the options manageable.  There were only four special cards, so there weren't too many exceptions to remember.  Alternating the direction of play each hand (not each trick, mind you) did much to balance the impact (positive or negative) of fixed player order.  I found the game involving throughout, so the potential for a long game-duration was not an issue.  And I expect play will only speed up with experience.

A ladder game, meaning that you must top whatever card, set, or straight that was played before your turn with a higher valued play.  Whoever rids their hand of cards first escapes with no points AND gets the highest valued card from the biggest loser's hand in the next round.  Goes on and on until a predetermined losing score is reached.  This could be fun for awhile with the right group, and it has some opportunity for creative play (bluffing).  But, overall, the best strategy for getting rid of your cards is usually obvious.

In the same way that UNO can be addictive, Gang of Four is a must own and a fantastic way to spend time in-between heavy titles.

RATING: 6
A fun trick-taking game; sort of Tichu-light, but Tichu is much better. Here, it feels like you are very dependent on the luck of the deal. That should average out over hands, but the game already feels like it drags on too long! 

Hand strength is based on poker hands, so it's easy to learn. The alternating direction of play is a little annoying - we almost always forget to do it!

One of my group's favorite card games.  But the only advantage it has over Tichu is the ability to play with three.

The only other "progression" game I've played is Frank's Zoo and I like this one better.  It is easier to understand (at least for me) and has more depth.  I'm not any good yet but I'm looking forward to digging deeper into the strategy and timing.

RATING: 9
We've always been card players and I have to say, this is a very good game for fun and brain exercise.  Haven't played any other "climbing" games so can't compare but I'd rate this on a par with Wizard and Hearts.  It's fun, and there's strategy in the variety of ways you can play the cards in your hand.

Very nice trick taking/climbing game, that is unfortunately entirely surpassed by Tichu in every respect. I really like it, but why would I ever want to play this with four when I can play Tichu instead? As a stepping stone for Tichu to people who don't know that yet, that's why.
As for playing this with three: it just doesn't work that well.

+ 5 cards combinations beating one a another is a nice twist (you'll still be playing straight and full house most of the time)
+ Card colours is an interesting twist too, but won't matter too often

:thumbsdown: DISLIKE
- They took every bad concept from other card games (trailing player trades with leader, variable scoring, variable order of play, etc) but kept the good stuff out (betting, partnership, consistent scoring, special cards, bombs, etc.)

This is a great, trick-taking game.  I highly recommend this for a good evening of casual gameplay and strategy.  The game seems simple at first, but good gameplay lends itself to deeper strategy.  Four player is optimal and quite fun.  Three player is still good, but not quite as fun.  I especially had fun with a group of players that had been together quite a while.  The 2 on 2 or 3 on 1 dynamic makes play a lot of fun.

A mediocre climbing game: play a stronger set than the last person to stay in a round, and the last person in the round goes first. Try to get rid of your cards before everyone else.

However, the weirdly scaled scoring means "going out" is only marginally more valuable than having 5 cards leftover, so skillful play isn't a major need.

Replaced by Tichu.

Having already played Tichu, I would say that Tichu is a better, although heavier game. I missed the special cards, card passing, and partnership play. However, this game is definitely more accessible than Tichu, and can be competetently played within a few hands. My rating has gone up two points since initial rating, and could climb higher with repeated play.

I FINALLY learned this online at gangoffour.com.  It seems like beginners and experts can play it and keep seeing new strategies to improve their game.  Better than Hearts in some ways.  You sort of feel that rush of "Shooting that Moon" to some extent just about every game.

RATING: 5
Gang of Four is a card climbing game.  The object is to play all your cards and be the first one to go out.  You have to play the same number of cards as is led and you must best the previous play by playing a higher ranked set or a better color set.  There's a couple of cards that can't really be combined with anything else, but count as the highest cards when played as a single card.  And there's a little wonkiness with the direction of play alternating every round and the biggest loser trading the winner his highest card for whatever the winner wants to discard.  Scoring is based on how many cards you're stuck with when someone goes out.  A point per card unless you have a lot.  Depending on how many you have, that could be doubled, tripled or even quadrupled.  

So what do I think? It's fine.  I could see people playing this and having fun.  But there are a lot of card games that I'd rather play instead of this one.  I wouldn't be terribly upset to play this, but I wouldn't seek it out either.

Why would you pay money for this? Hearts is much deeper and more interesting and doesn't cost $20.

Only original ideas are stupid scoring and a non-standard deck distribution that makes the game less interesting/easier rather than more interesting. Oh, and built-in runaway-loser system.

I think I prefer other climbing games to this one, partly because the scoring rules for the other games make slightly more sense.  All of the games have some weird way to score points, but the ones for Tichu makes a little bit more sense than Lexio, which makes a little more sense than Gang of Four.  Otherwise, the games are all very similar.

Een simpel slagen spelletje, waarin timing erg belangrijk is.

Spelers spelen pokercombinaties uit om zo snel mogelijk hun kaarten kwijt te raken, maar kijk uit dat je niet met een paar lage kaarten blijft zitten.

One of my very favorite card games.  It is related to many other games like Lexio, The Great Dalmuti and Tichu.  This is my favorite of all of them so far.  The greatest limitation in my opinion is that it requires 4 players.  With 3 players, you still deal 4 hands and then just set one hand aside.  I don't like playing that way with 1/4 of the cards randomly out of play.

Liked my first play of the game, but found it a tad long. Of course understanding the rules takes some, but not much time, but it seemed there were a lot of hands that scored only 3-4 points. Not many when players got nailed for 18 or more. Will play more online at Days of Wonder to get a better handle on the strategies. The game IS fun though.

RATING: 6
Underneath all the problems, there's a very good game here.  The hands sizes are a bit too large to deal with both mentally and physically (16 cards).  The game can be very unsatisfying when both winning or losing.  Losing the first hand can mean hand after hand of getting killed, and winning can often mean that your opponents didn't have a chance.  It also has one of the worst runaway leader problems I've ever seen, using the same passing mechanic as Corporate Shuffle, only it isn't meant to be some stupid time waster.  Despite all of this, there is A LOT to gameplay, moreso than Tichu.  Almost nothing is automatic and it takes a while to develop the feel necessary to know what you're aiming for in the hand, when to play certain cards, etc.  The game can be terribly frustrating and luck can totally decide matches, with a bad draw taking you out of the game in hand #1.  Overall, Tichu is a better gaming experience and a better game.  However, if not for the unfavorable comparison, this would be one of the better trick-taking games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nice little Tichu-like game, with a few wrinkles. That said, the gameplay experience reminded me so much of Tichu, but without the elegance, that it competes for the same gaming niche in my book -- and in that regard, Tichu is a superior game, especially with 4 players. I'd play it, but if gaming with folks who also enjoy Tichu, Tichu would get the nod every time. With more casual card players (ahem, my in-laws) this would certainly be a better choice than Tichu, and with them (since Tichu would not be an option) this might get rated around 6 or 7...

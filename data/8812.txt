I like the CWB system, and I rather like this battle. Small, but both sides get opportunities to attack and defend, and there's a long 3-day scenario to see if you can change the initial dispositions.

Part of the CWB series and an solid covering of the battle of Stones River.  Manageable in size and time, this game offers both sides opportunities for attack and defense. A slightly lower rating due to the lower quality counters and map graphics when compared to later additions to the series.  Highly recommended.

I have played this game a few times and it definately is the best game in the CWB series for learning players. The battle itself is very interesting and might actually be one of the more balanced games in the series.

RATING: 8
This is a nice, compact CWBS game that offers plenty of maneuver room on a single map for the relatively small forces.  I suggest playing the full 4-day scenario, understanding that in practice it will not take as much time as it says in the rule book (there's no reason players will sit around for 2 days like the historical commanders did.)  The trick is to maneuver your opponent into an awkward position and then get the attack to go in before he or she can fix the problem (as you both struggle with sometimes-awkward command problems.)

The CWB system:

Wargamers love control and this game system strips a lot of that away, which feels fresh.  The written orders and the individual leaders reactions to those orders give you a different type of 'fog of war' than block wargames or card driven wargames.  The generals on the board seem to be alive and do what they do in their own sweet time.  After playing this system, reading about Civil War battles makes more sense- something good must be going on here!  Beyond the control system, I love the scale, which is zoomed in enough to allow extended lines of troops and detail of terrain.  It gives me a 'miniatures' feel with a low counter count.  I rate the Civil War Brigade Series a 10. 

This module:

I used NBPTD as an entry point to the system and think it was a good choice. Most modules have small scenarios that help get your feet wet.  This battle plays in three sections along the Union line and allows both sides to attack and defend. I really enjoyed the Union assault on Wayne's Hill.  It's a one map game, but will take several  sessions to play.

Solid game and a great simulation of the battle.  Writing orders for your units is a very cool part of the game - adds some historical flavor if done properly.  Visit the park in Murfreesboro, TN - it's well worth the trip.

Bought cheap at MMP clearout sale - $13.  

Played first scenario (Hardee's Attack on McCook) Feb 11 2006 against a long time gaming buddy - no orders phase was used.  Gameplay was straight forward and not too complicated.  I am hoping that implementing the orders phase will help make gameplay a bit more interesting.

Result was a draw, with only one Union Division Wrecked, but the required line of Union units or ZOCs not maintained.  In hindsight we both should have made better use of the extended line formations.

Overall I think that for $13   S&H this is a great intro to the CWB system.

I like series games and I like the CWB. The combat system is too dice-roll-, table-, and bookeeping- heavy and the order system has still loopholes and can be misunderstood or abused.
But this games tell a great narrative, are immersive, great on historicity and good fun if played in the right mood.

The game "suffers" from being about the American Civil War. The weaponry is scarce, and the cavalry is not very effective. Only the artillery is worth anything. The game system is fine (command system is great), but the weaponry and scenery is not interesting enough. The Napoleonic series (NBS) is a bit better. There are way better wargames out there.

RATING: 9
Still like the CWB series. Having to write rules in advance and having the situation change before you execute gives me the feel for civil war battles.
Murfreesboro is an interesting battle due to the success on the left and the failure in the center.
find the CWB series does one of the better jobs in simulating the chaos of the Civil War battle.
With its command system you do not have complete control of your forces, you must plan ahead. Expect to miss opportunities. 
The combat is bloody units have  a size component for fire and morale - how well they stay in combat.

Another issue in the CWBS this time Murfreesboro battle as the main topic. Easy title with only one map so it is perfect for people with room problems. I do not like the lack of casualties and gun ammunition tracks on the map. I do not understand why not make a little bigger map to put those tracks on. As usual in CBWS playing the whole battle can take an entire life so I advise to try first the shortest scenarios. ! always say the same: CWBS is a slow system but I always want to play it!! :)

RATING: 8.5
A great intro to the CWB series for players with limited gaming time.  Two very short scenario's make great "speedreads" of the battle.  Hardee's attack on McCook, the key of the collapse of Rosecran's right flank is two hours of sweeping attacks -- the battle in a nutshell.  Breckinridge's assault on Crittenden as January 2nd drew to a close has give-and-take lacking in the first scenario.

While Polk and Bragg are actually "upgraded" to a "1" in the game, the short scenarios (with orders in place) allow you to kick things off -- neither is going to have time to think on their feet.

I'm giving this a bonus point over what I'd otherwise rate it in recognition of its value as an introduction to CWBS. Murfreesboro is a relatively straightforward battle, so there aren't a whole lot of really exciting choices here. But given that CWBS is a fairly involved system, it's useful to have a simple, one-map game with a reasonable counter density, and this title fits that bill nicely. I don't see myself returning to this game over and over again, but I'm glad I started with it. Note that while this is technically out-of-print, there are still quite a few copies floating around out there. With just a bit of searching, you can probably find a copy for less than the cost of 3 Battles of Manassas, which would be the other strong contender for a first CWBS game.

I've played this probably 50+ times over the last 20 years and still playing it. A great monopoly style game with gambling, sex and violence. Its a beer and pretzils (luck) game but  over the years I've noted that  clever players somehow manage to get out of Shangai alive with the most money. (i.e. win) (I usually end up stuck in Shanghai trying to shoot the others)

Lot's of laughters with this game.  Cooperate with other player to beat on the leaders with special contractors.  Try to rip off as much money before and get out of shanghai before game ends.

From Ebay on 9/21/14 for $26 from John Muije, sealed copy for $26.

Interesting little negotiation game. I feel like it suffers a bit from the random element... lots of dice rolling (which really comes into play at the end of the game.)

Also, hilarously racist.

About the only good thing I can say about this is you can leave the game pretty much whenever you want to. One guy left his first game after 40 minutes. 8 Hours later, he found out he'd won the game. And life, because he'd quit 7 hours earlier...

The amount of wheeling and dealing possible in this game puts most others to shame.  The assassinations during the endgame don't bother me -- it's just another decision to make.  If wait until the last minute to leave, you don't have to worry about assassins -- just being caught by the revolution.

This game always reminded me on Monopoly with an evil twist. Been ages since I played.

RATING: 3
Another severe endgame problem - all the effort of the game is wasted by the complete randomness of the snipers at the airfield. This is a stupid rule, which wastes an otherwise moderately interesting game.

A bit of a disappointment.  Luck plays a huge factor in the course of the game and there are a few ways where a player can be totally out of the running within the first few turns.

I just loved to play it. Theme is brilliant and even game is long, there's always something going on. Just dice lessens it to 9.

Colourful and chaotic game.

The game mechanics are nothing to rave about but add nicely to what is really a cut throat negotiation game.

There is misfortune a plenty and it has a very dicey finish - only recommended for those who can laugh at their own misfortune.

GREAT GAME, IF you have the right group (fun/wild bunch of good strategy gamers that don't take getting whacked personal...hey, it's just business.) Very cutthroat. Lots to do - you cut deals with about everyone concerning about everything. 

There are 6 crime factions, representing a different nationality, in the game. Works well with 5 or 6. Basically, you begin game by building up your economic base and amassing money. You deposit money in your Swiss bank account. Usually a shooting war between the factions develops about 1/2 or 2/3rds of the way thru. Game is won by having the most money, getting a passport, getting to the airfield and leaving before the reds take over.

While waiting on the airfield, your former good fella friends may attempt to assassinate you.

It helps if everyone you play with knows the key phrases from Goodfellas, Casino, the Sopranos and the Godfather.

Beware of the opium den ;-)

Game takes about 4 hours, a fair amount of vodka, red bull, cigars and whatnot. Oh, and usually no one wins.... you all die at the airfield.

Truly a game where you don't care who wins and only remember the nasty backstabs.

One of those great "cult items" that I played a lot years ago and always wanted to get.  Well, i just picked it up in a flea market, so we shall see if it rekindles the old spirit.  I'm rating this a 6 from older play sessions and perhaps nostalgia.

RATING: 8
Just thinking about this game makes me giggle. Chris F.'s point is quite valid and even though I usually hate random endings to games, this one just doesn't bother me. It's a matter of the group I play with - a bunch of grognards who occassionally like to bring out Shanghai and shoot some coolies. We don't take it very seriously at all. We barely even take note of who wins.  If I were to play this with other gamers, it would rate much lower.

RATING: 7
If you can live with the possibility of being assassinated while escaping Shanghai at the end of the game (and thus losing) this is a great game for negotiation, double-dealing and back stabbing.

VPI! Very Politically Incorrect -- and funny as hell. Clunky game mechanics and a pure joy to play with the right group. We've had this forever, and will keep it forever. One of the best Old Skool games we've ever played.

RATING: 5.5
A really neat game of backstabbing in colonial Shanghai just before the Japanese invaded. If you like games focused on exacting as much possible benefit from the other players through extortion and threats, while gambling and pushing your luck on making enough money before you leave town... then this might be for you. Definitely some old style dice rolling mechanics, and very mean, but the theme comes through. Most people I play with these days aren't into these games... so I sold it on to someone else who could enjoy it.

RATING: 4
Interesting game, combining lots of dice rolling, negotiation, back stabbing and general illicit activity.

Probably the worst board art and design I've ever seen. It doesn't kill the game experience, but it certainly doesn't help it either.

Not a good choice for people who don't like betrayal and back stabbing - because this game is full of it.

For me, the game didn't click. For what it is, the game just seems too long (around four hours).

Incredibly vicious, thematic, hilarious fun, but with a couple of real concerns: 

1) too much rides on die rolls too often (indeed, there is a psuedo roll & move mechanic we houseruled after the first year) 

2) Significantly and openly racist imagery in the game art.

I can deal with the first, but the second left a bad taste in my mouth, else the rating would be higher. I want to like this game more, but the racism really bothers me.

RATING: 3
A reasonably clever reworking of the Monopoly game system with some extra features to spice it up (eg assassinations). The main thing that really puts me off this game is that you can spend almost 2 hours building up a nice pile of cash and then, when you try to leave Shanghai, lose due to a lucky opponent's single dice roll! Why bother!

Played many years ago when there were not nearly as many good options - but even then it suffered in comparison to Junta. There is a large luck factor, and winners are generally those who avoid becoming victims of other players. Not a bad game with the right people, but not to my taste. Works for rowdy uni students :)

I spent many an hour playing this game as a student. A solid enjoyable game that worked well as long as one doesn't get too caught up in the contest. Yes the end game can be a frustrating experience, but the journey to get there is what makes the game. Our games usually featured the obligatory Tintin and the Blue Lotus references throughout the session.

Wow! just got this game second hand but in mint condition. I'm interested in the background period and it certainly gives a flavour of that. Its an all out brutal play - screwing over each other from start to finish and the endgame is tense and grim! One trapped at the airport by the Red Guards, one missed that last plane, one shot dead mysteriously (by me!) and only one got out to spend his money! You don't even have to control that much of Shanghai to do well, I only had the currency trader and a factory pyramid and spent the rest of the time messing up other peoples' empires and I made pretty much the most money....but I didn't get out! Marvellous fun, a great game on a great topic, the political incorrectness makes it even better!JUST PLAYED AGAIN AND UPPED MY RATING!!!!!

Must be played with the right people - preferably nasty, vindictive friends who can also have a laugh if they're shot on the tarmac while stepping on a plane to freedom. With 5-6, too long for a game that involves rolling dice to successfully move. With 3, not interesting enough. The fun is in extortion and threats, but it does drag.

It's fun, but a little long. I've got some tournament rules that I want to try out that are supposed to shorten the play time by about an hour at least. If I can get a five or six player game of this done in about three hours, it'll be a solid seven.

RATING: 5.5
This game seems to oscillate between very fun and tedious. The mechanics ensure some level of antagonism to/from all players, which may or may not go over well, depending on who's playing. 

The theme is simple (though slightly inappropriate), with the real fun coming from the player interactions and faction bonuses. 

All in all, it's a decent game, but a perfectly-played game can be completely derailed by complete random endgame chance.

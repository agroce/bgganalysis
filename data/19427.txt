We played Blokus Trigon almost to death, so Gemblo has revived the abstract genre for us. It is also great that the game supports 5 and 6 players, although the setup for 5 players is cumbersome.

RATING: 6
1 play / 5 players

simple concept of laying awkward tiles down. interesting but fierce competition for space. occasionally valid gem connections were difficult to perceive, and occasionally you could slide an odd shape into a great position. I don't think I'd like it as much with less people.

This replaces blockus as it supports 2,3,4 or 6. The pieces are better as well. The only down side is that the box is a stupid huge hexagon.

My rating after a single play.  For a two player game I'd prefer Blokus Duo but for any other number of player Gemblo may be better.  It doesn't feel that you can be nearly as aggressive with blocking but the Hex board makes it a very interesting game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good, short & abstract game with simple rules. The hexagons offer more placing possibilities than squares in Blokus. Best with 2-4 players, with 6 it's too easy to block one player and starting player has too much advantage.

{2 plays - 3 player} It all works, but I prefer Blokus... even though both this and Blokus aren't really my cup of thinking.  The difference for me is that Blokus feels more clever when you "break through" what looks like a blocked situation.  I give GemBlo props, though, for accomodating 2-6 players in a balanced fashion.

I really liked the blokus games and this is more of the same but with hexs and slightly different placement rules.

Comparisons to Blokus are inevitable but, despite the aparent similarties, this feels a bit different; looser I think.  Which, for me, is a good thing and edges it over Blokus.  The fit of the shapes to the spaces on the board is harder to see, though, initially at least - practice seems to help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Huge similarity between Gemblo and the mainstream game of Blokus.  Try to get your pieces placed on the board, while blocking the other players' abilities to do the same.

The difference here is that you're working with hex-based pieces instead of squares, so the placements can be a little harder to envision.  Otherwise, it's all the same idea!

I enjoy this one just a tad more due to the slightly higher difficulty, and the pieces are beautiful to boot!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's like crappier Blokus. The great thing about Blokus is the simplicity of the rules - you can teach anyone to play in seconds. The rules for placement here are not as easy, and it doesn't feel any more fun as a result.

The ONLY thing this game has over Blokus is the three player rules work well. But I'd probably just go to any other three player game instead. Meh.

RATING: 6.5
Excellent and wonderful.  Suffers slightly in comparison to Blokus solely for being both a little harder to visualise and being lighter on the screwage. Screwage often requires cooperation among players to work effectively due to the placement rules.  For the same reasons the game also ends rather faster than is often expected.  When played with the expansion an my variant rules: Rating: 8.5.  When played by itself, rating: 7.5.  When played with the expansion and its rules, rating: 6.

RATING: N/A
I love, love, love:
- the quality components (we have the Korean Gemblo Deluxe)
- the simple but tactical puzzle
- that it scales up to 6 players very well!
- that the game doesn't overstay its welcome and often gets replayed two or three more times in one session
- that there's a "solo" challenge of making the images in the booklet--my husband and I work on them together and still haven't yet figured out all of them
- that it's a change of pace from the usual Euro games we play
- that it's fun to play with people of all ages
- that the board is huge and so pretty to look at before and at the end of every game

I dislike:
- that the box doesn't neatly fit into our little board game "closet" area due to its unusual and large size

Final verdict: Great game, and the deluxe version is so worth it. Never leaving our collection.

Interesting game, very similar to blokus but different at the same time. 

The bridge mechanic for piece placement is less intuitive than the connect at corners of blokus, but once you understand exactly how this works I think there is more scope for piece placement.

I like that you could play with up to 6 players but I doubt I would ever choose to. Also the white pieces will be very hard to play on the clear board.

It seems natural to compare this to Blokus, so that's what I'm going to do. 

It seems a bit harder to teach. The "must be separated by a hexside that doesn't pass through a tile" is harder to grasp than "must touch on a corner." It's not that much more complex, but enough that I could see it being an issue with the kind of casual gamers I normally play these kinds of games with.

It seems like its strong suit will be with multiple players (I've only played it 2 player so far), so I will try to do so and re-evaluate it at that point. For now I like it, but it won't replace Travel Blokus for me as a two player game.

Compared to Blokus, GemBlo has more to do with expanding your spidery reach and less to do with snuffing out the other players.  I think I like that.  How many thoughtful six-player games are there that look fantastic, can be taught in a minute or two, and play in 30 or 40 minutes?  Very few, if any.  That's a good reason to own GemBlo, even for those who already have a copy of Blokus.  The hexagonal board has the added advantage of scaling symmetrically for three or four players, although five won't work.

Fun and fantastic looking game that is a nice expansion of the idea behind Blokus. I might buy that this wasn't inspired by Blokus if it weren't named GemBlo. The fact that you aren't in a 90 degree corner at start like in Blokus helps the game tremendously.

[Initial Impression: 8]
An absolutely stunning game visually (and it has purple pieces!), Gemblo plays very similarly to Blokus.  I prefer it to that game, however, because 1) Gemblo scales well from 3-6 people (I don't know about 2 yet), and 2) you are allowed to play off of any node (not just corners), so each piece allows more connecting plays.  This latter point makes it even more challenging to effectively block your opponents, raising the tension between deciding to keep others from encroaching on your territory or to try to expand your reach.  It has expansion cards that may spice up play a bit, although I haven't used them yet.  It is unfortunate that this lovely and compelling game is so expensive.

Similar to Blokus, but can accommodate up to six players. Quick and fun to play abstract filler, if you don't take it too seriously. Can be fun like "chess is fun" if you let AP take over. Had to keep telling myself not to pop one of these pieces in my mouth--they all look like gorgeous hard candy...

Update (06/13/09): Tried the 2P game, but the rules are frustratingly vague. It sort of said: "Play it anyway you want to, using two pieces each." What does that mean?!? The boundaries, which change depending on the number of players, needs to be more clearly delineated--the symbols in each hex is confusing at best.

Why play Blokus when you can play Gemblo? 

Can comfortably accommodate 3, 4, 6 players. Can awkwardly do 5. The last player disadvantage is HUGE; if 6th player gets 2nd place that is like a victory in itself. But the game is so pretty and short enough that I forgive this.

Yea, it's a Blokus clone.  Yes, I realize you can place a little further away.  And I know that it can play 6 players nicely.

Still, I think the biggest thing going for this game is just how damn pretty it is.  I mean, it's just an awesome looking game!

Still, I'd never actually *want* to play with 6 players.  So we'll see if I keep it around along side Blokus Trigon.

A lot busier than Blokus and a little hard to get used to the new movement requirements but it plays with six and is enjoyable. The girls in my group love the shiny jewels.

If you're only playing with 4 or 2 people I'd recommend Blokus or Travel Blokus instead as they are easier to figure out. If you're a Blokus fan and want to play with more people, this game is great.

It's 6-player Blokus.  If you have Blokus there's no reason to get Gemblo unless you want to play with 6.  If you have Gemblo there's no reason to get Blokus.  They're both very enjoyable though, so pick your favorite shape, squares or hexagons.

Seems it's much more difficult to plan here as precisely as in Blokus.  That's why I liked it less.  On the other hand I'll gladly play to more to make sure it's correct conclusion.  If it's not, my rating is likely to go up.

Undisputable advantage of Gemblo is the number of allowed players (3 is viable as well as 5 and 6).

This is a somewhat clever "Blokus" on hexes. The board is kind of difficult to see. I prefer the Blokus method of touching corners rather than the place along the spline method here, since it is more intuitive in Blokus. This is pretty good, but just isn't as clean as Blokus and therefore is a notch lower.

This is basically "hexagonal Blokus" with up to six players.  Very interesting and you'll probably like it if you like Blokus.  I'm not sure if six players is fair when matched with all experienced GemBlo players, since going sixth might really stink...

Very good game, just not my thing, although I do think the board looks way pretty while you're playing.  I'm just not good at seeing the connections in spatial games like this--maybe it's a girl thing, or maybe it's just a Janna thing.  I wouldn't refuse a game of Gemblo, but just like Blokus, it's not something I'm going to ask to play.

Light abstract. An attractive variation of Blokus for up to 6 players. Pieces are hexagonal, rather than square, so rules for placement are somewhat different.  Colorful, translucent, gem-like pieces create a work of art by the time the game board is full.

Superficially similar to Blokus, but the hexagonal shapes are harder for many people to mentally grasp. Thus, the game has more of a puzzle-feel since it is not as easy to see which pieces fit in which spots. While I like puzzles, I find that they're often unbalanced between players of different abilities. Hence, I prefer Blokus, but would like to play this game again.

OK, I just don't know what y'all are thinking here. For starters the rules are horrible, and it's not just a translation issue - you have to for example say what the rules are before giving an example. Sure, we've played Blokus and so we should be able to figure this out, but really just barely. I don't find the game plays as well either: you can't block as effectively as in Blokus, and with two players, Gemblo suffers from the same awkward each-player-pretends-they're-two-players non-solution that Travel Blokus got around. Yeah, great, you could play this with six, which you can't do with Blokus. Doesn't mean you should.

The good: whatever plastic they used, the pieces chime beautifully when they touch.  

The bad (after a 2-player game): lack of control, and little interaction.  In the early stages - it's impossible to block the opponent, so early moves are pretty much pointless.  In the midgame, you can set aside pieces that you're guaranteed to be able to pay later.  In the late game, you're just playing those pieces.  

If I played a 4 partnership game, or a 6p game, my rating may go up, since blocking (of some players) is now possible; however, most abstracts sufferer from petty diplomacy and who-sits-next-to-the-weakest-player issues in multiplayer, so I'm not holding my breath.

First impression: It's very closely related to Blokus but plays better with bigger range of players (supports 2-4 + 6 players).

Nice change of pace from Blokus! I really like the deluxe version of this game because of the nice diamond-like playing pieces and the golden board. I also really like the diverse selection of shapes Gemblo has as opposed to Blokus. There seems to be a lot of strategy in getting your pieces placed, I would say much more so than in Blokus. The fact that the board is a grid of hexagons also makes for more of a challenge than Blokus' square grid.

I like the tile placement rules of this game, you get to place a lot less then other game sof the sort, thus initial decisions are more important, as our tile selection. Pieces must be able to link, but through an empty space and thus blocking by the opponent is more clearly defined. Looking forward to another play.

Love the game, love the pieces.  If your going to get one go for the "full" version and skip the "gemblo light" version.

Fine Blokus-esque game. Basically the same rules as Blokus but with a different definition of what a legal placement is.

But I am not fond of the optional/advanced secret random special action cards. They add luck and hidden info and silly chaos to what (seems to me) should be a pure elegant abstract strategy game.

I own Gemblo Light.   I much prefer this to Blokus as the hex shape gems are simply more appealing.  Im not particularly good at this kind of game, but I do enjoy trying to better my scores.  There are some really tricky moves you can pull off.

Yes this is basically 6-player Blokus.  The moves are a little harder to see as the board fills up, and it takes a while to get used to how some of the pieces fit onto the board (there's a lot of wishful thinking attempted placements).  But if you like Blokus, you'll undoubtably like this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Comparisons to Blokus are not unwarranted, however GemBlo supports six players compared to Blokus' four. Try to place as many of your Tetris-shaped pieces as you can on an increasingly shrinking board. Your pieces may not "touch" each other, and each new piece placed must be "one edge away" from a previously played piece of yours. Each piece you can't fit costs you points based on its size, so get out the big stuff first. Lowest score wins. A nice filler and warm up game. Easy to teach, as long as you can get the "one edge away" concept to click.

Blokus with flexibility. You have more options for moves and you can play with more players. Less cut-throat as you can't block as easily earlier in the game. Official 5-player rules are available, as is a smaller version of the game (Gemblo Light).

A pretty good game... like Blokus with hexes, though since you're not playing directly on a corner as you are in Blokus, I think there are greater opportunities to playoff of each piece.  Enjoyable, and I understand it will play up to six.

Prettier than Blokus but harder to see what's legal to play, and harder to quickly see legal playing spaces if less than 6 are playing. The board is also way too big, though. The smaller board - GemBlo Light - is much more reasonably sized but unfortunately the pieces are not nearly as attractive as the original (these are more like the Blokus pieces).

This game works great with three, four or six players and is very non-gamer friendly. And pretty, too!! I was disappointed by the board, though. With such pretty pieces, a prettier board would make it a showpiece. But I suppose it is expensive enough as it is. I got it before the smaller version was available (which I also have not seen). Blokus on steroids.

[Dagoy 2005 Deluxe edition] {Abstract; connection; scalable} Gemblo is an attractive family abstract game. It's not a conceptual game; players can visualize the situation and plan their actions accordingly. It has nice player interaction and is fast-paced. It's fun but there are down time between turns; esp. when more players are involved.

The bits are pretty and sturdy. The board can hold the game pieces firmly.  However, it's over-produced and over-priced.  [Update] Ok, I am so glad I got the old (deluxe) edition. The new (cost friendly) edition is too ugly comparatively.  I will no longer complain it's over-priced or over-produced.

In the same vein as Blokus, but slightly different. Will play more than 4 players. Is it worth getting just for that - depends on how much you like this type of game. It is pretty good sized, so I'd only recommend this if you have 5+ players who love this type of game.

I didn't enjoy this as much as Blokus because the rule of playing off the corner of one of your own pieces makes much more visual sense in Blokus with square pieces than it does in GemBlo with hexagonal pieces.  I might be able to handle GemBlo if I played it a few more times, but Blokus certainly scratches the same itch as GemBlo and is significantly cheaper, so I definitely don't feel the need to own GemBlo.  If you're a huge Blokus fan than I certainly recommend checking this game out, but if not then you can pass this up.

RATING: 7
(2 plays) A very nice abstract, once you get back the impenetrably-written rules. It has a very interesting dynamic where 2 players can cooperate to wall off an area, which they then have an incentive to later compete over in order to get a lion's share -- versus trying to compete out in the mass with everyone else. Unfortunately, people with poor spatial sense can take a long time on their turns. Note that it doesn't accomodate 5!

RATING: 6.5
[thing=19427][/thing] is an abstract game in the same vein of that of [thing=2453][/thing] and has a feel, for me, someone that doesn't play much abstracts, of [thing=9674][/thing].

In the game everyone has the same pieces, of various sizes and shapes (going from 1 to 5 hexagons). The goal is to put as many of them as possible on the board. There are only two rules for placement:
a) it must be exactly at 1 line of distance to one of your other piece;
b) it can't touch one of your other pieces on the board. It is allowed to touch other players pieces.

As in [thing=9674][/thing] a bigger or smaller area of the board is used depending on the number of players. The winner will be the player with least value in pieces the bigger and weirder, the costlier it will be) when no one can add another piece to the board.

There is all there is to [thing=19427][/thing]. No randomness, no luck, perfect information. It requires spatial intelligence in order to do well, and there is also room for strategy, as is possible to set up later plays by adding pieces in a way that the others are blocked (do to not being able to add a piece without touching another piece of them) but you will be free to put pieces.

Gameplay is smart and really easy to teach (as only abstracts can be) and to play, though playing well is another matter, still the learning curve is soft, this isn't [thing=171][/thing] or [thing=188][/thing], nor even [thing=9674][/thing], which is much deeper with its scoring. Definitely a game that kids can play near or above the level of that of adults.

The bits of the pieces are translucent, colored pieces, and look great on the board. By cheer colourfulness it can grab the attention of passers. The board, by contrast, is made of boring gray, and the plastic of it seems flimsy.

Anyway, [thing=19427][/thing] is a game with not very hard decisions, one that can accommodate up to 6 players, but the downtime, while players are trying several options, considering this or that piece, made me think this number won't be the greatest idea - however, the point of view on BGG is different, so probably I'm not correct in this.

Since I much rather play thematic luckfest dice-chuking games, [thing=19427][/thing] isn't the perfect fit for me. Still, I would definitely be willing to play it occasionaly, as a light, quick, tension-free kind of game.

Has become my favorite area filling game in the Blokus category.  I like the hex feel of the game, and the way the pieces connect without attachment that allows other pieces to squeeze through. It is real eye candy, and always attracts viewers who never saw the game before. Plus, it's hard to win. Getting rid of your biggest pieces first doesn't always work!

I like this game. I am not into abstracts, but this game really does shine. I have played Blokus before but the shapes here are more challenging and not as easy to spot and fit on the board. This leads to more tension and also to the joy of finding an extra piece to squeeze onto the board. With Blokus, it can become a little dry and the shapes are significantly easier to spot. After 3 plays, it is still tough for me to align all the pieces properly. Plus, this games scales up to 6, which is a plus.

Blokus with hexagons, GemBlo gives you a Blokus fix, even with three, five or six players.  The odd mechanics of how a hex-based Blokus-style game works make it very intriguing.  May lead to fewer plays of standard Blokus.  My GemBlo Light edition is also easier to take places.

(1.12 - after 1 4p game)   This is a Blokus like game with a much more limited release.   The pieces are hexes rather than squares and you leave a 1 space gap rather than immediately diagonal in Blokus.  Very colorful, plays best with 4 or even 6!!!!!.

This will hit the table more often in 2012.

RATING: N/A
Oooh, pretty! abstract strategy game with transparent, colored pieces, each of which is made up of one to five hexagons. Each player has an identical set of pieces in a unique color. The goal is to get rid of all of your pieces. Pieces may not touch previously-played pieces of the same color at all; instead each piece must be a distance "1" from another piece of the same color, where 1 is the length of a side of one of the small hexagons. Supports up to 6 players. In the two-player version, each player takes two colors.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's very similar to the Blokus family of games, but the use of hexagons over squares and triangles makes the game different enough, design-wise, but not for me to feel like I need to go out and buy it.  It's not as intuitive, but I can see it being a good family game, especially since it plays up to six.  Also, this is strictly a 6-player game, as the one time I played it with fewer players, everyone but two players were able to end the game with all their pieces on the board, placing their 1-piece piece to the board last.  It was too loose, though it didn't lack in tension and angst.  It sure is a purty game, though!

1 play: 5 players
2 plays: 6 players

RATING: 8.4
I like that the scoring takes care of itself. I use the suggested modified scoring, where you merely count the unused hexagons at the end. Though, it would seem that there is a disadvantage to playing after others, no one really minds.

I enjoyed the 6-player game of Gemblo I partook in, even though it was somewhat chaotic.

After 1 Play: I've never played Blokus so I can't compare, but I liked this game.  Orienting pieces in your mind is fairly difficult with hexagons, so you get to be entertained as your opponent tries in vain to fit a piece where it just won't fit.

--I've now played all the blokus games, but alas it's been so long since playing Gemblo that I still can't compare them.

RATING: 6.5
The goal of the game is to amass the most jems before the end of the game, which is signalled by the arrival of the grey pirate ships.  Each turn, a player has to purchase an island, and then may optionally raid the pirates treasure chest using sabres (there are two currencies, money and sabres).  Then the player moves one of the island cards over to the pirates area.

There are a few ways to score gems: 1) collect different colour of islands, obtain islands that pay out gems directly, and score the majority in a particular colour of island cards.  The dilemma is that when you get more than one of the same colour card (island card) you get paid for each and every symbol on ALL of the cards (this can include money, sabres, and gems).  However, you want to get different types of colours for greater long-term scoring opportunities. Gameplay is simple but fairly enjoyable, and it seems to scale fairly well from 2-5 players.  Surprisingly, although this is a fairly new game, it is out of print and almost impossible to find.  One of my wife's favourites.

RATING: 5
If I had to name a game in which you do not plan so much ahead and just live the very situation at the hand, One-eye would tick the box. You spend money to buy points while fighting for the majority in a few categories. Evaluating the value of each card is quite straightforward and so is the whole game. No surprises nor very agonizing trade-offs. If you have to think, it is basically guesswork about which majority to fight for, i.e. which cards would you top deck.

Playable but nothing special.

RATING: 7
Simple...sounds like a kids game, but the decisions were refreshingly complex.  The mechanic is additive benefits: you get the benefit of your new card and all others you previously collected in the same color.  A keeper...even if the box is bigger than it needs to be.

A fine little "engine building" game.  In some superficial ways it makes me think of a cross between Glen More and Space Beans - collecting things by colour, taking them away from opponents who might be collecting that colour too, and then activating them when you pick something of the same colour.

Quite a clever set collection game. The income mechanics are well thought out and original but have a distinct rich get richer flavour to them. The actual choices you have during the game are very luck dependant. The game is over too quick for the luck to even out. Still a fun light filler.

RATING: 3
I can see where it might be an amusing game if the random card draw goes such that players have access to resources equally in the beginning, but if this doesn't happen, and a player gets locked out of cutlass cards early in the game, they lose.  Period.  Their opponents will take two cards each turn while they only get one and their opponents will lock up cards they need (cutlass cards) by putting them on the table...where they can't get them because they never get any cutlasses!

Simple, yet very funny game of set collection.  Players collect color set of cards where each cards give resources which help to get more cards (money, swords) or which give victory points (chests, jewels).  Played it once with 5 players and enjoyed it very much.  Little and indirect interaction, fast game play. Want to play again!

K&K do up a nice filler game that doesnt overstay its welcome like many do, just about the right length actually which was good like 25 minutes.  

Bit of an engine game mixed with set collecting, cards give cumulative bonuses like Taj when you put them in the same column but you still need to build wide too for points creating a couple different ways to score that probably balance.  

Interesting enough while playing but ultimately mostly forgettable (most fillers are though so not really a knock as such).  Played well 2 players and I imagine 3 would be good, I'd be wary of bigger numbers due to the sword currency system and swords coming out randomly.

RULES OVERVIEW
-----------------------
A light set collection game which also has a bit of engine building. Players buy cards from a display of six with costs written on the cards. Cards come in different colours, these are the sets which you collect. When you buy a card you get to activate it and all other cards you have of the same colour. When a card is activated you get the listed benefits which can be a combination of sabers, coins, and gems. Coins are needed to buy more cards and gems are victory points. The sabers are used to take cards from a separate card display. You can both buy a card and take one with sabers each turn. You must pay 3 sabers to take a card +1 saber if the card has the saber icon. Cards can have a final icon which is a treasure chest. Points are awarded at the end of the game for most, second most, and third most treasure chests in each colour.

THOUGHTS
--------------
Deciding which card to buy can be fun, and there is a bit to consider in order to optimize, as you try to edge out your opponents. Coins, sabers, gems, and treasure chests are all very useful, you would like to have a source of all of these, but that is difficult to achieve. 

It will be interesting to see how future plays go. I'm a bit worried about how scripted the game is, different games may not feel very different at all. I'm also concerned that the luck is a bit too much for my liking.

Pretty interesting..; set collection? Tableau building? Whatever. Pretty interesting game.

Only flaw is that you can really get a runaway leader. Perhaps just because someone didn't understand the game properly and thus let someone else get tiles they really shouldn't be allowed to have. Or just plain luck of the draw.

RATING: 6.5
A very straight-forward design where players draft cards (paying the appropriate amount) and begin a collection of treasures (that are in multiple colors).  The cards drafted have treasure chests (for end-game majorities), sabers (to conquer other chests when you collect three), money or gems (worth 3 dollars during the game and 5 dollars at the end of the game.  Gems are basically the VPs of the games.  Here's the catch: if you draft a card of a color you already have you also get the bonuses from all the other cards you have in that color.  This excludes the treasure chests which only count at the end of the game and this is where it gets difficult as you're trying to balance between an engine you're building and collecting treasures for the end game majorities.  Note cards with the most treasures have the least amount of additional bonuses.  Also, the cards with the most treasures are the cheapest to purchase but do not provide as much (or any) future purchasing power.
     The number of sets (colors) depends on the number of players but since there are so many of them it's hard not to have a bit of AP trying to determine which one's you want as points are rewarded at the end of the game for 1st, 2nd and 3rd in each color.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
A streamlined engine building game with several ways to score and two currencies. Very engaging, with an ever-changing market. The one downside is that there's a lot of banking, as one buys up to two cards and takes income each round. Nonetheless, one that should hit the table more often...

RATING: 5
Very light, with heavy adjacent player binding (you want to avoid what the person on your right is doing) and a robust rich-get-richer endgame.  Perhaps good with fewer players, but with 5 you could tell who the contenders were halfway in.

RATING: 5
A light card collecting game that begs you to concentrate on one colour to build a money / sabre / chest / jewel production engine (these are the resources the cards variously provide), but wants you to diversify across the colours for end-game bonuses. Each time you collect a card, each previously collected card in that colour produces again. Money allows you to buy more cards, sabres allow you to collect discarded cards, most chests in each colour give you jewels at end of game, and most jewels wins the game. You may want to collect treasure chests in your non-engine colours to sneak end-of-game bonuses. Turns are very simple - buy a card from the 6 card draft, get a card from the discard board if you enough sabres, replenish the draft. As light as it gets. Go once through the deck, add up the points. With 2 players, you probably need to make an investment in each colour to at least ensure second place and reduce the bonus differential, so there's a decision to make on how and when to do this. With more players, the similar decision will be when to invest in engine and when to "race" for treasure chests. Otherwise the game seems pretty straight forward, maybe too straight forward. It's innocuous enough to play, but I'm unsure that there's enough oomph here for ongoing table time.

RATING: 6
A decent fast paced affair where you're trying to just pip your opponent in the number of treasure chests of a certain suit (up to eight - depending upon the number of players). What makes this clever is that you're really encouraged by the game system to specialise in just a couple of the suits. Each new card you gain of a suit activates the income of the previously held suits. Alongside this you're looking to increase your income your gems and the number of sabres, yet the cards that provide these do not give you the treasure chests.

Managing all the bits and income is a little fiddly, but not overly so. You'll find yourself performing various bits of arithmetic in your head each turn, but don't worry - it's usually all in the single digits.

So there's some luck and the decisions aren't really very difficult, but it plays quickly and has it's place in an evening of gaming.

The 2-player game is fast!  But I think it may lack some tightness which makes it less than stellar to play that way.  I think it's best with 4 probably although 3 and 5 seem fine too.

Initial impression is that you figure out the best cards to acquire from a very limited set, then see what the result is when the deck runs out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game is fairly simple. There are seven cards in each color and depending on the number of players you'll play with some/all of the colors (red, blue, green, purple, yellow, white, black, brown). The cards have symbols on them for money, swords, gems and treasure chests. During the game, whenever you get a card you get the money, swords or gems that are on that card. Additionally, you retrigger any cards of that color you already own. At the end of the game you get gems for having most, secondmost or thirdmost treasure chests for each color (7/4/1).

On your turn you buy a card (and you have to sell off stuff if you can't afford to), and optionally spend 3 (or 4) swords to take a card from the pirates table, and then move a card from the purchase row to the pirate's table. Then you refill the purchase row and continue on to the next player. The game ends when you get to the end of the regular deck and there's a final special round where you can only raid cards.

The game is a pretty quick filler game but has a lot of interesting decisions. I love the look of the cards and the pirates table board... they're quite beautiful. The box itself is rather goofy and not so pretty.

Kind of neat.  I like how you can combo off of your own stack by adding to it and receiving bonuses you've already obtained before.  The set collecting with majority control is a familiar mechanic and should not be overlooked, since 2nd place nets you four gems and it could often be easily taken just by a single card.  Game can be potentially vicious with high factor of screw-age.

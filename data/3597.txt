First hockey sim I played so it's the one I am most familiar with.  Good flow using a combination of play action cards and dice.  Lots of mods out there to enhance game play but overall a very good hockey sim.

More than any other sport, everything in hockey is interrelated and hard to decipher. Player abilities are often impossible to divine from stats, and it all seems pretty mechanical here: the way the player cards are pasted together like puzzle pieces, without regard to their effect on the overall whole. 

Players are rated in just four broad categories (1 to 4) in passing, breakaway/penetration, and offense (shots), and 1 to 5 in defense. The top players in history are thus  restricted by these upper bounds. 

Goal-scoring ability is biased toward shot percentage, which leads to excessive goals for the high-percentage players, since every choice you make will attempt to get these players to shoot. 

Conversely, low-percentage shooters won't get the goals they should. For example, Phil Esposito in 1970-71 had a 13.8% scoring percentage-- pretty good, but nothing special. However, he scored a whopping 76 goals that season! Due to the game's design, though, you'll always be trying to get his *linemates* to shoot, since they had higher percentages.

Penalties have just five categories and they're not broken down into minors, majors and fighting majors!

Good defensive players get extra, direct shots on goal from their defensive skill, and these shots are not correlated with their offensive-based SOGs.

"Intimidation" is based on some arcane combination of penalty minutes/ability to intimidate/ability to prevent opponent shots with dirty play, all of which doesn't necessarily correlate. 

Fighting (and its after-effects) is not implemented well. There is nothing regarding hits or momentum. 

On the plus side, the super advanced power play is done very well and provides a lot of excitement.

Enjoyed this years ago, and see that they've added some new bells & whistles (goalie fatigue rating, deflection shot opportunity, etc.) but for realism, forward lines should really be changed every 2 action cards (for 80 second shifts) which unfortunately would kill the game's flow and divert over half your session to picking up player cards and laying out new ones instead of actually playing.

I've been playing this for at least 30 years -- usually take six teams and have them play a double round-robin, meaning they each play 10 games, 30 games total. I keep the stats, and keep year-to-year records. It's good fun.

RATING: N/A
I have yet to play, but I am thinking about getting the most up to date set from the strat-o-matic people because the current set I own is from 73 I think, Montreal vs. Detroit.  Interesting, but not THAT interesting, however give me some players I know, then I think this could be the greatest sports game known to man, fo hockey anyway.

My second favorite game from Strat-o-Matic, right behind the baseball game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I was this game's biggest proponent since day one in 1978, but I grew weary of the constant tweaking needed to account for weaknesses in the game engine and design.  I did have many years of fun with it; the game does have a nice flow and can create some dramatic moments. Back then I would have rated it a 9.

The player cards are hard on the eyes and as usual, Strat is clueless when it comes to the graphics aspect of their products.  And since hockey is way down on the list of Strat's priorities, they have done nothing to improve the product apart from a box of band-aids called "super advanced rules" in 1993. 

The variables in the ratings categories are too basic to accurately define the players' abilities, especially when players have extreme seasons. The player cards are just too "cookie-cutter".  The penalty system is unrealistic.  High penalty minute players will get accurate totals, but they will get those minutes from many misconducts and few fighting majors, the inverse of real life.

To their credit, they have produced quite a few retro seasons (buoyed by hard-core gamers willing to do the research) but even then you only get 6 teams carded and the remaining teams are on a PDF file you have to print yourself, so those cards wind up not looking like the Strat-produced teams.

Once I discovered Inside the Crease Hockey from Inside Sports, I left Strat behind for good.

This rating is for the board version by the way.  I never attempted the computer version;  just read all the complaints on Strat forums about the patches and glitches that are constant with this game.  The fact that the computer game had to include various algorithms (such as allowing up to 35 action card readings per period whereas the board game is 30 action cards per period) to account for flaws in the board game engine says a lot.

Simply the best board game hockey simulation out there.  It has the flow and speed of hockey with all the coach decision making and line up match ups.  The scores are always very realistic and the games are exciting to play.  I would like to find a league close by where the boardgame is used as compared to the Strat-O-Matic Computer version.  Computers are great but they just don't have the same feel as the board game head-to-head version.  This game plays very well solitaire as well.  Excellent choice an dcost effective if you are looking for a good hockey simulation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good hockey game.  Fun to play.  I like the way penalties are quickly resolved in the basic version based on powerplay opportunities as opposed to actually playing out the PP.  What hurts this game is a lack of seasons and Strats notoriously bad customer service.  I rank it slightly below (just slightly) APBA hockey and below my favourite game of Hockey Blast.

Definitely worth the money, just prefer Hockey Blast.

I'm a huge hockey fan and played this for maybe 6-7 years, in various setups including league play. As a statistical tool, it does a passable job. As a simulator of the experience of hockey, it's flawed. As a game, it fails completeley. The score reflects the fact strat-o-matic still manages to be king of this genre. It's more an evaluation of my passion for hockey than my thoughts on the game, otherwise this would be worth a 3. It's anyone's guess why someone else hasn't come up with a more entertaining and engrossing hockey game.

I love this game so much I have not even bothered looking at other hockey games. I can play a typical game in under an hour with modern teams. If I play with teams from the 90s and later it may be a little longer due to that fact there were more penalties in those years. Once you get the hang of setting your lines and specialty teams the game plays quick. I like the individual players rating system for offense/defense/face off/ penalty killing although I think some are very generous. It helps to create the importance of choosing how you want to match your lines with an opponents. Very good solitaire play as well. I own many seasons and have spent countless hours playing this game. I never tire of it.

Diehard fans of NFL Hockey frequently say this is one of the best sports simulations made by Strat-O-Matic. They also say the game is better than any other attempts to replicate real hockey. Best of all: many serious players (those who play a whole season) believe it plays nearly the same w/ one or two players. That's a real benefit when the Winters are long & cold & dark!

RATING: 6
Components are dated and of crappy quality, but the engine is solid and damn if it doesn't tell a story. Pretty much everything is here -- shooting, passing, breakaways, loose pucks, penalties ... Neutral zone action is a little vague, but the action around the goals is nicely detailed, and power plays are vividly reconstructed. A great game for replays, but I've had the system break down in draft leagues -- I think there's a pretty delicate balance with the way defense is handled, and when teams load up with too many extreme offense/defense ratings I've seen some strange results.

Not that good a game. It is too random and the skill of the player ain't as important as it should be. Also, players should improve (or weaken due to wounds or age) as you go through seasons without the use of updated cards.
All Strat-o-matic games are made to do a quick buck with their cards you need to order each seasons to be updated instead of having a system where you can update them yourself and a player progression system.

Great game. Although I wouldn't go so far as to say it simulates the feel of real Hockey. If anything, it does an awesome job of simulating a live box score that you would see on ESPN.com or some similar website. Changing lines is tedious, but necessary. The game can be played solitare which is a plus if you're really in need of a Puck-fix, but I prefer head-to-head play against a real opponent sitting across from me. There is a computer version of the game available, yet there is no online matching feature on it yet. What's the point of buying that game if it's solo-only?

RATING: 7
The best hockey boardgame I have ever played. Still, as a game it provides too few choices to rate much higher. After lines are decided, the game pretty much runs its course without you. Main decision by the gamer is: if your player has the puck outside, does he skate in closer, pass, or shoot the puck? Again. Again. Again. The super-advanced-game power play really shines. Real players allow for drafting leagues. Must have for hockey fans. 

(Must note that this is my opinion from the 1988 version. Comments from other Geeks indicate they may have updated the rules since then).

Unless you keep your team cards up to date, *and* you know your NHL teams/players, then this is a very hard game to play *well*.

This game was an obsession as a solitaire game and also with friends. We played several full seasons with the sets starting with 1979/80 and through 1984/85.  

The extra player sets are essential if playing a season simulation.

The "Any Player" rules must be adhered to for shooting or statistical accuracy will go out the window.

This was the first Strat game I purchased back in 1980, even before baseball, and I still play it to this day.  I play the computer version more now but this is far and away the best hockey game I have played in the admittedly thin field of hockey sims. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played umpteen solo games and also participated in some PBEM replays.  Recreates the back and forth of hockey with action cards, and this abstraction keeps the game moving at a relatively brisk pace.  It's fun enough that I can even get my wife to play me head to head sometimes.  However, the game engine results in some wonky player cards with nonsensical ratings.  Line changes and ice time can be a pain to recreate.  Also, it tries to nail down the hockey theme, but its not perfect (ex. enforcers).  I would still bust this out pretty much any night, however.

20 years ago I would have rated this game an 11... I played this for hours and hours... and hours. Both solitaire and with my best friends. Keeping stats and drafting players for teams... smack talk... frustration when your best goalie was injured and your back-up tended goal like a sieve. Using the advanced or super advanced rules really upped the strategy levels... and made the game longer as well. This game had it all when you really got into it. But alas it isn't 20 years ago and my rating reflects my current ratings. In the right situations and with the right friends I'd certainly still play the game but it's like that song says...

A sports simulation has wandered into a database of games. Compared to other hockey simulations, this has all the usually SOM drawbacks: rating scale can't accommodate extreme performances, player abilities are hard to read (being crammed into a matrix of 2d6 results), and it's boring. Also, jumbo cards are incompatible with the OCD desire for frequent line changes. A valiant effort, and no doubt popular for a reason, just not my cup of Tim Horton's.

Re-purchased this after owning as a child many years ago. It's a good game, though not quite as polished as SOM Baseball. Not as strategic as Advanced Football. The gap between Basic and Advanced is less than Adv to Super Adv, and the last of these may feel a bit clunky (but you do have more decisions). The game doesn't simulate every pass of course. Line changes are abstracted, correctly IMO. Even then, it can be bothersome to change personnel for Power Plays.

Now own all four SOM boxed games.
Purchased a hockey selector set Aug '07. Never fond of the S-O-M component quality, and the hockey contents are the worst of them all. Just punched out the split deck, and the flimsy cards are in four different sizes due to the poor cutting. There is about an 1/8" difference between the biggest and smallest cards making the deck very difficult to shuffle.And the action deck contains two different sized cards, with a 1/4" difference in width bet.
Fortunately, I contacted SOM and they are going to replace the two decks at no charge.[UPDATE: the replacement decks they sent me are worse than the originals, with six different card sizes in the split deck]

The NHL overtime and shootout rules have been in effect for a couple seasons now, but the S-O-M rule book doesn't include them; a shootout rule is given on the team roster sheet only.

Game sorely needs a graphic update, as well as higher quality split and action decks. Larger type size on the cards would also be a big plus. I realize the heart of the S-O-M system is the statistical analysis that makes the games yield accurate results, but it would be nice to see the games given a 21st century treatment.
Game play is the least realistic of the four sports SOM offers. Line changes take place only three times during a period (barring special teams): forward lines change twice while defensemen change just once. 45-year-old Chris Chelios has to play 30 minutes a game - he's going to get tired!
Game takes me about an hour to play solo; haven't found anyone yet who's interested in playing a hockey board game.

In my opinion, the best hockey simulation game on the market.  Easy to learn rules get you into the game quickly, and it's a good representation of an actual NHL hockey game. The one thing that keeps this game from being rated higher is the penalty system, it needs a complete overhaul to make it more realistic. For the average player it's probably fine, but for a statistical junkie like myself its' simplicity does detract from the game a bit.

One of my all time favorite games.  Typical SOM.  You have more control of the action on the "ice" than in other hockey simulations.  Components are good quality.  Many past seasons are available.  Rules have been updated a few times over the past ten years and SOM probably needs to re-write and re-print them to consolidate all the updates based on the most recent version I have.

Not great if you want to replay an entire season because a single game takes about an hour and a half or so.

Really easy to understand game involving making sets on a common board. Mind bending trying to work out when to call and when to move. Probably not one for the tired... :)

Making drinks by moving around bottles of booze between bartenders. Very original game, with intriguing game play. Interesting for hardcore gamers and casual gamers alike. Met the designers at Spiel 2010. Great guys! I highly recommend this game.

An interesting game with nice pieces, but certainly rather too chaotic when played with 5.

Want to try again with 3 or 4 though.

Party para jugar entre juegos dada que su duración es escasa. Para nada imprescindible pero jugable y sobreproducido en componentes. Curiosa mecánica la que usa para cambiar botellas de un sitio a otro.

First to rate, cool. I really enjoyed this game in prototype form. Haven't seen or played final copy. It's impossible for final copy to live up to prototype in terms of components, but the pictures look good. Definitely one of the better fillers in quite a while. While many filler these days seem to either be too complicated for a filler (Alea Iacta) or no interesting decisinos (Jaipur). This hits the sweet spot of interesting decisions with simple rules in a short time. Perfect recipe for a filler.

I played this game many times in prototype form, and have always enjoyed it.  There is some degree of luck based on how well your drinks match up with what others are trying to do, but it's appropriate for a lighter game like this.  Be sure to play the deluxe set with actual alcohol.

Great game with the right crowd. I'm not fond of set collection games, but this game makes up for it because of speed and the pretty components, which enhance the bartender theme. You feel yourself working hard in a buzy bar and striving to get your orders done.

Cute little game. Played the prototype several times with REAL miniature bottle and was always miffed when Kris never allowed me to drink the content.
Now I am looking forward to buy my own miniature bottles for the final version - and play it with MY way!  :-)

Interesting mental exercise, but with too many players there is a bit of frustration that is entirely out of your control and the winner is whoever benefits the most from other players actions.

Only played with two and when you read "special rules for two players" in the rules you know that you're not REALLY playing the game as it was envisioned. Lovely pieces though and no doubt better with more players.

Decent but not great euro game, pretty unique mechanics, as the game is basically set collection where everyone is able to directly effect all the different hands and use any of them.  The theme is clever but doesn't really tie into the mechanics as well as it should.  A game I would play again if requested.

This is a game even my nongamer wife likes. The goal is to make the drinks on your cards by combining the different alcohols. Cards are delt to bartenders carrying different types of alcohol. Then you have a chance to move the particular alcohol to another bartender when both have cards. Move the alcohols until you get the drink on the card or if you get close take a penalty for how far off you are.

This "real time" game is quite fun, and the components are awesome. A cool, sober playstyle is often rewarded, which somehow feels unfitting in a party-ish game.

A fun silly filler game but with enough flavor that will make it last way past its first ten plays. The ice cubes are great.

Not very deep, but the components are quite nice, and the gameplay is fluid. Wouldn't buy, but would not refuse to play as a filler.

Feels a bit like a Bazaar-light to me.

Fun filler. There's too little game in here for me, but I'm tempted to buy it because of the components (neat bottles and ice cubes)

Update: bought it 4 years later to play with my son, and as a filler.

It is like one of thoese maths/physics problems where you have to move items between recipients doing as few movements as possible... But now, you have to do them as fast as possible. During the main phase, everything goes fast and you priorize quickness over optimal decisions.

But once someone has finished, everyone else must do some calculations and since now they can take their time, the game drags a bit.

It's not a game I will plan to play and there are many games I'd prefer to play, but I would not turn down a game from time to time.

One of those games where you just kind of do the obvious thing when it is available for you to take advantage of it.  Most of the time you are waiting for the right combos to shuffle their way around close enough for you to score.  Dullsville.

That said, I don't think that this game was really intended for gamers, so perhaps I'm not the intended target audience.

I'm tempted to knock another point off for having cards with the worst combinations of liquor.  Every time I looked at my hand I wanted to gag thinking about drinking the awful concoctions (e.g. two Gins, two Irish Creams, and a Triple Sec, BLECH!!!)

The ice cubes are great though.

1 play, 4er

A fun little fillery game of pattern recognition and manipulation with some cool looking bits! Not a deep game, but it's not meant to be: play it quickly!

--- Summary ---
The game starts with several bartenders having a bunch of bottles of a single type. Each player has 4 different drink mixes -- combinations of 2-5 alcohols. Dealer starts flipping bartender cards, placing them in front of the matching dealer. Any player can call 'ORDER UP!' to stop this, and move a bottle from one bartender to another, as long as both have cards in front of them (exception: if one has 3 cards, may move a bottle to any location). Players may play their combo cards if the required combination exists at any bar; but they take one ice cube for every extra bottle at the bar. The player calling ORDER UP becomes the new dealer, and the game continues. When any player has finished all 4 cards, the others (in order) finish their remaining cards by moving one bottle at a time as they like, taking an ice cube for each such move. The player with the fewest ice cubes wins!

Got a chance to try it at Gencon and really liked it. You push your luck to get the correct combination of ingredients before the other players do. If you have extra ingredients, you have to take -1 vp for each incorrect ingredient (represented as ice cubes.) However if you go out first, the other players must complete their orders with what is left on the table which can be a pretty stiff penalty.  Simple, light and fun.

I really didn't much enjoy this one. Players have little control over what happens ... and most of what happens is dull, moving bottles from card to card and hoping other players don't undo what you did. The end game is pretty much broken, as any player after the first one to mix their final drinks is pretty much assured of seeing the players ahead of them completely change the layout of the bottles. The bits are quite nice and the theme is kinda cool, but the gameplay is uninteresting.

RATING: 7.3
Very quick fun filler game (our second game took 5 minutes for someone to order all their drinks).  However there is a major disadvantage to being the last person to finish off your drink cards.  I got caught in both games by taking the turn before the person who then finished their order. Whilst you can pay attention to who only has one card left, if someone finishes two off at the end you can get caught.

The theme looked so cool so was disappointed by this 'eh' game. Its funish but a little too complicated for an alcohol themed game and why bring out an ok game when you can bring out a great one

A light family game about drinking . . .

It's ok, but it can be a little slow.

RATING: 6
Nice presentation for the game. Good fun and fairly quick. A little more thinking than might first appear. Requires fairly quick pattern matching skills. Some distress as your goal moves repeatedly further away depending on other players drinks. Five seems a little chaotic, three is pretty good. Probably three and four are the sweet spot.

It is a little slow at first as you try to move the drinks around but are not close to any combos yet. That probably would stop it from rising from its present rating.

I really love this game. It's simple and quick, and very fun and entertaining to play.

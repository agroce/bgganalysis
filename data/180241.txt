GAME: Warhammer: Age of Sigmar
RANK: 3970

RATING: 1
Nice models.  

Four (4) pages of rules.  While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, there is zero balancing mechanic for gameplay outside of the manufacturer provided scenarios.  Lack of army balance and composition controls severely limits replay value unless the players are just interested in pushing models around, making "pew pew" noises and rolling dice.

Do not recommend this game for anyone looking for a wargame or anything involving strategy or anything resembling a strategic experience.  Non-scenario games generally result in a massive "scrum" in the middle of the table.

Especially disliked the party-game type rules that were added to the older armies' units (surprisingly none in the new army) requiring players to dance or otherwise act a fool to activate special abilities or even make regular attacks.  While this could be fun and lighthearted in moderation, this will get old very quickly, especially for units where these can't be ignored like Greasus' bribery rule that only works if you are able to actually bribe your opponent.

Truly a simpler game that is really easy to get into. But such a big step away from the original that defines Warhammer fantasy is really sad. The flavour of armies clashing has given way to a more skirmish feel. Points are missing too. Overall, slightly disappointed. 

Otherwise. The minis are really good and beautiful. Thought the feel of the masked faces do mimic 40k.

El plástico de las miniaturas es de la mejor calidad imaginable. 

Teniendo en cuenta que es el juego que sustituye a warhammer, no puedo evitar cierto aire nostálgico y un importante grado de rechazo. El juego no es malo pero sabe a poco comparado con sus predecesores. Las miniaturas son reutilizables pero el juego no es lo que era, aunque insisto, no me parece malo. 

Sin duda, le voy a dar una oportunidad a Age of Sigmar porque tengo muchos amigos para jugar y la calidad de las miniaturas es muy alta.

Games Workshop has been floundering for sometime now and this game could be the beginning of the end. They've killed off Warhammer Fantasy Battles, the game that really made their name, and replaced it with a game that has no depth or balance. The new miniature ranges and lore is also a step in the wrong direction and poor quality. The days of Blood Bowl, Warhammer Quest and Mordheim seem very distant now and I sincerely doubt that Games Workshop can ever repeat those past glories.

Age of Sigmar is truly a build, paint and game experience, with possibly the best made miniatures in the market, a gutsy "no nonsense" game engine that can be expanded for years to come, and warscrolls that put back the fun and theme in every battle. 10 to compensate for the idiots out there.

Impressive. GW is trolling us! This is NOT even a game since doesn't have PLAYABLE rules. It's just a parade for your miniatures and an occasion to throw dice without balance or strategy or fun. I can't believe they made this sh!t, it's the last nail on GW coffin.

Whilst the rules are really simple allowing accessibility the depth comes from the units themselves. Trying to remember to use every units special abilities at the right time gives this game masses of depth. I preferred the Old World but the game is now s massive improvement.

Not a great game, as such, but a fantastically more fun way to play with fantasy miniatures than the WFB rule set. I've been looking at the whole miniature hobby again. I want a game, not a lifestyle, and this set of rules works for me. Good work GW.

RATING: 1
Wow, finally a game truly deserving of the 1 rating, according to BGG ratings.

This is the most broken game ever.
-There's literally no points limit. The only limit is how many figures you can literally fit onto the table.
-A goblin is as likely to wound a zombie, as it is a dragon or a hero.
-Ranged units can shoot while they are in melee.
-And on top of that, some of the units require you to literally talk to your units/ hide units in your hands and have your opponent guess which hand it is in, etc.

I'm not exagerating when I say this is the worst designed game ever made.

RATING: 6
All things considered - I think this box set serves as a great introduction to wargaming. Far more accessible than the WHFB editions of old, significantly reduced entry cost (with a decent selection of starting miniatures included - and although others are still pricey, they are nevertheless cheaper than when I was a teenager), completed by a simple non-intimidating ruleset. The skirmish system (as opposed to full-on units) feels as though it gives a lot more flexibility. However, I would advocate rounds consisting of single unit activated per player per turn, all of which have to be activated or skipped before a new round begins.

I am well aware of the various controversies surrounding its release, but I fall firmly in the camp of those who see it as a bold yet innovative change for the better. 

Chiefly reminiscent of a MOBA adapatation, with units piling in to keep each other busy, while unique characters provide tactical buffs and go for the main objectives - I think this is the best way to view the overall design of this interpretation, which works best on battlefields with plenty of terrain.

I just wish a number of 'modifier tokens' for each of the four overall faction were included, to physically show active effects.

Rules light in principle, but like many GW games all the special rules attached to units make a mockery of the basic simplicity, and introduce no end of imbalance.  Game degenerated to some protracted melees in my experience and lacked subtlety.

RATING: 9
Amazingly good upgrade to Warhammer.  I still love old 3rd edition, but this new game is a good new direction.

The narrative play with battlescrolls is a very nice change of pace from straight points battles, though that is all here if you want it. The scrolls add lots of depth to the game that is only apparent when you start playing with them.  The four page rules make adding new special abilities much easier.

The new background takes a bit of getting used to, but once you see that it is Mythic Fantasy, and not the pastiche of high fantasy and swords & sorcery of the old world, it makes much more sense.

Models are very impressive and much more durable than you would guess just looking at them.  

Citadel has made a big switch from drybrushing to layer painting and lining, which is one big reason for the big change in how the painted minis look now.  The new techniques definitely take some getting used to, but it is designed to make painting quicker and easier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great fun as a beer&pretzel style-tabletop game! I'm really enjoying the narrative/often asymmetric -style of playing and the narrative it creates. (The fun of this obviously depends very much on if both players are on the same page.) Points are ok too, but I'm not sure how the current General's Handbook (v1) works in the competetive tournament-world. I also enjoy the buckets of dice and painting the great (albeit expensive) miniatures.

(And most importantly, I actually come around playing this game regularly. It's also easy start again after a longer pause just because the core rules are that simple.)

The minis are spectacular.  The game, pretty good.  Easy to play, and understand, which, if you want to have more mass appeal, makes good financial sense.

I was one who was completely against this game when it came out. However, after the points for units came out I gave it a shot and LOVED it! It is such a great game. The base rules are streamlined and simple, however, where the complexity comes in is each individual units special rules, this leaves the game being easy to learn. Game is far better than 40k. I will be selling my 40k stuff now.

At first I was kind of snotty about that. Who'd want a "simplified" miniature game? Turns out, I do. AoS plays much quicker than the cumbersome 40K (7th ed.), and it's also faster to prep, as list building is really easy (yet avoids the shenanigans from 7th edition 40K). It took the General's Handbook to get me to this point though, as I'm still not a big fan of "bring whatever".

RATING: 7
"Warhammer: Age of Sigmar" (AoS) replaces "Warhammer: Fantasy Battles" (WFB) after 20+ years.  It isn't the same game, it isn't a new version, it's a new game with a new story and new mechanics. So I'm rating both differently.

Many players think AoS should never have been made, and there should be a WFB 9th edition instead.  I understand the anger of these longtime WFB players.  I'm a veteran myself since 1997.

Look at all the ratings of 1 here by disgruntled players.  It's normal they're angry, since WFB got discontinued after 8th editions and it was an investmentheavy game.  These players have every right to rate AoS a 1, for emotional reasons alone.

My best gaming moments were when playing WFB 10 years ago.  But my life changed.  I didn't have the time, space, money, mental energy anymore to play WFB.

Now, because of AoS and its smallerscale games, I'm fielding models on the battlefield again.  It's quicker, simpler, less expensive,  I rate it an 8 for bringing me back to the wargaming table.

The dumbing down of Warhammer fantasy, combined with the desperate attempt to copy warmachine leaves this game sucking wind, except for the even stupider decision to destroy the whole fantasy world in order to ensure that the lawyers have something they can have a better  basis for writing cease and desist letters about.  WHFB went down hill as the company increasingly tried to milk the various rules for leverage towards sales, instead of creating a product that was fundamentally a good game( and thus ensuring sales in the long term).  Just bad, even with the crap they are attempting to layer on to fix it but there is only so much you can copy from privateer press while keeping what is essentially an awful game.

Rating would be 3 lower if I was using the army selection rules given by Games Workshop.

Compared to previous GW fantasy battle sets, I hugely dislike the look of the starter set miniatures.  Over-large, fetish-y, overly complicated, pin-headed, and don't get me started on the identical sculpting and 'golden robot' paint jobs on the Sigmar forces.

RATING: 8
Vastly under-rated due to backlash from former WFB players not liking the new background, lack of balanced competiative play and sweeping rules changes.  Points are back and the ease of play adds to speed as well as tactics.  Easy enough to teach an eight year old to play and complex enough make a forty-something glower when their plans and dice let them down.

Only a couple of plays in, but my experience is that it is competitive and fun. The rules have a few interesting nuances that make it very good.  

I may even convince a few new guys to try the game, now that it costs a $30 box to have a playable small army (instead of hundreds of dollars).

RATING: 6
Have yet to really explore everything the system has to offer.

Not really fond of the starting armies. Someone was talking about a realm where the Wood Elf forest units got repurposed? Now that realm sounds like what I'd want a boxed set from :p

Most things are ok. Warscrolls are cool but silly that they didn't include them on seperate sheets. Same with the range rulers. Just give us a tape measure already, way more useful and can't be that much more expennsive.

Lastly I dislike the round bases. Skirmish game? Sure, round bases are fine. Large armies being fielded? Please use bases that allow us to clearly form units, like WHFB's square bases.
Movement rules are way easier though so that's a big plus.

Ignore all the negative Nancy's comments and try for yourself.  It is, surprisingly, a great game and there a a lot of tactics to discover for yourself rather than being told how to do it within the rules.  And battles don't just end up in a scrum if you play the game properly.

Over the years I have come to prefer skirmish level games to large battles so the initial news that Warhammer (for which I own 7 armies of varying size) was coming out with a skirmish level rule set had me very excited.

My disappointment at the rules was severe.  Even ignoring the lack of any balance between forces unless using a published scenario (for which you own the appropriate models), the new wounding rules make it as likely for a human peasant to wound a dragon as another dragon (saves still provide some difference but without a level of rend it is effectively the same).

I rated it above a 1 as I think there is actually a game (by the barest of definitions) but not high enough to warrant a full 2.

Time to finish working up my fantasy armies for No Quarter.

Do not believe all the nay-sayers. This is a good game that is fun and fairly fast to play (1.5-2 hours). The complexity comes in the war scrolls that add variety to the system. The starter game is great and both factions could win. I have had some quite close games. I am so pleased that I can use all my old miniatures and try cool models that were never great points value in the old system. I also think that getting a balance is achievable by bringing say 2 hero's 2 monsters, x war scrolls and a total wounds limit. On another point the box set is so good value. 48 minis for £62 (store discount) amazing!

Awesome mini's, rules light.  Relies on players to determine fair match ups, rather than an arbitrary points scheme that doesn't accurately reflect unit balance, and leave some units unplayable.  Easy to learn, with only 4 pages of core rules, but lots of depth as each unit brings it's own special rules.

If you are more interested in narrative based games, and focus on the hobby part of the mini's game, this is the game for you.  If you are looking for balanced competitive play, you may wish to look elsewhere.

Wow, I love not having to look up results on a chart, love the dynamic magic system, love the way combat flows up and thru terrain (like the spiral staircase or broken tower), and love that I have a reason to use my old miniatures again.

I'm excited to see more of their scenario/campaign systems. I was impressed that they have built the campaign system to work for any army... I was afraid they would use the campaign system to force you to own every miniature to be able to play them all (like in their hobbit game).

I am not a three year old.  I can handle more than a 4 page rule-set.

Now, that a year has passed since release and the expanded rules came out, I urge anyone who thinks about getting into wargaming to try AoS. Fast, scalable and with many interesting scenarios (or battleplans), Age of Sigmar is all that I wished for a tabletop and more.

I really enjoy the AoS gameplay system.  4 Pages of rules for a tabletop miniatures game that delivers in practice was a master stroke for GW.  I am not a tabletop wargamer normally, so those who are heavier in that hobby may find their mileage to vary, but for a casual gamer such as myself its a win.  If only the non-starter minis were as easy to assemble.

Has some fun elements: Great miniatures, fun list-building with lots of synergies with flavorful warscroll rules, exciting and inspiring setting with a whole-hearted embrace of narrative, casual, and competitive play.

Update: JUL 2016 - GW are releasing a General's Handbook for $25 USD this month. It introduces points to the game and addresses some rules issues with unlimited summoning.

The core rules and warscrolls are actually pretty solid.  I like the CCG-like interaction you can work with different units' abilities.  Suffers from the way it was released (GW angered Warhammer Fantasy fans by abruptly wiping the WFB game including fluff), an odd decision on measurement and model bases and the lack of a point system, making it difficult to play pick-up games.

It tries very hard on the model side (and, in fact, if you intend to use them for another game or for conversions, go for it). The game side is just lacking; the first game or three are fun, but after that, it degenerates into the same thing over and over where a pileup in the middle and just dice mashing determines the result.

In short, it grows boring fast.

Played on Sunday with the free rules and classic armies. There is not a game here, just a hodgepodge of overly simple rules that result in units mushing together and rolling dice until someone wins.  No movement strategy, no picking optimal targets and matching strength to weakness, just smash and roll.  Hope you roll better than the other guy.  Terrible.  And then they have the audacity to admit the "funny" rules are to embarrass older players and keep them from playing in public?  It is just the worst possible release laced with insult...they burned the base for no reason.  Very sad.

RATING: 7
16-07-2015. Rated after 4 plays. Age of Sigmar is the reboot of Warhamer Fantasy Battles. I never played 'mini wargames' like these before except X-Wing.

What attracted me to Age of Sigmar is the simple ruleset and the use of 'warscrolls' to cover most of the mechanisms of the game. I think this is really nice and a good step forward over the codexes the old system.

Age of Sigmar's rules are simple and at points stupid. 

Each round, you have a roll-off to see who determines the start-player.

Then, each unit in the army of the active player may move up to their movement speed. You may not move within 3" of a model.
Then, each unit with ranged attacks with targets in range may make their attack.
Then, each unit between 3 and 12" may charge into melee. To see if that works, you roll two dice and see if you roll higher thna the value in inches you need to charge. If it works, great you charged otherwise your unit is static for the rond.
Melee involves choosing a unit that can attack in melee, then the next player may choose a unit to attack with ad infinitum. Attacking basically revolves a lot of dice to see how many of your attacks hit, then reroll all hits to see if they wound. and then your opponent may make their saves.
Then, there is a battleshock face where units that suffered wounds check if they flee.

I feel it ultimately comes down to a crush into the middle of the board where the forces met. Regardless, it's a fun excersize and there are interactions between units and scrolls that make combat more interesting than it is. What I don't understand is the costs for tactical movement like retreating from range is as expensive as it is. This reduces the manouvering and makes units 'stuck'. Regardless, I didn't feel this games added much in complexity over X-wing OR Battlelore 2 and I liked it as a result.

Stick with WFB 7th or 8th edition (you'll find the old rulebooks and army books on eBay). AoS is over simplified, unbalanced and unsatisfying dross (it's actually annoying to play sometimes!) I can only presume that those giving it a rating of 10 work for Games Workshop.

Or you could try Mantic Games Kings of War which is similar to 8th edition Warhammer Fantasy and they sell much cheaper (and almost as good a quality) miniatures.

This is a really good game. It can be a bit cluttered, and it can be a bit long - it's still a tabletop wargame, after all - but there is so much going for it in terms of the narrative. I think small, skirmish-style games with a narrative RPG-like focus could be amazing. But it's still great to see how the game has evolved so far.

Amazing revision of an already great (but aged) wargaming ruleset. Free rules that are simple and strategic and, most importantly, make the game fun again. I can't wait to see this develop further.

I think its cool that GW is trying to make a simpler, easier to learn ruleset. That's awesome. Unfortunately, the rules, while relatively simple, are still fairly slow paced; there's too much detail in weapons, and model placement requires too much individual measuring and moving. Moving units in a block as per the old rules was a very good thing in most ways; they just needed simpler rules to cover it!
On top of that, the game really seems to be designed around HUGE armies. You usually need at least 30 models in a unit to field them at full power. I really don't get what they are trying to accomplish here, beyond making a game where the player with the most models wins.
That, however, is not the reason for the low rating. The low rating is because a set of combat mechanics on their own does not make a game, and GW has entirely neglected to include an actual game here. There is no balancing system at all, no rules or even guidelines to create an army with. That's the hard part of actually making a battle game, and by leaving them out GW has essentially made it up the players to create the actual game.
Oh, and GW STILL doesn't seem to know that women exist. Its been what, almost 25 years since Warhammer started? What, all the staff lives in an isolated monastery in the Himalayas?

Rating based on a few in store plays. I think this game has potential but we will see....

Even ignoring the fact that it don't have a proper point system (something that, in my humble opinion, is a disgrace) "Age of Sigmar" is a broken game. The rules doesn't allow the player a single tactical decision, there is no risk/resource management, the movement is almost a formality and the skills of the units are extremely imbalanced. Throwing dice for more than an hour with no rhyme or reason isn't fun. 

Four pages of rules? That's ok. I can explain "Battlelore" in less space. But they didn't use that four pages in a proper way. The rules are badly written, with lots of gaps here and there... almost forcing the player to reinvent half of the game in order to make it work.

I loved "Lord of the rings". It was simple but fun. I was a bit sceptical about "Kings of war" but the system, as it is now, works. Even the good old "Battle Masters", with all its randomness, had much more sense than this!

I would have no problem with a more streamlined version of "Warhammer", but this is not the way to go.

I don't even like the miniatures! I think there are unoriginal and too "over the top".

If you want an easy to learn fantasy battle game I recommend you "Battlelore" or "Warhammer: Diskwars". And, by the way, you can buy BOTH of these games for the same price as the starter set of "Age of sigmar".

I'd actually rate it slightly higher than just 1, fun-wise, but it _is_ technically thoroughly broken and has more in common with little children randomly playing with their collection of toys constantly making up new "rules" than with an actual game with actual rules, so...

I guess the General's Handbook will raise this to a middling rating for me, but (miniatures aside) the base game is simply horrendous.

Five plays so far, pretty small pointwise. The rules are quite short and simple for a miniature game, but the unit's have more or less a lot of special rules. Still the gameplay is quite fast and enjoyable.

5 more plays, now with bigger (1000-2000 points). I have a horde army, which makes bigger games slower, but a big monster or two should make the game play faster. And using the same army list couple of times in a row instead of changing it every time... Too much time is spent on reading the special rules etc.

I've played many iterations of Warhammer since 1986 and I have to say this is my favourite. I really like the fact that things die thick and fast and there is a much more cinematic feel to it all rather than the rules heavy, rigid maneuvering of the last one.

Very simplified wargaming not enough depth to necessitate the cost of the hobby. Probably more deserving of a 4-5 rating but I have chosen to rate it a 1 out of spite for the companies backhanded destruction of the game I loved.

Simplified rule-set allows for less fiddly combat. The biggest changes are 1) rolling to hit and wound are now dependent solely on the attacker, making combat faster 2) morale and Battleshock Tests directly affect unit health making unit death swifter 3) units do not come with tons of upgrade options, typically you have 2 versions of a unit you can take; though now you can upgrade heroes with a single item and units with a single standard 4) difficult terrain isn't a thing, so no worrying about charging over a wall or through the woods. All-in-all I greatly appreciate the simplicity as it makes the game flow but still provides tactical depth. There is much greater flexibility in army selection and creation, so you don't feel so confined to a specific META in your choices.

Great set! It includes all the elements you need to play the game but you need to buy some extra stuff to put it all together and painting it all is expected. This box includes 2 armies that are great for building on, specially since you can combine them with other armies. The booklet is great at getting you into the story and setting up the game but you'll want to buy some other books afterwards to expand you knowledge of the worlds history and continue the story.

It's also sold at a great price, you are basically buying one army and getting the other army and everything else for free. It comes out to less if you get a discount.

There is nothing here that is playable as a game as we know it - in order to have "fun" you have to forego any competetive mindset whatsoever as if you try to play according to the rules in order to optimise your chances of winning the game breaks down completely.

This is essentially a miniatures based RPG, and as such does not in particular belong on BGG as there is no "game" here in the context of the content of this site.

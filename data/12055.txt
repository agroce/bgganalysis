Haven't played as it seems too beautiful to punch out without being ready to play. Graphics are absolutely amazing as are the production values.Looking forward to playing this when I win the Lotto. Rules read clean but I don't usually like tactical games so fingers crossed.

C'mon ... what is even in the same class? Have you seen it all set up for the campaign game in all its glory?

We played a turn or so at our club ( www.nycwargames.com ) and it was intense. Too much to sustain but we all are glad we got to give it a go.

I haven't played it yet, just in the process of counter clipping, I think it's going to take 36 hours! The map is a work of art as are the counters, it is a beautiful game. It is all very big, the Turn sequence card is bigger than many wargame maps!!
Content alone it's a 9.

Update. Rules are surprisingly readable, might even get to play this at some point.

RATING: 7
A magnificently luxurious package. Not as complex a game as the extensive sequence of play might lead one to believe, but it needs dedication to play. I've tried soloing it a few times, and I can really only see myself playing this over a weekend as part of a team, and even then it'll only be one of the smaller scenarios.

RATING: 9
You have to give this a high mark on components alone, but once you get past the rulebook and start playing, it seems to function well. I'd love to get into this more, but on the basis on very limited play, I think this is a top quality piece of work

The quality of the L2 Design is outstanding.  A monster game.  But the rules just wouldn't sink in for me, and the CG was too much of a monster/mess.  A "10" for quality ... but a "5" for overall enjoyment and playability.

RATING: 9.8
Streets of Stalingrad has beautiful components, but does take a while to get used to the 1942 Historical Unit symbols vs the conventional NATO symbols.  As there is much game interaction this does not pose a handicap, as the new unit conventions are rapidily assimilated as the game progresses. The map is beautiful and so is the counter art- everything one could ask for in a game!  Why not a 10?   The Soviet counter-offensive is not included (Operation Uranus), and alternate German stratgies especially in set-up for the coming battle lend the game more to a historical re-play.  Still a must-have & endless value- you could play this game & none else!

RATING: 2
this isn't a game, it is a re-enactment.  chrome upon chrome upon chrome is no path to realism, and certainly when the game is far too long to ever be truly playtested.  but then, the point isn't to make a game or even to worry if it is balanced or not...

RATING: 9
Excellent game on Stalingrad. A lot of phases to a game turn, with 8 opportunities to fire your artillery but you can only fire once.  Determining when to fire the artillery is your biggest headache. Playable monster lots of chrome, love the need to keep battalion/regimental integrity to get the much needed mods. As per Wolf's comments, becomes a meat grinder once you enter the city proper. As the germans the decisions are when to commit assault engineers and armor and boy do the casualties mount up. The russians have their own issues in where to defend and shift reinforcements and those NKVD are a liability. Its a blast to play either VASL or live.

RATING: 7
The game provides a detailed tactical view of the battle and With the revised rule book which adds a bloodier CRT etc, there is now a chance for the attacker. Several scenarios are provided which have a chance to be completed in a normal lifetime. Still the basic system is playable and gives a feel for how a division may fight its companies... but it is a long game to play, figure one player on one map would take over an hour to do a turn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The graphics are simply stunning, and despite the monsterous dimensions of the game, it is surprisingly easy to play. However, make no mistake that it is the definitive game on the battle of Stalingrad, so it can take a while for the campaign game. Fortunately, the game is broken down to a number of very well designed and digestable scenarios that are playable in a day or so. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've played it face to face and it's pretty well done, though time consuming.  You have to put a great deal of effort into allocating the resources for your attacks and defenses (the proper mix of troops and support assets is as important as raw firepower factors) - this does not qualify as a dumb game.  Contains a number of scenarios and you can easily get your money's worth from them without ever venturing near the campaign game.  Even the shorter ones will require a fair investment of time (either multiple game sessions or a weekend) to get through.

I was hesitant to rate this game...we clearly aren't the target audience for it.  It proved to be overly detailed in procedure and mechanics and fairly static (understandable at this scale, I suppose), and not much fun.  Graphically, it's the most impressive game I will probably ever see, simply amazing.  Although it's easy to find criticisms with some of the details, we can't fault the designers for our disappointment in the game, it's just us. I enjoyed the anticipation of playing while spending endless hours cutting/clipping/sorting counters more than I did the actual game.

Perhaps like an old exotic car, a game to be more admired than driven.  Unfortunately, the game is OOP as of July, 2005.

Just 2 things to keep this out of my wishlist: 1.  The huge size box 2. the non-NATO military counters.  Otherwise, this is a huge game with real investment in gaming time and space as well.  I do want to buy this though.  Someday, I will get a larger house.  But then, it might have been through to the 6th edition.....

Great yet really really big.  Not quite as satisfying as the first edition... it's tougher to kill units, but gives you the gritty feel of clawing your way through the rubble.  The rules are not so complicated, you just need a big chart with all the modifiers and you're good to go.

I was seduced by the components.  Never punched it, much less played it.  Way too monstrous for my increasingly scarce free time.  Sold it to someone as a play copy and bought several games in return that are more likely to see play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Have played some of the scenarios, but I'm afraid the campaign will be always beyond my time and space. Combat is, I would say, pretty heavy and procedural, a throwback to the '70s. (No surprise, since the design is from the '70s) Rules could be tighter. Counters are quite nice, and setup cards are huge and beautiful - nice physical production all around. 

As far as these monsters go, I would rather play 'The Devil's Cauldron', if I had the opportunity to play the whole campaign. Once in the city, this is very attritional, and not super exciting to play. (Realistic, perhaps...)

One observation: the box for this is the biggest wargame box I own - slightly longer and considerably thicker than The Devil's Cauldron. There is plenty of room for counter trays.

I'll have to hold off rating this version until I get a chance to play it, but I did play the Nova Games edition many years ago and had quite a bit of fun.

As mentioned above, the "Wow!" factor is pretty high and certainly rates a 10 for its graphics. Every item in the box is top-notch from the quality of the paper used for the various components, to the wonderful and tasteful use of color. This game is definitely a labor of love and should serve as an example of how to do it right.

Do NOT let the lack of NATO military symbols put you off this game! It's really not that hard to learn the historically accurate symbols, and in many cases, they seem quite intuitive.

This is a game in which to immerse yourself in the situation and the graphics and historical information provided make this an enjoyable -- if potentially very time consuming -- experience.

P.S: The "box fart" factor here is huge, the loudest ever! In fact, it scared my cat!

RATING: 8
As someone who owns and has played the original, I ask myself "Is this game better than the original game?". For me, the answer is yes and no. Yes, in that the gratuitous die rolling is gone (although there is still a lot of that here too) and the combat results is more nuanced. No, in that the sequence of play is more procedural than intuitive (like the original game) and the balance of most of the scenarios (including the campaign game) in biased toward the Russians.

Does it replace the original? For me, I would say no because of the reasons I mentioned. However, the graphics of this version are much better than the original (having the superior designations on the backs of the counters alone make this a better game, graphically). I'm fortunate enough to own both copies and will keep them in my collection.

I rate the original a 10 and this version an 8 because I find the original version easier to teach and it plays through faster (although, with all the die rolling) it is not THAT much faster!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Outstanding game.  I think I'd rate this higher if I'd been able to play it more so far.  Components are among the best I've seen.  The rules seem thick, but the play aids work great and after you've played thru a turn or 2 everything seems to fall into place very well.  The CRT will force you to truly commit to a fight (arty, combined arms) or pay the price.  Game play can be depressing for the Russians )as you get shredded) until you pull the Germans into the city.  I haven't found any downsides to gameplay / system, but be prepared to invest some hearty gametime and space to get the full feel for the game.

--

12/3/09 Update : lowering from 8 to 7 after playing the campaign game again.  Nothing wrong with the game per se, but the generally boring Russian position of taking a consistent beating and the agony of counting all those artillery factors drags down the enjoyment of an otherwise great game.

I acquired this game in september2012. I was looking for a detailed company or battalion game on the battle of Stalingrad. The game is rather rare and expensive, but after playing scenario 1, I think it was worth every bit I payed for it. This is a game I will enjoy for a long time to come.

Diamond of my collection. Some day... It's to pretty to punch. I've decided to make counters when it comes time to play this monster, or get a punched game. Recent News; Got a partially punched game. I find it difficult to play. With 80 or so different turn sequences for each player to do every turn. This is a monster in all sense of the word! This would be a game to be stranded on an Island with, if you had plenty of food and drink for several months. LOL!

RATING: 2
I clearly don't have the tolerance for excessive 'realism' rules in wargames any longer, compared to when I was 20 years younger. We tried setting it up to play, and we spun our wheels.  The historical information contained within is fascinating. And it's quite well produced from a component standpoint. But it felt completely unplayable.

On the spectrum of 'simulation' to 'ease of play', it leans FAR too far toward the former for me to find it fun.

Definitive treatment of the vital struggle to win the famous city.  Game is very detailed and a blast to play.  This version has the best maps, counters and materials yet.  Both sides have to "make it count" at every moment. Simple system makes for easy start and plenty of enjoyment.  Not only does it play well, it feels right. This game is a gem and deserves the reputation as a playable monster and epic.

RATING: 8
Probably the ultimate game covering the battle of Stalingrad at street level. Does turn into meat grinder once the city proper is entered. Quite a complex turn sequence that will take at least one game to get a feel for the flow and some of the subtleties involved for each of the sides. The rule book would benefit from a few illustrations to break up the text. There are some extremely useful play aids out there, I particularly recommend the combat drm table. It's a monster game, make no mistake it will take a very long time to play and even the smaller scenarios could quite easily fill a casual weekend's gaming. Once in the city it becomes a grind as the German player seeks to maximise his available attack factors and the Russian desperately tries to delay the German advance. Some nice touches in the rules regarding snipers, mine dogs, leaders and fog of war. VASSAL module is good but you will need to do a little editing if you intend to solitaire the game. I would challenge those who describe this game as unplayable. It is very playable but does take time to play.

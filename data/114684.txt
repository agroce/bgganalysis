A fun little card game with cute graphics. It's pretty fun to challenge your opponent to a duel and steal cards from them.

RATING: 3
Can be fun with lots of players but falls flat at 2. Lots of rules ambiguity. It's essentially just a set collection game but it gets at least a 4 for managing to have some odd strategies at times that force you to really think.

Unfortunately, it's tremendously less enjoyable with an AP prone player (something I can normally tolerate).

Also, this showed me just how much I'm not into attacking another person.

Huge fan of this easy-to-play game! The only reason I'm offering it for trade is because I somehow ended up with two copies during the flurry of Kickstarter fulfillment!

Both copies are the 4th Edition (Kickstarter) in the larger box with the power dice. Acquired via Kickstarter.

Excellent city builder. The combat is fun and can be made to be slightly luck driven with the Power Dice expansion. There is a lot of variability between card abilities. Plenty of strategy mixed with some luck of the draw. The option to use hidden cards in combat adds some great risk assessment. The game is also very compact. Since the manual is the size of the cards, everything you need to take the game anywhere can fit nicely into a standard Ultra Pro deck box. Great game with some great expansions already available.

I'm not big on card games where each card has its own individual power. And while the cards may have been balanced, the mechanics weren't. We ended up having round after round of set collection with little or even no player combat. Also pixel artwork is annoying and the components are of poor quality

A rummy style game with added interaction mechanics.  Build villages of cards and attack other villages to steal their good cards.  Played over several rounds until someone hits 100 points.

I absolutely love this game! I think the cards are really good quality. Sure they could be more of a plastic feel like some playing cards, but imho they have a really nice quality similar to the MTG cards. After putting roughly 230+ in sleeves, I never had a single one bend or fold while sliding them in. And the sleeves were custom fit to these cards, so it was a very snug fit! The artwork on the cards is phenomenal. Before this campaign, I was never a real fan of pixel art. But these cards are truly my favorite of any I've seen. The rulebook has thorough rules. (The wiki page also includes much more detailed instructions for the solo play.) The main rulebook gives you the basic concept of how to play the game. One could certainly start a game without having any problems.

The game has several expansions: Distant Lands, Ghost Town, Royalty, and Holidays. Although Royalty and Holiday may not be available on future editions, as they were part of a Kickstarter campaign. I have all additions, and really enjoy adding those to the base game. I've also played the solo version, Village Assault, and find that to be rather enjoyable as well. There are also power dice, both easy and hard, which add some twist to the game making each round different.

RATING: 3
- luck-driven
- rounds end too fast
- too many offensive abilities but too few battles
- terrible card stock quality
- black border cards, bound to get marked card edges

It will provide some easy exploratory plays and has cute artwork, but has no staying power. Played the base game and have no intention of trying out the expansions. Should have been further developed.

Set-collecting card game in which you play multiple units (cards) of the same colour to create "villages", these then score points but are open to attack from the other players - a successful attack then allows you to steal a unit and add it to your village, or simply destroy that unit and score negative points for the defending player.

The idea seems nice on the surface, the cards are bright and colourful and the theme is funny and whimsical.  The problem is that there is almost no strategy to this game whatsoever.  You often simply play the only set of cards you have in your hand (as a set must contain at least 3), and if you aren't lucky enough to have drawn a good defensive card then your opponents will simply attack you and take your good point-scoring cards (which are often defenseless), so your turn regularly results in either scoring points for another player, or scoring yourself negative points.  You replenish your hand from a deck, so no strategy in that either.

This game isn't devoid of fun, and could be great as a filler as it is short - but don't expect to be making many decisions.

Rummy games with a twist always interest me.  Frost has done an interesting job of mixing PvP decisions into a rummy game.

I would caution however that the game lacked any real sense of depth with 6 players.  I recommend keeping it down to 3 or 4.

Really love to have this for the class, but can't justify parting with $20 when Dominion (and or expansions we don't have) is only a few bucks more and offers so much more gameplay (and proven appeal). 

Maybe wait to get it as a donation or in the marketplace. Unfortunately, they would have had me at a $10 kickstarter price. (And for that price I could have bought two or 1 of the expansions).

A little disappointed by the gameplay of the basic game for the 2 player mode.

Too many cards with too many effects, and much focus on combat cards, and yet there's not much decision making or combat involved.

It takes all the luck of rummy - initial draw, cards drawn, what's available on the discard pile - and then chooses to add an extra element of take-that which ends up simply adding another form of luck. Either you can safely attack my meld with your cards, or you can't depending on which cards I happened to draw and therefore happen to be in my meld. You'd think these attack decisions would add an extra layer of decision making, which might be considered a good thing, but it does so at the expense of destroying the goodness of rummy, being the quick play, the manipulation of the discard pile, the choice on what to play/keep/discard based on what the others are doing. Each of our hands seemed to only go a handful of rounds before it was over, so it hardly felt like you'd had a chance to manage your hand before it was over. But each hand also seemed to drag while each player considered their attack options each turn. As a result, this is a long way down my list of preferred rummy-based games.

The good: Easy to learn and play. Theme is appealing. Idea of building villages very cool.
The bad: Low strategy (you are limiting to playing what you have in the immediate), fighting success/failure is too random (especially when face down), card effects rarely get used or change a fight outcome. After a single game of 5 rounds we saw pretty much every card and how they interact with each other - the base game lost its appeal quickly. Played once and that was well enough.

This is a set building game, that has a very nice retro theme (although some people can get put off by the pixel art). It's personally quite enjoyable, and the expansions add to the flavour of the game. I do feel that one needs to be quite specific when building the deck to have good balance amongst all of the colours though, and sometimes it really sucks to get a hand filled with grey cards.

Awesome art. You can explain it to new players in about 10 minutes. We always end up playing several rounds, seems like people really like it :)
Even with only 2 people it can get quite intense...

I made my own PnP pocket version, really handy as there are quite a lot of cards on the table...

RATING: 5.5
Still want to play this more before i score it but my first impressions are that its underwhelming considering the buzz it got on kickstarter.

*Update* having played this a few more times with the expansions the game is more interesting now. The distant lands expansion is good and i wouldnt consider playing this without it now, but the game still feels very luck driven which is not always a bad thing but in a card game I prefer it not to dominate.

*Update* I think this game ended up being a good lesson for myself in Kickstarter games. I went all out on this one with all the stretch goals all just on the look of the game but actually the game just isn't that 'good'. The mechanics are not great and the rules are loose and the cards often unbalanced. Some people will like this type of game (probably those that like Munchkin) but unfortunately not me.

Nice little game, however it is a bit overwhelming with all abilities if you own all the cards like me. It's hard to make fast decisions based on that. As a result we currently play without the abilities (bar key ones like farmer, builder, king etc) with my 5 years old. Works well but it still takes a bit long to finish off a game. I´m not against the pixel art as such (nor I am a fan of it) but after some time it gives me some headache. Still, I find it cool.

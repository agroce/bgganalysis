This copy is my wife's copy. She won it at Ludo-Outaouais's November 2006 edition. The game is Serengeti, by Asmodée, in French.
Our first 2 games were a big surprise, I usually don't like auction mechanism. The game is surprisingly fun, and the theme (with Serengeti) fits well.  I like the African Art theme of the game.

You use Money to collect card sets, but Money always goes back to some players, player who have cards on their play area equal to the number bid get Money. Also you can't bid a number that matches a number of one of your card on your play area.

Interesting auction game with a memory component.  Your bid cannot end in a number (city district) that you have bought into... you are penalized if you make an illegal bid.  When the bidding gets heated, someone is bound to forget his number and lose a buck.  Meanwhile, you get money whenever someone wins an auction with a bid that ends in a number that you own.  For example, if you hold a #7 district, you get money when an opponent's winning bid is 7, 17 or 27.

Juego de cartas, de subastas y hacer colecciones. Se van subastando cartas siguiendo la secuencia 1-2-3. Las cartas son de 6 colores y están numeradas del 1 al 10. Se trata de ir haciendo sets del mismo color (cuantas más tengas más puntos obtendras). Tiene el puntito original de que no puedes hacer subastas que terminen en una cifra de la que tu ya tienes al menos una cuarta. Por ejemplo, si tengo un cuatro, no puedo pujar ni 4, ni 14, etc... eso hace que si tienes muchas cartas tus pujas estén muy condicionadas. El jugador que propone la puja puede decidir si pagar al máximo pujador y quedarse él la carta o que se lo lleve el máximo pujador. En ese caso, el dinero se paga a los que tengan cartas cuya cifra coincida con la ultima cifra del valor pujado. si se adjudica una puja en 15, todos los que tengan 5 reciben el pago. Por lo visto, es exactamente igual al Serengueti, cambiando el tema. Por cierto, el tema, se supone que es mafioso y tal, pero vamos, que no sirve absolutamente para nada. Es un juego sencillote y sin grandes pretensiones, pero para pasar un ratín vale.

Need to play this one again.  Blew my money too early in the first game we played and fell too far behind, but it was a good game.  Rating will likely change on further plays.

RATING: 6
Yet another fun and interesting filler.  The basics are that you're bidding for cards, trying to get large sets of a color (the more of a color you have, the more points that set is worth).

The real kicker here is that not only are the cards colored, they're also numbered.  When you win a card, you can no longer make a bid in subsequent rounds which end in that number.  So, if you have previously won cards numbered 2, 3, 4, and 8, and the guy before you makes a bid of 1, you are forced to up your bid to 5 if you want to stay in the auction, since you're no longer allowed to bid 2-4 (or 8)!

Furthermore, you receive the proceeds from any winning bid for a number you have the most of at the table.  So, if you have two 5's and another player only has one 5, and someone wins a lot with a bid of 5, you receive those 5 bidding tokens.

In the end, if you like bidding, but are looking for a bidding game with a few interesting twists, this one might be for you.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 6 players:

Six does not seem like the ideal number for this game. It's a shame, because I liked it, but nobody else seemed to so it'll be very difficult to play again.

I enjoy the gimmick here. A lot. It leads to some tense (even if they aren't deep) decisions, particularly in the later game.

My one issue with the game is the end felt very anti-climactic. The last two turns were just everyone mathing out who was winning, and who would win, based on the next auctions and money in hand. Little too predictable. Though being able to auction off your own properties certainly helped that a bit.

Also, and this could have just been because six players, it felt a little long. I'd enjoy this at 30 minutes but if it's going to take an hour there's better auction games around.

The luster of the bronze bust I have of Michael Schacht is really starting to dullen.  This one is not great.  I don't like where your lack of choice in the early game, sets you into a path where your middle and later games are decided for you.  I just felt this game was pointless.

RATING: 5
This is a weird little filler auction game. Laughs are certain, as it gets harder and harder to bid due to the rules; you cannot make a bid of for instance two money if you have the majority of 2 cards in play! This makes it a very different auction game. Due to the scoring system and the fact that there are various types of colored cards, each auction will be more valuable for certain players. It was an okay game that I’m willing to play again once or twice, but it’s nowhere near as good as No Thanks, For Sale, Modern Art etc.

This game sports a bidding system similiar to the one in Traumfabrik with an interesting twist. You can't bid an amount that is present on a card you have already won and instead of the bid always being split amongst the players it can go to someone who has a card with the same number as the bid. Capiche?

Un juego de subasta bastante curioso. Es la nueva edición del Don pero con unos cambios en las reglas. Creo que los cambios podrían haber sido mejores pero aún así funciona bien. El objetivo es coger cartas de un mismo tipo como en coloretto solo que en serengeti nunca puntúan negativo.

I have rarely played this cardgame, and to be honest, I find it difficult to remember what happened exactly. I do remember I found it a bit lacklustre, without interesting choices. But I'd have to play again to see why I didn't like it much, to be honest.

[b]Update[/b] Played it a few more times thereafter, even in the original version of Don. I remember playing nearly at random and still coming along in a satisfying way. The bidding restrictions are kinda cute, but they are not able to carry the whole without a hitch.

Neat auction filler game.  

Update: Wow, BGG, when you change the name of the game in the database, at least update the description!  The game I own is Don, about the mafia in Chicago.  Then new title is Serengeti, abut African art or something.  But the BGG description of the African titled game is all about city districts and mobsters.

Very basic auction game with a twist that sounds much better on paper than it actually plays.  The restrictions that develop as you win bids are annoying rather than interesting.  I'm not a huge fan of pure auction games, but I like 'em when they work (like Traumfabrik or the original version of For Sale).  This game just left a sour taste in my mouth.  Those with a higher tolerance for crappy chaotic bidding mechanisms might enjoy it more.

Extra negative anti-bonus points for the blatant Godfather ripoff artwork, which only magnified the disappointment.

Clever auction game with high weird factor. Thirty cards are auctioned off in 15 lots of one, two or three card sets. Players bid chips to pick up these lots. Now comes the weird part - you cannot bid an amount that matches the numbers on cards you already own, and, the player(s) who own cards that match the winning bid divide up the bid payment. The winner after the 15 auctions is the player with the most points, points being awarded based on building large sets of cards of a colour. After a game or two is begins to make sense. Purchase too much and you restrict your bidding options but rake in the lucre.

Another interesting, decently fast auction game. Loses a point because the bidding takes a couple seconds to think about. 

7 to 6: This game forces AP onto even some AP resistant players, there is a lot to factor for a modest payout. Consider picking up if you really like auction fillers and you already have High Society, Scripts and Scribes, and For Sale, but you're still interested in more light auction games.

This is a light auction card game with interesting payout and bid restrictions. You can't bid a number you have previously won, but if someone makes a bid that is the number on one of your cards, you get the money.  Therefore a player needs to place a bid that will distribute the money to as many players as possible. 

Easy to learn, plays in 20-30 mins. The theme is irrelevant.  The cards in this Serengeti version are beautiful.  Bruno Faidutti lists this as one of his top games of the year.

I was excited about the strategy of bidding and played 5 games in a row and tired of it.  Still, it is a good filler game.

Rating based on one play; may rise if I am suitably impressed next time I play, but is more likely to fall.  I am always suspicious of games with unusual auction mechanisms that I win first time out...
Update 17FEB05:  Rating dropped to a 6; not a bad game but the winner is kind of predictable after the first few auctions.  The biggest problem I have with this game is the ease with which a player can be kept out of the running.

Simple auction game with a twist, but what a twist! As you earn cards, you restrict the numbers you can bid and often end up needing to pay more than what a lot is worth. However, having a specific denomination can earn you more money than what you would usually get. It's twisted all right. Still, it works quite well and ask you to balance between early earnings and lack of flexibility or late come-back with less choice for your cards. My first 3 player game ended as a 3-way tie!

A little bit too twisted (in the "I can not bid 4 because I heve a 4-card, but if I bid 5 he will get all my money, let me bid 6 so they will have to split it!" way) for my taste. 
I should maybe try it with only 3-4 players to see if it gets more controllable.

Initial Rating 8.0 (January 2011)

A fun light game, I prefer the gangster themed Don but Serengeti is ok too. The score is reminiscent of Coloretto. This is a good game to show to your non-gaming friends, easy to teach, short playtime and fun. I love auction games and Serengeti has some twists integrated during the auction making it unique to the extent of my knowledge.

Nowadays I don´t want to play it as much as before but it stills hit the table with some frequency.

It’s been years since I last played Serengetti. My desire to do so is almost zero. I sold my copy of the game and I’m downgrading its rating. This is a perfect example of how my gaming taste have been changing over the years. I no longer want to play lighter games (there are some exceptions). My GF and I almost always prefer heavy Euro Games.

Serengeti may just be the most clever bidding game I've yet to play.  I love how when players gain a card, their bid can no longer end in the number displayed.  As the game plays on, this can really change how bids may normally have gone.  Also, payouts work in an amazing way, which again makes people think twice about their bids, hoping not to pay out their entire bid to one player.  It fits the same niche as a game like No Thanks! and shares (or may even excel) in having a very clever mechanic to keep the bidding interesting throughout.

RATING: 6
I am really a sucker for auction games, and this one is good. The mechanic that is fresh (to me) in this game is how the cards bring both good and bad. The colors of the cards determine points, and the values of the cards determine "income." However, the values also limit the flexibility of your subsequent bids. This creates a very interesting trade-off as you consider your bids and whether or not you should go after the cards that are up for bid. The theme is a bit weak, but there are times where you feel like you are struggling against another player for control of either a color or a value. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
No theme except for the box artwork - why even bother?  The bidding system is very unusual and unique, but I'm not sure the whole thing works.  You must really pay attention to your bids or there can be wild, imbalancing swings when tons of chips get moved over to just one player.  There seems to be a runaway leader problem, but maybe we just need more experience.

I could almost rate this game "broken". Thing is, for incomes, you are totally at the mercy of what others bid and it is possible that you will never get any more money for the rest of the game, hence preventing you from overbidding the others and getting cards that could help.

Innovative game, I'm just not sure it's fun enough. While it has a typical Michael Schacht bidding/scoring cardgame feel, it's a bit like a game by Leo Colovini to me - most Colovinis are innovative but dry and not fun. 
I like the ideas here - the way you are more and more restricted and how each bid means different for everyone and each lot is worth different for anyone, also how differently the bids are going to be shared amongst the other players. So it's really an interesting idea; still I'm not sure I would publish it as a publisher (unless a well-known name like Michael Schacht is the designer).
I wouldn't say no to playing it again but am not really impressed.

Only played once. Two word to describe this game : fiddly and clever. Since there is no theme and the gameplay is awkward I'm not sure it's a really good game. Rules are kind of strange. At first it's not easy to know what you are doing and who you are helping. Important things to remember : in the first few turn don't let the pot becomes too big! If it does the one who'll win it will have a too big advantage for the rest of the game.

Excellent bidding game, great with games and non-gamers alike. Players bid for cards not only to win the game but also to win more bidding tokens later!

Nice auction mechanic, plays very fast, but is kinda trumped by Mogul, also from Schacht.

A neat little bidding game with highly restrictive rules.  Not a bad filler.  I would not recommend this for 6 players.  With 3 it's a tight bidding game, with 6 it is too easy for one or more players to get locked out. (And by "locked out" I mean sitting there with nothing to do for the majority of the game, out of money and with no way to collect more.)

To reiterate.  3>4>5>6

Neat, light bidding game. I like the mechanics where you cannot bid on numbers that you own, but receive money if someone else bids that number. I also like the fact if you collect several cards of the same colour (to score lotsa points), you will end up with many numbers you cannot bid, which restricts your options. However the endgame felt a little out of whack as a lot of money can change hands in the blink of an eye, while the player on the receiving end hasn't done anything especially "smart" or srategic to receive it except happen purchase the right-numbered card in an earlier round.

What an interesting idea for a bidding game.  If a winning bid's "ones" digit matches a card in front of you, you get the money from the auction.  And you can't bid anything that ends in a ones digit that you have sitting in front of you.  So, as your collection of cards grows, you have a more limited number of options for what you can bid, even as you are collecting a lot of money.  If it were any longer, it wouldn't be as fun, but this can be played even with 5-6 players in maybe thirty minutes.  Perfect for this kind of game.

Simple little closed economy auction game. Don't like 'em in the main, and that includes Traumfabrik. This one's twisted because it's an auction game that works better with fewer players, and it only takes one, maybe 2, key kingmaker auctions (out of 15) to decide the game. And you'll either have the cash you need for the set that comes up, or not. Or you'll receive the cash you need from someone else's auction win, or not.

It seems that in every game someone gets frozen out without the ability to bid, either thorugh their combination of cards won or a lack of funds.

The basics are pretty bland - cards are auctioned off in randomly-determined lots of 1, 2 or 3 and you get points for collecting coloured sets. The ‘twist’ is that each card also has a number and once you own a number, you can’t bid that amount in future auctions. What’s more, it’s a closed economy (like Hollywood Blockbuster) and your bid goes to the player who owns most cards of the number you bid. This makes for some interesting decisions during the bidding rounds, but unfortunately the game seems to be ultimately determined more by which cards get turned up together.

Interesting bidding game here - the closed money system and how it is redistributed is neat.  Based on the couple times I've played, the game's sweet spot may be slightly less than a full six players.  Good game, based on two plays with six players.

nice idea and a decent filler BUT not sure its optimally realised - wld like to see the mech used in a smaller way in a bigger game rather than being the whole game but def worth a look - felt v 'knizia'

rating after 2nd play (5pl) - 6/7 - prob best with 4 - was fun but end was determinative

uptade - 6 - i like it but the endgame is v determinative and not sure bout the side auction thing

Not right for everyone as it takes a bit of time to wrap one's head around the auction mechanism.  But game plays relatively quickly with a bit of thought, so enjoyable there.  But suspect it takes a few plays to appreciate how the money flows around in the game.  Trouble is...with the cold reaction by some who don't get it...will it be played enough to learn to play it well.

RATING: 5
With 5, the game really didn't work.  There were several players who clearly couldn't win for a good chunk of the game -- while they may have been able to avoid being in that position with better play, I suspect that 1-2 players will always end up in that position, which is unfortunately.  I think the problem is a positive feedback issue -- gaining cards has a small drawback and a moderate gain (prior to scoring) so the rich get richer.

I'd like to try it with 3, as it might be much better that way.

Lastly, this game has the worst theme integration I have ever seen in a game.  It is a comically poor match.  Not a big deal but what were they thinking !?!?

An interesting mechanic, but ultimately there's always at least one player who feels the control has completely eluded them and feels frustrated because of it. There's luck in the timing of having money ready when the right cards turn up. Still, I appreciate it for the interesting mechanic and reasonably quick playing time.

Relatively easy(easy to play, not easy to win!) auction game.  Moves quickly, and is over quickly.  Half of us liked it, half weren't so crazy about it.  I think the ones who didn't like it thought it was too "tame".

RATING: 5
Quick auction and set-collection game in a closed economy, with a trademark Schacht kink thrown in, as the winning bid can be transmitted to only one or a few players. The more you win, the more handicapped your bidding options become, but the more points you get, and the more likely you are to gain income.

A lot of leeway for forging alliances and making crafty bids. Need to play a couple more times to understand the game.

Most ridiculous presentation award goes to this one. It is a simple game of numbered coloured cards with coins for points...and it's rather good. I've always enjoyed playing this but we always have a discussion about the theme and coins. It comes in a box that contains some good cards but is two thirds full with oversized bright orange plastic coins. The box has Godfather imagery but the cards have no supporting theme just being numbers and colours (which is fine as they are easy to read) so the theme is even less than pasted on. So, I like the game but the way it is sold is ludicrous.

Played this in its Serengeti incarnation. Serengeti is a rather overlooked light auction game with strange constrictions. Players bid for cards, with a catch – you may not bid a value which corresponds to a value you already own, but you also get a share of the winning bid if it corresponds to a value you own. Oh, and those values don't matter in the end; the scoring depends on the coloured sets you've managed to collect.

The duality of values and cards requires players to rethink conventional approaches to auctions. For example, it may occasionally make sense to bid cash you don't have in hope that the winning bid settles on a value you own. (I've done this twice; I succeeded the first time and had my bluff called the second time.) All these quirks add up for an oddly satisfying play experience.

However, there are times when the constrictions backfire. In particular, it's possible for players to deliberately skip bidding certain values so as to shaft early leads, which is a problem more evident in 5P games. Serengeti is not the most accessible or exciting game of its kind, but definitely worth a try if you're already deep into the genre anyway.

RATING: 8.5
A very demented auction game with a unique twist.

The theme is pasted on: players are mob bosses trying to bid on coloured suits numbered 0-9. The tricky thing is that players CANNOT bid amounts on the cards they own. If they do, they have to pay 1 gold to the pot as a penalty.

Also, the winning bid amount is paid to the person who owns the card/s with the winning bid number. Yes, it's truly demented.

Hence, the more cards you have, the harder it is to make bids. More points are scored for sets of similar colour. Bonus points for those with the most money too.

This game has enough to be rubbing shoulders with the auction greats: For Sale and High Society. Superb filler.

Serengeti version.

It's like a streamlined Traumfabrik. Unfortunately, the theme is not nearly as engaging (although this does play quickly).

[b]Rules[/b]
- There are 6 colors of 5 cards each, numbered 0 - 9 (various distribution for each color)
- Everyone starts with 12 coins
- Each round, reveal cards a lot of cards to auction; # cards in lot rotates 1-2-3-1-2-3 etc
- Players bid coins until all but one passes = winner. Bid is illegal if it ends in a digit D that is shown on any card that player has already won. Winner pays money to the other players that have previously won cards showing digit D according to the ratio of the # of D cards they own. Any remainders are returned to the bank. Players who pass at the first chance (i.e., without bidding at all) take 2 coins from the bank.
- Bid winner makes first bid on next round
- After 15 rounds (30 cards auctioned), final scoring: 
  * 2 points to player(s) with most money left
  * For each color, get 1 - 3 - 6 - 10 - 15 points if you have 1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 cards in that color
- Most points wins!

Wow, I had never heard of Don before playing it and I love the mechanics.  I wish there were a few more cards in the deck, maybe one or two more per color.  Also, maybe the rule should be you can still bid for a number you have as long as you're not leading or tied for the lead in that number.  Those are minor complaints for a gem that was at least hidden from me!

Own Serengeti version--wow what a fun, innovative bidding dance this is!  This is bidding distilled down to its most basic essence...there is literally nothing else in the game as players wage a war to gather the relics they need for the sets their building while trying to avoid cramping their ability to bid effiently (beware locking out a string of bidding numbers!).

[Queens game 2nd (2001) edition] {Mafia, filler; auction, set collection} Don is an auction game with some twist - players are restricted to bid on some value based on the card they collected. Since the money is circulated within the players, it's not good to overbid in Don.  Don is vulnerable to run-away leader problem, esp. with new players.  Some players are virtually eliminated in mid game due to the cash flow mechanic (when they did not get enough cards in early game).

It's fast-paced and simple. The art work is dull but the chips are very handy. The game costs only USD3.00. It's a real bargain.

[Rule] The 'side auction' rule is confusing. It seems that only ONE card can be auctioned each around (among all players) and the normal auction restrictions apply.

Interesting game, but your chance of winning is largely determined by the other players. If one player messes up it pretty much hands the game to one person, which can be annoying. Would be better if there was something else to the game that wasn't heavily based on other player's actions.

I love this game.  That it starts off easy, but gets more and more challenging as it becomes more and more limiting shows how some very simple rules can create a very interesting game narrative.  It also leads to some tasty ARGH! moments where you realize that your carefully laid plans went south by taking the wrong card.  Avoid playing it with 3 or 6 players (the bids develop in such a way as to continually force the same player to drop out each turn), but with 4 or 5, it's a great, brain-burning little filler.

Funky auction game that doesn't seem to work right with six (based on my one play), but is quite enjoyable with three and four. With six, players who don't get a stake in the action early are slowly cut out of auctions funds. With fewer players, you have a better chance of winning an auction, which then fuels you for later rounds. The bidding restrictions and directed payments force players into interesting situations.

Nice minimalist auction game, but perhaps too minimalist. It's a straight-up set collection with auctions to acquire the cards, with exactly one twist. It's kind of a clever twist, but I'm not convinced it adds enough to the game on its own. I keep meaning to give this game another spin, but it never seems to make it back to the table.

Also, I have the Serengeti version, and I hate the inclusion of the giant plastic money tokens, which seem to be there only to justify a bigger box and a higher MSRP. They should really be about half the size, and the box too.

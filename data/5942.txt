GAME: Mystery Rummy: Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld
RANK: 1867

RATING: 7
A very fun and nice-looking Rummy card game.  Probably the second best in the series behind jack the Ripper.  Mini-bios on the gangsters is a nice touch.

Excellent and fast paced once everyone knows how to play.  We had a great time with the game with players ranging in age from 12 to 52.

Beautiful balance in the decisions of which sets to seek, when to play them and when to hold them in your hand. I think the gavel cards are the best set in the Mystery Rummy series (yet).

Pretty good with three. Thought I had a shut-out but I was lacking one Al Capone card. Grr.

RATING: 6.9
Perhaps the least deviation from standard Rummy of all the games in this line, Al Capone is a solid play and easy to pick up. The differences are higher scoring total, and the set scoring bonuses you can throw down to get there, kind of thematic with that whole 'gang' thing. Also, the Gavel cards are cool in how they probe the 'Underworld', i.e. the discard deck. Not the best of the series, not the worst.

I like em all, but this has become my favorite of the bunch.  Have back up deck now.  Okay, increased to a 10.  The gavel cards really allow you to plan and make bold plays.

No love for Frank.

Took 31 plays but I played a four player game (everyone against each other).  Really good that way too.  It is VERY hard to get a shut out but the gavel cards become huge in the game.  It really made for creative play.

Another fine Mystery Rummy game, but I haven't enjoyed this one nearly as much as I liked Jack the Ripper or Wyatt Earp.  I've only played two-player though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting rummy variant.  Some good tension is generated in the 4-player partnership game since you can only use your actions (e.g. melding or discarding certain colors) to communicate with your partner (i.e. no table talk).  Some of the gavel cards are very powerful in this version of MR... one is "agent meeting" and I can't remember the name of the other one.  They let you steal partial sets (or cards-in-hand) from your opponents.  These cards are so overpowering (forcing players to get lucky with card draws) that I'm a bit turned off by this MR game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Comparing this to MR#1: Jack the Ripper, I definitely like Ripper better, at least as a two-player game.

Our 2-player games of Capone quickly turn into a card-hoarding fest - don't lay any melds down until you're all but ready to go out, because at least that way your opponent has to guess what you're collecting for most of the game when trying to steal cards from you.

Fun, but not as much fun as Ripper, which just seems a little more strategic - or at least, you want to play cards early in the hand rather than all at once. Overall a good purchase, though.

Of all the Mystery Rummies, this one feels the most "normal."  It doesn't really feel all that different from a rummy that you can play with a standard deck of cards.  I would rather play the others in the series.

RATING: 5
I don't care much for this incarnation of Mystery Rummy.  It's not bad, just not as interesting as the prior games (OK, Jekyll & Hyde wasn't very good either).  It might be more fun with more than 2 players because the gavel cards will have more potency then.  As a 2-player game, it is strictly "OK".

RATING: 4
this is Rummy with some added convolutions. The theme is nearly nonexistant in that I played the game without reading the flabvour text or even being drawn to and barely even read the names of the characters. The theme was not strong enough to hide the fact that you are just drawing cards hoping to find a set of the same colour.

Mostly enjoyable as a partnership game with four, which is how I've mostly played it.  Again, the gavel cards offer nice variation and flexibility to the gameplay.  Coordinated teamwork really isn't possible; any time you can help your partner seems to be dumb luck.  But not a bad game.

Another very good rummy game from Mike Fitzgerald.  It is a simpler game than Jack the Ripper and Wyatt Earp, so this would be a good introduction to the Mystery Rummy series.  The cards look great but are too thick which makes the cards HARD to shuffle. :(  On the good side, after you play a game of Al Capone, all other cards seems incredibly easy to shuffle! :)  It is one of my favorite 3 player games.

Jack the Ripper is best with two players.
The difference between JtR and the others, is there is a guessing element to the game. At one point, you may make a gamble on who is Jack - if you are correct you get points.
That is nowhere else in the MR games.
Jekyll and Hyde - is strictly a two player game.
Rue Morgue - is good with partners
Al Capone - is Canasta-like
Bonnie and Clyde - is umm... not the best in the series.
Escape from Alcatraz - can be a bit more complicated and confusing.

One of the more simple Mystery Rummy games.  Players are melding gangsters with bonus points awarded for complete sets.  A set of Al Capone&#039;s is a shutout.  Cards can be stolen from the hand or table.  Fast, simple, works well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This Mystery Rummy game feels the least formulaic than any of the other in the series.  The reason for this is that you draw 2 cards per turn (like Wyatt Earp), winning score is 200+, you don't score any negative points for cards in hand at the end of a round, and you can take cards from your opponents.  While the effort is ambitious I think this is my least favorite of the Mystery Rummy games (unless you include Wyatt Earp) however I still like playing it for variety and it might well be your favorite if you give it a try.  The only thing I would give this game over Jack the Ripper is that it actually plays well with four people.

Our second in the Mystery Rummy series after Jekyll and Hyde.   Preventing complete melds is as much a part of the strategy as making them.  There seems to be some real art in using the gavel cards.  The raid card is particularly nasty and should always be watched out for.  Great fun.

* Played 10+ times. Though I like the idea of Mystery Rummy, I passed on the first 3 games because of the dark sense of macabre in the artwork. With this release -- and a Chicago mob theme -- I was only too happy to pick it up. The added bonus: partnership with 4 players. [[update]] Had a chance to try 2 players and I like it. Familiar for rummy fans, but more to it, without messing it up. Fits theme well enough, and the decisions about what to discard to mislead another player, when to hold a card instead of playing off a meld makes for great rummy spinoff. Much cheaper than Wyatt Earp, I think this game is a keeper and probably a great wife game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this game but it is very simple.  Good for kids, even my seven year old can play.  I would advise you to pick up Wyatt Earp instead because it feels like a more interesting game.  I do like the series and hope to buy all the Mystery Rummy games.  The rules are so streamlined that the game may feel bland.

Update:  Our families most played card game.  This thing keeps getting played, my daughters like it for it's simplicity and brief rules.  Wyatt Earp never sees the light of day.

Another great game in the Mystery Rummy series. This one adds set bonus points for collecting all of one gangster. Sets have different counts. There are gavel cards that allow you abilities to grab what you need to complete a set. Al Capone trumps all and with a complete set you shut out opponent. My copy is damaged from shipping and has some marked cards but still fun.

I am enjoying this game.  The 4 player makes for a different "feel" than the 3 or the 2 player, but its all good.  It is a nice complement to the family of mystery games I now have.  For a moment I thought of getting a card shuffing machine for the largish quantity of cards, but it is easily managed with other players at the table helping out.  We are still learning it but it was a good buy for me and the family.

RATING: 8
My favorite of the Mystery Rummy series... as it's based in the Canasta family. You are forced to hide cards in your hand, on the table & even in the Underworld (the discard pile) to keep your opponent from making complete melds.

WARNING: do NOT play this with 3 players - it's much better for 2 players or 4 players as partners. (If you do ignore my advice, at least reduce the winning score total to 100.)

Initial rating after 2 plays with 2 players. The game is much better than I thought it would be, and my wife really enjoys it too. It's clever, well thought-out, and easy to learn. I would imagine the game would scale very well to 3 or 4 players. A 4-player partners game might be particularly good. It's just about right on the luck factor for my tastes (some luck, but not to the point of distraction or annoyance).

Yes, the cards are a bit too thick, but that's more desirable than being too thin, and hopefully they will break in a little with time.

Al Capone is easily the most unique of the Mystery Rummies I've played.  It has a pronounced Canasta feel and scales quite well for more than two players.  There's also an interesting meta game of chicken involved, where holding back can be more advantageous than playing out what you have.  I think this is the best game in the series in terms of room for skillful play and decreased luck factor.  It's not quite as dynamic or exciting as the others though, so take what you will from that.

Sep08: Riiight.  This is in the same series as Jack the Ripper?  Oiy.  I will *not* be searching the others out.  This is a rummy game with *eleven* suits.  And you only get big rewards if you complete a suit.  Mainly it's just a formula for frustration.  Even a complete set of "gavel" cards that do nothing but help complete sets can help this game for me.

Also, it's missing the whole tension of the Ripper.  In the ripper, you want to kill hookers for cards, but you don't want to kill too many or the ripper will escape!  There's none of that give and take here in Al Capone.

(BTW, thanks for sending this my way Ben.  I did enjoy the chance to try it.)

Great Rummy variation, lots of chances to catch up and to get screwed! This doesn't seem to be the popular pick for best of the mystery rummy series but I don't see how it isn't.  I've played all four in the series plus Wyatt Earp MANY times each. In my opinion this one just SHINES, especially after you've played it a few times and begin really exploring the potential and limitations of the gavel cards.  This gets my HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION in the mystery rummy series.

RATING: 7
* Kickstarted with #5! *

Fourth in the series, it's the same as the other rummy games: draw a card, possibly play one gavel or lay down melds, and then discard, counting points when someone has no cards left. The catch this time is added points if you collect all the cards of one person... unless you get Capone, then only you collect points. 2-4 players, though 4 is team play.

PLUS: easy to learn, use of history
MINUS: much of it is luck in the draw
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I was amazed at the horrible quality of the cards.  Too thick by far, makes rifle shuffling the entire deck impossible.  Strange.  Gameplay is fun, though.  On the third play the strategies began to reveal themselves, and the fun factor increased dramatically.  Simple, yet there are some tough choices to make.  The family will like it.

Plays best with 3 or 4.

RATING: 8.5
Al Capone and the Chicago Underworld is my second try at the Mystery Rummy games and it's another winner in my book.  While it doesn't have as much going on as Escape from Alcatraz did, it still adds enough to separate it from rummy and to make it it's own game away from other entries in the series.  I'm a fan!

I am quite happy to play the first three games any time, but Capone just left me cold. I don't like the mechanism of being able to steal from other people's melds or hand, but that may be your cup of tea, and if so, this may be your favorite. Just not mine.

By far the simplest of all of the Mystery Rummy games. This is the only one where there are no special 'Tuesday Only' rules; everything you need to know is written on the cards themselves, with very little rereading of the rules during play.

Another good Mystery Rummy game.  I&#039;ve got one BIG complaint, though.  I actually cut my fingers shuffling those cards!  Beautiful?  Yes.  Practical?  No!  The deck is so large and the cards so thick that it&#039;s impossible to mix them without splitting it in half. (Yeah, yeah, I know it&#039;s not that big a deal...I just like complaining).

My wife and I like it, just like the other Mystery Rummy games we have played.  This one is simpler than Jekyll & Hyde or Escape from Alcatraz in the mechanics, very straightforward actually, but it still has enough to think about and make it entertaining.  Of the three MR games I've played, this is the easiest to introduce to new players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rating only for 2p; I could it going up after trying the 4p partnership game. I like the fact that you can steal your opponent's layoffs; this adds great angst in deciding whether to play a layoff, discard it, keep it in your hand (but then you won't score points for it if your opponent goes out)... I also really like the interaction of the action (gavel) cards with the game; Elliott Ness and Search Warrant both add very interesting strategic elements and add much colour/nuance in trying to determine which card to keep and which one to discard. 
Update: Raised rating .5 after playing 4p. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I rather enjoyed this.  The special cards aren't too riduculous -- they make you want to hold cards longer than usual so they don't get stolen.  Like the set collection bonuses and that you can shoot the moon with 10 Capone's.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is essentially Rummy (victory is achieved by whomever has the most points in melds at the end of the game), but the point-generating cards are people instead of suits/numbers, and there are four additional cards mixed in that give special powers (steal cards from other players' hands, steal cards from other players melded cards, search the deck, etc.).  The special-power cards make the game much more strategic/tactical than standard Rummy, which is good.  My mom loves Rummy, and so I plan to play this more with her when she's around.

I've only played this as a two-player game; it seems like it'd make a great three-player game too.

For me one of the best games in the Mystery Rummy series. Players need to make melds using the different gang leaders of the time. Not for everyone though as scoring to 200 points makes this a longer game than any of the others.

RATING: 8
One of the simpler games in the Mystery Rummy series, but for some reason, I dig this one quite a bit. The only thing that really sets this one apart from the rest is going for complete sets to score extra points, but it just seems to really click with me. Part of that is the theme. I'm a sucker for a good game with a gangster theme, and this is definitely one of those. The scoring threshold, if you follow the rules, is higher than the other games in the series, so that's something you have to be prepared for, but the game is light, breezy, and a lot of fun.

In the mold of Battleline you collect sets and have cards that can change the gameplay which is brings new life to rummy.  The cards are well illustrated and include wonderful historical notes but I just felt I would have enjoyed myself more with another game for 45 minutes or so.  I would prefer Battleline and don't play that often.  That being said I think this would capture a market of players who know and enjoy rummy.

Mystery Rummy is basically Rummy with a new card type that allows for more draws, specific card searches, or to steal from opponents. This doesn't mean its a bad game, in fact, I prefer it to regular Rummy because of the new cards. Plus, I'm sick of looking at regular playing cards.

The game has beautiful production value, but the cards are so stiff that it makes shuffling difficult. I must say that I would have preferred if the cards had actual photos (even if black and white only) rather than the illustrations of the gangsters.

Mystery Rummy replaced Lost Cities in the light 2-player card game department because it has less confusing endgame math.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

A rummy game with lots of suits. Not enough added value or fun factor compared to a plain vanilla deck of cards. Especially since the game is too long.

This is a great rummy game with normal rummy game play...except. Instead of setting out normal sets of 3 or more matching cards, you are trying to collect a complete set of gangster cards! Sets of gangsters have anywhere from 4 to 8 card sets you try to collect. And if you do collect a complete set, then you get big points! Great historical info. on each card!

When wanting to play a 2 player game, we drift towards card games where the game flows smoothly and quickly. The decision tree here is simple, there's a bit of a memory element, but not too much (and cards you can use to riffle thru the discard pile and remind yourself what's in there anyway), and there's the always present rummy tension of when to meld and when to hold. This version of Mystery Rummy adds danger to melds and layoffs in 2 ways - firstly, unless there are less than 3 cards left unmelded, your own meld may be stolen by someone else who melds the rest and steals yours with a Raid card, and secondly, if you lay off after someone else melds, you risk them stealing your layoffs and completing a set. There's no negatives for holding cards, so the new decision is whether to risk playing early and having cards stolen or how late do you play to ensure they score but limiting the risk of being stolen. The big points come when you collect all cards of a set, so now it also may be worthwhile not to go out even if you can if you're close to scoring your bonuses. They're all nice elements to play with and they provide a point of variance from the others in the series.

Fun, quick, rummy game.  Plays like real rummy except the different suits are named for gangsters, there are different numbers of cards in each suit, and there are 4 special cards that allow you to steal or otherwise uncover cards.  Very good game.  I don't like traditional card games (Diamonds/Spades/Hearts/Clubs) but I enjoy this game with 10 different suits of varying #s of cards, and special cards that add a bit of skullduggery to the game play.

This is very similar to Wyatt Earp.  Some of the gavel cards are very similar to the sheriff cards in Wyatt Earp, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I enjoyed the game, and getting a shutout is a hard accomplishment (which I did not achieve).  Good game, will definitely be playing again.

Played as a three player game this only gets about a 5 ranking. The game goes too quickly to rally up too much strategy. It really is better as a two player game.

This game was not what I was expecting based on comments I'd read.  The "mystery" theme is very thin.

Also, while the cards are high quality, they are too thick and stiff to shuffle well.

By far the weakest entry into the mystery rummy series.  Still, I like rummy and would be willing to play this, but the others are much more interesting.

While I think that the Mystery Rummy games are well done, they just don't apeal to my sensibilities.  So far from the games in this series that I've played this is the best.

That said I would never ask for it, nor would I play it unless someone REALLY wanted to or if there were no other worthwhile games around.

Simpler Mystery Rummy game with different size sets to collect. The special cards are simple to use and lead to picking up the strategies quite quickly.

Unfortunately, the shutout rule leads to an issue in the 2-player game where the player who grabs the first Al Capone meld and plays an Agent Meeting to go with it generally wins because they can take their time collecting other sets and maximising their score while the other player has to race to go out before the Al Capone set is complete. I imagine this is less of a problem in 3- and 4-player games, however.

RATING: 7
[U.S. Games 2003 edition] {couple, gangster; partnership, rummy-variant; best 2vs2} MR4 is quite different from MR1 and MR3. Similar to other MR games, it's tactical and thematic. It's more interactive and nastier than the previous episodes. It's more engaging due to the Al Carpone shut-out. After a team played all 8 Al Carpone cards, the game becomes very exciting; both teams will try their best to secure or prevent the shut-out. The tactical elements of this sequel are set bonus and shut-out. The Gravel cards are very tactical. Wise use of them can secure a win.  Its minor problem is the longest game in the Mystery Rummy series (around 5-6 hands per game).

The team play mode is quite interesting but not really novel.  It needs a few hands to find the way to communicate a hand to your partner.

The cards are functional and informative. It is not necessary to refer to the rules. I like all MR games, in which the cards provide some history information of each character.

Another great variant of rummy. Plays very well with teams. Raid cards are a bit powerful but if you don't put down melds to avoid being raided, you'll most likely go out holding possible points.

2-players only.  Need to review after playing with more than 2.

It's okay. But I can't give you any reason why you should chose this over normal Rummy with standar cards.

Alot of fun actually.  First in the series I have played.  Excellent card game, good to introduce to non-gamers.  Love how well the theme is applied.  The Gavel cards really make it interesting.

I enjoy all the Mystery Rummy games, using them for study breaks and such. This one has worked very nicely with four players, playing in teams of two. I just wish they'd all come back in print.

Thematically, my favorite of the Mystery Rummy series.  Simple, but simplicity is sometimes the best.

A very nice rummy variant. The theme is not great, but just right. The theme is not important in this game. Artwork illustrations are excellent. 
The gavel cards give the game new strategic options than traditional rummy. I discovered several quite different feasible strategies. A good game for two players. This edition also allows team play mode, which is a bonus. And the play style in teamed game would be very different. The scores between teams are usually very tight. A rather smart play is required to lead the game.
A game is usually finished with 4 or 5 hands.

O.K.  I finally get to play a Mystery Rummy game.  I had a hard time getting interested in the games.

I tried some traditional card games as a kid, but I didn't like any of them.  They always seemed like it was just about drawing the card you needed.  I am pretty sure I was wrong about some of them, but I still have a hard time getting past the prejudices I formed back then.  The name "Mystery Rummy" conjured a gut reaction that this is a traditional card game with delusions of being interesting.

A fairly steady supply of positive comments made it easier to overcome my prejudice, so I finally bought Al Capone.  Reading the rules turned things around.  The light came on and I had concrete evidence that that this was just a rummy game with a few special cards...

Still, my gaming prejudices have never helped me before.  Why should I give a rat's ass about some medieval Italian trading family?  Because its a good game!  Why should I bother with these stupid colored shapes?  Because its a good game!  Why should I give some stupid rummy game a chance?  Well, because I hope its a good game.

Now, that I have finally played it, what do I think?  I think it's a pretty good game, but I haven't really given it a full shot.  We played a four player game without partnerships just to learn the basics.  I have never played any partnership games before, and I didn't want that complication for our first game.  The important thing I learned is how important all those special cards are.  Sure, this is rummy at its core, and if that's all there was, I wouldn't be interested.  Those 5 key special cards take the game to a much more interesting place and just reading about them in the rules didn't give me any appreciation of that.  I am glad I finally played it.

I went ahead and gave it a preliminary rating with a little extra credit for my assumption that it is better with partners.  There are enough ratings for this game that an approximate rating won't have any impact.

Another fun game in the mystery Rummy series.  This one seems to have a little more luck than Jack the Ripper, but it is a really nice change of pace and a really fun game.   I haven't had  chance to play this 2vs2 but I think it would work really well.

I don't think this one is as fun as Jekyl and Hyde or Wyatt Earp, but still a pretty good rummy variant. Just doesn't have enough to distinquish itself from other rummy variants.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun addition to the mystery rummy series. Doesn't score as high as Jack the Ripper to me though. Whereas Jack had the twists of victim cards, and voting for the killer; Capone seemed to me to be more of a point-fest

First play - Two players. Another rummy game from Mike Fitzgerald. I already enjoy his Wyatt Earp and Jack the Ripper and this has enough change in game play and theme to make it worth playing. I did well because I was able to RAID all my opponents Al Capone cards to give me a full set. Unfortunately I didn't get the shut out as he went out first but I scored very well. We learned not to lay out ALL you Al Capone cards in that situation. I look forward to playing it again.

This is a nice alternative to the regular Mystery Rummy series, since it gives players the alternative to keeping cards in hand, or playing them to the table.  The different gavel cards will help players steal cards from either place, so it's important to know when to lay cards down and when to keep them in hand.  The game also supports partnerships, which can add to the longevity of the game.  In fact, the game is probably best when played with teams.

8 plays: 2 players
1 play: 4 players

After about a dozen games, this is challenging Jack the Ripper as best Mystery Rummy game. Not as complex as JtR but ability to draw two cards per turn, double uses for gavel cards and ability to grab cards from almost everywhere means interesting decisions on most turns.

A simple rummy game with a theme. This time it's Al Capone and it's been a hit with us. We will probably play this at the kitchen table for a long time.

The 4 player partnership game doesn't give you as much opportunity to interact with your partner as #2 does, but the clean design makes this a good choice for introducing new players to the MR series.

I don't think there's anything wrong with the gavel cards in Al Capone at all!  They combo very nicely with one another, allowing you to engineer full sets when used properly.  Excellent 2 player game.

Mystery Rummy once again enters my life after being gone for so long.  I am enjoying this series again! This version isn't quite as fun for me as the others, but I do enjoy it.

RATING: 5
After 1 Play: I was disappointed in that there isn't much to this beyond the basic Rummy structure.  Jack the Ripper has more interesting mechanics, but I'll probably play this more because my wife doesn't like the JtR theme.

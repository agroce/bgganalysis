This game is a lot of fun, but explaining the "insanity" mechanic to new players is always more difficult than I expect it to be.

The game is simple, but its small complexities are weird to teach to new players.

It's my own favorite version of Love Letter, but my friends don't seem to like it as much as the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
The production values on this are fantastic, and because a lot of my friends like the theme, it's now the most likely version of Love Letter to be broken out here, even if I still have a soft spot for the Batman, Adventure Time and Archer versions.

RATING: 6
A twist on the normal Love Letter with some cards having extra powers. There's a good bit of luck involved compared to the original which I do not consider a good idea. It takes away the deduction fun.

We decided to play it with normal rules and just enjoy the amazing artwork and production values. You rarely see a game shipping with very pretty sleeves. :)

RATING: 7.5
This is like "gamer's" Love Letter. It's the same basic game with the Insanity mechanic layered over it and it works well. The new path to victory offers powerful abilities but also great risks. It complicates the base game but experienced gamers will get it pretty quick. The production value is also quite high with included custom sleeves and custom poker chips for keeping track of score. The card art is also fantastic. I'd pull out regular Love Letter with casual groups but this one is better for groups with experience. The main negative is the rulebook is pretty poorly written which is doesn't help in a game that has a surprising amount of rules and timing conflicts. Also playing to the end in a 5-6 player game can definitely take too long.

Umm... Love Letter AND Lovecraftian theme? Yes please!!! This game is essentially Love Letter but with a twist... there are insane cards with insane abilities that you can only use if you are, well, insane. The catch is... if you are insane you have to complete a sanity check each of your following turns (based on the amount of insane cards in your discard), if you fail your sanity check you lose.

Not to mention, the production quality of this game is superb. The tarot-size cards come with their own custom sleeves (w/ extras!), the tokens are custom poker chips, and the magnetic box it comes in has a nice felt-like lining.

This is a MUST if you enjoy Love Letter as well as Lovecraft!!!

Fantastic art by Vincent Dutrait as always. I will never get tired of his art, it is amazing.

As for the game itself, it's great. I would recommend only playing the game with people who have experience with basic love letter. It adds a nice layer to the game without adding too much rules. It feels like it gives you a little bit more choice.

Some new ideas, for example, the option of taking some risks to execute a better action next turn. Then again, does Love Letter really need another layer of complexity added on top? At the cost of more chaos and randomness? Better stay with the original instead.

I think this game probably really shines in a group of 5 to 6 people who really love (and know) love letter and Cthulhu as a theme.  However, at lower player counts vanilla Love Letter is honestly a better time, and if the players haven't played love letter before, this is going to seem like pure chaos.  Art is great, components are good, the box is nice but way too big, which is an expression of the games main problem, it's a bloated version of something that is great because it is elegant, simple, and streamlined.

Donc il manquait le Love Letter Cthulhuploitation. Bon, LL, à la base, c'est un jeu hyper simple. On a une carte, on pioche une carte, on joue une carte devant soi. Quand il n'y a plus de cartes à piocher, la partie s'arrête et la plus grande carte posée fait gagner son joueur. La différence, ici, c'est que certaines cartes rendent fou son utilisateur, qui va faire des jets de SAN à chaque tour. Les parties sont donc salement rapides. Un bon love letter. Après, si vous en avez déjà un, inutile d'en posséder douze, hein.

Love Letter has reached a point in which you can really chose just about any type of theme for it and it will (mostly, I'm looking at you, Batman) work.
Given that this version is build upon the improved version of the game and allows for higher player counts, it does make for an interesting experience.
Can't tell if it is an actual improvement, but it is certainly a nice option.
Plays ok with 3 players or more, probably best with 5+.

We went into Lovecraft Letter expecting a good filler with an interesting theme. What we got out of the game is so much more.

At first, it looks to be entirely dependent on luck. While there is a significant amount, hand management and cardplay, plus deducing (or remembering) the cards, are the real keys to winning. Well, that and apparently being psychic like my daughter. She always guesses my card with her darn investigators! Haha.

Lovecraft Letter is fast, fun, and easy to get to the table regardless of gamer skill levels.

A decent version of Love Letter for when you want to accomodate 5-6 players, since the Insanity mechanic helps speed things up.

The rules could've used a few extra details for people who are unfamiliar with how previous versions dealt with certain situations and there are just some things not covered.

Love Letter with the standard amount of cards plus a compliment of more powerful variants.

These stronger cards induce "insanity", and an insane player must topdeck cards during their draw phase equal to their number of previously played insanity cards. If they reveal yet another insanity card, they automatically lose.

I've yet to decide whether I actually like this new variation or not...

Better love letter. Slightly more random, but with a risk/reward system for the more powerful madness variants on the cards.

An excellent take on Love Letter. The original version is playable if you remove the Insanity cards from the game, but the Insanity mechanic just adds an extra touch of fun to the game. Easy to teach for newcomers to Love Letter, with fast-paced gameplay and fun interactions. The art is gorgeous, the flavor is on point, and it's great that the manual includes explanations for how each character or item relates to the mythos. The cards are large, allowing more room for the artwork, and the game comes with envelope-themed card sleeves to protect them better, including extras just in case. For bonus points, the Elder Sign used is Lovecraft's version, rather than the better-known star-shaped one.

After reading the back blurb, my first impression was that this was just a worse and needlessly more complex version of Love Letter. But as it turns out, I actually like this more than the original.

I don't have anything against original Love Letter, but it feels a little too lightweight for my taste. The madness mechanic from Lovecraft Letter was just what the old game needed to gives it a little more tactical dimension for me.

This is a perfect game for those times my brain is stuck in a torpor and can't handle other more demanding games.

An exceptionally nice production of Love Letter with some extra cards to differentiate this game from others in the series. Going insane, like in other Lovecraftian games, seems to be a double-edged sword, but it's interesting, at least.

Unfortunately, the game isn't all that great. There are a lot of ways to get eliminated, which I'm not a fan of. Almost too many, really. This is a much more cutthroat version of Love Letter with an almost anti-theme applied to it. I'll stick with vanilla Love Letter.

I loved the idea when I first heard in 2015 that this was going to happen. Seiji Kanai has done it again! Lovecraft Letter takes Love Letter and adds insanity cards, new winning conditions, and accommodations to play up to 6 players. Though the game plays fast, there is a new wonderful tension in playing this one. Best with more than 2 players.

The AEG English production is wonderful. I wish I could see the Japanese version first hand. 

The 2 player game is not as good as Love Letter, but it is still very fun.

5 plays - This was a fantastic iteration of the love letter series, with insanity and "insane card effects" integrating into the game very neatly and without complicating what is a very simple but fun game. Enjoyed a little more than the original love letter, partly because of theme, but also because of the theme integrating so well into the original game concept.

Best edition of Love Letter so far.

Madness adds a great new mechanic.  Do you risk going insane to use the more powerful effects or do you play it safe by remaining sane?  Nothing is as satisfying as putting an opponents brain into the Mi-Go brain case.  

Production is also top notch.  
Art is dynamic, chips have a hefty feel, box is thematically beautiful, and so on.
Not only do they give you really nice sleeves for the oversize cards, they also include extra sleeves.

Lovecraft Letter is looser than Love Letter, which dulls the appeal of the Love Letter pedigree. Take the basic Love-Letter loop and add two players; add some BS; add some unpredictability. You now have Lovecraft Letter.

A nice take on Love Letter that changes the formula just a little.

I don't like that you can get a hand of both 8's and it means that you are just eliminated from the round with no way to prevent it. This has happened several times in each game that I've played, so it's not an uncommon situation.

Other than that it's fun. The new insane mechanic adds some decisions and adds a push your luck element.

One of the appealing aspects of the original LL is how quick it plays.  This version adds in a lot of things which are interesting to a certain degree but make the game stick around pasts its welcome.  Maybe it was just our group, but it dragged on for a while.  One of the guys even commented when asked if they liked it:  "Well, I liked it about half an hour ago."  Yep.

I'm not getting why people like this so much (or just Love Letter). It feels much like Fluxx which I know is not as highly rated. This is due to the random nature of the game. If it wasn't for the fact that a game of Fluxx can potentially last hours (or more) I would easily say Fluxx was the better game.

Thoroughly enjoyed playing this would make a great filler game only played it with three players and I can imagine the more the merrier, would highly recommend to anyone who is untested in purchasing this game.

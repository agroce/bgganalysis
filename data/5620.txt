I only played the introductory scenario, but I like the mechanics.  It is solid, yet unconventional.  I find it hard to wrap my mind around and not ideal for PBEM play, as every time I got a VASSAL log, I had to go re-read the instructions.  There is just nothing intuitive about it.  It may be the most complex game I have ever seen, but it's rewarding for those who are willing to put in the time.

Vietcong, NVA units, Marines, Airborne troops, siege, fire base, planes, US commitment, etc...... A small game but a huge overall strategic game play with operational details.

Love the infiltration and the 'seek and hunt' for Vietcong units. Once detected.... To surround and bring in the firepower. With all this going on, the background is busy with NVA filtering through the lines with more Vietcong units poping up.

Th overall political sway with the commitment of US troops and combat resolution is true frustrating and exciting at the same time.

A truly fantastic game and design even under current standards.

To play the whole 10 year battle requires a few sittings. But it's an experience that is second to none.

Good morning Vietnam indeed.

Nick Karp's excellent treatment of the most complicated, misunderstood and ultimately most divisive war in America's history. The NVA/Viet Cong player must steel himself for a long,blood-soaked haul to victory, while the US/ARVN player will spend most of the game trying to bring the foe to battle, and wind up trying to catch steam in his fist. The best game produced by the Victory Games folks though it does have a steep learning curve. A keeper.

When you play the US and put your 2 units on Da Nang in 1965, you're like these young GI who discover an exotic country for the first time. You're on the coast, it's just like holiday. But it will soon turns to hell.

The components are gorgeous and the game is impressively good to represent this war of cat and mouse between the US and the Vietcong which CONSTANTLY undermines every effort to control the road and the cities. 

The US can only win if he has the support of the local population (the US population also has its importance translated in a ratio between moral and commitment of troops) but his air and arty support is divided as long as the zone isn't a free fire zone, in which case he will loose support of the population. The Vietcong can almost appear from nowhere and disappear before US units can engage them. To avoid loosing support from the population, the US player will have to pursue these units in the jungle. This is where the air mobile units (carried by helicopters) excell but there are not too many. Sometimes the US units will just chase ghosts because the Vietcong is a dummy or a political section. The units can undertake several possible operations, even the unfamous "search & destroy". 

There are political rules with specific SVN generals which are so corrupted that the South-Vietnam army can't be used efficently. Sometimes the US player must attempt a coup to throw off the Junta but this has important influence on the population. 

When the US commitment (units and air force in Vietnam) exceeds the US moral (which constantly decrease with losses, sending too many units at once, etc.), the US units must leave the country and can only support the South with equipment (mostly air points). Without the US mobility and firepower, it become a hard time to fight the Vietcong and the North-Vietnamese army which is better organized and even stronger.

This was not the usual military war because there was rarely any front and battles can occur even behind your own lines. In order to win, the US player needs to balance commitment, politics and taking care of the population but he rarely can do what he intends to.

Nick Karp made the best operational game on the subject and it still apply in my opinion, nearly 30 years after it was published. He also designed one of the better wargames on modern warfare.

Only downside: the campaign is very very long but is is quite immersive.

Really torn on the rating, as this game is a tremendous tool for learning about the Vietnam war, but as a game, it is prehaps too simulative to be truly fun.  The individual scenarios are quite playable, because they lack the complexity of the political system in the campaign game.  The flowcharts and rules move a fairly detailed game along suprisingly well in the scenarios.

I would reccomend this to anyone wanting to learn about the Vietnam war, and I will hang on to my copy because it is so good as a simulation and a learning tool.  Oddly, one of my favorite games I will probably never play again!

This one is going on my table sometime this winter (at least the introductory scenario anyway).  It just looks too cool to sit in the box.

12/1/05:  got the game out and took a glance at the rules today.  The basic rules (i.e. the non-campaign game rules) don't actually look too complex.  What makes this game a true monster is the length of time it would take to conduct operations over the course of the entire game.   There are lots of reactions, fleeing, pursuit, etc.

2/2/11: ok, finally got through the rules and played the opening scenario, Operation Starlite! Only took me 25 years to play this game. I liked it a lot. Can't wait to play some of the bigger scenarios.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Minor addenda here: this is a classic game but it is a monster, as many VG games were. Although I played the cmpaign game when I was a teenager, I don't think I could do it again - it's just too much time and too much overhead for what I can currently do, gaming-wise, and there are too many (read: some) big games ahead of it I the queue - East Front Series, OCS Sicily or Korea - and I'm not likely to get a chance to play them either.

Unlike VG's The Civil War, which has been supplanted by Mark Simonitch's much superior The US Civil War, Vietnam really hasn't been improved on and there remain few, if any, good strategic-level Vietnam games. Fire on the Lake is closer to fantasy than history, and is too tactical anyway. Hearts & Minds gave it a valiant shot but has some balance issues (even in the 2nd Edition) and isn't totally compelling gameplay-wise. In the US, we're going through a weird revisionist phase with respect to this conflict, with neocons and some other conservatives embracing a "stab in the back" narrative (whereby the US military had actually won in 68-70 but was betrayed by politicians and liberals who didn't support the war). This is absurd on its face, but Vietnam may have gone back to being too political get a decent game on.
---
This is, IMHO, Victory Games&#039; best effort,  barring the Ambush! series. Complexity is high but not out of control as it was in Gulf Strike or Central America; the situation is interesting and the simulation pretty good, with a fair amount of replayability; both sides are interesting to play; and there are lots of strategic choices. Love the SVN political rules, too. The US commitment rules are not perfect, with the US able to commit too many forces to rapidly and to pick and choose amongst divisional assets a little too freely; but it works OK, and worried gamers can easily put a quarterly cap on US commitment increases. To me, more compelling than the generally more highly-regarded The Civil War.

Love the campaign game!  And talk about cool escalation rules - the tug of war between American commitment and public support for the war is out of this world.  Wonderfully shows the difficulties of fighting against guerillas.  A great examination of war as an extension of national policy.

Contrary to popular belief the basic rules are fairly simple, playing well is difficult. I played a lot of scenarios from this one and have always a lot of fun. Tried the Campaign once but we stopped brifly after the very first turn  (the Campaign IS a nightmare, because you get more rules and the smooth interaction makes playing well a dounting task). BEWARE the Commie player will sit idle for a lot of time, and when he moves it will be running. This is not everyone's call. 
A great simulation and a good game as well.

Tough set of rules, but the innovative mechanics model the asymetric nature of the war very well along with the concept of operations, pursuit reserves, etc. Also has rules for pacification, US commitment, politicized SVN leadership, interdicting the Ho Chi Minh trail and manpower reserves.

One of the best simulations of the conflict, the combination of fruitless S&D missions with the uncertainty of the NVA/VC plans shows the quagmire the US armed forces entered. The careful management of resources (and when to expend them on offensives etc.) for the NVA/VC player shows you their quandary on how to force the US out so they can take down ARVN forces, too soon and you don't have enough to do the job, too late and there are still Active US brigades running around shooting you. The historical deployment route leads to the historical result, that is not common in many simulation games.

RATING: 7
Cool innovative game that feels a bit broken, it is too hard on the Yanks, IMHO. I play with several house rules making it easier for the US, like a lower 'free fire' pacification penalty when not fighting in cultivated or towns, no VC dispersal before combat, and alert penalties if the target is adjacent to any other VC. I also fudge a bit on the pacification mods, for units not in cultivated I play with a 1/3 mod and have the VC choose which side of a border, which works out very close to the original but rewards swarms less.

RATING: 7
Good: Vietnam - Operational - Hard

Plus:
-Great map
-Quiet a unique system, search  & destroy...
-An amazing effort to simulate a very complex war.
-Hard for the US player to win, but this challenge makes the game so great: can you bent history?!

Minus:
-Campaign takes forever but I read a recent report that it is well worth it. Important to read strategy notes for both players.
Like the Battle for Normandy, early mistakes will break you later on witout mens to correct; you can play on, but all is already lost.
-Search & destroy is the name of the game; this repeats itself for hours and hours. This can put one off eventually unless you know it can bring you victory. It can then become addictive!
-Due to the nature of the cnflct amd the victory cndotions, the scenario's are obsolete. Imo only the campaign is worth playing.
-Playing the campaign is a huge investment but worth it if you are willing to invest.

I am surprised we hardly see exceptional games in the style of The Korean War, The Civil War and Vietnam. In my opinion Victory is lonely at the top as far as breakthrough designs are concerned. Despite the above comment, this complex conflict is modelled exceptionally well. 
Played it 20 years ago, happy to own a copy after all those years.it has a nice spot on the shelves with VG The Civil War and The Korean War.

Una de las mejores simulaciones sobre esta guerra. El jugador USA lo pasa realmente mal, la gestiÃ³n de recursos serÃ¡ su principal problema, unido a una situaciÃ³n militar muy comprometida. El jugador del Vietcong se lo pasa en grande, apenas sin esfuerzo puede ponÃ©rselo muy difÃ­cil al USA que a pesar de su potencial bÃ©lico verÃ¡ como cada vez necesita aplicar mÃ¡s esfuerzo para controlar una situaciÃ³n que facilmente puede verse perdida. Muy recomendable jugarlo entre 4 jugadores, los roces entre el Vietcong y el ejÃ©rcito de Vietnam del Norte estarÃ¡n al mismo nivel que las dificultades de entenderse entre el USA y el ejÃ©rcito de Vietnam del Sur. Es necesario iniciarse con los escenarios antes de jugar la campaÃ±a

Credit where it is due, the components for this game are gorgeous. However, for me the gameplay is sorely lacking. Combat losses can be taken from a pool of replacements instead of from the board. A great mechanic for WWI, (and does allow Marines to entrench at Khe Sanh), (and from what I've read, the US did view this as a war of attrition), but this makes battles less impactful on the mapboard. Strategic in point of view, yet the battles are fiddly with tactical minutae. I will try to use the components to update SPI's Year of the Rat.

This is &#039;the&#039; definitive game on the subject. It is the most comprehensive treatment on the subject and the most magnificient in scope. But this could possibly be the game which you want to play so much but end up nothing due to the mind-boggling of a perhaps overly complicated system when you carry out &#039;that&#039; search and destroy operation. There are numerous phases and steps in a given turn. The production value is very high because of the multi-color maps and elegant counters with different nationalities participating in the campaigns. Definitely a collector&#039;s item.

I played this beauty with a friend years ago, than recently I found a copy and bought it. In this days I tried It again, and I found that is after so many years still a superb game with innovative game mechanics. It catches the basilar aspects of the war and deal with them both at the operational and strategic levels. The campaign game is a true monster game, but there are several scenarios that exclude the political stuff: and the operational phase is surprising simple to learn (but is realy difficult to master!). Great game that deserve a new edition: a pity that many game companies give to the market so much expensive trash and let this game aside.

Great Game that put you straight in the boot of Generals Westmorleand and Abrams.  You can build up American and allied forces and play both the big battalions wars and the heart and mind (this one in a partially abstract way). On the other side you can slowly transform a small and eterogeneous patch of guerrila and ocnventional infantry forces in an impressive and powerful array capable to challenge and usually being destroyed (but this isn't the point of your strategy, even if your regiments still look impressive) by the finest military machine of the era. While this is definitedly a grand operational game (the 2 maps encompass all RVN and part of laos, cambodia and DRV) the game feels almost tactical with the conduct of the different operations around the country while at the same time you have even to follow the politics of the RVN government... 
Of course this has a price and the campaing game is really long, but not unplayable. Another issue is the lack of true political options. You are Westmorleand  and Giap, not Jhonson or Ho Chi Min. so big strategy is fixed ( you cannot invade the north, you cannot decide when to mine haiphong harbor...). But still a great game and one of my favorite ones.

I really like this game and Vassal makes it even better.  One of the most common complaints is the length of time the campaign game takes, but it is rarely mentioned how easy it is to play a half hour at a time with no loss of playabilty.  To me, the game is like chess.  Every operation is a complex (only in the coolest sense) amalgamation of a lot of choices all brought together.  Then all of these operations add up to success or failure in the political arena which then all rolls into just one jab, punch or knockout blow in the "big picture"!  Some people play chess to relax, this is more my style.  Really keeps the brain happy!  One of my most favorite games of all time and I am so very happy that Vassal only makes it better.  I believe this will make it much more accessable to people also.

Once you've mastered play mechanics, this game gives you a large satisfaction. The useful flow charts lead you through the original operations phase. The difficulty for the U.S. player to catch the Viet often force him to plan in detail also the minor operations and bring him to fight in different ways, using patrols, airmobility and artillery interdiction.

Very clever system, probably gets asymmetrical combat as 'right' as any game has ever done. That said, it's very long, and the system pays the price for it's detail in a cumbersome play sequence.

Complex and detailed game. It's my second wargame, since 1988 (yes, so old!!).
I think more tan a game is a simulation, with extended detail, as population control every season, province per province, having in mind the VietCong presence in that province, if your artillery fired unrestrained in that province, etc. All that will be taken in account to calculate the population you controls here. Your units will deploy (US) from regiments to battalions and vice-versa, multiplying your units in the (big) map. Control the commitement of US, and the coups made by the South Vietnamese Army to control SVN Government. Don't let american units be killed, or your morale will go down to zero.
If you're the VietCong, your units will be hindered to the Americans and SVN until they can flip your unit and discover how powerful is... or not. You can transport units from North Vietnam across the Ho Chi Min trail to the southern regions next to Mekong Delta, for example.
So a detailed game, so long a campaign game...

Really interesting game, very rich. I'll have more to say about it in the future. Probably my second or third heaviest game so far, on par with any OCS title I'm familiar with. Probably a little heavier than Central America.

After a second play, this is definitely my heaviest game. It's not that rules are that much more complex than, say, an OCS title, it's that the tactics are so different. This is not conventional warfare!

RATING: 7
Maybe the most comprehensive treatment of the Vietnam War with battalion and regiment size unit counters. This attempts to cover all aspects of the conflict (ground, ari, politics, morale and commitment, strategic bombing, reinforcements, pacification, etc.) starting with "less" complex scenarios and building up to the Campaign Scenario which covers the entire war from 1965 to 1975.

RATING: 6.5
Ambitious, complex and LONG wargame with a clever political system. Combat system is awkward, particularly the fire support and airmobilization rules. A huge amount of effort went into this game's design, especially the beautiful map. More of a monument to strategic simulation than a playable game. Good luck finding opponents willing enough to devote the time on this one.

This is one of the best wargame I have ever played. Rules are not that hard to learn, but the game mechanics are very particular, so it takes a little time to master them. The game includes a lot of scenario, of all sizes, and these are the core of the game: the campaign game, while rewarding, is really too long to be interesting, expecially since this is a game that punishes errors very hard. However, it is a true masterpiece, and it's without any doubt the best rendition of the conflict ever made.

Best game ever made about Guerilla warfare. But if you want to play the game make no appointments for a couple of weeks, it can take up to a 1000 hours to complete the entire scenario(1965-1975). 
Shorter variants are supllied with the game. From specific US operations, to Vietnam after Tet(1968) and the last two years of the Vietnam war.
The game gives a very good insight on what the US were up against. Early in the game it becomes very clear that deeper US involvement in the war only triggers more support from China and the Soviet Union to NLF forces.
Though US operations after a season look effective, most of the times in the next season it becomes, clear that NLF forces only moved away from certain areas or were disbanded for a short time to amalgate again three months later.
The key to the game is population control, so the overall morale of South Vietnamese forces and politics are on the high. This is almost impossible to do, due to the large concentration of NLF forces.
The US could have never won the war in the conventional way they fought it. That is something this game thought me.
Great game for anyone who is interested in guerilla warfare.
Note: My game has a faulty map, the maps supplied with the game do not entirely correspond with each other. Buyers should be aware of this. Though this doesn't make the game unplayable!

Nice graphics. Search and destroy operations often give you the feeling of "a sledgehammer to crack a nut", as the Yanks need to pile on rangers, arty, air support and helos to pound even a small VC stack, or they get away.

EXCELLENT!!! From the start of the game it becomes clear that no matter what tactics or politics you use, the Americans can never win this war. The VC and the NVA are the enemy to beat. The VC are hard to get at cause they keep dissapearing whenever they feel like it. With proper tactis for the NVA, carefully pick the terrain (mountains, hills or jungle), the NLF can't loose.
Must warn everyone who wishes to play the game though, the complete scenario (1965-1975) takes at least 1000 hours to play.

RATING: 6.5
Very good game - I'd rate higher if it was easier / quicker on the set up and play.

Overall I think this is the best out there for covering the Vietnam war at this scale.  The components are good (the map is better than good actually) and definitely fir the 'ease of play' model.  The rules look intimidating, but are really not bad at all - the only tough part is the Advanced Rules portion necessary for campaign games (tough to just read, but they make perfect sense once you start playing them).

On the downside is the playing time if you intend to tackle the campaigns.  The record keeping is a bit of a pain and takes some investment in time and effort, but it's what makes the game shine (tracking US / NVN commitment & morale; SVN & VC supplies and draft levels, and the ever important pacification levels of the population).

RATING: 5
The map and design here are detailed and ambitious.  However gameplay is incredibly tedious and inconsequential.  In the end the game is too much, too long, and too boring...and all the military details become window dressing for the all-important political indices.  A meter game where you trade one index for another.  

In some ways that makes this a realistic game...unfortunately it isn't one that you want to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For me, a disappointing game. I guess the depiction of the conflict as an endless "run, pursue and hide" kind of battle is true to life, but is it fun to play?

I did not like the game rules very much, there were few scenarios of different sizes (some tiny, others huge, but little in between) and the map is far from appealing.

Can not imagine playing the entire conflict, it must be an excruciating experience...where both side start wishing that "anybody please just win" and get this over with.

Possibly quite true to life, I guess....

A well working exercise in futility and frustration for both players. Still excellent, maybe just because of that.

The scenarios are not very fun - the beauty can only be seen and appreciated in the campaign game. Glacially slow, but your earlier decisions will remain to haunt you forever during the game.

Stunning game-system, one such that the question is legitimate as to how this indeed was ever possible.
Just released, back in the mid-Eighties, it triggered general dumb-foundedness, for to the date no one had ever dreamt about an operational and campaign game powered by such a sophisticated tactical engine. Once learnt, it will make you feel unable to appreciate (let alone play) anything else. The campaign game is only comparable to the happy few, such as Empires in Arms or World in Flames, and possibly better. You can't live up to nothing in your life until you play this

Vietnam puts you in the shoes of the US military commander who is bound by the same political limitations prosecuting the war, balancing between military success and political backlash.

RATING: 9
This fine product can best be described as a simulation of the conflict, as opposed to a game.  As the U.S./FWA player,  you will constantly face frustration at the hands of the political and social aspects that the game system imposes upon you.  As Sgt. Barnes said in Platoon, you feel like you're fighting this war with one hand tied around your *alls. 

SVN population pacification is the crux of the campaign game system, and is crucial to morale and committment levels of the major participants.  Once the NLF forces gain a foothold in a province,  population loyalty will quickly shift to the Communist favour for each turn that a sizeable NLF presence exists. Even when NVA/VC forces are ousted, it will take a long time for the populace to revert back to SVN loyalty.  

As the U.S. player, virtually every action you take will result in a drop in morale (and popular support for the war) back home. You generally feel like there is no victory to be achieved. You achieve a pyrric if the NLF hasn't won by spring 1975.  In other words, you play not to lose. 

As such, I hesitate to call it a satisfying gaming experience. Armed with the knowledge that a total military victory is virtually impossible to achieve, it's difficult to justify another play of the VERY long campaign game.  I've played the full campaign game three times in the 20+ years I've owned the game.  Being into my late 30's now,  my liesure time is more limited than in my teen years. I don't have much incentive to invest the 100+ hours to play out a war when I know how it will end.  This is why I still give World in Flames/DoD campaign game the odd playing... :)

Had this game as a kid in High School. I remember that I had it laid out on our table tennis table in my parents basement for many months. I played it solo for both sides. I have no idea what happened to this game since then. I'm fairly sure that I was able to understand the rules correctly and I remember enjoying playing it. I felt certain that I could reverse history if only I was in charge...a difficult thing to do when the game system cripples your options (much like the political and other factors of the actual conflict did). At best, I remember coming to a stand-off of sorts which is really the same as a defeat...again, much like the real conflict. My only knock against it was the length of play and the enormous learning curve. This game, like a 1000+ piece puzzle is something that you would have to place somewhere and leave for many weeks/months before it was completed. That's probably true of most wargames of this type, but it's not very practical otherwise.

Very un-orthodox game that forces you to "un-learn" some standard wargame tactics. The game also successfully juggles many factors like South Vietnam political instability, escalating levels of military commitment, the inevitable U.S. withdrawl, etc. I particularly like the handling of Viet Cong forces - you really do get to frustrate the US player repeatedly with constant "disappear into the jungle" tactics as you build up for massive surprise offensives.

Summary: Complete, playable, but in merely "acceptable" BGG condition.

Box fair -- extremely worn, straight vertical grooves on box lid, but still structurally sound.

Maps good/very good -- well-used, but no marks or tears.

Rules complete, including the inserts originally bound into the center of the rulebook (which have been carefully removed from the staples), but condition is fair at best (front cover/back cover page is also free of the staple because of spine tear, considerable wear, significant highlighting, two dark spots on back cover).

Counters complete (I verified them all), fully punched, bagged mostly by color. Individual counters in excellent condition.

Counter tray excellent.

Includes 2 mismatched white d6.

Especially referring to the campaign scenarios every choices that the US player take have a powerful impact on the whole game. on the other side the viet player can learn to use the flexibility given to his army to effectively frustrate any US attempt to reduce is threat.

The game perfectly recreate the spirit of that asymmetrical conflict.

Bought this as a board game newbie when it came out and couldn't get passed the rulebook - no idea of what 'interdiction' was, for example, and the word wasn't even in my dictionary. Not a bad game, just not a good game for me.

Well done game. It would be nice to actually play it with someone other than me.

Some of the scenarios seemed pretty good, but never could get the hang of the campaign game. Just don't see how the US can win it. Played it one time against an old Vietnam war vet. I was the NVA. Had to stop the game because he was getting really angry that he wasn't doing much better. I started worrying he might attack me!
Maybe it's just too historically accurate. 

That war sure messed up a lot of good men and women.

Still it's a great game for showing off. Great looking map and counters.

Got it (unpunched) from a thrift store, along with Raid on St. Nazarie. Some day I may have the patience to learn it.

One of the best and deepest gaming experiences I've ever had.  So very many important decisions to make every turn. Even better than MTG, which I have considered to be the closest thing to a perfect game I've experienced.  Each hero's spell board makes for a distinctive style of play, and the whole experience feels very much like a mage casting spells and summoning armies.

Let me first start off stating that I played the Monk, which I thought at the start of the game I thought was under powered. However, I ended winning. 

The graphic art is beautiful and the game components are neat. However, I think the game has some overly bulky rules and mechanisms. I think that it could be streamlined.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
Felt a bit like a mashup for Magic: The Gathering and Hearthstone.  I think the most interesting part of the game is you don't show up with a pre-built deck, you instead but your desk as you go.  The cool down stuff abilities are also very neat on the heroes.  I could see this one going up or down in rating with more plays, but at this point looking to try it more!

Some very similar mechanics to MTG.  Those that have played Magic will pick up the rules very quickly.  I love all the hero boards.  Each one brings a unique asymmetrical strategy to the game.  Fun pitting different heroes against each other to see how they mesh up.  Still have many combinations to try.  Figuring out how you want to spend your gold each round is awesomely stressful.  This is my favorite 2 player game right now.  "Sworn Enemy" format can be fun for a 3 player game, but 4 player can get a little clunky and long no matter which variant you play.  I'm glad I have the version that includes the Monk and the Ninja.

I'm backing it.  It's a no brainer.  I saw the review by Undead Viking and that was what convinced me.  Plus the art work is sweet.  I think you can even be a ninja type.  Even sweeter.  (update - I received my copy of it from KS and boy, oh boy.....it's really fun.).  Dripping with theme in my opinion. Very asymmetric powers.

Update: still a solid game with great artwork.  My rating stands.  I  played the Mad King character last night and it was extremely fun summing royal  guards to fight for me and soak up damage.

Plays/feels slow for a game of this genre. Want to try a couple more heroes before I decide to keep or get rid of this one.

Just plays too slow for me. Don't bother with the 2v2 mode. Doesn't work very well. It's just a game of focus down one opponent until they're eliminated.

This Game is fantastic! Its the one game my wife has wanted to keep playing since we got it. If you like games like MtG or Mage Wars, Allegiance fills that same void and may even do it better! The only reason its not a 10 is that I wish there was a mechanic or ability to spend gold once a turn to draw cards.

After several plays this continues to be fun and engaging, if you want a longer battler. Because of the large communal draw piles luck of the draw can be a factor, but if you don't mind that this is a very fun battler and all the heroes are very well fleshed out and fun to play. Beginners might think there are unbalanced matchups, but I would argue that the characters are reasonably balanced and luck of the draw or unskilled play is the main reason for runaway victories, of which I've only seen a couple.

7/14: Rated 8.5 based on the gameplay video and my extreme liking for the beautiful art. Honestly, this has some of the best, if not THE BEST ART I have seen in a game, Kickstarter or not. It is not only vivid, stunning, and skillfully done, but it also evokes the nature of the game through varying characters that actually embody their character outright in both design and gameplay. I cannot wait to get this in my hands and played many many times. This is definitely a game I will have to sleeve to keep it from being overused. I see many plays in my future.

3/23/16: Rated 10!
I am really enjoying the gameplay of this beautiful and well designed game. The components are top quality, with beautiful artwork and nice thick player boards. After getting in some plays, I am enjoying this game more and more and I am loving the art more and more the longer I stare at it. The characters are very balanced, extremely thematic and unique. I only wish there was the addition of miniatures, just because. :)

5/1/16: Dropped down to a 9 after more plays. Started to notice too much healing abilities occurring. Will have to make adjustments to this, to see what happens before I do another update.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: Joc tipus Magic on el mazo és comú i cada jugador té uns poders especials. No té mala pinta, però em fa por que al final tot es redueixi a baixar criatures el més grans millors i atacar a lo bestia. Voldria probarlo però al preu que costa (75$ + 40$ enviament) és massa arriscat. A més estic a l'espera del Codex, que en principi té millors crítiques i és un joc semblant.

No deck building necessary. Choosing which of the 3 decks to draw from is an interesting choice. Heroes provide asymmetry and cool reusable powers. Also see my comment "Magic: The Gathering" for an explanation on why I don't like that genre anymore.

After first play this game seems that it was given proper thought. Took us about 40'-1hour to finish.

RATING: 7
2016 UPDATE: Long wait but looks to be so worth it, now game in hand and production quality is GREAT! There are so many great things about this game, have not played yet but the standouts for me from what I know are: 

- Very thematic and unique characters that will require strategic and tactical adjustments accordingly for each

- A nice mix of Strategic/Tactical play, the cool-down Mechanic combined with other elements will reward good planning

- Easy to Learn, Intuitive to play, 30 - 60 mins

- Beautiful Art

- Should be fun!

Not sure if I missed something important there as I said I have not played yet but the more I see of the finished game elements the more I am so happy I did not miss the KS. I actually think this might hit 9 for me heck could go higher if it pushes all the right buttons like I think it will and balance is tight etc. 

UPDATE: Got a first play in, note take my very initial rating and comments here with a grain of salt for now as one important rule was played wrong (and totally my own fault not the rules). 

It plays mostly how I hoped and more or less knew it would after watching the play-through (it should be noted it was NOT a full play-through video which might matter here) HOWEVER, there are a couple of concerns here or one that is sort of two. I seen it noted somewhere that there might be "[i]too many ways to heal"[/i] and I totally see this too right now, and not only that though, but some of them are just wayyyyy too cheap too. I'm a little worried now that not enough outside blind play-testing was done (there were VERY few play-testers noted in rules as well) to flush this and other things out like costs on other cards etc which I also noted during play could be a little off here or there. The trouble with all the cheap healing is games could "potentially" be extended a fair bit. 

Again grain of salt here for now I really need another play minimum, I am still cautiously optimistic and worst case I will adjust some of the costs myself quite easily and/or nerf some healing (action cards in general were quite cheap and very very useful it seems) 

UPDATE: 7.5 => 7 Played again but was aborted about half way through, there might be two or three issues here, though one is preference. I'm going to try one more time with no tweaks but I am VERY convinced that most things in the action deck priced at 3 or less are WAY too cheap for what they do. Heal 3 damage for 1 Gold? Draw a card from each deck? Put two units directly into play? Many more examples. The funny thing is this helps a little to alleviate my 2nd issue, but yet it seems sooooo off. 

Number two which leads to three, is maybe more than the healing issue mentioned previously (which happened less this time but still present), it just seems the game takes a little too long to 'ramp up', and this also has the undesirable effect of games going longer than they should (preference) for this type of game, which to me should be done ~ 60 - 75 mins, 90 very tops, so far it seems 90 might be doable, might. The way the economy is outlined now if the game were to end faster none of the more interesting and powerful character abilities would be unlocked, now the game has this happen after like ~15 turns which just seems to be too many. I think an option to spend Gold to increase Gold production was one way to alleviate this, that or as my playing partner in this game suggested have the Gold production increase 2 instead of 1 each turn, that should ramp things up quicker. 

The shared decks while giving you an interesting choice of where to draw from (1 of 3) do have some drawbacks like a little higher in luck, no deckbuilding possible if wanted, and less uniqueness for the character (that one is more minor thanks to the 7 abilities and small amount of special cards each has). I played this game on the same night as [i]Ashes:RotP[/i], and on paper this should be the game I like more yet due to things mentioned it was not, Ashes is conceptually less interesting yet ended up more enjoyable

----

Watched the game play video, which after watching 10 minutes or so you know exactly how the game works. I also checked out all the available images of the Player boards/Characters, which is the main draw of the game here

Basically the game plays very similar to Magic, Warhammer Invasion or any other card tableau fighting style game BUT with one big difference, the Characters. The Characters and their powers are a little reminiscent of what you see in video games especially the cool down mechanic. Base game will include 10 unique characters, Druid, Ranger, Vampire etc and each one has it's own player specific abilities (7 of them) which are actually thematic and varied enough to make them interesting, and each has a few specific unique cards as well. On your turn you get some gold automatically (unlike random Mana drawing) and then its up to you where you want to spend it on these abilities, playing cards from hand, or save it over until next turn to have more to spend on better stuff etc, this makes for some nice decisions. 

Game will likely be an 8 for me, maybe even a little higher, it does look fun. (assuming things like balance etc are developed properly).

RATING: 9.5
Absolutely phenomenal game! First, the production quality is top notch, and the art is literally the best I've ever seen in a board or card game. This feels like it is designed for ex MTG players who no longer want to invest time and money into a CCG. If you are familiar with MTG, this game will be easy to learn. It creates balanced games by letting you choose which type of card to draw, and by regulating gold production (Mana) in a consistent way. Very streamlined, but the chaining (stack in MTG) allows for complex and clever cardplay. Only played once so far, so I can't speak to character balance, but it was most definitely a blast to play. I would love to see an expansion for this, or for the base game to "take off" and gain some popularity.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Game is really beautifully produced and the box is solidly built. I want more cards though! :-) 

The game comes with three shared decks (Actions, Basic Units, and Advanced Units) that everyone uses in order to build their hand/armies during the course of the game. Everything is purchased via gold - and that income grows by one each turn so the game can ramp up pretty quickly. There's quite a bit that will remind of Magic but there are significant differences (IE, you don't build your deck and use your own deck). Also, there are a number of different characters and each one is quite unique and comes with its own set of 8 actions/spells that can be used and then takes a number of turns to cool down and be ready to use again. That is the interesting part of the game in pitting two unique characters against each with different abilities while everyone uses a common deck of units and actions. 

The chaining of actions can be a bit confusing - mostly, one must just learn what moments one can play an action card. 

While four can play, this is likely best with two as a dueling game although I'd be curious about a partnership game of 2v2.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
While we have enjoyed our initial plays, the characters are made more similar than expected by the shared decks.We have also found that there doesn't seem to be that much room for skilled play to make a large difference. There are certainly tactical timing decisions, but many are obvious and not learned.

I always want to like this game more than I do.

Rating based on 2 players.

I liked aspects of this, the special abilities unique to each hero--and the cooldown periods after using one--were good, and the game presentation overall is very nice. However, I'm not a fan of sharing the same draw deck as it muddies the flavour of each character, each round felt kind of the same re: timing of attacks/defense, and the game lasts a bit too long. Certainly not a bad game, but I prefer strongly individualized decks (like in Ashes) when I'm playing a dueling card game.

Perhaps I'm a little jaded, but I largely ignore Kickstarter nowadays.  A friend backed and received Allegience and mentioned it to me.  I never heard of it, but it sounded intriguing. I was able to get one game in and I really enjoyed it.  The artwork is gorgeous and the components are high quality. If the word gets out there, and the various heroes are balanced, Allegience can be a popular and successful game.  I'm looking forward to more plays.

RATING: 6.5
Great artwork and good effort for a company's first kickstarter.  I was hoping it was going to be a more accessible Mage Wars, and in some aspects it is, but the complexity of the timing of plays in a turn is close to how messy Magic the Gathering's timing rules can be for new players.

I also can't shake the feeling that when both players are locked in close to equal exchanges, the luck of what you draw as elite units can make the difference over any remainder of good tactical/strategical plays.

RATING: 6
It's good, but not great, thanks to borrowing the mana system from Hearthstone and extending it to allow you to bank mana (gold). This works in that it allows for the game to present ultra-powerful actions, yet causes tedious upkeep, thanks to the player board design.

I can also see how it would be insufferable with three or four players. Two only.

Very interesting player boards -- they're all very different. Interesting attempt at building A Better Magic but it doesn't even come close.

I've been very impressed with this game so far. I wasn't a Kickstarter backer, but it looked intriguing, so i shoveled out the extra money to get everything from the publisher after it released. It was a risk, but I feel like it really paid out. This feels like a very streamlined version of MtG, with it blending together a elements of a cube with the EDH/commander format on steroids. Is it a Magic clone? Yes. Is it my favorite Magic clone to date? OH HELL YES. I'm praying that the publisher releases more Hero boards and maybe cards in the future as this could only get better with more content.

Developed by people here in town. Adds a character development side to a card drafting game, which drastically changes the way you play and engage in combat. Most interestingly, compared to other card drafters, is that you discard to a communal pool. It's more like "hand drafting".

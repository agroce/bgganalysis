[thing=127024][/thing] (1-6 players) is something with simple but interesting programming mechanism, not too long, and quite easy to learn and play with anyone using the co-operative mode. You are trying to find the exit room and escape before it is too late, but beware of the traps and lethal rooms. (Think of the movie Cube.) Contains co-op (or solo), team, competition, and suspicion modes, so is quite versatile. The difficulty level can also be adjusted. Comes with player miniatures, so no color vision is needed. This was the first game that prompted me to try my hand at painting miniatures.

If you've seen the movie "Cube," this is that movie in boardgame form.  This game doesn't have a traitor element if there are fewer than five players, and to me, the traitor element is what MAKES this game.  It's a great one theme wise.  At some point I need to paint the characters, since they're all gray and hard to tell apart.

Up to now, I only played Room 25 Solo. I think it is ok. I love the theme, for sure. What doesn't satisfy me so much is, that actually I only use 2 of the 4 actions available making the game repetitive.

Still, some of the games are more exciting than others and I can't wait to play the Traitor mode in order to give my final score (which I suppose will be higher).

+ The Audience.

Room25 is a social deduction game like Werewolf, but it offers a lot more as far as playtime is concerned. The mechanism of action programming gives some choices to make, but it's really nothing extraordinary... what makes this game cool is the exploration element, the thrill of flipping a tile you don't know, that maybe is going to kill you, the tension when you just can't find the room to win the game and all the interaction with the other players. I really like the fact that you can customize the complex, making it harder and harder as you get experienced.

Yet after 25+ plays I started missing a bigger variety of rooms to choose from. This made me even consider for a while to get rid of the game, because I played it just too much and it didn't seem to have anything new to offer. The game has also some production issues. The miniatures are nice, but it's confusing sometimes to recognize your character as they are all gray, and the tokens aren't very high quality and they started to show signs of use after very few plays. It's really a pity.

Fortunately Matagot released a great expansion, that fixed most of these problems! The components have been upgraded and a lot of fresh new elements have been added to the game.

Yet, again, after 40+ plays the game is not that interesting anymore. It's a good game and I would still play it every now and then, but I don't feel like owning it anymore.

Rating without the expansion: 6.5

This game had an interesting premise, but it was pretty meh. I want to play it one more time before I write it off, but based on what I saw I don't expect much. The actions are very limited, the game is pretty simple, and there's just not a lot of interesting decisions to make.

Cool theme inspired from the cult movie 'The Cube'. The problem is that the game doesnt work properly. The full cooperative version is way too easy to make it worth playing. The semi cooperative version is just OK without a lot of tension because the traitors (guards) cannot really hide their intentions.

RATING: 6
No hay que dejarse engañar por su aspecto/temática. No se trata de un juego de acción o aventuras. Más bien se trata de un acertijo o puzzle que hay que resolver antes de que pasen un número de turnos concreto.

Este juego exige buena memoria, un cierto pensamiento abstracto y bastantes dotes de estrategia/planificación. Nada se decide al azar y es poco probable que alguien que no se piense cada jugada gane la partida.

Como solitario es bastante aburrido y repetitivo. Como multijugador competitivo gana bastante. A medida que el número de jugadores aumenta las partidas se hacen más complicadas y el "puzzle" se vuelve más interesante.

16th Board Game I bought :D Attended Japan's The Gamer's Market Autumn 2014 when I bought this Game :P Saw how low the price was (50% off compared to Yellow Submarine) so I immediately bought one :P After playing it, I find the characters really lacking since they're all the same; could have added some unique skills to spice things up a little. But over all, it's still fun to play especially Suspicion Mode :) Nice Game :)

Cool deduction game, albeit somewhat light. Players (prisoners) are trying to escape the complex and 1 or 2 guards are trying to prevent them from doing so, through various means.

Rules to remind (in the suspicion mode):

1 - if the majority of players still alive are on the exit tile then all players that are not must reveal their identity.

2 - only after a 2nd player dies the first is revealed. If it's a prisoner reveal the 2nd dead player, if also a prisoner they lose the game collectivelly.

3 - if 1 player died the prisoners can only escape on the last turn of the game.

4 - 1 prisoner can be left behind and prisoners can escape without him but only in the last turn of the game.

5 - only guards can reveal themselves, if they do they don't have to preprogram their actions, and can choose their action when it's their turn.

6 - if the exit tile is found before the 5th (before the end) turn players advance the turn markers to the 5th space.

Aki látta a Kocka 1,2,3 filmeket, annak ismerős lesz a téma: szobák labirintusából kell kijutni. A szobák némelyike halálos csapda, és a szobák mozoghatnak egymáshoz képest... A játék, talán mert láttam a filmeket, nekem sokkal jobban tetszett, mint az egy évvel ezelőtt agyon ajnározott Panic Station. És nem csak a témája miatt, hanem mert ez sokkal letisztultabb, és bár itt is merült fel néhány kérdés, alapvetően egyben van az egész és nagyjából rendben van a szabály, nem úgy mint a Panicnál volt. Az is igaz, hogy nem egy kategória a két játék, mert ez csak fél órás, és összesen 4 faék egyszerűségű akcióból lehet választani. Némi bonyolítást a szobák sokfélesége jelent. Kész memóriajáték lenne megjegyezni, hogy melyik szoba hova vándorolt, ezzel nem is nagyon próbálkoztunk:) A kijárat megtalálása részben szerencsefüggő, részben az ügyes rendőrök is akadályozhatnak minket. Kellemes játék, de azért nem kell katarzisra számítani, hézagkitöltőnek jó!

Apart from its victory conditions, that are too restrictive and too heavily condition the fugitives’ chances of succeeding, Room 25 is a fun game, as players start with no idea about who the traitors could be, thus they need to trust or distrust each other by guts, which leads to a lot of chaos and awkward situations, caused mainly by both the second action all characters have to chose in advance and the rooms displacing or shifting often.

Fun game - co-op with a traitor mechanic. Once you have a group that has played a couple of times I think it will be quicker and more fun. Learning games often are never as fun as the 'real' game, and I think that may even be a bit more pronounced here. Definitely enjoyable however.

After more plays, this has come up to a 6.5. This game is easy to teach, fun for new players and non-gamers, and has never been a dud on the table. The ONLY way to play in my opinion is with the traitor mechanic; you may as well throw the co-op rules out as it is very boring. I have yet to play on teams, but I feel like that'd be ok. As long as there are some players working against other players...this game is great fun.

This is way more decent than I expected. Perhaps that's not the most compelling way to start a review, but really, I was surprised. This is a wholly enjoyable game. It's a difficult game for the spatially-challenged (like me) but not impossible.

First of all, I see absolutely no reason not to guarantee a traitor. I suspect this game would be way too straightforward and rather dull without a traitor - even if you were languishing in uncertainty. It is worth the small tradeoff of mystery for a better, more challenging gaming experience.

See, the puzzle itself isn't super interesting. But the puzzle becomes a lot more interesting when someone else is playing the puzzle in reverse. It's still a pretty light puzzle, but at least then the heroes have to commit to a plan that may not work out.

My long-term feelings on this are going to rely on the traitor metagame. After 1 play, I'm really not sure how much information you have to deduce who the traitor is or how possible it is for the traitor to bluff. If there's enough meat there, then I could foresee myself coming back to this. If the odds are just too stacked against the traitor, though (my group has played a bunch and has yet to see them win) then it's gonna be a big pass.

One game with 6 players (played with 2 "traitors"). It was ok but in the end I didn't feel really the wish to do another one.
As soon as the room was discovered the guards revealed themselves and then the advantage was really too big for them (especially the escape room was well placed for them, next to a deadly trap).
I need to try it in co-op mode, but not much to do except turn the tiles and find the right one randomly.

If you've ever watched "The Cube" you're going to want to play this game. It's basically a simple verson of the movie. 

Instructions for this game I would rate as a light-medidum. The instructions a pretty clear, but it can get dicey when trying to play anything after beginner. Its the tile set up that will sometimes make you ask why cant I set it up like this? Thankfully this game is pretty flexible in that area and you can set it up to how you like it without any problems. 

Next, the art in this game is really nice. Very rich color and interesting graphics that will entice you. However, I noticed that the little girl's appearance is different on the cover than on the cards, but this is no big deal in playing the game.

The game play once you gt the hang of it goes pretty smoothly, actions are set before you take your turns which gives this game a lot of strategy. However, tracking who's turn it is can be confusing because fo the ever changing first player. I suggest someone should be dedicated to tracking turns.  

Overall, my group and I really enjoyed this game and play it frequently. We give it 8/10.

Interesting light horror themed programming game that features cooperative, semi-cooperative, and competitive modes. Decent component quality, but just mostly functional.

Season 2 kicks it up a notch with some new rooms and special player powers. One of the better hidden role games I've played as it is more fun for me to bluff or deduce in this game than in a standard hidden role game where you try to get the most money or points.

Can't tell if I like it yet. The entire game I felt like I was just looking under tiles, announcing if it's good or bad, hope that my teammates trust me, and walk into it. Not a lot of variation. The whole hidden role aspect fell flat. The only believability of your character hinged on whether or not you told the truth with regards to what rooms you looked at. It's a mixed bag for me. As a big horror nerd, it's a good concept. But the execution was weak and messy.

Room 25 offers good variety of play and enjoyable team/traitor elements. There are several variants to play, so even one or two playthroughs may not be enough to understand the full experience.

A great addition to an evening's rotation, but I would not bring it to the table too often. It has the potential to become stale, despite the offered variety.

Cube as a game, I love it conceptually, as a game it depends on the group dynamic...best with mean people.

I love the dynamics of re-aligning the rooms, especially when winning and losing hangs in the balance, suddenly you are exactly where you don't want to be...and the clock is ticking.

Room 25 offers a couple of different game modes to provide variety. It's a nice gesture in theory but unfortunately fails when none of them work all that well.

Cooperative mode is far too easy and boring to be worth playing. When there is no reason to doubt the declarations of other players the game just becomes a silly sequence of "look" and "move" actions. No suspense at all.

When playing against each other things don't look quite as grim but there's still a couple of niggles. The "hidden" guards won't be hidden for longer than the first turn or two because there is no way for them to disguise their actions. Which means that the most interesting part of the Suspicion mode is over almost as soon as the game begins. Several of the modes include a restriction that you cannot leave (and thus win) until the very last turn if one of the players has died. I understand why that restriction is there but come on, there has got to be a better way to work around that problem. And in any case, success or failure depend far too heavily on turn order and players cannot influence that at all.

"Suspicion" and possibly "Team" are the only modes I'd be willing to play again, and there is plenty of problems with either.

+Escape Room

PROS:
-Múltiples modos de juego (solitario, competitivo, cooperativo, semicooperativo y por equipos)
-Gran rango de jugadores (2-6 ó 2-8 con Season 2)
-Temática muy inmersiva
-Rejugabilidad enorme: el tablero cambia en cada partida y, además, las habitaciones no tienen por qué ser las mismas
-Posibilidad de adaptar la dificultad quitando o poniendo determinadas habitaciones, habilidades de personajes (Season 2) o adrenalina (Season 2)
-La cuna de la caja es excelente
-Relación calidad/precio muy buena
-La experiencia no es determinante para ganar la partida
-El modo Scape Room le da una variante muy interesante con 9 partidas de dificultad creciente

CONTRAS:
-Es necesario enfundar las losetas de habitación, ya que si se marcan no se podrán usar más
-Los jugadores eliminados no podrán seguir jugando
-Setup y recogida tediosos
-Algunas habitaciones no tienen un uso que realmente merezca la pena
-El modo Scape Room es de un solo uso

RATING: 6
Hmmm... As long as you don't take this game seriously, it's an okay light game of walking into rooms and surviving their effects. Obviously it runs a lot on luck with how the rooms have been established at setup. I like puzzle games like this, but I guess I feel a little weak on it as it should have been a lot more. It works as a light game but it's a neat idea that could have been even better if built up to be a bit more of a bulkier experience. As a light game, it's passable, but not one of those quick fillers I would think of quickly when pulling one off the shelf.

Fun in Suspicion mode. Game would be rated a 6 in Coop version. 10 turn countdown to death. Everyone starts in the center of a 5 x 5 grid and you need to find the exit which starts in one of the 12 corner locations. Each turn you do 1 or 2 of 4 actions. Slide a row, move into a room, peek into a room and everyone's favorite push someone into a room. In suspicion mode it's like Resistance where 1/3 of the group will betray you and you have to figure out who.

Suspicion Mode is great--haven't played Solo, Coop, or Team. Of those, the only one I might consider would be Team, but honestly, this game shines best in Suspicion Mode. Plays quickly, is easy to teach, and people really get into it, trying to figure out who is a guard and who isn't. Lots of fun with a party-ish crowd.

Vastly underrated! This is the best hidden identity/traitor game I have played that can be pulled out and enjoyed by anyone--gamers and non-gamers alike. Much better with the Season 2 expansion.

Update: Still a fun game with gamers and non-gamers alike, still find it one of the better implementations of the hidden traitor mechanic, but with repeated plays I've had to lower the rating. There isn't much strategy involved, really, which is fine for a social group, and the game shines with the interaction and second-guessing, but it does get kind of samey after while. The expansion helps quite a bit--the Regeneration Room sort of addresses player elimination, the Robot Room is fun, the other rooms add variety, and more importantly, the players come with variable powers. (I wonder if the hacker character is overpowered, as he can swap rooms and control robots, giving him something he can do on any turn.) 

An easy one to pull out and explain quickly to a group of people looking to have some fun.

RATING: 6
Best with the Suspicion mode (with 1+ traitors in the group). But the guards/traitors need to time their moves carefully- once they make their move (pushing a player's character into harm's way), they're in the open. Gameplay is decent, but I can see tiring of this if played too often.

Good game that looks and feels like an adaptation of the movie "Cube" - even though the board is actually a square. Each player controls one or two characters who must escape from a complex of rooms, some with deadly traps, before the time runs out.

It is simple, light, fun and very thematic. It still requires some thought, although your plans will often be frustrated by other players. I really like that it has several playing modes, although they often depend on the number of players: cooperation, suspicion (cooperative with traitors), competition, team and solo.

However, it's not without flaws. The cooperation and solo modes are too easy, and the suspicion mode seems unbalanced against the prisoners. There is player elimination - which I would expect in a game with its theme, but it may happen even in the first round.

The plastic miniatures are nice, but they should be in different colors, as it may be hard to distinguish the characters at a glance.

I think that people that don't like this game is because they go with his player to far away of others and really on luck to win or loose, this is not how you have to play. If you are near others players the only luck in game is in which corner is the exit iniatially and you can make schemes to kill or delay the other team (in cooperative is not as much fun but is nice have the option)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2014)

Room 25 is a very simple game, but it is a fun one. The rules can be explained under 5 minutes and the playtime is relatively short (with fast players). The game is hugely thematic (I love the theme) and has great art and components.

I have only played the game mode in which there are two guards and the rest are prisoners, it was very reminiscent of The Resistance and I really liked it, hidden roles is my favorite game mechanic. This game mode features player elimination, it doesn’t bothers me but I know some friends dislike this.

I was disappointed that all the characters are the same, I was hoping for some special powers. Also it doesn’t make thematic sense when the nerd is able to push the colossus :D. 

Bottom line, I want to play it again soon, I also will play the other game modes to see if there is a better one for me but I doubt it. The CoOp game seems to be very easy without traitors.

Current Rating: 6.0

After more plays, I continue to enjoy Room 25. I thought the competitive mode (without any traitors) wasn’t any fun but I was wrong. The game can be fun when everyone is your enemy. I also thought that the game needed at least 4 players to be enjoyed, but we played with 3 players (each controlling two characters) and I really enjoyed that, this way you can strategize a bit more because you can team up the actions of your characters . After seeing this, I think I will also enjoy the CoOp mode as it seems the time is very short to find the exit, we will see.

On the bad side, in one of my games, I was killed twice (my two characters) before I even had my first turn. It was hilarious, but I know this can really affect some people, fortunately the game plays relatively quick.

Current Rating: 6.5

Update: After sending a couple of emails to the publishers, the broken minis were replaced. I've played this game once recently, and I really had fun with it. Will definitely be giving this more plays in the future. My rating might be changing.

There's a variant without a traitor? What's the point??! This is devilish fun when played with a traitor. A limited action pool contributes greatly to the enjoyment of the game, as does convincing the table that an innocent man is the traitor - to the point that he gets pushed into an instant death room. My one complaint is that I wish the game played faster, as if you are eliminated too early, it's a long trek with nothing to do while the rest of the group finishes the game.

Está bien. Es medio-colaborativo, pero al haber un posible infiltrado en la "colaboración" mejora al tener que descubrirlo y luego intentar escapar de él.

As a co-op, this game is too easy.  As a team game with 1-2 traitors in the midst in a 5-6 player game, there might be some fun and interesting interactions occurring.  The room effects are potentially entertaining and pushing someone can be fun...:-)  Still, overall this game lacks polish and/or challenge overall.  On the positive side, this one plays quickly and easily.  I do want to give this one a try with 5-6 players and additional unknown traitors.

Echt gutes Spiel. Nur leider bin ich zweimal verpflichtet worden und ich konnte mich nicht dagegen wehren. Dass ich meinen Mitwächter im zweiten Spiel ins Feuer gestubst habe tut mir leid, hat aber auch ein wenig Spaß gemacht :D.
Die Wächter müssen definitiv offensiver spielen und nicht zu lange warten mit dem aufdecken oder habe ich mich zu früh aufgedeckt? Wenn ich die Chance habe jemanden aus dem Raum zu kicken, dann muss ich das tun. Das sind 50% vom Sieg!
Aber ich kündige. Ich spiele das nächste mal als Kandidat mit (oder vielleicht doch nicht :)

This was a new discovery at Rathcon this year, and I'm really glad that I played it. It made my "I should try this soon" list last year during the Top 100 challenge.

I want to try more of the modes, but the hidden team one is absolutely fantastic, even when your own team mate pushes you into the death room. *glares at Benes*

I played this at the local game group, and it didn't excite me at all. It might be that the guy explaining the rules tried to assist us by explaining the strategy for each room, which resulted in the game feeling very scripted, as though there was only one way to deal with any situation. I'm not sure if this was the context in which I learned the game, or the shallowness of the game itself. I'm always skeptical of games that offer a bunch of different play modes, as though the designers hoped that increased variety would make up for the lack of fun.

The theme, though novel, isn't particularly exciting, with uninspiring pieces and artwork failing to really make the theme come alive.

The programmable aspect is fun. Pushing people into rooms is always fun. However, the hidden role is the best mode to play in, but it's way to easy to determine the traitor (most times). Still, it plays in about 45 minutes, so it's not a bad little game for what it is.

I've only played a couple of 4 player (2v2) games. I was very lucky and discovered the exit in my first turn of the first game. That game was very quick and quite boring. It is possible that it will happen but I also believe that's quite rare. The second one was a lot more interesting with fun player interaction.
I find it interesting that this game has different modes, and that it's relatively fast, 30 minute games.

RATING: 7
A very quick playing game that allows for a traitor or two to be added in larger games. I think the components are nice, but not outstanding. Limited options for actions, and not being able to do the same thing twice per turn makes for some tough decisions. While it can be played solo through six players, I would recommend playing it with 5 or 6 players and the traitor mechanic to truly get a good gaming experience.

Trasposizione del film The Cube in formato board game con un'ambientazione modificata, ci troviamo infatti all'interno di un sadico reality show. Il gioco offre diverse modalità, dalle partite a squadre al solitario, dal competitivo al cooperativo. La forma più riuscita a mio avviso è quella del 'sabotaggio', ovvero un cooperativo con possibilità di traditore/i (guardie). I giocatori interpretano prigionieri che, se riusciranno tutti ad arrivare nella Room 25 e ad uscire dal labirinto avranno vinto e torneranno ad essere cittadini liberi. Non amo particolarmente i cooperativi ma, probabilmente per la sua semplicità e per la durata contenuta, trovo Room 25 un piccolo gioiellino, snello, incalzante e senza tempi morti. L'unico difetto, a mio avviso, è che c'è la possibilità di essere eliminati durante la partita, il fastidio però è accettabile visto che stiamo parlando di un giochino da 30', diciamo un lungo filler.

[b]Room 25[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Well after four years of trying, a buddy of mine finally got me to play this by enticing my daughter with visions of being a *traitor. I'm not going to get into too many specifics, but the game has you trying to get out of a 5x5 grid of rooms using a programmed movement mechanic. The caveat is rooms start the game upside down and can only be revealed by walking in them [i](you can take an action to look at a tile first, but time is precious)[/i], on top of that we played with a traitor who was trying to kill us before we escaped. To add even more to the puzzle, tiles can be moved around via one of your actions, so things get crazy. 

There is plenty of player interaction, although you can't share too much information with your teammates, so you need to coordinate with other players without coming out and telling them what actions to program so there is no alpha player problem to be found. Rooms range from okay to pretty bad to instant death so walking into a room blind is usually a bad idea. Every player plays a character that has a special power and you can play the game as a pure co-op, traitor game or free for all so there is plenty in the box to hold your attention.

I think the game will be at it's best with higher player counts so it's not a game I'd seek out to buy, but I'll be happy to play it once in a while. It also got the seal of approval from my daughter and she is looking forward to another play.

[i]*What was really funny was that my daughter ended up being the traitor and relished the role, even though we eventually pulled out the win.[/i][/i]

Quick to learn, easy to set up, has very attractive thematic context and very nicely drawn tiles BUT its gameplay is way too simplistic. 

And, my biggest complaint, why on earth each character doesn't have his/her own unique abilities/skills/characters? That particularly bothers me a lot, cause that way there's no point to pick for example "The Dude" and reject "The Colossus" other than your personal likings on each character's sculpture or appearance.

It's a 7 for the co-op version, and a 6 for the semi-coop traitor version (given that my one playing eliminated me from the game second turn, immediately violating the social contract of fun for all - and I've heard it happen in other games so it's not rare either). The co-op was too easy - co-ordinating your actions for maximum coverage of the board and then the re-grouping allowed for an easy win. Co-ordinate and then program your 2 actions this turn, be it look at an adjacent tile, move, push someone else there (that's going to create some paranoia) or shift tiles along a row Labyrinth style to bring a tile in an adjacent row closer to you, or you to it. So the mechanics are dead simple - the game is in the discussion and the realisation. Or non-realisation however it turns out.

The game si basically the movie Cube (watch it if you have not seen it). A great premise where you have to exit a set of moving cubes by finding the way out but watch out for traps and possibly a traitor. There are a few ways to play so there is some veriety, but the game itself offers little options or strategy. But for a filler, since the game is maybe 30 minutes, it is pretty decent.

RATING: 6
My rating is based on the single 5-player co-op game we played...apparently co-op is NOT the way to play this, because it was easy, too quick (it literally took twice as long to set up as it did to play), and, frankly, boring.  
I can see how the competitive would be more fun, but then, maybe it would just kind of be a Wiz-War type thing?  Eh, I don't know.  I wasn't blown away, regardless.  Cool idea, but maybe it just doesn't translate to a board game.

RATING: 6
The game contains several modes of play (solo, coop, team vs team, coop/traitor) which was very appealing to me. So many diversity in one box! Good, have to try!

Turned out into a bit of dissapointment, as solo game is boring and unplayable, and standard coop is waaay too easy. However I liked both traitor and team vs team modes, which both play smoothly and bring a lot of fun for parties involved. Secondly, I had also an impression that originaly the game included more content which was split for marketing purposes into two parts (original game and add-on). 

Therefore final rank pictures my doubts towards the title, half of the content playable, yet entertaining. Should the box contain also add-on material, I'd rank it much higher, for now it's solid 6!

Cross between Werewolf and Labyrinth. Explore rooms (peek or move), move rooms themselves (rotate), or push someone who is with you. The prisoners need to discover then all get to specific room without dying. Guards try to prevent that. Without revealing who you too early are so you don't die.

Good game with some strategies and thrilling moments.
The cooperative game seems really too easy (good only for learning the basics), but the another competitive games are really great! I suggest very strict rules about communications among players. My favorite option is a "realistic" one: no one can say anything to other players if alone on the board, but they can say anything they like to other characters in the same room - even discuss their manouvres' order before the turn !

The hidden traitor mode has promise.  However:

Honestly, this one didn't look like it was worth the time to teach, so I never played it.

This game can be played in a number of ways including collaborative and competitive, with or without a traitor.  This, and the fact the board layout changes each time, provides a good level of replayability.

Truly, it's Cube the Board Game.
It's very well made, the rules are simple, gameplay is fast-paced.
The only flaw I was able to find (other than shoddy Polish translation) was that it is too easy. I would like a real challenge, while this game, even in the Expert Super-Duper Hardy-Har-Har Hard Mode can be easily won.
Still, gotta love the theme!

The head-to-head competitive game is a lot of fun, though somewhat shallow. The cooperative games are flawed, as there's too much perfect cooperative in the pure team-up game and too little opportunity for underhanded, unseen betrayal in the suspicion mode (though the suspicion mode is definitely better than the effortless cooperation mode).

Ooh, the movie "Cube" in a game box. Yes! You can play it this game in co-op form but if you want to see it shine play it against each other or in traitor mode. For the co-op the game is not complex enough but when you try kill each other and survive yourself "Room 25" will get rough. 
The changing game board (you move the cubes on occasion) with the hidden rooms are great, a bit excitement will likely wear off with knowing all the room options over time, yet I still think this is a keeper. 
It is a shorter game which I love (about 30 min when knowing the rules and no over-thinkers in the group). At first I thought it was sad the characters didn't have personal abilities but now I think this keeps the game more straight forward, the variety is offered by the different modes to play in (and really, skip co-op, the other types are so much better). I enjoy the dark theme and am quite enamored with this hidden gem at the moment.

I would never play anything but the traitor mode, which has a great feeling of paranoia early on, and a cool team vs team dynamic later. The great theme and interactions make this game work. The one major downside is player elimination. It can happen very early in the game, and since the game takes longer than the box says, that can leave people sitting around for a long time with nothing to do.

Get the Season 2 expansion (included in the Ultimate Edition). It's mandatory.

The co-operative game is too simple for gamers (even though we managed to lose track of what rooms we'd checked and nearly messed up!), and so the other modes are probably where this shines brightest.

The 'guard' variant is interesting, and the paranoia of having one or two guards was interesting with five players, but I suspect it actually might be all but impossible for the good guys to win if there are 2 guards. Especially if they're not sat next to each other... Perhaps a different player number is needed.

Still, I enjoyed it a lot and am keen to play more.

„ Pokój 25”, czyli Sci-Fi z dreszczykiem. 

Plusy: 
1. Klimat filmu „Cube”. 
2. Proste zasady. 
3. Tryby rozgrywki. 
4. Trzyma w napięciu. 
5. Kafelki i żetony wykonane solidnie. 
6. Bardzo dobrze zrobione figurki. 
7. Klimatyczne grafiki. 
8. Wysokie prawdopodobieństwo śmierci. 

Minusy: 
1. Wykonanie kart graczy (cienkie, delikatne, długo nie wytrzymają, polecam zalaminować). 
2. Brak różnic między poszczególnymi bohaterami (dodatek to naprawia). 

Gra „Cube” ojjj… Gra „Pokój 25” to obowiązkowa pozycja dla każdego kto lubi serie „Cube” i klimaty Sci-Fi z elementami grozy. Planszówka trzyma w napięciu od początku do końca szczególnie przy klimatycznej muzyce w tle. Nie jest łatwo przetrwać w tym budynku ale wydostanie się z niego daje ogromną satysfakcję. Polecam każdemu wykonanie dodatku „Publiczność” (wystarczy kartka i kostka K6) oraz zakup sezonu 2. Grę polecam i oceniam na 7/10 (Dodatek +2).

Juego divertido, ingenioso, fácil de jugar y de explicar, y que se asemeja mucho a la película "El Cubo". Tienes 4 Acciones disponibles pero solo puedes usar 2 en cada Turno: Mirar, Mover, Empujar y Controlar. Tienes que Mirar y Moverte a través de habitaciones a menudo peligrosas para encontrar la salida en la Habitación 25. Pero además, las habitaciones "se mueven" (con la acción Controlar), lo que te hace perder la noción del espacio. Hay varios modos de juego: el que más me ha gustado hasta ahora es el de "Competición" (eso de Empujar a un adversario hacia una habitación aun no revelada...).

The big advantage of Room 25 is that it's a small box semi-cooperative that can be played in under 45 minutes.  The big disadvantage is that the experience is fairly bland.  The room artwork is repetitive and the unpainted pawns are difficult to distinguish.  Conceptually, this could have been produced much further and even baked into a movie tie-in (such as with Cube).  As it stands, it's a lower-budget, lighter effort that has its moments but will probably not sell in volumes.

The theme is 80% Cube and 20% The Running Man while the closest ancestor for the mechanics would be Robo Rally.  

I've tried the hidden traitor and team modes, both of which are fun and generate some laughs (though if it turns out nobody is a hidden traitor in that mode, the game can be a bit dull).  I'd like to try the competitive mode but I doubt I'll ever bother with solitaire or co-op modes.

Neat. I really like hidden role/traitor games, so this was an easy purchase for me. I like the theme and the production values are very nice. 

I'm not a huge fan of programming moves and I wish the characters were more defined with special moves and such. Seriously, why go through the trouble of giving them unique artwork and miniatures if they're all going to be exactly the same? At least give them each a one-time-only ability. 

But this game has great potential, particularly because of the numerous scenarios (though Suspicion Mode with 6 players is the way this game is meant to be played). I may adjust my score upwards with a couple more plays.

I can understand the appeal that the theme has, but in terms of gameplay, I am hard pressed to recommend this game to anyone. It's really a "turn the tile and see what happens" kind of game with some very mathy chamber switching and a traitor mechanic thrown in for good measure. For me, the game felt very abstract, and I certainly did not appreciate the "tug o war" between the running men and the guards that it boiled down to.

Dull little luckfest. The completely unnecessary move programming removes any semblance of control.

Atmosphere and theme is a definate upside. No idea where rating will settle yet, only played suspicion mode. Overall I enjoy it a lot. But seems like in suspicion mode when the guards expose themselves the prisoners can easily start APing.

Interesting light game but It may turn into a mess if you play with the random guy, the competitive girl, the planner woman and the agressive player. It's a coop game , sure, but it's more fun when it's not.. ]:-D

Mi ha lasciato un pò perplesso, magari una sola partita è poco per giudicare, ma il gioco al di là di una ambientazione carina e volendo anche riuscita, non ha un granchè. Attendo comunque un'altra partita per ulteriori conferme.

RATING: 7
Played solo and suspicion mode with 4 players.  Still think 6 players is the way to go since that guarantees 2 guards and 4 prisoners.

Not as long/involved as BSG and slightly more involved than The Resistance, but I'm thinking it's a decent in-between game if you don't want something as long as BSG or something more complex than The Resistance.

I wanted to like this more than I do. It's incredibly easy for the traitor to make winning almost impossible if they wait to reveal themselves until the late game. The hazardous tiles are not as interesting as one would hope.

Kind of dungeon crawling for dummies, trying to escape a prison in a reality show. Nice filler, easy rules and different possibilities to play this game. From suspicion mode to solo mode. Replayability ... check!

Considering only cooperative game mode (taking into account my only one session with this mode) it's only 3/10 (simply I don't want to play it again). Maybe another session would be better (in my case 2-3 turns, discovering final tile 'room 25', and a few additional to complete game - nothing really special) but even then it could be hardly 5/10 I suppose. 'Suspicion' game mode saves the game (maybe other modes are also good).
(2016.05.25 I've to decrease rating from 7 -> 6 (as it's not '"usually willing to play"). I've played 'Team' game mode. Playability similar to 'Suspicion' (but I prefer the hidden roles generally). Our team in first two rounds has taken significant advantage: 2/3 of enemy team has moved to Cold Chamber (beacause of my lie that the 4th not yet discussed tile that I've secretely looked is a danger, I've sefely moved to that tile) and the last one enemy was killed (by nice combo: moved by 'Control' action near the Mortal Chamber and pushed there by the teammate). THEN in next turn opponent team has discovered Room 25. hmm... We didn't manage to get near them in 5th rounds. It was just like some puzzles and little guessing. And only it. I like puzzles in boardgame only as a micro-mechanic, not a whole game. That's why it's 6/10 for me (but I still see some potential in 'Suspicion' mode (some of the another future sessions might be memorable in some way).

fun, not so fast but nicely themed game of cooperation and deceit. the best part is the recreation of the sensations i had watching the movie "the cube".
not bad, even if probably not very replayable

I'm a fan of hidden traitor games, but I've avoided playing Room 25 for a while now because it looked like Panic Station which caught a lot of flak. When I sat down to play it, I did have a good time, but there was nothing that grabbed me. It's a perfectly average game and one I'll play, but never suggest.

Played at Essen 2014 with the Expansion in prototype. Enjoyed hugely and would love to play again - great traitor mechanic in a game where you flip tiles to discover a universe with rooms which range from the benign to the deadly.

My first game bought from Kaissa, back in March 2015! And ... it was just meh. It was boring solo, it was playing poorly with 2 people as a coop and it was alright with 3 or more, but we barely find so many people to join us.

soon after I bought it my collection started getting bigger and bigger and no one wanted to try it again so I gave it away. Every time I pass a Kaissa store though I see plenty of copied of it on the shelves and I feel some kind of nostalgia :)

Players are trying to escape the cube, and one or two of them might be guards trying to kill them. Rooms are revealed upon entering, but can also be scouted, because some of them will kill you. 
Plays quickly, and is entertaining.

Room 25 was at first a very light game, but both thematic, and fun. It captures the feel of The Cube trilogy, and The Running Man. My rating for Room 25 includes Room 25: Season 2, so basically equivalent to the Room 25: Ultimate. The Season 2 expansion fixed all my concerns, and made this one of the best games out there.

In the first edition there were so many poorly defined play modes, but this has now been fixed, and the game sings in any mode!

One sad point about the game is the fact that the [b]The Audience Promo[/b] should have come packaged with the base game, as the game is much more fun with the Audience Die. It's definitely worth hunting down.

The game has a great box covers, they've used foil on it to great effect. The game's components are nice, and functional, although I always worry about marking tiles in games where they must be shuffled, and moved around, yet their identity kept hidden.

Here's my base game Tile setup.

Required:
1 Central
1 Room 25

Red (all):
2 Acid
2 Flooded
1 Illusion
2 Mortal
2 Trapped

Yellow (all):
2 Cold
2 Dark
2 Prison Cells
2 Vortex

Green (only the specified):
1 Control Room
1 Empty (discard 7 Empty tiles)
1 Moving
2 Twins
1 Vision

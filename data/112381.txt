A decent futuristic/mecha rendition of the Command & Colors system, with plenty of mech figures and available these days at a dirt cheap price. The only real issue is the lack of variety you're going to get in the box, and the fact that it's lamentably a dead-in-the-water title. Map is a bit bland, and some components are lacking, but does it function as a few hours of escape for mech fans? Sure. I just think the idea of using such a system in such a setting has a lot of merit so I hope Borg would revisit it in some capacity.

Great mech battle feeling, even without much in the way of terrain. Rules are suited for mech like maneuvers, and it plays quite nicely in a reasonable timeframe.

RATING: N/A
The game is pretty light for whats going on in it. A basic skirmish type game that uses cards plus dice. This is a game I pull out when I'm with my more creative type friends, the ones who enjoy taking a game and breaking it to make it better, or in the least different.

We took the game and made ourselves an 8 player skirmish, free for all and 4v4. The crystals that power the mechs were handed out to each player and they in turn drafted a mech for the cost of it's 'hp'. Players could gain new mechs by destroying other players mechs and collecting their power crystals  to spend on more units. Each player also had a main base which could defend itself against attacks. If a players base ever fell, that player was now unable to build new units no matter how many crystals they collected.

Trust me here, the game was far more interesting with these simple rule changes. This is a game I'd possibly consider buying two copies for more options.

I think this would appeal to fans of the Commands and Colors series, or people who like the theme of giant robots/mechs.  I would put it just a notch below Memoir 44.  It has great components and a good theme.  However, it is very luck-dependent.  There are some strategic decisions to be made, but the Activation Dice, Combat Dice, and Weapon Systems cards combine to create three layers of randomness. Still, it is lots of fun, and  painted minis look incredible.

RATING: 6
Really light, fun "war game". The fun in this game comes from how swingy it is and how you can just enjoy the story of the game because you can't get too worked up about the die rolls!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
So far, very interesting and fun. Rolling dice for unit activations tends to make for a more tactical game, since you don't know what you'll get to do exactly from one turn to the next. ...But chances are excellent if there's a particular unit you want to do something with every turn, you will.

This does not have the level of detail (yet) found in a typical C&C title, but it's a much different experience from one as well. The hard terrain and direct-fire LOS rules mean that board position and setting up for cross-fire opportunities are important. Keep a reserve of Weapons System cards handy, too!

RATING: 6
Just played a test game with an 11 year old and I must say even with the rulebook next to us the game seems to flow nicely and one doesn't have too many instances where the rulebook is required.
Which is a good thing , I will rate the game after a few more plays and update this section.

After a few plays it became tiresome quickly and it never re-appeared on our table.

Lighter than the other C&C games, but it sets up and plays quickly. Not a simulation, but a fun, engaging game that would have benefited from some expansions. The models have definite "toy factor" and would look great painted. I look forward to playing all of the scenarios in the box.

My one unexpected, unlooked for purchase from Origins 2012. The designer taught us the game and his enthusiasm for his latest creation was contagious. 

This is a tactical mini game that might be easiest described as Warhammer 40k expres. It's futuristic mech warrior battles. The randomness/luck in a given turn is very high (card draw x dice rolling to see what characters can be activated, plus another dice roll for resolving battles). That said, there are plenty of opportunities for strategy and tactics. If the dice are against you, however, there is nothing to be done. It's so pretty that the simulation is still exciting.

Also, 1 is the new 6 and 2 is the new 1 when rolling 6 siders which amuses me to no end.

This is my favorite Richard Borg game.  I love the departure of the game system, just enough to be different, but with that same Borg feel to it.  Quick to learn and play, but with enough variation through random combat cards to make sure that each scenario plays different each time.  Another winner by Richard!

It's very random - probably too random for my tastes, since there is nothing in the mechanics to soften the impact of a couple bad activation rolls.  I found the combat fiddly and felt it was too harsh that units using shields couldn't evade damage by rolling a 'one.'

Physically, there's a nice amount of stuff in the box but the mechs are rather lazy and unattractive pieces of design - they are very blocky and look far too much alike for my taste.

Great miniatures for designing and painting, but mechanics fall flat. Several mission opportunities, but too much RNG on several levels, including RNG on what pieces you can move, removes any fun to be had in tactical positioning and strategy a player can have.

5-8-12 - Rated 8

After 2 plays I am rating this one the same as Memoir 44 in regards to it's base game.  If you like Mechs, then this one has some real potential.  Could go up or down from here depending on my future plays, expansion releases, etc.

Pros:
Awesome units, lots of potential to add more.  Liked the weapons system and wildfire card interaction as they can really throw a wrench in the best of plans.  The luck factor is present, but I think it keeps the game interesting and fun.  The 4-player option could be a blast.  I liked the different LOS mechanics.  Liked that some scenarios allowed for customized unit placement and different objectives to win.   

Cons:
The terrain tiles have no effect other than immpassable terrain that blocks LOS.  With a ranged fire range of 5, the board seems a little small at times.

5-12-12 - Rated 8.25
Upping my rating slightly after 5-6 plays.  A light fun game.  My 11 year old daughter said she likes rolling the dice.  She will play this game.  Won't play Mem 44.

 A very different take on the C&C system (which comes from an early version of the system by M. Borg himself. I absolutely love how it takes the system around by using dice to determine your orders, and using a hand of cards to resolve fights (with a huge potential at bluffing). The LoS rules are simple, but somehow it works. And it has robots to boot! Yet, there are problems with the game: a definite lack of chrome. Though the core system is elegant and works, it just screams for more chrome, a scenario building system, asymmetric factions, different mechs within each category. Basically, a Battlelore 2ed treatment could turn it to a great game...

Excellent models and I really like the mechanics involving the different dice. Unfortunately the rules regarding line of sight seem to be a bit clunky. The card aspect of the game also makes the game feel a bit too random for my liking.

This is not a C&C game. This is a good introductory miniatures game with a mech theme. It plays quickly; we played three games in a row in two hours. 

It is very simple to create your own set ups. It is very easy to teach and yet offers enough strategy to make it enjoyable.

The game is somewhat of a land version of Battleship Galaxies.

This is a miniatures combat game with three levels of random built into it's system. Level 1 of random is you roll dice, and depending on what you get, you get to activate different miniatures on the board. Then level 2 is in combat you play a randomly drawn card and roll a die, then compare against your opponent doing the same thing, winner deals damage. So far I'm still enjoying the game a lot. Then, random 3, is if either player rolls a "1", then they deal a critical hit to the opponent which causes the rest of combat to be ignored, and the target draws an 'on fire' card and resolves the effects. Some of these effects are as bad as effectively making your unit useless until you fix it, and others are as good as healing your unit significantly. Very confusing. The minis are beautiful, the damage is tracked in a really neat way by tucking tokens into the base of the figure. There's a lot to like here, but I'd recommend not playing with the fire cards if you don't mind house rules.

Another very good game for Richard Borg. Similar to Memoir '44 and Battlelore, but simpler and faster than both of them. Furthermore it supports 4 players just out of the box, without the need of two copies of the game like his predecessors. Mostly of all, it is fun to play.

A SciFi iteration of C&C - no zones, movement and activation dice driven, cards for combat. Looks like FFG Battles of Westeros cut down in some way. production mainly good, rules a bit awkward in places - define grid zones for example - we are going for the 4 squares around the little diamonds. Line of sight rules a bit odd, and we played them 'wrong' using a ruler. Still good fun.

Early rating after a couple of plays.

On the plus side, the game is simply fun. We had a bang-up four player session that led to a lot of laughs, and left the outcome in doubt till the very end. The Mech figures are very well formed, although a sharper contrast in size and shape of the various types would be welcome, at least for newbies.

On the minus side, the components other than the figures are functional at best - the terrain features are laughably bad standups in a game with nice figures - and the component storage is as bad as I've ever seen. The line of sight rules will bother many - you can only see along hex rows, so you may be unable to fire at a unit in open terrain two squares away, while one 8 squares away on a diagonal is perfectly visible.

Altogether the game is an odd mix, with similarities to the commands and colors series, but in a sci-fi setting. The combat rules aren't difficult, but the rules make something of a muddle of describing the differences between direct fire, indirect fire and melee.

All carping aside, we did have fun. Then again, nobody has asked to play again either. The jury is out; I'll update my comments should we get a few more plays.

Really enjoyable war game. The miniatures that came with the game are absolutely awesome even if there are only four types. Scenarios are short, game play is reasonably straightforward and really well balanced. Alot of this game ends up being decided by luck (which combat cards you have and what units you roll on the activation dice) but this helps to keep it fresh and interesting rather than allowing a player to perfect a winning formula every time.

Got it to play with the kids. Contains some of the same "you must roll right" or "draw right" cards to use certain units that Memoir 44 has (a mechanic I REALLY dislike).

Abaddon is a fun game, and as a tactical miniatures game that can be played in only 45 minutes, it fills a unique spot in my collection. The first two missions are a bit boring, but after that there is ample opportunity for tactical play. It remains a light game, but I consider that a strength given its short playing time. The components are just OK, but once set up, the game nevertheless looks pretty.

Another light wargame by Richard Borg that has several familiar mechanics with a few twists.  This one is lighter than most, but it still has some fun gameplay.  The lack of almost any combat modifiers other than cards though does limit the tactical decisions.  I would have preferred a bit more chrome and a little less randomness.

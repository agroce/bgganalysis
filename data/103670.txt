A miniature game in the pure tradition, meaning playing on a table with obstacles and tape measurers!...
Uses miniatures from the Dust Tactics game...

+1 Very simple and elegant rules, for a miniature game... Usually Miniature games are very complex and with tons of specials and exceptions rules...
-1 Because you will have to spend a lot of $$$ if you want a decent, varied army, like most miniature games... Miniatures in Dust Tactic Core Set are a good start, but you'll rapidly find you need more, diverse units (Axis is at an advantage if you use only the Core Set)... And probably more Dices...
-1 Cards (Stats, weaponry, etc...) that comes with miniatures are only compatible with Dust Tactics. They're useless for Dust Warfare... Disappointing oversight...

The rules problems themselves aren't terrible.  Designer's indifference to actually fixing them, as opposed to suggesting that you house rule things, is a serious dereliction of duty IMHO.

It's like a more interactive Warhammer 40k............ ya know, aside from the completely different themes.

edit: I'm angry that FFG got rid of this game and now somebody else has it. I can't imagine a scenario where that ends up being good for the game.

This game got me back into gaming.  Pretty simple playing, Alt-WW II was fun...  I've moved onto other games, but I still think Dust is a good gateway into minis...

I'm really impressed with this game.  The rules are elegant making them easy to learn yet they provide the player with a lot opportunity have make meaningful choices and superior strategy to win.

The Battle Builder is a mini-game that allows each player to via for the type of battle that both favors their army's strength while weakening their opponent's. 

The initiative and turn order is very fair and well balanced.  It gives the player going first less opportunities act in what is called the Command Phase and the chance to perhaps get three actions during the the main phase, called the Unit Phase, while the responding player more Command actions available and knowing how the battlefield is setup.  

Each of the blocs (Allies and Axis in the Core book) is interesting and both have differing general play doctrines and styles even within each bloc (depending on the units taken to compose their army).

While the game is I go, you go, the reaction mechanic keeps the defending player engaged in the game.

Not the perfect game, but overall pretty much what I'm looking for in a large(ish) army scale game. Decent army building system, gameplay that moves along quickly but has quite a bit of tactical depth (with reactions and suppression fire for example) and a really excellent way of generating scenarios and special rules before each game!

The models go from good (most of the basic infantry) to spectacular (most of the walkers). 

Highly recommended!

I love Dust Tactics. The board game is simply brilliant in how it combines miniatures combat and board game strategy and at the same time makes it playable in the scope of thirty minutes. It's great.

So when Warfare was announced, I was stoked. It sounded perfect. I bought it the moment I saw it in a shop.

Unfortunately, Dust Warfare goes away from many of the things that makes Tactics a good system. Instead of using the same stats and systems, it changes it to the point where the original mechanics are sometimes overruled.

I can understand the need for more complexity, but I can see many ways that the original DT systems could have been kept intact and I'm disappointed that they're not.

Gives a whole different game to play with the same miniatures as Dust Tactics.  Plays almost as fast, but with a very different feel for the tactics and strategies.  Once you get past the poorly edited rulebook and sort out what all the rules actually are, this is a truly great game.

Great game, unlike any mini wargame I've played!  The unique reaction mechanism makes you have to think carefully about your moves, and does a great job or replicating important dynamics like suppression.

Overall a pretty good game. Easy rules, cool Weird War II forces, and doesn't take too long. In the end it just didn't hold up for personally, it seemed like I was playing the same fight over and over.

RATING: 6
Easy very easy and fun! The only two issues I found in the game: some confuse book organization and some typo problems but nothing that a FAQ on Fantasy Flight website won't fix.

Have some interesting mechanics like reactions, supression and command orders. Simple in rules but deep in tactics.

OWNED SINCE 2013

THIS IS FOR DUST WARFARE

    At first I was ready for another miniature game, but my kids wanted it so I looked into it. I researched it and compared it to several other games that also had a non-castle/ knights/ dragons/ middle-ages fantasy theme (because I already had War Hammer Fantasy for that =). I was also looking for something fast and easy to play, almost to the point of a gateway miniature because I wanted to play with small children. It came down to Warmachine or Dust. My kids and I liked the theme of Dust better, it had cool Mecha and futuristic soldiers as well as normal looking troops. I also liked the WW2 time period, forcing allowing a mix of futuristic technology and older technology- very steam punk. Plus, it is a simpler game. 
      Well, the game is great. Very fun and a different feel then my other miniature games (Warhammer fantasy) and other similar board games (Tide of Iron, Super Dungeun Explorer, MonPoc, and Heroscape). It is easy to set up and I never have to look up rules. I just printed out the fan-made unit cards and that is all I need. Games are quick and fulfilling. There is no down time for any players and decisions are all meaningful. Also, one player usually does not dominate. Things can stay very close until the last round.

Update; since the game is no longer sold by FFG, it has died. A shame, really. It needs some rules clarification to complete it. I am cool with what I have at home, but with out more races (the aliens) it is not as good as it was going to be.

This game somehow manages to use all the pieces of Dust Tactics while overlooking every strength of its inspiration.  Where Dust Tactics is elegant, Dust Warfare is clumsy.  The game adds a lot of process and procedure to drag things out, doubling or tripling the playing time, but when you play the game you realize these aren't adding anything to the experience.  Take the scenario system - it seems like an interesting idea that scenarios could take place in poor visibility, but any Allied player with a functioning brain will always invest one point into this category and so it will never take place.

Would much rather play Dust Tactics...

Super detailed and beautiful miniatures.  The Dust Tactics version really didn't work for anyone I tried playing it with so it was even harder to find someone willing to give Dust Warfare a go.  Ultimately FFG no longer supports the game so I am glad I got rid of it when I did.  Unless heavily discounted like it probably is now or will be soon it was just way too expensive for what it was.  Not sure I've ever seen more appealing looking models though if you like this sort of theme.

RATING: 6.5
Update:  The game company basically collapsed the game.  Go ith Gates of Antares.

Update:  This has become my game of choice.  It plays fantasically well.  The preassembled/preprimed miniatures are nice.  Fantasy flight is supporting the game.  All in all, I am really enjoying it.

I purchased Dust Tactics last year and was less than totally impressed by the game.  I did not really like the board or some of the mechanics, but I did like many of AT-43 like concepts.  Dust Warfare is a tremendous improvement over Tactics.  Where the Dust Tactics boards felt confining, Dust Warfare now feels wide opens.  The command and suppression rules work well, and the models are nice.  Some reviewers have called the models "gumby like", but I have not really considered it a problem.  Stiffening up the plastic would be nice though.  All in all, its a nice game system.

From my first read through-
What I was looking for when it came to a tabletop version of Dust Tactics. The game has some innovative rules for an army size game. The Battle Builder scenario maker was particularly nice. Look forward my first game this weekend and for more in general from this game.

Not too shabby.  I don't like the rules that closely tie your squads together.  For instance, just because most of the figs are in cover you can't target the dude out in the open when he is in fact, way out in the open.  I prefer games that use the individual figs as the focal point.  Nonetheless, not bad and the figures are well made and look good.

Looking forward to trynig out the rules, beacuse I like what Andy Chambers has done in the past, the models are amazing, the game reminds me of AT-43 (a favorite) and I am a miniatures tabletop gaming fan.

This is the first miniatures game I have played. The figures come pre-assembled which is a plus for me, as I am not into the assembly and painting. I have attempted to purchase and play 3 minis gave in my lifetime. This is the first rule book written well enough to allow me to actually get started playing. There are some very nice mechanics involved in the game such as suppression, reactions, and variable player powers. I would suggest buying the rule book and reading it before ordering any miniatures. There is a  platoon structure that must be followed, so you can't just buy minis at random. Read the rules, write up a couple army lists, then order minis. A 300 point list, is the most common army size played. The only negative aspect is the fact cool new units are constantly being released, which makes you want to spend more money. This game will probably stay in my collection until I die, is the best war game I have ever played.

UPDATE: I am dropping the rating down as several releases have unbalanced the armies with the Axis being the weakest army. FFG dropped the support, and the game is in limbo.

UPDATE: Selling the game after the game became unbalanced. Takes up to much room in my closet, the walkers are too fragile, and Dust Studios and Battle Front have pissed me off. I didn't participate in the Kick Starter for the newly released units, but a lot of people were STOLEN from and never delivered units.

Both the book itself and the system are great. The  quality is top-notch, with a good presentation of the rules and the world of Dust. I catch myself looking into it all the time. Layout is fine, I usually don't have problems with finding stuff I need so it's functional. In my personal opionion, Dust Warfare is a stronger system than Dust Tactics so I would recommend this system to anyone, both the people that play Tactics and people that would like to try a nice miniature system.

This was my first attempt at playing a miniatures game and it was...enlightening. Lots of measuring and referencing rules and stats. I'm not jumping on other miniatures games quite yet.

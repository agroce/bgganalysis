RATING: 7.5
Simple game to understand but not that simple to win. The goal is to buy cards with specific numbers of gems but the key mechanic is changing your gems into other gems using a variety of formulas. Your looking for the most efficient route from the gems you have in front of you to the gems you need on the cards and you need to do it before the other players can.

I feel like the fun part of this game would be to really embrace the puzzle and try to really see how optimal you can make your moves. As such, it probably would play best as a one or two player game (there are rules for solitaire play, but they don't include a scoring guide, which seems like an obvious and lazy oversight).

Played with more than that, and you need to timebox yourself or the game would bog down, and then you've got the problem that you're not getting to enjoy the puzzle, so you're stuck with what's left in the game...and that's not much. It's just a repetitive cycle of swapping things out.

If you had a first-person marker, I think that you could play with simultaneous movements (though, it would be better if there was a die per player for this). Phase 1, everyone gets to perform a swap or dice roll, all at once. Phase 2, anyone who wants to make a purchase can do so, with conflicts being settled by the first-person marker. Pass the marker after every round.

This would allow everyone to sit and think about their moves comfortably. But, it also means that you need to find a largeish group of people who all really want to sit there and play a really intense, puzzly game. For that, I'd probably suggest Apocalypse Chaos over this one, simply because it's more interactive and, as a cooperative game, you're not going to always have the same winner.

With two, and no particular time limitations, you would probably always know whether you can compete with someone for a card. If you can't, there's nothing you can do to block them, so you may as well focus on something else. That's about the extent of the interaction. With more than two, I don't know that you would be able to spend enough brain to keep track of what everyone is going for, so all you can feasibly do is work on whatever you're working on, and hoping it stays in place. It becomes a solitaire game.

A better variant than the simultaneous play might be some form of team game. If I come up with such a variant, I'll post it. For the moment, I'd recommend against the game for most purposes. And even with a variant, I'd suggest against playing the game with the base rules.

Game is complete.  101 gems are present, two which are replacements.  56 cards, 1 die (which someone wrote a light blue "Y" on the yellow dot and a light blue "W" on the white dot), and all 10, slightly warped barter cards are resting in a black plastic insert. Lid top is a bit warped and faded, and smells a bit musty.

RATING: N/A
Game is absolutely complete.  44 pages on the score pad, all 100 gems present and original, 56 cards in good shape, 1 die (a couple of the color dots look a bit worn), and 10 barter cards.  A couple of the barter cards have a minor crease on them.  Box is pretty solid (one corner is half split) and shows some shelf wear, especially on the corners, plus there is the remnants of a price tag in the blue diamond special edition notice on the front.  Contents rest in a purple plastic insert.

RATING: 4
More equation puzzle than game, but quite clever. Die roll start is obviously random but after that it's usually more benificial to trade up. Play can fall in you lap with new result cards drawn or equally leave you high and dry. Must be played fast as AP would kill the pulse of this one.

Subsequent plays reveals this to be an extremely tedious luck fest. Need a colour, roll the die, if it comes up score 8 point. If it doesn't, score zero. Absolute downtime when its not your turn as you hope someone doesn't adopt your plan before you execute it.

Not fun, really irritating. Rating reduced to 4, but that seems too high as well.

Another awesome thrift store find (.99 Goodwill). Funny story about this, I owned Clash of the Gladiators for a very long time and my copy came with an extra die that I had no idea where it belonged. I eventually traded my copy of Clash but kept the die just in case. Turns out the die was for Bazaar. And the copy of Bazaar I got from Goodwill was missing a die! I love how things just sort of work out in your favor sometimes. Anyway, Bazaar is great! You will do very well at it if you can plan multiple turns in advance are trade in your jewels with 1 or none left in front of you. Will definitely be in next top 100 update.

RATING: 7
I don't know a single game like this one! It's a dead simple concept, either take a stone or swap some stones, with the aim of matching one of four 5-stone sets laid out on the board. 

The problem is that the swaps can be 1-4 random colours for 1-4 random colours and there's about ten swaps you can do, so it's really complicated in working out how you swap to get what you need - just when you are getting close, someone else acn complete the set you were going for so all your collecting is wasted.

A real brain burner!

Another simple Sid Sackson game that is very engaging.  It works from 2 - 6 players and probably even to 7... especially if it's treated as an activity rather than a game.  There's definitely a game there and players can play competitively and probably should pay some attention to what everyone else is collecting, but I find this plays best over a few beers and good conversation.

Although this game is very dry, puzzle-like, and subject to pure calculation, I always enjoy playing it.  A sort of minor brain burn that is pretty gratifying.  Can&#039;t exactly put my finger on it.  A game like Muscat is just too puzzle-like...Bazaar is just right!

Interesting trading game.  It's a good well thought out game, but the theme is not strong enough for me.  It's too abstract. Totally worth the few bucks I paid at a thrift store, but not something I would ever have bought full price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is fun, in an angst-inducing way: you're trying your best to cobble together the gems you need, while beating the other players to the card you want. That sinking feeling you get when someone takes a card ahead of you and now you know you have several rounds of brain-bending trading to do to pivot to a different target isn't the most welcome feeling in gaming :)

Nevertheless, it's a clever game and one I'm happy to pull out from time to time. My only main question is whether I need both this AND Splendor, but Splendor only scales to 4 players, and we've had fun with Bazaar with 5 players.

Fast and surprisingly challenging game. It seems to take me five or so minutes to get into the game enough to start planing several moves in advance. There isn't much to the game, though, and once you start to get the hang of it the gameplay gets kind of repetitive. Not bad.

Nice game of trading stuff for other stuff in order to satisfy "orders".  You have some chips, with some orders displayed which demand certain combinations of chips.  You also have a bunch of possible trades displayed which you can use to reach that goal

Basically a game of optimization and finding the quickest series of trades to get what you need.  It can be tricky to find the right sequence of trades without someone beating you to the order you're planning to fulfill!

Feels too much like an optimization puzzle with little interaction. The game works, though.

RATING: 10
Fantastic (and purest) game of resource conversion ever invented. Also one of the first. The joy comes from seeing the steps required to get you one of the product cards and enacting it using the transformation equations.

The trick is, of course, are the steps required worth it? Taking ten steps to get a card perfectly might not be worth as much as taking nine steps to get two different cards. Especially when getting a card perfectly, while worth more points, sets you back all the way to the beginning as far as resources go, while getting fewer points leaves you with resources remaining to start building towards your next card.

People absolutely must be thinking of their next move during other people's turns or the game will run very long.

An interesting puzzle-like game where, as is often the case with Sackson's classics, there is more than meets the eye - and the strategy to winning that immediately occurs to you turns out to not be the best way to win.

Still I'm not sure how many times I'll play the game.

We have the Discovery Toys version with the gems, but only play until two stacks run out.  The rules are short and very straight-forward, but you always have plenty of options of how to earn points.  In fact, there are so many possibilities that we wouldn't recommend playing this with someone who tends to overanalyze every turn.

A puzzle-like game of parallel equation relationships with a random input.  It works surprisingly well, feels very Alex Randolf-like despite being a Sid Sackson, and for me comes out in that strange class of games I don't like very much but am rather oddly willing to play.

Can be played deeply or lightly.  Some will enjoy playing it deeply, but for most that is probably too much work.  Many more will enjoy playing it lightly, as long as everybody in the group is playing it lightly.  One person taking several minutes (or more) per turn while everybody else takes 15-30 seconds per turn will ruin it.  (Traded away.)

Sackson's set collection game.  It's ok, but I think the design's a bit dated, as a number of games have followed up on the concept better.  The idea's ok, but it's go so little chrome so as to make even me think it's too dry.

It's a fine simplification of a market system, but it's incredibly easy to slip into analysis paralysis.  Then to make things worse, there is enough information on the table to make sure the cards you're going for aren't taken from you.  But that's more stopping the think about things and slowing the works down.  So to play it correctly, from the hip, it becomes a bit too light for my tastes.

Simple but clever game about converting 5 colors of coins into other sets and colors using a variable set of equations.  The goal is to fulfill order cards, much like many other set collection games, but this one is far ahead of its time in terms of production, presentation, and style.   It has one major problem, where somebody can steal a card you wanted right before you, and even worse than that, you can totally luck into having a newly-revealed card already completed (or nearly so).   However, it's a fast and simple game (with some good thinking happening), so it doesn't ruin the experience.    I enjoyed it.

Great game of logic -- trade gems to get a certain combination. We were originally put off by the "educational" billing on this game, thinking it was (a) dull like all educational games, and (b) slow and plodding. No such thing -- it plays quickly and is very fun. 

This is found in thrift stores quite a bit if you read those Geeklists and I always advise people to try this game out. For a dollar or so, it's a heck of a deal.

Though it is abstract and play does not match the theme very well, this is still one of my all time favorites.  You can think as hard as you want, or just play for fun and you have fun either way.  So simple in design yet so complex in the thought process.  I can't recomend this enough even though it is an old game, I guess that means it's a classic.

Played 5+ times. Gets a 6 because it is so old and unique, but actually playing it is a bit of a headache for me. This is definitely a game you would get more used to over time, and then do better at, but a bit of a brainburner. Uses a trade-with-the-game mechanic (not other players) and is one of a very few games in which trading "down" is often necessary to do well, since it is a set-collection game where extra jewels are penalized.

Not too keen on this one I'm afraid; I can't put my finger on exactly what it is that puts me off; it may be that this game seems to attract a lot of AP with relative ease, but that has never put me off before so I just don't know why I couldn't take to it.  Possibly it was down to all that messing about with different colours, and the lack of sensibility in the exchange rates; I just don't know.

Bazaar is a very efficient abstract trading game.  Trying to not only gain the right gems to trade, but to have as few remaining gems when trading is a brain challenge that feels just right.  There's quite a bit of a mental workout here, but one that is rarely frustrating.  Yes, AP can definitely get in the way of a fluid game, but a mid-game mechanic helps speed along the game so you don't feel totally stuck between choices.  It has some old fashioned luck swings with the roll of the die, but overall this game creates some delightful brain burner moments.  This is a classic Sid Sackson game!

Found in an Eastpointe, Michigan thrift store.  After a two-player game, where the green and blue gems were difficult for my color-blind wife, I didn't particularly find the game all that good.  The Discovery Toys Special that I own is maligned and perhaps rightly so.  Judy was able to put together a double-star purchase with no gems left over (150 points) and that sealed the deal.  Unless a player answers such a scoring coup, catching up to the leader is very hard.

Donated to a church fundraiser.

Found the earlier edition by Discovery Toys with the more Sackson-esque rules set.

This is the first out of print game that I turned to ebay to find; I have never regretted that purchase. I enjoy pulling out this game and teaching it to seasoned gamers who have never bumped into this delightful game. It takes a lot of careful thought to play and that's rare, IMHO, in a game that is seldom longer than 45 minutes to play. I have the 3M version and like it better than the other editions that have been released, but again that's just my opinion.

RATING: 6
Have to be fair on this one.  It is a decent game just not that fun.  There is a lot of challenge as you need to balance observing what matches your opponents are going for versus your best and quickest match.  People who say this isn't much of brain burner clearly aren't evaluating all possible paths/matches.  Nevertheless, I don't find this game all that fun as there is too much calculating work for such a simple game.  This one would fair much better on computer where you could more easily track all your available paths.  Perhaps it is the size of the 1987 version (10 trades) that make this one too cumbersome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Be sure to play with the original Sid Sackson rules and only about 40 cards (not 45 if you have them)!

A lot depends on the roll of the die and which trading cards happen to be turned up. Some are a lot better than others.

Love the glass pieces in our original set. We use some of them in micropul and as counters in Qwirkle on the scoreboard available in the files section here at BGG.

I own both the 1967 3M version, and Discovery Toys 1994 Deluxe edition.  Overall prefer the 3M version for play, but the DT DX version has nicer production value with glass "gems" rather than plastic "coins".  You can't really go wrong with either version.  

In total this game never really grabbed me enough to warrant frequent play.

UPDATE: The new Gryphon Games edition is a very nice production that returns to the original Sackson rules. I like it quite a bit.

Played only once, and I have since learned the rules included in my version are "broken." I'm eager to try it with the original Sackson rules.

It's a neat game where everyone races to trade/exchange their gems with the market in order to get the combination needed to purchase VP cards. The random market cards and VP cards will give this one a lot of replayability, plus the play time was nice and short.

Bier Börse version from Funagain one play - good version of Bazaar. 

The primary difference beyond theme is length. This version restocks the 2dn/3rd/4th stalls, so that the game lasts a little longer- which is great for last minute overtakers, less good for those maintaining a lead or looking for a quick-and-to-the-point game.

I think there's definitely something to be said for the original rules regarding the time allotted and the understated simplicity of the design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Plays easily, a little too easily for out first play, but I can see that some card combinations may be more difficult than others. It's the luck of the draw. Don't be put off by the fact that it's supposed to be educational: It works with very simple equations "1 green = 1 red & 1 white." But does not go deeper than that into calculus or algebra, so no high mathemathical abilites are needed. 

Tested it with the kids. They liked it, but couldn't figure strategy yet, so we played cooperatively. Kids were better after a second play.

Later: After a few more plays the kids really got into it. They really liked it (5 & 8 y.o.)!

Okay, didn't know this was a Sid Sackson design that was almost as old as I am! That aside, this is a simple set collection/race game. There are five kinds of colored gems, where you start with one. There is a schedule of ten exchange rates, where one can trade in a gem, or several gems of different colors, into a different combination of gems. Each turn you make an exchange, or roll a die to get a random gem. Then you may claim one of four cards that have a specific combination of five gems. The fewer gems you have left over when turning in your five, the more points you score. Rinse and repeat until somebody scores a preset number of VPs (i.e. 40 pts for a 3P game).

This is not my kind of game. The initial feeling is spacing out, like I was in a final exam, but I didn't know what the subject was! Only halfway through the game, was I able to discern the various gem exchanges that are available (and that change randomly with every new game), and making long term or short term plans in the swapping sequence of the gems. It is multi-player solitaire, with very little interaction, where players are competing/racing to complete a pattern on the cards before others. Although the mechanics are light, and the theme almost non-existent, this is a brain-burner of a game (sort of on the level of Mastermind), more so than I am willing to tolerate in a social gathering.

It's fun, like golf is fun, if you are a terrible player. Many minutes of frustration and disgust, with brief glimpses of smug satisfaction (like connecting with the golf ball once after 18 holes of shame). Am I willing to spend that kind of effort? No way.

Its a light contract filling game where you roll a die, collect a gem and then decide to roll again or trade with the market for other needed gems to buy cards for points. 

Was very surprised there was no trading with other players, I knew about this game for years and always believed that to be the case. Without that its a little dry really, but not terrible, but unfortunately the only interaction with others here is negative, meaning someone might snatch the card you wanted before you. Honestly seems to lend itself well to a trading with other people variant...

Thrift store find for $2. After an initial playing, I had to postpone this as I realized that I only had 5 of the proper exchange mats. It drove me psychologically nuts during play and I couldn't get past that fact...kind of like a repeating noise first barely heard in the background that seems to get louder and louder in your ears as you become aware of it; soon it's like a jackhammer just behind your headboard.

Thanks to a very generous geek, I'm now able to build the missing tiles and round out my game on my own coin.

It was a fun game though, mathy, no theme at all, simple to learn, and a bit trixy...much like Knizia games. Sackson was my first designer game guy growing up (minus Avalon Hill bookcase games) and I love Knizia games, so it's all good. :) Time to design my tiles to have a matched set finally.

It's a classic, no doubt. This is a prime example of how Sackson developed ideas in a pure form that are now embedded into larger games in interesting variations. Playing this game now, though, it feels like a mechanic without much game. This certainly IS a game, however, but it is more of a time-passing, solitaire type endeavor than something competitive. Something to do while baseball is on, food is cooking the stove and lively conversation is happening.

Wow how I hate playing this game! It is absolutely the most painful experience I have had in gaming (besides Munchkin). Why is it rated so highly do you ask? Well, it's because it is an unbelivably fantastic game. I am so impressed that it has held up so well throughout the years. It is just very hard for me to play because at any one time you know that there is a perfect series of moves which will allow you to score many points but figuring out how is so difficult. It gives me serious AP. I don't think I will ever solve this game and that's why it's staying in my collection forever! Also my girlfriend really likes it which makes me automatically keep it.

One of those Sid Sackson classics that can be explained on a single sheet of paper; a simplistic and family-friendly optimization game. Take and trade your way to victory point cards, scoring points for how efficiently you end up paying for them. Great for people who are adverse to confrontation - it's all about outthinking your opponents, and finding a way to buy your points before they do - or in such a fashion that it leaves you with less extra coins/gems/beads.

12/2006 It's basically a brain-teaser game.  How to trade sets of chips for different sets to reach a set matching one of the wares.  It's fun though, if you like logical puzzles like me. With two players it's fairly solitare - with more players the chances for a ware you're aiming for to be taken by someone else increases.

The original Splendor/Spice Road. What makes Bazaar different is that there are many more trade options (all available from the get go), there is an element of luck (as sometimes you might roll a die to obtain a good rather than perform a trade), and points earned for a card depends on your number of remaining goods after purchase (the fewer, the better).

The game feels much more tactical than Splendor or Spice Road. You have to be very flexible and each card you work on obtaining is like its own mini-puzzle. It is a different enough game that it is certainly worth owning all three. It is very impressive that this 50 year old game feels like it could have been released last week. Had it been, it would most certainly be in the top-500 along with the aforementioned games.

Nice little "mathematical" trading game where you trade with the game instead of with your fellow players. Has a bit of a dry/solitaire feel to it, but I quite enjoyed trying to optimize my gem-trading to get to a point faster than my opponents. Most of the time, players seems to eschew the die-roll, when in fact it is often one of the easiest way to get a specific gem colour and score lots of points.

This is a cool set-collection puzzle game that can be a little mind-boggling until you get the hang of it.  I like the design and especially appreciate it since it came out in '67 but it's pretty dry despite all the bright colours.  Recommended for a young players or the family.

Well, it's definitely old school. (Which means, I left a bloody trail in my wake.) Nowadays, this would be one element of a larger game, but it's Sackson, so that's the whole game. I appreciate the simplicity. The random setup aspect (at least in the edition I played) is also a nice feature. But, some of the available trades are I think too strong. In our game, one could trade a green for a white, a yellow, a red, [i]and[/i] a blue. Thus, having rolled green twice, I was able to buy a card on my third turn. If the possible trades were of more uniform goodness, luck would have less of an impact.

"The "mathiness" of the game is very typical of Sid Sackson designs -- very light theme, but very interesting gamification of otherwise mathy ideas. In this case, he's tasking players with solving algebraic equations -- but simplifying it into a step-by-step process."

Bazaar is a bizarre game from the inimitable Sid Sackson. What is it about? Well, my favorite explanation is that it's a game about minimizing error terms while iteratively solving a system of multinomial regression models.

That's not entirely accurate, but it's the gist of it. Another way to conceive of the game is as competitive theorem-proving given a pseudo-random set of axioms and a nigh-impenetrable set of transformation functions.

I really enjoy playing the online version, but was definitely disappointed when I played the cardboard version. I found the market cards to be more restrictive and that the game was very slow with 4 players (largely due to a lot of AP).

RATING: 9
Easy to learn but difficult to master - since every move counts and the cards can disappear any time there's a thin line to tread upon... the idea behind the game (trading properly) is plain brilliant for its simplicity, and the randomness of the cards excludes any strategy (you could say as well that it keeps the game thrilling), but at the same time the allowed trades can make achieving a certain card more than tortuous. Since not all cards (either ware or trading cards) are used in each round of play it's difficult to foresee what a game is going to come out of them. This all means Bazaar is a fantastic game to bring people to play, but might leave strategy gamers wishing for more depth.

Sid Sackson would use the "get them while they're there" idea again in Venture, and the trading in Monad - both of them are in my opinion fleshier, more accomplished games than this one, but neither as clean nor as easy to explain...

I got an original Discovery toys edition in the orange box for $5.00 off the local listings with what I think are the original rules.  We like the glass stones a lot, but the sorta yellowish ones are very hard to distinguish on a regular, brown, wooden dinner table.  

The game makes me think in a unique way.  What a puzzle and unique take on efficiency!  I enjoy it just for the different sort of mental stretch.  My natural tendency is to try and plan 4 moves ahead, so this came off as sort of slow and difficult at first. It's impossible to hold the 20 different permutations of trading in your head at once.  Reading reviews, I need to adopt a slightly more short-term attitude to enjoy the puzzle at a pace that is fun.  It's a keeper, but I don't think it will get a lot of plays.

RATING: 5
There's lots of think time required to sort through the all possible progression chains (there are 10 dual-way conversion equations that turn sets of gems into different sets of gems), to fulfil Silberzwerg type contracts for points. The game is stripped down to the core conversion sequence element, so play with a timer, and not as a late night closer :-). Not gripping, but an occasional diversion maybe.

RATING: 8
Neat trading game of a puzzly kind. Work out the trading combinations to collect particular sets. 

Slick feel to the game. Of course it is, 'cuz it's a Sid Sackson game.

Bonus that the 1987 edition has a solitaire rule.

RATING: 10
Pros:
Very unique and elegant design.
Brain burner - like mental math (algebra) without the numbers
Quick game, especially with team variants.
For those who don't like/want to think too hard, rolling the die is also a legitimate strategy.

Cons:
Not for the AP prone.

This game is awesome for kids. I played it when I was a kid and highly recommend it for a good family/fun game. The lower rating is due to the fact that I don't play it in the current board game groups I'm involved in. It is worth mentioning because it was so much fun when I was a child.

Kind of tough to rate this. At first, I wasnt really into it-but then I kind of got into it.  Sounds idiotic?  Yeah, but its true.  

This game feels like it might be an quasi-masterpiece, elegant in its simplicity, understated in its design.  

I'm just not sure how much I'll want to play it.

RATING: 6
This is a bizarre (no pun intended) game where a bunch of trade ratios are presented, and the players must trade their tokens such that they match a set of tokens on a goal card (with as little left over as possible).  This game can get pretty thinky as you try to work out the various trade permutations in your head.  It's better if you don't play with too many, as the goal cards will cycle through too fast for players to develop a multi-turn plan.  It's a very strange game, I'm not sure what to think of it.

The rules made this one look like it would be a quick, clever little game, in practice it was more of a slog as the equations often don't line up without having to do 4-5 steps to gain what you need by which point the card you were going for is most likely claimed and you're left with a bunch of useless gems sitting in front of you.

(1 play)  This was a fun trading game that has the feel of doing lots of little math equations, except your using colors instead of numbers.  The market and purchasing part of the game is efficiently designed and fun to explore.

It's a deceptively simple game that can be fast paced, but I'll bet some players could really drag it out.  Lots of room for analysis paralysis.

I like the scoring because it forces efficient trades because the penalty to burn your turns trading excess coins away could cost you the game.  I would have preferred a simpler method of determining points though.  A reference table (even though it is small) is cumbersome, and makes weighing options needlessly more difficult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I have only played this using a solo variant, and while I appreciate the thinking process involved, I find it a little dry and mathematical. Perhaps it would be more enjoyable and less puzzle-like with more players. It's just not that fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A clever game with a bit of luck, but mostly long-term planning with some tactical adjustments.  It's a bit tricky, as long term plans of different options may change when someone purchases a card you had targeted - and it takes a couple turns (usually) to recover.  But also, a card may pop up that someone can suddenly purchase (similar to Alhambra).  In short, the elements of "building" a pot of money is strategic and brain-burning, but can be quickly thwarted by a bit of chaos and/or luck for the other players.  Plus I always feel rushed into doing something when I'm still planning the chain reaction of gem-trades.

New to me last Christmas.  I quite like it.  It's a very puzzly sort of game; you will sit there and stare at the charts instead of talking with people.  I like it, but some people may be put off by the lack of social interaction in what is essentially a filler.

Bierborse (the German beer-house themed version of Bazaar) is an old Sackson game I picked up on eBay. It has some interesting ideas - I like the variable boards showing what can be traded for what, and the rewards for economical play. But it feels a bit like a fragment that could have been part of a more interesting game, and gets a bit repetitive. Traded away 10/10.

Very good and different old-school game. Takes some thought beyond almost all Euros. I always use my 1st chip to get several others and continue up to 6 or 7 and see what develops.

The 4 and 5-player games need to either add more cards to the stacks or only end the game when more stacks are depleted or else the game ends too quickly before every player has a reasonable number of scoring opportunities.

Rolling the die and trading in gems?  I'm there! The fast flow of the game makes Bazaar a fun game.  I have the Discovery edition, not the 3M edition.  Have only played with two - should be good with more.

Um jogo que tem tanto de simples quanto de complexo; parece estranho como tal é possível, mas logo que joguem Bazaar irão percebe-lo. Os ingredientes são muito básicos, as regras são poucas e o jogo é muito linear, não dando lugar a confusões; no entanto, jogá-lo é uma tarefa do mais exigente possível e esmiuçá-lo não está ao alcance de qualquer um, apenas dos melhores... É um grande jogo, especialmente se for bem jogado (o que pode torná-lo longo para o segmento a que pertence, pois este sofre e muito de "analysis paralysis"). Um dos melhores abstractos familiares que já joguei!

It's a little overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's so much fun planning several moves ahead. The mechanic that makes hoarding the worst thing you can do is one of my favorite parts because it teaches a new way of thinking that I love to show to new players.

RATING: 6.5
Cool little market game based on a variable trading system.  Not something that you want to play all the time, but the system works well and it is a fun brain burning puzzle.  There is a significantly high amount of luck as the cards are fulfilled the remainders can leave you with a whole lot of nothing, but Sackson (as usual) strikes a fine balance between luck and hard math.  Perhaps this will be a little dry for some folks, but I find this to be a solid timeless design.  I'm not sure I'd play this with more than four otherwise the downtime and any planning would get thrown out the window.

BSW play only.

Theoretically interesting -- need to create chains of trades to optimize your VP collection -- but I find it to be more work than fun.

--- Summary ---
There are 4 decks of cards showing 5 combinations of gems. The board shows randomly generated gem exchanges -- 1-4 gems (various combos) can be exchanged for 1-4 other gems. On your turn, either
- draw a random gem card and take the gem (if wild, choose one)
OR
- make an exchange according to the exchange table
Then, you may turn in the matching set of gems to claim a card; score VP according to the difficulty (cards with 4 or 5 of the same type are worth more) and the number of extra gems you have left over (more left over = fewer VP).

After a deck runs out, VP rewards increase for all cards.

Play continues till all cards in game have been claimed. The player with the most VP wins.

[Discovery Toys Standard 1987 edition] {Merchant, kid; dice-rolling, puzzle} It is a fine game for practicing problem solving skills. It's quite brain-teasing. Solo play is quite challenging, too!

I admire the design of Bazaar - it's elegant and simple. It evolves from a simple concept (it's not easy to design a good game but simple rules and concepts). The depth of decision tree is controlled by the dice rolls, which makes analyzing not taxing. The use of dice is clever; otherwise, there may be a solution for every card. This game is a good example showing how to use dice to introduce random factor to a game.

It's too mechanical for some players. I can't put it on the table frequently.

There are several changes between the normal and the deluxe edition. I think either edition works for me.

Engaging, challenging, stimulating. More a puzzle than a boardgame per se, which is fine by me because I love brain teasers. My wife is clearly better at it than I am, and I'm always up for a game. I can understand why it's not for everybody though.

I love this game!  A real brain burner.  Keeping track of the potential permutations for your opponents and yourself really burns through some processing cycles.  You gotta love the thin theme of Arabian Trading covering up what is essentially an abstract game of Algebra.  I have a couple of spare copies of this game including a spare copy of the Special Edition with the 'two star' cards.

Excellent abstract that feels really "mathy" without involving any numbers.  Trying to optimize the color equations in front of you can be as taxing on the brain as you want to make it, which allows this game to be playable by younger players, but engaging for adults as well.

A really good game, but is it replaced by [gameid=27385]?

Quite the nice logic game. If you can work out the concept well in you head, you can excel here. Better for the mathematical types out there.

I really like this puzzle-ish game.  How do you trade your pieces perfectly and get the prizes before everyone else?  Luck plays apart in this too.  If you gamble and get the perfect roll, then you don't even have to think too much.  But it is still very fun to play.
It's also very simple to teach and play.
7.5 = I like this game a lot.  I would play this any time.

This game is kind of dull in all honesty. We even tried with some advanced rules (Can only keep 8 gems, can only have 3 after buying and MUST trade every turn if you can) and it still was just very bland. Not horrible or broken just very very bland. As I've said in many other comments on many other games...could be spiced up NICELY with a deck of Action Cards.

One of my favorites of the early 3M bookshelf series, it's a game where you have to trade off colored disks with a given rule in order to create a goal specified series.  I really like the components of the 3M edition best, and find the game great fun.

Game companies should know what materials to use in contemporary game manufacturing. You can practically watch the boards and cards warp while you play. Too bad because its a great game and the bits of this edition would be outstanding if they didn't warp so extremely.

This gets old very quickly.  Even before the first play is over.  

It's a nice brain burn, but who wants to calculate?  Calculation is boring unless the type of calculation is interesting.  The mechanic here, turn some stuff into other stuff, has nothing inherently interesting about it.  Just hurts your head.

Perhaps a bit more computational than Sackson's other games (and thus making it a bit more of a solo affair), it's still whip-smart and a wonderful family-friendly brain burner that confirms the designers wizardry with making mathematically pleasing designs.

Sort of a brain melter. Really more of a multiplayer puzzle like Ubongo or Ricochet Robot. It's rough when you work out what you need to do several moves in advance, only to have the card you are going for stolen out from under you. Don't play with more than 4.

Use colour "math equations" to exchange gems for one another, such as "one blue = two green", then hand in the specific gems shown on cards to earn points. The trick is that the more precise you are, the higher your score. IE, if you hand in 4 red and 1 white and have nothing left over you get more points than if you have a spare green and yellow lying around.

I liked the game, but I got my butt kicked. This is a game where you really need to do forward planning, since you can only do one exchange per turn. I just don't have the ability to do that very well without spending forever thinking about it, so it's a bit frustrating when your wife does it routinely. :)

Roll the die and take that color chip or exchange a chip for different chips according the the exchange charts.
The charts are different each game. Cash in chips that match a 5 color pattern on one of 4 cards and score it.
The game goes on until 2 piles are depleted and after the first pile is depleted the scoring goes up.
It was okay. Not a lot of decisions so you were kind of at the whim of the die. It moved quickly enough though and I would try it again.

This was probably a great game "back in the day." I definitely can see the appeal in the early days of gaming.  However, now, there are too many other choices to have this qualify as anything other than an "ok" game.  Too much analysis without much "fun".

Each turn collect 1 random gem or trade gems at the Bazaar for other/more gems.  A number of goals are available each turn.  Players trade in gems to complete goals.  Having the exact need of the goals (no leftover gems) earns extra points.

Quite abstract, interesting and challenging to efficiently complete goals.  Not something I'd really want to play but it's not a bad game.

Bazzar a light optimization puzzle where you exchange your gems for other gems using a chart to try and collect specific sets for points.  The less gems you have left over (ie: the more efficient you are) the more points you score.  

Not any interaction beyond "Hey! You took the card I was working toward!"  but if you like this sort of resource conversion it can be a nice filler.  My kids certainly enjoy collecting the shiny gems... especially when they can exchange one gem for a bunch more! :laugh:

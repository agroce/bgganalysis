RATING: 5
I find word games rather boring, this one is no exception. Since I am playing this in a foreign language, there are often words or expressions that I don't know, so this makes the game less playable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game works well with parties. I'd say it is at the harder end of games for parties, as there is considerable concentration required, so I get this one out before everyone has had too much to drink. Very clever design, with bidding, presssure against the timer and the number of words you can use.
Recommended for parties of 6 or more people.

Winning Moves (1997)
Word guessing game where the competing team representatives bid to determine the lowest number of "clue" words that will be required to get his teammates to say five words from the game card within sixty seconds. Easy to learn and it accommodates 6-16 players very well.

I play only one guess per clue word, otherwise you're never bidding that high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
We eventually called this "9 words or less," but I guess we play games fairly seriously. OK, but there are quite a few party games I'd pull out before this one.

The new version has harder clues, so I raised my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great party game.  It's basically Taboo, however the teams bid on how few words they can use to get their teammates to guess everything on the card.  It makes for some tense clue giving as you often try to boil down the essence of the word in just one or two words.

RATING: 5
A pretty good party game that takes a few tries before you get a feel for how to maximize your use of words and time.  The bidding to play the card is what makes the game (as long as everyone makes reasonable bids).

Enjoyable party game.  Some people like to play this game very fast... but I prefer to give players 2 minutes or so to come up with their fewest number of words prior to the "bidding".

As much as I like Password, the auction format falls flat because it's fun to play the card, but winning the card is less likely when giving the clues. Maximum enjoyment when the game is played using a variant rule.

Good party game, but make sure to pair people together that have similar risk-aversion. Someone ballsy paired with someone timid will always be pitching words (and probably getting the point, since the timid person won't call their bluff).

Possibly my fave party game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game, with rules as written, just does not work for me. It's too much of a freeforall with people shouting out every possible guess for each clue word. You just think of every meaning and association for a word and just fire out rapid guesses and it pretty much works every time. So it is easy to get these in very few words. 7 or 8 max when I played. Plus, it fails as a party game because to work it has to be policed very strictly - people can't make any gestures, unfair intonations, or signal players who are on the right track. That is not fun to do, and it just fails if you don't do it. I could see this being house ruled into a good game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.67
Very fun party word game.  In our group, the pressure to get the bid lower tends to win out over good judgment; we may lose the card, but doggone it, we won the bid.  Our best successful bid is 6; I'm pretty sure I've gotten a 5 practicing with my wife.  Conceivably, you could get a 4 if you can use one clue and get more than word guessed out of it.  Advice to guessers: Guess early and often!

RATING: 8
This is a great party game; it took over Taboo on our best word-guessing game list.  The one problem it does have is that if you have a real cocky bidder on one team, s/he can prevent the person on the other team from ever giving clues.  Our group rarely had that problem unless we had a newbie in the crowd who felt like they had to prove themself (can you say LOSER?).

My friends tend to make the game too stressful by bidding the number of words down extremely low which makes play somewhat agonizing.

Not a horrible party game, but the central mechanism will probably break with fairly accomplished gamers, as it will often boil down if you can get five words with five/six words.

The bidding wars between my brother and his wife are hilarious; the winning bidder invariably loses the card. The day is coming when one of those two will take the bid at zero and then just stand mute, hoping his or her teammates are mind readers. Later editions of this game use more difficult words than the first one did.

RATING: N/A
Players divide up into two teams. The current clue-givers look at a list of five words that they're going to have to get their teammates to say using only words (aka, no sounds or gestures). The clue-givers bid on the number of words that they can accomplish the feat, with the lowest bid getting the honor of doing so. If the team cannot successfully name the words in the allotted time and with the bid number of words (or less), then the other team gets the point. The first team to collect ten points is the winner.

In spite of its low ratings, I consider this the best party game, so I've given it a correspondingly high rating.  When it went on sale at K•B Toys for $5, I bought about a dozen copies and gave them all away, to the delight of all the recipients.

Sort of like password, but different. Imagine a cross between Password and "Name that Tune." It has that problem like Charades does in that if your team is in sync with your oddball clues, you'll do really well and if they're not you will get very frustrated.

See my review for more details.

I'm not a big fan of party games but this one works sometime.  A lot of "dead" time for the team not playing, but in some occasions a little casual dead time is a good thing.  Some prefer this to the constant engagement needed in a game like Time's Up.  (I prefer the constant engagement.)

This is a fun game when playing, but there is a large "down time" issue.  I think a 30 second timer for the "talkers" to think about the word would not only speed things up but also reduce the certainty of the number of words needed.

Clearly not the game for me. The edition we played was supposedly newer and the words were rediculously hard. We aborted the game after the frustration with the cards. One in the group wanted to prove you could do one of the cards in the time alotted with the sand timer (1 minute). He did it, but he spent a lot of time thinking of the clues for each word. Waaaayyy to much effort to make it any kind of fun for me.

This is a pretty stripped down and bare party game.  I played with an older version and some of the words were just too hard to relate and often sunk the scoring.  It seemes like the winning team was often handed the victory by sitting quietly and letting the other team stumble and self destruct to get easy points.  I'm starting to wonder if there are any party games out there that don't suffer from significant scoring problems...then again they're party games.  Who cares?

One of the best of the word clue/ guessing games. Team based. One player from each team looks at the same card listing five words and then bets starting at 25 words whether they can get their team to say those five words using the fewest hint words or less before a timer runs out. Lots of tension and fun.

Very similar to taboo, but the bidding mechanism seems to balance out if there's an easy card or a hard card.  With taboo if you get a streak of good cards you can rack up a lot of points.  With this game you can make an "easy" card much more difficult.

Didn't do so well at this, although I got off to an easy start.

This game can really use some familiarity with your teammates.  When my college friends had reached pretty consistently high Taboo scores, we moved onto this game.  Eventually, we bid no more than five to seven on most of the five-term cards.

Playing time is less balanced than for Taboo, as some bidders may be more aggressive.  There's also less to do as a clue-giver, especially if you bid low like my old group.  I doubt we could manage many bids of five these days.

Its odd that it works only with 4

Only played once, with 4 players.  Looking forward to playing with more as our game had one clue-giver to one guesser, seriously limiting the chance that the words could be guessed in the time allotted.

RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Bid on the number of words you'll be able to use to get your team to guess five words. Pass-or-play!

Played as: 8,12 player.

Pros: Simple social party game with some direct interaction with the other team while bidding on who gets to play and then the moment of truth when you see if you can get your team to guess the words. It's fun to try and imagine your optimal words while bidding and compare it what your opponent uses on the times you pass.

Cons: The down time is considerable since it takes 30 seconds or so to play your words, and only holds real interest half the time when your team gets to play. Besides that, the regularity of how often you get to enjoy the bidding may only be a 2-3 times a game which is the real slow-down point as all but two players bide their time waiting for however long it takes the two active players to analyze and bid, re-analyze and so on.

Other: I guess party games in general are supposed to have down-time in order to socialize, but I've never considered myself a party-gamer so take my criticism with that in mind.  I think this would be a really interesting team game with just 4 people. That should minimize downtime considerably and make the game much more intimate and personal as the funnest part (the bidding) is more frequent, and you'd have a higher sense of camaraderie with your team-mate as there's only one person to play off of.

Best Use: You only have four people and still feel like a party game.

This game sounds really fun, but is a pretty big letdown.  There's lots of waiting around for all but two of the players, who cautiously bid each other down.  Once the bidding's over, they have 25 words (but usually lots less) to get their team to guess 5 words.  So they say their 12-15 words, and if their team doesn't get it, that's all she wrote.  It's moderately satisfying when your team does get it, but it's not satisfying enough for me to REALLY care.

This is a very enjoyable party game.  It works best with 6 or more people.

One of my favorite party games to play with my friends, especially Maria Gola, the all-time best 25 Words or Less player. I love the bidding process, the planning needed to come up with the most concise clues, and the calm tension that it engenders.

This game often leads to much hair pulling (self and others) in our groups. What should be obvious, at least to the clue giver, may take many words more. Shouldn't "Yorrick" get "Hamlet" from someone? "Fictional Danish prince" is too many words. In close games, the tension can grow quite extreme%u2014in that fun game way, of course%u2014and lead to dramatic blunders.

The game also has a great element of brinksmanship that has led the bidding as low as 6 words in games I have played. And I've been there when 6 words was successful!

My family has turned the Name-That-Tune bidding into the best part of the game. Fun party game, requires attention to the game (at least during your team's turn).

A nice simple friendly game, works best with people who know each other fairly well. Reminds me of Name That Tune.

Like most parlor games, this is highly contingent on the group you are playing with, but that being said, I've yet to play a bad game of 25 Words.  It is a challenging game of word assoications, but what makes it shine is the bidding round and the added difficulty that creates.  Its only drawback is that the bidding can drag a tad, but the other players just need to make sure the bidders keep things moving.  As long as you have some friendly cajoling on the bidding round, this is a fun time.

Variant of the old "Name that Tune" game,"Bid a Note"--the clue givers for each team bid the fewest number of cluewords that they will need give to communicate 5 unrelated words on the card.

Clever game that works quite well.

Woah -- this is really quite a good game.  It's probably even better with larger teams.  Combining bidding with clue giving adds lot of pressure over other Taboo-style games.

RATING: 6
Not too bad! It is the dual of Taboo, and presents a new, and slightly interesting mechanic.

RATING: 7
We have a few problems with some of the words being too American, which means we play or just four of the five words instead of the whole card, which turns into a good variation on Articulate etc

RATING: 6
A decent party game. Not that excited about this since the only 'new' things in this are the bidding and the limited amount of words with which you can describe the word.

My bright/verbal friends LOVE this game.  It IS a different skill set and requires a good vocabulary as it is about getting your team to guess all the words on the list with the fewest hints.

Password is a decent word game, and this similar game takes it up a couple notches. I like the rattling off of words the teammates can do to guess the word with as few as possible word clues. I also really like the addition of a nice tactical element with the bidding system.

A fun party game with the right group.  I hate that phrase, "with the right group" but it applies.  How do you know if your group is "right"?  They need to enjoy word games and it helps if you can pair people of similar (I'm trying hard not to use the word "intelligence" but there it is) as bidding "partners" on opposite teams.  That way the bids are about right for everyone.

The gambling part of the game is flawed. It's possible that you can go a whole game without doing a thing apart from saying "I'll do it in X". Appropriate team selection is crucial.
That said the actual describing part of the game using very few words is great fun.

This is a (more or less) fun little word game.  The rules can be taught in a matter of minutes, and it can accommodate a vast number of players (teams) if necessary.  What's strange about this game is that a team could win without actually getting to play -- the other team always wins the bid and always fails.  Needless to say, it can be somewhat exasperating to "not play a game" for an hour or more.  As an aside, I don't think I've ever played a game of this wherein the opening bid wasn't 10 or lower (generally 6 to 8)

This is really just a take on charades, but not a good one in my opinion. The words they use on the cards are often to difficult to act out for most people which just turns it into an experience that loses any joy it had in a short period of time.

You need 2 big groups for this to be fun. I've tried it with 2 teams of 2 and it grinds to a halt.

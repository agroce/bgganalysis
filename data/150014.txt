I love the auction phase of this game. It is simple but there is a lot of choices to make very early. And the dungeon phase opens up a lot of potential for strategy with the only person scoring points being the one who deals the final blow. This is definitely one I will be trying to get to the table again and again.

Solid fun in quite simple backage. Some cards are clearly better than the others, but randomness is balanced via auction. Short game! Would have wanted to play longer! Pixel art is reallyreally cool. (Must listen chiptune music while playing this.)

I hate that the combat feels like a mere afterthought, because the bidding and deckbuilding are great, they just feel more interesting than the actual "dungeon crawl."  The game devolves into kill stealing, which ruins the good will the game gains right off the bat. Yet i will say the game does have enough charm to be fun once or twice.

Pixel Glory is a deckbuilding game, but not your typical "progressively building up to awesome power" type. 

There's a phase one where you equip spells in town, and a phase two where you go off to fight the monsters with all the other wizards. 

Pros: The neat mechanic of this game is that you're cooperating with other players to beat the monsters, but only the player who deals the killing blow gets the fame (and points) needed to with the game.  So you're simultaneously competing with the other players too, fun times. 

I did like the "auction drafting" mechanic for accumulating spells, ensuring that no one player becomes too powerful.  It also felt a bit like poker with the betting and bluffing.

The handful of monsters your team fights are selected from a larger pool, so there's enough variety each play through.  You can also choose various spell types and strengths to customize your battle strategy.  

Cons: Overall, I think the game is just a bit too simple.  

The monsters you're fighting present pretty much no threat, I feel like this aspect of the game could have been developed a bit more. 

With only one town phase and one dungeon phase, there's no opportunity to go back and adjust or improve your deck.  Monsters don't give any kind of spendable reward when you kill them, so there's no choice presented to kill one monster vs. another.  

The mechanic to save one of your drawn cards for later turn is a good addition, but even with it there didn't feel like there was enough variety to work with, since you're always compelled to use all of the spells you draw. 

I might play it on occasion, but it's not a favorite

Fun little boss monster type deck building game.  Has a couple cool mechanics like the base cards and drafting system but really is very simple.  That being said it is a quick and quirky game that provides excitement until the end for a group of players who don't want to play something too serious.

It took about five minutes to read through the rules and learn the game. It's ridiculously easy to grasp and plays decently with two people without feeling like we're just doubling up on characters (I'm looking at you, Citadels). 

This would definitely be better with a few more players, but it was a solid game all the same. It's not complicated, it doesn't have a myriad of mechanics to make it more difficult, it is just a good 20-30 minutes of side-eyeing your fellow dungeoneers.

I hope that variants pop up to provide more challenging options, or that future expansions provide more depth, but I enjoy it just the way it is.

Too many cards read like they will allow you to trim your deck as you play but the reality is you probably won't get through your deck even twice. Decently fun despite this, although the drafting took longer than the actual dungeon phase of the game, which is annoying since we spent so much time picking the cards out and then not getting to use them except for a couple of times.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I started out thinking this was a cool little game but it ends up being a bit too open/easy and it doesn't quite work for me. The deckbuilding aspect was quite fun, but the dungeon diving wasn't too hard and one could usually kill a monster fairly easily making decisions rather meaningless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the first deck builder I have ever liked. The spellbook building being separate from the dungeon crawling was what I feel helped make this game more to my liking than typical deck builders. I like the feeling like a final fantasy black mage. This game is simple to pick up but complex enough to warrant replay. I really enjoy this game.

This game is well put together. The two separate phases, auctioning to build your deck, and then using that deck to devastate monsters, is fairly well put together. But the premise of trying to be the last person to kill a monster falls flat when it's pretty easy to instakill a monster in a turn, or two if you really fall flat in your draw. 

The basic idea of the second part of the game being that you want to be the one to finish off the most monsters doesn't work because there is no penalty for not doing so unless it lets someone else to do it. You don't get hurt, or lose cards, or anything. It ends up being a tightly built but overall mechanically small game.

I expected much better out of the game. Innovative deck building mechanic with an auction. Great use of basic cards for the deck building. But the dungeon phase of the game was completely broken. The monsters were so weak that you could basically kill one per round, no matter how poorly you drafted cards. The getting the last hit part of the mechanic was inspired, but it just all fell flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The two phase approach (draft card sets then play a short deckbuilder with those cards) sounds good. In practice, it's almost pure luck.  The first half of the game is largely irrelevant, and the second half is more about turn order than luck, and doesn't even come close to being strategic.  You have to attack and only the final blow scores, but you don't know other players' hands, so you make a series of arbitrary choices and hope somebody else accidentally sets you up to score points.

RATING: 9.4
Two phases. Phase 1, the auction. Bid using cards 1-9. the spell card you won and a given number of elemental cards are added to your deck each round. Phase 2, the battle. You and your friends battle monsters. But really, not much of a battle as the players are seemingly invincible arch-wizards and do not take damage. But, it makes for a very enjoyable hack and slash time. S/He who scored the killing blow on the most baddies wins. Funded on KS.

When playing with new players we generally skip the initial auction round and assign spells randomly. This gets people engaged quickly and affords us enough time to play a full game afterward.

I had high hopes for this game as I loved Boss Monster, but this game is actually a little too simple.  There is not enough variety in the cards and I didn't feel as if there was enough strategy even for this light game.  On the plus side the components provided are of excellent quality and the game is easy to set up and teach.  It is possible I may be missing something, but just felt disappointed.

Based on one play, so may go up with further plays.  Pretty easy to learn the mechanics, I did find the auction phase to be not that much fun and a bit perplexing.  But I like the playing the rounds with the interesting choices to be made based on the monsters and the game's hand-management/deck building aspects.  I like Legendary better, but maybe the buy-first fight-later approach of PG will grow on me.

Interesting take on a deck builder

Some of the spells are too situational and take feels a bit to luck dependent.

Cards show wear after first game and the box is a hair too narrow for 3 piles of cards unsleeved.

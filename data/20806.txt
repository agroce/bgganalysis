RATING: 6
Simple filler with a role playing extention in D&D.  I like it just for the sake of the blind bidding and the ability to be able to cash out early from a pot, or even make a profit, should you be able to set off the right dragons in your flight.

Not a good game for two players, as there isn't back-and-forth one would get in a larger game where there are several players to gang up on the alpha dog.  

For 3+ players, I really enjoy it.

Since this is meant to be a gambling game, it has a serious problem with time.  With 2 players, the hands just go back and forth.  It's like being in a poker tournament where the blinds don't change.  It's otherwise not a bad D&D-themed pub game.

RATING: 6
This lies somewhere between mass market appeal and an interesting take on a new card game.  I liked the interaction of the cards and how tricks were scored.  But the game can be so balanced that playing until you bankrupt everyone will take a lot longer than the game's appeal can hold up.  The easy solution is to have less 'cash' up front at buy in.  Finding the right amount is a lot like the right amount for a poker game - too much and the game will drag, too little and people won't bet enough and the game will drag.

Played this game too many times to count, and most of my gaming group love it. Simple, fast, fun, plenty of player interaction, I've found very little to fault it. Plays like loosely D&D themed poker, though you have to supply your own chips. That's disappointing, but if the game gave you the hundreds of tokens you'd need to give each player the money to play, it'd cost a heck of a lot more than the low price for the card deck.

A fun trick taking game that uses chips, rather than cards, for points.  So I guess it is a cross between poker and a trick taking game?  Either way, just enough nerdiness and abit fiddly/wonkiness to keep it off the table, but when it does get some play, there are some card combos and events in the game that make it really fun.  It takes a few games to get the hang of it, and some of the people I have played with hated it out of the gates because the couldn't understand the strategy at first, but whatever.  My wife actually requested to play it recently.  Go figure!

RATING: N/A
Three Dragon Ante is an interesting little D&D based card game. Note that you will need quite a few counters (I got some fancy glass beads in different colors at a craft store) to represent the money in the game. There is quite a bit of give and take in this game as you are trying to balance playing "good" dragons with "evil" dragons and the benefits each dragon gives. Unfortunately, my group didn't really enjoy it so off to the trade pile with you.

A game of bidding and "take that".  Little control.  You are forced to play out almost your entire hand before being able to buy just 2 more measly cards (at a random price).  Then you repeat the process so you usually have 3 or less cards to choose from.  Making matters worse, cards are regularly stolen or forced out of your hand.

This is an engaging Poker- (or Brag-) based game with a D&D skin on it.  It plays well and the tactics are varied and interesting.  I'm afraid that "chip bullying" might be the main order of play, which is one of the aspects of Holdem Poker I've always disliked.  Then again, there are some cards that can radically alter the balance so you could get back in the game very quickly - or lose even more so.  It's usually a quick enough game that the randomness is fine.  However, it can sometimes go on for quite a while, if fortunes change too radically throughout.  Were it not for the unreliable game length, I might actually use this in the manner intended: as a game played by RPG characters...

This is a great little trick-taking/"gambling" game that to my mind is largely overlooked. (The D&D branding may be part of that--serious D&D players dismiss it as superfluous, and everyone else dismisses it as a D&D title.) The game can run long, as some people note, but I've played the heck out of this game, and overall it's not too huge a problem (especially with more players). I've had substantial success introducing this to non-gamers as well as non-D&D-playing gamers.

A little bit of a random game in what cards you draw but immensely fun and simple card game where you are trying to make the biggest flight of dragons but if you play a lower or equal value card then you get to use the ability of the card. 2 Plays.

Not bad on the first few plays (GameStorm 2006). Left me wanting more, so I traded Lost Cities for it.

[i]Update August 2006[/i] - There's something special here. Don't ignore it just because of the D&D tie-in. This game takes poker to a whole new level. My wife took to it immediately on the first play and, much to my despair, has won almost every hand she's played. 6->8

[i]Update December 2006[/i] - None of our gamer friends are really into poker, and since we tend to kick their butts in this on the introductory game we can't get anyone to play it. Takes the fun out of it for us, so it hasn't come off the shelf in awhile. Hoping for more poker-oriented friends someday. 8->7

We use replica Spanish coins (Reales, Escudos, Dubloons, Pieces of Eight..) instead of the whimpy little 1's and 5's markers. The weight and sound of the coins adds SOOO much to the game. The coins are also used in a variety of other games we play.

A fun, light card game with aesthetically pleasing art.  I expected a game as terrible as most franchise spin-offs, but was very pleasantly surprised.

Fun little card game. Players play cards to determine the ante, then over three turns each player will play cards that allow them to take from/add to the pot, take cards and/or money from other players, etc. while still trying to play the highest total card values to win (what's left of) the pot. Pretty high screwage factor as there are some fun cards to pull out when someone things they have a hand wrapped up.  My only complaint is that it seems easier to pull money from the pot than put it in, but that might be resolved with more players.

Pleasantly surprised by this and I'll gladly play it any time.

Playing high-value cards puts the player in the running to win the pot. Low-value cards trigger special powers, but due to the weakness of those powers, as compared playing high-value cards to win the pot, it feels unbalanced. The game does not present many interesting decisions and players are bound heavily to the luck of the draw. Maybe it could be fun if you played for money, but even then, there are no worthwhile systems in place to warrant this or capitalize on it. Might be fun if you were drunk, but you would be faced with the nail-biting decision of whether to play this or [i]Monopoly[/i].

Surprisingly good D&D themed card game.  I would advise that you don't necessarily play to the defined end game though as we've ended up with the game taking well over 3 hours before doing that as the same player went into and out of debt 4 or 5 times before finally succumbing to fate.  Luckily this is a game that can be stopped easily after any round without ruining the game at all.

I bought this game because my girlfriend was playing in a tournament for charity and it seem like fun. While I do enjoy playing this, it feels like with a lot of people it is quite hard to actually finish a game. Often times we play for a time limit instead of till when people lose their gold because we want it to actually finish. Interesting game though, and the concept is also nice. I can see this as being a fun addition to a DnD campaign.

[COLOR=#FF0000][b]2-6 players[/b][/COLOR]

My longtime D&D playing brother likes this game.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00]House rules:[/BGCOLOR]

[b]Two players:[/b] Bronze dragon only takes 1 ante card. Without this, it reduces the value of the strength special flights as often there aren't any ante cards left. It can happen with 3 or more players as well but not nearly as frequently as in a two player game.


[b]Game limit:[/b] Rather than playing a set amount of time or number of rounds, we play X times through the deck. For two players, X = 2 and for 3 players X = 3. Haven't played with more than that so I am not sure whether X = number of players would work or not but it works well for 2 and 3 players.

When you reach the end the last time through you still shuffle the discards if someone needs more cards but the last card handed out signals the the current gambit is the final one.


[b]Card buying:[/b] As with any card game, there is a healthy dose of luck involved. How much one pays to buy cards can be a huge factor and is totally determined by luck and seems a bit much. I have seen too many games that were decide by the random card cost alone. 

One person paying 2 or 3 twice and somone else paying 12 or 13 twice is just such a huge swing. Paying 12 twice is almost 50% of the starting stack whereas paying 2 twice is less than 10%. That is just such a significant difference it can decide a game by itself. 

I play cards cost 6 gold every time.

A somewhat quick, light-hearted card game with some chance (luck of the draw) and some strategy (building a flight & thinking ahead to later flights). It's very fun.

The game seems to have a very high luck factor. Not much strategy you can employ it's either you have low cards so you try to get chips or you have high cards and go for the pot. If you get a power set (wild luck) your payout it increased by the number of players.

Nov 12, 2007 - I didn't find it much of a "gambling" game as it is marketed.  It is more of a trick taking game where the strength of your three cards is used to deterimine if you take the trick.  The special abilities added complexity, depth, but mostly randomness (luck of the draw, especially for some of the good dragons). 1 play, 5 players, 6/10.

A decent card game with suits and straights pulled out of the full set of Good and Evil dragons. The game itself is quite a bit of fun, although the scoring situation with the game ending when 1 player runs out of chips or whatever, doesn't really feel like it works perfectly to me. It seems like a very elegant card game with great mechanics, with a shot-gun marriage forced scoring system and victory condition.
I still highly recommend it.

First, this has nothing to do with poker. Poker is a bluffing game with escalating bets while this is a fixed initial bet. Second: the rules specify ending the game with the first player out of cash for a reason. Ignore that rule at your peril.

Not a bad game, really, but a bit too chaotic for a gambling game. When chips are at stake I expect a bit more control. The theme is either a plus or a minus depending on how you feel about D&D -- I can't stand the D&D world, really, so the theme proved a liability overall. Would be improved by alcohol.

An interesting card game but it seems like some of the cards are far too powerful and it also seems like it could drag on for a long time depending on the cards, so luck will probably play too much of a part in my view.

Gambling game with outdated and flawed design, where laying three of a kind is often better than winning the round. Very random and chaotic. Unbalanced powers. Potential to last forever. Bland artwork. Players have to provide the game money. It can't get much worse.

RATING: 6
A not-bad social cardgame for [i]D&D[/i] nerds (like me).  Supposedly a game played for stakes, but far too chaotic for that.  You're better off playing 20-deck Baccarat.  It's impossible to bring skill to bear—there are something like 11 suits and each one has a unique distribution of card values.  So it's impossible to keep track of what's been played and have that information inform your future play.  That makes it primarily a game of chance with almost no opportunities for skill.  Not that that's all bad.  It's just that no one in their right minds should confuse this with Poker...

With the right group it can be a fun, chaotic post-[i]D&D[/i] session night-ender.

Nevertheless, if someone suggested it I'd be keen to play.

It's actually pretty decent, but can take too long - a 30-minute game is amazing, a 2-hour one just gets tiresome.

Edit: I have trouble finding the original boxes, so if you buy this you'll get it in a 400-card BCW box.

RATING: 7
Fun card game.  

To me the only gambling part is when you play the card for your ante. If you have a strong hand and you will put in a large ante card so the pot will be large.  If you have a weaker hand you will use a low card for your ante so you do not have much in the pot.  

My wife & I enjoyed it so much I am thinking seriously of purchasing the game.

Fun, chaotic and pretty damn random too so a lethal mix, something Bruno F would have designed.  Runaway leader possible or at least if someone gets ahead it can be very tough to catch them.

It's been a while since I played this, but I seem to remember liking it.  It's basically a poker variant with some interesting mechanisms.  I do not expect it to hit the table again any time soon, but it's a nice small box so it can still have a space in my collection.  Also, in case I pick up D&D again, I'd like to have it around for side session gaming in the tavern.  The game is simple enough to play with just about anyone, which is nice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is more fun than I thought it would be.  I got it because of the dragons and the D&D tie-in, not so much because I thought it would be a good game.  I introduced it as part of a D&D session, and I was kind of disappointed when we had to set it aside to get back to the adventure.

It's not a bad game but I would have liked to have more, or different ways to play. The idea of the special ability is interesting.

Not a bad light card game. It wants to be a pub game, and there's chips involved, but there are no provided mechanics for wagering other than just throwing money in at the beginning. This is unfortunate because such a mechanic is vital to making this an interesting game. As it is, high cards just plain win, except for the rare occasion when low cards win. Something needs to happen to make players with mid-range cards part of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The game is overly complex for what it is. Too many rules to explain, too many special cases and too many dragon powers. This makes it too long to learn and many players won't be willing to invest the time necessary to understand it. It's a shame because Three-Dragon Ante allows for spectacular twists of fate and flows quite well after a few gambits. Extra point for the beautiful cards.

This is a simple game where card powers only fire if you play card that is equal to or less than the card previously played.  Game starts by putting a card in the ante and highest number is what all players pay to the ante.  You typically play three cards and highest value wins the pot.  But there are plenty of ways to "steal" from the pot with evil dragons and get more cards with good dragons.  

I like the game a lot.  But you play for a set time or if you go through the deck twice.  It is family friendly but you need poker chips to play the game.

Like poker, but with more variability, pretty art and fun.  But WHY did they have to make it so that the red suit has a 12, a 10 and like two other numbers?  I don't like that it really helps if you memorize which cards are in each suit and how many of each number there are.  Bah.  But the cards are awesome, and I still like playing.  Just wish that element could have been eliminated.

Played it once at a FLGS with my SO.  I can see it being a lot more fun with more people (probably optimal with 3-4), but it was still pretty fun with 2.  Excellent dragon artwork.  I love the fact that even if you have a weak hand, there are weak dragons that can help you later or force the other players to lose cards/gold.  Ended up getting clobbered by my SO.  Will definitely purchase this in the future!

Edit: Was more fun with more people.  Played with 5.  A bit chaotic but still fun.  Probably better with 3-4.

Maybe I'm missing something, but it seemed pretty random and pointless to me.

The cards are nice, though, and I suppose that it might be okay if you were playing D&D.

The game was a lot better than I thought. It is essentially a poker variant where players play 3 cards like trick-taking style. Leading the trick guarantees the execution of special power. Otherwise you must play the lower numbered card to execute the septical power. This gives me a feeling somewhat similar to Witches Brew but WB is a better game.

The game ending condition is just terrible. Until someone bankrupt? The game doesn't have enough convergent factor for such a rule.

Passable but I could play it time to time.

I'm not one for gambling games much, but this was interesting enough to keep me entertained for the few games I have played, and if anyone shows interest I'd open it up again without a fight. 

Better than that, there was also a Dragon Magazine article that used this as a random D&D character generator, and probably the best one I've come across since it gives the generated characters direction for their personality as well! Very interesting, if not part of the actual game rules itself!

It does what it needs to do. A great little filler game, with much of the feeling of poker mixed with the mechanics of Magic.

RATING: 5
As a game goes, it's fine, with some cute gameplay and easily digested mechanics.  As a card game with special powers, well...

These games where the cards have powers are almost never worth it, as I never play them with the same people enough times so that you don't get a bunch of questions.  It's like Euchre.  If I got twenty questions about "wait, which one's the bower?" and "why does jack beat king?" all the time, I'd get tired of it.  But Euchre has been ingrained in the local boys' memories, so I don't have to deal with those questions every time we pull it out.  In this game, the questions like "what the ante cards do?" or "Wait, what's three of a kind do again?"  and "are metals colors?" are just too persistent, and the game will never be played enough to get to that Euchre level of comfort.

That's why it gets a five.  If I played it solely with people that were totally into it, I'd give it a 6, due to worry that the endgame might take too long in occasional instances.

A good card game which keeps a nice flow going which might be due to the fact that it feels very much like a traditional card-game which clearly seems to have been the intention. Simple rules, flexibility in the decks and high re-playability as well as multiple ways of going about winning make this a very slick and enjoyable game. HX

RATING: 7
Was unable to play this on day of purchase for lack of chits, chips, or stones to serve as a betting pool.  Poor form to make a game and not include something in the way of counters.  

It's visually appealing, and the game has some wild swings in advantage. The mechanics are easily manageable.  It would have been received with more enthusiasm if the game didn't need to be shortened in our estimation. In Fairness, the rulebook prints some alternative rules to address this, but it was tough to continue playing under the rules were given unvarnished before any tweaks were applied.

Horrible. I mean, very nice looking and the rules look good but in practice the game is no fun at all.
You never have enough cards in hand to create combinaisons and the game drags on and on and on. Maybe starting with more cards and playing a fixed number of rounds could help a little.

RATING: 4
Played a 6 player game that was over fairly quickly (30~45) minutes.  Comments made were that fewer players is longer play time (2 hours for a 3 player game was mentioned).  Concerns I have with the game are too much reliance on luck of the draw (initial hand, cost to get more cards) for what the game is - playing 3 card tricks hoping to gain money - but only drawing 2 each round.  Getting additional cards requires the aforementioned variable purchase and/or certain cards - not a guarantee.  Rating might go up with additional plays and a better feel for timing/pacing of the game.  Especially as the results of the first game had the 2 beginners finishing 5th and 6th.  But something just not clicking with me on the game - inital impression is just OK.  I think it is that I found very little "choice" in what cards were the correct cards to play.  Perhaps that is a feeling as I never once had enough high points to compete for the pot - so was just an active observer the whole game.

I find this game to be enjoyable, but also somewhat tiring, and it's not necessarily a game I would go to frequently (especially if there are other options). I can't decide if more players would help or hurt things, but with three things definitely seem to drag.

RATING: 5.5
Another wagering game that uses *some* poker mechanics (flush and 3 of a kind). At heart, this game, inspired by a game from the D&D world, has players using a hand of 3 cards to win the pot. 

The ante is set at the start: players choose a card and reveal it. The highest card is the ante and gives that player the chance to activate the special abilities on cards. Cards are split into several suits and range from 1 to 13. If you're not the ante winner, you can only trigger the cards special effects if you play a card lower than the one just played before you. Each turn, players play one card and the hand/flight is over after 3 cards. The highest total wins the pot (unless a card effect says otherwise).

However, iun reality, the game can drag with money see-sawing back and forth. Eliminated players are out completely. Each and every card has a special effect. This slows gameplay down alot with players constantly looking at their cards and other cards on the table. It might have been better if only some cards had special powers (perhaps the lower cards have special powers and the high cards don't?).

The artwork looks clumsy but the cards are of a nice size (almost tarot sized with nicely rounded sides).

RATING: 7
Another luck-dependant game. A big minus was that you have to get chips/coins somewhere to represent game gold, which didn't come with the game. Best with 4-5 players, as some cards are quite poor with less players. Other than that, enjoyable.

RATING: 6
[Wizards of the Coast 2005 edition] {Beer&Pretzels, D&D; betting, hand-management; optimal 3-5p} I used to play D&D games during my high school. Thus, D&D related games are attractive for me.  So I bought Three-Dragon Ante without hesitation.  It's an ok fun beer-and-pretzel game. It's mildly chaotic with a nice mix of luck and tactics. Depends on the style of the players, sometimes a game may really drag on for more than hour (which is too long for what it is). It may take a game or two to understand the power of the cards. It's not difficult to explain the rule but I prefer more summary cards.

The illustration of the card is stunning. The box is specially designed; however, its non-standard size makes it difficult to pack. The special-shaped cards are interesting.  It may be difficult to distinguish the color of the cards in weak lights and it may not be suitable for color-blind players. Finally, this game has a quite strong English barrier.

RATING: N/A
A good game. I'd call it a 6.5 rather than a 6, but I'm not sure the game is wholly deserving of a 7.  To its credit, 3DA plays well enough for a card game and the different betting strategies are interesting and make play of even a forgone round somewhat engaging.

RATING: 6.5
A very luck heavy light-hearted poker variant. Not bad at all, if taken to be a silly, quick filler.

Rule book is terrible though.

Update: The game is meant to end when one player is out of money at the end of a round, but if the player is desperate to hold on, can almost always get back to 1 or 2 money by playing evil dragons and so prolong the game indefinitely. A round limit (which is a suggested variant in the rule book) is definitely required here.

Rating down from 7.1 to 6.5.

I'm always up for some Three-Dragon Ante. It's fun to play a poker meets Uno meets D&D game. It's also easy enough to learn that it can be pulled out at gatherings where most players aren't familiar with fantasy, D&D, or board gaming at all. Every time I've pulled this game out to play with friends has been a success with positive reviews all around. People may not love it, but they certainly don't dislike it.

Three-Dragon Ante is a fast-paced noncollectable card game based on the games of chance played by characters within the D&D game world. Three-Dragon Ante can be played as a standalone card game when there isn't enough time for a full-fledged D&D adventure, or it can be played as part of a roleplaying campaign-where the abilities of each player´s character give him or her a unique winning edge.

I'm not a huge fan of trick taking games. There's no particular thing I don't like about them, I just haven't had enough exposure for them to have garnered my interest. I picked this one up on a whim. I had a 40 percent off coupon for a bookstore that also sold a few games, Three-Dragon Ante being among them. I expected the game to be a half-baked gimmick, since it was designed to be used within Dungeons and Dragons role-playing game. It comes with rules for using RPG character skills to affect the real world card game, so as a stand alone game I wasn't expecting much. After our first play, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was a heck of a good game. The oversized cards are kind of irritating to shuffle, but other than that, I have absolutely no complaints. I look forward to getting the expansion!

An interesting fantasy poker game, like a cross between blackjack and Colossal Arena. 

Between thieving from the pot, or building up your hand for successive rounds, it can sometimes benefit you to lose a hand, and that's a great element. Each hand plays quickly, and it'd be possible to keep a running tab of points/chips so games could be held over for multiple game sessions, or used as the ultimate filler.

Pickomino has a little brother!  Easier to play by a little, and still just as heart-pounding.  Rating may rise later...

Update: Upgraded to an 8.  So easy to play and always exciting.  I just wish there wasn't (what is essentially) player-elimination.

Pick an area, roll the dice. Rolled what is needed, than the card is yours. That's it.

Nice dice. Game played with my 5 year old son. 

Little to no entertainment.

It sets out to be a quick game, and it accomplishes it. Fine for a quickie while waiting for other to make it, but it will neither succeed nor was it intended to be the main attraction of the day.

20 minutes of fast loud dice rolling fun! Definitely not the deepest of games but it has a few decisions and is a lot of fun. I taught my family in about 1 minute and everyone got into the spirt of things very quickly. Hopefully the gamers like it too for a small diversion.

The gamers love it! It's quick, fun and loud. All the exciting bits of a risk game in a very short playing time. Australia FTW!

RATING: 5
I was pretty interested in this one after reading about it and seeing it on a table.  Kinda enjoyed the play, but with a competitive 4P group I thought it really wore out its welcome length-wise with all of the tug-of-war takebacks against current leaders.  Teachable and playable, I just don't think I care for it.

Dice rolling greatness! Good to see this finally reprinted so it can reach a bigger audience. Roll dice to get symbols (soldiers, cannons, etc.) to claim countries. Countries can be stolen from you until you get all of a continent which also scores you bonus points. This is just fun in a bowl. Highly recommended.

A must own if a Risk collector.  This fun game can be completed in 20 minutes.  Likely best with more than 2 players.  I would not play with the alternate rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely my favorite of the Express line of games.  It gives me the slight world domination feel that I enjoy from Risk and all in about 20 minutes or less.  The trash-talk seems to flow freely.  I also like the game design of giving bonus points and locking in continents when you win all the areas of that continent.  It tends to keep things moving and will end the game quicker.  

Some people will take issue with the fact that there seems to be only one real decision per turn (choosing which region to attack.)  There actually are more decisions as you roll through your turn, because you can only fill one row per turn, so you have to choose which to keep if you complete more than one.  It also should be held to only 4 players no matter what the rulebook says, because with more it will drag on way too long.

This is an all dice rolling simple version of the old Risk game that plays in just around 20 minutes.  A surprisingly good little game and a part of the Hasbro Express line of games.  The only problem is that it is unavailable in the United States and can be found only in Europe for some reason where the price is outrageously high at nearly $40.00 where all other games by this line are available here for only $10.00 go figure.

RATING: 5
Yet another game in the long line of roll-keep-reroll dice games, where players are trying to roll certain combos.

In this case, players are trying to roll combos to take over countries.  Take over all the countries of one continent, and you get to lock those countries in for points.  Until you get all countries in a continent, however, they can be stolen by opponents!  Oh noes!

The game ends when all countries have been conquered, and the player with the most points worth of conquests (as dictated by numbers on the countries) wins.

As a quick filler I would have found this quite enjoyable, but it does seem to go on for longer than the 20 minutes it is supposed to take.

As a result, this would be fairly down on my list of games to play. However, I think it does have a place as a pub or travel game, due to its simplicity and portability.

I finally manufactured my own copy of this game.  I will still purchase it if it becomes available.  In fact, I have a friend that is travelling to Germany this year and she will buy it for me if she sees it.

I used the rectangular poker sized cards provided by SiskNY for my template, but I modified the dice areas to conform with images from the actual dice.  I had a dickens of a time aligning the obverses and reverses of the cards, but finally managed it.  I then printed and laminated the cards.  I used wooden dice with stickers for the dice set.  The stickers are images of the actual dice faces.  I purchased some plastic dice from Hasbro (from the Clue Express game) but they only send 4 dice for that game.  I would have bought them from the Battleship Express game, but the customer service page did not provide the order form for them.  Those dice use stickers as well, but having only 4, they were too few to play the game.  I am reasonably content with the wooden dice.  I also purchased a wooden bowl ($2.99) and put red felt inside.  I will post pictures soon.

WHY WON'T HASBRO SELL THIS GAME IN THE UNITED STATES?!?

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español]** Es tan azaroso como el Pickomino pero muy divertido. Muchas veces hay una gran tensión en la última tirada, que acaba en un !qué potra! Muy buenos componentes, tiene interacción entre los jugadores, y el tema es del RISK.

Se tiran 7 dados, uno menos que en el Pickomino, la gran diferencia es que en el Express la primera tirada es fundamental, luego las demás no tanto, en el Pickomino son todas mas o menos importantes, lo malo es que en el de los gusanos hay mucho robo de piezas y algo de caos, también se suele hacer más pesado si se alarga.

En el Risk Express parece que Australia es bastante difícil de conseguir, tengo la sensación de que como quede la última no va a salir nada rápido y de que se puede hacer demasiado largo para lo que es el juego, si no se hace la regla casera de que cuando falte un continente por conseguir se acaba el juego, si es el de Ocenia, o si se acaban todos.

Mucho mejor jugado con la regla opcional de poder mantener los dados de un jugador a otro, le subo un punto con esta variante.[/COLOR]

Players roll dice to try and conquer areas of the globe, based on the Risk boardgame.  Players roll a bunch of dice and can assign them to a country they want to "invade" - countries are represented by cards, and dice have to fill out the various rows of battle results.  Once a card is full, the country is taken for points.  Countries of other players can be invaded, which are slightly tougher take.  Excellent little die rolling filler, great packaging and presentation.  The game play is very similar to Knizia's Heckmeck/Pickonimo, and that's no bad thing.

I like Risk Express for what it is..., a light dice roller, fun for 10 Euro's or 15 USD, but this is not a full game for "full" money...
Nothing a gaming group will play all evening long or instead a game of Britania, Ikusa, Shogun or other classic Risk games... 
I like the theme and artwork but come'on, I'll buy this for 15 bucks, not for 40 bucks...

Risk Express - rating a 8 (reduced over the time),
Age of War - full price game - rating a 4 ...or less!

I really like this little filler. I've heard it compared to Pickomino, but they're really not too similar. Yes, you roll dice. Yes, you save some and reroll some. Yes, you can steal other people's stuff. They don't really play anything alike though. As much as I like Pickomino, I really like Risk Express more. There's more interaction between players, and there's more tension as you try to get the rolls you need. Too bad it's not available in the US. If you like little dice fillers like this, it's definitely worth the import.

After many many plays, this is easily my favorite dice game.

Quick dice filler somewhat similar to Pickomino and certainly one of the best games of its class. Results are probably about as meaningful as in real Risk but the time investment required is much much lower.

Only one night of play, and ultimately a dice fest, yet holds a bit of promise to being slightly more than it is (17/12/08). UPDATE: Hmmm, has sat on the shelf now for 6 years since last play! (rating 6.147, Feb 15). UPDATE: Quick little game, its actual a good little game and worthy of a > 7 rating. I like the fact its a repeat dice rolling mechsnism that is NOT the Yahtzee mechanism.  Would like to try with more than two (Rating, 7.189, March 2015).

Solid quick little dice game in the 'Express' series.  I am a fan of Monopoly Express and Risk Express is a good game as well.  Sadly, Risk Express isn't available in the US for some reason, but maybe it will make it here eventually.  For the record, I think I prefer Monopoly Express a little more, but both are fine games.  The optional rule in Risk Express might be worth following, otherwise it might drag a little longer.  Both Monopoly Express and Risk Express are more fun than the Catan dice game.

Maybe the best one out of Hasbro Express line but still nothing more than a Risk themed Yahtzee meets Pickomino.
Only acceptable as a light filler or introductory reasons. However it has nice quality dice and a useful bowl when playing better dice games like King of Tokyo.

It doesn't offer as many choices as, say, Pickomino (also by Knizia), but it's got an awesome theme and has brilliant packaging. The box is a dice bowl. That bears repeating, so I will repeat it.
The _box_ is a _dice_ _bowl_. How awesome is that?

[Initial Impression: 3]
Even though it takes much longer, I find the original Risk more enjoyable, but perhaps that's just the nostalgia talking. Rolling dice once every 2 minutes or so for 20 minutes is Not My Idea Of Fun. Of course, I'm probably not the target audience. The game gives you the appearance of choice (which territory to go for on a turn, which dice to keep on a roll, if any), but even when its a real choice (one general or one cannon or one cavalry is not a choice), it is inconsequential or obvious. I would've expected more interesting twists in a Knizia dice game.

Oct08: Meh.  I am surprised it didn't get released in the USA, since it's better than crap.  (And much better than Battleship from reading those rules.)

However, there aren't a *ton* of decisions to be made.  You get one decision per turn, which country to attack.  That's it.  And that's not really enough to make a game for me.

The theme actually is somewhat there.  You are attacking countries and taking them over.  If you lock a continent it becomes safe and scores a bonus.

However, it's just not there for me.  Even Monopoly Express had many more decisions than this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Ideal Players: 3-6

Description: Roll dice to take over countries. Risk Express captures the spirit of traditional Risk in a much shorter play time. Players don't worry about soldiers, only rolling the right combination of dice.

Pro: Quick and easy. Very well balanced. Great pictures on the dice. Neat round country cards.

Con: Completely random. Very little strategy.

A quick, fun dice/set collecting game. Has a good balance of "push your luck" and "screw your neighbor elements."

Rolling for Australia will be a cause for joy or much profanity. You've been warned!

RATING: 7
When you read the rules this hardly seems like a game, but in practice this is actually one of Knizia's better dice games.  It plays very quickly and the components are quite nice - I like the dice bowl and the very heavy duty dice.  Not being familiar with Risk, I would imagine that this feels quite different, though in my opinion it seems to maintain at least some of the spirit of the original game.  For some reason certain combinations seem really hard to get.  I would definitely prefer this to Pickomino, though Easy Come, Easy Go is enjoyable as well.

Having played most of the 'express' games I have to agree with many that this is the best of the lot. It plays slightly differently every time, which is just a fluke of how the dice rolling works out, particularly on the first few turns because that sets much of the tone for the rest of the game. Surprisingly, there is a reasonable chance to 'come back' from a loss condition, and attacking other people's territory is just plain fun.

A problem with the game is that it may go long.

Un jeu de dés de Knizia. Bon, c'est bien plus proche du Yam que du Risk, mais ses règles simples et ses parties dynamiques et interactives font de lui un très sympathique jeu de dés (mais qui ne révolutionne pas grand chose). La boite servant de piste est très agréable à utiliser.

I played this for the first time at the ‘Knziathon’ to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Great Reiner run at a local games store (Jolt Games in Mitchell). It was pretty much what I expected, a heap of dice rolling and a bit of fun. The first game, with adults, was okay but really didn’t grab me – probably fair to say that it was a bit too long and outstayed its welcome.

I played again later with the Little Fish and they really enjoyed the game. We played without the ability to take areas from other players and the boys liked rolling dice and then matching them up to suit the different areas that were still up for grabs.

So, not a bad game and one that while I wouldn’t rush to play again it’s one that I would happily sit down with and play with the boys. I might consider purchasing if I see a cheap set somewhere or even get Age of War which, I understand, is pretty much the same thing but cheaper as it doesn't come packed in the 'roll bowl.'

A dice game by the good doctor, and (shocker) I enjoyed it quite a bit. It's very simple, and I could see the endgame tuning into a stalemate if no one goes after the middle territories, but players in the lead have every reason to try to end the game, so maybe it's not an issue. Basically it's competitive Elder Sign.

Here we move into the multiple re-roll, one player at a time category. And without the cleverness of To Court The King's dice manipulation to at least make your turn interesting. After the first roll, you choose a VP card to shoot for. Each card has a series of combos, each of which must be satisfied on a different roll. You'll obviously fill one of the criteria on the card you choose, so then pick up the remaining dice and try to meet the next, losing a die each time you miss out. Repeat. And then make the game go interminably by allowing the players to steal cards from other players instead of going for the cards in the middle. No need to explore this further.

This quickly becomes unfun.

This time the battles are fought over the territories that will be familiar to Risk players; capturing a territory scores points, capturing a continent scores more points and makes it safe from being taken by another player.  Fast, lightweight fun, and my current favourite dice game.

Oddly, it took almost 2 full 2-player games before "getting" the full gameplay and most strategy. While seemingly simple, the mechanics and probabilities take a bit of practice to see how they play out. After 3 games, it's a compelling game - would love to play more, and see how it changes with more players.
It worked great with my wife (of course she roundly trounced me, but she said she liked it and not only because of that). It's funny - we don't have many 2-player games, and this is a nice quick one we can get thru after the boys go to bed.

Printed out Malechi's incredible Heroscape-themed version, and just used standard dice -  it worked great!  :thumbsup:

The best of the "express" games.  As strategic a dice game as you can get.  I had nothing but this in a hospital waiting room with two kids for a week (aged 7 and 15) and it kept us well occupied.  Great for kids who are at an age where they still think they can influence die rolls through sheer will power.  Lots of laughter and taunting.

Fun fun fun Yahtzee meets Pickomino dicefest. Players roll dice trying to match symbols on 'continent' cards to take them. You can also attack other players' cards. If you conquer the entire continent, no other player can take it from you. The game is over when all continents are won.

Dice and box are great but the cards are sadly, ultrathin and will wear out quickly. Laminate or sleeve them if you play this often. Great filler and probably best played when drunk! TAKE AUSTRALIA!

Fun dice game even if you're not that into dice games.  Or Risk for that matter.  (I have vaguely fond memories of Risk, but my 10 year-old's one prior Risk experience left her wary of trying this one.  Then I said the magic word...Knizia!)

Much better than Pickomino. Not tedious. And it does, somehow, manage to capture the megalomania (and/or tendency to narrativize) that Risk brings out in some players.  

Expensive in the US because it's an import.  Nice as a travel game though.

RATING: 6.5
Another of the Hasbro 'Express' games, designed by Reiner Knizia.  This one is quite fun, rolling 7 dice with different military symbols on them, and then placing the dice on cards that represent countries/continients being invaded.  Neat additional rules reducing the number of dice when a roll is unsuccessful, and countries you've won being at risk of attack until you have conquered the whole continent, add colour and interest.  A little bit of basic-level strategy in amongst all the random luck.  Some fun for kids and for adults, and can be quite tense as you are trying to complete a 'line' to get the card or complete the continent.  Well-produced, again in a durable 'travel' container that doubles as the dice bowl.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are disks showing various parts of the world, color-coded according to their continent. Each shows what you need to roll (some combination of symbols) to conquer it. They're initially in a pool, but you can also take them from other players (harder roll than from center of table). However, once one player has all disks from a continent, the disks can no longer be taken away (they also score bonus VP). The game ends when all disks are taken. Each disk is worth x VP ... most VP wins.

Yet another in the string of Yahtzee-like games (e.g., Pickomino, Settlers Dice Game) but this time with a Risk theme and more player interaction. Do I need a Risk theme? No.

I'm a big fan of Risk (just don't tell anyone on the Geek) and Risk Express does an impressively clever job of simulating Risk in a fraction of the time.  It's actually quite strategic despite all the dice and a blast to play.  It wasn't until after the game I discovered it's by Knizia-should have guessed!  I have to get this game!

RATING: 8
Keep as many dice in play as you can!  This is fun and gets exciting towards the end.  You can see where this is by Knizia.  I play with the variant that you can choose to keep trying for a territory the previous player failed to conquer.  The dice bowl is great and I use it for most other dice-rolling games.  And it really does play in 20 minutes if you play with 3 or 4 players.  It shares the point-stealing mechanic of Pickomino but the dice-rolling is different and I like this a whole lot more than Pickomino.  Unclear from the German translation if you play until every card is part of a continent, or just until there are no longer any free territories in the center of the table (might still be some in front of players).  You need as many or more infantry on the dice to win an infantry frontline.

Take over the world in your lunch break!

It's surprisingly different from Risk, but has the same feel. There is now an element of 'Should I try and take a new territory or do I try and take the (harder) territory away from someone else?" as completed continents are locked down and can't be lost.

The 2 times we played (5 and 6 player I think?) the first player won both times... I'm assuming that is a fluke...

Risk Express was one of the two games that I played with two nice guys from the Pacific Northwest while waiting in the registration line at the convention (the other being Hamsterolle). We didn’t quite finish Risk Express before registration opened and we had to pack it up, but I think I got the gist of the game. It’s a Knizia dice game that employs the sort of risk management (no pun intended) you’d expect from a Knizia dice game. It’s a decent enough game that achieves exactly what it sets out to do... don’t Knizia games achieve that more often than not? However, it’s not the sort of game I can see myself feeling like playing very often. It was perfect for waiting in line, but thankfully I don’t find myself waiting in lines like that frequently.

A quick dice game that offers no modifiers or special actions during play. Just pick a continent to conquer, roll the dice pictured on it line by line (an original mechanic later re-used in Elder Sign) and hope that no one steals it back from you. Quick enough to be enjoyable - just do not use the box for rolling the dice in, because the noise will drive you crazy.

Light dice rolling exercise that somehow keeps the essence of Risk (in capturing countries and turning them into continents to protect them) whilst keeping play between 30 to 40 minutes. Does have the potential to go on interminably however, if the leading player can't take the last country.

This is what a dice game should be (fun!). It plays fast, passing a handful of dice around the table and with only a single but engaging choice to be made after your first roll. The rerolls provide the tension, cheers and groans. Thematically there are some nice references to the classic boardgame.

It's a dice game with choices, and isn't strictly a Yahtzee remake.  That's a +2 bonus if I've ever seen one.  The good news is that the choices, the more-than-three-rolls rule, and the interaction between players makes this a dice game with some staying power.  The bad news is that with two players, it's too easy for players to get a run on the continents, and with four, too much seems to happen between your turns to stay terribly competitive.  I would think that three players is the sweet spot for the game.

In addition to the normal risk-reward situation of a push-your-luck game, Risk Express gives you an additional risk in the sense that if you try to get a country from another player and fail, you take a double hit, from not taking their country away from them, and for not gaining anything else on your turn for that round.  On the other hand, if you get far behind in the game, taking territories from other players is your best bet for prolonging the length of the game and taking points away from someone else while gaining your own.  It's subtle, but effective.

I love the Hasbro Express games, and this might be my favorite of the bunch.  There's probably a little bit of sentimentality to that since I bought it on my amazingly fun trip to Germany, but there's no question that it's a good dice game.

There's one graphic design issue with the Canadian territory, where the depiction of the requirements for capturing it from an opponent are misleading, but once you know about it, it's not an issue.  Other than that, the production quality is outstanding.  Definitely better than all of the Express games here in the U.S, with the possible exception of Monopoly Express.

One of the better dice games that I own.  Great with kids, and easy to pack up and break out on travel holidays.

[i]Update:[/i]

Elder Sign has similar mechanics, but is the better game.  Importantly, ES avoids the endgame issues that plague Risk Express: endless stealing attempts, obvious kingmaking (intentional or not), and the inability of the likely winner to finish the game by taking the last card.

However, stealing/attacking is usually more fun than cooperation, and Risk Express is significantly shorter and easier to set up than ES.  So it all balances out, ratings-wise.

Note: Risk Express has been repackaged by Fantasy Flight as [i]Age of War[/i], so it's now available stateside.

Played once (with 3 players). A pleasant surprise - this game can really be played in 20 minutes or so (although I can imagine it could drag on a bit if players keep going for their opponents' countries), and it does not feel too long. Of course it is random, since most of the time is spent rolling dice, but there are some decision and risk-taking (mainly because of the asymmetric role of the infantry). It remains very light, but it is a good alternative to Heckmeck - and offers more player interaction than the Settlers dice game.

Compact, simple, resonably-lengthed and could be confrontational if you choose to be.  Took most of the "fun" parts (it's all relative of course) of the original game and condensed it into a neat package.  Why play Risk when you can do it the express way?

RATING: 6.5
Simple, suspenseful die-rolling.  Making your initial roll, and then committing to a territory provides very interesting choices.  It's all luck of the roll beyond that choice - well, choosing which dice to commit to the card is technically a choice, but it's fairly perspicuous which you should choose from a statistical standpoint.  Simple and suspenseful.  For those who are itching to try this, but dismayed that it's not in your country, download the 7dice file from the file section.  :^)

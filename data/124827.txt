Based on one play, with another player and the designer teaching it to us. Might revise upwards with more plays. It was fun, but once we got the hang of it, it was basically a random dungeon-crawl - the party goes through the ship, picking up equipment and shooting aliens, making a few tactical/resource decisions now and then as to where to allocate shots and dice. Cooperation certainly affects play, but much of it comes down to die rolls. Also, like most cooperative games, seems easily subverted by an "alpha player."

ETA: After two plays, I think this game definitely goes on too long, and is just too much random dice rolling to shoot random monsters who appear and then pick up random items.

Το Away Missions είναι άλλο ένα συνεργατικό dungeon crawler με μπόλικες μινιατούρες και tiles. Έχει Sci-fi θέμα που σε γυρνάει στα παλιά και κλασσικά retro sci-fi comics των 60’s. Πιο αθώες εποχές.  Από πλευράς παραγωγής έχουμε όπως είπα πάρα πολλές μινιατούρες (100+):surprise: αλλά δεν είναι στα επίπεδα ποιότητας και λεπτομέρειας της FFG. Παρόλα αυτά δουλεύουν μια χαρά.

Το παιχνίδι υποστηρίζει μέχρι και 6 άτομα και περιέχει 20 σενάρια τα οποία έχουν ένα συνεχόμενο story αλλά δεν υποστηρίζουν campaign σύστημα με level up και τα ρέστα. Οπότε μπορείτε να παίξετε όποιο σενάριο θέλετε.  Εννοείτε πως θα προτιμούσα να μπορούσε να παιχθεί και σαν campaign αλλά ΟΚ θα αρκεστούμε σε single sessions. :p

Οι κανόνες είναι πάρα πολλοί απλοί και μαθαίνεις το παιχνίδι γρήγορα ενώ έχει και μια casual friendly ατμόσφαιρα. Στην σειρά του ο κάθε παίκτης πρώτα σκανάρει ένα δωμάτιο (ουσιαστικά το φανερώνει και μπαίνουν νέοι εξωγήινοι στο παιχνίδι) και μετά εκτελεί 3 actions όπως τα κλασσικά move, attack, open/close door, heal  αλλά και πιο περίεργα όπως analyze item, subdue brain. Μόλις τελειώσουν όλοι οι ήρωες, ενεργοποιούνται και όλοι οι εξωγήινοι. 

Από πλευράς εξωγήινων έχουμε αρκετή ποικιλία με τον καθένα να έχει το δικό του στυλ παιχνιδιού. Φυσικά και ο κάθε ήρωας έχει μια ξεχωριστή ιδιότητα. Στη μάχη τα πράματα είναι επίσης απλά. Ρίχνεις μερικά δεκάπλευρα ζάρια, ανάλογα με το όπλο σου,  και κάθε ζάρι με 1,2 ή 3 μετράει σαν hit. Συνήθως ο κάθε εξωγήινος πεθαίνει με ένα hit. 

Το θέμα είναι πως τα έχτρα hit μετρούν σαν overkill και τα χρησιμοποιείς για διάφορες ικανότητες. Συνήθως έχεις να επιλέξεις ανάμεσα στο προσωπικό σου Overkill ability, σε αυτό του όπλου σου και σε αυτό του εξωγήινου που πέτυχες. Εδώ είναι και το ζουμί του παιχνιδιού και σου βγάζει και μια push your luck αίσθηση καθώς πολλές φορές αγνοούσαμε τον άμεσο κίνδυνο και χτυπούσαμε κάποιον πιο πίσω για να χρησιμοποιήσουμε το Overkill του. Ακούγεται απλό αλλά δίνει πολύ περισσότερες επιλογές από ότι θα περίμενε κανείς. :)

Στα αρνητικά να βάλω το χρονοβόρο setup με τα πολλά tokens που πρέπει να ξεχωριστούν και να ανακατευθούν. Δοκίμασα τα 3 πρώτα σενάρια τα οποία εισάγουν σταδιακά τους κανόνες του παιχνιδιού και πρέπει να ομολογήσω πως έχουν κάνει πολύ καλή δουλειά και τα σενάρια έχουν διαφορετική αίσθηση. Έχουν και μπόλικο story για να σε βάλουν στο κλίμα. :meeple: Ανάλογα με τα objectives διαλέγεις και τον αρχικό σου εξοπλισμό, ενώ βρίσκεις πληθώρα αντικειμένων στο διάβα σου κατά την διάρκεια της αποστολής. :arrrh:

Μπράβο τους που με ένα τόσο απλό ruleset κατάφεραν να φτιάξουν ένα ενδιαφέρον παιχνίδι με μπόλικες επιλογές και διαφορετική αίσθηση στους εχθρούς. :meeple: Μου άφησε καλύτερες εντυπώσεις από τα υπόλοιπα εισαγωγικά συνεργατικά dungeon crawlers όπως πχ το Mice & Mystics ή το Castle Ravenloft.

An interesting dungeon crawler with a really wide variety of missions included in the game. All iniatures and the art are really nice. 

The game involves a lot of dice rolling and a few elements may sometimes seem crippled or flawed, but overall, I don' regret buying it. It may be a little tricky to play a high number of characters alone because of the place it takes on the table.

The setup time is a little problematic.

Components are well done, with high details on the miniatures.  Cardboard tiles are clean with no immediate warping.  I forgot it had so many chits/tokens but everything fits back into the box.  Only downside is the KS promo book doesn't fit in the box.  If it did, this would a big win all around.  

Looking forward to playing it soon.

I recently got a chance to try this.  It's going to be amazing.  It takes the best ideas of the Dungeons and Dragons Adventure System games and then adds a boatload of awesome to it.  The overkill system gives you so many tactical choices that it can almost be overwhelming.  The best part is that it feels like a classic pulpy sci-fi adventure.  Each player character plays differently and the whole package is just really well done.  This is going to be a home run.

Now includes promo pack cards.

On a rare occasion, you find a game with an unusual and interesting subject, a rock solid carefully phrased rule book, beautiful and functional components, careful playtesting, a lot of replayability, elegant mechanics, fast moving play, and lots of fun decisions.  This is one of those rare games.

Designed as a co-op adventure game, it works quite nicely as a solitaire adventure/tactics game and will share top billing with Arkham Horror for that role on my table.  The combination of scenario rules, randomization of tiles and tile facing, hatch locations, alien menaces, tech discovery items, dice rolls and varying character powers and gear means you will always be facing novel situations and tough choices.

Note: This game uses dice and other forms of randomness, which is great for generating variety but which means I will have a harder time winning it than most people.  (I have to cheat when playing Arkham Horror solitaire due to consistently atrocious dice rolls that tend to break whatever game system I am playing.)

Have played so far:
Scenario 1 (training scenario) once - victory
Scenario 2 (Venus) five times (four losses, then a win using pro-Rocketeer house rules)
Scenario 3 (Earth/Orbital Platform) three times - all victories
Scenario 4 (Moon/Boarding Action) - four times (two losses, then a win using pro-Rocketeer house rules, then a straight win)
Scenario 5 (Mars/Space Station Attack) - twice - both victories
Scenario 6 (Asteroid Belt/Infestation) - once - victory
Scenario 7 (Ganymede/Night of the Beast) - twice - both losses
Scenario 8 (Jupiter/Tyranno) - twice - one loss, one victory
Scenario 9 (Saturn/Sleeper Ship) - once - victory
Scenario 10 (Uranus/Bug Hunt) - once - loss

Playtested several times and helped with the rules editing. I really like this game.

The concepts here are similar to Galaxy Defenders, but this game plays much faster due to the more streamlined dice mechanics. What it lacks in plastic, it makes up for in fun!

UPDATE: It no longer lacks plastic. Kickstarter FTW!

UPDATE UPDATE: Received and played the published game. They really knocked it out of the park with the components. The only thing I would've done differently is mold the Thrall figures in a different color, since they resemble the two-gun Saucermen. (Maybe grey, like the player figures, since they're also human.)

A very enjoyable space-crawl, co-op puzzler set in the golden age of pulp sci-fi. Well produced and a fun game to play with scope for much decision making, daring do, narrow escapes and agonising defeats. The overkill mechanic is the one that lifts the game above the pack, multiplying the options faced by the player without an overly complex rule set.

Setting up the missions can be a little fiddly as it requires finding specific tokens but it's manageable with a storage system other than bags.

Plays especially well solo (playing 3 characters).

To be honest I backed this game largely because of an online community and it's relationship to the designer. Were it not for that I don't know if I would have backed. That said I am very happy I did. The rules are straight forward while still having some innovative elements. There's a nice balance between luck and decisions. Everything is very retro from the mechanics to the art direction to the design. Sadly I don't think that's going to be enough to get it noticed. Setup and a chore. And I'm mixed on the hex tiles, game-wise it makes things much more interesting that right angles but visually it doesn't feel like a space ship or really anything for that matter. I hope to see more content in the future but I'm not holding my breath.

This game is amazing!

It only has one downside, but that is pretty substantial: It takes really long to set up, especially considering the play time. Each scenario comes with little rules tweaks and different sets of tiles and tokens you have to search for and then randomize. So it's one of those games where it's highly preferrable if you set it up in advance.

My rating would be even higher if it weren't so darn fiddly, because the gameplay itself is pretty smooth and straight forward.

Bland, generic theme backed by bland, generic gameplay wrapped up in a package of bland, generic character design and bland, generic components.

I really love this game a lot, although it kicks my butt pretty well. What I really like about it is the 1950s Science Fiction theme and all the interesting choices you can make each turn. I like all the different scenarios that are presented for this game in a way that builds shapes with flipped unknown tiles. These shapes can be all kinds of things from Flying Saucers, to Space Stations and Rockets. What I don't like is having to sort all the chits per Scenario which becomes a bit fiddly setting it up. But once you have the Scenario set up, you can play it several times with a lot of the same chits so the setup gets easier on a replay.

What I didn't like about it much was the way the space creatures piled up on you toward the end of some scenarios (which caused me to lower my ranking to 8). If you played it good you probably wouldn't get overrun like a zombie attack, but I'll need to play more of this to see. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game is fantastic. 

It packs all of the things I enjoy about dungeon crawling (gradual, steady discovery, loot, multiple abilities, growing enemy threat) into a golden era sci fi setting which I equally enjoy.  The "overkill" mechanic, where more than one success gives you a selection of additional procs on either your character, your weapon, or the target alien, is genius.  It paces the game nicely since you can't one-shot an alien and vice-versa (a common problem in games like Descent) but a good die roll can instead infuse more choices into your turn, or more drama into the alien's turn.

Another huge plus is the generous amount of scenarios. I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of the core scenarios, much less the bonuses in the Kickstarter book.

My only minor complaints are cosmetic. The tile art is a bit drab and gray. I understand that these are mostly UFO ships we're exploring but some color or lighting effects would have really made a difference. Also, the thralls have the same shade of green plastic as some of the other aliens, making it a little difficult to tell them apart initially (I think I'll paint mine). But these are extremely minor flaws in an obviously inspired design.

I'm certain this will remain a classic in my collection for quite awhile.

Yeah, believe the hype. It's a shockingly worthy entrant in the (thankfully) crowded field. The theme does nothing for me, though admittedly it's well-executed; it's the gameplay that works.

As advertised, setup is a bit of a chore, but it's not unreasonable (and teardown is at least easier).

Fun and highly thematic co-op game straight from the golden age of science fiction.   I've been playing solo and 2p, both are great. My only complaint is the rulebook layout could have been better. There's a lot of page turning involved to find special rules and an index or page notation in the scenario book would alleviate this. I won't complain about the setup time since all of those different counters make the game what it is. I recommend this game to any science fiction fan or fan of tense character-driven ameritrash.

Played twice so far and I had a fun time. The biggest problem isn't with the game, per se, but with the cooperative nature of it. Essentially, it turns into a team game where everyone decides what each character should do. Or, worse, it turns into one person dominating the conversation and trying to tell everyone else what their character should do. I understand that's more of an issue with the people playing than it is with the game.

I'm very happy I sprung for the painted miniatures, as they really look great!

Surprisingly violent game, with a dice mechanic that manages to turn every good roll into an interesting little optimization puzzle.  I'll also give it credit for having a good variety of non-combat actions (subduing thralls and brains, analyzing components, interacting with the ship, etc.), which provide a more colorful narrative than its more straightforward dungeon crawler competition.  Ended up being very happy with this game and expect to be playing a lot more of it in the near future.

Huge production value. The rules and scenarios books are a pleasure to read (as big as the box, clearly explained with several pages of play examples), nice miniatures, a very welcome player aid. Many special tiles/tokens the game is also a sandbox to make random and custom scenarios.
Great mechanics, streamlined but many choices. I enjoy very much Claustrophobia but always regret it is not multiplayer or solo. Space Cadets Away Missions feels to me like the big brother of Claustrophobia: a dungeon crawl with streamlined mechanics but less random, more characters/enemies/items/choices/depth, and 1-6 players. Easy to grasp hard to master, much more strategic than meets the eye.

This has been getting a lot of good buzz lately but for some reason I thought it was some kind of miniatures game and that’s not normally my thing. It’s not. It’s more like a dungeon crawl game and it is a bunch of fun. We played a scenario where aliens were infesting our spacecraft and we had to defeat them all before the self-destruct went off. We were successful, but largely because of an amazing turn where the meathead character found some kind of adrenaline injector, Hulked out, and went on a rampage, mowing down aliens left and right. It was glorious. The copy I played was the top-of-the-line Kickstarter edition with beautifully painted miniatures. I don’t usually care about such things, but in this case they really made the game come alive. It was loads of fun.

There's a lot more going on with this gem of a game than a cursory glance reveals. It's deceptively simple, impressively streamlined, and resplendent with a gosh-wow-sense-of-wonder aesthetic that makes it a joy to play. 

The narrative that unfolds as you play through the twenty or more scenarios is well-crafted and deeply immersive--pulp literature at its best.

Though setting up an adventure takes a little longer than I like, the ensuing entertainment is well worth the effort. 

Long live the Rocket Patrol!

After receiving this, I was surprised by how much fun I thought it would be with a group, but sadly it fell very flat for a group of 6. I'm definitely partially to blame since I didn't have good answers to some of the rules questions/ambiguities. My plan is to try it out with my son and see if it's a keeper.

Tried to play a solo mission, but the setup wore me out, so I packed it up after a few turns.

RATING: N/A
The components in this game are top notch, and it's an excellent example of a thematic/Amerithrash game. But this game suffered from the same problem we had with Galaxy Defenders. It felt like move, roll dice, move, roll dice. A lot of repetition and luck. Not for us.

RATING: 9.5
I am impressed with the simplicity of the rules and the amount that is achieved with them. This system allows for varied gameplay styles, multiple different aliens, special abilities, weapons, and equipment, but doesn't get bogged down in detail, or rules look-ups.

As a multiplayer it is easy to teach and play and the group has to work together properly to win. As a solo game it's easy to handle, I could probably manage up to four characters max.

Basically what I hoped Galaxy Defenders would be.

Edit: 5 scenarios in, still loving this system. One of my most played games of 2015.

Edit 2: Scenario 6 is very difficult and pretty random, but scenario 7 was a blast. I LOVE THIS GAME.

A nice tongue-in-cheek nod to the golden age of sci-fi movies with a sprinkling of Star Trek thrown in for good measure. It's a pretty standard dungeon crawler with the important distinction that the monsters are generally tougher than you, which makes for a very different experience.

Edit: just received a couple of days ago, and have played the first two scenarios. Like pretty much all co-op games in this phylum that I have played, I suppose it could be dominated by one alpha gamer, if the rest of the players allowed it. Very much a dungeon crawl, but with some varied situations and victory conditions. The interesting part of the game generally is what to do with your overkill actions, as you will usually get quite a few. I will mostly play it solo, and it seems to work well for that. I think two player would also be quite good, not certain about 4+ player. The plastic minis are nice (especially Brain in the Jar), and they probably even add something to the theme, but Minis don't do much for me, and I would have been just as happy playing with chits. Components all around are very nice. (There is a price, though...it's not an inexpensive game)

Setup is kind of a pain, especially solitaire, par for the course for games likes this. Works well solitaire, unlike some other coop games, you can play two or three characters easily without it feeling like too much work. Part of that is due to the clean, mostly non fiddly design. 

---------------------- 

Games with lots of plastic figures aren't really my thing at all, but from viewing Dan's really excellent walkthough, this looks like a game I'd like. It seems to have a (considerably) lighter Magic Realm vibe, set on a space station. And it seems very straightforward to play, despite some cool chrome. 100 bucks is steep, but I'm tempted...

Pretty meh, for the most part. Kind of reminded me of the D&D board games (Ravenloft, Ashardelon, etc.), but in space. The minis are all really cool, and the cheesy, B-movie Scifi theme comes through really well. Unfortunately the game is essentially just a fast-paced dice fest. I suppose if you've never played a game like Descent or Imperial Assault, this would be a great game to start out with. If you've already played those aforementioned games, however, you're not going to see much of anything new here, except for the fact that this is fully co-op. Not to mention some of the rules are counter-intuitive, and are at odds with the norm for this style of game, such as rolling lower being better. This was a bit of a disappointment, as I really liked everything about the game except for the execution itself. Just kind of felt like yet another game of moving and rolling dice to shoot with an objective in mind.

Needs more plays to be fully assessed, but initial impressions are very poor. Its a half-decent attempt at a "rush" Dungeon Crawler a-la Descent, but oversimplification of the tiles, LOS and movement elements kill pretty much all elements of positioning tactics that are usually the core of these types of games.


That plus the completely generic and identical grey tiles makes one wonder why was this ever conceived as a miniature games/dungeon crawler at all. (besides the obvious "kickstart a bunch of plastic" gimmick)

The rest of the mechanics are simply not that impressive nor engaging. (overkill? meh).
Its fast and easily disposed of in a game night. I´ll give it that. And the minis are cool.

Lots to like with the system - and tremendous flavor and theme added by the well-written rules and scenario books - but it's a shame that it's all a bit undone by the uninspired and mediocre graphic design - something that's sadly an issue with most all Stronghold-developed titles.   It's disappointing because everything else with the game is so excellent - and the golden age of sci-fi setting has such a rich visual history...but you wouldn't know it from the blase tiles, counters, cards, and character sheets.  A missed opportunity for an otherwise excellent game.

RATING: 10
Criminally underrated game that I can only assume didn't get that much attention due to its aesthetic and being part of an overloaded franchise.

Scales perfectly for all player counts, every game is tense but winnable, and it is the only 10/10 game that I ever played in 35 years of gaming. Grognards, gaming newbies, and wife are all fans. Been playing this for a couple of years now and it just keeps getting better.

Yes there's buckets-o-dice but it's at that level where the luck will balance out. So it is all about the team work, the planning, maximising your unique skills, and then wringing out everything you pick up for every last drop right from the word 'go'.

Bravo to the designers, and I hope you release something similar but with a more tedious theme (Zombies? Vikings?). Not that I want to buy it because this game is perfect for me and my group, but I'd like to see you get the financial recognition that you deserve for this fabulous system.

This is quite a fun co-op/solitaire. Great miniatures (the painted versions are knockout) and quite a varied range of scenarios. The fact that aliens don't have any actions until all the rocketeers have had theirs (and rocketeers can also get various extra and free actions) means it is quite easy on the scenarios I've played so far. Still that probably makes it a reasonable gateway game.

This is such a well thought out game that it's a joy to play. The rules are intuitive and after playing the first scenario they will feel familiar. What's great is the strategic options you get to make due to the variety of aliens/equipment and they're strengths and weaknesses. I found my self in a desperate situation with too many saucermen coming after me and a sentinel monster looming in the distance. The sentinel would have finished me off had it not been for a quick retreat behind some hatches which stood in its way, I was able to dispatch the saucer men and then spend time healing before confronting the beast. It reminds me of Dan Dare and all those 50's icons Flash Gordon/Buck Rodgers.  You are given plenty of scenarios and more will come with expansions no doubt but you can also create your own and i'm hoping they will release planet tiles and take the missions to alien planets. Quite a lot is possible with this game even campaign play. It's great solo but even better with more players. Truly a fantastic co-operative game that will have you talking about it afterwards and glowing in your tactical decisions. Lots of scenarios means you will be playing this for ages. For me the most exciting buy I've had for years.

I managed to play a few solo games.

The first mission was very easy, but I did enjoy it.

I played the second mission 3 times (with different cadets) and was unable to beat it.  I enjoyed it, but the game seems way more random than tactical, which is a little bit of a bummer for me.  I got frustrated with the game after failing mission 2 three times and have not picked it up since.

I started playing again and finally beat the 2nd and 3rd missions.  I'm still undecided about the mechanics, but this game has really grown on me as a solo play game.  I'm willing to try it out with a group of friends, but not willing to teach it, so we'll see where that goes.

Never give up, never surrender!! Most dungeon crawlers have a really dark theme, so I'm really glad that Space Cadets Away Missions came along. The retro space theme makes for a really fun setting. The missions are still tough enough and will play out differently every time due to the variabel board setup. The overkill option is just great; makes killing a large monster more challenging and gives you more options throughout. Great game, love it!

Super fun co-op.  It captures the great flavor of 50s sci-fi thrown in with all the best tropes from Star Trek TOS.  It plays somewhere between the D&D Ravenloft games and Spacehulk without any of the repetitive or cumbersome qualities of either.  Lots of superpowers, loads of weapons and equipment that yield fun unique effects.  Yes, it is a bit of a hash out dungeon crawl in space, but even at its base level it's great to figure out how to beat back the swarms of various alien baddies.

This felt as though there were a lot of rules for what is essentially a very simple run around and shoot stuff kind of game. It felt like complexity, not depth.

Pretty miniatures, nice retro 50's theme, but lacking in gameplay.

A "dungeon" crawler with a novel theme reminiscent of cheesy UFO sci-fi like Plan 9 From Outer Space.  I like that the alien bad guys are automated instead of player-controlled, I like the alien sculpts in their unique poses, and I LOVE the glittery d10s.  And the overkill mechanic for extra successes is pretty slick, and much more interesting than cumulative successes or "exploding sixes."

The first scenario is pretty basic and easy but I'm looking forward to playing through the entire campaign, either solo or with others.

First Impression:

A highly thematic retro sci-fi adventure game.

The game is oozing with theme, and really sucks you in it. The rules are simple, yet the in game decisions are very rich. The simple overkill mechanism is one of the simplest and most brilliant push your luck mechanisms I've ever seen. It works fantastically. The game calls for both a good knowledge of individual characters and cooperation to stand a chance to beat it. The result is that the classic alpha player will find himself fairly overwhelmed in this game despite the simple rules - a good thing. The in-game discoveries are amazingly balanced and manage to create in a very simple way all three: amazing variaty from game to game for the same mission, call for a change of tactics to make the best use of them and feel really really cool when used without being gamebreaking. Even the tile setup calls for different strategies depending on the hatches layout and really makes an impact making every game different and every tile exploration impressively interesting. The enemies of this game are also some of the best I've seen in an adventure game. They are so completely different from each other, that it is amazing how different the tactics they call for are - really brilliant. The difficulty level of the game (I've just played on easy mind you) really seems right on spot, with the game feeling really tough and calling for your full participation and cooperation, yet still feeling beatable even as it slaps you on your face.

So, anything wrong with this one? As with all adventure games it will rise or fall depending on how it stands the test of time in terms of replayability. From what I've seen so far I'm impressed, but of course I can't commend on replayability and true mission variaty with so few plays. I'm also not sure how this thing will scale. In theory it should scale very well, but maybe downtime will be an issue with max players.

Keep in mind that the first mission is an indroductory one. It's basically there to teach new players how to play the game. The second mission really lets the system shine, and it's were the player skills are put to full test. After the first mission I was "well, it's an ok game". After the second I was stunned.

Overall it was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to play more.

This one totally caught me off guard. I just "assumed" it was another derivative of their big group real-time dice chuckers. Lo and behold, it is a cadet dudes on a modular hex sci-fi dungeon crawl. Tons of plastic, action point system, and scenarios. Introduces overkill using extra combat successes to trigger other actions besides more damage. This is sure to make its way into other game systems. I also dig how the scanning system scales with more players to reveal more terrain (and by terrain I mean aliens!)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A game that will appeal to fans of Doom and Descent (1st edition), and other people who think that dying is a fun hobby.  Luckily, I fall into that category.

I love the overkill mechanic, where each successful die roll beyond the first results in a special (and fun) power activation.  E.g., three successes = one hit + two power activations, which might be weapon powers, character powers, and/or "damaged alien" powers.

Bonus: The sheer number of scenarios (twenty) is extremely impressive. And god help me, I've discovered that I have an inappropriate fondness for sparkle dice.

Warning: I wouldn't call [i]Away Missions[/i] family friendly, in the sense that most kids and young adults will get creamed if left to play on their own.  It takes a group of dedicated adults willing to explore/game the system in order to win the more difficult scenarios, which - from what I hear - is almost all of them.

Still a really fun game, but we're tired of being brutally beaten down by each scenario.  We've started giving each player one additional oxygen to make SC:AM more entertaining and winnable.

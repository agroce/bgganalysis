GAME: Battle Cry: 150th Civil War Anniversary Edition
RANK: 893
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great entry point into simulation war-gaming.  The Commands & Colors system is the easiest wargaming rule set I know of, and Battle Cry is the easiest implementation.  

This particular version of the game is attractive, tactile (great little minis), richly historic and very repayable (comes with 30 scenarios).  If Risk is getting boring, you owe it to yourself to grab this game.

RATING: 6.5
The packaging is high quality as is the color rulebook. Beig able to customize the board makes for a lot of re play value. I love the card element of the game mechanics. They can make or break the game sometimes but they're fun none the less.

There are a good amount of soldiers and other pieces, and they are all well made.

It's an easy game to pick upbut there is more stratagy to it than first meets the eye. With all the variants freely available you can make this game as complicated as you want.

My son and I have played through all the scenarios that come with the rulebook and they give more of a feel for the specific battle than actual simulation.


All in all a great game that's kept our attention long enough that we've built a ACW campaign around the game.

It's a Richard Borg game, so if you played one, you know how to play this.

I get annoyed at how he takes a mechanic and puts it into various boxes and repackages it.  Yet this game is like crack.  It is easy to set up, plays quickly, and is a blast.

This is the best looking of the Borg games: good looking plastic and great looking cards.

It's not as deep in strategy as Command & Colors: Ancients.  Also, the cavalry in this game does not even closely resemble how cavalry was utilized in that war.  Despite all of that, I find myself playing this one more than his other games.  

The 150th edition has a huge book of scenarios, so if you have a choice, get this one.

This was my first Civil War game and got me interested in learning more about it, so it has a special place with me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Improves on original, somewhat better card balance.  Not as deep as C&C:A, and more luckish than M44 (yeah, I know!) but quicker, perhaps, shorter setup, and gives more feel for the "key terrain" concept, gives the and "capture that hill, boys!" of battle.

A bit redundant if you own M44 and C&C:A, and aren't really really excited about playing the Civil War with ok but not exciting components.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
How far can this system go in terms of simplicity. Its a good gate way game for my 6 year old son.

Good quality board and terrain tiles. Plastic standup figures are great in detail but is still soft and bends easily. The cards are on the thin side but they are glossed.

The biggest problems I have is keeping the flags on the banner stand in proper. They tend to slide down after a few plays.

Will play this game with my son or with newbies to wargames.

This is my first introduction to the Commands & Colors system. We had a tight game through the 1st scenario. Sander had the 6 required flags to my 4. Card draw is obviously very powerful. However, correct placement of your units is crucial as well. Components of this edition are amazing. Looking forward towards many more plays.

Might be my favourite Commands & Colours game. The rules for terrain, etc. are not too complicated, and doesn't have a dozen different unit types. There's a nice balance between the mobile cavalry (who can only attack adjacent) and the slower infantry (who can attack far away).

Another great Richard Borg game in the Commands & Colors/Memoir 44 design.  This is an excellent family game with a Civil War theme and a perfect intro to the lighter wargames.

Easy to learn play, but great fun.  Really feels like a battle.  It only takes a few moments to learn the game.

Some people won't like the randomness of the dice and cards, buy hey, war is random! 

The individual Civil War battles are really innovative in the way that they are set up, I was very surprised.  It is a must have for any one with an interest in the Civil War.  It's a good feeling when you can beat Fredericksburg with the Union
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
We play with a rather major variant to give the game a more realistic civil war combat feel.  Would receive a slightly lower score if confined to the base rules, but there is something positive to be said about a game that is able to be modified to fit user preferences.

Bought this for $60 at Tramp's Comics and Games in Regina, likely in 2012.  I have played it once with Don Rice, scenarios 1 and 2 (1 win each), and once with Darryl Thiessen, scenarios 1 through 5 (5 wins for me).  Darryl T. got so frustrated with the dice rolling that I won't ask him to play again.  He wants to try the game with regular dice next time - he expects the outcome will be different for some reason.
I think it's a great game!  I know nothing about the US Civil War, and I don't know how accurate the material is, but I found it interesting.
I also love the fact that there aren't additional scenarios that I feel obligated to buy!  So it's a complete game.  I suppose there are additional scenarios online, and that would be great as well.
My one beef with the game is that the flag stickers never had sufficient stickiness to them.  I will have to glue them together the next time I bring the game out to play.
I love all of the Command and Colours games I have played so far - BattleLore, Memoir '44, and now Battle Cry.  I don't own Memoir '44, but Darryl T. does.

This game is so easy to set up and play, simple C&C rules and you can easily play a couple of games in one session.
I like the minis, and there are a number of rule tweaks (dismounted cavalry,  green troops etc) and add on campaigns and cards etc that Battle Cry community have produced to keep you going for ages without repeating a battle. Some kind souls have even produced scenarios and rules for Anglo- Zulu conflict for this game which includes a complete scenario for Rorkes Drift.
Very very enjoyable to play

It’s card driven – similar to Battle Masters or Assault on Hoth except by section of the battlefield instead of by troop. We’re not super into the Civil War but thought we would try the system as it is the basis for the Memoir ’44 system. It seems fun enough and we look forward to playing through more of the scenarios. Plus the figures are pretty detailed.

Fast and furious chaotic wargame-lite. Hoards of American Civil War miniatures are driven across a large-hex map via a simple card play system. Play a card, follow the simple instructions, move a few pieces, roll some dice. You can play three or four battles in a two hour session. You can get your hat handed to you through poor cards and/or hot dice, but the basic systems are so easy and accessible you just want to play it.  Great stuff.

It is a very good command and colors game, and an easy one as well. The board and terrain pieces have great art and design on them (far better than napoleon). The miniatures are decent (except for the stickers for the flags, they do not fit them well. All in all a good fun game that is not too difficult and does not take too long. Compared to other command and colors: better than the great war, better than memoir 44 (I personally do not think the WW2 element works well in this type of game).

I gotta have this game. I know it might not be as good as Memoir '44 (my understanding is that it is the same designer and same game mechanics). However I am really interested in Civil War history, I love Memoir '44, and even if I wind up not playing this game very much I don't care I just want it :)
It would be great to get a copy of the original edition.

The long but decreasing ranges of the infantry and artillery give a different feel to the game from the other implementations.

What can I say.  I love this game and it's got me into a lot of other very fun games.  The card driven mechanism is a lot of fun.

Of all the C&C systems, this is my favorite. Why?  You might ask.  Well, that is because this isn't a deep system.  It's very simple and somewhat random.  I think the following versions just start to take away from the simplicity, which is it's core.

2011 Secret Santa gift. Compared to Memoir '44, I think Memoir is a better 'put together' game.  The cards in Battle Cry aren't very intuitive and the text is extremely small.

Everything good about original Battle Cry is still here, and I will rate this edition higher. If for nothing else, then just because for the effort and dedication of the author and his team to this great, light quick wargame with historic Civil War flavour. I think game goes great with casual gamers, it can be seen as chess with cards and dice. There are few rule and card changes, and I think they make the game better. Generals have more subtle role now. In defense, units with generals may ignore one retreat move, in offense, they cant battle with +1 die anymore, but may take ground (nice edition from BCs follow up Memoir44). Also, units now usually may battle same turn they enter woods and buildings, but with limited range and power. Its harder to eliminate a unit with retreat, too. I like new colorful artwork, comic book style leaning to realistic. There are 30 battle scenarios, most from 1861 and 1862. In chronological order, first battle now is Falling Waters, then you go to First Bull Run...

A nice update to the original with many more battles (30 versus the original's 15), an improved card deck that borrows some ideas back from C&C:Napoleonics and improved staying power for artillery (each artillery unit now has three figures instead of just two).

If you've played Command & Colors Ancients : Very similar, but much simpler. Also, all units except for cavalry have ranged weapons.

If you haven't played C&C:A or any other similar system : A very fun game that captures the limitations of commanding troops on the battlefield. Cards in your hand will determine what you can control on the left, center or right battle front. Plan carefully, since a brash attack on one front without any followup cards in hand for later turns might leave you open and unable to follow through and could leave you open for a repeated pounding.

I bought this game for my buddy and today we were able to play the first scenario. The game concepts were already familiar to me from playing C&C:A but everything was new to him. On the off chance we happened to play on the very anniversary of the Battle of Bull Run. We didn't realize this until after the game was over though so that was a nice touch.

The components are OK, although cheaply produced but great for the street price. I actually find I prefer the blocks of C&C:A for the repeated handling, although the minis are naturally more thematic and would look great painted. The insert nicely stores everything too. While there is a flimsy terrain aid sheet, there should be one for the other basic rules too (troop movement, battle range, etc.). Easy to make, but something that could have been included since those are some of the things a beginner stumbles over.

After trying Commands & Colors: Ancients and deciding it wasn't to my taste, I thought I'd give this a whirl. Civil War, check, easy to play, check, tons of scenarios, check, new version with updated rules and components, check. Fun factor -- fail. My lack of enthusiasm for the C&C system flowed into this game as well. This might be good for C&C enthusiasts, but it didn't work for me. I know there are plenty of grognards who enjoy these games, and I'm glad they like this game. For me, I'll stick to the meatier efforts for my ACW fix.

Uses the same great game system that is used in Memoir 44 and the Great War. The twist is that leaders (having a general with one of your units) gives it a slight, but important edge.


Battle Cry also sets up the battles similar to how they historically were.  That is, the types and ratios of units and the terrain and deployment are the same as in the 1860s.  This gives you and easy way to appreciate the perspective of the battles.  I visited Gettysburg again just recently and found the game gave me a new understanding of what happened there.

02/05/12 Played one game. 
Differences in the new edition, and what I thought of them: 
-  The board is now sort of greenish yellow (grass/sand), whereas the old one was sand colored. Insignificant by itself, except when you add terrain tiles that are mostly the same color it all sort of blends together. I prefer the old look as it was easier to spot important terrain. 
- The terrain tile artwork looked very similar to the old edition. The main difference was the hills, which I thought they did a poor job on. No longer could you clearly see the slopes of the hill. So it was hard to tell it was a hill at all. 
- All terrain tile types were the same except they'd added "homestead" tiles. They looked and acted like weak towns. I thought that was an excellent addition.  
- I thought  the new sculpts for the generals and artillery looked OK. I did object to the new infantry sculpt that had the soldier pointing his bayonet equipped musket straight out, instead of up at a 45 degree angle like the old figurines. This new gun angle made setting up and maneuvering a company of infantry more difficult, as the two dudes in the back stuck their bayonets into the backs of their two comrades in front. The new cavalry sculpt was serviceable, its pose just didn't look as nice/natural as the old one. 
- Speaking of figurines, a change to the game allows the artillery units absorb three hits instead of two before they die. So instead of the two cannons of the 2000 edition now there is one cannon, a loader figurine, and an officer figurine. I'm neutral on this rule change. The new figurines looked nice, though I thought the cannon now took up too much space.
- The rule book looked well done when I flipped through it. I was slightly irritated that all the new scenarios were from 1861 and 1862. Though there are many more of them overall than in the previous edition. I *assume* some expansion will be forthcoming with the 1863-1865 scenarios. But that's merely conjecture. 
- The cards were improved in artwork (now in color) and type. Lessons were learned from Memoir '44. For now Battle Cry cards had many changes that stemmed from that other Richard Borg game. I won't go into all of them, as there are over a dozen differences. Suffice to say I approve of them all. One bad thing, the text size is too small. This was unnecessary, as there is plenty of room on the cards. 
- One thing I found extremely weird, the publisher's name/logo doesn't appear on the box top or any of the four sides. I've seen over 600 board game boxes and I've never seen that. It was as if the publisher was ashamed of their name. Only if you look at the bottom of the box do you see (in small print) Avalon Hill/Wizards of the Coast/Hasbro logos. Also, the artwork on the box top was serviceable, but slightly amateurish. The old box graphics/art was much superior. 
- I can't speak to all the rule changes, for I only saw a fraction of them in the one scenario I played (new #1). But from what the owner told me of others they all seemed like good ideas. I did lament they still didn't number the scenarios. A lesson they failed to learn from Memoir '44. 

Overall I'd say this 2011 edition is a winner. If I didn't own the 2000 version I'd certainly buy it. I rated it a "9" (just like I rated the old one). 

02/23/13 Played (new) scenario #4, twice. I also inspected the rulebook more closely and noticed they'd added entrenchment terrain. Though none seem to be used in the scenarios provided. I assume they are for future late war scenarios like Petersburg (that will probably never materialize since Hasbro has since declined to follow up with any expansions for this fine game).

Starting on 04/05/14 I began playing the new scenarios from this game with my old (2000) edition of Battle Cry. I call it Battle Cry version 1.5 in that I'm using the new rules, figurine mix (3 figs for arty, etc), terrain effects, and new terrain (homesteads, entrenchments, etc. - which I made myself). As to the cards I use the ones from my 2000 set, but I've put am orange star on the top of some and give players a list of changes (e.g. if you don't have an artillery unit, or cavalry, or general, activate a unit of your choice, or if you play a Skirmish look at two cards and keep one, etc.). 

As of 06/11/16 I've now played the 13 new scenarios twice each, and one of the revised old scenarios twice each.

The presentation is nice but not mind-blowing, the minis are pretty good, the insert is well-designed, the terrain and map are highlights. Game play is solid, streamlined and simple, like all of the games based on this system.

It's not a theme of particular interest, but it is fast enough and fun enough that I would play it if asked. Memoir and Battlelore scratch my itch better for this type of game and would be greatly preferred, however.

initial thoughts are that I wish Days of Wonder would have bought this out as the sculps would have been better.Could have been same size box as Mem`44. All a bit nit picky, but can`t help feeling it is a big box of Air, and also, throw away the awful plastic tray.As for the game itself..can`t compare to the original caus never got to own it or play it..but after playing not as as good as Mem`44

Update: after a few plays, my disappointment in this game is overwhelming and my rating of it has changed. Way way way toooooooooooooooooooooooo slow and ponderous. Way too many gaping holes in the system you could drive a fleet of buses through makes the whole package interminable. When our group got as far as second Bull Run, we`d all lost the will to live I reckon.

A huge flop after the fun of Mem`44.

Even though this is the oldest C&C game, I think it may be my favorite. Everything is in the box, so no hunting down expansions. You get a ton of content, and while there are only 4 types of units, it doesn't feel derivative at all. The component quality could be better though. I gave up on trying to stick the flags on the units and just glued them on.

Fantastic game, great quality, I love this edition, the miniature pose are more dramatic, the cards too me just look nicer in there layout and presentation.

The board lets you join others to it for larger battles where the other had the generals along its edge.

Rule book with extra battles is a big plus, Jacksons campaign and the anniversary edition battles. If you dont own this game I would recommend looking at this version.

I understand peoples views about the flags but a dap of strong glue and fixed!

A nice one.
With simple rules and a card-driven/luck depended attitude, Battle Cry is a light, fast-paced, wargame with some character.
Although at the cost of tactical depth, Battle Cry is really "easy-going"; it leaves you wanting another battle.
It also comes with pretty components and artwork , a well written rulebook and a ton of scenarios.

I would definitely give it a try if I were you.

RATING: 8
Lots of fun battling armies (I'll stop short of calling it a wargame) without too many rules to get you bogged down. Battles only take an hour which is great for kids. The system has a very satisfying strategy-to-rules-to-palying time ratio.

On the down side, playing normally aggressive tactics results in many of the scenarios ending just as the battle is getting fully engaged. I often find myself wanting to keep playing beyond the 6 battle flag point. I realize this is just due to players not being cautious enough. But if that is the case, then the problem may be in the balance between the starting positions and the range of the attacks. If you moved all the units a little bit closer and reduced the attacking range, it might all come together perfectly for the less patient gamer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable light Civil War game, probably best as a gateway or introductory game for kids and those new to historical wargames.  Plastic soldiers are cool, activation of units by playing cards works well and adds additional interest and luck, 20 game scenarios make it replayable at least through all the scenarios.  For those not familiar with wargaming when you play this first you should remove the more complicated cards.

I was really looking forward to this new version of the game.  For the most part I like the new version.  I always liked the original.  There are a few items that could have made the game better.  The flags will not stay on my miniatures. Also, I was hoping that you could combine two games to make large battles line in Memoir '44.  The hexes do not go the whole way to the edges, so if you combine two boards there will be a big black streak down the middle.  Also, on one side of the board the hexes would not match up.  It would be great to get 6 or 8 players together, for a large battle, but so far it appears my hopes have been dashed,  Maybe they will come out with a large map and extra miniatures and cards in an expansion to play large battles.

Commands and Colors (CC) system. 
A very refined game that generates tense moments without dragging for too long. 

I prefer it to Memoir-44. It seems to me the CC system can be a more realistic simulation of battles with short-range confrontations, such as a US Civil War setting, or battles of Antiquity. Also, if you do not share any interest in the period (US civil war of 1861-65) then this game will not appeal to you.

Seems the slight rule changes between Battle Cry and Battle Cry 150 Yr Ed have made a big difference in game play.  Can't wait for the expansions!  Big box with lots of room, I hope means WOTC has a way to fill it up.

After a few more play throughs, dropped the game to "6" from an 8.  for some reason Memoir '44 just seems to work better.  So, they can't be rated the same.  If I were asked to play Battle Cry I would suggest Memoir '44 over it every time.

2 plays, scenarios without cavalry

Fun game in the C&C series. I started with Memoir, then tried CC Ancients, and finally this one. I'm not a history buff so I don't have any particular connection to the theme of any of these. Game play, though, seems best with Ancients, the main down side being the increase in complexity with the wider variety of unit types. Without playing more scenarios, though, it's difficult comparing this with M'44 -- game play seems very similar.

--- Rule Differences vs. M'44 ---
- Infantry:
... move 1 and battle (may not move 2)
... fight at 4-3-2-1
... may not take ground unless accompanied by a Leader
- Artillery:
... fight at 5-4-3-2-1
... if on hilltop, 5-4-3-2-1-1
... DO need line of sight
- Cavalry:

- Leaders:
... may join any unit
... allows that unit to ignore one retreat
... if the unit attacks and empties a hex, may take ground
- New terrain types

I did not play the first edition, so I can't make comments about the changes. Easy rules belonging to Commands & Colors series but game play is quite different from C&C Ancients, which in my opinion is more realistic (within the boundaries of the system, of course). Nevertheless the game is fun and might certainly be improved by house rules, though for the moment I haven't felt the need.

Like Command and Colors, I prefer a less random method of card drawing, which we've developed. And, like C&C, it uses a very simple system to learn, with very helpful reference charts.

For now this is the only war game I need. Plays quickly and the rules are easy to learn. I played and liked Memoir '44, but I find the Civil War more interesting. Setup is obnoxious.

Nueva edición con importantes mejoras. Sigue siendo muy simple, pero por ello es fácil de explicar y de jugar hasta con los no aficionados a los wargames.

I am a Civil War reenactor, so this is a must-own for me. This game is a 2 player combat game that I enjoy but don't really look to play that often. I think it takes a bit too long to play.

Theme is good. Miniatures are good. Gameplay is straight-forward. I've heard that Memoir '44 is a better playing version of this so unless you're a Civil War buff like me then perhaps go with '44.

Very Good. Improved on a couple of things from the 1st edition. One of the best is that it now takes 3 hits to kill an artillery unit.

updated version of this classic game. They removed the All out attack card and changed some of the mini's in it

RATING: 6
I love the production quality and I enjoy the game all set up and ready to play on the table. But damn it, I still hate the card driven system. As much as C&C:A is tempting given my complete want-on for all things Roman, it is definitely now a try-before-I-buy. 

I know they're ultimately different systems, but they are similar enough in passing that I'm dissuaded from plonking down the cash.

Battle Cry is an awesome game. This edition is beautiful.

I bought this game prior to joining BoardGameGeek. At the time, the only wargames I'd been exposed too were several Risk variants and the Axis & Allies series. I did hear about this game when it was originally announced, but I didn't preorder it, because I wasn't sure I'd like it.

A few months later, I saw it in my local game store. I reconsidered getting it, and while I still wasn't sure how much I'd like it, I bought it.

It took me awhile to get around to playing it, but when I did, I found I really liked the game's mechanics.

Since joining BoardGameGeek, though my purchases have been primarily Ameritrash and Euro's, my experience with Battle Cry compelled me to look into the other [family=50][/family] games. I know I definitely want to try Samurai Battles, Battlelore, and C&C Ancients. I'll probably want to try the mechanics of Abaddon. In all likely hood, I'll probably be wanting Memior '44 and Napoleonics as well.

That's not to say I don't want to try other wargames. There are other wargame systems I'm interested in trying, particularly block wargames. The Commands & Colors system however, was simple and elegant enough to build up my interest in wargames to the point where it is today, and try branching out from the systems I'd stuck to before.

Fun easy to play game with a ton of battles to fight.  Cools figures as well rather than the pieces of cardboard.

I had hoped this reprint would have taken more risks with the original game. Having produced five or six new implementations of the Command and Colors system, I figured Richard Borg would have back-loaded a few of the system's evolutions back into this, the original game. There are a few changes, mostly to the cards, but not much in regards to the unit rules (aside from the General, anyway). The highlight is probably the fifteen new scenarios that have been added to the fifteen revised ones from the original game. Limited scenario selection was a very real issue in the game's initial release, since it was never expanded. I'm glad they piled extras into the Anniversary edition, because I doubt that an expansion is forthcoming for this version either. (At least while Hasbro has the reins...)

I gave the original a 10 for innovation and simplicity.  This new version only improves on that with slight modifications rather than adding a bunch of new rules.  If you want those, they're to be had on the fan sites.  More scenarios and some modifications to the deck improve the interplay.  A great fun game.

So I decided that I wanted to get into some light wargaming.  I did my research and found out that this would be a solid game to start with.  After my first play (a devastating loss, I might add) I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It has dice combat and card management that works really well together.  The game is fairly simple to learn and teach and doesn't take long to play.  I look forward to more experience with this game.

Ugly minis, but the map, token, and card art is absolutely fabulous. Very good choice on Borg's part to [b]not[/b] introduce unit variety and nîche rules from the go, but to reserve these for the scenario notes. (Contrast the bloated mess that is CC:Napoleonics.) - Great in play, and like the brief scenario notes on the historical background.

Nov 2011. Wow, it even works solo, and plays incredibly fast. e.g 20 minutes on Antietam. Not just the scenario notes but the naming of historic sites on the scenario maps adds greatly to the historic feel. I doubt the game is very historic once the cards hit the table, but at least the starting position feels very faithful.

Just plain fun. Eye Candy counters and magnificent components from Hasbro. Civil War enthusiasts will probably want to add some optional rules of their own to correct some non-historical game aspects.

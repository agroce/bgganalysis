This is a perfect length game for lunch at work.  It plays well even with just two, but obviously shines with 5.  We use a house rule that lets you use mask cards to move a piece backwards--it adds some strategy to hold on to them in some cases, and allows interesting upsets towards the end.  I've probably played this game 15  times since buying it, and it will most likely see a lot more play at work, as well.  It's easy to teach to non-gamers, and a good taste of more decision-based gaming.  I would definitely recommend it--games that can be satisfactorily played in 15 to 20 minutes are a really good part of a collection.

Got this to the table as a "last game of the night". We played with 3, and although it played quickly - it didn't have a real thrill for me. I'll probably break this game out sparingly in the future - only if someone requests it or I do a jungle/archeology themed game day.

Not a bad game, just not enough there to want me to play often.  Try to collect cards to move your token without letting people know who you are.  Similar to Heimlich and Co./Undercover.

A straight-faced bluffing game. Didn't go over with the lunch group as well as some "take that" games have/might because of the secrecy about what character you are -- we like to inflict pain and then laugh about it. (See, say, Family Business, or Drakon.)

A quick game of trying to keep your identity hidden while figuring out every one else's.  The game is moderately fun, sometimes a bit too light for my taste.  Could be a decent filler, but will probably get more play with the kids I work with who like it. Makes me want to try Top Secret Spies

RATING: 7
I'm always a sucker for secret role/goal games, and to find one that is this simple to teach/learn is a treat.  Every time I've played this game it has been a close battle to the finish.  I almost enjoy the game more with less than the full complement of players, because it's neat to have that unknown hanging out there.  I've even seen someone make another player win because he suspected that no one controlled that character and he guessed wrong.

The downside of the game is that often people will just move all the characters willy-nilly simply to avoid giving any information about who they are.  This leads to a log-jam at the finish line and at that point it becomes simply a game of "who can draw enough of their character's cards first?"  When the intrigue is eliminated and it starts to boil down to luck of the draw then some of the fun disappears.  But still for a simple hidden role game that you can play with all ages this is a winner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
An okay game, though the strategy seems to be let others move your color while you try to collect six cards which will let you move yourself to the win on one turn.  Very light and fun with the right crowd.

It is very light and quite random, but I like it. It is so short that the lack of strategic play does not bother me like it woul din a longer game. A nice diversion when you have 20 mins over.

Update 080308: Raising the rating to 8. I can not see my myself not wanting to play this. It is just too short to become boring, and the gameplay is fun and has enough choices for both kids and adults. I play it with my wife and with my 7 year old daughter, and it is great with both. Recommended!

RATING: 6
Fun for a while, but the randomness of the endgame (seems like you're only playing 3/4 of a game) and the fact that Clans is way, WAY better meant time to get rid of this.


I like this one.  Quite simple and streamlined and yet pretty satisfying to keep your secret identity hidden for as long as possible.  The theme makes a bit better sense than Clans, and the game is shorter.  Sometimes you get screwed with your card draw, but for a game that should last all of 15 minutes, this is OK.  Fun to play several times in a row.  Even more fun to name the characters based on people you know :)

RATING: 4
A very simple race game where you try to move your guy the fastest via card play.  You can also screw over the other players by making them land in quicksand.  Everyone's identity is hidden, so you're never sure if you're advancing an opponent or not, although everyone's identity becomes pretty obvious by the end.  Overall, I'd take it or leave it, but it's not terrible for a 10 minute race game.

Reminds me of Heimlich & Co., but takes a lot less time, which is a big point in its favor.  In my group, Heimlich & Co. devolved into everybody moving each spy one space every turn.  But this game allows players to streamline their hands, giving them a reasonable chance at attempting a breakaway.

Also, my five-year-old was able to teach this game to another player!

Kids (6 and 4, m and f respectively) love it! I'm surprised at how much they love it. It gets mum and dad and sister and brother to the table on a regular basis lately!

RATING: 5.5
Nice light game with a clever mechanic or two. The quicksand is a cool mechanism, but the on-board quicksand spaces are pointless. I wish this aspect had been better thought out. If you move a character on to a quicksand tile, you just moved it one space closer to the finish line. Sure, they have to spend a card to get unstuck, then another to advance, but it's the same number of cards (two) they would have spent anyway to get to that space, even if there had been no quicksand involved. So you actually helped them out by putting them in the quicksand. What am I missing? This query/critism does not apply to the quicksand *cards* which serve their function very well. 

On my first game, I revealed my character's identity too early. I was over 2/3 of the way to the finish, and I had plenty of good cards, so it seemed safe to do so. Boy, was I wrong! Fun game. I wish the board art had been better. They missed a great opportunity to put some really stylish jungle map artwork on the gameboard. Instead we get something that looks quick and cartoony. I feel a better board would have really enhanced the theme and feel (and probably game sales as well). But of course this doesn't affect gameplay, so it's a minor gripe.

UPDATE: Played again. I still think this is a decent game, but overall I'm underwhelmed. Seems like it would work best with about 4 players. TRADED for a copy of Aqueduct.

Feels like its a racing children game.

Some bluffing. Simple, light, luck, not a lot of control. Not that deep of a game.

I played Clans and Clans is much better. Seems Quicksand is a Clans lite. Could be good for non-gamers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Okay, but bogs down near the end and comes down to the luck of the draw. A player can increase the number of card drawn through some strategic play, but not a whole lot a fun. Will give it a couple of more plays, but don't think its deep enough to change my mind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is a racing game with secret roles where you can and at some points will be required to move other player's pieces.  I typically love secret roles in a game but this game was rather dull and random, but at least it's quick and easy.  I think there are better gateway games, but you could use this as one.  I think the game could be better if landing a character on their proper space would enact a unique character ability rather than just allow you to discard cards.  It would be easy enough to homebrew but probably not worth the effort in the end.  The art in this game is definitely lacking for a FFG game.

This is a pretty simple game -- the only twist is not knowing who is who.  There is some psycho-strategy involved as you try to get people to think you are someone you're not.

Broken? Well, maybe not... But close to! I mean, if you dont draw cards of your color there is not much you can do. Bluff? There is some of it, but as soon as you start using mask cards you are... unmasked! And the finish? Everybody is up there at the same time because... well... the cards are distributed evenly! The quicksand mechanism and mask do not make up for this. Don't let anybody convince you that this one is better than either Heimlich & Co, Clans, or Familienbande, all of which are much better!

Okay this has to be the most underrated game on BGG.  Sure it really doesn't look like much.  To tell the truth looking inside the box I was very disapointed in the game.  You can't judge a game by it's artwork though.  This is one of the best 3-5 player games out there when you just want something quick and easy that still has just enough strategy.  The mechanics are incredably simple, play a set of coloured cards to move a guy.  Get your guy to the finish first.  The strategy comes in with the fact no one knows who is who.  So this is a bit of a bluffing game where you need to move other peoples players closer to the finish or else give yourself away and spend the entire game stuck in quicksand.

Funnt bluffing game. One thing I liked a lot.... if a neutral reachs the goal, you continue playing :) so it has more sense to power them (than Heimlich for instance)

If it wasn't so transparent who you are pretty quickly it would be a nice bluffing game. But it isn't hard to know who the other players are halfway through the game. By then it is just a luck of draw.

2-1-10
Lowered from a 7 to a 6 (started at an 8).  Below comments still apply, but I realize more and more that I don't ever particularly feel like playing this game since the first half is so unnecessary.  Sure, you *might* be able to find out who someone is, but people are mostly just using their junk cards to move everyone else.  I still have fun when playing it, but not quite as much as similarly rated 7s.

I thought I might be playing this one a bit more with its short play time and ease of learning but no such luck.  The biggest problem I have is the first half of the game feels fairly meaningless.  Since everyone is getting cards of every color, every character is going to get moved up.  It isn't until the final 10-12 spaces where things feel like they have any game-changing impact.  Granted, you're still trying to figure out who each player is the entire game but with the nature of the cards it's difficult to tell since everyone is moving everyone.  The below comments still apply and I'd still like to play this one with the right people but an 8 just felt a wee bit generous.

I can't argue with the price I paid for this one from FF's holiday sale.  It's light fare that's easy to teach and play with a bit of bluffing and strategy.  Especially in a 2-player game where there are 4 unknowns, you can have some interesting movement to keep the other person off guard.

Hidden identity race of the move-any-figure-towards-the-finish-line variety, with some minor wrinkles.

At 20 minutes to play, this game is actually a reasonalbly fun filler desipite the heavy luck factor. It has going for it flexibility in which cards you play each turn, an intersting anonymous 'take that' mechanic, and a little meta game of trying to figure out who is who.

[2006.Dec.04] A clever, filler game that can be quite entertaining to play. The game is one part racing and two parts hand management with a dash of bluffing thrown in. As Silver Line game (by Fantasy Flight Games), it comes in the usual compact box, so it won't take up a lot of space on your game shelf. It's easy to learn and fun to play. Try it, you may just like it!

Very fun game, just long enough play time for what it is.  It plays equally well with 5 as it does with 3.  Simple, elegant, plenty of room for attempts at strategy... high chaos factor, but clearly some players will learn to play better than others and win far more often, so despite the chaos, the game rewards careful Jedi mind tricks, hand management and pacing.  One of the best filler games I own.

I like secret identity games and this one sure isn't the best, but it doesn't dissapoint either. 

So far it just seems like the whole game boils down to the last few turns, since no one wants to push any pawn too far ahead to maintain their secrecy, the whole group doesn't ever get too spread out. Fortunately, it's quick and those last few turns are a lot of fun.

Plays 2-5. what a surprise! This is a hidden-identity race game. Be the first to move your explorer to the finish (loosely in the spirit of Titan:the Arena) but conceal your identity while doing so. 

Plays well with 2. Even when it becomes obvious what color your opponent is the game still offers some enjoyable game play. If you like hand-management you will like Quicksand.

Rather good game that goes down well with non-gamer friends. Always a tense finish and we'll tend to play on such that all but one will not complete the game. Recommendation to allow people to discard one card belonging to completed explorers to improve one's hand.

I wish there were more games with quicksand! Such a rich and dangerous peril for a board game! This is a game similar to Schildkrotenrenen or the Garlic Vampires, but I really like the use of the card mechanic in this game; however many cards of a color you play determines your movement. 

A pretty good game for 2-6 players!

Meh.  Games where you are forced into making suboptimal plays just because of the cards in hand don't do it for me.  With a little more control over the cards you draw this could be a neat little game, but it's not my cup of tea as printed.

RATING: 6
It's better then it looks! And it looks quite bad... which means it might acurally be not so good a game... but it is a fun game to tell the truth. You don't get the idea just from reading the rules, but since you have a fairly limited hand of cards and the identities are secret, you'll find yourself playing other game pieces quicker then you think. This makes for some interesting diversions, especially if your opponents start moving your playing piece :)
It's an overall good and fun game, just a pitty about the weak illustration and board design.

RATING: 6
Heimlich & Co type game with cards instead of dice, so better than the predecessor as you have a hand of cards to consider out of turn rather than making decisions when the die is rolled.
Also alot less number crunching, more on card counting. Obviously, you're limited to cards you get, but there are opportunities to recycle your cards quickly. Quicksand spaces/cards slow down players but I feel that explorers shouldn't be allowed to jump over others which may make the game more tactically interesting with some blocking and forced movement.

Very easy to understand and teach to others.  I enjoy the hidden-role aspect of it and the deductive side of the game when trying to figure out who each player is.  On the whole, it's not deep but it is a very nice, light filler.  The only real problem I have is that the game is simply too short.

RATING: 8.5
(Revised rating up past 8 - for the niche it fills, it is very good)  A fun filler! Plays quick, light, and accomodates 2-5 (IMO 6) players. Almost no time to learn - just start playing and see the (admittedly limited) strategies play out. I have a heck of a time guessing what color (sneaky) adults are playing many times, since you invariably have to move tokens that are not your own. 6 and 7 year-olds can play this, they just aren't as good at covering up what token is theirs. 

4 house rules (always play 1 and 2, sometimes 3, thinking of 4): 
House Rule #1) White should start play up one further (opposite of red) since he has the longest to go (15 spaces vs everyone else's 14). 
House Rule #2) Discarded cards should be face-down to hide what you are getting rid of (instead of announcing to everyone who you aren't playing).
House Rule #3) Landing on a mask-space allows you to re-fill that 1 discard from either the top of the deck [b]or[/b] the discards deck (pick up the discard deck and secretly choose one of them - this speeds up the game and makes for more aggressive play).
House Rule #4) Whenever someone pushes a piece to the temple that doesn't belong to any human (and is therefore placed back at the starting space), it acts as a wild (Tiki) space.

Xe Queo is a much better game of this type.  In Quicksand, you're pretty much stuck playing every card you get whether you want to or not, so you have very very little control over what happens; in Xe Queo you have complete control (by analogy, you pick which cards you get), leaving a pure bluffing game, a tense psychological battle with all the good that is in Quicksand and none of the random lack of control.

This has similar mechanics as Mr. Jack in that players control all characters and are trying to get their hidden character to a goal without revealing who they are.  The game is fairly linear, but it might be interesting with larger players looking for a quick (and very light) change of pace.

This is a great lightweight game of bluffing, and is one of the better light 2-player games. I almost didn't get this game. However, I had pulled out Inkognito (another of FFG's Silver Line games) when it arrived during FFG's blowout holiday sale. My wife saw the ad for Quicksand on the side of the box and asked if I had gotten it. Sadly (since she doesn't often get excited about games) I hadn't ordered it. Fortunately, the sale was still going on so I was still able to get it.

Fast and enjoyable. A game will last you around 30 minutes. It's a nice time filler where you try and get your guy to the end first, but... nobody but you knows which token is yours and they might have to move yours too! 

Similar to Ticket to Ride in that you get color cards and play them. X number of cards = X number of moves for that color. Plus you can trap pieces in quicksand making it take more cards to move forward.

A simple game that scales well with 6 players. A lot of Indiana Jones type explorers are attempting to be the first to get to the temple.

Explorers use like coloured cards to move pieces. There are also wild cards and 'quicksand' cards that slow other explorers down. The catch is that each player's explorer is secret. This reults in bluff and second guessing as players aren't sure who to sabotage!

This game calls out for variants and is good simple fun for what it is. Cheap too.

A fun quick filler game.  Objectively, the beginning of the race seems pointless, and the end can come down to the luck of the draw.  However, there's is no denying that I have a blast playing it throughout.  The strategy comes in the hand management and the fun comes in the bluffing.  The graphic design is a bit obvious and childish, but this seems fitting because it probably shines as a family game.

Um...ok sort of game that feels more like a souped up children's game.  This is certainly something that would be worthwhile for 9 or 10 year olds.

Best described as "The Dance of Three Condoms", everyone tries to play it extra safe.

RATING: 5
Can't say that this is particularly interesting. Yes, there is a hidden player element and you can use quicksand either via a card or movement to slow others down, but certainly nothing that is super special here. However, my kids have really taken to it, and while it is obvious which players they are, they do seem to like playing cards and moving the explorers around, so there's that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Decent hidden-identities racing game but just not as good as Schildkroetenrennen (for 3 players) or Heimlich & Co. (for larger groups).  The former has a better bluffing mechanism and the latter involves more strategy and less luck than Quicksand.

Falls into that limbo region where it's a little too much for kids but too easy for adults, therefore not appealing to any age group.

Brilliant quick-playing game of bluffing, hand-management, and racing.  Shines with 3 players, but 2 to 4 is strong.  5 players is the weakest with little overall strategy involved at that point.  Sets up in 2 minutes, explains to new players in less than that.  Plays in about 15.

RATING: 5
[6 plays] Okay not a great game.  At best it is a light weight filler that can help kill time in long car trips or be played while waiting for players to play a real game.  I ended up getting this game on clearance.  The bluffing in this game only works if played 2 or 3 player.  4-5 player games are just flat out broken.  Even in 2-3 player games, most of the time it is just decided by who has the better card drawing at the very end of the game.  Originally rated them game a 4, but bumped it up to a 5 as it can be a decent "family" game.  The kids and wife enjoy it and it plays fast.

This took my wife and I by surprise. As new members of the board game world, this was picked up cheap at a second hand store and blew us away by its simplistic and fun style. For 2 players, this game shines, we each have a character color but have no idea who is who. Play cards rummy style or one at a time and move the characters across the board while secretly trying to get your piece there first!

Easy game for the whole family and the type of game after it's over you say, "ok, lets play that again." If you find this little gem, try it out, well worth it.

I enjoy the bluffing aspect. Trying to remain secret is more important than it first appears, as revealing yourself only gives the other players a colour to avoid playing, and a handy quicksand target. Takes all of 1 minute to each and 10 minutes to play, makes a great filler.

RATING: 6
A decent gateway game or filler, but nothing all that amazing.  Reminds me of those 5+ Knizia titles each year that are short, fast, and mostly inoffensive, but that you never touch again after you play them once.  Cycling through your hand is interesting, and there's a bit more strategy with fewer players, but chaos will rule the day no matter how many players there are.  Traffic jams can develop where your options become pretty limited.  Still, as far as racing games go, this one is fast and light.  You can find better games, but you can certainly find a lot of worse games in this genre.

It's like Clans-lite.  VERY lite.  In fact, it's like a cross between Candyland and Clans.  It's Clandyland!

*Owned for school - single copy*  My students have had a lot of fun with Quicksand this year.  They really got into blocking the pathway and sneaking different pieces forward.

Gave it to my dad who felled in love with this game and doesn't pass a day without playing it with my mom.

It's their #1 game, HIGHLY rated 10 for them!

June 2017: got a copy NIS...
Priceless souvenir for me

Light and quick.  Easy to bluff early on but how late do you leave it to make the move to the finish line...?

RATING: 5
A light game that is the exactly the right length for the depth of decisions. Very good filler, even if it‚Äôs an ugly game.

This game deserves more love here at BGG.  Quick, light, and a good game for some simple bluffing.  The end game usually remains quite close.

Great mystery mechanic.

I rate it an 7 for a kids game, maybe a 6 for adults.  I do enjoy this with the kids, tho.  Another "something different" that beats the other mainstream games.

RATING: 6
Has horrible endgame issues (what happens if I can't move any pieces, or if I can only cause another player to win?), but still manages to be fun for kids and their parents.

Very fast and simple racing game with a bluffing element.

The kids love this one so it gets a high rating. A hidden gem in my collection.

After a few plays I find this an enjoyable game. Doesn't really matter whether we're two or more, it's quick and fun.

Who would have expected this to become a house favorite? fast and fun are key with the added secrecy. I didn't expect this to be well worth the 4$ I paid for it, but hey, it is!

Also this is the game that made me give in and start using decimal places. I think this game is better than a 6, but not a 7. I will have to recalibrate my ratings sometime...

I bought this on the cheap planning to trade it... but after getting a chance to play I'm glad it didn't go in the math trade!  Its very light... but has a much different feel from other quick fillers due to the spacial element and interesting take on card management.  Its hard to maintain a bluff throughout a game as usually you want your guy to make a break for it at the end, but if you can be patient its a lot of fun to watch someone else move you into the winning position!

Candyland for adults?  Not quite.  It's a bit more than that.  For filler, it's OK.  I'd rather play something else, though.

Okay to play with the kids!  Not impressed at all for play with adults only.

RATING: 5.9
Light fun, better with a lot of players. Probably suited more to the younger end of the gaming market, but some bluffing play adds appeal for mature gamers.

RATING: 7
The best things about this simple who's-who race game are how quickly it plays and how easy it is to teach, while allowing for some bluffing and teasing.

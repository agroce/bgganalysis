Ra-lite (no "bad" cards), but still a good game. Marginally quicker than the original, and the theme fits much better. A good "gateway" game.

RATING: 6
A nice little game with original bidding mechanics. The art is awful but serves it purpose. I also like how many different strategies you can employ in a subsequent rounds, and how the game builds up tension towards the end of each round. Not sure about the longevity, but should stand the test of regular playing.

Some advice - make sure you shuffle the cards really well before playing as they will clump together.

La versión de cartas de Ra! de Knizia. Con v todas las buenas cosas de éste y mejorando la "transportabilidad" del juego, una maravillosa cajita pequeña. 

Genial a 2jugadores también. 
Muy pocas cosas malas;complicado de conseguir porque esta ya descatalogado y que faltan los desastres del Ra para ser un diez.

A gem of an auction game. I haven't played Ra but I thought this was great. The theme/artwork is fun, and despite the awkward card size I really like its compactness, in terms of both the components and playing time.  Edit: Having now played Ra, I still think this is great.

Curious thing to play this game.  This is virtually identical to Knizia's Ra, but curiously, I really enjoy this game more.  

True, this version of the game is modest in production, but I have to agree with my friend: Razzia is "faster, more portable, and better themed." Interesting.  Cards versus chits? Not sure why I like this one so much more.

[i]Posted: 1/7/09, Rated: 8[/i]

[i]Razzia![/i] had crept onto my wishlist a long time ago, but trying to get a copy shipped over from Germany was never a priority.  When the opportunity arrived to acquire a copy in trade, I jumped at it.

Now, I had played its progenitor [i][thing=12]Ra[/thing][/i], both on BSW and in person.  I loved the Egyptian theme of that bigger title, as well as the terror of a disaster tile.  However, the drawback to those considerations was a higher level of analysis paralysis for what was a pretty straightforward auction and set collection game.  [i]Razzia![/i] solves this dilemma by doing away with disasters.

The mobster theme of [i]Razzia![/i] works, which I think is quite clever since it harkens back to the older title.  Trying to explain to my two sons why the moll is smiling without mentioning prostitution is a little tricky.  I was also impressed by the compactness of this game: instead of tiles there is one big deck of cards.  Its demure size made [i]Razzia![/i] the better travel companion over the summer.

A simplified version of a good game, readily accessible to the entire family, and highly portable to take on trips?  That's a solid contender all the way around.

I picked this up because I thought it would be a faster and more portable version of Ra (which I own and love). But it didn't seem to be much faster, and if you have a draw-bag, Ra doesn't really take up that much more room...and when you take away those wonderfully nasty disaster tiles and the groovy Egyptian theme, why would I want to play Razzia?

I thought Ra was just OK, but I thought I'd give it a second chance by buying it in a smaller, cheaper form.  Like Ra, you probably won't enjoy your first playing; it may take a few tries before you can appreciate it.

I didn't get it. Maybe the next time I enjoy it but by now it doesn't appeal to me to play it.

*Update*

More than two years after my only one Razzia game I have read and understand Ra rules and play it against the AI. I realize that Razzia is the same game but without disasters and I like Ra a lot to the point of wanting to get a copy for my collection... 

Maybe I wasn't prepared for Razzia when I played it. So now I improve my Razzia's rating from 5.5 to 7 (I still prefer Ra though)

Sadly this game gets compared to Ra. Now, I don't love Ra, because even though I love the questions the game poses as to what to collect and how much is a an auctioning collection worth to me compared to others and how much can people actually pay. But, the random round endings can leave me feeling very frustrated when at times when a statistically unlikely round ending happens.

Razzia has all of the frustration, but less of the fun because there are fewer tiles in the game. So auctioning collections are smaller and easier to evaluate and rounds end sooner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I finally got to break Razzia! out for the first time and everyone kept wanting to play.
Edit:...and for good reason.  There are some suprisingly interesting choices to make in this pure bidding game.  Forcing the bid, at the right time, can make your lesser checks (fixed amounts of bidding money?) have more buying power.  At the end of the game, whether I win or lose, I can see the empire that my crime family made.  Makes me feel like I did something.

RATING: 7
Doesn't do it for me as much as Ra does.  The production value for the cost is definitely part of it.  I like the small, compact, robust tiles of Ra compared to these cards.  I also think the number of police per round should change with the number of players.  With 3, the rounds were just over too soon.  The lack of catastrophes is actually good for 3, because the bidding is not so open.  With 4 or 5, I think catastrophe tiles add a much needed wrinkle to the game.  Also, there aren't any tiles to keep score with.  I will wait for my next chance to get Ra.  This can be a substitute, but only that.

This remake of the Classic Ra has a better theme/mechanic fit, and is much more portable.  But it and its parent have dropped in my estimation with repeated playings (>20), as I find the game has become tedious and predictable.

Definitely Ra lite.  In our games, the "Razzia!" cards seem to come out much faster than the Ra tiles in the original game.  This, and the lack of negative tiles, seem to suck some of the development possibilities and angst out of the game.  Still, it's a fast game with some interesting decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Ra, the cardgame, but then without the disaster tiles. That is Razzia! in a nutshell. The conversion is more or less okay, but a cursory game quickly showed me and my gaming partners (all of us experienced Ra-players) that without those disasters, the row of cards you bid on becomes really quite bereft of tension. It is very easy to let a row of cards grow to its maximum because you know that save for the Razzia-cards, [i]every card[/i] you draw is useful. In Ra, a disaster tile can sweep away a carefully collected set of point-critical tiles costing you valuable points; in Razzia! this is impossible. This very small change saps most of the tension out of what is a great auction game. Given the choice between original and the cardgame, the former wins by a very, very large margin.

Really, why was this game made in the first place? Why not simply print Ra on cards and be done with it?

Ra's little brother.
 
The biggest difference is the absence of the disaster tiles.  The result is a serious change to the feel and balance of the game.  I like the possibility of the poison-pill in Ra, it hurts the players with all the tiles.  It also adds that extra bit of angst when pulling that extra tile.

I also really miss the wooden Ra piece, and the board and the tiles too.  Card games are nice, but I'm a bits guy.  The small cards a pain to shuffle.

But it's not Ra, it wasn't meant to be.  It can stand on its own very nicely and it's definitely fun.  A nice addition to the Ra family of games (which I'd say includes "It's Mine!" also).

Components: Wonderful art that makes it very easy to differentiate between the different types of cards.  The 'x' on some types of cards is a welcome addition. The cards are quality, but too small.  The money tokens are a huge step down from their Ra counterparts.  And there needs to be a marker for the active player, like in Ra; following an auction, it's often very difficult to remember whose turn it is.

Experience: I find the set collecting to be a lot easier in this version, probably because of the theme and art.  As always, the money-swapping mechanism is great, and the more I play it and get to know the different ways to score, the more I enjoy it.

Well this is the definitive game! This is a remake of the now-classic Ra! game. I have never played the original, but from what I've seen and read it looks bland and is heavily overproduced as compared to Razzia.

RATING: 7
Ra plays better because of the extra tiles (especially disasters) but Razzia! is nearly as good and has a much better theme.

For components, cards don't work quite as well as tiles.  Efficiently shuffling such a large stack of small cards is much tougher than simply throwing tiles into a sack. However, the small box size keeps Razzia! nicely portable.

Date du texte: 2005

Razzia est la réédition du fameux jeu Ra, considéré par beaucoup comme l'un des tout meilleurs jeu d'enchères qui soit.

But du jeu: gagner le maximum de points lors des décomptes qui ont lieu à la fin des 3 manches de la partie.

Préparation

En début de partie, les joueurs se voient attribuer des lots de cheques dont la répartition dépend du nombre de joueurs:

3 joueurs :
Joueur A: 2,000, 5.000, 8.000, 13,000
Joueur B: 3,000, 6.000, 9.000, 12,000
Joueur C: 4,000, 7.000, 10.000, 11,000
4 Joueurs:
Joueur A: 2,000, 6.000, 13,000
Joueur B: 3,000, 7.000, 12,000
Joueur C: 4,000, 8.000, 11,000
Joueur D: 5,000, 9.000, 10,000
5 Joueurs:
Joueur A: 2,000, 7.000, 16,000
Joueur B: 3,000, 8.000, 15,000
Joueur C: 4,000, 9.000, 14,000
Joueur D: 5,000, 10.000, 13,000
Joueur E: 6,000, 11.000, 12,000

Le cheque de valeur 1000 est posé sous la bande de carton qui fait office de plateau de jeu, les cheques non utilisés sont mis de coté. Chaque joueur place ses cheque devant soi et face visible.

Le jeu

A son tour un joueur a 3 options:

1ere option: tirer une carte

Si c'est une carte butin elle rejoint le lot de cartes mis aux enchères.

Cas particulier : si c'est la 7eme carte du lot une enchère automatique est lançée, si personne n'encherit, les 7 cartes sont mises de coté définitivement

Si la carte tirée est une carte Razzia, une enchère automatique est lancée, la carte Razzia reste au centre de la table prés des cartes butin et du chèque avec les cartes Razzia précédement tirées.

Dés que la 7eme carte Razzia est tirée, la manche s'arrete immédiatement et un décompte est effectué.

2 eme option: lancer une enchère

Une enchère se déroule sur un seul tour de table qui finit par le joueur dont c'est le tour. L'objet de l'enchère est constitué à la fois de l'ensemble des cartes butins présentes au centre de la table et du cheque qui se trouve à coté. Les joueurs, peuvent passer ou surencherir en utilisant un de leur cheque encore disponible.

Note: le joueur qui a déclanché volontairement une enchère doit encherir si personne n'a enchèri avant lui. Du coup un joueur qui n'a pas de cheque disponible, ne peut lancer une enchère.

Le meilleur enchèrisseur gagne donc les cartes qu'il pose faces visibles devant lui, et le cheque central qu'il pose face cachée (indisponible pour le reste de la manche). Le cheque qui lui a permis de gagner cette enchère le remplace au centre du plateau et fera donc partie de la prochaine enchère.

3eme option: utiliser une de ses cartes voleur

Si le joueur possede une carte voleur , il peut décider de la défausser pour prélever une carte butin de son choix dans le lot qui est en cours.

A la fin de la premiere et la seconde mache une fois les décomptes éffectués, les cartes avec une croix sont défaussées et l'ensemble des cartes

Les décomptes

Il y a 2 décomptes intermédiares et un décompte final.

Pour le décompte intermediaire:

Cartes Or : 3 pts chaque

Cartes Chauffeur: 1 pt chaque

Cartes Taxi: 1pt chaque à condition d'avoir au moins une carte Chauffeur, sinon 0.

Cartes Garde du corps: le (ou les) joueur qui en a le plus marque 5 pts, le (ou les) joueur qui en a le moins perdent 2 pts.

Carte Bijou: si le joueur n'a aucune carte bijou devant lui il perd 5 pts, s'il en a 1 ou 2 son score est inchangé, s'il en a 3 il gagne 5 pts, s'il en a 4 il gagne 10 pts, pour 5 c'est 15 pts.

Pour le décompte final:

On procède comme ci dessus avec en plus:

Les chèques: le (ou les) joueur qui a la plus forte valeur totale en chèque face visible reçoit un bonus de 5 pts. le (ou les) joueurs qui ont la plus faible valeur total en chèque face visible perdent 5 pts.

Les cartes entreprises (cartes marron): c'est un peu plus compliqué car il y a 2 bonus à distribuer pour ce type de carte. Le premier prend en compte le nombre total de carte entreprise possédé quel qu'en soit le type ( casino, hippodrome...). De 1 à 6 carte le joueur marque autant de point qu'il a de cartes. Avec 7 cartes et plus il marque 10 pts. D'autre part il y a un bonus par collection d'un même type de carte: 3 cartes entreprise identiques c'est un bonus de 5 pts et 4 cartes entreprises identiques 10 pts.

Mon opinion

Je fais partie de ceux qui pensent que Razzia est supérieur à son ancêtre; le vénéré Ra.
Les modifications mineures n'ont rien enlevé à la tension du jeu et on a gagné énormément en fluidité. Dans Ra les décisions étaient rendues difficiles à prendre à cause des cartes désastres négatives qui font partie du lot sur lequel on enchérit, ce qui du coup occasionnait parfois des blocages car personne n'était intéressé par le lot.
Maintenant le jeu n'est pas pour autant facile, il y a toujours plein de cartes à avoir avant l'arrivée du décompte mais on se concentre davantage sur le plaisir de jouer et c'est bien mieux. Le jeu possède un bel équilibre entre effort et plaisir et s'impose facilement auprès du public familial.
Le seul bémol par rapport à la précédente édition c'est qu'il est maintenant indispensable de bien mélanger les cartes (c'est long, même très long) alors qu'avant on piochait une tuile à l'aveuglette.

Razzia présente un excellent rapport entre la durée d'une partie et la tension qu'elle génère, c'est un des très rares jeux (autre que les jeux de plis) où je suis capable d'enchainer les parties malgré la concurrence que représente mes étagères bien remplies.
Le jeu repose uniquement sur un système d'enchères, mais il a réussi à devenir un incontournable chez moi.

You probably can't go wrong riffing on Ra, and Knizia got it right with this game. Razzia simplifies Ra (no disasters) more than I would like, but Razzia is more portable --- excellent for travel.

Another cheap ebay finding. Eager to try it. Rating and comment will follow.

[2006-05-22]
My group gave Razzia! a shot yesterday and I have to say that we weren't disappointed. There are quiet a few tough decisions to be made, so Razzia! keeps you thinking constantly. On the other hand there is a quiet some luck in the card-draws but it didn't bother me too much since the playtime is rather short (~40 minutes with 3 players). I guess the luck-component would bother me more if the game was longer. Maybe Razzia! might be our new Filler game.

+ quiet a few tough decisions to be made here.
+ Nice Artwork and the theme works for me.
+ Short playtime

- Maybe a little bit too much luck, but I might think different after a few more plays.

Ra's little sister.  Very similar, but without the catastrophe tiles, which does make it a little less of a gamer's game.  However, this has a much better theme and you can also carry it around in your pocket.

For some reason I really prefer Ra to this one even if it's almost the same game. Gets better with more plays and the theme actually fits better here than with Ra.

RATING: 7
Nearly identical game to the superb Ra.  The theming has changed from ancient Egypt to the Mafia, which takes a bit of getting used to for 50+ game Ra players!  The only rules I could spot missing were the "disaster" tiles that remove player's holdings, which is a shame as they created a lot of the decision anguish over the auction lots.  Still, if you want a stripped down, portable version of Ra, it's all here.

RATING: 8.5
More compact and rethemed version of the classic auction game Ra (without disaster tiles), but with a Mafia theme.  Thoughts after several dozen plays: This game would not appeal to everyone, but if you enjoy auction games, there's a good chance you'll like it.  For the short time it takes to play, it packs in a lot of fun, tension, and tough choices.  The rules and gameplay are quite straight-forward, but the trick is to know when and what to bid in order to get the combinations of cards that will score you the most points!  The theme is quite humorous too.  Also works with two player (games take 15-20 minutes, and there's more luck of the draw but it doesn't matter too much because of the quick play time), but it's best with more players and more interaction.  Probably also better with 3 or 4 than 5.  I think it's under-rated because people familiar with Ra miss the disaster tiles, but it is virtually as good a game in its own right.  Suggestion: use a marker (e.g. toy police car) of some kind to indicate who is doing the auction, i.e. whose turn it is.

Based on 36 plays.

Comparison to Ra, from which this game originates:
+ Cards are superior to cardboard tiles
+ Smaller box (portability)
+ Mafia theme makes sense (almost), compared to absurdity of Egypt
- There are no catastrophy cards

Overall comments:
+ Popular choice by my friends
+ The size of the cards (small) is about right
> Playtime 15 min, if pushed
> To help new players to learn the game, I have a backstory ready for each card type
- The theme, although nice, feels pasted on.

Since 2009, updated Dec 2011.

A surprisingly good conversion of Ra into a card game. It works and the card graphics are sufficiently strong to make the calculation easy (that is, you can quickly look at the players' holdings and work out who's most interested in the auction). But...it's still an auction game (at which I both suck and blow), and the numerous points and deductions are a tad heavy for a card game. It works for what it is, but I mark it down for what it is.

Played 10+ times. Takes one of the best auction games ever (Ra) and removes the little things I didn't like about it, leaving a near perfect auction game. Gone is the high price point, the decidely bewildering Egyptian theme, and the negative scoring ("Kill tiles"). The new theme is not just a switch, but is actually a much better theme fit (see my theme translations article). Two small complaints: the 2-player game isn't nearly as good as multi-player (scoring becomes very all or nothing) and would only rate a 7. Also, it doesn't come with a "Ra" token, or an equivalent, so players need to provide their own way for keeping track of the auctioneer. (We thought a fedora might be appropriate.) Absolutely fabulous game, made much cheaper, fun graphics, and the theme is a much better fit. Great game, perhaps the best auction game ever. My rating history: 9|10|9

Not sure i can rate it properly yet. Just like Ra but the bits could be better. I wish i didnt have to shuffle them so much through out the game. In Ra just picking the tiles out of the bag is much easier. I love this game after I figured out the general process of scoring (which can be complex to beginners) I recommend you play it a few times and get used to the scoring as that is usually the only negative to playing it.

RATING: 7.5
2 player game works well, and since you have more control over when an auction is called, having the lower checks can even be a position of power, forcing your opponent into some delicate decisions.  As you add more players, it's harder to create those situations by calling for an auction.  Either the goods up for auction are too worthless the first time around, or are too valuable by the time you get your next opportunity.  Luck of the draw plays a role in this regard.  

This is a fine game that I enjoy, although I find the valuation of everything pretty clunky.  5 points for this; -2 points for this; etc.

It's in vogue on Kickstarter to pack as much game as possible into a small box, like the Tiny Epic series. Razzia is just that. It's like Ra, only it plays quicker, and has a better theme that isn't arbitrary.  Great illustrations. The game plays quickly, and I don't miss the disasters really. The game is still plenty tense, as the 'Razzia!' cards can come up pretty quickly. Oh, and the game is very nice and compact as well.

Basically the same game as Ra, with a mobster theme and without the catastrophe tiles.  I enjoyed Ra enough that I bought this game simply to have a travel-sized version.  The lack of catastrophes isn't particularly noticeable, as each set of cards for auction continues to have different values for each player depending upon what they've already acquired.  The cards are those annoyingly small ones that are hard to shuffle, which means occasionally you'll have a large group of similar cards in a row if you don't make  special efforts to shuffle well.

The owner told me that this was similar to Ra (possibly a re-theming), and thinking it was a Knizia design, I agreed. Perhaps I missed the parallels, but I found this game to be annoying, and simply wished the game to end quickly. I enjoy Ra, but cannot recall why I didn't click with this re-theme. I just know I don't want to play it again.

This is essentially Ra, but with a different theme, and cards rather than tiles. There are fewer cards than there are tiles in Ra, and crucially there are no disasters. The theme probably means that new players will pick it up better (in particular thieves vs gods, and cars/drivers vs rivers/floods), but on the flip side the scoring explanation sheets are in German and no way to keep score is provided. It is also more portable than Ra. In most circumstances I'd rather play Ra, but this is not a bad game in itself.

I played Ra once, and personally much prefer the theme and aesthetics of the pieces. Having said that, Razzia loses very little in gameplay compared to Ra, and has the advantage of being available and cheap. If you're looking for a 'middle-weight filler' (a great category coined by someone in a geeklist), this will fill the slot perfectly - and you should have money left over for something else too!

I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I prefer Razzia! to Ra.  First, the mafia theming in Razzia!, while not perfect, makes far more sense than the bizarre and disconnected Egyptian theming of Ra.  Second, the slightly shorter playing length is perfect for a light game like this.  Third, cards are better-suited to the design than tiles.  Fourth, the box is smaller.  And fifth, the presentation makes it easier to introduce to non-gamers.  I agree that the lack of poison pill tiles is a loss, but not enough to outweigh the other advantages of Razzia!

Having played Ra before, I was initially a little disappointed with this, but I've now got used to having cards instead of tiles, cardboard cheques instead of wooden bidding tokens, etc, and using tokens to keep track of score improves things. The fact that the theme fits the game MUCH better than with Ra, plus it's shorter, sharper play time puts this one on a par for me, if not slightly ahead!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I may be in the minority, but I don't see the reason to play this instead of Ra.  I understand that before the Uberplay reprint, Ra was hard to find and many used this as a cheaper substitute.  I guess it might be more portable, but the small cards and little money chits are harder to keep organized, either on the board or in your player area, as well as harder to pick up.  It seems like the theme might be a little more non-gamer friendly.  The card distribution seems much different than the tile distribution in Ra.  I guess there's no disaster tiles here, but there seems to be a lot more "good stuff".  I guess I'm biased because I played Ra first, I could see how others would feel the opposite as me.

Portable version of Ra. Didn't like this as much. The lack of disasters made the auctions less fun, and the lack of text on the cards showed poor design. At the very least, the card scores could've been printed on them.

This is a fine re-tooling of RA. At first, I admit, I was hesitant to play/buy this game, as the cartoony graphics and theme weren't as appealing to me as the elegant design of those of its older broter. But the theme makes it more accessible to non-gamers (in that it is far easier to explain why bodyguards save you from losing points, and why gems are worth points, etc.) while simultaneously introducing them to that beautiful auction mechanic...

On another note, I simply cannot understand why the average rating on this game is 6.9 to RA's 7.8 -- they're pretty much the same game!

A much lighter version of Ra. Although Ra is probably the better gamer's game, here is what Razzia! has going for it:
* allows 2-players
* no catastrophe tiles, making for a happier game
* quick play (15 minutes for a 2-player game)
* more accessible theme.

The only downside is that this game is only available in German, but I recommend the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/file/info/9917]player's aids[/url] here on BGG as a necessary component to the game.

2-5p, 45m.  Knizia auction/bidding game.  Highly rated by enthused fans.  (A slightly simpler version of Ra.)  Different from other auction games in that it has all-different-denominated money (called checks).  Player aids and/or score sheets are a must!
Played lots at first, but for some reason not compelled to pull off the shelf these days, probably the fiddly scoring.  So I downgraded it from 8.5 to 7.5 on 12/12/2005.Downgrading from 7.5 to 7.0 on 12/12/2006 due to not playing it much.Received in an "ultimate trade" for San Juan in September 2005.

I love the portability of this version. It's the easiest way to bring a top-ranked game to a non-gaming get-together as a gateway game.  I personally like the omission of the disaster tiles from Ra. The disaster tiles add too much chance to a otherwise tight and elegent system.  But then again, I tend to prefer the more pure versions of Knizia's games (e.g., Schotten-Totten over Battle Line, Loco over Thor).

If it were 15 minutes longer it would have been a 6.

Nearly identical comment as Ra.

The last auction or two each round lend too much "push your luck" for the type of game this purposes to be.  Maybe it's just because it is more a "card" game versus a "board" game, people find this more forgiving than with Ra.  I have no idea why.

Razzia!! Bueno, para ser la primera partida, a mi me dejo un poco con la sensación de "¿y ya está?". He revisado las reglas y en principio, lo hicimos todo correctamente.

El sistema de pujas es bastante interesante, sabiendo no sólo que debes pujar por el botín, sino que a veces interesa pujar únicamente para quedarse con el cheque de valor alto para la siguiente ronda o la puntuación final.

Rethemed version of Ra; this has identical mechanics except that there are no disasters (which, in Ra, cause negative effects when players get them).  I like this better than Ra for two reasons: 1) there's no need to pass around a bag of bits, as there's just a single draw deck that sits in the middle of the table, and 2) the artwork is much better designed (e.g., cards that last only one round have a big X in the corner).  The second item makes the game much easier for new players to play (as does printing out player guides from BGG).  This is a luck-heavy game, wherein players must gamble that the round won't end before they can get the items they need; if you're looking for pure, deep strategy, this isn't the game for you.  But if you want a bit of quick, fun filler that does require tactical thinking, this could be for you.

I've played this twice with two players, and while it works, the effect of randomness seems to be enhanced.  It seems more fun with 3 or more people.

[Update: After more plays of this, I'm realizing more that the game is much more strategic/tactical than I originally thought, as the decisions on when to call auctions and when to use your bidding chips are actually very tough ones, and hence have increased the rating from 7.5.]

If you get used to the shuffling actually makes for a quicker game then Ra.  Cards also feel more intutive for the game then tiles, but maybe that is just me.  Also great to be offically 2-5 players.  There should also be an expansion for the negative tiles from Ra.

This is Ra without the catastrophe tiles, and they also reduced the total number of tiles, which makes it a game that I would not want to play, since I could always play Ra. Viewing it on its own, it has become a longish filler and the ingenious auction mechanism is still there.

RATING: 6
--- Preliminary thoughts ---

Ra with cards and without disaster tiles.

IMO, Ra is better, even if the disaster tiles are not "fair", because they hamper some players more than others, depending on what they have.

It doesn't make sense to own both, except for auction game geeks.

To be fair, I probably should rate it 0.5 higher. I don't do it because of Ra (even if Ra came later in time).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Auction game where you always have only a few values you can bid. I really like Razzia's auction mechanism. It forces you to make right moves at the right times. I like Razzia's theme more than Ra's. Mechanics-wise Ra might be a bit more interesting because of destruction tiles. Works well with 3-5 players.

RATING: 8
I am admittedly tainted by not having played the 'daddy' game of Ra, but Razzia seems to be an excellent game in bidding and optimisation, and deserving of more recognition than it apparently gets. The cash-exchange aspect of the game is a total winner, and when combined with the do-I-force-an-auction or not rule, provides something a lot more complex than you had any right to expect. Some dull spreadsheet-keeping is the major downside.

Further Thoughts: I love this game - so why is it so hard to get anyone to play it with me?

Maybe the lack of calamity cards reduced a lot of tension as well, knowing good stuff was always going to be coming out, and therefore you were only racing against the auction cards. Still a good game, just not as good as the original.

Very cool auctioning game. It is cheap and offers a lot of fun for its price!
I don't know Ra, but this one appeals to me very much! Having played it several times I finally raised the vote to 9! I am more than happy when I can play this gem again!
The scoring mechanism and the fiddly setup hinder this game from becoming a 10!
Update: This game has lost some of its shine because of the fiddly scoring aspect. Still a VERY good game! 8 might be its final vote!

I bought this from Germany, because Ra was out of print. I find that the theme of Razzia, is far easier to convey to people than the theme of Ra. If youre a Mafia boss and you've got the most Bodyguards, Thieves and Gold etc. then you get more points, that makes sense doesn't it. If you have got a fleet of cars but no drivers then of course they're worthless, and a police raid ends the round!

Great pocketable version of RA. Play it in a pub, play it in the airport.  Scales from 2 to 5 perfectly.  But, without the disasters, and lacking the panoramic history of ancient Egypt ([i]yes[/i], RA is thematic), and with goofy art instead of elegant art, it rates lower for me.

Although I don't like auction games, this is very quick and fluent. Its mechanics are rather cold, as in all Knizia games, but work very well (as in all Knizia games).I don't know Ra so I just comment this one: I don't feel the lack of negative cards at all and I have quite some doubts about the relatively complex scoring system. It's not to say that it is complex, actually, but I think that a easier scoring system would not take away anything of the overall strategy (for example every color has one score, that's all... without cars and cars drivers and other elements that don't appear to add a lot to the game).Anyway the game is much quicker to understand that to explain and this is definitely a good point.There's a lot of luck but there's a general feeling that players with experience will win over lucky unexperienced games, by controlling checks and auctions in a smarter way.Some other doubts about the theme, that is quite not very interesting and not developed in a very funny way.At the end, it looks like a nice filler with a good depth and a small box that is easily portable in sunday walks out of town.

I haven't had the pleasure of playing Ra yet, and I'm sure if I ever do, my score for this might go down, but until then, I have to admit I really enjoy this, and my group is obsessed.

I prefer this to Ra for several reasons: less cards means less playing time (though evaluating such a diverse distribution is still a problem), small and portable, and the theme is ideal. One major noticeable difference is with no disasters makes the game feel less chaotic and less punishing (though does reduce the tension and fun); either I'm been getting used to Ra or with nothing negative to stop you turning cards, I've noticed the tactical play of cheque values.

pretty fun game. not sure the description of this game as ra light are that accurate. the only thing that is missing from this game that is in ra are the disaster tiles. in my mind, i think that exclusion might actually make razzia, a little less random than ra, because your never going to bid on something that has the potential to screw you, just because of a tile draw. resources also seem tighter in this game, but off the top of my head i don't know enough about the tile/card counts in either game to make a valid comparison in that regard. i will say that ra is somehow more fun than this game. i'm not sure why, though. maybe pulling a tile is more fun than flipping a card over? maybe chanting ra instead of razzia sounds better. i don't know. i will say the theme here makes much more sense than it does in ra. also, the portability of this game is a plus, but you will need a decent sized playing surface to lay things out once you start playing, but no more than your average boardgame.

RATING: 7.25
Re-themed Ra, but in a slightly lighter, cheaper quality, and more portable format.  The theme works okay, but calling an auction lacks the authority of invoking Ra.  The changes from Ra are minor, but they subtly alter the game in a way that seems to diminish it in comparison to the original.  However, this game is far more portable and better suited for public places and travel.  The cards make the setup quicker, but require substantial shuffling to avoid stacking.

It was a blast for me after the first few games, but until then it lost its initial appeal. That doesn't mean, I don't like it: it's a superb game with the purest form of auction, and set-collection. Still in my top-ten.

Feb. 2014: Only learned about this one a week or so ago when it dropped in price to 99 cents on the iPad.  Then I got a chance to play the "real" version this weekend at PrezCon and I really like it a lot.  I miss the disasters from Ra, but it plays faster and I think the theme is a very cool one.  Tiles are nice in Ra, but he cards are small and fine and they are definitely faster.

It's travel Ra, but I prefer the Ra theme and calamity tiles. Without the calamity tiles the information is a little too perfect, too many holdings are taken for granted and too many calculations made.

A Ra másolata, kártyajátékban. Annyi a különbség, hogy nincsenek benne a katasztrófa elemek és más a témája, illetve, hogy nem véletlenszerűen húzunk egy zsákból, hanem az összekevert pakli tetejéről húzunk, amit végülis bármely játékos megtehet, így ennek izgalma is elveszik. A kártyák szépek, de nagyon kicsik, így egyedüli előnye a Rával szemben, a könnyebb hordozhatóság, minden másban nálam a Rá a jobb. Az értékelés a Ra 8-asából 1 mínusz a másolásáért és 1 mínusz a katasztrófa elem hiánya és a húzás miatt.

RATING: 9
Highly similar to Ra, one of my top five games, with the main differences being the absence of disaster cards. Of course, the components are far less sturdy compared to Ra.  I think the presentation and theme makes it easier to learn-somehow the multiple scoring possibilities don't seem as intimidating to newcomers here.  If I had to choose between the two, I would select Ra because the disaster tiles seem to add a little more depth, but it's still a great game and works better as an introduction to the Ra system.  My one concern is keeping the small cards in good condition.  One interesting side note:  I taught my five and eight year-olds to play with pretty good success.  I think the reason is that all cards in both games are open, so you don't have to uncover information that is supposed to be hidden when helping them out, which differs from many other games, especially card games.

[Amigo Spiele edition] {Mafia; auction, set-collection} Razzia! is a decent game. It is the card game version of Ra with fewer cards and without disaster cards. Therefore, it's faster and the decisions are less difficult than RA. The mafia theme works much better than the Egyptian theme.

All auction games share the same problem - it's hard to find suitable group of players. Non-gamers usually don't have the concept about money management. Therefore, they are often out of the game early and don't know what to do and feel bored. This situation is even worse in Razzia!/RA because a player has too many agonizing decisions. It is not recommended to non-gamers.

This game is one of my best games. I didn't like auction games but this mechanics is really amazing. It is a fully open bidding mechanics. You always have to evaluate the value of the drawn cards. You always have to take the decision whether to take the cards or to wait for a better opportunity. Your decisions influence your final score extremly so there is a lot of risc taking involved in the game.

I like this game a lot and I think it is better then the original RA, which is the same game as a boardgame but with a different theme. In my oppinion the maffia theme suits better for this game.

It definitly proved to be worth buying.

Interesting game.  I like auction games.  This game is rated lower than RA mainly because it doesn't include any type of "destruction" cards for your sets.  As a minor point, there is no score keeping mechanism so you have to have pen & paper available.The only advantage this game has over RA is smaller size - card game versus board game.
Lowering ranking again since I'm really missing the devastation tiles!

"Ra lite" pretty much describes it.  The disaster tiles have been removed, and the card distribution lessened, so it plays more quickly, and doesn't have quite as much risk involved with pushing your luck.  As such, it makes for a more family-friendly game.  The cards are awfully tiny, and the game needs some after-market fiddling to make it easier to follow (I added a "Ra token," as well as a scoreboard and individual player pieces to keep track of everything), but this isn't a bad substitution for Ra.

Ra light.  I would have prefered RA: The Card Game with an Egyptian theme to the Mafia but oh well.

Smaller version of Ra with a completely different theme (which also works). Instead of chanting Ra Ra Ra we now chant Police Police Police lol

A remake of Razzia without catastrophes and a complete retheme.
This is better for portability and maybe the theme is better suited to the mechanic.
But the pleasure of Ra is probably higher when you dig in the big tiles sack and you place your big suns as an offer... hard choice, both are of course very good games!

Better than Modern Art - though the game is good only because of the risk of getting the final raid card before investing in the goodies.. It's fast, and fun for two or more players. Theme is quite nice. Pieces are too dinky; cards are very small.

Prefer Ra: The Dice Game to this card-based version.

Great gateway. 
Important is to shuffle the cards in a proper way!

A good and portable alternative to RA. Although there's a number of things that make it inferior. 1) No Ra(zzia)figure..sometimes there's some confusion as to who's called Razzia. 2) No point chips..So you have to use an alternative or pen and paper, and if you want to keep your points secret, several bits of paper. and finally 3) no disaster cards. But apart from all this, it's still a great auction game.

Was worth a purchase during the ten-month timespan when the original wasn't in print.  Completely pointless now.

Played once, but now I would rather play Ra. The removal of the disaster tiles doesn't really help the game - and the components of Ra look better.

quick filler, still when I have the option, I'd rather play Poison or Hill 218 when only with 2.

Each player starts with a certain number of checks at the beginning and must choose carefully when to bid for the booty cards on offer. Surprisingly fun game and even though the score looks bad after the first one or two rounds it can change quickly!

RATING: 10
All the good things of Ra with quicker setup and faster gameplay.  The only reason I can see for owning Ra instead is because it looks good on the shelf.

It's a lot like Ra... And that's not necessarily a good thing. The cards take up a heckuva lot of space, since they need to be clearly spread out so everyone can see what everyone else has at any given time. Feels like a lot of decisions are beyond your control, and a great deal of the game passes with very few interesting decisions. Far, far more luck than I was expecting. I'd play it again, but only if everyone absolutely had to play it.

[UPDATE] Dropped yet another point. More plays just reveals more of what I don't like -- too many times you don't have a decision, instead the game decides for you. Turn 1 -- I'll take a hit instead of call an auction. Oh, Razzia was drawn... looks like there will be an auction anyway. So glad I made that decision. Turn 2 -- Oh look, another Razzia card. Turn 3 -- Oh look, another Razzia card. Turn 4 -- Oh look, another Razzia card. Where is my decision making again? Oh, and if you're behind in scoring after round 2, how on earth do you make up ground on someone?

Not nearly as good as Ra, don't know why.  It's essentially the same game, right?  Though it *is* shorter, and there are no catastrophe tiles (which removes some of the tension).  Just doesn't seem to stack up to Ra, at least for me.

Buen juego de subastas. Adaptación barata y portátil del Ra, con componentes menos vistosos, pero no dejan de ser cartas bonitas.

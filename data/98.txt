RATING: 8
Original. It has more than its fair share of problems (sides aren't balanced, units aren't balanced, tech isn't balanced, map isn't balanced...), but it has the best combat system of any game I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very long, deeply influenced by luck, unbalanced and with a partially scripted nature that makes some initial moves almost mandatory. Nevertheless, it’s difficult for me to rate this game less than 6, because we always enjoyed it and it’s one of the titles that brought me into boardgaming. On the plus side it offers a fascinating theme, good variety of units and a range of little rules that help in differentiating your forces and - to some extent - your strategies, not to mention the team play among each of the two factions. Recently I bought the revised edition and I’m quite eager to try it, even if the time requirement is conspicuous. 

GM version. Nice components, always a great sight on the table.

Turns between each player took forever. The rating might be better after 2-3 plays more I guess. One guy was bored and left after about 40 minutes (turns between each player was very long, to me it felt like at least 30 minutes before I could play).

The classic big-box edition, I've had since I was about 12.  I don't know that we played it at all correctly, but I remember having lots of fun with this one.

RATING: 6
Interesting game of world domination during WW2 that is 1 or 2 step higher in complexity than a Risk game...

-1 For taking too long to prepare a game (+1 hour!)...
-2 Because you can usually know the winner after the first 2-5 turns. Playing after that is usually pointless...
-1 For predictability. Everything depend on Russia. Russia survives = Axis lose. Russia dies = Axis wins...

RATING: 6
I have mixed views on Axis & Allies.  On one hand, it's an above average war game with balanced game play, and in spite of the dice-rolling mechanics, skill normally wins out over luck.  On the other hand, it's just a big pain in the butt to set-up.  By the time you spend 30 minutes setting up the board, you're ready to be done with it. 

This is a game that actually works better on the PC.  There's an older version of it that's great, but probably difficult to obtain these days.  But once you eliminate the annoying set-up and you don't have to keep track of tiny little pieces everywhere, it works a lot better. 

Board game version probably deserves a "6" or so.  The old PC version probably deserves an "8".  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
Was my first real WWII game. It's fun, but usually takes way too long to end. It really drags on if the allies start to win. Has really cool bits. It was my gateway to more complex games. Never feel like playing it, because I have other war games I enjoy more.

Also, heavy bombers are a bit broken. It's totally random if you get them or not, and they are just [i]so[/i] good, they usually decide the game.

This is too long for my tastes.  If you can spread the turns over weeks, it makes it more palatable and more interesting, in my opinion.  (We set it up at work in an empty cube, and each nation got 1-2 turns a day.  It was a blast!)

A 6 may be me being a tad nice.  A&A is a great gateway game.  It was one of the first... serious doesn't seem the right word, but it's close... games that I ever played.  It's what turned me on to other better games.  Not something I'd get excited about playing, but I would be happy to play with people new to gaming.

Quintessential Ameritrash, but one of my favorite games in high school.  Rarely makes it to the table now because of its 3-4 hour playtime and the fact that there are better strategic games in my collection.

Starting positions of the players strongly dictates the best moves to make--had to start playing the variant where Russia did not act first on the first round because it was too easy to cripple Germany in the opening move.

Good war game with nice figures and rules deep enough for avid war gamers.
On the low side, the gameplay is way too scripted and a typical game can last over 10 hours, although it is usually clear who is going to win within the first two hours of play.

Still, this game introduced me in the real wargaming world so I have to give it some credit for it.

I played this back in the 1980s and it did not do a great deal for me.  I was more into Avalon Hill and wanted more.  The strategies were odd and ahistorical, but it had some interesting ideas.
Now that I'm older, I realize it wasn't trying to be a historical game and it served a great role at being a gateway game into wargaming.  I hear some of the follow-ups are better at capturing the history and I can appreciate it more than I did then, but I think I would rather play the faster, simpler 1941 variant, because I want a shorter game.

I feel that AnA series are the most basic wargame that could ever be designed. All the various varient are but changes to geographics and additional dice rolled.

The number of areas too add to the length of the game that besides prolonging the game, does minimally changing the outcome of the game as a whole.

A good intro to wargmers wanna-be.

Plays from 1985-1992 to numerous to count.  Good WWII theme.  Very 'dicey' easy to play game which can be a bit too long.  Some players are prone to analysis paralysis.  The components are excellent.  Rulebook is clear and has many examples.

Easy to play but a-historical. It should be played with five, but the down-time is interminable. If only Larry Harris had added some sort of supply mechanic...

The newer versions improve greatly on various points and make for a much better game, but Axis & Allies will never be historical and forever remain a great Ameritrash game -- which is all we can ask for.

"Americans play to win all the time. I wouldn't give a hoot in hell for a man who lost and laughed. That's why Americans have never lost and will never lose a war. . .because the very thought of losing. . .is hateful to Americans." 

This is the pinnacle of all strategy games that want to balance complexity with playability.  In High School our games were the culmination of week's worth of planning as each side strategized their path to victory. We were so obessed we even developed and signed in ink, non-agression pacts (sometimes secretly) between various provinces.  

Axis & Allies made us fall in love with board games all over again. Can't wait to play "Spring 1942, The World is at War!" Hopefully Subs can no longer shoot at Hellcats.  :)

One of my all time favorite games, however it's been around so long and has a few basic "necessity" moves that limit gameplay. If a person knows the first few necessary moves, they can almost always beat the newcomer with ease. The revised version of the game fixed these problems.

RATING: N/A
Axis & Allies is a game for 2 to 5 players. It's the spring of 1942. The world is at war. Five world powers are struggling for supremacy. You and your opponents control the military and economic destiny of one or more of these countries. The Axis powers are Germany and Japan. Challenging their expansionism are the Allied powers of the United Kingdom, the U.S.S.R and the United States. You must work as a team with the country or countries in your alliance. Decide where to strike, when to strike and the intensity of the strike. Will it be a strategic bombing raid, a sneak submarine attack, hit-and-run assault by your well-trained infantry or a major invasion by land, sea and air forces. Economics play in important part.

Expected playing time is 3 - 4 hours.

RATING: 6
A staple of my childhood. I must admit that the game has several flaws. Some are present in all A&A games: the setup is quite tedious (obviously not an issue in any online version), and one tends to see the same strategies repeated over and over. The luck element is quite large. I also don't love the game's snowball mechanic--once one side is up in both economy and military, the game is pretty much over.

This original edition has further issues of balance. The Allies have a huge advantage (the Axis need at least 20 IPCs worth of troops to draw even), and infantry are also far more cost effective than any other piece. Any World War II game is less fun when tanks are just not worth buying.

With all that said, this is a fun World War II game. It is great fun to make grand strategic decisions about where to invade as Japan, or to play the Allies and try hang on to the crumbling British and Russian empires long enough so that the Americans can save the day. However, I would definitely buy one of the many superior modern versions of this game, not this original.

This is THE classic commercial wargame for me.  Replay value is limited to a few times with the same group of friends though, which is a shame.  Then the pattern becomes the same.  Japan always invades China.  The US swings its fleet to the Atlantic to build up for D-day.  Russia defends.  Britain waits for two turns to build a fleet across the channel, popping a carrier and 2 transports on turn two, and Germany slowly rumbles its infantry into Russia t deal the final blow to victory.

Got this from my dad when i was 10 years old. The size of the box and the miniatures inside got me intrigued but sadly with noone to play with the game stayed on my shelf year after year. Now I don't think it will ever hit the table, too many new shiny games in the way.

I finally got a chance to play this in a five player game.  Really enjoyed the play, but afraid that it would get 'samie' fairly quickly.  I've played Anniversary and Global, and though they offer more variety, they play a lot slower.

Have Middle East Variant & World at War variant.  Will most likely never play them.

RATING: 4
Let's see: Unbalanced in favor of the allies. Takes a lot of time setting-up the gameboard and then the amount of luck (dice-rolling) in this game is more insane than  with risk (less playing pieces means no averaging out)
4/10 mainly because it looks nice.

The game that got me started.  I must admit that my tastes have changed a bit (I'm more interested in tacitcal-level wargaming) since I began playing Axis, so this may be reflected in the somewhat low rating.  I'm also not as satisfied these days with games relying heavily on probability (particularly at the operational level)and less on player skill.

The game has a great premise, and the first time I saw it I became enthralled to it&#039;s great mechanics. It has, however, two major drawbacks: you need 5 people to play it well (and the 5 of them need to have 10-12 continual hours of free time, which is in itself very hard), and the game itself doesn&#039;t vary a lot from game to game.

Played it in the mid 80's in high school and had great fun. In university, I seemed to be the only one who wanted to play it. Now this game is a real dud, even to me a WW2 history buff; the never-ending dice rolling which barely influences the predictable Allied victory has become a major turn-off. What is more, because downtime is so long, many players just loose interest and the game must be aborted, hence I have never been able to complete a game to its end in years: I finally sold my copy.

Played this many, many times in the 1980s.  Came to realize that the optimal number of players is 2 or 3.  With 4 or 5 there is way too much down time, especially if you end up with Russia.  I've come to appreciate games such as History of the World where there is still a little bit of the same feel, but elimination is not on the table, and everyone can still participate throughout.  Still enjoy playing A&A and its variants occasionally, but since I've participated in so many sessions in the past and have pretty set strategic patterns for either side, I prefer to play games where I'm still developing strategies.  Will always pick up copies I find at thrift stores or garage sales to share with my gaming friends.

RATING: 6
This isn't too bad of a game.  I'll play it if I'm in the mood for it, and we have a solid block of time to get the game in.  Playing it with 5 players seems to be best, so that nobody has to do double-duty on the factions.  I'd imagine playing it with 5 other folks who are very familiar with it would be the best scenario, as that would probably significantly lower the playing time.

The game is slightly more complex/interesting than Risk, although I think it loses some of the excitement, but that's a fair trade-off, I'd say.  I like the map of the new AH edition, as it's less bright and garish than the original one, and just "feels" more modern somehow.

The print on the player aids for each faction is super-tiny, though.  They could have made it a bit bigger and still have fit everything on it, I'd say.  I also like how they got rid of the 'blow-up' sections around the rim of the map in favor of having a little numbered platform that can be used off-board, with a corresponding token to place on the map.  Cool idea that allows the map to have slightly bigger countries on it.

Taking down half the opponent's attacking aircraft with a salvo of anti-aircraft was/is/and will always be sweet.

I have owned this game for a long time, but it mostly sits on my shelf.  I have only played it a few times as it does take a significant time to complete.

I played this for the first time last night with some buddies from work.  Hard to believe I'd never played it before but it was enjoyable.  As a newbie, it was recommended I play the USSR, as that country tends to operate on a more limited scale, plus you have Britain and the US to (hopefully) kind of back you up.  All things considered, I held my own, although the putative winner ended up being Japan!  We played off and on for nearly seven hours (taking a break to eat dinner) and they told me it was normal for a full session to take as much as nine hours!  This could be considered a rather long time for something mostly considered a "beer and pretzels," mainstream/relatively easy war game.  I don't know if an abbreviated version exists (I didn't look at the rule book; the guys taught me as I went along) but this might be something to take into consideration for anyone on the fence.  All in all, I'd like to play again soon and may even pick up my own copy.

This game used to be one of my favorites, but has balance issues.  Every game plays out pretty much the same once you get into it.  Most games last 4 hours give or take.

Axis and Allies suffers from experienced player syndrome.  Any mildy experienced Allied players will NEVER loose.  Throwing in the variant rules and some home rules helps.

The classic war game.  I can't really think of much bad to say about it.  Some minor balance issues hamper play.  But for now, nice medium weight war game, made much better by the fact that you play in teams.  Alas, does not hit the table with my group that often.  Also runs into the issue that the game is usually "over" well before the actual win conditions are met.

I've always been luke warm on this game.  I get the love for many, but I just don't have it.  It seems like the payoff isn't enough for such a long game.  I think the best part of the game is the teams' ability to consult, anticipate, and then feel the success or failure of your plan.

When I first joined BGG I rated this game a 9. I guess I was basing that on nostalgia. After playing the Anniversary Edition with my buddy (we used to play the original all the time in high school), and being exposed to so many other great games, I've had to seriously reevaluate my rating of this game.

I still love the game, but I probably won't play it much anymore (if ever).

If you have the time to research the variants, rules clarifications and find a steady group of players, this can be a decent wargame. I&#039;ve played with random maps and more house rules than I can count...the system lends itself well to this sort of thing. With an extra few sets of pieces it even scales well enough.

Too much of the game hinges on two early battles: Germany invading Russia and Japan defeating the US fleet.

Otherwise the rules are only one step up in complexity from Risk: battle between huge stacks of units and endless rolls with six-sided dice.

A classic war themed board game. This was the first board game of this type that I ever played, yes even before Risk. For the amount of time spent, considering what you get out of it, I think I'd be better off playing another war game. However, if you want to get a fix of WW2 strategic gameplay, and you don't want to deal with counter or block games that take 10+ hours to play then this is for you. The fact that up to 5 people can play together with most copies of the game is a big plus.

Great strategy game that is relatively simple to play.  EG. Doesn't take forever...UNLESS you have an ultra slow player at which time you might as well go for dinner between turns.  The strategies are all known and players who have played lots or studied will win regardless...more interested in the new version to see how this has been accounted for...

Played this many many times in the 80's but there is a definite 'script' problem - Allies win if Germany is crushed before Russia falls, Axis win if Russia goes down first. Which makes playing some nations rather boring (Russia = build infantry, beg for fighters from US/UK and hope to hold off Germany/Japan until the US arrive in force) ...

The Godfather of boardgames.  This one did it all just right.  From the pieces to the the game board this one was one of the best quality games ever produced!  Lots of gaming value out of this one.  Sure, there was a lot of luck involved, but that's part of the reason we play games.  Many fond memories of this one. If I could justify the investment, I'd consider the new Anniversary edition, but this one still holds it own.

Ah, axis and allies.  Classic.  I love the fact that unlike risk, each unit is weighted differently in either attack or defense.  The game is a fierce balance between aggression on the battlefield and funds conservation, making full use of your military.
  The game is pretty intense, but if you love war games, you'll probably love this!!

I have to admit I haven't played this game in years. I remember thinking back in the day that it was like a more complicated version of Risk, but that was probably 13-14 years ago, so I don't know how valid that assessment is. The game has been sitting on my shelf for a very long time.

RATING: 4.5
One of the first board games I ever played. That means I have a soft spot for it, but honesty compels me to admit that this is a rather flawed game. The main upside of this game is that moving planes and tanks around a map is really fun. That's not nothing, but then there are a lot of games that can deliver that.

The main problems are fourfold. First, the setup required for Axis and Allies is very time consuming. Second, because the starting positions are entirely predetermined, the games tend to unfold in pretty similar ways each time. Unless the Allies feel like playing sub-optimally, they basically want to do a pretty similar strategy (kill Germany first) every time. Third, the game has an unfortunate snowball mechanic, since conquering territories gets you more resources which lets you conquer even more territories, and so forth. Once one side gets a lead, things tend to end quickly rather than swing back and forth. And fourth, certain territories (especially the UK, Japan, and Germany) are not big enough to hold all different units on them. Things get pretty cluttered. 

The above issues are present in every version of Axis and Allies. This original version adds a few idiosyncratic gameplay problems. The Eastern Front between Germany and Russia is a total mess in this game. It will almost always devolve into a giant German stack in Eastern Europe against a giant Russian stack in Karelia. This stalemate usually continues until Japan reaches Moscow or America reaches Berlin (more often the latter.) Also, the costs of certain units are just not balanced. Infantry are too strong for their price, while battleships are so overcosted that no sane player would ever buy one. (Subsequent versions of the game don't have these problems.) The game is also *very* strongly tilted in favor of the Allies, though that can be fixed via bidding and house rules (I strongly recommend forbidding a Russian attack on Turn 1, for example.)

Also, don't expect historical accuracy here. The Axis are given far greater military and industrial power than they ever really had. E.g., Japan starts the game with about seventy percent of the United States's industrial capacity. Five to ten percent would have been closer to reality. Of course, I don't fault the game designers for this; historically, the Axis had zero chance of winning the war in Spring 1942, so giving them a bunch of ahistorical advantages is necessary. That's all fine--just don't learn your history from this game!

Played this game probably every second weekend throughout high school. Great, great game although once you've played it that much most of the strategies are set: it comes down to dice rolls. Still, this is the game that got me back into boardgaming: the first one I played since Monopoly et al, when I was a kid.

Owned it but then had to leave it behind one year after I was moving back home from being overseas.

It's long and intense and I played it waaaaay to much one summer. I enjoyed it, but got frustrated by the dice much to often. It's pretty much a cooler version of risk with set starting places. It's best played over a long period of time; Set it up on a table some where and go watch a movie while your opponent strategizes, then come back to roll it out. Beware! this game fried my brain from excessive game play/over strategizing.

When I was first introduced to this game by my cousin, I didn't want to play anything else.  It was the first game of any real substance that I ever played other than chess.  Comes with lots of little planes, tanks, men, and boats.  I love board game bits.  Played it like crazy the first year I owned it.  

A&A has superficial resemblance to [i]Risk[/i].  Each player commands an army and the outcomes of battles are determined by dice rolls.  But there are many types of units with varying "hit" values, and the ownership of the territories determines your income with which you purchase your army units.  There are also technologies that you can acquire to improve your capabilities.

I love A&A but it's a little time consuming.  Games usually take 3-4 hours to play, and so I haven't played it for years now.

An ok strategy and war game with a rather dense rule set which makes it much more complex than a game like Risk, but much less complex than a true wargame.

Overall, it's actually pretty cool as it injects a bit of economy into the war game system.  However, there is so much downtime that I usually get bored very quickly, and I'm just not into these types of global battle games.  You'd be hard pressed to get me to play this.

I knew what I was getting into way back when, but it was the only thing people were willing to play.  Spent most of my gaming hours here, and tried to make the best of it.  About the best thing I can say is that some "serious" wargamers should make the effort to look past the fact that some games use plastic miniatures instead of counters.  Plastic mini's do not necessarily equal a bad or shallow game (necessarily).

Seems to me one of those oldies which aren't goldies. I think its popularity is mostly due to the theme. Many people wanting a light WWII grand strategy game. As a game as such, it's nothing special.

A step up from Risk for sure! I might actually upgrade the rating if I played it more; but I just had this marathon session years ago with my brother in which he had MAJOR analysis paralysis which kind of ruined the game for me forever… Nevertheless, I’m not a big fan of war games, so would prefer to play something else. So while I can appreciate the step up from Risk, it's just too long of a game for me.

I played Axis and Allies all throughout high school and college.  I haven't really played it since.  After playing a couple of dozen times you realize that the opening moves are pretty scripted and depending on how the dice roll you figure out your strategy going forward.  So the first hour or so is pretty much the same every game.

I'd be interested to try some of the newer versions that have been produced that focus on particular parts of the war and possibly fix some of the out dated mechanics.

RATING: 7
One of my classic all-time favorites from when I was significantly younger.  My version is Copyrighted 1986, and it definitely brings back memories of me as a 15 year-old splitting time between a game of A&A, fighting zits, and digging chicks!

Overall, an excellent wargame that I will need to bring to the table once again - although right now, my heart is set on Tide of Iron.

EDIT - 08/01/10:  Within the next two weeks, this game will hit the table for the first time in nearly 15 years, and I am actually looking forward to it.  Problem is, my opponent will be one of my friends who is not only a history buff, but also a military technician - I think only the dice rolls may save me.

Good game, though a little too complicated for casual play (and setup is a real time consuming pain).  Also, I've found you can't do a whole lot playing as some of the powers (namely, Germany or Russia).  It is amusing, though, when odd, ahistorical outcomes occur -- like the Japanese player conquering portions of mainland America.  Offers more complexity than most mainstream games.

I think the time when I'd enjoy playing this much has passed.  I'd probably only indulge in a game as a way to entice a new gamer into some more of MY games.

I will give Axis and Allies credit for being better than Risk.

I originally came to Axis & Allies as an experienced Risk player, and I assumed that A&A was simply a slightly more in-depth Risk styled game...which is very much the case.

A&A has a great historical feel, and decent components. The rules are fairly in-depth, but I wouldn't feel uncomfortable explaining this to people who are used to playing standard fare American games either.

This said, the board, though large, is much too small in many areas for the amount of troops that build up, especially around Germany, and I echo earlier sentiments that a larger board should be at least made available.

The pre-determined stance and strategy of your country can also take away from the game, with the first few moves being almost necessary to avoid having Germany start rolling through the mainland.

Initially, I thought the game was going to be better than Risk for the increased depth, but the more I played it the more I realised that the game, while adding new dimensions, is actually less fun than Risk because of the straight-jacket that seems to be put on you in terms of viable strategy as there's very little room for new wrinkles in the basic game play.

The game is also long, even by American standards. Explaining the game to casual gamers will be decently easy, keeping them at the table for 5 hours plus is not. And though it'd be easy to get experienced gamers to sit down for that long, why would you want to when other, more in-depth and less luck based games are available?

If you're looking to kill a day then I'd suggest looking elsewhere.

WAY overrated.  Of course, when it was released (the MB Gamemaster version), it was hot bananas and I loved having a game with scads of little tanks and planes.

But still, I respect it and have fond memories of it nonetheless.

Alright, what can I say. I like this game. My only problem is that it should only be billed as a 4 player or 2 player game. Russia has a set of moves that must be followed if it is going to last the first 2 rounds.

Lots of great bits.

Dropped my rating because the revised version (2004) is so much better!

Not so good game: serious downtime issues in a 3-5 player game. Also, the map and determined setup of the units in the beginning of the game greatly reduces replayability. Most games are decided on the Russian-German front. It may sound historic but, believe me, it is not fun. You do not have much choice either as Germany or Russia: in either case you are trying to control one strategic province: Karelia. Success and failure of this venture depends mostly on dice. The game also has several unit and technology balance issues. Quite good looking components, though.

A formative wargame. I spent many weekends as a kid playing game after game, trying to nail the optimal strategy for each country. Eventually, it became clear that the best strategies were: 
1. Russia makes tons of infantry and plays a stubborn defensive plan, patiently breaking wave after wave of German and Japanese tanks to exhaust their resources and wait for the US to arrive.  
2. Germany makes tank after tank, takes Africa ASAP, and tries to get to Russia before it has too much infantry. It also builds subs to try and block the US and prevent an invasion via Italy. If Germany takes over Russia the game is effectively over. 
3. Japan makes a sub fleet to own the Pacific and builds a factory on the mainland, evetually owning everything that is not Russia. If Japan owns the ocean and lands in Alaska the game is likely an Axis win. However, if Germany folds, Japan won't last long.  
4. Britain makes bomber after bomber and industrial bombs Germany incessantly. Once Germany can't produce more than a tank or two, Britain switches to helping protect the US invasion forces with fighters out of Gibraltar.  
5. US makes transports and tanks/infantry to take Africa back and invade via Italy. Also makes bombers to help industrial bomb Germany. If the US holds Italy, the game will end once the US starts making tanks on the continent.

My uncle gave me the game about 20-25 years ago. Used to play a lot with my friends on the weekends. Takes a while to setup, but is a lot of strategic fun once you get going. The dice aspect of combat can be awful cruel at times, having a larger attacking force wiped out by some lucky rolls. The Heavy Bombers research was also pretty overpowered.
Overall, fun, but with a few problems.

Risk-modeled conflict game set in WWII with various unit types and technology, and lots of land options and production features. This classic game superbly simulates the events of the actual history based on initial setup of units, but is, for that matter, also somewhat rather deterministic. Multiple unit types makes for interesting improvements over the simple 50/50 odds of Risk. Nice combat dice rolling system that makes conflict rather enjoyable. Technology adds depth to decision-making options and customizes each faction's role and capabilities, but is difficult to effectively pursue while fighting and funding a war. Fully engrossing conflict game demanding a great amount of strategic decisions and moderate amount of luck that lasts an afternoon or evening.

I love playing the game, it just take a LONG time to get through from beginning to end.  All about WWII.  I really like how Russia starts out strong, but without a lot of income, declines in power quickly as well.  And Japan slowly gains it's power - very much like how it was during the war.  And the miniatures and fun to play with as well.  I'll buy an aircraft carrier merely to fly the fighters on and off of it. :)

Part of the MB Gamemaster Series.  I own 2 copies.  I bought my first copy for myself for Christmas around 1995.  I had first encountered it at Annie's sister's place in New Brunswick, and looked through the rule book while we stayed there.  That hooked me on it.  I played several games against the computer, and even online against a single opponent.  The computer was easy to beat, and it was difficult finding a good opponent to play against regularly.
Then I found a second copy at a garage sale along with 2 other MG Gamemaster Series games, Shogun, and Fortress America, around the year 2000.  I paid $4 for each game.  That was my best garage sale find of the year.
In my opinion, the game can be won or lost on Britain's first play, depending on the outcome against Germany.

I have played A&A since my college days.  I found it really cool that many of the house rules and modifications to the map and units that my friends and I made in the 90's became part of the anniverary edition. I rate the game only a 6 because I have the worst dice rolling luck on earth, and it has ruined many a good games of A&A

I have the second edition (I think): well, I purchased it in the early 90's. I don't have the new version, and I'm not interested in buying it.  A&A takes too long to complete, and gets bogged down.  I prefer A&A Europe or A&A Pacific.

Nice components, easy to understand rules, dice rolling fest.  However, my 7 year old son is starting to learn the history of World War II with great interest while playing this game.  
I suggested that he purchase bombers with the UK and he was very skeptical, until he rolled two 5s with his bombers and Germany handed over 10 IPCs.  Now he is investing heavily in bombers!

It is the gateway game so it can't be criticised too harshly, but once you play better designed games, you realise how broken the rules are.  Nonetheless the plastics pieces and theme make it comparatively easy to entice non-gamers.
Last time I played (my cousin) I left him my copy for his birthday.  Maybe next time I see him he'll want to play something better.

A game I grew up on. To bad my bonehead brother got a hold of my copy while I was in college and glued all the pieces together with super glue into 5 inch long supAr bombers. Knucklehead. The game play was an awesome step up from the infuriating nature of Risk, but easy enough for an early teenager. However, as you start to master the game, the more you begin to realize that there are certain canned strategies that become required play routines. Setup was a bitch. Especially if that game at any one time was more then 15 degrees from level. All the damn pieces will spew out of the styrofoam trays.

Components are great. Furthermore, this is the game that got me into serious gaming. Played a lot in the "old days".

It's too long for what it tries to be: a simplistic game about WW2. Unrealistic things tend to happen, like conquering africa with a single armored unit. To make matters worse: very often the game is decided in the dice-loaded battle for Russia.

RATING: 9
A very well balanced linear strategy game that has stood the test of time.  The downsides to this game is how heavily dependant it is on dice, and how hard it is to calculate the probability of victory in a combat situation.  Unlike Risk (which is very intuitive), it is quite difficult to tell which side is likely to win a fight.

The game that got me back into wargaming after a lengthy hiatus. Much fun. Enjoyed the strategic/economic decision making aspects. After many plays, began to become somewhat scripted. New revised (2004) edition has absolutely reinvigorated this design - see my comments under that entry. 

Beyond the plays I've logged here at BGG, I estimate I've played this ~10 times prior to my logging of plays.

Rated as my 17 year old self would have rated it. Classic, simple, fun, dice-heavy WWII game that accomplishes exactly what it set out to do. Played many times. Probably a good introduction to wargames for kids who want to graduate past Risk.

Update: I've tried the 2nd edition (or 25th anniversery edition, or whatever they're calling it), and it's not bad but trying to turn a beer & pretzels WWII strategy game into something more "realistic" defeats the original appeal of the game.

My dad has been consistently winning the Michcon Axis & Allies tournament for years now, and I learned from him. While the game can become a mosh-pit of repetetive die rolling in some cases, in the end a solid strategy and good teamwork will win it every time. Realisticly though, a serious game should involve only two players, and a seaoned allied player will beat the axis damn near every time.

Still, lots of fun, if a bit long.

I´m not so much into wargames that include dice since I have the feeling that I always have bad luck when rolling them. I really don't like to lose against opponents with five times less units just because they always seem to get the right numbers. Despite of my personal dislike of games with dices it´s still a nice game and you can have a lot of fun with it.

+ There a quiet a few tough tactical decisions.
+ Different possible winning-strategies
+ Nice board and bits although the map could have been a little larger.

- A little imbalanced towards the Axxis.
- Dice-driven combat :)

One of the old games that I would put with Monopoly as things that destroy people's perceptions of games.  Tons of fiddly pieces that don't fit on the board, one scenario, extremely predictible sets of moves.  Horriblely unfun.  (I did beat Germany as Russia on turn one one game though.  If I recall, it was 7 out of 10 dice showing 1's.  Funny, but we just had to start the game over.  Another reason it sucks.)

RATING: 6
A classic.  This was my favorite war game in the mid-80s.  The allies are definitely favored.  That can be corrected, but I think the game suffers from a lack of replayability.  The game never plays to completion for the Allies.  Once the scales tip, the game is over and the Axis concede.  Japan is never taken...heh, like the real war except no nukes.

RATING: 5
There is much to like about this classic game. There are both tactical and strategic decisions to make and yet it is simple to play. Too many multiplayer wargames suffer from poorly-defined alliance problems, which A&A solved by simply mandating the alliances. The use of production and the possibility of technology improvements are great additions, which set the standard in empire games to this day. 
 
However, A&A has many issues which detract from its playability. Islands are too unreachable and difficult to take, thus  they can be nearly unassailable fortresses once defended. Boring stalemates occur after an hour or two of play, which are invariably won by lopsided Allied economic advantages. The fixed setup leads to scripted openings. 
 
Despite my gripes, I am surprisingly excited to try out the 2004 revamped re-release of A&A, which looks to have solved many of the flaws in this one.

The standard for the Ameritrash game. This was one of those games that made me go "wow" when it came out, and caused me to look at games again. I consider Axis & Allies to Ameritrash as Settlers of Catan is to the Eurogame.

I now play the revised edition ([gameid=10093] (2004)) which I also own because I like the new rules.  

I think the revised edition is better, but most of my plays and fond memories of this game were on the original version when I was younger (before BGG), so I have great memories of the original version.

So here is a mainstay of American Strategy Board Games. Axis and Allies was one of my first strategy games and although a bit heavy on luck and a bit long, is a great middle ground to some of the other War games of the 70's and 80's, not to mention it's just fun to play out WWII with the miniatures and alliances on the board.

I will say this is a game that is best with 5 seperate players. Although the time between turns gets long, it adds a dimension to the game lost when you are controlling multiple powers and forces a bit more interaction to coordinate with your fellow players.

We enjoy random power assignment since after a time I had Japan down to a science having played them over and over again, but when I was "forced" to play the UK, I was amazed how poorly I did the first time since I had never palyed them or payed much attention to them in the past.

It's just one of those games every collection should have.

I'm not a war gamer. Though, it can happen that I play a war game from time to time. Axis and Allies is an OK game. I played it a few times. Oddly enough, more time on the computer than in person.

The first few turns are basically the same in every single game. No real surprises there. What comes next is who won the battles during the first few turns.

Takes a couple of hours to play. Dice fest like Risk, but with various different units. A step up from Risk.

Got Axis and Allies in a game trade.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Axis & Allies is the best WWII game I've played.  Grand strategical play and open, tabletalking teamwork that makes it very easy to immerse yourself and have a good time.  It takes a day to play over the board, and thus a relaxed atmosphere, but damn if it's not one of the finest team games out there.

Good.  Totally blew me away when I first saw it.  Who knew that so much molded plasticy goodness was even humanly possible?  Never played it enough to ruin it, but I started to see some possibly degenerate strategies even as a young'un.  Supposedly the WOTC revision fixes a lot of balance issues, but now there's other games I'd rather play.  Sorry, A&A.

This is the game that started it all back in my high school and college days.  Unfortunately, after so many plays, the strategies for the different nations seemed to settle into set patterns.  Quite frankly, I seldom have the time to sit down for a gaming session long enough to play this anymore.  And when I do, I'd much prefer to play several shorter and better games.  But if my battered game box is any indication, I more than got my money's worth from this old war horse.  Rating is based mostly on nostalgia.

I really enjoyed all the negotiation between the teams in A&A. Back as kids when we just played the game and didn't bother to analyze the system to discover it's broken features, those were the most fun. As the Allies we'd have these long discussion/arguments over what to do to break fortress europa, meanwhile as the Axis we'd strategize on how best to make Russia implode or throw off America's momentum. Fortunately the teams never devolved into a situation where one player would dominate the decision making of the other players, and so instead wonderfully tense debates would ensue as teamates would try to figure out how best to cooperate with each other.

I'd really like to try out the latest edition of A&A. If it really has fixed the broken elements of the original game, or at least hide new ones for awhile then I'm sure I'd enjoy the game all over again.

I've tried to play twice and could never get past the first couple of turns.  Recently ran into a situation that the manual didn't cover. Wasn't having enough fun to bother making up a neutral rule.  REALLY wanted to give it a COMPLETE try.  Would be fun if I could play more effortlessly.

The board is too small for the pieces...even when counters are used.

Also, you'd think with all of the 1s and 2s I roll with Risk, I'd be great at Axis & Allies.  Instead, I roll 5s and 6s all the time.  Bollocks.

I remember playing this game with my friends in the 80's and loving it. Not sure where my original copy went, it's probably in my parents' attic. I recently bought a new copy for $35 just to have it. I read through the rules again recently but have not played it. I'm not sure I will play it again, but I'm proud to have it in my collection. Honestly I think there are many other newer and more exciting WWII strategy games out there now. I'll play this if my son notices it on the shelf and wants to try it one day.

Perhaps the best known and most played of the Milton Bradley Gamemasters series.  Scratches the itch for a world-wide World War II game that doesn't require a gaming club and three years to play.  Good players can make play tough and strategic and produce surprise wins.

RATING: 4
Comment is for original ruleset, have not played revised. The fixed starting position (and only one scenario, if more this wouldn't be a problem) gives the game a sense of monotony that grosses me out. Did enjoy it at one time, but now would take a lot of convincing to play. Decent rules, teamplay, gameboad, and components, etc. but the actual game is just too boring. 

Classic gaming moment: as Germany I took out Britain's sea power in turn one. Allies conceded the game, turn one win.

I would rate the actual game play at "7"; but the setup time is longer then most games; and the play time is longer then the rest of them.

RATING: 4
I played this a lot in high school, until I figured out a first turn kill on Britian with Germany (not possible with the re-write... i think...)  Even ignoring that, There is no reason for the Allies NOT to sit for 2-4 turns and build infantry only.  The Allies have an economic advantage on the Axis that is incredibly difficult to overcome.  That does not make for an enjoyable game, imho.

NOTE: the ORIGINAL game (pre-MB) with special powers, and unit limits was far superior.(I'd rank it higher)  Still have not played the 'new' version, and I'm not really interested in doing so.

I bought my original Axis & Allies at Toys R Us, the box art was very intriguing as was the size of the game.

The MB Gamemaster series was a favorite in high school, but Axis and Allies saw more table time simply for the lengthy set-up; it was actually played less than Conquest of the Empire or Shogun. I find it fiddly and not that engrossing--more trouble than it's worth.

Oft maligned here at the 'Geek, I find this game incredibly fun and extremely deep.

"As is", the game seems bent towards the Allied powers.  My friends and I use a rule variant by a Mark McLaughin found in an article called "1941: Axis and Allies". It originally appeared in an old "Wargamer" magazine, but I don't know what issue. It can be found here:

http://www.wargamer.com/axisandallies/original/scenarios/historical/1941/scenario_1941_wargamer_markmclaughlin.html

I've spent many an hour hunkered over this board sweating bullets, agonizing over every move.

PS the computer game's AI was a JOKE.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I consider myself "semi-retired" from this game.  If you have two equally skilled players, it becomes a race to see if Germany can take Russia before the Allies can take Germany.  They almost never do, and then it becomes a matter of whether or not Japan can liberate Germany, which they almost never do. Still, this is pretty much the game that made me a gamer (along with D&D), and I would gladly play if someone else really wanted to, but I'm more interested in Memoir '44 and Attack! now. I own several  accessories from Strafing Run Games (now defunct I believe), and they really help to spice up the game.

Ok... So there are a few flaws with MB's version of Axis & Allies but many of you have to admit that it is the game that started you on your journey into wargaming.  It is for me, and as such deserves a high honor as a gateway to deeper games.  Let's face it, the game is not an accurate representaion of warfare in the 1941 period but was it really meant to be? Here's the question that really should be pondered when considering a rating for Axis & Allies: Is it fun?  The answer: You Bet it is!

I've yet to play the latest edition of the game, so my opinion is skewed by old data.

Still, I enjoy the game when I can actually find enough people to play it.

A good wargame with simple rules that goes smoothly.

The defacto classic light War-game from every ones childhood.  The only downside (imo) is that it can easily take 6-8 hours to get through a game. And the Russian player has got it tough!  I only wish I had more time to play.  Thoroughly enjoyed the theme and the play mechanics.

The classic!  Love this game.  Only knock against it is the static setup.  Other than that, a great light wargame.  Well, the length can be killer...and damn does it suck when someone gets a lucky research role...but other than that, the GRANDPAPPY of modern AT games.

EDIT:  Time has not been kind to this one.  The length of play versus the depth of mechanics is waaaaaaaaay out of whack.  This was cool when you had multiple hours-long afternoons to kill; now I can't imagine spending a whole day on this one.  It was the grandpappy, but time to put grandpappy in the home.

RATING: 5
A&A is a game that is more an experience of 1980s gaming warfare than anything that feels like a modern take on wargames. A&A is way more fiddly than it should be, but it has a rather fluid ruleset and there are many enjoyable and tense moments, even if it's just a dice game by the end. The theme comes out quite well in some places, especially when considering where things are positioned when the game begins and the capabilities of the five powers given their starting units and geographical locations. In that, A&A is a very decent abstraction of WWII. Unfortunately, the tweezer-finger bits can cause quite a few placement and movement issues and no region is ever too large to fit all the pieces that are needed. Plus, unless you have a decent plan, the game can go on in a stalemate for quite a long time, which creates some flimsy moments.

Just recently had a game of A&A again. Long time since the game before that. We played with Xeno Games World at War expansion which alters the setup and includes several unique rules and restrictions for each of the main powers. The expansion included is certainly more interesting to play in alot of ways but... and this is a big BUT... I would suggest playing with 2 players only. The reason for that is that both Russian and ÚS actions are VERY limited in the early game and just not very fun to play the first 4-5 turns imo.

RATING: 7
[b][i]Axis & Allies[/i][/b] was my (and many) introduction to war games. Created in 1981, this is still the standard for global-scale World War 2 board games. However gameplay wise, the slow player-by-player turn sequence and simple (but still fun!) dice combat make A&A feel dated relative to more recent games. This game is nominally 5-player--and it's great if you can get a willing enthusiastic group. However, the long wait times between turns make this most easily played with 2 people.

Perhaps it's because I've had so many good times with this game, but I hope that everyone tries this game at least once. Unfortunately for my nostalgia, I think games such as Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage, War of the Ring, A Game of Thrones: The Board Game, or Warrior Knights are better games. But I [i]would[/i] recommend A&A for people interested in learning the basic flow and geography of World War 2.

A good classic strategy war game, but lacks some things like different types of units.  There are no artillery, no warship between transport and battleship.

There was a time when I'd have given this an "8" - I still remember my first game. I bought it for my best friend (hi, Tim!) as a thank-you for driving me 1/2 way across TX for a job interview. On the way back to his family home for spring break, I read the rules aloud as we drove. When we arrived, we decided we'd "just set it up." Around midnight, it was "just play the first turn." WW2 ended around 5 am the next morning. :-)

I played a number of times over the years... and while I enjoyed each game, I began to see the game fall into patterns that decreased my enjoyment. (And a 5 player game didn't help - it just made it longer.)

I'd like to try the newer versions - I'm curious if my opinion will change.

Comments on original edition:

I enjoy this game once in a blue moon.  Sure, it takes a long time to set-up.  Also, in my group at least, we all play the same strategy -- Allies focus all attacks on Germany, while Japan ignores the Pacific and expands in to Asia.  Woe to Russia and Germany, because Russia falls in a couple of turns, and then Germany bites it after a drawn-out D-Day build up.  Japan then slowly gets whittled down until we decide that 6 hours of play is enough.

Remember this being epic as a young teenager playing with family.  Haven't played since--time and set up is a huge factor--oh, that and finding others to play.

Update 5/28/2013
Have now played several games again recently, and it's proven that it deserves to be one of the classic military board games.  Still a very long game though.  

Playing it has inspired me to look into buying A&A 1942 2nd ed. for the new units and improved rules.

It is a game that I thought I have once mastered, and I was absolutely certain that the Allies had an advantage. Now that I've played it again after leaving it on the shelf for years, and played against an opponent that is good and thinks very differently from my college buddy, it is a different game!  Perhaps I'll never master it, but it is a fun game.  Would be a 8 if the game doesn't require 6 hours to play.

A game that is, in my experience, decided after the first or second turn but then drags on for hours is not a good game.  If only real *good* light wargames introduced people to the genre there'd be more respect among average people from it.  Instead we get this game--not god awful, but with all the things the average public hates about complicated games.  

In particular, the move every unit and resolve all your combats in all fronts makes turns last forever.  I also don't really like the unit elimination strategy of player always chooses.  The meatshield element that is created by this dynamic leads to an odd game element where your tanks and planes are never scratched in successful battles--the only team that loses these expensive and important units is the loser of the battle.  As a result, the attacker is left largely unscathed in the sense that his good, expensive, non-infantry units all remain.  Winning breeding winning in battle is not a game mechanic I like to see, personally.

On top of that, this is another "Germany gambles in the first two turns, then loses or wins" strategic world war 2 game.  Boring.  I like tension and push and pull all game.

Regrade September 2007

This game gets worse to me as I play better wargames with a wide variety of people.  Rating is going down pretty significantly.  I have turned down games of this many times and don't anticipate playing it again--anybody motivated enough to play a wargame of this complexity with me is going to get taught a different game that I'd much rather play if they'll agree to it.  So far, results have been quite good--the people I have taught other games to have remarked how much better they are than any  lumbering game of Axis and Allies they've played.

After fifty games there is a tendency to be very Sovieto-centric first part followed by a big battle in the Pacific ocean. A bit annoying that the units seems to be too few for the less important areas since one unit never really matters, in the pacific and in Africa there would be nice with a couple of "half a infantry". On the other side there is to many units in the Sovieto-German battles.

Although I cannot credit this game as my baptism into boardgaming, it was absolutely foundational and forming to my ever-growing love of games.

Yeah, I liked it a lot. Since then, its place in my collection is one of nostalgia now. Different gaming group, different tastes for them and for me. But this remains a special game for me.

Although it's best to approach Axis & Allies as a game (rather than a simulation), it captures the flavour of the war pretty well. It's simple enough for casual players but has plenty to explore for those with more experience. Everything more-or-less turns on the eastern front struggle between Germany and the USSR, but that's true of the war itself.

Ultimately, the game is unbalanced (in favour of the Allies) and that limits its long-term appeal. However, because there are so many strategies available to the players, you could easily play 20-25 times before settling on the "best" way to play.

I have many fond memories of all nighters drinking beer and playing this in a neighbors basement man cave. He showed me Germany can take an unprepared Allies player's Britain away in 4 moves and I showed him a determined America could take Japan away from an unsuspecting Axis player fairly early too. All in all this is a very good middle ground tactical/strategic game.

It's fun. The revised edition is a bit better. A&A is imbalanced, Allies win 80%. But there's an easy way to compensate: you bid $ for the right to play Allies, and the Axis player uses the bucks to buy a bunch of extra tanks for better blitzkrieging. Lots of other problems, such as: unit costing is wrong (ships cost too much); the later the game gets the less interesting it is. Still, it's fun, and hey, it has cool bits!

RATING: 5
Enjoyed this as a kid before I knew what the infantry push was, now not so much. There are simply too few realistic choices and once you've made one or two your course is set for the rest of the absurdly long play time. In a 5 player game, each player is really only making a decision once every 15 minutes or so. It's exciting to chew your nails over the big dice rolls but that excitement doesn't make up for the fact that there are far better games.

[2005/11/27] There was one time when I thought this was the Best Game Ever, but I don't have much interest in playing it these days.  It has a scripted feel, unless you try non-maximum, non-historic strategies to increase the fun factor (Russia building a battleship, Germany occupying Brazil, etc.).  Encourages turtling and building up defense.  At best, it's Risk with variable unit abilities and a thin WW2 veneer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You guys (and gals) know. This game is more important for its legacy than it is fun to play.  Balance issues, susceptibility to simplified tactics (tank rush), long waits between turns (with more than two players), agonizing slow grind at the end.  And yet, it remains occasionally compelling to this day.  I've never played any of the modern variants that sought to address the flaws of the original (with varying degrees of success).

Everyone's introductory WW2 wargame, it seems like. Even though it's not remotely intended to be a simulation, there's still some visceral fun in sweeping across continents with a stack of little soldiers and tanks. I'm probably influenced by nostalgia, but it ought to count for something.

I used to think this was good, but then I was spoiled by the Europe Edition. Much more tactical. When playing Germany, you are faced with some of the same strategic decisions Hitler faced. There's no reason to play WWII on a worldwide map.

When I found this game existed back in 2003 (I'm behind the times) I flipped out. I was just saying how Risk was okay but I hated how the strategy was so basic, then my friend suggested I try this because "it has planes and stuff". I love this game. I think I love it because I haven't played it a lot so I haven't discovered that there are some first-best opening moves that trump all others. That sounds annoying to me, since it takes away some strategy, but I am still blissfully ignorant when I bust it out and play (which hasn't happened in years, unfortunately). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Too long for what it is. Yes, there is a bit more to think about than with basic Risk, but 2210 would be a better choice for a next step. Or Nexus Ops. Or a lot of other stuff. This one just moves a bit too slowly for my taste. A lot of planning for not a lot of control.

 Fiddly bits, though the bits are pretty. The use of chips to eliminate the need for dozens and dozens of miniatures. Own the newer version, so heavy bombers don't kill EVERYTHING.
 I like the simple combat system and the balance to the game. It's not a hugely deep war-game, but at the same time it's a really good game because it forces a lot of decisions. I just wish ships weren't so damned expensive lol. 
   Very nicely balanced.

AA is a great war game but the pieces made the game unnecessarily confusing. The pieces are neat little plastic minitures but do not fit well on the map. I think I prefer block style war games. There are so many better wargames out there. This is too long for such a simple game.

I give it a 7 because I enjoy the game; however, it depends on the players, if no one knows how to play, it's a good game.  And if everyone knows how to play, it will be a good game.

B+

Very Good Game (like to play and never will turn it down).

An old favourite, this truly classic game is very influential and is the root of most of the games I like. 

This "light wargame" set-up a bunch of great games that weren't as complicated as die-hard 'real' wargames but were more complicated than 'mere' "beer and pretzels" boardgames -- a compromise but one that works well for me.

Flawed mechanics but fun to tinker with and play for nostalgia. As long as I don't use the "optimal" strategy and instead experiment with some more off the wall things and engage in thick "table talk" it's still a heck of a lotta fun. 

Revised is so much better so I'm not sure if I'd play the original much anymore except for the old Iron Blitz alternate history scenarios.

This was an interesting game when it first came out. The idea of trying to conquer the world in WWII is always a fascinating exercise in "what if?" The only problem was that it required five players, most of the day, and a lot of patience.

I am certain this game deserves a higher rating than I give it, considering its popularity and all.  I played a few rounds a few decades ago but never finished out.  All the components are nice, the board is nice, too.  The components deserve a higher rating, but this just isn't really my favorite genre big box combo.  I'd rather do TI3 in a full fantasy environment, or the old school EH and SPI games for combat sim.

The first 'wargame' that many young gamers ever played. The balance is not what one might hope and the manufacturing system could use some tweaks but the sheer joy of tossing handfuls of dice outweighs many faults. Simple, but fun, coverage of WW II. While the strategy may be a bit suspect (I always enjoyed trying to get my Japanese troopers into Canada), all those pieces look really neat on the board. Look for several expansions, especially one from Xeno games that starts the conflict in 1939 and adds the French.

One of those games that gave me the gentle shove to gaming.  Played thousands (well, over 20 anyways) times and have decided that it is not worth my time. Despite what anyone says, the winner is already pre-determined before the box is openned.  (I mean, why is there the variant to bid on who plays the Allies).  The combat system is neat, the building and resource management is simple, the game board is unbalanced.  If they would come out with a balanced map and player set up, it would improve the game.  Of course, then it would become more of an advanced Risk

The game that really started me on the road to gaming in general, and wargaming in particular. I've had it since my 12th birthday. Little did my parents know that nearly 25 years later I'd be still into this sort of thing....

The gameplay is a bit simple for my tastes now, and is totally ahistorical. Really, really wierd things can (and usually do) happen. It is, however, a fun, easy game to get into, and can be used to rope the uninitiated into a game.

RATING: 7
This game is very hard for me to rate.  I might never play it again, but I have played it more than any other wargame except Squad Leader and A House Divided.  The game's flaws are legion and well documented.  Historicity is a complete joke, with the USSR and Japan at war and the US well advised to invade Spain.  Balance is poor, as the Axis will find victory unlikely in the second edition and nearly impossible in the first.  The excessive point values on some of the naval units amplify the already high luck element of the roll-to-hit combat system.  There are optimum strategies for at least some of the nations.  At anywhere from 2-8 hours, playing time is unacceptably variable.  Still, despite all of these flaws, I've had loads of fun with this game through the years.

To play there is lots preparation (reading & learning concepts) & game play takes hours including deliberation with 4-5 (which makes it quite fun). Probably would have missed out on this game had I been exposed to it now. There are so many good games out there that are a better %u201Cbang for the buck%u201D for a first time player (not as long & just as fun). As a seasoned veteran of the game, I love playing & can't keep from thinking of what I could have done differently after I play (win or lose). Sign of a great game? An exciting, intense game with so many options! I only recommend the game for those A&A enthusiast however I always try to talk people into giving this a try. For a shorter game, play two-player. We managed two games & both in record times. Perhaps the deliberation causes the game to be excessively long. Of course, my opponent was rolling poorly, I was rolling great & he conceded when in a group we would have played another couple of rounds refusing to give in.

I played the crap out of this game a long time ago when I was young as well as on the computer.  I prefer games where all the players start out with the same or very close to equivalent starting resources, units, etc.  I also like games like Settlers of Catan or Amerigo or Istanbul, whose board changes every time you play, which keeps the game interesting and promotes replayability.  Axis and Allies is an all time great board game, I think I have just played it too many times and I am weary of having the asymmetrical nations with all their various military units starting in the exact same provinces every single game.  Once you have played A&A many times, it is like the same thing over and over, why don't we just get a big bucket of dice and play without the board?  Also, this game suffers from extremely long set-up time and very long play time.  There is tremendous downtime between turns as well.  I would feel very remiss if I didn't give the game its due.  Axis and Allies is an all-time great game and was extremely influential.  When it was released and in the several years afterwards, it was THE game to play.  I think it is a very useful game for players of all ages 12 or 13+ to play because they will learn more about World War II and improve their knowledge of geography.

This rating is for the old version.  It has a place in my heart as one of my favourite games of my youth but it doesn't make the grade any more.  I would like to try the revised rules with the new edition(s)

RATING: 7
Well worn box.  Nice area control wargame with simple combat resolution, better than Risk, but still dice driven lucky rolls.  Can be quite long and unbalanced against the Axis powers.  Looks good and has sound mechanics to it, although not necessarily very deep in strategy (Risk made fancy).

An excellent addictive and relatively easy game to learn. It has loads of fun and replay value. That this game changed wargaming in an important way I think is clear. Non-wargamers and even non-gamers generally are willing to give the game a go and enjoy themselves every time. If one is going to buy just one wargame, this is the one to get.

I've had this one for 15-16 years and have not played it in a long time.  It was a fairly good game, BUT it gets stale and tedious upon repeated playings.  Same opening setup everytime= repetitive gameplay.  Despite this I would recommend this as worthwhile step for any gamer.  Those that accuse it of just being a Risk-like dice fest are wrong.  If played properly, solid strategy and tactics will win out 90% of the time.  The other 10% can be chalked up to the chaos of war, and I like it that way.

RATING: 7
Excellent classic style wargame that surpassed RISK by far, lots of strategy that is still dice/luck driven but its a much better game and there is much more detail here making it more realistic than that game. I love fighting in the air, sea and land with different units all with different attributes. 

It took 3 of us newbies in our teens all those years ago 10 hours or more to read the rules and understand them. Only quantity and quality of rules (there are many holes) that need checking during play stopped this from being an 8 or higher for me. Replayability is there it just gets more and more predictable with the same set-up. All in all very fun game that plays well but runs long (3 to 6 hours), recommended as 2 player or 4 player(teams),downtime to high with 3.

Update: 8 => 7 Okay it finally happened, after loving this game for years and playing many many games ... I now hate this f^&(&*ing game!  This outdated piece of overproduced luck-filled crap has seen my table for the last time! 

Okay seriously, this game is way too long and the damn dice can ruin you if you have a continual long streak of bad rolls (which just happened to me if you couldn't tell), usually the luck with dice will even out but when it doesn't.. . damn it! It is also a little too scripted with the same set-up although if you only play once a year it isn't too bad but still annoying. I would like to devise a couple of other starting set-ups or poke around to find others that have already. It's a shame, such a nice wargame with things like Strategic bombing, an economic system, factories, a tech tree and fighting in sea, land and air (many newer games don't have some of these elements) but I'm done for a good while if not forever and I'm going to be buying some other good wargames that are hopefully more realistic, shorter and less dependant on dice.

House rule suggestion: If you roll over 3 on at least 3 dice and you don't hit something roll 2 dice again? If someone has a fix please email me...

A dice fest. The game goes on too long after it's pretty clear which side is going to win.  Still, I played this alot back in the day.  Can be very exciting at times. Bits and theme are great.  Some goofy chrome (e.g., special weapons).

A true classic and the second best of the GameMaster series of games after Shogun/Samurai Swords. One of the better games to ever come out of the U.S., plus you have to love the bits, especially if you add some decals to them. Very long game though, not usually finished up in one night and, of course, it is a dicefest.

RATING: 10
Ah, the good times of my youth!  I suppose there may be better games now, but I cannot bring myself to get this off my shelf.  I will probably play it with my kids when they're old enough, at least once.  Playing with house rule is a must!  Allied victory is too easy unless you add something like a bidding mechanic.  ("How many extra starting units will you give me as Axis for me to allow you the joy of being Allies?")

2017-10-30: I re-boxed the game to make more room on the shelf, cutting out the 75% wasted air space.
https://boardgamegeek.com/image/3808452/axis-allies
2017-11-21: Played again after all these years.  Axis (played by me) won the game pretty easily, which surprised me a bit.  Increased rating to 10 (mostly because the overall is way too low at 6.5) and will be using bidding house rule from now on.

As a pure fun simple game, I loved it. Some say it was unbalanced and quirky.  It was a game I played many times before passing my copy off to my 14 year old nephew...(after hooking him on it).  Gotta keep the next generation coming!

RATING: 8
I guess this one is a "classic" in my circle of friends. We have been playing it for 20 years or so now. 

Very luck driven. You can watch your vastly superior force go splat as your dice refuse time and time again to roll anything even remotely good. However, there is certainly strategy and skill involved in deciding what to buy, where to send it, and whether or not to attack/defend various regions.

Very long game, definitely a full day sort of activity. Eventually, after many plays, you will find that people fall into predictable strategies because there are a handful that just plain work and many that just plain don't.

It's luster has definitely dulled for me over the years but I must say I still enjoy breaking it out once or twice a year even after all this time.

RATING: 4
The most successful of the Gamemaster series, but not deservedly so, as Shogun (now Samurai Swords) is a much more interesting and re-playable game.  I even prefer the more obscure "Fortress America" for its flawed but interesting assymetrical opponent play.  
Axis and Allies will get play from me once my son (now 1) becomes old enough to learn war games;  this one will be about a year after Risk.  For adults, it is just too predictable and formulaic, with little incentive to look for alternative strategies for any of the powers.  That coupled with the HUGE downtime between turns, even with expert players, and the relative inactivity of the Americans for the first 1/3 of the game and this game is just too weildy.

I own the original NOVA paper version which saw a lot of action in those pre-german, let's avoid complexity 10, wargaming days.

A classic...  I can't begin to count how many games I've played.  Each of the original and the newer versions are well worth a slot in any collection.

Some may dislike the amount of dice rolling, but I find that the 'luck' averages out over the course of a game, and finishes are usually very tense... come-from-behind victories are not that uncommon.

I played Axis & Allies a handful of times in high school, and while I look back on those memories with some nostalgia, I recognize that I'll likely never play this version of the game again. That being said, this game has its place in the history of the hobby and took wargaming a new direction for its time. Subsequent editions have improved upon the concepts here to the point that this version is now obsolete. You had a good run, A&A. Thanks for the memories.

Like Chess, if you haven't studied up on the classic opening moves then you've had it against a seasoned player.  The theme is fun but there are too many vagueries to make this game anything more than Risk.

If this game wasn't SO imbalanced in favor of the allies, it would rate much higher. I understand later editions address this, but I can't say I'm interested enough to find out for myself. Still, this is a landmark game that brought light wargaming to the masses and deserves some respect. THE game of the 80's, in my book.

This is the game that really started me on my road to geekdom.  Many many long hours spent playing this one.  One of the most memorable games of this was a 5 player game played at my local Steak N Shake!  We drew quite a lot of stares from the other customers that night.  Its been a long time since I have played this one by itself, normally if this hits the table it is accompanied by several aftermarket expansions which totally change the game.

Aleady a classic played it to serious wear and tear when i was young, still fun. Made extra rules to increase difficulty and realism, but now there are expansions.

This was my third in the "Gamemaster" series and what a fun romp it was. Man! no other game that I know of came with all the plastic chrome this had and that really helped sell the game and what a game it was. Marching troops and tanks across the battlefield sending in air support. Huge naval battles and aircraft carriers that you could really land your planes on. Great memories and a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have to rate this game higher than I might objectively would at this stage of my gaming hobby due to the special place it has in my memories of being my first serious and complex board game.  I spent many Friday nights into Saturday mornings playing this game with my best friend from high school.  I never seemed to be a good dice roller, so I never liked that aspect of battle, but I love mulling over the various strategies and seeing how they play out.

The original A&A is the boardgame I've probably played most in my life and I played it twice in the last 12-24 months, before we decided to try the 2004 edition and we haven't looked back.

2nd Edition veteran player.  Newbies find this game intriguing to learn as sort of magnified and richer Risk, and are kept intrigued by looking for a winning strategy. 

This version has balance problems as written, but veteran players usually get around it by either going to victory points (IPC) bid down (to make it easier on the Axis), or adding 9 IPC reinforcements to the Axis at the start. A lesser satisfactory balancer is to forbid the Russians from attacking first turn.

I fell in love with this game in high school and still have a very beat up copy on my shelf.  Repeat plays can be samey: the Russians have to defend, Germany has to balance attack with Russia while holding off UK, Japan has to control Pacific naval control while putting some pressure on Asia mainland, etc.  There is definitely strategy but this game is very heavy on luck.  The dice rolls can decide a game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of my favorite games.  It&#039;s not &quot;perfect&quot; as a game, but does a nice job evoking the theme, and allows for a grand, sweeping feel.  My rating is probably more for nostalgia than for gameplay, but with the right crowd, this one really delivers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is an old game and it feels old.  Turns take a long time, meaning there's lots of down time for everyone else, even in just a two player game.  With that said I'd love to make it through just one complete playthrough of the game because it is very strategic and historic.  Maybe a newer version of the game is better.  I have 1st edition.

Thinking back to my teenage years this was hands down my favourite board game.  I haven't played it since then, but I had some fond memories.

Perhaps it's nostalgia that has me rating it high, but I remember it as a more strategic and complex Risk with a much better theme.  From the five factions to the different types of units available, it just made for a great competitive game... providing you had a few hours to play.

Loved this game as a kid, and to be honest I could never convince anybody to ever finish a game with me.  The two idiot neighbor kids that I would try to play with always played the allies and I would be the axies...the only thing that they were ever conserned about or ever tried to do was attack each other...because there is no way the USA and USSR would ever be on the same side...sigh.

Based on 4 plays.  Admittedly, I don't think I've ever played a game out to completion.  After a few hours, all the players just cease to care and we start picking up the pieces, even if there's no clear winner.  Too long, too repetitive early on, and not a whole lot of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Lots of hours spent here.  There are possibly better games coming out now, but in terms of replay value, this is a bastion of solidity in the war-game canon. If you like WWII games, and haven't tried this.  You are missing something in your life.

RATING: 9
At least 100 plays of this game and lots of nostalgia give this a high rating in my book.  Some will surely rate this lower than me.

A great game for occasional play but I personally find that it, like its other Game Master series siblings, suffers from a bad case of every-game-the-same.

First time I ever played was with some guys on my floor in the dorms.  I played Japan.  I had no idea about what strategy Japan takes in the game.  I made one up.  My teammate called me mad.

Still a very amazing game if it didnt take so long.

Fun, tense game.  Only WWII strategic game that I've found to be playable in a single session.  However, the Russians don't have a lot of options, so it works best with 4 or fewer players.

I thrifted this and a BGG'er sent me a few pieces to complete the game.  Unfortunately, I moved cross country and this game didn't survive the cut to get packed up with the games.  I had to cut my collection by a third and the size of this game and the fact that it was unlikely to get played made it a relatively easy pick to find a better home.  And I gave it away to a very appreciative fellow geek, so all is well.

Hate to rate a game this so low when it plays just fine for what it is. But I played the USA and probably waited 45 minutes for my first turn. When it finally came, I couldn't even attack anything, so I was done in 2 minutes. Not a good way for a game to endear itself.

The other thing that is a big minus to my mind is that when one player is taking his turns, if you're not being attacked, you can wander off for 15 minutes and not miss anything. Too slow moving for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After several years of thinking I was done with it, I find I am once again enticed by Axis and Allies.  Intellectually I know there are better games out there.  But there is some nostalgia embedded into this game, and playing a game with the plastic is fun.

First played this about 15 years ago and it is still a favourite, with  good players always a tense close struggle, players need to combine both strategy and tactics although I believe strategy is over-riding, on the downside the downtime with &gt; 2 players can be annoying and the time to play can be (if close) greater than an evening.

Great game for beginners, non-gamers and veterans. Only downfalls are it&#039;s a bit long and no diplomacy.

The beginning of the cash-cow for Larry Harris.  Seemed to take a long time for miniature boardgaming to take off and this games successors are really cashing in now.

A grand strategic experience, however.

Unnecessarily long, I am not a fan of this strategy game (still trying to find a better one though) or the combat mechanics. Industrial Revolution discovery for Germany in the early game can guarantee German victory as early as the first turn since a couple tanks attacking with a pile of infantry is impossible to defend against (since the attacker chooses his own casualties).

I probably will not play this game again.

The poorly organized rules and so-so components of this game (2nd Edition) did not grab me right out of the box.  However, after a couple of plays with my son, I found this a very fun strategy game with a lot of exciting back and forth.  Supposedly, if you take this seriously, the Axis can't win.  Well, if you take it that seriously, you should play a real wargame.  However, if you want some strategy and also to make machinegun and divebomber sounds while rolling dice, this is a good game.

Played this to death when it first came out. I've since tired of it, and don't ever really feel like playing it unless pressed. It seems to boil down to whether German wins the mass dice rolls on the Ostfront, and then whether the player playing the United States doesn't completely screw up somehow. You can win as Germany and Japan, but you have to be good, and your opponents have to be dumb. Keeping it for my kids as it's still a good game for the first dozen plays or so. Potential parts-fodder, can buy new version and get revised rules and parts.

Don't get to play this much, but I personally love it. It is one that you don't want to play over and play in a short period, one because it is so long, and two because it usually plays out the same way.  But I hope to get it out at least once a year.

Despite the long set up, I get a feeling of satisfaction when I play this game. It's basic war gaming yet it also simulates the realistic general movements of WW2. Beats any Avalon Hill Panzer game - it's accessible to non and war gamers alike.

I've been playing it online a lot and I'm reaching a point of saturation. I can see now that memorized opening moves really make this game suffer a Puerto Rico curse--playing with experienced players makes it more of an exercise in waiting to see who will get the worst die roll first. Still love it but I think I'd get War of the Ring or other offerings out first most every time.

Axis & Allies is not a GAME, it's just an ornament in your bookshelf. :D
A lot of miniatures, a lot of dice rolling and that's it. Boring one. But if you want a game or even better: if you want a WARGAME, then try 'Hammer of the Scots' or 'Age of Napoleon' (AoN is the better one, I think).

I played this game dozens of times starting in college --- it was a great beer & pretzels game -- when you played 5 players you could get some studying done while waiting for your turn, lol. Keep it for sentimental reasons but I fear that it's not as awesome as I recall it being hence the low rating. For it's time, it was great, but the designer boardgames revolution has tossed this one into history.  (But it's still better than Risk!)

After playing bells of war, I think the element I hate most about this game is the combat system. The axis and allies combat system works well in games were you have few types of units and a lot of units in play. I works pretty bad when there are a lot of types of units with few units in the battle. That goes double for Twilight imperium who use the same combat system and any other game that use the same system in these conditions.

Second, the scale of the map is too large, it makes battle not really strategic, it's my stack of units VS yours.

This has a mostly nostalgic value for me, as I played it with my brothers growing up. But as this is a dice game and the tide can turn horribly or magnificently based on a few rolls, I would rather play many, many other games before I play this. Also the strategy is fairly obvious.
That being said, I've never had a particularly bad playthrough with Axis & Allies, so I gave it a decent rating. It's an oldie but a goodie!

Entre le jeu de société et le wargame...
Un bon jeu... certes un peu long... mais en même temps... simuler le second conflit mondial en un jeu de 45 minutes... ca aurait été un peu limite, je pense...
J'y ai joué avec 4 autres amis... Toutes les nations jouables étaient occupées. Alors, certes, le hasard est présent... et un bon lancer de dé (ou un mauvais !) peut être déterminant... Mais parce que tant de jets de dés sont si déterminants... la partie tient en haleine... longtemps: la partie que j'ai faite à durer un peu plus de 7 heures... mais personne ne s'est rendu compte du temps passé... C'était très prenant.
C'est en même temps un de ces inconvénients... Pour être vraiment sympa, il vaut mieux y jouer à 5, et avoir du temps devant soit... Par contre, à proscrire certainement à tout ceux qui s'énervent dès qu'un jet de dés est raté, ou trop réussi chez l'adversaire...

This is a good board game, though "luck of the roll" can sometimes severly compromise your strategies. I don't know if I've ever seen the United States lose in this game, but that's probably why the rule is to defeat two countries instead of three.

My first step up, graduating from Risk back in my college years. (the late 80's/early 90's.)  I have bad-guy complex, and I almost always try and play counter-history by seeing if I can pull it off for the Axis.  Getting Japan into South America and Alaska helps bog things down.  Getting lucky with German tech also helpful.  In the end, the game isn't particularly sophisticated, and has been largely replaced by Tide of Iron for my wargaming fix.

RATING: 6
I like playing it - but I never get to! For one thing, it takes too long to set up (for me, over 30 minutes) and play (5-6 hours). Then, I can never get five players, and its not as fun with two. Lastly, its not fun with people who are really good at it (the "Nazi-Communist reductio"), which adds another constraint. Still, the 5-6 times I did get to play were a blast. The long playing time is the biggest problem, if it could be condensed to 2 1/2 hours at maximum it would be a lot better.

RATING: 5
Despite the different units, a decent (if fiddly with too many dice and rerolls) combat system with you using units just so they can act as a buffer to prevent your better units from dying, geography mattering a good deal in what units you need via creating regions for your armies to traverse through, and income, and each nation feeling significantly different from the other due to this geography, the seesawing quagmire of border regions being captured back and forth. This makes the game feel tedious rather than as if you are accomplishing something; it's never good when I'm halfway through a game and I want it to be over. That is not even considering the very long setup time.

One of the defining, if not THE defining game of my childhood/teenager years.

A game I've played countless times, mostly against a friend of mine, and which provided immense fun and has IMHO an almost endless replayability factor despite its static starting setup (every time things were starting to shift in favour of one of the two sides, we adopted some new strategy which allowed to even the balance again).

During the mid-90ies I also bought two unofficial expansions from Gamers Paradise (titled "WW2 Expansion" and "WW2 Expansion 2") which added many new rules for naval vessels (and submarines! They're totally different in my game now and much, much more realistic and deadly) and which added many new units and rules for them, too (like airborne fighters for Japan and USA, trucks, paratroopers, German Waffen-ϟϟ, US Marines, Japanese pillboxes, British Commandos etc.). With them the fun and replayability factor went up another notch and, after a rather long hiatus from A&A during the 2000-2014 period (more or less) I recently had the chance to play some other games of it. 

Well, I had a blast just like then!!!

My first introduction to board games in a class above and beyond the complexity of Monopoly, Risk, and Scrabble.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.  I think the game is balanced fairly enough, though the fulcrum isn't in the middle of the lever.  There's only a few viable strategies to pick from once you get to know the game, but there are a large variety of ways to implement them.  The winner is almost always the player with the better tactical implementation of their strategy.

Risk management is a core element of the game, along with strategic planning for future moves.  Makes a great game for those players looking to graduate into a more involved war game than Risk.

Tremendous nostalgia value in this game; however, newer versions of A&A especially 2004 Revised replaces the game.

It suffers from some map problems where Africa is too easily overrun.  It also has a strategy that requires you to build infantry for far too long.  Tech is very overpowered, especially Heavy Bombers. 

I probably would never play this version again.  But cannot part with the original editiion because of nostalgia value.

However, I will probably never play it again.  I think it was the neat plastic bits (first game of that type for me) and the ability to buy whatever additional forces you desired that intrigued us.  Now it's just infantry, infantry and more infantry.

I love to play Axis and Allies !!
Just dont have anyone to play with. :(
I purchased my game when I was in high school, probably around 1985 or 1986.
The game takes a very long time, and people who play must have the patience for it. Though there has been a time of two (years ago), when we would play half a game, leave the game on the table over night, and finish the game the next day. I love the game, so the time passes without a problem for me. Interested players must also have the willingness to read and study the extensive rule book, so its not a game that can be suddenly brought out to play with anyone unfamiliar with it.

If I had more of a "gamer" support group for this game, I would probably invest in the newer A&A games. I understand that the most recent "Pacific 1940" and "Europe 1940" games can be combined into one huge battle map ! Now that would be one hell of a war stategy game ! I just cant say enough about Axis and Allies.

Its a good wargame, but its really the fun-to-time ratio that kills it for me. That and most games always reach that inevitability point; its pretty obvious who is gonna win, but you're simply going through the motions. 
Also, the paths to victory are pretty limited and predictable.

Boring. The game never ends. It would be alright if everyone was devoted to play and would stay put with their phone shut off. Also must be played with everyone actively planning their next move out while it is not their turn otherwise you end up with a six to eighteen hour game. Good to play once a decade.

When I was a youth pastor, one of my students introduced me to this complicated game.  Generally tons of fun to play with adolescent guys (or at least guys who still feel/act like adolescents).  However, it's not unusual for the game to end in bored resignation rather than a true victory.

The game that started the addiction when I was a ripe age of 11.  Amazing game.  Classic.  I'll always keep my copy in my collection for the memories and artwork alone.  Gameplay gets tired from some design limitations.  Revised addition is great if you can find it.  Makes the starting position much more balanced than the original.

I was just graduating from High School when this came out...and while college is typically a halcyon period of gaming for many...for me it was a busy time. What with studies and other interests (read between the lines), I kind of strayed from gaming in college. Fast forward a few years and it felt like I had missed the interest curve on this one. Fast forward 27 years...I played my first game on 10/28/06...I can see why this belongs in the Hall of Gaming Fame. Just a great game. We played for 5 hours...and with a lot of luck and Corey's handicapping of the victory conditions, I won. I am eager to play again. I would really like to try the revised edition now.

RATING: 6.8
Axis & Allies has a special nostalgic place in my heart, as it was arguably the first true in-depth strategy board game that I played - and I spent many a fine Saturday in high school and college (typically playing with/against my future brother-in-law - who I continue to play boardgames against to this day).

Axis & Allies is a sweeping, epic strategy recreation of WWII that was originally released as part of Milton Bradley's Gamemaster Series that featured other similar grand-themed, high strategy wargames like Samurai Swords and Fortress America.

In recreating the dynamics of World War II, Axis & Allies succeeds. Game play occurs between teams composed of the Allied players versus the Axis players. The Axis players of Japan and Germany have the initial advantage in terms of positioning and army strength and are able to do a lot of damage to the Allies (USA, Britain, and Russia) early on.  The Allies need to work together to quickly buildup and engage their forces against the Axis tide - before the Axis achieve an economic victory (a victory possibility available only to the Axis) or manage to overwhelm Russia (which doesn't guarantee victory, but taking out one of the players usually all but guarantees total victory for the other side).  Players can fight battles on the global boardgame map in at sea, land, in the air, or even all three.  Tanks, infantry, fighters, bombers, submarines, transports, battleships, and aircraft carriers are all available to be included as part of a player's armed forces.  The game does also try to include an economics factor to the game, with the military units that each faction is able to produce requiring a certain quantity of Industrical Production Credits (the in-game currency) which are awarded based on the IPCs produced by the faction's held territories and with an option to attempt high risk research into potentially game-changing technologies that award a clear advantage to the acquiring player.  The game components are of fairly high quality - with the board game map colorful and engaging and the plastic pieces detailed and diverse and customized for each faction.  The theme speaks for itself and is tightly integrated with the game mechanics.

The biggest drawback to Axis and Allies is the playing time. The alleged playing time is 3 hours, but the games I've played have typically taken all day - and to be honest, I've only actually finished a live-in-person game from start to finish in one sitting once (all other games we didn't finish but got to a point where all agreed that in all likelihood either the Axis or the Allies would have triumphed). With each player's turn broken up into multiple phases and add in the need to consult with your allies, turns can be lengthy.  The other drawback too is that, at least with experienced players, the overall strategy for both sides tends to be pretty much the same from game to game.  Russia and Britain try to hold out and try keep Germany off balance while the USA works to bring its economic might to bear while working to gets its military across the pond to build up to try to launch a D-Day invasion of Europe - all before Japan is able to race through Asia to knock Russia out from behind.  It always seems that Germany and Russia end up bogged down in a stalemate on the Eastern Front - with both building competing stacks of infantry before one player decides to go for it all and risk everything in a giant battle.  Additionally, dice is used to resolve attacks and although the dice are weighted (more expensive units have a higher probability of scoring a hit against an enemy than cheaper units), there is still a fairly decent luck factor (there's no sorrow greater than seeing your entire air force squadron wiped out with a phenomenal roll by the defending player's AA gun.  Additionally, aside from the early game, naval units don't really play a big role - with the Axis quickly opting to purchase exclusive land and air units.  The more recent updated editions of Axis & Allies that have been released I believe have attempted to at least address some of these critiques with a re-vamped board, new units, and additional rules - but obviously those aren't available with those version - although there are some intriguing house variant rules available on the web.  For game this size and scope, the rules aren't awful - but they certainly are complex and will take a couple of overviews before new players grasp them (and they'll undoubtedly requiring coaching on some of the finer points throughout - so fortunately A&A is a team game).

Overall, Axis & Allies will have a lot of appeal based on the theme alone to war gamers, strategy enthusiasts, and history buffs who love an immersive, global scale game.  Just be sure you have a free block of at least 6+ hours to play -you'll need it.

RATING: 7
Rating is for the original A&A.  I've had too much fun playing this game to rate it any lower.  It benefits from friendly agreements between the players to try a different approach each time, as the system itself does not promote deviations from the "optimal" moves (especially on the first turn or two), which leads to somewhat scripted play.  I really don't need to see another huge, game-deciding fight for Karelia in the second turn.

Still, I look forward to teaching this game to my sons when they get a little older.

RATING: 4
Probably best with 2, and if I'm only playing with 2 I'd rather play something else, such as a real wargame, or a Knizia cardgame or chess, or whatever.  With more players, and the insane time requirements, we could play Civ or Britannia or Junta or anything, really.  It's maybe not broken, but it is very weak.  I don't get the overwhelming appeal of this game.

The economic victory condition of 84 pts for the Axis at the end of a complete round makes a very balanced game by using the one optional rule that prohibits Russia from attacking on the first turn. The economic track creates lots of tension as the Axis approach the high water mark of 79-86 pts by about turn 6. Axis wins shortly thereafter about 50% of the time. No other WWII global game matches this classic but the search continues.

Replayed this recently after more then a decade with four friends (face-to-face, but with the help of TripleA). I have to admit, almost ashamedly, that I have not been as engaged in any game for a long while (while having my clocked cleaned as Germany, to boot). The game was solidly designed and has great flavor.

Seen by the light of day of course, the sheen comes off quickly. There are all the old problems. The fact that the deck is fundamentally stacked against the Axis and that there is really only one viable winning strategy for every side results in a weird cat-and-mouse game over the first couple of turns, where everybody is trying to follow his script as perfectly as possible while savoring the tiniest variations from this grand program. In those early stages, the Allies only have to do this competently, while the Axis has to be perfect. One misstep by the Axis, and it is usually Game Over then and there, 

But if it works out and everybody goes through the motions, the game can (and needs to) be pushed to a surreal number of turns (say, 15) where everyone finally reaches undiscovered country. Then of course, the length of the game, at 4-5 hours with five players already a huge problem, becomes downright bizarre for what should be a fun plastic-pusher.

Interestingly enough, I don't find the luck factor particularly problematic anymore. There are those game-deciding "three awful turns in a row", but usually it plays out the way it should according to what the players do tactically and strategically.

Would be higher, but I get tired of trying to learn everyone's home rules everytime I play. (Similar to monopoly in that respect in that its popularity decreases its rating) It seems like this game turns into a legal battle of rule interpretation.

It'd be nice to have a little better naval option than battleship/submarine/transport

Takes a Gazillion years to set up but once that's done I Highly suggest munchies and Beer are part of the set up, make sure the damn TV is off and your buddies are in the mood to play. Darn frustrating watching the game progress and one player decides it's taking to long and want's to move on to something else or throws the game since the attention span (blame the beer) is getting short. This one is all right if you set up the game before your pals come so they don't get all figity doing it or eat all the chips before the game even starts.

I like war games of this scale. It's fairly balanced, but there's not much choice for some nations. Germans have to attack Russia very early on with panzers, and Russians need to buy masses of infantry to defend. This battle usually decides the game very early on.

2008-03-04 Middle of game, 4 or so turns in.  GF liking so far as allies.  Update: game finished, with (me) Germany surrounded with Japan having no chance to rescue.  Rather than face the long game of attrition, I decided to surrender.  A very critical mistake allowed the Allies to hold Germany for 1 turn - I attribute that as my biggest factor for defeat.

This inspired me to re-acquire Fortress America and I'm looking forward to playing that.

I&#039;ve played this more than any other game on my list by far. A better game with custom rules (as an Axis / Japan player, I particularly detest the latest rules that don&#039;t allow new industrial complexes, and limit captured ones – more “real”, but much harder on the already disadvantaged Axis). Nova Edition and the new Pacific and Atlantic editions are more playable... hopefully a reissue of the standard game will incorporate some of the other games into it.

It's Risk, but with more varity in units and more strategy. And yet I don't give it a higher rating. Player turns take too much time, which really tests the attention span of the four other players.

The true hard-hex gamers go crazy because they cannot "rules lawyer" this game.  I love hard-hex SPI/AH/GMT/GDW games but this is a short sharp game on WWII, playable within an evening.  Good still today, but only the original 1984 version, not all the junk add-ons.  We bid starting IP's for the Allies.  Great game.

I see this game as being in the "no man's land" of being too complicated for non-gamers, but without the merit that would appeal to gamers. It, like many popular wargames, can tend to be a dicefest.

By far one of my favorite games.  It is a fun game and depending on who's playing can be nailbiting.  Shame that the game is pretty much decided by the third or fourth turn though.

Note:  Even though this isn't the revised edition, the revised edition takes care of some of the issues of the originaly games.  The addition of the destroyer gives a naval option other than a battleship or submarine.  The addition of artillery makes those hordes of infantry more useful.  The addition of victory cities gives other avenues for victory.

Game in a Nutshell: Manage resources to buy different troops, tanks, planes and boats. Then make plans to overthrow your enemy via dice recreating WWII. 

Played as: 2 player and 5 with people dropping (too long) to 4 and 3 in same game.

Pros: This is the first game I remember loving that contained any sort of complexity. Even the last time I played, it was pretty epic and entertaining.

Cons: At this point I could play three other solid games in the time it averages for this game to go from beginning to end. Also, it might be nice if there was some sort of cap on infantry to avoid 'last-stand' half-hour long infantry stand-off in Japan. Felt like a lot of down time with more then two people playing.

Best Use: For two border-line war gamers with a good chunk of time or for getting Risk fans past Risk.

Initially, this felt as complicated as a regular wargame -- maybe because figurines have no icons, so you need to look things up in the rule book.  Setup takes a long time.

Played with the right group of people this can be quite fun, although finishing is rarely an option.  The piece handling adds quite a bit of time to the game.

This is the first "advanced" board game I tried, and it got me into board games. For this reason it will always be dear to me, though I've since then had better (like the various World at War versions).

This game gets bashed a bit for seeming too repetative, and I keep hearing about full proof strategies that hand such and such side a victory every time....which apparently I am too dopey to figure out.  But a good friend of mine and I had a game that lasted 3 DAYS, which saw Russia fall,then come back, AND a full blown invasion of SOUTH America.  Plus you push little plastic army guys around the board...what&#039;s better than that?  This game is a classic and great to teach novice wargamers with, and still have fun with your experienced opponents.

Probably played this game more than any other as a teenager.  We had map rooms and house rules (randomly choosing territories and playing risk style).   Very fun but now it's kind of tedious and I feel it can be quite unbalanced.  Haven't tried any of the newer versions and probably won't.  I've grown past this game but will always hold it dear to my heart.

This was my very first wargame my dad used to introduce me to the world of wargaming.  I started learning how to play this since I was around 6.   I have played this game many, many times and had lots fun everytime.  We wore this game out to where we now own 3 original A&A, a 2004 version, and the Pacific version.  We also got ambitious and made up plenty of modified and optional rules.  We normally played this game without the heavy  bombers option because the first country to get it usually won the game.  No one can stand up against 3 dice per bomber.  The smart move for the Allies (USA and even UK) is to just take the first 4 rounds and spend all your money on heavy bombers.  Chances are you'll get it and once you have it... the Axis have no chance in winning.

Got this game for Xmas when I was about 12. I thought it looked an incredibly complex game at the time and was blown away by the size of it with all the miniatures.

A beginning level wargame that displaced Risk as the first wargame that many of my friends played.

As it is a beginning level wargame, the emphasis is on playability, not accuracy.  Advanced Third Reich it ain't.  If you play with 5 people (each with a major power), there's a lot of downtime in the game if it's a) not your turn and b) you're not close to the fighting going on in the current player's turn.  When I used to play this game more frequently in my youth, If you were Japan and it was Germany's turn, you'd get up and get some chips, grab a soda (or, in later years, a beer), and stretch your legs for a bit.  The only guy who kind of had to stick around most of the time was Britain, who had a presence on both ends of the board.

For an introductory wargame it was pretty good, and I've heard some good things about expansion rules and the revised edition, but my heart lies in something like We the People for introductory level wargames.

My first heavy game.  Still enjoy it quite a bit, once I learned to stop caring so much about bad luck.  I've brought it out a couple times in the last year or so and had a good time.  Really rewards unit diversification, which is great, but the tech system stinks.  Probably too long for what it delivers, but still enjoyable.

Great game, difficult. One strategy seems to work for Axis powers (go heavy at Russia quickly and try to get lucky with Tech advances), but if die are not favorable, its a uphill battle. Its a game i would pull out once every few years. Long set-up. Long play.

Arguably the most popular "gateway" game into war gaming.  This was the last wargame I played before going off to college and ironically the first game that I wanted to play when I started getting back into boardgames.  IMHO, one of the true "gateway" games (e.g., Axis & Allies for wargames and Settlers of Catan for eurogames).  Although at first glance, it looks a lot like Risk on steriods, A&A really has a lot more depth and connection to the wargame genre, than most so-called "wargamers" would like to admit.  If you want to get the feel of WWII on a strategic scale without endless calculations on CRT charts/tables, then give A&A a try.  Awards:  GAMES Magazine Hall of Fame (1994).

I own the original version, the '3rd edition' by MB and the latest edition of the game. The last version released is by far the best so far.

A bit beyond 'Beer and Pretzels' in my opinion as it can take quite a commitment to complete a game with good players.

So this is one of those classic games. It is interesting to me to think about playing this in the 80s versus playing this at the present.

Quite honestly, this game is for the yahtzee fanatics who want a little bit of variance in their search for all sixes. We're all always one dice chuck away from glory

Even though I haven't played this 'original' version of this game for nearly 20 years, it would still be for me personally, by a very large margin, the most played board game ever.

Risk on stereoids. Atleast it gives some strategy and its quite fun with three players cooperating against the other two.  Still a little static since the endgame usualy is the same.

This is a good game, expect when you play with the same people over and over that everyone knows what the other one will do and it comes down to dice.  These days, if my friends and I ever play this we always do it with two boards so we can have a fog of war which makes it a lot more fun.

Best played with all 5 countries controlled by different players, this game can take a long time to play but will really challenge your strategy and teamwork skills.  If you really understand your history you can use that to your advantage and hope the dice roll in your favor.  I played the heck out of this when I was younger and it still holds up today as fun way to kill an afternoon.

Risk with resources, but it takes a long time to play. I also wonder if certain moves are scripted eg Britian has to build a power plant, Germany overruns Russia, etc. All the rule proposals for multiple hits for destroyers, air craft carriers suggest these units are too expensive to build in isolation.

A great game because you run into so many people that know it, even those that don't consider themselves gamers may haven given this game a try at some point in life.  It is a bit tedious to set up and can take a bit longer to play than most are willing, but it has a great game mechanic and isn't too hard a step to pick up.  I describe it as a more complex version of Risk.

[b]Axis & Allies[/b]

World War II strategy game for 2-5 players.

'A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...', this had been tremendously fun.

It's an "Ameritrash" game where you resolve battle with dice. Different units = different strengths. 

Some cons: 
-depending upon the players, game length can be measured in days due to "analysis paralysis" and military buildup. A game clock will help somewhat.

-player elimination (thus it's best as a 2-player game)

-luck of the dice, although some will argue perhaps correctly (more dice=less luck)

Need a lot of time and patience to commit to this game. A good tabletop war game with spatial control and actual reality setting (historical). Has the added bonus of all miniatures supplied, no need for assembly or painting etc. Heavy on dice rolls, thus a lot of bad luck can ruin your game.

Played a couple times and shipped across the country.  Some shelf ware and tape on two sides of the box--not structural, but previously used by shippers to prevent the box from opening.  Bottom of the box slightly bowed in on the upper right hand corner.  Otherwise in good shape with ware restricted to cosmetic damage to the box.

RATING: 6
Great game, but too weighted on the allies side.  Some small tweaks do a lot for the game.  Bidding on who is germany (how many extra IPC they get when starting, who can bid lowest) makes the game a lot more interesting.  Regardless, a classic game.

The randomness of dice rolls, combined with major balance issues between the factions can make Axis & Allies a good experience on one playthrough and completely miserable the next.

A player's gameplay experience is very dependent on which faction he/she plays. USA gets the freedom to pursue almost any course of action, while USSR is stuck grinding out Infantry every turn until someone defeats one of the Axis powers and by then the game is basically over.

Axis & Allies has been surpassed by many other war games since its release. A&A, and Risk before it, now only serve as a snapshot showing how far modern games have come.

Played this to death despite its length and obvious flaws. This game is as close to solved as a random game can ever get, so keep that in mind when playing against newbies. Still, a great beginners wargame if you make a pact with the other players to shun the internet. Also, used ones are dirt cheap, so just grab it and give it a spin.

RATING: 5
Seems like a good war game. From what I've seen, it could take a while, there was a lot of trading areas back and forth and buildup at certain fronts. Russia fell early, which gave a boost to Germany. We stopped the game around then, but he probably would have continued and taken England. The Pacific battle was more of a buildup until the US could get a significant force within striking distance of Japan. You probably want to attack as soon as you can to avoid too many large battles, which have more chance of turning against you.

I really used to love this game as a kid, and thought the system with funds and research generation was excellent, but looking back at it now I realise that the game itself is quite cumbersome, and games can get bogged down for hours due to turtling players and other bad tactics. My high'ish rating is for the nostalgia trip only.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I have played this game maybe 12 times face to face and at least as many times against the computer.  That is plenty for me.  I cannot help but feel that each country has limited viable options and that makes for a predictable and boring game if you have, like me, played more than a couple of times.  On the plus it is a pretty-looking game with nice pieces – fun just to push little tanks and planes around the board.

I would rate this higher if I was still in my teens.  I loved the game back then.  For now, it is too long with few viable decisions to make.

This was my formal introduction to "wargames."  Fun while it lasted, but this game has insanely huge amounts of downtime.  That's fine when you're young and have no attention span anyway, but as I get older, I want experiences that are more immersive and engaging.

It's okay but kind of meh. Criticisms: Too long for what it is, too random (a lucky roll or two can eliminate a powerful unit which can decide the fate of a nation), not balanced between the teams and nations, some nations are boring to play (e.g. USSR), the strategies are not balanced - there is a always a best strategy which you could theoeretically calculate - provided you could be bothered - but the casino of the combat rolls would dominate most of the time.

Played once. The game recreates WWII with a great deal of detail, but still manage to keep the rules simple enough to avoid scaring less-than-fanatic wargamers. Excellent game material. The set back is that, on the effort to create a setup as close as the real war, the game is slightly unbalanced toward the Allies. (Hans 30-06-06)

I've played many games for many years. I consistently come back to Axis & Allies as pretty much my perfect gaming evening. It is, without doubt, the best in the Gamesmaster series; the others though good, just don't quite match it. Shogun comes close, but is too obviously a derivative of Risk, and Risk is an easier option to set up and play.

Axis and Allies is a clasic war-time strategy game that really doesnt require too much thought to enjoy. Whatever you do, I would not reccomend reading any strategy essays.

Its not the best war game out there but it was the "gateway" war game for many of us so it gets my respect.  I've probably played this more than any other war game.

Gave it away to someone who probably will like it more than me. Not difficult, as I hate this game. Too long, and too difficult to get into this as new player, when you're playing together with experienced players.

Plays like Risk, but with more complicated rules, that do not bring anything worthwhile to the game.

It's too long, the strategies are too obvious, the luck-factor is too high, and the setup takes too much time.  However, there's nothing like breaking this out and pushing plastic all over the map with my boys on a holiday.

RATING: 7
Fun light, strategy wargame. Not difficult to learn at all, but contains a lot of challange. Fighting experienced A&A players could be hard for beginners though (in my first game I was allied with one luckily). I like the high-tension dice-battles - just don't attack with to few troops and back up your soilders with some hard hitting tanks to improve your odds. A natural step-up from Risk.

Axis and Allies is actually a pretty good game and if I could handle the long game (pet peeve #1) and the dice fest (pet peeve #2), I&#039;d probably rate it a 7.  Alas, I can&#039;t, so the 3 stands.

RATING: 7
This is the game which graduated me from the Risk/Monopoly-type games to the Gamemaster series when I was a kid.  It will always have a special place in my heart for it.  I always considered it the ultimate WW2 game.

Due to it being a long game with a long setup, I can't get this to the table anymore and mostly beat up the PC now.  The last time I played it with people was three years ago and it took six hours (when it normally took me less than two in college.)

This game had a lot of love over the years, however with having the Anniversary Ed now, I'd play that every time (when able.)  Gave to a friend and his sons to continue its play over the future years.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Incredibly dry and a eye-stabbingly long setup. 
The worst part is, with all those countries and armies and units, you set it up the same way every time! 

EDIT: This apparently bothered me as a kid. I play games now that do the same thing that I love, so I'm not sure what to think now.

I know people that love this game and study the openings like it was chess. I suppose that it must be very deep although it still depends on dice. Luck is much less important then in Risiko but at the end it turns to be old, lucky, heavy and slow. I cannot rate it more than six.

I enjoy this game although it does have some quirks.  It really is a two player game, but having 5 people makes it easier on the people playing and also play a bit better, since the player going last in a two player game is the same as the one going first.  

Two major quirks: Russia going first (they would seem to me not to have initiative) and the way aircraft move - seems odd in some ways to have leaving Hawaii into the sea around it count as movement "point" - works, but just feels odd.  I do like the addition of the economic feel of the game.

It's not bad, but after playing it so very many times I'd rather play something else. It's become a science for my group, and I feel like the outcome is often set after the first turn, except there are hours left to play.

RATING: 6
The game is pretty simple rulewise, but is pretty challenging when it comes to strategy. There is so many ways to try to conquer the opponents, and as long as you don't get stuck in the "that's-not-what-really-happened" stage it's very entertaining.

I've played it three times so far, and all three times have been pretty different. The different developments change the game a lot. For instance when Germany got Heavy Bombers on their first turn the brittish fleet as well as the russians couldn't touch them. 

If you like simplified wargames with lot's of room for trying different strategies you'll like this game. 

However I do like games with a dynamic start a little better. The start is always fixed in this game, which could make it go stale in the long run - but that's what houserules are for!

Have fun!

RATING: 7
A bit long, but an enjoyable semi-abstractified wargame for a nice range of players.  You will require patience, not only with the game length overall, but with those who take this light game too seriously and over-calculate every move.  It's dice-driven, guys, give it a rest.  The new pieces are an improvement from beck when dorm-mates and I played.

Yes, a dice-fest, but not just that.  Haven't played the zillion expansions, and don't care to.  But the original board offered some interesting choices, and rarely played the same way twice.

I thought this game was to become a favourite, but after playing a few times, we ended up with the same problem. Playing the USA was really boring, because they weren`t able to take part in the war, Russia almost always ended up beaten after 3 rounds and England crawling about on their little island. We must have played poorly, but nevertheless it was a dull and long game.

I loved this game as a kid, but after playing it again as an adult with more experience, it just doesn't have the same magic.  You can get hamstrung early on making it a long losing game without much hope of recovery, and  doesn't really have the depth of choice I would normally like in a game of this length.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
-good miniatures
-A bit of luck and a bit of skill.  Just like war.
-easy to create additional rule sets
-excellent theme incorporation
-after modifying the rule set (basically building expansion) I give it a 2 player 8.

Cons:
-played with 2. a 5 player game I can see leaving a player or 2 mitigated
-can take forever to play
-after a few playes it is obvious that additional rule sets would be a plus

level:
12 and up for sure.

There is a stirring in me that feels like giving this game a 10 every time I see it. But alas, it is a broken game with about a 1 to 2 hour slow death if you are the loser after about round three. Always willing to play it if I don't have to set it up.

The amount of wasted hours of youth on this game was unaccounted for. I do like and enjoy reading about WWII, so this game follows that natural tendency. The simplicity of the game mechanics combined with the long strategic goal make for a really interesting game. I just hope not to play this to the point of mechanically maximizing everything. Thankfully the dice rolling keeps the game unpredictable enough that you can always be a successful underdog or a doomed favorite.

RATING: 6
A good game, but to me, it's a little "pre-programmed", with the same strategies being pretty common from game to game; not an awful lot of differentiation. Game can also be overlong. It has a bit of the feel of original Risk; even when someone has clearly won the game, it still has to continue until the victory conditions are satisfied. The more recent Avalon Hill version is an improvement over previous editions.

The classic game of WWII.  Very neat, with loads of pieces.  The one problem I have with this game is that once you start to slip downhill, there's little hope of turning back.  The result is a VERY slow death that takes hours when the whole time you have no hope of winning.  However, I will play anytime someone wants because it's still a good time.

A brilliant game fairly accurate to WW2 historical war gaming. Much more fun than Risk with nicely-produced game bits that attack and defend differently--roughly corresponding to actual war conditions. Stacked "balance" forces regular players to play certain Axis or Ally armies in similar strategy each game--at least for the first few rounds. Read: after years of playing I got a little bored, and lost my devotion of spending 3-4 hours per game. Still a nice addition to my collection if only for nostaglia's sake.

Played this a lot as a teenager with 3 of my buddies. We would play a game over weeks. We tweaked the rules. Even got an expansion by a different manufacturer, I think it was called Europe at war which had much better rules. We spent many a night relaxing with this baby so I have fond memories of it. If you like Risk, this is the next step. Kept it for the future to play with my kids one day.

RATING: 7
My first war game, and one that I still play. For those who don't know, this is loose recreation of World War 2. I say loose because most games do not ressemble history. The game basically pits Russia, Britain and the US against Japan and Germany. Alliances are fixed, as is the initial setup. This tends to make the game somewhat predictable after a while (people use the same opening moves over and over) but the luck factor can still play havoc with even the best strategies. There are lots of different units (infantry, tanks, fighters, bombers, 4 types of ships) and lots of room for strategy. The biggest flaw is that the board depicts the entire world, and therefore the areas have been simplified a bit too much (Germany is literally 3 spaces from Russia). Overall a great game for casual gamers, but serious simulation gamers will find it lacking.

Usually the next step up from Risk, Axis and Allies provides a net game of strategy with a different dice rolling mechanic.

While a pretty fun game, there&#039;s not much history there.  I mean, let&#039;s face it, the best chance the Axis have to win is by the Japanese driving across Siberia and/or the Hindu Kush and Himalayan Mts. and driving on the Russian capital.  Yeah, like the Japanese really considered that.  And too much emphasis on the dice; a couple of bad rolls at crucial times, and you are really screwed, but I guess you could make that argument for a lot of games (we implemented a suggested variant from &quot;Moves&quot; magazine that really cut down on the luck factor).  But still a fun beer and pretzels game.  Cool bits, and not a bad way to introduce newbies to the hobby of strategy gaming.  I understand that A&amp;A Europe is better.

There will always be a special place in my collection for this one, as it was a key to my developing the passion for boardgames that I have today.  That being said, there are other games I would pull off the shelf before this one; indeed, there are other GameMaster titles I would pull off as well.

Still a Classic.  Our group likes 4 player better than 5:  just divide Russia between the other two Allies.  Also like using a lot of the other House rules like 2 hit battleships, revised Tech Tree, destroyers, submarine escape rules, etc.   With the 2004 release, we generally don't play this much, altho the pieces come in handy!

The game is objectively better than a '5', but this rating reflects my permanent burnout on it. I have heard that the revised version truly does improve on it, and fix many of the things that led to the burnout. But even 15 years later, that still has no power to tempt me to try it.

Played lots of this in high school many years ago. Haven't tried any of the newer versions or siblings. Fairly average game, can become quite scripted with the same group of people over and over.

The game itself is very well done.  You get lots of great stuff in the box and the rules are solid.  The problem I have with the game is that it can potentially run forever.  There is about 4 to 5 hours worth of fun in the game and it can easily run quite a bit longer.

RATING: 7.5
An enjoyable and popular game with
a clean and easily learned system.

The standard first Milton Bradley edition
has excellent component quality, however,
the game is biased in favour of the Allies
and also fails to be either detailed enough or accurate enough as a simulation.

As examples of weak areas of game design or areas not well reflected in the game :

1 the Blitzkrieg method of breakthrough and
encirclement cutting off supplies of the enemy
Is completely absent from the game.

2 The economic valuation of many areas has no
relation to reality, with Africa being of unrealistically
substantial Economic value in the game.

3 The technology tree is a oversimplified and
Is subject to massive influence of luck where
Long Range combined with Heavy Bombers
can be devastating for those lucky enough
to roll these technologies.

4 Submarine warfare is not well represented
in the game.

5 Terrain is not well represented in the game
system and on the map where, tanks can readily
sweep though 1000 miles of desert or jungle
with no ill effects.

Axis and Allies is thus an enjoyable game
in the guise of being about WW2 but is
Merely a game devoid of anything more 
than merely an illusory semblance to Reality.

One of the first games that led me down the path. It's fun an engaging but the rules aren't overly complex so even younger people can play the game. It's marginally historically accurate, but enough to rouse interest to study the actual situation. The trouble with this game is similar to that of monopoly in that it takes FOREVER to finish and in most cases the winner is clear far before the end of the game. There is a moderate amount of luck involved but a novice player will consistently be smacked down by a more experienced player.

I like the more recent A&A:Europe better.  The map in this game, coupled with some of the rules (building your own production centers), makes for some really bizarre strategy.  I *hate* that Stalingrad is West of Moscow!  I don't require a simulation of WWII, but I like the historical tensions to be in place.  Seems like Japan has too much incentive in this version to gang up on Russia.

Kind of like Risk on steroids. The time is Spring, 1942. World War II is in full swing. One to five players take on the roles of the USA, Great Britain, the USSR, Japan and/or Germany and conduct full scale war on each other. With Germany and Japan acting together as the Axis powers, the three other team up as the Allies. Countries need to work together to defeat their common enemies, first purchasing units like infantry, tanks, warplanes, battleships and submarines to move and attack as needed.

Played this a lot in elementary through high school.Used to be able to set the board up from memory...I probably still could if I played another game. Not a game I would enjoy much with only two players anymore. But with a larger group and the time to spare, I'd definately play again. Players who get analysis paralysis will drag this game down.

A classic that was played often in my youth.  It suffers from victory conditions that don't end games that are clearly over soon enough.  Most games are 60-90 minutes longer than they need to be.  

I'm also not a fan of the fiddly plastic units.  This is a game that would be vastly improved by wooden cubes. 

I don't consider this a great game, and it never gets played anymore but it is largely responsible for getting me interested in board games.

In tracing my board gaming history, it goes kid games, monopoly, risk, then Axis & Allies.  I first found the game in Toys R Us following my 6th grade birthday and immediately fell in love with it.  It was by far the most strategic and complex game I had ever played and introduced me to the Gamemaster series of games.  While I now recognize how much the dice play a role in the game, I will always have fond memories of this game.

Here's a game I've played quite a bit. Fairly simple for a wargame with such a grand setting, and plays well whether the countries on either side are run by the same player or by multiple players.

Classic Ameritrash.  Love the dice rolling.  If not for the length and the possibilities of getting 4 other interested parties together, I would rate this higher.

I played this a fair amount back in my college days.  However, I was never as enamored with it as several of the others in our group -- I would generally prefer Risk.  It seems like every time we played back then, we ended up playing for 6  hours and then never really finished the game.  What did make it interesting is that one of our group had played enough that he would try unorthodox strategies just to see how they played out.  Often, he fared poorly.  My favorite nation to play was Japan.  [08/14/2007]

Ok so chance played a central role, but this was still my favorite board game of my teen years. The war miniatures were the best available at the time (a far cry from Risk's cubes) and they still hold their own in comparison to many modern war games. A & A offered the ability to simulate naval, air and land battles of the Second World War in a balanced, addictive, engaging manner. A & A matches were necessarily longer than most Monopoly games. I played countless matches against my cousins and friends, some games extending into the wee hours of the morning or held over until the next day. But everyone always had a blast and we'd relive the pivotal battles that led to victory and immediately contemplate our strategies for the next time. Truly one of the great war games of all time!

[50+ plays] If the Revised game hadn't been made, I would still be rating this classic an "8" or higher. But if you don't own this yet, then please buy the 2004 revised version by Avalon Hill instead. So much has been improved, and this classic game has become something even better.

Most recent play in early 2004 with Garrett in anticipation of the release of the revised version.

RATING: 7
Axis and Allies has two outstanding features. First, it succeeds remarkably well as a large scale strategic game of WWII. Second, even non-wargamers, are willing to play it. Its simplicity is also a drawback, however, as play can become somewhat stereotyped and ahistorical. There can be a lot of downtime too, especially when playing with people who take a long time to move. I still like the game, and I want to try the revised version at some point.

Loved it as a kid, but it got old.  Seemed like the strategy was the same each play, and it drags on forever.  The "or less" dice mechanic was thematic and so refreshing after playing Risk for years.

[BGCOLOR=#FF3300][COLOR=#FFFFFF]Wargame.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Wargame. I hear the revised/newer versions are better, but for the play time, I'd rather go with something more Euro like Struggle of Empires for a wargamery fix.

I think that this game is great.  Even though it does rely on the luck of the dice, it does add in the aspects of economic and militery strategy. Not quite a 10, but well worth buying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I got this as a present in 1986. I certainly liked it much more than Risk, but I feel abosultely no compulsion to obtain a copy today. In fact, it just isn't that memorable. Reading the rules to Struggle of Empires is more exciting to me than actually playing Axis and Allies. It's not that it's a bad game, there's just a lot of downtime and the play is pretty clunky compared to other offerings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Provided hours of fun as a teenager, but revisiting it as an adult I found it lost some of its luster.  Mainly this is because I find that games with predetermined set-up and turn orders have stagnant strategies.  Still, I must admit I still enjoy rolling all those dice.  I wouldn&#039;t mind it being brought to the table once or twice a year.

Average Light Dicefest (Wargame). Can be very luck dependent, especially in the first round, when you lose the important battles. As a 2-Player Game, I would rate it a 5, as a 5-Player Game, I would give it a 3, as there is too much downtime.

Probably the biggest game that I've played the most.  A natural progression from Risk, I played the old version and still love it.

There is a "right way" to play the factions in "Axis and Allies." Even when you play properly you just chuck dice and hope for the best. As soon as you're old enough to understand that you're old enough to move on to better games.

Hiding in some crawlspace or closet shelf at a family member's house I am sure.

After playing the updated A&A which is a 10 I modify orginal A&A to an 8.  The game has a few minor issues, but is still great.  I believe this edition is going out of print.

Perhaps my first major spend was on this game at a wopping £19.99 from WH Smith (Liverpool City Centre) in 1987. This was a great game to play with friends it was just a shame it took so long to play and we often would fail to complete a full game. This game is a classic monster dice rolling game.

My introduction to complex gaming and board gaming in general (outside of the usual Monopoly/Risk/Candyland group).

My Dad owned this game and I would always take it out when I was young, in awe of its epic size and all the bits.

I finally got around to playing it when I was old enough to understand it. Played it once. It took a full day. Loved it. Never got around to playing it again due to how long it takes to learn and play. If I had the time and a motivated group, I would never turn down this game.

I must admit I like all the bits, the nice board, and the ensuing dice-fest.  I don't like the inordinately long setup and play time.

I'm one of the few people I know who just doesn't care for this game.  It requires a fairly lengthy setup, and--with the full complement of players--there's quite a bit of down time between turns.  I like the detailed miniatures and the combat mechanics.  I also love the idea of using stacks of chips instead of cluttering up the board with too many pieces.  In spite of those aspects this game just doesn't click for me though.  If I'm going to play a war game I prefer Samurai Swords or Risk ...

Is a fun game to play. Pros being the relative depth remaining a simple game, as well as nice set of rules with few contradictions. Cons are that it might be a bit repetitive, and that the first few turns is really decisive (and somewhat random due to the dice rolling). Bad play there (especially for the Axis powers) might make the game lopsided and no fun to play. When the a game gets really even it's a fantastic experience where all decisions matter.

Playing it blind is a great way to enhance the game, if you got two boards and possibly a volunteer to be referee.

One of the classic games of my life, anyway. I can't tell you the number of times I've played this game - at least 50.

I'd reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys wargaming.

RISK in WW2? A&A is a pretty shallow game; but has the advantage that it can be picked up very easily by new players. The standard rules minimize decision making, as there are often only a few viable strategies to follow; presumably the more advanced editions improve on this problem.

Takes too long.  I'm sure it's a good game, but I just can't get into it.  We always play with five players and there is major down time.

Still the best version of it. Loved it as a teen. All the new Editions added to much complexity with unnessesary new unit types and victory conditions to a simple "dudes on a map" game, that took allready to long in this version... Gets two extra stars for the sweet memories!

We rarely play A&A. Maybe once every 2 years??? We need to set aside a specific day and say, "OK, we're going all night with this". The problem is too much downtime and endless rules arguments because of the millions of rules supplements that have been released over the years. Just play.

So many great memories of this game growing up.  I had played this recently, and beyond nostalgia, it's got some merit, but it's very scripted in some of the things that happen every time.  

At least the openings, after you get some casualties one way or the other, plans change.

RATING: 7.5
Good strategy/war game, however tends to follow the same course. After you've played it a couple of times you know your role with each country. The late game can be interesting however as each of the winning side goes for the individual win.

My first wargame. Found it in a dumpster and instantly snatched it. Takes too long though and getting 4 more people to play it AND sit down for at least 4-5 hours is pain. It's also way to random and way to "coarse" in its scale.

Many fond memories of this one. Play can be somewhat predictable but the dice can make it interesting. I think I must have minored in this one at college.

RAW the game is broken and the Axis should not win. I once won a bet on this, the other player conceding after 4 turns. Some persons told me to play by the tournament rules, but I am not interested in this type of game anymore. The only way for the Axis to win is for Japan to go all in on Russia. It becomes a race with an advantage to the Allies and the best die rolls winning.

Sold at Pacificon 2012.

I played this ages ago and I remember it being some what enjoyable but I wasn't a fan of the lack of freedom within it.  Theres certain "Absolutes" that I recall loathing in the strategy.  I hate in games which are supposedly strategic where you MUST follow a cookie cutter mold if your going to win.  Wouldn't consider it a bad game however, there was depth hidden there that games like risk lacked.

What can I say about this game, it's complicated, the rules is very long, it takes forever to play, just the set-up and explanation requires about an 1 hour, not a game you'll play with a casual gamer. Clear out your agenda for this game cause it takes a while to finish it. A bit like Risk on steroids, the tactics make it interesting very accurate to the WWII and each country has it's strengths and weaknesses. I've played it a few times and my qualm with it, and it's a big one, is that the game is set-up in a way that's it's almost impossible to win as the Axis. Once the Allies start ganging up on you and your Germany... it takes a lot of skill and plays to win as the Axis, and that I find a bit too challenging, and I can never find anyone to play this game with.

It's big, it's clunky, it's classic. You have to be ready for a long, drawn-out war when you play this one, but it can be very fun. It can also be very long, which is OK if everyone stays interested. That's not always the case with A&A. After playing, you usually need to put it away for a while before you want to try that again.

I used to like RISK. Then I played ASL a few times. Too complicated, but RISK was never worth it anymore. So I got this. Had a LOT of fun with it, but it takes too long to play ... 
Either you play a "standard" opening, and then it all depends a bit on the dice (and the initial attacks of Germany, which are game-deciding)
Or you play an "interesting" opening, but then it is possible you lose a couple of hours only to find out this opening does not work ... meh

This is the game that introduced me to gaming beyond the standard family game. I was 10 when I recieved it and did not know how to play. I played dozens of games in the 1980s and 1990s.

It's not a bad game, just real complicated! Especially if you are use to playing Risk or even some of the other games in the GameMaster series. 

I know how to play the game perfectly, but trying to coax new players in & having to teach them the rules of the game can be difficult. 

The setup time can take awhile and you'll run out of room on the board quickly with all the pieces. (that's including the red/white chips also!)

The game easily takes 3-4 hours & that is if everyone already knows how to play. Also, use Poker chips to keep track of your money, (Similar to Conquest of the Empire with the coins!) it's much simpler than having to write it down each turn.

I prefer Conquest of the Empire over this. But it can still be fun if you can find dedicated players!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A pretty good wargame.  Definitely a step up from Risk, with more strategic options, more balance, and more control over the outcome.  Yes, there is luck involved, but if you play the odds right, and in such a way as to ensure sufficient time to recover from chance swings, they will usually come out in your favor.  It's a bit long for me, but the popularity of the game makes it relatively easy to find players.  The major downsides in my opinion are that you really want to have 5 players for it to work well and that it can drag a bit in the endgame.

Growing up with this game it has some great memories but to be honest the length of time it takes to play causes me to have a negative feeling towards it. Honestly it's a great game although i feel like this version had some sway for specific countries. I'd like to pick up the anniversary edition as i feel that it's a little more balanced. Ten years ago this game would have been a 9.5 or higher but time has brought it down a little and if it didn't have such a strong nostalgic feeling to it then i fear that i might rate it more in the 6.5 range.

Got nothing really against this game, and I think the mechanics work nicely and everything. But I still rated it 3.8. Basically because I'm not a major fan of war games and if I'm playing one I would much rather be playing something like Twilight Struggle or even A & A Battle of the Bulge. By and large, I cant really think of a situation where this would be my favorite game to play
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is always fun to play.  While almost always a twice sit down game due to it's longer length, you can really get into it.  There is some strategy but also some very reasonable luck as to many, many dice rolling.  This can really determine how the battle comes out and is sometimes not quit right.  This however, swings both ways.  Playing two players is great fun because you get to play more often as you play two or three countries.  Any larger and there are long down times though.

It depicts WWII on a grand scale, full global level. Up to five players can play on two different teams. The Axis which has Germany and Japan, and the Allies which has the USA, the United Kingdom, and the USSR. A full map of the world is provided, broken up in various chunks similar to Risk. The game comes with gobs of plastic miniatures that represent various military units during WWII. Players have at their disposal infantry, armor, fighters, bombers, battleships, aircraft carriers, submarines, troop transports, anti-air guns, and factories. All of the units perform differently and many have special functions. Players have to work together with their teammates in order to coordinate offenses and decide how best to utilize their production points. Players also have the option of risking production resources on the possibility of developing a super technology that might turn the tide of war.

RATING: 5.5
A decent, not great but not bad, team game of WWII, greatly simplified.

Its problems lie in play being a bit too stereotyped and Russia being a bit boring to play.  But still fun to explore.

Fixing these problems is problematic since they are really inherent in the historical subject matter.  If you introduce either A) Russia as a third side with its own victory conditions; or B) Axis instant win conditions; you're now in alternate history land. 

I've only played the first two (Nova and MB) editions.

QuarterMaster General has, imo, made A&A obsolete.

Not at all historical and a lot of luck. Try playing with minimal die by precalculating the odds.For example 6 attacks at 2 automatically equal 2 hits.6 attacks at 1 equal 1 hit etc.Odd amounts can be diced for or simply rotated

A classic that deserves it's status. Nethertheless, for me it got repetitive after a few games. It takes too much time for a game that is not very "heavy". But I like it.

I loved this game when I was a kid, so my rating may be a bit inflated.  If you've played risk this is a step up in complexity/strategy.  There are much better games like this out there I'm sure, but this is still a classic for a reason.

Axis and Allies has some cool stuff going for it. It is a huge improvement over the classic risk. I like that units can't do a never ending rampage, they have defense and attack stats (probabilities of killing another unit), the fact that one unit is extremely unlikely to do well against a hoard and the fact that both sides can lose all of their troops...in large numbers quickly. The thing that eventually turned me off on the game is that the setup never varies and there seems to be a few overarching strategies both sides must take to achieve Victory. Russia is likely to die quickly and it can be difficult to enter the battle as the Americans (if things don't go well at the start).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
An absolute classic!!! Some deductions though... luck of the die can become too influential and the real alternatives for action are not that great (for experienced players most of the moves are rather pre-designed -- they are the moves you absolutely should do). I personally acquired my second copy -- hoping to play a "double earth" game soon (two maps -- with axis on one board teamed with allies on the other and vica versa -- the maps next o each other -- making one map that is really long around -- one U.S. in the middle of the new board and the other split between the two extremes). I recommend either playing without the super-weapons or using Max's rules for them (see my comments on this playable expansion for Axis and Allies)

Sure, it's a beer and pretzels kind of wargame, and with a really aggressive style luck will be a significant factor. But for a reasonably light-weight game it does a good job of promoting mostly actual strategies of the war, and a significant skill difference will tell by the end of the game, 9 times out of 10.

I will always have a place for this game in my heart, this was the game that started the whole hobby/addiction/life goal. Sure it's not a new game and it is showing it's years but there is something to be said for rolling all ones and watching the vast German army on Moscows doorstep crimble.

Love this game.  Played it all the time as a teen.  Have only played it twice as an adult (mostly because its hard to find a full day to set aside to play it).  The game is too long for what it is...but there is a ton of nostalgia tied up in this game.  Not sure when or if it'll ever hit the table again, but I don't think I'll ever be able to part with this game. Game is complete with all 299 minis.

Low complexity strategic simulation of WW2 from 1942 onwards. A nice step up from Risk but is prone to drag on and on before victory conditions are met. Was fun over a summer during my teenage years (late 1980s) but I have no desire to revisit again.

Interesting and fun battle resolution mechanics, wide scale, good fun for 5 players, but it takes so long to get through that I'd rather play 3 other games instead. If the same mechanics were used on a smaller map with fewer pieces, it would be a much more fun game overall.

Axis and Allies is an old man talking about his hobbies. He takes a long time to set up the story, then goes on and on forever, and he has a lot of biases that are all too obvious. You listen politely for a while, but eventually you start wondering if he's ever going to stop. 

After a while the story is finished and you get ready to leave, but he keeps talking for another half an hour before you can get away from him. He might be an endearing old man, but he's not someone you want to spend a lot of time with.

This is the grand-daddy of every wargamer's collection.  In its day in my life, it was the ultimate game.  Will always be remembered fondly, but hardly ever played anymore.  Europe and Pacific are better games and I couldn't wait to play D-Day and the 2004 edition, but this whole franchise gets dustier by the day.  It just doesn't hold my interest since my collection has grown, both in quantity and in quality.  I love the theme and the idea, but all the dice rolls hit my pet peeve: too big of a random element.

RATING: 7
Classic light wargame.  Deep enough for sustained play.  It's very interesting to see the strategies evolve as a game group gets more familiar with the game.  Relatively easy to get into for a game of its length (~3 hours in my group).  I enjoy playing this in teams, because it leads to a lot of interesting strategic discussion.  If you're comparing this vs. the new editions at similar prices, get the new ones for the increased balance and optional rules.  If you see this one on the cheap, though, buy it,  because it's still a very good game.  It's relatively easy to convert it to the new rules, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great fun for 2, but long, long, long, and frankly with a very long, pointless tail.  If the Axis haven't taken over by the time the Americans land, it's done but for the shouting.  Do NOT mistake for a 5-player game.

In our one session of this so far, I played Germany, and I shook hands with the Japanese army in Moscow.  I love how the game works;  It's such an easy to play strategic wargame system.  Very intuitive and, dare I say, Elegant.  Risk has nothing on this.

A decent game.  Not balanced as well as it could have been, but still we had some good fun with it.  I preferred playing the naval powers.

RATING: 7
Cannot say how many weekends I spent playing this as a teenager.  It really taught me a lot about WWII and geography at a rudimentary level.  A&A encouraged me to learn more about the subject and also pursue heavier games.  

Due to its length and some design flaws (infantry stacking in Japan, etc.) it almost never hits the table anymore.  But I will always remember this game fondly.

I love this game. I don't currently own a copy because I haven't felt the need to re-purchase it since discovering gamesbyemail where I can play a game with competent players anytime I want in my browser (hit me up if you want to learn the game or try it out).

I will never turn down a game of A&A and I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys strategy combat-themed games. 

Don't play if you don't like complex strategy or long games. 

In my opinion, the randomness of the dice do a great job simulating the randomness of battle. There is NOT too much luck in this game. Anyone claiming there is too much luck is naive and/or doesn't understand (or cannot successfully implement) the strategic concept of putting the odds in one's favor. A skilled veteran player will beat an average player EVERY time. That same skilled vet will beat a good player almost every time. There is definitely a learning curve just like there is with any game that requires a lot of skill and complex strategy. If there were too much luck, a player of below-average skill would be able to beat a very skilled veteran player...but that NEVER happens.

People who think the rules are overly complicated most likely have not played games with complicated rules. Nothing is overly complex, and all rules add a cool element of theme and have a good affect on strategy. The rules ARE complex and they take time to get a good grasp of, but nothing is superfluous or nonsensical. If you like light games, this game is not for you.

I do think the game is unbalanced in favor of the Allies the way it was originally designed. A few simple "house rule" variations have evolved and become standard within the A&A community that totally fix this problem and allow the game to start very fairly. Once that is achieved, the game balance is AMAZING in my opinion. The fact that geographic location, placement of units, and types of units can be so diverse and yet so balanced is pretty awesome.

Some people gripe about how the game experience is different for the different powers being played. I do recommend starting out 2-player to really experience the whole game (staring out with 5-player and being Russia probably will be a sucky experience). And I also recommend playing both sides of the game to understand the whole game. And I do wholeheartedly agree that the game experience is different for the two sides. This is part of what makes it so great! Since when is asymmetrical game play a bad thing? It seems to be all the rage these days. In this way A&A, to me, is a game that was way ahead of its time. Yes, it is dated, but it is still classic and incredible.

People who like complex games with a war theme and lots of strategy but who bag on A&A are most likely misunderstanding the game or are unwilling to retry the game if their initial naive strategic ideas didn't work out the way they had envisioned.

Not higher than 8 because the complex and tense nature of the game means I like to take a break now and then.

Doesn't hit the spot with me, like most Historical war-games. Seems extremely tedious; one could go to to town and buy a better board game, come back, and it still wouldn't be his or her turn. Progression constantly fluctuates. Neat pieces and battle system, but some of the Japan and Great Britain pieces are almost alike. But, it is an old game, and I know there are better versions.

RATING: 7
While the game is in essence unbalanced towards the allies and it is usually clear who will win after three turns I used to have a lot of fun playing this. The box is all damaged from the many times we pulled it out in it was always thrilling to try new strategies. Will still play this and enjoy it as well, but it would not be my first choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very interesting.  It tries to keep it historically accurate by forcing pregame unit placement.  Most of your units are on the board already and additional unit placement can be very tedious.  The combat system is unique, but also tedious.  I guess it keeps you organized by taking the active units and pulling them off the board onto the "combat board."  Then you have to place all of the surviving units back on the map board.  One of the more unique and large scale wargames I have played

Once played a long time ago. I can see the nice mechanics, but the time you need to play a whole round is to much for expecting that it will appear soon on the table. One game is no reason for a rating, but I expect it to rate it a 5 or 6 with the background that it's an old game.

This was my first foray into wargaming, or at the very least, my first step away from family style board games. Thirty years later, It's easy for me to see that A&A is just Risk with a more complex battle system. Of course, when I first was getting into the hobby, I was pretty excited to find out that games like this even existed. The guys I played with were your typical Junior High gang, which meant that any game that took longer than an hour to play had less than a 5 percent chance of actually being completed. In other words, I've started way more games of A&A than I have actually completed. It's still a very important game to me though, and to this day I have a hard time avoiding games with big sprawling maps and hundreds of little toy soldiers (or space ships, or orcs, etc...).

Axis and Allies is responsible for making me into the red-blooded Ameritrasher that I am today. And for that Larry Harris, I salute you!

Axis and Allies is a damn fine wargame.  It's, IMO, the logical next step when you're looking for a multi-player wargame with a little bit more "meat" than Risk.  Suffers from scripted play with experience.  Update 2/18/17: it appears I gave my 1984 (?) copy of this game to charity.  Update 3/15/17: Lowered rating from 7 to 6, as I'd much rather play A&A Global.

The theme is always appealing...WWII...The rules are relatively simple and can be explained quickly. There are lots of large miniatures which appeal to new players. It's Axis vs Allies so no time lost in intricate diplomacy between players. It's simple and elegant AND it can be played 1 on 1 which is an added plus. When I'm out of players I can always slug it out with my bro in our basement. I have the old copy but I have been told that the new one has some really cool adittions.

I have always and will always love this game. I am biased, because it was my first strategy/war game. I was instantly in love with the plastic pieces and to this day favor them over chits. Hell, I learned more about world geography from this game than in school. Have played it countless times using various house rules and scenarios. Playing it with the normal rules I believe it heavily favors the Allies. The games tend to turn into slugfests on the Eastern Front (which Germany usually loses). It's still fun to be the Axis though, and try to rewrite history. I now favor other editions over this one, but will always cherish it for nostalgic, sentimental reasons.

Classic, but outdated now.  A&A always needed two things: more variability in the setup, and a finite endgame (probably via a timer of some sort).  Further iterations have tried to do a little along those lines, but not enough.

Still, a fun game back in the day when there weren't many comparable games.  Easily exceeded by most of the other Gamemaster games on pure gameplay grounds, but it is a fun theme, to be sure.

A great game that's been made obsolete by its even better revisions.  I scrimped and saved for this monster when I was 14 and have a lot of fond memories playing it with one of my best friends back in high school.  I played even more games solo, spreading it out across my (tiny) bedroom, on my desk, my dresser, and a couple TV trays.  

The revised edition from a few years ago is awesome and the anniversary edition is even more so.  Jason has both and I can't imagine playing my dingy old copy again.

I can't bear to rid myself of such a well-loved game, however, so A&A is now my "game design" box.  In addition to its own extremely useful bits, it's filled to the brim with other bits I've collected to use in prototypes and give me ideas.  A very fun way to retire an old favorite.

dice, dice, dice. Just a slight step up from Risk. I'm being a wee bit unfair here with only that to go on, but it really doesn't have a lot of depth to it, it's buying units according to the territory you hold, then using concentrations of them in battles to gain more. Different unit types hit based on their die rolls with slightly different success rates in ratings that have little or nothing to do with reality. The neat thing is playing with little plastic miniature pieces even if there is no scale involved at all, since that really isn't what this is about.

Classic game that I have always enjoyed more than Risk, although Risk does allow for much better variation in setup. Whoever is Russia may not be too infatuated with the game as it is the weakest nation in terms of strategic options, as there is basically 1 dominant strategy (unless the dice gods favor you).

Most fun global Axis and Allies game. Great step up above risk, was my gateway game. You just have to enjoy it as a game and not compare it to actual WW2. Easy rules, very balanced (with the official optional rules in play), enough luck to keep a new player in the game and enough strategy to give long time players enjoyment.

Was an old favorite in my youth,at least the original form, but it always ends up being a grudge match in russia, and Germanies only chance is to get some great dice rolls, otherwise the planes from britain and the infantry from russia will chew it all up. Japan can have an effect in taking out russia, but they give up all their sea possessions to the US. This one has run out of steam though and now it sits on the shelf waiting, waiting, waiting...

RATING: 10
This is a game from my childhood that I still love to play and will play any change I get.  I have friends that have played this game just as long.  We still enjoy playing together.  Each time one of us thinks we have an unbeatable strategy, the other finds a way to break it.  It keeps going back and forth regardless of what we try.  It is a pretty unforgiving game.  If you make a few mistakes early in the game, it can cost you the game.  But if both people are on point, it is often a very balanced game right to the end.  One of my favorite games and has stood the test of time as far as I am concerned.

This is die rolling game... lots of them.  Some people don't like the luck aspect that brings, but I think that is what makes the game so repayable.  It makes is less scripted than games where there is less luck.  It still has enough tactics and strategy that luck isn't going to save you if you don't play ahead, anticipate your opponents moves, or fortify your critical positions.  

Axis players have to play a bit more on the loose side.  Time is on the allies side.  A slow axis player will lose to a slow ally player more often than not.  Too aggressive of an axis player will lose even faster.  There is a critical balance between attacking and fortification that makes this game so great.  Luring your opponents troops out of a region, creating multiple fronts for them to defend, etc.  All kinds of great strategic moves that can be planned and played out over a few rounds that can alter the outcome of the game.

My only problem with this game is finding people to play it...

This was my brothers game growing up and he played the hell out of it with his friends, and therefore was MUCH better at it than I was.  The few times I played against him I was crushed quite fast as I didn't know the basic strategy.  I did however love all the bits.

I've only played this a handful of times, but always liked it.

It requires a lot of setup time, takes a long time to play, and really requires a certain mindset to enjoy, so finding other people willing to play can be exceptionally difficult.  This hasn't hit the table in well over 10 years and although I would greatly enjoy playing it again, it will probably be at least another 10 before that ever happens.

RATING: 7
Honestly, I bought it back during the first Clinton administration and I've just never gotten past the 40-minute setup.

My oldest kids are getting close to the right age, though, so someday soon...

In the mean time I content myself with reading about this war.

---UPDATE:  Well, the decade-and-a-half parenting wait has paid off: I finally played my first game with the 15yo last night. She concluded it was the most boardgaming fun she'd ever had, and I thoroughly enjoyed it myself.  It will definitely be coming out again soon.

Less complicated than I feared.  In fact *just* complicated enough for a theme; my personal preference is for abstraction, but I enjoyed the history a lot.  Granted it's not "accurate", but the names are there, a smattering of representative economic and military values are there, and the combat sequence and development procedures bear *some* interesting statistical relationship to reality.

So you can't resist the fun of musing on the issues of the time while you're rolling your infantry dice against your enemy's bomber.  ...I can tell you I totally broke that loud-mouthed Churchill's resolve last night!  Lucky for the rest of the democratic world Stalin swept through the Eastern front right afterward...

I played this game a lot when I was first introduced to it back in 1989.  I've always loved the feel of a strategic wargame with the tactile feel of cool little plastic figs.

However, after a while I found the game's high luck factor, combined with the feel of a single path to potential victory for each side caused the game to lose some lustre.  I also found the potential of a single game to consume an entire day to be a bit of a daunting time expenditure, and there is way too much downtime for all other players while one player plots out all of his moves.

I still play it for nostalgic reasons occasionally, but most of my other games are better and more enjoyable.

[b]OLD-SCHOOL FUN.[/b]

A classic wargame with basic rules and a bucket of plastic pieces. Be prepared to roll hundreds of dice if you're going to have a heavy session of this!

I have had many a sunday afternoon playing out WW2 through this game, and all of them were a joy; that said, I haven't opened the box in 18+ years.
In all of our games we have never seen the Axis powers win. Once they came very close, when a friend of mine, David, played the Germans with a cold, ruthless hand, only to be let down by the Japanese player failing to secure India, etc, in the crucial opening stages.
Each time, we also gave the Axis the power of jets and super subs, but the result was the same: defeat at the hands of the Allies! Jolly good thing too.
A&A takes a long while to play; this is one of the reasons why it does not surface on game nights around these parts...

Yes there are all sorts of balancing problems that could be remedied in different ways, and the play time can drag on, but "LOOK AT ALL THE DICE YOU GET TO ROLL THIS IS AMAZING" says teenage Matt.

The revised edition fixes some problems with the lack of fluidity and options on the Russian/German front, but the game still isn't quite as varied in the strategies you can win with as I'd like. Against competent Allied defense, it comes down to whether or not a somewhat reckless early Axis expansion will get good dice rolls or not. Otherwise, the relentless American economy makes for a quick time limit on Axis ambitions.

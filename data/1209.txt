A diamond in the rough. Played twice with a group of 6 and 8 players respectively, both times have been great fun, mostly, it seems, due to the diplomatic aspects of the game. It suffers from several jarring issues, but manages to offer intriguing gameplay regardless. The bookkeeping is alleviated with an excel spreadsheet, but still slows the game to a crawl and extends playtime significantly, because we must collectively to wait for one player to plot all the changes on the map into the spreadsheet. We subsequently discussed using a Google-spreadsheet (or whatever it is called) to allow everyone to individually plot in their advances, which might speed up everything. 

Secondly, the power assymetry seems to be artificially bolstered by the victory point divisors used to buy VP's at the end of turn. Poor Belgium are treated with cascades of points for basically doing nothing in their final turns. This isn't a problem of balancing per se, but a necessity that leads to rather dull gameplay. Playing as Russia, it quickly became apparent that you are locked in to a few spaces of operations, after which victory can only be assured by either provoking (or sneaking into a war with clever (or lucky) diplomacy) or waiting the rest of the game out by buying VP's with Russia's juicy £2.5 VP price. After I had taken the keys in Russia's sphere of influence, it was all down to waiting for the VP's to trickle down or a war to break out that would allow me to take positions from my belligerent neighbors. The latter didn't happen and the former neither because the Russian income couldn't compete.
Our American player complained similarly of the lack of unrest produced, particularly in South America. This is another game element that seems to shoe-horn the players into particular playstyles - in our most recent game, very few unrest markers were rolled, so the particular playstyle in question was really not doing much at all. Obviously this is due to unfortunate rolls, but it nevertheless underlines how luck dependent and limited the players can be. Our American, however, won the game by a landslide, again partly because of two Yellow Journalism events and a subsequent war of Spanish eradication. 

Despite all this, Pax Britannica retains the beauty that some grand wargames in, my opinion, tend to have, namely that quality of transcending it's "game-ness" and becoming more about the story and the experience. One is not miffed at having lost a game of Pax Britannica, but rather happy to have participated, despite the temporary frustrations that occur. 

Pax Britannica is a fun game worth playing at least once with a band of good friends. Conclusively, I hope that a second edition will one day emerge. I don't know if the utopian Pax Britannica game that I dream of is doable in a second edition or if it should be a wholly different game altogether, but there is a spark in Pax Britannica's system of diplomacy and strategy that deserves to live on.

RATING: 6
Fun game with the right crowd.  There were some great moments negotiating.  The problem is that it isn't balanced, and it's Britain's game to lose.  I don't see how the other players can consistently even out the odds.  I think that you need to go into this with the mindset that you're playing it for the experience, not to win.  It is one of those games where I replay the game in my mind, thinking about things to do differently the next time, which is always a good sign.

A lot depends on how random events come out.

There are not a lot of free wheeling diplomacy games.  I think that it's better than Civilization or Diplomacy.  Pax Romana remains my favorite of this type, but it's only 4 player.

We played with 6 taking 7 hours.  There would not have been much for Italy to do.

This isn't a wargame, the combat is uninteresting.

This is a very thematic game.  The Great Powers are involved in a world wide power struggle complete with secret aggreements, bickering and backroom dealing.  Its a truly unique game and with the right group its an amazing experience!  

That said, a lot of the mechanics are broken, the ending is anti-climatic and there is alot of record keeping for the bigger powers.  Its definitely worth playing with the right group, the more the merrier.  Try to get at least 5 players.

It requires too many players and takes too much time. While beautiful, the map is too damn big. Combat is odds-based and is pretty much an all-or-nothing affair (no making change for damage). Russia is a bore to play, while Britain is a headache to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Masterful club game of diplomacy and empire-building. I think this one still sets the standard for 19th Century empire-building games. Each Great Power (and there are several for players to choose from) has a set of victory conditions tailored to their relative power in the game that offers a nice balance to play. For example, Britain has a staggering burden to carry to achieve victory. But then, they are staggeringly powerful nation in the game. Japan, extremely weak by comparison, has very modest aims. Beware of fighting and projecting to much force: combat between large forces can be ruinous and keeping large armies flung across the world can be very expensive.

Lots of bookeping, but a proper sheet for writing the numbers down and poker chips are a big help.

This one never seems to live up to its potential, and the math is tedious.  A computer version might be fun, though.
Even though the scoring is balanced, the gameplay isn't -- what France and England do will have far more influence on the game than what Russia and Italy do.  I believe that Italy can win simply by putting down Interests and Influences, and avoiding any possibility of conflict, which seems cheesy.

Absolutely fascinating take on Victorian geo-politics which looks at the struggle of the great powers on a world scale - with most of the complexity and counter density that implies!  Players' resouces and capablities vary enormously, in line with C19th reality, which is compensated for by the victory point dividers but makes the game rather less interesting for those playing the lesser powers.

RATING: 4
I used to refer to this game as Diplomacy for adults - a game that is mainly one of diplomacy, and yet has the texture, shades of gray, and give-and-take of the real world. Which is cool. However, along with that comes some real-world problems, crucially that the weaker nations (realistically, everybody but France, England, and *maybe* Germany) have relatively little influence on the game as a whole, and their part just isn't that interesting. Also, it's too long - if could be played in half the time, especially considering the boredom issue, it would be much better. And the weird triangular counters were a serious usability issue. And there is a lot of spreadsheeting. I'd be kind of curious to play this again, but no question it had issues.

RATING: N/A
I dislike committed negotiation phases (ala Diplomacy). 

I dislike paper record keeping (in this game a player's economic sheet looks like a weekly profit & loss statement for a small retail business -- more work than fun).

I dislike simultaneous placement of military, economic and political pieces (ala ... well, I've never come across this poor design choice before).

If you like the above, you'll dig this game.

:coffee: :( :( :( :) :) :) :D Dripping with theme in a way you can only achieve in a game much improved by having a handy laptop running Excel to help with the vast amounts of record keeping in a game that takes what seems in retrospect to be an unfathomably long period of time. Feels a bit like someone dared the designer to create a Diplomacy variant that actually simulates the Great Power dynamics that led to the actual First World War; be careful what you wish for, I guess. Having said that, it IS a compelling game underneath all of the double-entry bookkeeping, and the theme is one that I am fascinated by, and it really does force you to make choices with realistic-feeling repercussions and rewards, and had I a copy of this game and six friends willing to devote the time, and a place to play all day free from feline board interference, and the aforementioned laptop running Excel, I would relish the opportunity, which is not something I can say of most board games of the Strictly Built 4 Hardcore Gameaz period of the 80s-90s.

Sure, the rules are a perforated, leaky mess. Yes, an experienced and sober British player will win most of the time. True, some Powers (Russia, Japan) have little to do except hope that some lucky events will allow them the opportunity to surge forward. This is the *best* game of negotiation set in an historic milieu, a political game with victory or defeat primarily determined by economic standards. The requirement that one have a legitimate Casus Belli to threaten war, and the intricacy possible in the drawing up of treaties by the players, makes evaluation and negotiation the requisite skills for success.

Fascinating game that adds a global view and economics to &quot;Diplomacy,&quot; but is missing a few crucial mechanics to make it all cohere completely.  With a group of like-minded players, it can be a good game, but it&#039;s extremely sensitive to the &quot;one jerk can ruin everything&quot; syndrome.
Ultimately, the game just isn&#039;t quite as much fun as it seems it could be, and it goes on a bit too long.

War is inevitable. We probably screwed up the game play of this one in a big way the one time I played it. Still, willing to play again.

We were muddling through the game, but the end was just classic as Russia (as an NPC due to random event) declared war on Turkey, pulling in Germany, France and Austria due to various treaties and the poor British player throwing his arms up in disgust as none of those involved would break their treaties to prevent the war. Thus World War I started.

I had fun analysing the empires but I'm not convinced that the game is sufficiently balanced.  The game, which is a long game by today's standards, must be played right through to the end as the final VP round for controlled areas at the end of the game is critical to the outcome (eg otherwise it wouldn't be worth the British player holding on to various parts of their empire as they effectively get nothing for them during the course of the game).

Pax Britannica is a very enjoyable game for those players who enjoy empire building, diplomatic, and colonial-era war and strategy games. Among some circles it is called “Diplomacy, on steroids”, as in addition to its strong element of negotiations, it incorporates a true economic system, and a combat-resolution system, both absent from that classic strategy game. There is also a very active online play-by-email community, for those who love the game, but cannot get enough players to all sit around a table long enough to play a game. 

I truly enjoy this game, and highly recommend it.

The main thing making this fun for me is playing with all seven players; "the more the merrier" holds true here and helps me overlook, for the length of the playing, what I don't like about it. What I don't like is its abstraction; I feel like I'm trying to manipulate the system and just set pieces down instead of reliving history (for much the same reason I heartily dislike the COIN games). There's some fun, especially when the Chinese go up, but, for me, not quite enough. The administration/bean-counting is overwrought. The charts and pads work, but, at times, what a pain in the wherever. The triangular military units and hexagonal control markers are awkward to handle. I wish the colorful map could be made a little larger (have the random events table elsewhere and put the treasuries on mats similar to Here I Stand in order to free up more illustration space), then have 5/8-inch circles for all four modes of control and 5/8-inch squares for military units and other markers. It'll take us a while to figure out to cut down Britain's lead, and there are just too many other games to play in the meanwhile. It's a war of accountants.

Pax Britannica combines elements of politics, economics, and war in a simulation of the struggles among the imperial powers during the years leading up to the Great War. It's a fascinating and wholly original game, although the execution is uneven and somewhat cumbersome.  The rules for allocating your money each turn desperately need revision/clarification.  It's currently done as a kind of free-for-all, but some players may want to wait to see what other will do, creating a stalemate situation.  Also, I think the military aspect of the game is in need of some serious streamlining.  With a careful and extensive overhaul, this could be a great game.

Game of 19th century colonial empire building. Too long, too fiddly, combat rules too primitive (the old-style DE/EX/etc combat results chart doesn't become more streamlined or realistic just because you color code it), yet there is still much to like in this game. In particular, I like the fact that it is basically a colonization game, with war only being an optional phase in the course of the turn. I like the fact that you can't just attack whomever you like, you have to have a valid casus belli.

There needs to be a ranking for games that are fond memories, but aren't ever going to be replayed. This is one. My crew of players just aren't going to spend the time or energy required to get this game off the ground. Diplomacy is dead, metagame speaking. And any game longer than two hours is an epic. It's all short-attention-span multi-player-solitaire, then go home to spend ten hours binge-watching the latest AdventureTimeRickyAndMorty mashup.

So, my rating is more recollection than reality-based, but I do have many fond memories of this game. Heavy on the bookkeeping and definitely imbalanced (for historical reasons), it often came down to just how diplomatic Britain could be.

Almost bought this game but the multiplayer aspect deter me from doing so.  At that time, it was difficult to find a player for a 2-player wargame session, not even to mention a number of players who can be interested in the subject at the same time.  So the idea of buying it dwindles.  Now, I want to collect it as a self-resumption of the regret.  In fact, it is a good production by Victory Games.

Near perfect - with caveats.  Excellent concept and play mechanics are let down by an "all or nothing" conflict system.  In the absence of a very savvy and vocal group of players there is nothing to stop a victorious nation from completely eliminating its opponents empire in a single war (viz Spanish American War).  Okay in reality, but makes for a very unfun game.  Also, the polar projection map is way too large to fit on most tables - they should have gone for the classic "classroom" Mercator projection - would have been smaller, looked better and given a more historic feel.  Apart from these quibbles I still consider this to be one of my favourite games of all times.

This game has a lot of interesting mechanics, especially the simultaneous scramble of placement.  I also like all the diplomacy and the complete freedom to make whatever treaty you want.  The book-keeping can be annoying, but Excel solves that.  The fact that every country places very differently makes it very replayable, and the VP-divisors keep everyone in the game.  I wish I had more long gaming sessions where I could get this one on the table.

Interesting asymmetric diplomatic/military/economic strategy game.  A unique design with a good historical feel.  

Didn't feel balanced (even with the VP multipliers) and the great disparity in political, economic and military power (though historical) of the player nations made for a dull game if you were stuck with a weak nation.

Might still be viable in the current gaming environment with some streamlining and updated mechanics (maybe even turn this into a CDG?).  And maybe updated rules to control the minor nations in the game.

A great theme and concept. I like the idea of assymetric player powers. Theme was chosen over player interaction in this game's design, resulting in Britain having the most to do (and the most fun) while the other powers (eg Japan, Italy) mainly just sitting and waiting for their rare opportunities to appear. Some of the rules are seriously broken. I wish a publisher would pick this title up, update it and review the rules.

RATING: 9
Great period game of multi-player diplomacy and expansion.  Math heavy and a bit cumbersome to set-up, but always playable in 8-12 hours (usually on the shorter side) which makes it a great game for a saturday afternoon/evening.  It is true that the bigger countries have a bit of accounting to do every turn, and the smaller countries have fewer options, but the thrill of the game comes in the negotiations and Congresses of Europe.  An Italian or Russian player who turtles and has "nothing to do" isn't playing right.  Every vote counts in the Congress of Europe.

In the end, it's all about color, and this game has color in spades.

Initally, the "buying victory points" idea (also seen in Empires in Arms) sounds good. But what is it supposed to represent? Just why does it cost Britain more per VP than, say, Italy, except to give the smaller powers an equal footing. This is not necessarilly bad, but the entire game depends on maximizing the amount of VP you can buy and actual Empires are of secondary importance. Ultimately disappointing.

RATING: 7
Good game on an interested subject.
It is easier to play than what I was expecting while reading the rules, with some nice and interesting mechanics.
Thus, it looks like the game is more interesting when played with 6-7 players.
With only four players, there is a lack of interactions.
And the US player is rather limited and waiting for a casus belli against the neutral Spain.
But, if you like this period, you must give it a try.

The calculations of the money generation and the administration sheet must have been designed by an accountant. It does drag the game.

Would definitely use the revised rules especially to lessen the desirability of using co-dominions,

Jason Matthews, co-designer of Twilight Struggle, says it best in own review of Pax Britannica on BGG: "A tragically flawed masterpiece. I'd like to see this modernized. Greg???"

This is a game that I rate an '8' due to flaws, but it wants to be a '10'. It really does. Of any game in my collection, this one probably hits closest to home for me. If only it wasn't so outdated. A great game marred by flawed and somewhat incomprehensible rules. You can navigate to greatness with some effort. I would give this game a '10' if it was updated to today's gaming standards and with clarified rules. I love the focus on diplomacy with warfare being a secondary aspect. There is so much to like, and so much to frustrate. This game needs to be re-released as a second edition with newer game mechanics and much simpler processes.

This game has been one of my favorite multi-player games. With the right group it can be a lot of fun, especially by letting the less experienced players control the heavy-weight empires.

I like the mix of military and non-military options for area control, the pre-planning, the special VP conditions, and the ad hoc diplomacy that occurs.

The non-standard shaped chits are aesthetically not pleasing to me but I understand the attempt is for quick visual recognition.

The purchasing and the use of a ledger may throw some off but it is not that difficult and is easy to get used to.

I like the alternate history that occurs in the game - without the reality becoming a total fantasy.

All said it for me it models the "Great Game" rather well.

It looked like the real deal. The rules sounded like the real deal. The game itself was rubbish.

No you move.' Nobody moved.

The theme is absorbing, the scale is huge, but the rules are a mess. However, I just love this game so much I have re-written the rules twice!! Through the Pax Britannica online community a lot of games have been played and as expected, Britain wins most of the time. Japan wins fewest games but I have reduced the divisor and it's still hard for the Far Eastern power to win. If you like balanced games where everyone gets the same chance you won't like this game; messing around with divisors doesn't help either but quite simply, the longer the game goes on the more balanced the game will become for those who have avoided losing any war with another player. The point of the game is to recreate the 30+ years building up to World War I so balance isn't an issue for me, it's the historical purity and the diplomacy that are the attractive characteristics.
Face-to-face play is a long drawn out affair, so best to play it over a period of time via email with a moderator (I have moderated 12 games). 

My own re-re-re-design looks a lot different to the original. Gone are the maths, the separate war phase, European and Chinese Tensions, rebellion and in comes a more intuitive player led tension building with more emphasis on investment, commercial interests and more focus on Europeon conflict in the event of war. {Update - Nov 2013} Never did go further with this - lost the desire for game design - maybe something for the future!
(Update Feb 2016 - keep looking at that map I have designed and it is crying out for some effort to design the game around it...)

Classic negotiation game with loosely structured timings that will dismay the modern gamer. Me, I don't mind that, but for some reason I didn't draw as much enjoyment as I would have hoped.

Comes with Costikyan's outspoken, and sort of idealist, apology of the Victorian times of yore (to the point that the rules are punctuated with Kipling's verses).

I wish Greg Costikyan hadn't followed the money into computer games...Some of the most interesting games came from him and I'd love to see what he would design 20 years on.

Anyway, PB is a game that always seemed great but delivered less than it promised.  The political system, like all rigidly codified political systems in games, gets "gamed" itself by the players until it's an awkward appendage.  And we may have been playing the game wrong, but I seem to remember that wars all came down to having the largest fleet, and then slowly moving it around and crushing all your opponents and taking their colonies.

The random events were also incredibly meaningful in the game.  I remember one game where two states next to Germany had problems in the first turn, and the Germans went in and established protectorates right away.  Everyone puttered around doing their things all game, and at the end of the game we discovered that the Germans (who had done little else all game) had won by a wide margin thanks to their two properties in their back yard.  Shame on us, but something like that would never be considered good design today.

Still, it's another game that I wish I'd gotten a chance to play more.  Interesting system, lots going on, an admirable attempt to model a tricky period in world affairs.

This is my favorite theme and I wish there were more attempts at it. I would like to see a simplified version where I don't have to do the British bookkeeping.

As a kid I saw this game at a store and wanted it because it had a world map with Austria as playable. I didn't remember the name of the game and for some reason misremembered the map as being Supremacy-like.

...In my idle moments I keep trying to reduce this game to its basic elements. I think that the vast player asymmetry and the randomness is what keeps the game (specifically the fairness of some deal or division of assets) from being too calculable.

So, if you removed that (but left, say, the differing overlapping spheres of influence of the players) I [i]think[/i] the game may be primarily about two things: 1. Extortion, or games of chicken, where you threaten to start WWI and tank you and your opponent both if you don't get what you want. 2. Balancing military spending with VP purchases, so that you have enough military to stand up for yourself but not so much that you're just wasting money.

If I'm right about this then #1 is actually problematic as far as my actual taste in games goes. That kind of game-ending and game-losing decision has to be implemented in such a way that the player making it doesn't know for sure that he is, because I consider it bad form to knowingly end a game in your own loss.

[Calandale's playthrough/review brings up the good point that being able to merely take a chance on starting the Great War probably makes it much more likely that the game will end that way, and early.]

...Bothers me a bit that the general strategy advice for some player positions (e.g. Britain wanting to end the game as soon as possible while weak powers want the game to go long so that they can build up VPs) is completely an artifact of the design and doesn't simulate anything.

Obstinately warty and old-fashioned, but thematically perfect.  Five different political statuses, with extremely complicated relationships and economic implications, and a whole phase of the game for pen-and-paper accounting are the most obvious relics from another era of game design.  All of this makes this game a beast to explain and internalize.

The granularity isn't all bad though.  It leads to the most historically accurate and thematically rich treatment of this theme that's out there.  The game captures the the colonial squabbling and brinksmanship of the period, as well as the unequal relationship between the colonial and noncolonial nations.  The designer's views on colonialism espoused in his notes are definitely awkward and outdated, but nonetheless the game captures the behavior of the powers perfectly.  There's no sugarcoating here -- go forth, impose your political will, and if there's a revolt, use your superior technology and firepower to suppress it.

This is one game that is likely to go to my heirs. I just can't see parting with a game this good looking, that deals with such an intriguing period of imperial competition.  It's a wierd game, given the unique (in my experience) unstructured action phase that is at the heart of each turn.  I've never seen anything like it, and it drives me crazy.  The bookkeeping is no longer in vogue, and modern games find ways to make that easy. And the military and naval systems are a bit unsatisfactory, to say the least.  However, this is a potentially tense diplomatic game, in which brinkmanship is critical. It's got a lot of promise as a diplomatic experience.  And did I mention that it looks really really good, even after a quarter of a century?

Played it twice in 2011 face to face with groups of 5 and 6. The game still has charm and historical flavor, though the mechanics don't stand up to those in the best of the current games. But I played a game on the forums here at BGG in 2012, and that game really exposed flaws in the clarity of the rules, and in the system. Had to drop my rating, but still want to keep the game.

Fun situation. The game itself takes far too long while being prone to far too many players being locked in by the situation.

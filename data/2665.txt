Not a bad attempt at the topic but game play is a bit predictable in the multi-player version. Probably the only game I have played that works better as a solo game.

Surprisingly a very good game, you try to get the items you need for your faction to win and at the same time eliminate the opposition leaders.  Very Hard to find game.

It was a very interesting game.  Having forces on both sides and trying to determine which side you'll ultimately back can be a challenge for yourself let alone figuring out who you opponents will side with.  Politburo purges and assassinations spice things up as well and random events can throw everything off as well.  I've played this game four times and none of them have been remotely similar.

I am not an expert on the Russian civil war so I cannot vouch for how historically accurate this game is but I can tell you its a lot of fun...the assassins are a flat out hoot.

Tried playing this by PBEM once.  Excruciating, and of course extremely unbalanced to those who draw poor leaders. Sometimes a game can be very innovative, yet still a terrible game.  The idea of controlling forces of both factions (Red and White) and only scoring points for the winning side at the end sounds cool, except everybody knows Red is going to win.

A most unusual multi-player game. In this game each player can control units for several of the factions in the game. You choose, towards the end of the game, which faction you want to win depending on how you are doing. It leads to a lot of uncertainty regarding a player's loyalty to a faction.

SPI.  This is a fun multi-player style war game intertwined with politics. The game is very "bloody" as factions battle each other and kill each other off.  Will the REDS or the WHITES win?  I like this game with 4 players.  The game also plays in an evening.

RATING: 5
I like the idea of having to not just win, but win on the right side.  The game I played didn't use the politburo at all, but I can see that being really cool in future games.  I did not like the rule on only armies killed in the fifth round count for victory purposes.

RATING: 8
I have fond memories of this one, though the rules tend to go on and on in classic SPI style (I wrote a summary to avoid this annoyance). You've just got to love a game where you get to attack your own units.

Blast of a game on a extremely interesting conflict. Many unique design mechanics. With the right group, one of the most enjoyable muliplayer wargames. Game is not difficult to learn. A number of variants have been offered over the years. I was able to download a list on the RCW consimworld discussion board.

RATING: 3
This is essentially a solitaire game with little or no player interaction, diplomacy or strategy. Opponents more or less serve as random events in the chaotic Keystone Cops like knockout lunacy that thankfully only lasts five turns (albeit four more than most players will be able to stomach).

It took a lot of work to get this baby, but I enjoy every minute of it.  More abstract than most wargames, but it was a political war being simulated here.  Nice effort.

For the SPI edition.

I completely hate the new DG S&T edition counters with their cartoon looking combat figure Icon's.Hopefully someone will make new one's. otherwise a nice job on the rest of the graphics.I see this will not be played unless I use the original SPI counters.For the DG remake a 5 rating just because of the crappy counter art work.

The first game that I ever owned where players held units from opposing factions.  The victory conditions were such that either side could win... and points were awarded each player  depending on a 'Red' Russian or 'White' Russian victory.  The random turn order was a first for me as well... it stands out as one of the best multi-player wargames that SPI ever produced.

Mother Russia, when will you stop the struggle?  This is the definitive game on the subject before Triumph of Chaos. I hope that Decision Games could push this one higher on the reprint list from their vast ocean of SPI titles copyright. Again, the number interested in the subject might not prove there is an audience for a reprint. A game that I really hope there could be an update (note: the game is on the pledge program list).

Older game, but with some interesting concepts. It's the only game I know, where you will get VP's by attacking your own units (which are of course in another faction). For example one of your red leaders may attack one of your white leaders. Another intersting thing is the politbureau system. You can iniciate purges with the majaority of politbureau members, very nice. On the downside the all or nothing combat system is on my oppinion outdated. If Decision Games will republish this game, the Combat system shpuld be changed. So have an interesting multiplayer games with nice material, but somewhat outdated combat rules.

I like this game.  Probably better with more than two players.  Pretty wild, and hard to figure out what you should be doing but the map clears up quickly.  Kind of ahistorical but combat easy but unpredicotable but also fun.   Setting up quite arduous, as is the upkeep phase.

This is a very innovative game, in that the players do not associate with a single side.  You start with a mixture of red, white and other forces and you may start off helping red, then find that the situation has changed and suddenly you are a white supporter.  In the end game you may order your red units, into isolated, impossible possitions, so your white units can finish them off to get more victory points!  Beautifully captures the chaos of the Russian Civil war leading to the the Russian Democracy (which the Communists toppled 9 months later). 
  This is the ONLY game where their is a level of indirection between the player and which side of the conflict that person is playing.  For this to work, you NEED 3 players.  One of the most clever multiplayer games I've ever seen.
  No rating as I have not got any of my friends to sit down and actually play this one.  (Sigh...)

I played my first game in 2010.  This game seemed rather chaotic, although I guess that sort of fits the theme.  The stacking rules seemed a bit tedious for one thing, but perhaps I could get used to them.  The game play seemed unbalanced.  Most of my counters seemed to have almost completely disappeared from the board by game turn 2 or 3.  I played a five-player game that I think took about 4 hours.  Amertrash gamers might like it.  The map was neat.  I was hampered by not knowing very much about this period of history.

The plays are combined for 1st and 2nd edition - they are essentially identical, except for some small tweaks to the maps.  Great game, chaotic, fun - but the 2nd edition missed a golden opportunity to clarify some rules from 1st edition.

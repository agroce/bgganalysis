1st play: Very neat social interaction and deduction game. Stressful and fun as both dreamer and spirit. I like how you quickly decide who you trust and who you don't, and then trying to tell a story at the end challenges the memory in a fun, quirky way. Can't wait until this game reaches full distribution. 

No second play - Couldn't find it out in the wild.

Faeries wins 
Babau Lose
Sandman was there to make the Faeries victory more acceptable
The worst things is that cards, bed, mask etc are completely unnecessary
If the game runs word cards simple as codenames it would have been the same cause the dreamer could not look at the cards.
Dixit is ten galaxy far far away from this BE(A)D

Splendid artwork. 
The trickster makes the game really shines :D My gaming group very much enjoyed the game SO FAR. However, we needs more cards, at least double of them, seriously :) The low number of card really decreases the long term replay-ability.

I am not generally a great fan of party games: I sometimes like the occasional game of Dixit, Time’s Up or Concept, but they’re more about playing with my daughters or with non gamers than pure joy of gaming.
When I Dream, however, is a design I admire: so clever in a very Reposesque way!
I loved my first play, and I am looking forward to many more!

This game is a variant on dixit but it isn't so good because it's more complex. Not that it is difficult to play but it isn't as straightforward as dixit. You really need a good group to play this and sometimes discussions can happen with some words.

Combi van Dixit en Weerwolven... Who is playing the bad guy?
Engelse tekst, dus niet speelbaar met NL kinderen.

Leuk als de fairies op mekaar inspelen, idem voor de img's.
Origineel party spel waarbij heel wat gelachen wordt.
Leuk met 8, maar méér hoeft niet, denk ik.
Beetje weinig kaarten om lange tijd boeiend te houden?

RATING: 9
Inventive, quirky party game that takes Werewolf's "act based on your role" idea and turns it on its head. Good clues, bad clues, and in between- who are you and which kind of clue should you give? Quickly adjusting to your role is fun (it changes each round!). Being the blindfolded dreamer and determining everyone's intentions is fun. Dream-telling aspect adds goofy improv to the formula, which is fun. Just fun, fun fun.

We played this at Alice and Luke's New Year's Eve party. I was surprised that the group was quick to get the idea of the game.

It's a lot easier to be a fairy - good clues are easy to figure out. It takes a little more time to figure out "bad" clues - by the end of the game (10 rounds) the bogeymen were figuring out what to do.

I think it's a solid party game. Would like to play it again with a different group to see.

Für den Träumer kann es bei guten Tippgebern verdammt schwierig sein die Extrapunkte abzugreifen. Genauso kann es aber auch Taktik sein eben nur wenig Begriffe überhaupt zu erraten um die Punkte dann doch zu haben und dem Rest wenig Punkte zu geben. Das Spiel schwimmt im Kielwasser von Dixit und Mysterium. Ich würde es nochmal mitspielen. Es ist aber  nichts was ich vorschlage oder gar kaufen würde.

Clearly not not a game for me which comes as no surprise since I loathe most of the party/communication type of games. Considering this, a rating of 3 is actually pretty good since "likely won’t play this again" means I could be convinced. 
What annoyed me way more than the game itself was Repos' promotion for the game at SPIEL'17 in Essen: 2 guys dressed in nightgown etc. would lay down pretending to sleep in the middle of the super crowded passages of the fair, blocking a considerable area and annoying hundreds of people who just wanted to get from A to B without tripping over or having to squeeze past those inconsiderate morons. I still get angry even thinking about it. Repos should know better, they've been at the fair long enough. I actually know one person who liked the game but would not buy it just because he was so annoyed by this.

I enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would. It's plays fairly quickly and is actually a lot of fun

Gameplay is interesting and varied and even the sleeper role is interesting as you must quickly work out who is telling you big fat fibs and who can be trusted, which is a lot more difficult than it sounds.

The card holder bed is really nice and thematic and I like that there is a pillow piece which covers the unused word thus there can be no confusion as to which word you are describing to the blindfolded sleeper.

RATING: 7.8
I love the art - i love the concept. I feel like the pace of the game is a little too quick to for it to blossom. Here's what i mean - the game creates a dynamic where some people are giving junk information, others quality info and others are playing both sides. This is a cool thing for the player to try to discern and they have to make this judgment within seconds - this part is fine. What I think isn't so good is that the entire round plays out so quickly that it's tough to carry that perception with you for any decent amount of time. I felt myself just trying to make the best guess for each particular card as opposed to linking up the clue with my sense of whether that clue giver was to be trusted or not. Maybe this game is like gaining fluency in a language - where in the beginning you experience chaos and a feeling of accelerated time - but as you progress things slow down and coherency emerges from familiarity.

Un jeu assez joli. Un joueur dort, les autres doivent lui faire devnier un mot. Mais certains des autres joueurs sont des gentils, des méchants ou des chaotiques. Ce qui fait qu'il faut faire le tri dans l'information fournie. Très très classique, en gros.

This is my new favorite party game! It does everything I love about games like Codenames and Dixit, but probably implements them even better. I could see more non-gamers who would enjoy this game than other recent party gamers and existing gamers will love that there is more actual game to the memory and strategy to the different player roles. Almost perfect... but one quibble (a tiny one) is that it’s extremely easy to win if you randomly get to be the Boogeyman more than once in a game. I

RATING: 8
Delightful game that combines the best elements of Codenames (clue-giving against the clock), Spyfall (who's good? who's bad? who do you trust?) and old-school let-your-hair-down party games (there's a blindfold, for flip's sake ... like pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey) .

It's possible that the shine may fade with familiarity with the deck, but as others have said you could give it more legs by using a Codenames deck.

While it's a competitive game with a winner at the end, it's such fun to play that winning is almost irrelevant.

1 partida.

Un jugador se pone el antifaz y el resto de jugadores, por orden, van diciendo una palabra para intentar que adivine (si tienen el rol del "hada") o falle (si tienen el rol de "el hombre del saco") la palabra que sale en la carta.

Cuando termina el tiempo, el que tiene el antifaz (simbolizando que estaba soñando), deberá tratar de contar una historia en la que aparezcan todas las palabras (cuentan solo las que ha acertado, pero claro, no sabe cuáles son) que ha ido diciendo (simbolizando que recuerda bien o no el sueño).

Las "hadas" puntuarán por cada acierto, "el hombre del saco" por cada error", etc.

Aunque hacer de "soñador" puede resultar un poco estresante y complicado para algunas personas, a todos nos pareció muy divertido.

Ein Spieler ist Träumer und schließt die Augen. Innerhlab von 2 Minuten werden nacheinander Karten aufgedeckt, die die restlichen Spieler mit 1 Wort reihum beschreiben müssen (max. jeder 2 mal). Der Träumer kann jederzeit reinrufen, wenn er glaubt den aufgedeckten Begriff eraten zu haben. Unter den Tipgebern gibt es aber Imps, die möchten, dass der Träumer falsch rät, Fairys, die gute Träume wünschen und Trickster, die eine Balance haben möchten.
Das Spiel funktioniert erstaunlich gut mit Codenames-Karten (original Spiel ist auf Englisch).
Das Spiel macht mir sehr viel Spaß. Am Ende sollte jeder Träumer nochmals seinen Traum durchlaufen und versuchen soviele Begriffe wie möglich zu verwenden, dann erhält er Extrapunkte. Diese Regel hat mich anfangs abgeschreckt, aber eine reine Aufzähung der Begriffe wäre rein Regeltechnisch auch okay. Es macht aber tatsächlich Spaß eine kleine Traumgeschichte zu erzählen, in der die Begriffe eben vorkommen.
Ein tolles Spiel!

Great blend of hidden role game with some Password thrown in.  Scoring is pretty streamlined though it takes a few rounds to get a feel for how it works with the Sandman.  The bed card holder is pretty, but can get clunky with putting cards at the bottom of the deck.  The storytelling element for the bonus provides for some fun laughs as players stumble with trying to remember the words.  Overall, a fun twist in the word communication genre.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Someone falls asleep (that player gets a mask so he can't see a thing), and the other players give hints (an open card on the table) about what he is dreaming about.

But not everyone is giving good hints. Because before the start of the round all hint-givers are dealt a facedown card which depict their role this round. Fairies try to help the dreamer recalling the right dream, but imps will do the opposite by giving weird and distracting hints. Tricksters will balance the game by making the dreamer guess as much correct dreams as wrong ones.

Being an Imp is pretty hard but also the most enjoyable role. When you work together with the other imps (you will know soon enough who is in the same camp) you can give multiple hints that are wrong but are somehow connected. And that's important because when these false hints are disjointed the dreamer will get to recognise the imps fairly easily and ignore their hints for the remainder of the round.

Only downside for me is the lack of cards in the box. You cycle through the cards very rapidly so you get to know all these words. But you can use other cards like the ones in "Codenames".

What a game! Simple, elegant and a lot of fun and laughter!

Very entertaining word-association-with-secret-helpful/unhelpful-teams game. 
The Repos version is ridiculously overproduced but I like it... the elaborate plastic bed that serves purely as a card holder, the headboard that is used only to hide one of the words on each card, the weird dreamy Dixit-like art that serves no purpose other than aesthetic, the whimsical cloud/star/moon scoring tokens.... this is the sort of party game whose presentation elevates it from a solid 7 to a fabulous 8.

I noticed something on my game shelf the other day.  I organize my games by main mechanic mostly.  So all my worker placement games are together, coop games are together, area control are together, etc.  The interesting part is that I was able to fill an entire "cubby" of my game shelves with hidden role games.  This is interesting because for the most part I am not the biggest fan of that mechanic.  I despise vanilla Werewolf and games like The Resistance or Coup.  I've always said because without some other layer of gameplay hidden role is uninteresting.  It's just people blindly accusing each other.

Anyway, that's a long lead up to me liking this game.  The hidden roles are a feature of the mechanics and not main mechanic.  In this game a player is blindfolded and needs to guess the words that show on cards in the center of the table.  Each other player in turn can give a one-word clue.  But each of these other players has a specific role.  They can be a Fairy who is trying to get the blindfolded player (the dreamer) to get as many correct guesses as possible.  The Boogeyman is trying to get them to guess wrong.  And the Sandman is trying to get them to guess right and wrong answers in even amounts.  This is incredibly interesting, especially as the dreamer.  Trying to decipher who is leading you in the right direction and who is leading in the wrong and who is jumping across that line and when they are being true or false is really interesting.

There's also a really fun little layer where after a dreamer's time has run out they are supposed to tell the story of their dream by telling a story that includes all the correct word guesses they made.  Of course they don't really know which of their words are correct or not.

First play was solidly positive.  I really enjoyed trying to figure out the right word to say to help or hurt the dreamer.  Looking forward to more plays.

The cards are absolutely beautiful and the production on them is glorious. The game itself... seemed pretty lacking.

Meccanismo di gioco originale, i turni scanditi dalla clessidra sono rapidi ma non frenetici. L'esperienza migliora all'aumentare del numero di giocatori.

Fun little game with some small similarities to Dixit style games. Here everyone gets roles and try to suggest words to the sleeper so he can (or can't) guess a keyword from a card. While it didn't sound much fun when I was reading rules it was surprisingly funny when the actual game started. Just be sure to play in 5+ players, 4 is the bare minimum.

If you have Codenames, Apples to Apples, or any other word game plus a deck of standard playing cards (and a blindfold) then you can play this.

Download the games rules. Designate red and black playing cards as the good and bad team and use jokers as the tricksters. Deal those out and you're ready to start playing. Just use something to mark the "right answer" and "wrong answer" piles, such as writing on index cards.

Haven't played yet but it seems pretty neat. I'll definitely not be using the "recite your dream as a story" part. If it's integral to the gameplay, then players can just recite the words themselves.

Update: Played a few rounds with eight players using the above method and it worked great. The game itself is just okay. In one round three of the "wrong answer" players happened to all be in a row, so the first three clues for the dreamer were guiding them in the wrong direction which made it almost impossible for the "right answer" team. Overall it seems harder for the "right answer" team, but I suppose that's why they usually outnumber the other teams. Will have to play more to see how it develops, but right now this game is a rung below the greats in this genre such as Codenames and Werewords.

Really enjoyed this one, its like a mix of Dixit and Werewords/insider but it stands on its own as a unique game. My only concern is replayability because even in one game you through a lot of cards, however im just planning on spacing plays out a bit so that shouldn't be a problem.

Guess the words with unreliable explainers. Totally unnecessary production values, as only important thing is the word on the card.

nice idea, nice implementation, wonderful art and the possibility of playing it with a lot of people makes When I Dream a nice title. You will surely have loads of laughs the first times you play it. The problem is: how long can a game like this last? if you always play it with the same people, after a short while the same words come back and the same hints will come back as well, making it more an exercise in memory than anything else.

Word guessing party game with player secret rolls that want to aid and hinder correct answers from the blindfolded guesser.  The interesting memory twist of each round ends with the blindfolded guesser composing a dream with their chosen words--doh!

This is immediately in contention with Repos' other big party game (Cash n Guns) as a unique party game that doesn't really involve much social deduction. I love the unique nature of this game and its beautiful artwork.

A very good simulation of the space race in the 60's.  Can be quite brutal since a failure can really screw up the launch cycle of other launches.  Race to the moon and hope you don't burn up in re-entry.

Interesting simulation of competing space programs, but too many die rolls make for too much playtime.  With the simple failure table (all that I've played with), I think the penalty for failing a manned mission is too severe, which pushes the game into a grind of predicable and yet unexciting unmanned missions.

"Can't Stop" meets the Space Race... See my session report for this remarkable game. Was made into Buzz Aldrin's Race into Space computer game back in the early 90's. This game is every bit the computer game, if you know the one but not the other. It's a bit slow (my first game took four hours to get half-way through) and frustrating but a fascinating ride. Due to the record-keeping components (paper money, a turn log, and a technology development sheet), play is a bit fiddly but manageable. LOTS of die-rolling and chart-consulting. Not much player interaction, either, but that's not really the point. (All things the computer game made pretty transparent.) After that, just hope your decisions are good and your dice-rolls better. Because of the fiddlyness, time involved, and luck elements (especially in the early game), this game loses a couple points. If either the American or Soviet space programs (and the competition they fostered) interest you, take it up a point or two. If you enjoy games like B-17, Patton's Best, "Crayon Rail" games, or similar solitaire games, add a point. Drop points if chrome, luck, and competitve solitaire aren't really your thing.

'Source of the Nile' in space! Equally enjoyable for me but this is very much an 'experience' game about the thematic appeal - there are decisions to be made but they are often secondarly to the luck of the dice and you need to be able to live with that.

Closer to a simulation than a game.  Nevertheless, having grown up fascinated with the space program, I find Liftoff! to be challenging and engaging.  I especially enjoyed the solitaire game.  Agreed, it's a dicefest, and certainly not everyone's cup of tea.  But this far exceeds any other space game on the market in terms of realism, and faithfully reproduces the tension of the early years of the Cold War.

RATING: 7
Generally fun space game that revolves around the early space programs of the various nations and limits itself to the Earth and the Moon. There's equipment and payload, but no fuel or physics to worry about, so that's nice. The game uses a percentage based research system that allows you to invest in various equipment which determines your relative chances of success for various stages of each mission. You can rush things a bit to try to complete missions before other players, but at the cost of reducing your overall chances of success.

There's definitely some luck involved, both in the random events and the success rolls, and the catastrophic failures tend to happen way too often. This is definitely more game than simulation. Here you either embrace the chaos (and the record keeping) or you move to another game. I was able to embrace it and just have fun. You do have some control over your chances, so you can blame the dice, but then again it may have just been poor planning on your part.

Overall I found this more enjoyable than [i]High Frontier[/i]. While that game has a larger scope, the physics can be both annoying and unforgiving. Plus, for all its realism, the auction system and exclusive technology doesn't really make any sense. The UN can't develop a solar sail because the Chinese did? Huh? Perhaps someone needs to create a game that blends these two approaches.

Anyway, I'd be happy to play again from time to time.

Very good game.....funnily enough it seems to work better as a postal game than as a face to face game....I should know, I ran it by post for 7 years.

LOTS of different ways to a cheive your goal, which is a moon landing. However, you have to get back again, which is probably the ULTIMATE goal. Landing a man on the moon is easy....getting him off it again is a tadge more difficult.

Does anyone know what happened to the propesed expansion/second game in the series?

RATING: 6.75
The game itself is fun to play but what hampers it is a large number of missions with a complex mix of preconditions in order to launch.  As well, mission order has dependencies and variables based on previously completed missions.

It's too bad the game has so many intertwined rules.  It reeks of early Avalon Hill days.  If this is the style of game one plays frequently, one can get over the steep memorization and learning curve.  I'm willing to do this for some games like ASL, but not this one.

The other major flaw is that this is a looonnng game.  Looking at 4 hours minimum (probably longer)  in my opinion.

A real "blast" to play!  Hard choices to make early in game.  A long (and fiddily) game where ultimately everything comes down to a dice roll which means the player willing to take the biggest chance (putting the lives of the astronauts at greater risk) will often win.  But a game that has an interesting theme, is engaging to play and certainly showcases the space program of the 1960's very well.

It's interesting how the space shuttle option was so NOT the way to go- makes you wonder about NASA's later decisions... I certainly have killed off my fair share of astronauts in this game! But it seemed an accurate simulation: historically, the USA was rather lucky in their moon efforts (with the notable exception of Apollo 1) while the Soviets lost a whole capsule of cosmonauts on re-entry, and a few more that we never heard about. A good solitaire simulation, but rather fussy mechanics and primitive graphics.

A nice solid game.  Bonus points for being playable solitaire.  At first blush I didn't think there would be much strategy involved, but you do have to think several steps ahead for all your disparate research programs to come to fruition at the same time (and before everyone else's).  Some rearrangement of rules might have helped, because I found things spread out in different sections of the booklet.

that said, there is a good amount of decision making and paths to success here.  the slow cautious approach, the seat of the pants approach, the middle road.  what kind of systems do you want?  how much training?  do you try to jump ahead of everyone in missions completed by accepting the increased risk?

Found Buzz Aldrin's Race Into Space online once, which is a computer game based on Liftoff! Thanks to the people in the forum, I learnt that the author had a few remaining copies for sale. It's a good time, though it's cumbersome and the rules can be vague and insufficient - I'm intending to streamline it a bit with some house rules, if I can.

[i]Liftoff![/i], sounds good. I take a chance and purchase it sight-unseen through the mail. No internet, no word-of-mouth, no holding/shaking the box in a store, no nothing. [u]The unboxing[/u]: hmm, the board and components are really plain, and worse, the rulebook is baffling, utterly failing to properly explain the game. I guess I'll just set it aside for a while.

Eleven years! This is ridiculous, play the darn thing already. So I dig it out and this time manage to penetrate the rules, at least to some degree, and stumble through most of a solitaire game, sort of. Hey, I spent several hours on it: I'm counting it as a play! Okay, been there, done that. Flash forward another eleven years to July,

Thankfully there's now some helpful stuff on the internet, especially Luca Revello's beautifully organized [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/29307/mission-charts]Mission Charts file[/url], that goes a long way toward clarifying the rules. It's still not easy though: the rulebook actually mentions some crucial rules for the first time in its appendices! Still, I'm fairly certain I'm playing correctly now (unlike in 2002). [i]Liftoff![/i] is a fun and atmospheric game in its own retro way. My heart did race a bit on those long, final missions. Ultimately I landed on the moon in 1968 using the one-man "Cricket" lunar module. Ahh. Projected next play? Flash forward yet another eleven years to

I came to purchase this game the roundabout way, by having first played the PC game based upon the boardgame (Buzz Aldrin's Race into Space, or BARIS for short).  I liked the PC game, and when I found out that it was based on this game, I was even more interested in acquiring a copy and playing.

Alas, I've never had a chance to play this yet.

The only games of its kind! If you like games like this, this is the game for you!

On a more serious note, I wouldn't be surprised if this is a fair simulation of the over odds during the space race. If it is, we're lucky we didn't lose more astronauts, and it could be that the moon landing was faked, because getting to the moon is just too darn hard.

A fun game about the race to the moon.  I first got into this game after playing the "Buzz Aldren's Race into Space" computer game, which is based on Lift Off.

In playing the game, you can really see how taking certain steps to mitigate risks early can lead to big pay offs later, though sometimes it may be necessary to do a some missions not necessarily fully directed at your ultimate goal of reaching the moon, but which will bring prestige and potentially additional funding.

Overall a fun and kind of informative game.

RATING: 6
Barely a 6 but Basic game only.  Once the risks are calculated for each mission then it's little more than Can't Stop in another guise.  If you're the first to take a big risk and don't die, then the others are forced to do the same; if you do die, they can take their time.  Parallel solitaire with Yahtzee dice. There is a lot of tension and a lot of laughter.

RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise, Yes it doesn't have a lot of interaction, but it catches the theme very well.
In the game you have a budget which you must allocate between equipment and launches and R&D.
As a game it is a dice fest - you have to play the odds to get the jump on the Race to the moon. 
A bad die role on reentry is a real killer - to the program as well as the crew.
This was Galaxy Trucker before we went out into the Galaxy.

An interesting game on a very neglected subject. The game has its high points, but it isn't perfect. In addition to a lack of some essential reference tables as extras, the pieces are quite utilitarian and could be a turn off to many players who would miss out on what's a genuinely fun game as a result. I do think that the game is highly reliant upon luck and tempting fate; however, so too was the space race, in general, so that aspect doesn't bother me as much.

I'm thinking about "pimping out" my edition with Artscow to make for a more visually appealing game. Will post photos of the end result if I'm satisfied with what I've come up with.

Played at GenghisCon 2007.  A "homemade" game, most of the components are just card stock - but that is OK if the game is good.  Mixed feelings on this one - at first I was having a fun time but I quickly ran into problems.  First, the mixture of what fits together with what was not well defined and very confusing even after it was explained.  So I ended up building things I did not need and not building things I did need.  And the penalty for failure on a mission is just too harsh and makes it very hard to succeed early on.  I think there is a good idea for a game here, but poorly executed.  It needs to be streamlined and made more friendly.  I did like the flavor of the game, the failure charts were fun, telling a story of how you failed.  I would play again, but not often.

It feels unfair to rate this since I've only played the basic introductory game. That was essentially a series a push your luck mini games where failing punished you in future attempts (either through reduced budget increases or loss of R&D dice in future missions if you decide to skip ahead) and where success lead to future successes (the first attempts at lauching the next missions.

As such, it felt borderline broken and if a single player pulled ahead, it seemed likely they would win.

I'm certain that the full game is much more involved and interesting but, based on this one play, I can't see that I'll ever get it to the table for 4 hours to find out. A real shame.

Challenging to play, though I have not played in years.  Players have a tendency to launch missions (especially those with crews) before filling up the reliability of their hardware to the maximum, with the result of lost crews and failed missions.  Let's be careful out there.

Placement game with multiple ways to score points, with an interesting game mechanic (dice options), a short duration (3 rounds), and good scalability (2-4).

Gameplay consists of rolling a set of dice, allocating these dice to the appropriate actions, which are now available to select for that turn, and then selecting and performing an action in turn order.  An action can be: a)place cubes in the appropriate neighbourhood, which generally results in area majority points at the end of a round, b)select a card, which generally gives a fairly significant potential benefit to the player at some point in the game, c)select gold, which is used for building, moving the supervisor, and buying extra dice, d)select camels, which are used to build, or defend against the supervisor, e)move the supervisor, which results in moving your own and/or other players cube(s) out of neighbourhoods and into the caravan (this can be good or bad depending).

Instead of selecting one of these actions (or in addition to, if not playing the 2-player game, which works very well by the way), a player can build a building, paying generally camels and gold.  This is beneficial because the building gives the player special powers for the rest of the game, and eventually leads to a method of scoring points, provided enough buildings are built.

The caravan provides small initial points, but is good for longer-term accumulation of points, as the more goods that are placed (assuming they are placed in different levels of the caravan), the more points the player scores, and the caravan can potentially score more than just once per round.  Overall, there are the following ways to score in this game: 1)placement in souks (neighbourhoods), 2)caravan, 3)buildings, and 4)special cards.

Although this is a light and relatively short game, it does require some planning and strategy and there is definite player interaction from the action selection and the supervisor.  Also, each game can play quite differently depending on the number of players, and the different strategies employed.

Own the [boardgame=149959]Souks[/boardgame] mini-expansion from the [boardgame=47156]Ystari Box[/boardgame] expansion.

RATING: 5
While the mechanics are great and the components and boards are beautiful (the main reason I bought the game), this wouldn't be nearly as good if it weren't such a tight game. You never can do everything you want to (in fact far less), despite the fact that you're guarenteed 21 turns. I find it a very relaxing while still exciting, and there's nothing like chucking 12 dice!

UPDATE: I had my first 4-player game, and must say the game suffered from the extra player. It still works, but on many turns you'll be taking poor actions or cards. On the other hand, a caravan strategy becomes much more viable (since the pips on the die control the supervisor rather than the number of dice), and the building that let's you move the supervisor is suddenly pretty powerful.

Based on one play, but that was enough for me.  Rolling all those dice each turn is great fun, and there's camels too!  Plus, the game plays in under an hour.

The 3D nature of the board makes me want to feel the stucco of the buildings.

This game has a most interesting dice mechanic and I have fits determining whether the camel strategy is as good as it appears to be -- knowing there is a debate about such things in the BGG community. I refrain from reading too much about it since I wish to discover the game (and its affiliated strengths and weaknesses) on my own terms.

I've enjoyed my time spent with this title, and seek to do so further in the near future.

RATING: 4
One of those game that tricks you into thinking you are making decisions.

Unlikely dice rolls drive the game. If the dice rolls every round were evenly distributed the decisions would be put back in the hands of the players. But then why have dice at all.

Camel strategy really makes this feel kinda broken.

RATING: 7
Another fun economic development game. A supervisor is moved somewhat like Caylus' Provost but the result is a cube that could be sent to the point accumulating caravan. Cards can be very important to development. Actions are driven by dice roll that are allocate to: highest to gold and then lowest #s allocated from lowest to highest. This could leave out one or two market sectors. # of dice can mean: # of gold, # of camels, # of cubes to a souk, or (the next two are always choices) grab a card or move the supervisor. 3 weeks in a game. 7 days (turns) in a week.

RATING: 9
An enjoyable and very fast-moving game. I did terribly and loved it, which is always a nice sign. The dice don't bother me at all. I think people who complain about the randomness they bring are just covering up the fact that they aren't good at making the tactical decisions. This one has enough depth and plays fast enough that I could see myself getting it to the table quite a bit. UPDATE: there are so many cool little combinations that I become aware of each time I play. Very fun. I always end up in last place and I still love it. UPDATE: this game is still going strong. It is a wonderful game into introduce novice gamers with, and the excitability and fast-paced nature make this one easy to play multiple times in a row. This might be my favorite game of 2006! UPDATE: I love this game!

Rated up a notch following further play - really excels as a middle-light, and I write as someone who bought Caylus at Essen on its release with the extra tile, and promptly sold it after a single play: for me it was just too long for what it was. For me, Yspahan (as well as Through the Ages) were the games of Essen 06.

Now that I have the cards from Ystari we gave this a spin (4 player with my kids aged 14, 12 and 9) and it's a great little game, fitting perfectly into the middle-light weighting, with lots of player choices. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Impressions after 2 3 player games:

Feels a lot like Puerto Rico but with less... that is, about 50% less play-time, 50% less learning curve and maybe 20-25% less strategical/tactical depth. 

That's actually a really good deal, so I think this game should appeal strongly to anybody who enjoys euros. 

The only down-side is that the game is largely an incremental one - you don't get the thrill of setting up and excecuting a "big move"... I mean, maybe you got really lucky with the dice, but that just doesn't give the same kind of satisfaction. This is where it loses out to games like Samurai, though, conversely, that game cannot offer the different paths to victory that Ysphahan does. 

Overall, a great game. We'll see how well it holds up over time. 

Edit:

Game going up to a 9 because so many people enjoy it so quickly. Also, I played a game with 4 and it may have been even better than with 3, 2 on the other hand was not so hot.

After a few plays, this game is already moving up for me. Couple of things. First, the depth is just beginning to be made clear to me - so replayability is high. Second, it plays in a time slot that no other game I have does: 45 min. I understand the caravan strategy - and if your opponents don't, you can win rather handily. However, I still enjoy playing this very fine game.

RATING: 8
Great fun.  Sort of a light and fluffy version of something a bit more heavy (Caylus, apparently, but I haven't played that).  It's certainly got some nice decision making in it, but you never feel stressed about that.  Some nice mechanisms and a lovely colourful board.  I must say though, that the "originality" of the dice rolling mechanism seems slightly over-done.  It seems like a cousin of what went on in Tonga Bonga, to me.  I'd be surprised if the designer hadn't taken a peek in that direction whilst making this game.

RATING: 7.5
*Rating based on one play.

This is a straight-forward game with an interesting dice mechanic.  The current player rolls a set of dice, and then players take turns picking from the resulting dice values.  The dice provide resources, money, or cubes that players place on a central board to score points.  There's a fair amount of routes that can be taken to victory.  It was an enjoyable play, but I do wonder how much replayability it has since it does not seem especially deep.

+Interesting dice drafting mechanic
+Mostly intuitive rules
+Plays quick with little down time
+Neat little wooden camel bits

-Limited number of cards and non-variable player boards could limit replayability
-The "Supervisor" pawn rules were a bit unintuitive
-Rather unusual color scheme using pastels

RATING: 7
A fun game although sort of feel it would be better if things weren't scored/eliminated so often. In our 3 player game the board never seemed to fill up much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great quick game with that "so much to do, so little time" feeling throughout. I think the game is pretty well balanced, but obviously any game with a core mechanic of dice rolling is going to have its share of luck (and luck management). I think a core appeal is that people enjoy rolling a handful of dice and the last time I did that was when casting a fireball in D&D.

This game has an interesting combination.  I'm not entirely sure on strategies yet.  I like the different usage of dice - almost as a means of currency with chance rather than pure chance (for example).  Give this one a shot.

Downgraded from 7 to 6 (6/18/08).  Fun and interesting, but not all that many strategies to pursue.  I'll play this from time to time, but I'll rarely be looking to play it.

Ystari game, you cannot go wrong. Theme is Persian fair where you need to earn points for occupying sets of buildings in various parts of the city and also ensure a presence on the camel train. A unique dice system decides the number of items to be placed and where they can be placed and also allows control of the shah's supervisor. Good game.

An approachable game for nongamers with some basic resource management (gold, camels), area majority and building elements.

A very tricky game: always so many decisions to be made (even if you're the last player in a turn). The dice element adds enough of a random factor that there appears to be a high re-playability factor in Yspahan.

2-4(3,4)

At a seven right now. It's fast, pretty light, and uses dice in a way that reduces the luck of the roll. The supervisor is an interactive element in stocking the caravan or kicking out of a souk. Camels and money can get pretty tight and are pretty crucial (money, especially, if you're trying to stock the Vase neighborhood and NEED all six values to roll). There are a lot of things to consider (souks, buildings, the caravan ... as well as trying to stay on top of resources) to keep things lively, but I'm not sure how long this one will remain interesting.

{2 plays, 4 players} It might drop a tad down the line, but I'm really loving it right now.  Just enough decisions to make it fun, but not too many to slow things down.  The "caravan" strategy can be powerful, but so can the "souk  2" strategy.  Neither is a lock... nor a given, since you're somewhat at the mercy of the dice.  And can I just say that the dice allocating system is a brilliant piece of design.  Someone called this the current Web of Power, and that seems fitting.  The mechanics of each game are nothing alike, but the *feel* of each is the same for me: packs a LOT of game into 30-45 minutes, while still being fun and light.

not exactly sure what to think of this one.  i love the production, play speed, teachability, gold dice concept, variable player powers as buildings, etc.  it didn't seem like i could direct toward my strategy as well as i had hoped, though, and i think there will be a number of rote decisions such as building the camel building before the gold building.  i'm not the biggest fan of the pc version because of how difficult i find it to quickly note the actions of my opponents, but hopefully that will fade with experience.  i expect that replaying the game that way will divine my ultimate opinion.  even if it turns out that it isn't the cat's pajamas, there are still enough choices and it's quick.  i've only played it with 4, so it's still plausible that i could love it with 2.

This is an interesting and very quick game that will likely be much lighter than expected.   The dice factor is important, but it is not a bad thing in the game since it only drives what can be done - not what must be done.  Also, everyone is subject to it equally so it can be planned for and managed.  There are a couple of approaches to take and depending on how the game develops, might lead you to a win.  This is good game that is light enough for casual players and families alike.   Great filler / opener / closer for a game night.

(Sometimes camels are plentiful, sometimes they just don't want to come out and play.) 

Has a rather ... unique color scheme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Seems to be an excellent game - I suspect there are multiple routes to victory,  although I managed to get the "don't need camels" card twice in the early game,  and this meant I had a fairly easy time.  Maybe I was just lucky,  but this did seems to skew things a little.

RATING: 6
The time given, viz 45-60 minutes, is grossly underestimated. We only managed to finish this game once, and it took almost three hours (the other couple of times we broke off after 1-2 hours when the end wasn't in sight for another long time).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
There's some depth, tough decisions, some-but-not-too-much randomness (I really like the dice mechanic), and it's fairly quick. It's easy to see why it was one of the runners-up for the Spiel des Jahres. Plus it has camels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the best use for dice I've ever seen. The game has a fair dose of strategy, but you're forced to adapt to the current available actions, making for some neat tactical moves as well.

The multiple paths for victory are done magnificently, and should be clear enough even for new players (instead of making them so contrived and strange that you need to play several times to get them right).

UPDATE: I still like it, but it's a bit long for what it is. Down to a 7.

Great game.  Unique mechanics for game play.  I love the use of the dice for resource selection.  Reasonably simple to learn and a fun way to get new Europlayers into non-english based concept games.  Limited to too few players though.  Needs an expansion to 6.

RATING: 8
A colourful game, easily plays under an hour. Surprisingly lots of decisions (especially if you're choosing first) but not so much for AP to set in. Turns are quick, everyone stays involved and rolling so many dice is great. Building seems to be the route to victory in the few games we've played so far (4 players). Opportunities for some 'mean' strategy too. The ladies in my group particularly loved this game - probably the wooden camels and vague reference to shopping.

RATING: 8.5
Bumping rating up from 8 after a few more 4er games and a 2er game with the official variant. The 4er game seems to mostly revolve around the special buildings and I've yet to see a successful caravan strategy. Despite this, the game remains fun and fresh. I suspect the sweet spot for this game will be with 3 or 2 players as with fewer players, the game options open up and there are definitely many different routes to explore. There are interesting tactical and medium range decisions, and even some degree of interaction between players throughout the game. I like the use of the die to determine available actions. There seems to be a significant amount of depth, especially considering the lightweight feel to the game. The pacing of the game is excellent and the 21 turns go by in a flash. I'd say a good choice for gamers and non-gamers alike. Spiel des Jahres 2007? It would get my vote.

{2P: ???, 3P: 8, 4P: ???}

[i]Yspahan[/i] has been an unplayed game in my collection for over a year now.  When I'm looking to teach a new game to my family, I usually sort on Board Game Rank.  Finally [i]Yspahan[/i] rose to the top, and we got it to the table.  I remember hearing a lot of buzz about the game, and was interested to see what it was like.

To my surprise, there were dice!  I'm always excited to see dice in a "Eurogame," because typically they represent too much chaos for that fare.  The extended result is that when you do find them, their contribution has been implemented in an interesting way.  In [i]Yspahan[/i], the dice control the access to resources or locations.  I enjoyed this mechanic better than the resources in [i][thing=55670]Macao[/thing][/i], but not as much as the risk mitigation [i][thing=34635]Stone Age[/thing][/i].

The ability to invest in special powers may have been interesting in 2006, but it is pretty commonplace in 2011.  This is another byproduct of the "cult of the new:" if you're not playing a game close to its release, then any innovations it may have introduced (and I'm not saying that [i]Yspahan[/i] innovated at all) will have had more time to be copied.

With three players, it's hard to find a reason to mess with your opponents versus optimizing your own play.  My understanding may change as we further explore this game.  I loved the camel meeples, and the artwork is richly saturated and pleasing.  [i]Yspahan[/i] can be a fast playing game, with just enough complexity to be intriguing, but not so much as to cause analysis paralysis.  In other words, it's a satisfying game to play with the family, and that's always a plus.

RATING: 5
The bucket of dice that comes with the game should be sufficient clue that this game has a significant random element. Whilst the dice aren't used in a roll and move or combative sense, the allocation to actions can fall favourably to a player or cut him off at the knees.

An escalating play that makes bash the leader inevitable and weakens the player who wields the axe. Prone to screwage with no real way to defend against such action, this game has the veneer of a structured engine building mechanism, but fails owing to the lottery of the dice and the lack of cohesive control.

Fine for people who don't mind the game playing them, but frustrating as hell for players who dislike chaos.

Here's an example of why I love this game. One time we played, I saw a chance to get a bunch of cubes on the caravan early in the game, so I took it. My wife focused on getting a bunch of buildings made. My mom was working on her souks. All three of us tried very different strategies. In the end, I won, but it was very close.

A good amount of strategy, but also a nice, quick pace. Turns go by very quickly, not much downtime. This is one of our favorites.

I like the quickness of this game. There are also different tactical approaches, but the options are not too deep so as to cause AP. Luck plays a big part, but it is still possible to have a strategy. So far, my only concern is the reliance on camels and how luck can negatively impact this.

Most of my games are 2 player. It works well like this, but I think it's better with 3 or 4.

Four plays (2 x 2-p, 2 x 3-p).

I've enjoyed this very much indeed. I think the 2-p variant is a ton of fun, and the fact that it plays so quickly is a huge plus. I didn't see much use of the caravan in the 3-p games (though I can see where it might come in handy), but it's definitely a force to be reckoned with in the 2-p version...which makes it difficult to play a defensive game...not sure if I like that aspect or not, but it's still got me interested in playing a lot more games to test a few strategies out. Price feels a bit high for what comes in the box - that's my only real complaint at this point.

My first Ystari, played Sylla shortly afterwards, and I have to say that if these two represent Ystari then I like the publisher a lot.

Money (and camels) are tight, there always seem to be too many things you want to do and not enough things you can do, not to mention at least two major strategies for winning. Definitely worth another go.

Update: Played several times now and understand the strength of the caravan (which wasn't immediately apparent). Like it even more. Light but very playable.

Further update: Ben and Yucata.de have convinced me that the 2-player variant is pretty much broken. 3-4 is still good though.

I'd been wanting to play this game for a while, and when I finally did, it didn't disappoint. I played with 3 players, and it was really fun. It's not that long (less than 45 minutes), is fast-paced, and offers some interesting decisions, making it a perfect meaty filler. The game is balanced and offers different ways to score points. Even though the dice obviously add an element of luck, it's how you fit the dice results into your overall strategy that differentiates the good players from the bad. The player interaction is subtle and takes the form of choosing a certain group of dice to block someone or moving the supervisor to break up someone's souk, even though that might still net them some points. I've since played with 4 players, and it works just as well as with 3. The official 2-player variant on the Ystari site works, as well. There are a few minor rules changes, but it felt just the same as playing with more players--an excellent 2-player game.

At last a fresh game mechanism. (I won't say original since there is sure to be a precedent but I can't recall it) Played this several times now and no closer to establishing a viable strategy, have seen several approaches win. Fun, fast and challenging, what more can you want?
Update: After many more plays this seems to have the St. Petersburg problem. One dominant strategy means that everyone has to jump onboard and the game reduces to luck. But getting to that point is such great fun that I still highly recommend it.

Played once. A co-player described this as "Caylus light." That's not a bad off-handed comparison. Players collect points by building buildings with camels and gold (I don't get it either); putting cubes on city quarters to claim control of them; and using a "supervisor" to ship cubes off in a caravan. Actions and available resources that the players may take are governed in some degree by rolling a clutch of dice. This is mitigated by allowing players to perform a range of actions regardless of the throw. The fun is in mini-maxing the process to earn more points than the next guy. More fun can be had by using the supervisor to interfere with the plans of others. Whee.

Have played several 2 and 3 player games.  I now have finally played a 4 player.  Really adds quite a bit more tension on choices.  Really makes the cards more important, especially since the 4th player typically doesn't have much of a choice for dice. Adds a good amount of tension to the game.

A good game with an innovative dice mechanic, but people with an aversion to luck should probably avoid this game.  Sometimes the dice rolls don't balance out, and it can be tough to catch the leader.  There are lots of tactical and strategic choices mixed with luck so I have found this game to be good with gamers as well as family.

RATING: 7.5
It has dice, so yeah, there's luck involved. That's not a problem for a game of this weight and length. The dice get thrown 21 times and that mitigates luck somewhat. Although it can be quite important what the dice do on your turn, since you have first dibs then. Then again, which bonus cards you get can also impact your succes a lot. The right card at the right moment can make all the difference.

Very enjoyable gameplay combination between action choosing and push your luck. It's a nice filler and also pretty good as a gateway game.

Note: In my experience it depends heavily on group thinking whether the camel track gets used at all. In many games it feels like an appendix.

Feels a bit like Caylus - but lighter and with luck of the dice thrown in. Furthermore the 'punish your opponents' mechanic of supervisor is nasty in this one because your only defense is to have camels. They're the key, get camels and you're happy, don't have them and your in trouble. Die roll mechanic gives a lottery feel to it. And lots of opportunity for kingmaking ... Theme is totally tacked on, feels as dry as the dessert :( Overall I don't like it much, rather play Caylus for most of the mechanics, or a shorter filler for if random game play is what is wanted. *** Update, maybe this is less random than I think as I seem to do rather well at it! But when I'm playing I don't feel this is the case and still don't like it much, at least it's quick.

Dice rolling leading to resource/point generation.  Has dice, but doesn't feel random.  It's also not overwhelming, as you only have a set number of actions each turn, the trick is maximizing potential output.  Don't quite get the theme.

Definitely one of my favorites.  Word of warning though, 2-player IS broken.

After playing this game only once, I have to say I really like it.  Using the dice to determine which actions are available during the turn adds the element of the unknown into the game and is just plain fun.  Want to even the odds when its your turn to roll the dice?  Just spend some gold and buy extra dice.  Want to boost your merchant's abilities a little?  Just buy one of the building upgrades.  I found the game full of neat little mechanics like this which make for lots of interesting decisions.  I think Ystari has a winner on its hands with this one.  And I'm glad that it's lighter faire than caylus that plays quickly.  As you can tell I'd very much like to play this again soon.-Will

RATING: 4
Okay, I have played this game about 10 times now. The rules are pretty simple and even my 7 year old can play this game. However, there are many ways to score points and sometimes that is hard to see for a 7 year old. There is some luck involved but not too much. The nice thing is that it is a great family game that can be played in about 45 minutes, the two player rules (on ystari's website) work pretty well. I think my wife summed it up the other day with saying: "I can play this game and it doesn't hurt my brain while I am playing it".

++Update. I have about 20 games in now and I have come to the conclusion that the game is indeed broken. I made it to the semi finals at WBC and everybody pretty much plays the same strategy. The camel track. Get the houses in the middle that are opposite of each other, get the caravansarei and just deliver and get two cards every turn. It really seems there is only one way to win.

1 play w/ 4.  Light, easy to teach, and plays quickly.  A very nice gateway / social game.  Substantial luck - a late game roll with 3 dice in the vase district pretty much decided our game, since it netted the start player 20 points (with the last 2 buildings built).  But it was fun, and will likely see many more plays.

Update: This one has been hard to get back to the table, and I finally traded it away.  It is a little to heavy for non-gamers, and way too light for gamers.  It has lots of decisions to be made, but can be decided by the dice alone.  Perhaps the most frustrating part of it is that the dice won't necessarily decide the game - they will sometimes even out over the course of the game.  But it is just as likely that they will favor one person over the others, or decide the game with a key roll.  So you have to invest yourself into the game with the understanding that good play might win the game, or the dice might decide to have their way with you.

Comprado a mila-spiele.de en medido conjunto en julio del 2010.
Consiste en hacer más puntos que los demás colocando cubos en los zocos de cuatro barrios diferentes, enviando mercancías a la caravana o construyendo edificios.  Me gusta mucho y me parece bastante origian el sistema de configuración de acciones disponibles (fase de suministros) a traves de la colocación de dados.
La partida dura 21 turnos repartidos en tres semanas. Al final de cada semana hay un recuento según los barrios ocupados y se limpia de nuevo el tablero. 
Las partidas dan la impresión de ser bastante rapidas... La unica pega es que es solo para 3 o 4 jugadores.

My least favorite camel game (oasis, through the desert, and timbuktu are all better).  It's like a puzzle that needs figured out, and the more i play, the more i realize that the puzzle isn't worth figuring out.  It's like puerto rico, in the sense that there's very little interaction with the other players.  anyway, it's not all that fun nor interesting, and its awfully expensive, so i really can't recommend it.

Best fun I had rolling the dice in a game since Star Wars: Queen's Gambit, but outdone by Stone Age. The fun is in the competition for placement in districts and movements on the caravan. Quite tactical, but not overwelmingly driven by dice. Once you commit to a strategy, you must attempt to finish your settlement plan. But, there are other paths to victory and the cards can modify your plans for you. Not pleased with the possible kingmaking that can occur with the 3 player game. UPDATE: After about a dozen plays have not been able to make the caravan work for me. There are simply not enough actions in the game to place cubes and select moving the supervisor to add them to the caravan.

A SdJ nominee, I had heard many references to Yspahan. After one play, I must confess I was a bit underwhelmed: there is very little tension when choosing actions. Since the best choice is almost always obvious, you play in automatic mode, so to speak. As far as dice games go, I find Troyes and Alien Frontiers largely superior.

Yspahan fills that sweet spot that we were hoping Amyitis would, but didn't.  There is a lot of depth here, with just the right amount of luck to manage, all in a playing time that is quite reasonable (30-45 min).  By and large, the game is an economic area controller - roll the dice to determine possible (locale and number of) cube placements, trying to hold complete sets of colored buildings in various neighborhoods.  This is certainly the main road to success, but there's also a caravan that serves as a spoiler - you can take goods out of some shops and place them in the caravan for immediate smaller points, which, as you fill the caravan, become much larger points.  Thus, if one person dominates the caravan, it can be a game changer, but if both players are matched and cagey, filling the caravan equally and competing for souks, the game will come down to who managed tactics the best.  The cards and buildings allow more variation to come into play, mixing it up by allowing resource conversions to VPs, adding freebies to the boards, or gaining extra VPs or dice.  All in all, it's great to have a few strategic choices that are fairly clear (thus competitive) with many tactical options.  And the turns are quite short, tense, the game really flows along.

I love dice euros, and I own quite a few now. This is definitely one of my favorites. You always have plenty of options, and the camels/supervisor allow for some interesting decisions: you can try to move the supervisor away from your opponents to score more points in the caravan, or you can force him upon them to make them give up spots on the board. The result is LOTS of indirect player interaction. The game also works well with two players (though I'd like to try a 2-p variant with each player using two colors to limit the board options).

UPDATE: Second play was more promising, so I've bumped my rating up to a 5. The game is still soulless, and the choices aren't that interesting usually, but it at least moves along pretty quickly and every so often it throws you an interesting dilemma. A long way from a buy for me, or even from having much desire to play again, but if you asked me to play an Ystari game this is probably the one I'd take. At least it's short.
---
This is not bad actually, and of all the Ystari games perhaps the most appealing to  me; but that's just not saying too much. Yspahan is clearly trying to be sort of a "downmarket" Goa, minus the auctions, plus a Bailiff, and I think it's partially successful (it's no longer the purgatory of boring analysis that their previous games were). But there is also some weird stuff in there too - the most dismaying for me was the rule where the player order on the last turn is dictated by score at that time. But, getting an early pick in turn order is a big deal, and at that point there are huge numbers of points untallied, so our game saw the player who was *clearly* ahead get the powerful bonus first turn while *clearly* behind players got screwed. It was particularly irritating for me because I found out about this only as it came up. This is just dumb; there had to be a better way.

Yspahan was OK to play once, but really I wasn't very impressed by it. The buildings and action cards are a fairly transparent Goa ripoff (I'm not fundamentally against borrowing ideas, but I prefer if designers at least tweak things a *little* bit). I like dice games generally, but I'm not clear what they really accomplish in this case other than to occasionally make the game feel arbitrary. And ultimately, I strongly suspect that like Caylus this will be a "one way to win" game, and he whose dice line up most efficiently with that way to win will, well, win. There isn't enough player interaction in the game for it to work out any other way, really.

This is all problematic enough, and the real deal-killer then is that Yspahan has no theme. It's just another abstract building/placement game with something pasted on top of it. I don't demand awesome theme in all my games, but if a game has any complexity at all I do tend to expect some reasonable attempt. Yspahan does not deliver this - if it's possible, Yspahan feels even more thematically disjointed than Ystari's other games - so I doubt I'll play again.

Oh, one last thing, at $50 Yspahan is rather overpriced. Even if we assume I'm wrong and this is a nice little medium-weight, I don't think ti could justify the $50 pricetag.

I went into this with pretty high hopes and am pleased to say Yspahan did not disappoint. This is a such a gem. Lots of different options on each turn, and some tense decisions since you only ever get to do so much and you always want to do so much more. The dice add the perfect amount of chance to the game... ensuring that nothing is 100% safe, thus forcing you to incorporate playing the odds into your strategy. Add in a good amount of interaction and multiple (seemingly) equally-valid ways to score and you've got a winner. Best of all, the game moves at a really brisk pace and packs a lot of punch into about 45 minutes. I'm happy to see that the two player variant is splendid, too. NEED to play this one more, as I can see my rating going even higher.

Fun game for game nerds.  There are three distinct strategies for scoring which lends good replayability interest.  Unfortunately, I have found this game to be somewhat inaccessible for non-gamers because there are many minor rules and exceptions that cannot all be remembered and used in the first or second play but, over time, they are all very useful as part of a complete strategy.

A unique dice game with action selection, area control, purchasable special abilities, and single-use advantages all thrown in.  The gameplay flows elegantly.  There may be some balance issues, especially if one player accumulates many camels at once, but I suspect there are ways around this.  Beautiful board and components too.  The rules suffer from ambiguities and imprecise language, but a quick run through the forums will clear these up.  All in all, a nice example of a light-to-medium-weight Euro!

Revising my initial review...great game for 2006, but really doesn't hold up.  Some games from that time period do, but this one shows for what it is.  Dice selection to fulfill one of two main strategies, that ultimately end up in very similar positions.  Because 4 players will play this game, the winner is the one with a clean jersey at the end.  Tired of these tactical messes...Falls into the same category as Age of Steam and El Grande, where it only matters how tortuous the other players make the path...you could play the best game ever, but the other players decide your ultimate fate way too heavily to be interesting any more.

I don't know. Would it kill publishers/designers to create a theme that isn't totally lame? Do people read books about camels? Watch movies/tv shows about them?

Yspahan is kind of a dice filler game played on a map. It's okay for what it is, and even though there are multiple paths to victory, I don't think there is a great replayability.

Comment on my first (and likely only) game: "This one didn't thrill me. It seem VERY scripted. The best move available never seemed that hard to spot. And when luck was against you, there was always taking a card. Too forgiving."

There is actually a game here, even one of minor merit.  This is damning with faint praise which is in part a shame because the game is cute, slightly charming, and inoffensive.  But it is damning with faint praise.

RATING: 7.5
Not forgiving to newcomers, so don't be discouraged if you get destroyed in your first couple of plays. There may be some imbalance issues with the caravan, which prevents me from rating this one a little higher, but they are by no means a game breaker. Fun, quick-playing game that makes inventive use of dice rolling.

UPDATE: After having it played with a friend of mine who has "solved" it, the magic disappeared a bit...Should teach me, that I ought not to have a look at the indepth "Making of..."-analyzis of my dear friend....they are surely brillant but they have a strong tendency to spoil the fun of a game...

RATING: 6
Once you've played this a few times, you'll realise it all comes down to a bit of a luckfest, most dice rolls you could get are worse than just drawing a card, and what cards you get are random.  Therefore you're only really going to get a real swing if you're first or maybe second when the dice is rolled, and here is the other place where the randomness comes in.
The gameplay is quite fun though which does make up for it, but I predict this game will fizzle out after the first year or twos buzz.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A gem of a game. Short but grunty enough to keep me coming back to it. Plays surprisingly well with the 2p official variant from Ystari.

Don't forget the discard a card rule.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like the clever way the dice are used.  Strategy unfolds as the game progresses, as players react to the options the dice give them - no one knows what the next roll will bring.  The games seems to move so quickly - the pressure to get something significant done is huge but all part of the fun.  There is enough to think about and yet overall the game is fairly simple.  Excellent balance...there is no superior strategy.  Plays great with 2,3 or 4.  

I thought that my rating would go up with repeated plays.... but in fact it has gone down (from an 8 to a 7).  The dice play a significant role in the game and they can mess up what you need to do to pull of a win.  There is not much strategical thinking to do when you start counting on a lucky roll to shift the game in your favour.

It is a light hearted dice infused strategy game that is still worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is the most refreshing game I think I have every played.  The use of the dice is a clever twist that allows one more control over the luck factor.  There is also so many paths to score points.  When the dice don't favor me, I can stay in the game with card draws.  Gold elludes me, I can focus on the caravan.  Not getting the neighborhoods I need, just build.  I think I have used a different strategy everytime I won. It's fresh, it's fast, and it's lots of fun.

Quick, clever, and easy to teach dice chucker. The game feels balanced and the various mechanisms fit together rather well. While not an exceptional game by any measure, it is well put and enjoyable. 

+ quick and easy, with turns that move fast
+ interesting mechanisms, well interlinked
+ several strategies to pursue, only rarely you have nothing good to do
+ good components and art
+ the buildings and cards guide well the game strategy for each player

= has some take that aspects that people might find aggressive
= there is quite a bit of luck, although some mitigation possibilities exist
= seems a tad unforgiving if your board development and choices do not aligh

- the 2p game is not that exciting
- half of the time decisions are obvious
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Quite a fun, family-friendly strategy game. Sure, an original mechanism mitigates the luck of the dice rolls somewhat and makes you at least feel in control of the game. (Actually, it's the cards that add quite a lot of randomness to Yspahan, more so than the dice, since the cards are very powerful if you get the right ones at the right time.) Not sure about its replay value. Theme pasted on. And yes, the caravan strategy, if you are the only one to follow it, you'll win 99% of the games. Update: Has fallen to a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game feels so novel that its very fun to play. The different scoring mechanics create a few tensions and interesting decisions in what to do with your actions.

The allocation of the dice is a short decision, but still feels important.

There is a lot of luck, but you can do things to mitigate it a bit. In the end, the game is short enough that if you have horrid luck you won't suffer through it for too long. 

The components are fine. The board is a bit small, but its not a liability.

Good fun,i like the dice mechanic. Perhaps a bit too light on real tactics or strategy for me, but definitely enjoyable and the perfect length for what it is. The caravan strategy seems a little too powerful.

RATING: 5
Ystari is a strange company. I was actively checking out their releases after Caylus, but they have yet to replicate that success for me, mainly because everything else they have released is either stripped down to the point of austerity or features irksome random or hidden elements. 

Yspahan is another lighter game in the vein of Mykerinos and Ys. A short game (about an hour) but there are some tough decisions throughout. There are 4 districts on the small board, and two major currencies: camels and coins. Players roll 9-12 dice at the start of their turn. Dice are then placed on the action track and essentially dictate how many camels/coins/cubes you get. Having a lot of dice in one area is very good (and is obviously out of control for the most part, you can tilt the odds but if you have consistently poor luck (me) then you can still often end up screwed), because you get to place more stuff or receive more currency. There are also two sub-aspects to the game. One is the building board, a track that allows you to improve your actions in 6 different ways, but which requires camel and gold tithes. Buildings also give you victory points. The other aspect is the caravan, which allows you to score points by sacrificing cubes off the board or camels to ship goods with larger quantities of cubes total in that area creating larger scores.

The sum of this game is a tight little affair. The dice can hand out some nice stuff to people at times, but I don't think the randomness is [i]that[/i] much of an issue in a lighter, faster game like this. That said, I also don't have any real desire to play this either. It works, the use of dice isn't all that offensive, but the decisions aren't good enough to make me want to sit down to it either. A pretty textbook 5 for me.

We really like this one.  It's interesting that the system is balanced to the point that nearly any path to victory will put you in the running, but only the smartest use of actions will decide the winner.  It's almost deceptive to think you can try anything and have a shot at winning, as you'll always end up being not too far off the leader.

Very Good game.  First play was solo using 3 players to learn the game.  Second play w/ 4 players was less fun than I had hoped.  Must try with 3.  

Tried this 2-player with each player selecting a second set of dice, after each selected their first set.  Excellent!

I really like this game. After our first game, I liked it a lot, but was surprised that one aspect of the game didn’t seem balanced (caravans), and thus underutilized. Of course on a more careful reading of the rules I realized I screwed something up (thought they were cleared after each week). We liked enough to play immediately again and this time everything fit perfectly. I have to hand it to the Ystari guys; if nothing else, they can balance a game. After liking it so much the second time, we played a 3rd time in the same sitting. There’s a nifty mechanic for action selection. This feels fulfilling, and yet plays easily under an hour (sort of Mykerinos length). So far I think I like it slightly more than Mykerinos, which I also like.

RATING: 8
Players compete in a fictional town somewhere near Yspahan to have their goods transported to Yspahan. They do this by setting up shop in various districts, and then have the overseer pick their goods to be sent off. The game features a novel dice rolling mechanism which works rather well, and overall has a very friendly feeling to it. The game's long term strategies are deceptive, as is illustrated by the fact that many people don't utilise the caravan to score: if used properly, it can be devastating. Nevertheless, the presence of the dice means that some lucky throws can end the game prematurely. I've not seen this happen very often, but the way the selection mechanic works *does* lead to a somewhat constrained feel in the 4P-game. I like the 2P-game better because of the ability to do 2 mostly good actions instead of just 1 average to below-average one. Nevertheless, a fun game, doesn't take too long, and doesn't feel artificially complex either. 

However, where the game really shines is the masterful way in which all the mechanics have been balanced. No single mechanic results in stronger strategies and tactics than another, and for every disadvantage there is an advantage. The overall amount of strategies may be limited, but seeing them come together as effortlessly as they do lends the game a feel-good aura I haven't experienced in quite a while. I've increased my rating because of this.

After Mykerinos my favourite from Ystari; and a proud member of the Dice Done Right Club™.

[b]Update[/b] You know what the one thing is that gets up my nose when playing Yspahan? It's not the caravan strategy: it's difficult to pull off, and easily derailed given any competent set of opponents. No: it's blatant dice luck in largely to completely filling up the Vase district in a single throw (two at most) with a few camels to defend against overseer movement. The amount of points thus obtained is very difficult to defend against. Especially with just 3 players there are too few actions in between dice selections to deal with this event.

May 2007 - Scott Nicholson's video made me want to buy it.  The stand alone computer version has made me love it.  Great, great game.  I like all the decisions that can be made.  Since there is dice, it plays well as a family game too.

Enjoy this one as a two player game the most.  Game goes a tad too fast otherwise.

July 2009 - Bumped this one down to 7.5.  Its getting a bit old now.  Getting camels in the first few turns has a big affect on the ultimate outcome.

This game rocks, I played it once and had to have it.  I think it's one of the most fun games I own and all my friends seem to enjoy it.  The game has lots of strategy options to pick from and none of them are too complex.  Picking the dice to determine the number of actions and the way it limits your options adds a fun and unique perspective.  Unfortuantely I don't think that it scales very well with 2 players. Some of the rules with the Supervisor building can also make the game frustrating.

This game of trading and caravans is almost a little too complex for its own good.  A player's choices are myriad much of the time, but other times you might feel like it's obvious.

I've seen the "goods-to-caravan" strategy play out, and it makes for a really dull game.  I think it would be a stronger game without that element.

But on the whole this is a decent game that I'll play from time to time, even if it won't go on my wish list.

Components: Nice pastel artwork, and cool wooden components. The souks have some nice details. Good iconography for the actions and buildings.

Experience: Very cool game of balancing options. I like the dice element, keeping the selections different each time, and the ability to spend gold to increase the number of dice rolled. And there are almost always several interesting things to do on one's turn. Plays very quickly. I think I prefer it with two players, because of the resulting additional turns (though then the caravan is seldom used). Delicious.

RATING: 6
This was pretty interesting: a nice, simple, and quick dice game with a couple of interesting choices to do with the dice.  The central board, and the roving supervisor, look to provide some element of interaction and a choice between filling shops or filling caravans (while at the same time preventing opponents from filling souks by shipping their goods).  However, camels seem to stop even this minimal level of interaction as they can protect goods in your shops.

The end result is something akin to a roll-and-write game, with little interaction between players outside of choosing dice piles.  It's also in danger of having obvious choices: if you roll 3+ dice in one section, it is hard not to pick them.  

There just doesn't seem to be the space available to carve out a unique strategic position.  That would be fine, if there was more interaction on the board to make up for it (compare with Concordia, Quadropolis, or Ginkgopolis, which have LOTS of interaction on the board to make up for somewhat limited strategic options).

I just don't see playing this over Dice Stars or Castles of Burgundy, let alone Grand Austria Hotel (which I haven't even played yet).

Maybe this is just groupthink, but regardless of what we ended up doing, the game does feel like the kind of game that can easily be "solved" (in the sense of Puerto Rico, where there are optimal strategies to adopt).  I'd be happy to play it again, but it can't survive against the competition.

2nd Edit: Just installed the PC version and have been playing that almost non-stop. After several games agains the AI I have decided that the caravan strategy isn't broken, just something to be aware of. Once you know it, it's possible to keep it from being crippling.

I hesitate to call this a filler, but it's a fast meaty game.  For all the dice you roll I feel the luck is very manageable and with multiple routes to victory you'll see different strategies each game.  The board is also relatively tight (especially depending on how the dice roll) so you'll see some tough competition for space.  For the length you'll be hard-pressed to find a game that is as satisfying.

A shared group of dice are used to randomize what options are available each round. Players take turns cherry picking their favorite dice groups for the round.

Occupy majority sections of the merchant districts, build many of the bonus buildings, or "ship" via the camel caravan. Several different approaches to try.

Yspahan is a dice-ruled system management game. It is clearly dependent on the dice rolls, yet the smart use of the dice makes for interesting decision and "strategies".
The "caravan" approach is slightly overpowered, so it must be actively countered/pursued by every player. 

Overall quality is pretty good and the game plays in less than 1 hour.

Interesting game with lots of dice. Didn't feel like you had that many options of what to do when playing a four player game. Probably better with 3 players.

Update: The caravan strategy seem way too strong. Probably need the rules tweak that you can't sacrifice camels if you moved the overseer yourself.

I love the dice as actions mechanic.  But it's a little too clear what the best thing to take every time is.  Roma does it more interestingly by letting the die roll be your own, and then the order of acting mixes things up.  Oh, and the caravan mechanic is just lame.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First play has me liking this game.  Sure the dice can screw over your best laid plans.  But it is still a fun game of trying to managing your strategy and adapting it based on what the dice provide.  The only negative is that camels seem to be in short supply.  For most of the game, we were taking camels first whenever the dice distribution was somewhat even.  But that may be more due to the building strategies that all of us implemented.  Need to play this one again.  I'm thinking about buying it.

Players set up markets in Yspahan.  Players start a round of play be rolling dice and assigning them in order to game actions.  Actions are to take coins/camels, set up markets on the board in the city, move the "supervisor", or the "bad luck, nothing to do" take a card action.  Points are scored for caravaning (an offensive and defensive tactic), building, as well as cornering the market via property in the city.  Very nice game that is easy to learn, and a great example of how a bunch of dice can work in a game.  Fits right into that 1 hour sweet spot, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I appreciate the fact that, like in Hacienda, there's no majority-winner mechanism in the whole game: either you complete a souk in time to score it, or you don't.  There isn't anything that can be taken away from you; it's even pretty difficult for others to block you.  This means for the most part you're just playing your own game, but I like that.  What I find a little disappointing is that the scoring is very incremental, and your choices, especially near the endgame, often come down to just doing some calculations to figure out which one is worth 2 or 3 more points than the others.  It also seems like the first player in each day chooses camels about 80% of the time, which seems unbalanced, but maybe that's just groupthink.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The dice are somewhat refreshing addition to an otherwise bone-dry analytical game. pick 21 actions as limited by random dice rolls. Try to develop an ad-hoc strategy via coping with the dice. These recent analysis and possibility-crunching releases are not what I consider games though, just logic exercises for multiple players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The game is fun and feels good to play. A lot of little actions going on, but the decisions don't take too long. It does not overstay its welcome. I feel that once you decide on a strategy you'd better (for the most part) stick with it if you're going to have any chance. That said, I felt that my choices were made for me to some degree, or for a more casual experience, that there is often only one clearly 'better' choice on each turn.

I continue to be amazed about two very important elements in this game: 1. how fast it plays, and 2. how little the dice annoy me. Both of these elements can be deal breakers for me (and have been in other games), but with this game they work together to create a very enjoyable experience. If the game was longer or if the dice weren't mitigated, the game would be unpleasant. Fortunately, the game plays crazy fast and there's always a competitive, positve move to be made with the dice.

Good solid game, but ultimately it seems a bit limited.  There's not enough time for different strategies to develop, and upon closer examination there aren't really all that many different strategies to pursue anyway.  By the final round of the game, you sort of feel like you're on a railroad track to the end.  But it gets points for still being fun in spite of these issues - after all, rolling a big mound of dice is a very satisfying experience.

I like this game for the same reason that I like Kingsburg, clever use of dice.  Normally I abhor the use of dice from playing games like Risk when I was younger but I like how it's implemented in this game.  Yes, lucky die roles will have an impact on how well you do but strategy will beat out lucky die rolls.  Though, it seems like a combination of right cards at right time + good dice rolling can sometimes determine a winner.  After more plays Of this and other dice rolling Euros, there are a lot of better options than this game.

I've only played once, so keep that in mind, but It felt like the strategies for victory were somewhat limited.  The cards felt slightly imbalanced.  I think the length may also be a little long for the amount of luck involved, but maybe that was just due to the extra rules and learning time added to the first play through.  I really don't care for the board artwork that much.  That said, it was a pleasant experience and I would definitely play it again and give it a fair shake.  It's conceivable that my rating could go up (or further down).

Like Mykerinos, Yspahan packs a lot of punch for a game that takes about an hour to play.  What really makes the game shine is the clever use of the dice.  Even when you're stuck with some bad choices, you can always opt to take a power card instead, which is usually very beneficial.  The caravan strategy is powerful as well as scoring multiple souks if you get the 2-plus scoring bonus power.

Only two plays of this one, and it's just OK. As far as dice strategy games, I prefer Troyes and then Castles of Burgundy. This one doesn't hook me the way Ystari games usually do because there just aren't enough interesting things to do with your dice. Your roll will dictate your action choice 99% of the time.

There is a bit of strategy in how you hit the neighborhoods vs the camel track. I thought the camel track was overpowered, as one player had the ability to get bonus cards every time he placed on the camel track. At one point, he played like 5 cards in a row to do a lot of stuff. Seemed like the obvious track to follow each game and that the other paths to victory and buildings are simply relatively underpowered. Yeah, gotta do the camel track. And then another player won with a basic neighborhood strategy whereby she spent her turns placing cubes in the souks and racking up points while hitting the camel track just a bit. 

So, at least the routes are balanced. Just wish the decisions were more interesting.

Simple rules. I was able to explain this to my girlfriend and play our first game in less than an hour.
Good quality bits although the cards are a bit small for my taste.

I considered raising this from 8 to 9 but decided against it. However let me emphasize that this is a very solid 8, just not a game that "I want to play all the time"
Also, "simple rules" is probably not true. After explaining the game to more people, I find there are several minor (yet important) options on a player turn which can be hard to remember. Funny thing is, I think these small options are part of what give the game its charm; I feel very efficient (satisfying feeling for me) when I discard an unneeded card for an additional vase for example.

While Caylus and Ys packed a lot of fun and challenge, we found Yspahan to be lacklustre and uninspiring.  The action/dice mechanic is definitely a new design element which works really well.  The problem here is with the lack of tension in the choices to make.  We ran out of all our cubes, camels, gold and cards.  Since the rules do not state that the stocks are infinite, we simply hoarded our ressources and drove up the scoreboard to a silly amount.  The buildings are easy to build and once all are built, the remaining actions are spent moving the supervisor around to fill up the caravan as many times as possible.  There is always the possibility that we didn't do something right.  But we looked at the FAQ, clarifications and session reports, and apparently other players had the same issue.  I'll keep looking but I'm not sure that even if we sort it out, that the game underneath grabs me all that much.  Other games of ressource management, area-control abound by the bucket.  I'ld rather play one that doesn't make me feel like I'm missing something.

In a sense it is Yahtzee on steroids - this was my first (and it was one of the first) dice based Euro's - and now the concept has really grown on me with some great games.  Initially I was a little underwhelmed but I like it more and more now - theme very much incidental but it works.

A lot of dice rolling, but a reasonable amount of luck. That's how I would sum up this game in one sentence. Naturally, you could get a lucky roll and score an insane amount of points, but this is usually rare. There are a number of strategic avenues and it's difficult to figure out the best path to victory so there is some replay value in there. It's always fun to roll a truckload of dice and this game makes you do that quite a bit. A keeper.

Egy könnyed, évlezetes játék. Egyedi mechanizmusok sora, és mégis nagyon ki van egyensúlyozva. Az "áru leszedés -> karaván" mechanizmus pedig mind tematikailag, mind egyensúlyügyileg zseniális.

RATING: 5
Neat mechanics and smooth, quick gameplay.  That's the good part.  Unfortunately, this game has the worst run-away leader problem I've ever seen in a game.  Some people respond, "But all the games I've been in have been close."  Great -- lucky you.  If, however, someone does manage to grab a substantial lead early, say through some fortuitous die rolls, there is no mechanism for catching them.  I don't particularly like games that have automatic 'screw-the-leader' mechanisms built-in, but they need to at least have a mechanism so THE OTHER PLAYERS CAN TRY TO DISRUPT THE LEADER.  In this game, you just have to sit back and watch... and fight over 2nd place.

RATING: 6
Yspahan is a dice game with lots of different ways to score. The use of dice as an action selection mechanism is pretty neat, and in most cases there's something worthwhile to do for everyone. With bad rolls, however, like in most dice games, your options quickly start to disintegrate. Now, even taking a card (which you can always do) is not such a bad move but if it happens too often it induces the feeling of being played rather than doing anything meaningful yourself. The probability of being hit by bad rolls increases with the number of players, though, so less is probably better in this case.

Yspahan is a light dice game that has an interesting mash-up of familiar game mechanics. It's one of those games where dice decide what you can do and you have to make the best of it, and I like those sorts of games. I can see many people enjoying this. And throwing a handful of dice is always fun! I'm surprised how much of a benefit the cards can give you - but that's the point of the game: you can't let anyone capitalize on anything or they will dominate. Everyone has to do their best to react properly and capitalize when they can. I think this game is deeper than it appears to be on the surface.

Awesome trading/economic game with a unique blend of short-term tactics (own enough shops) and long-term strategy (send your goods to camel, build buildings). The pretty board is also a plus. One of my most favorite games that I don't think will ever get old.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
My first few plays of this game were wonderful experiences.  Yspahan offered a lot of fun decisions, with some original mechanics meshed with familiar ones to make an interesting light-medium weight abstract/area-majorities game.  My initial rating of 8 reflected this.  However, after my subsequent plays I find yspahan doesn't scale well and is really only a game for three players, as the limitation in availability of options  with four can become a little too tight, and with two it's just blah.  With four the game changes significantly and there are less viable strategies, and it basically becomes who can place into souks first (i.e.- who gets the more beneficial rolls).  This I find can create a runaway leader problem, as the checks and balances afforded by  the quality of choices in a three player game  becomes significantly reduced in a four player game. i still like this game, but the drastic drop in it's appeal with any number other than the three hurts it's score.

UPDATE:  I find Yspahan to have very limited lasting power.  The game is ok, and can offer the occasional fun but it really never begs to jump off the shelf.

After a few additional plays on the PC it's grown on me.  I'm even starting to see the logic behind a caravan strategy, but it still seems like too much work to pull off, and too much risk.

Update:  Tried the caravan strategy in a 3P game against people who didn't know how it was implemented.  I think I won by 10 points or so.

RATING: 7
Fast game that makes decision-making tough.  Caravan strategy might work always, although I'm more of a proponent of going for all six special buildings quickly.

The Windows version of Yspahan has clearly shown me that the caravan strategy does not always work.  This game gets better the more I play it!

With 4 players, it gets too chaotic and luck-driven, but with 3, the balance is just right.

  I like this because there are fairly interesting viable choices to be made on each turn.  Plays quickly, tactilely fun, blends luck/probability & strategy well, and includes multiple scoring tactics.
  My only downside is explaining all the details of the game to new players.  I am not gifted with elegant and succinct game rules instruction.  In some ways it would be easier to have them kibitz and clarify as you go rather than teach it.  In others words, it can take me longer to teach it than play it, which can prejudice certain kinds of players before they sit for a game (ahem.. kids.)

I have got to say that this probably my all time favorite game. There are so many different strategies to be used that can change in each game. The components are very well made and look beautiful. This game reminds me of yahtzee on crack and steroids at the same time. Probably due only to the dice and the way that you lay them out on the tower. 

The game plays fairly quick and I am always wanting to play another and another. I have played this game many times solo on the computer and I haven't yet become tired of this terrific game. The mechanics in this game and the way they all flow together just make for an amazingly fun experience. I highly recommend this game to everyone to at least try before you buy. This is truely an amazing game.

Don't manage to really like this one after several plays. The theme is OK. The board and parts are OK. The mechanics - the dice tower / the caravan / the buildings - are OK. Overall, the game is clever and well balanced. But something's missing (or am I missing something ?). Maybe the game is a bit too quick for me, and I always end up getting frustrated. A good game though, but a bit too light.

RATING: 2
The theme is presented very ugly. And there is too much luck involved with this dice rolling.
Seriously, if you don't get camels in the first 'week' your fucked up. Because then you can't build buildings and profit for the rest of the game. For me that game is broken.

It's so simple and original that I couldn't resist to rate it at '8'. Of course there is randomness. Of course the game is not complicated. And of course there are many better games (even by Ystari).

But playing Yspahan is just plain fun. And you can use it to convince some non-gamers to eurogames because in case of defeat one can always blame dice.

I enjoy dice games ok, but this one stands out.  Really an interesting use of dice for establishing what your options are in a round, and there are multiple ways to set yourself up for scoring from one round to the next.  That board and components look nice, but they aren't the most functional.  The color variation between areas can be a little difficult to distinguish with some lighting, and it is hard to read how many points each group of houses are worth.  Nothing too bad, but it is worth noting.  Overall, I was impressed with this and I expect it to get a lot of play.

This game is just filler.  The combined effect of cards and dice make luck a huge factor in this game.  I have played it nearly 50 times and each game makes me like it a little less and notice the luck (especially early luck  in getting lots of camels or camel related cards (e.g.  3 camels, or no camels needed for building).  

As a filler game it's not bad but just don't play it too  many times or it will wear out its welcome.

A fairly light and short game with an action selection menu based around a pretty clever dice mechanic. Several different paths to victory (caravan, buildings, filling up districts). Luck in the form of die rolls and card draws plays a role in determining the winner but experienced players will probably win over beginners most of the time. I'm usually no fan of randomness, but the game is short enough and the randomness is somewhat manageable enough to make it acceptable.

RATING: 7
I like it! It's light, it looks nice, and it's fun. I would say it's a light management game with many ways to score points. There are a few strategies you can concentrate on and it's nice to see how your strategy works. However most choices are rather tactical. The luck factor plays its part in the game (you roll a lot of dice, organize them and they give you diferent choices) but it's OK, because the game doesn't take long to play. My only remark is the game is too expensive in Poland and I don't know why.

This is a clever Ystari game about buying areas of a small dessert town. There is a cool mechanic for allocating dice rolls into different areas and choosing the area that works best for you. 

There is also a caravan bonus multiplier mechanic that I have never really spent much time exploring. I think I will try to get more points that way next time and see how it works. This one is fun and is not too hard to learn and flows pretty well. Most people I've play this with for the first time tell me they enjoyed it.

There's a lot to consider in this game, and has many different ways of doing well.  It's unlike anything else that comes to mind, with a lot of interesting mechanics, which is always refreshing.  Despite rolling up to 12 dice each round, there's actually not an overwhelming amount of randomness.

A very neat little dice game. Yes, any game with dice has an element of luck, but this one allows strategy in the way you select what has been rolled. The game plays very quickly, so much so that the game seems to end just when your strategy starts to come together. Definitely invites additional plays, as everything starts to gel just when it ends.

I enjoyed my first game of this and would like to try it again sometime. I always feel like the dice aren't kind to me but that's probably not true. It's a quick and fairly simple game to play but does offer some good strategic and tactical decisions.

After a couple more plays I really like this game. I still feel the luck of the dice could play a part but the game plays so quickly and is enjoyable no matter what the outcome so it seems like a winner to me.

Edit: Really enjoying this game at the moment even though I seem to never quite be able to win. Those damnable dice. Given that I still really enjoy it even though I feel like luck can screw me at times I'm upping my rating to a 10.

Edit: Not playing this as much now.

Camel Meeples!  I like the way that this uses dice in an unconventional way.  When the game starts, I always see if I can pull off the double-caravan move at the beginning of the third week.  It's nearly unstoppable if you're the starting player in the third week, and you have a card that lets you add one cube anywhere on the board.

I find Yspahan refreshingly different.  There are a variety of mechanisms present, but they blend together nicely. The sight of the abundance of dice may be off-putting to some, but in reality the luck aspect here isn’t dominant.  Players have numerous choices to make each turn, and there are a variety of strategic paths to pursue.  There doesn’t appear to be one dominant strategy, and there is enough to investigate to keep me coming back for more.

What a great little game. Not sure if the fun factor would last over multiple plays, seems like it could get a bit stale soon. But for the first go around, I have to sayt I had a lot of fun. I'd say anything wiht camels seems to be fun (tho that's not entirely true since I can't seem to be able to get into Amythis). In any case, there is some potential for this game to be more cutthroat if people use the inspector or whatever it's called a lot. So that aspect might help keep the game fresh and hold up the interest level.

An easy bean-counting game with a nice dice mechanic.  Very interactive but the theme was nonexistent and the strategies seemed dictated by your place in the turn order.  I'd play it again but this isn't a buy.  The theme doesn't exist.  Still, a pretty fun game.  After two plays, the game seems to have a lot of side mechanics that just don't get used.  The caravan sits there doing nothing, no one takes cards, and the provost (whatever the pawn is called) gets moved like twice all game.  I still feel like there was a lot more game to it than we saw, but if there isn't any incentive in the game to do other things, then why would you?  Although two of us had only played a few times, one of our group was a seasoned veteran of the online game.  For a game that looks like it has multiple paths to victory, it really only has one- maximize your points each turn.  I just don't think this is deep enough for me to buy it.

One of the earliest games of this type, Yspahan's influence can be seen in later games like Kingsburg and Alien Frontiers. The dice are used to indicate which actions are available each round and how strong those actions will be. Because of this inherent randomness, strategy is difficult to execute, but tactical play is strongly rewarded. You need to be very adaptable.

After the dice are rolled, players will each pick an action to execute, with the starting player changing after everyone has gone. There is opportunity to stop other players, sometimes in very nasty ways, yet the player being picked on the most has a large advantage as their pieces get bumped to the caravan. It could even make sense to bump yourself there. Turns are very quick, as is the game as a whole, but what you do on your brief turn is often a difficult decision. And many of the choices you make can be further augmented by paying coins, complicating the decision.

While I prefer Alien Frontiers to this game, I'd be happy to play this one as well. It has very low rules overhead, yet presents players with a lot of choices each turn. Certainly a game worthy of the various accolades it has received.

RATING: 4
Played it very few times, and am not fond of it because the luck element is hard to overcome with strategy.  Dice rolls are key -- if you need camels, and it's your turn to roll the dice, and you only get one lowest die, then you'll get only one camel (or two, if you have the right building), or choose to take one of the better groups of dice.  More than that, if you get the right cards (e.g. "get 3 camels", or "place a building with gold only", or "place a good on the caravan for free", or "place a shop anywhere on the board for free"), then you have a significant advantage that is hard to overcome.  I think getting the caravanserai and shipping goods for extra cards is a critically important strategy, but it can be overcome by bad luck for sure -- you need camels to make it work.

Overall, I'd rather play Goa, which has luck (need good expedition card draws), but is much richer and has several winning strategies.

The core of Yspahan is simple to explain; a bunch of dice are rolled, then they are grouped by value and placed in the levels of a tower; the number of dice in the levels dictates how powerful the associated action will be.
There are 5 types of actions: taking gold, camels and placing cubes in sectors of Yspahan are all linked with a particular level of the tower, while moving the overseer and taking a card are things you can do whatever the level of the tower you select.
Placing cubes in the city will grant you victory points for completed sub-sectors (called souks), and sending goods with the overseer to the caravan will also grant points.
You can also have special powers with cards you draw and with some building you can build.

At the start of the week, a lucky roll for the first player has a quite huge impact, so I feel the luck factor is quite high; the dice you are left with on your turn dictate what you do mre or less effectively; of course you can decide to build stuff or to move the overseer, but the impact of these tactical choices is pretty close to nothing in comparison to the effetcs of a good dice roll.
I loved the game the first session we played it because I thought there were a lot of possibilities, so maybe I set my expectations too high; now, I am not that eager to play it. There are good ideas in Yspahan, but I feel that the dice system, while interesting, is at odds with the rest. It is a missed opportunity for a good game.

Component-wise, the game is very attractive; I liked the bright color scheme used, and the cameeples.
The rulebook could be more clear. Repetition of a few words here and there would have increased the rules clarity, and I even found a grammar error (I loathe that, especially when a spell checker would have found it); of course I am referring to the french rules, so this might not be true for your copy.

In conclusion, I think that Yspahan is original, but the luck factor was too high for me; it would have been better without the cards and the buildings, leaving no doubt about it's core nature: a light dice game.
Usually I find the production values of Ystari games to be near perfect, but this time there is clearly room for improving the rules.

I am a huge fan of this game! The only reason why I cant give it a full 10 star rating is because the box art is not very appealing and the artwork may be too "muddy" for some players.

I really have bad luck rolling dice. I mean my dice karma must really be getting spent elsewhere. A friend says I have incredible luck in flipping cards in Zirkus Flohcati, is that where the karma drain is? Well imagine a game in which the central action is rolling dice and I really love it. The way the dice are implemented makes my lame rolling skills work in my favor. That and the fact that you roll so many dice. This game is very simple to explain and very quick to play but really has some nice strategy choices. I haven't played enough to try the caravan strategy and I haven't seen it overwhelm a game where it was tried by others, so you may have a better chance at a win using it, but if the others are aware it might not hurt the game. This and Mykerinos are my favorite Ystari games I've played so far (Hear that Caylus? Yeah, I'm talking to you!;) )

The dice provide an element of uncertainty to each turn, but it is the kind of uncertainty that you can react to and even exert some control over (by buying extra dice - although it rarely seems worth the purchase). Many ways to score, and a combination of strategies seems possible. My early reaction is extremely favorable - another winner from Ystari. Although I prefer it with 3 or 4 players, the 2-player variant is also enjoyable, meaning it will get more playtime in our household. I've been playing the computer version of this (thanks Westpark Gamers!) more than I care to admit.

This was a disappointing design. It's like Yahtzee with a pasted on theme. Boring. Not enough challenging choices. I'm sure there's something to the game, but I just don't care. Not sure I was immersed enough in the theme to care. It reminded me of Roll Through the Ages, which is equally boring. Roll some dice, and make your selection--pick up camels, place some goods in some part of town, or pick up gold. In lieu of that, pick up a card, which gives you some advantages. The way the dice distribute the possible actions, and quantity available is novel, but that's about it. If I want to play Yahtzee, I'll play Yahtzee. Since I didn't care for Caylus, which is another Ystari design, I think I'll avoid their games in the future. Whatever. $49.95 retail?!? Too expensive for this light of a box. Even at $30 from Boards & Bits, this is too expensive for the bits, although there are plenty of wooden cubes and camels, but there's not much heft--there's something left to be desired.

Update (10/01/11): This found a loving home with someone who appreciates the design. I will probably never play it again, but you never know. Down to a '4'.

One of my favorites.  On your turn, you roll dice, which you then group according to number, and then use to determine how many of a given action you can take.  It throws in two major scoring methods (souks and caravan) in addition to two minor methods (buildings and cards) to keep games from becoming stale, and presents the player with a surprising amount of control despite the dice rolling mechanic.  

Is it just me or does the artwork for all Ystari games slowly grow on you, until you come to view it as beautiful, despite an initial impression that sort of left you flat?

I have to say I was disappointed by this one. The die rolling mechanism sounds neat, but most people simply take the action that has the most dice allocated to it, and on your turn you certainly DON'T want an even spread of dice to come up. All this makes the game more luck-driven than I'd like. The weakest Ystari game to date.

I like it.  Light, but after a few plays I think it is deeper than it initially seems. There is often some tension in deciding whether to seize opportunities or to go for something you know you'll need, plus the potential for screwage means there are at least two different winning strategies. Turns out camels are really important.  (4 plays)

Un eurogame ligero de gestión de recursos y control de áreas de duración corta (60 min.) que me recuerda de lejos a Goa en sus cartas y en algunos edificios. Muy destacable la forma en la que se usan los dados que determinan la adquisición de recursos y las maneras de conseguir puntos : las dos principales (los zocos y la caravana) y las dos secundarias (las cartas y los edificios), además del movimiento del supervisor, que añade interacción al juego. Hay azar en los dados, pero no tanto cómo pudiera pensarse... sólo la justa para que el juego no sea soso/seco. Buena elección para ocasionales y quizá, para novatos. Puntos fuertes: fácil de aprender y corta duración. Contras: los afortunados sacaseises ganarán siempre. Tiene pinta de quemarse enseguida. La estrategia de la caravana me parece, a priori, descompensada. (1 partida online)

First played August 21st, 2007.  This takes a bit to learn (~10min), however is a very quick play after the first play.  It took 3 of us about 45 minutes and the later rounds were wizing by, so no doubt it could be played in 30 min.  It seems to have a good balance of luck and strategy.  The dice rolling seemed to be a bit clunky, however we started helping each other out loading the dice on the board after a while and that seemed to go better.  Not sure how to make it better other than perhaps a compartment to roll the dice in so they don't go everywhere?  There seemed to be a few paths to take for victory as well.  Like most games, it will take a few rounds to get use to the mechanics and figure out a strategy to settle on.  Since plays fast and has many facets to the game, I would highly recommend giving this a gameplay and consideration in playing in your rotation of games on a regular basis.

Yspahan is billed as a "dice game," but really the dice just dictate how powerful the actions to be chosen are.  The real game is in planning how to build your scoring engine.  Do you go for the caravan and hope for majority or purchase lots of buildings to dominate the city?  I like the split path to victory and the change in feel depending on the number of players as some strategies can become more or less valid.  It's a good, quick middle-weight game.

Played twice with 4 players. Yspahan has an OK theme, though the artwork and components are of below average quality. The key attraction of the game is the way that dice are used - this is, indeed, an inspired piece of design. The rest of the game is a collection of largely familiar mechanisms competently put together, though I wonder about the usefulness of the supervisor (this was barely used both times I have played).

ehhh...only so so after one play.  The caravan is yet another useless mechanic from a game from these guys in the spirit of the Arch in Caylus and the pyramid builder in Mykerinos.  Really, do they run out of ideas and just toss stuff in to fill out the design?The camels are EVERYTHING in this game, and if you don't roll camels, you won't win since it is very unusual to see camels come around the table to you from the experience I got.  Really not very fun.

Second play seals the deal.  Dumb game of luck.  If you and the person to your right roll well....you win.  If that doesn't happen to you....you lose.  End of story.

The dice feel like they should be adding randomness to the game, but it is just limiting the number of times certain areas can be scored.  Often with the dice, the first two players will get the only good options and the 3+ players are just hoping for something they can use.

It is quite OK, interesting, nice mechanics etc, but there is a big flaw: too much of randomness, which very directly contributes to the final score.

RATING: 7
initial rating 1 game 4 players

4 for 4 for Ystari, thats a lot of 4's and a lot of YS's too. 

Another really good game similiar to Mykerinos, not so much in actual mechanics but in the following ways:

 - Fast paced gameplay
 - plays in 30 - 45 minutes
 - Multiple paths to victory
 - 3 to 4 players but best with 4
 - Nice tough choices but no AP
 - Variable player powers
 - Slight screwage effect
 - About a mid-weight game

This had a really nice element of risk taking in that building late in the week could end up being a wasted action but it is still tempting for the points. Also, WHERE you choose to build is important as you could get jousted by the Supervisor (kinda like the Provost) and sent to the camel track, nice that this is not altogether bad though and sometimes you may even do it yourself to score points up there, especially if you have an incomplete neighborhood.

Lots of ways to score and lots of good choices throughout so luck really doesn't play much of a role like you might think. The dice really just determine which actions are up for grabs and I found it balanced out quite well with only slight variations. The one neighborhood did seem somewhat elusive as it needed the full spectrum from 1 - 6 thrown but then I think that was one of the main purposes for the "gold" dice that could be bought for 1 gold each; to add to the amount of dice thrown and therein increasing the odds for this and also for getting a nice 3 or 4 of a kind. Turn order was much more important actually and this changed every 'day/turn' so that was good too. Also, don't underestimate the Caravan track, some good points can be milked from there and building up 'your' board is quite important as well for the special bonuses, powers and points.

My only knock is it might be a little hard to stop the leader as breaking up his neighborhood will score him points in the Caravan and if he has camels his neighborhood stays intact on top of that. More plays will tell for sure and I'm looking forward to playing again as I am any game with some meat coming in under 45 mins.

[u]TIDBIT/VARIANT[/u] - To make the screwage a little more effective and possibly fix the runaway leader, adjust the Supervisor deferral cost. Instead of just one camel; 1 camel & 1 gold OR 1 camel & 2 gold OR maybe 2 camels. This will make it a little harder to avoid neighborhoods breaking up and also less attractive. If you really want to get 'nasty' allow placements in other people's incomplete neighborhoods, might be too vicious... Will try the first one soon and update...

I think if I had played this when it first came out, Yspahan would stand out as a unique dice drafting game. But there are a lot of good dice drafting games in recent times (ie Grand Austria Hotel) and Yspahan just feels a little too simple and light.

After many games with the freely available multi-player AI I was tempted to move this game up a notch. Still an excellent game, but there is a strong winning strategy (especially against the AI).

OCT 2008 Up a 1/2 point - not quite a 9 for me yet but still a favourite game.

MAR 2009. Has to be a 9 - I've played over 1,000 game against the PC (but still lose from time to time).

DEC 2012. The expansion improves the game by a) removing the easy win situation (cards/caravan) and b) introducing other new rules (take 2 cards, keep 1) and new cards. Improves game IMO. Up .2 (oh no, another (almost) 10)

Bokkensprong 16/11/12 met Luc, An en Ine (Belsele); tof spel waarin gedurende drie weken van elk zeven dagen steentjes in kraampjes van de souks worden gezet om punten te krijgen indien een "wijk" gevuld geraakt. Je kan ook steentjes weer afnemen en ze op de karavaan zetten. Geld, kamelen en verrassingskaarten bieden leuke extra mogelijkheden. Goede mix van strategie en geluk. Allicht iets minder leuk met slechts drie spelers (er is dan meer plaats op het spelbord).

RATING: 7.5
This game was fine. I liked the ability to distinguish yourself with the special power buildings, and I liked that there were different paths to follow. But it did seem like there were some strategies that relied more on dice rolls than others which is a bit unfortunate. And it often seemed like there was an obvious best choice in terms of which set of dice to take. And near the end it sort of devolved into everyone trying to knock as many of their own pieces off the board and onto the camel track as possible, which was pretty odd. This was at least partially because we kept getting rolls where we only saw three or four distinct numbers and so we weren't able to get into the more valuable areas, so that might have been a bit of an anomaly. There were definitely some interesting ideas here but there were enough kind of clunky aspects to keep this game from going beyond pretty good.

This game feels like it wants to be deeper than it actually is. There are too many options to choose from given the length of the game. Do you try to maximize your neighborhood placements, move cubes to the caravan, try to get enough income to construct buildings, or go for the powerful action cards?

It seems like a "lite" version of Puerto Rico and Caylus mixed together to me. The PR part is in the points you get for shipping goods and constructing buildings with special powers. The Caylus part is the cube placement in the buildings and the moving of the supervisor.

I've only played two three-player games so far, but they were both won by the player who built all five buildings in the order they're listed on the building card. The caravan and action cards were used to a small degree in my first game, but I don't think they had much of an effect on the outcome. In my second game, the caravan and cards were completely ignored. Is the way we perceive the value of the caravan and cards flawed? Maybe. It still felt like I was  only getting to play half the game.

Fun game,
Many different elements, but all connected smoothly.
Plays fast with little to no downtime.
There's a bit of strategie, but it's more about making coherent decisions throughout the game, then choosing a path and trying to stick to it.  You need to adjust constantly.

The rules are clear and easy to understand/explain, but, there are commun situations that are missing.  What happens when there are not more coins or camels in the stock ?

Rating after 6 4-player games. Interesting use of dice mechanic. I ended up winning the 1st time by a very wide margin thanks to the powerful two biggest buildings that let's you play an extra cube in the area, and the  2 for each completed group. 2nd time I lost by just 1 point, having only built one building (the  2 points/group).... update... have won 5 out of 6 times thus far... though the winner streak is bound to end at some point!

Another in a long line of games where you have limited action selection, but with a twist... the actions available are determined by dice.  You NEVER have enough actions to do everything that you want to do... and there are only 21 turns in a game, so every action counts.  The fact that cards have multiple uses help immensely.

Don't underestimate the power of the caravan or your buildings.  Each provides additional victory points for you and, in this game, every point counts.  The margin of victory in almost every game I've played so far has been very close.  One game had the high and low scoring players separated by only 5 points.

Download the game from Westbank gamers... even at the 'easy' setting, you'll get a great AI to play with.

Ok game, was expecting more out of it.  Not saying is a bad game but with the buzz around this game I just expected more.  I compare this to Ticket to Ride, not mechanics wise but the explaination of the rules are basic and you either help yourself or screw another player on your turn.  
Very light game and non-gamer friendly, at first rules may sound intimidating but really a basic game.

I normally hate dice but I like how they're used in Yspahan.

This is a neat little game that should appeal to the casual gamer and the more hardcore gamer.  It combines easy choices with medium strategy, so newcomers will probably lose their first game . . . but not by a lot.  I've introduced this game to my children with relative success, and I've hosted quite enjoyable game nights with this game.

I like Yspahan.  It's not T&E or Brass, but there's a lot going on here.  Yes, it uses dice, but it uses dice in a similar way to how TtR uses cards; that is to say, Yspahan uses dice in order to facilitate set collecting (the souks).  

One of the most beautiful boards I have.

Rating after one play. I need to play it a few times to see if my impression of a rather mediocre game sticks. I suspect part of the problem is that this game is terribly over-hyped, so I was expecting it to be more... well... fun. It's not a bad game, and although the dice are used well, I'm not sure if it makes the game special enough for me to own. I find the game's other mechanics to be rather pedestrian. I'd like to play it with my wife to see how she takes to it. If she likes it, it is certainly a game I'd consider getting.

RATING: 7.5
[4 plays] An interesting area majority-ish game with a unique role-selection mechanism. The roll of nine-to-twelve dice determines how many roles are available and how powerful they are. There's a chance for conflict with the supervisor, though it hasn't been used too much in the games I've played. The theme is weak, but the play is fun.

Its an interesting game.  After a few plays it seems to me that the path to victory may nearly be formulaic from a strategic point of view and your chances of winning are based on what degree your opponents can follow that path more efficiently than you or hinder you from executing it.  There are lots of ways to score points but it seems to me just one path to win.  If this continues to appear to be the case, my rating will likely fall.

Rather than directly undermining good play, the dice here make it painfully obvious instead. Combine that with a functional and static board, pacing that merely speeds up shallow play, and "buildings" so mechanical that I can never remember their names, and you've got a dud. Traded away. 

[u]Update, almost three years later[/u]

I revisited Yspahan on a whim. I still find it to be a ridiculous game. The dice don't add anything for me. They often make your moves obvious. The cards, caravan, and superviser just don't add up to anything interesting for me. At least the game is fast.

RATING: 7
The current starting player rolls a handful of dice and places these starting with the six and then low to high. Then the player selects one row that can give camels or coins, allow placement of cubes in the buildings on a particular section of the map, or allow movement of the pawn. It is then possible to buy buildings giving special abilities on your board using camels and coins. Obtaining all of a set of buildings on the map is required for scoring. Also the pawn lets you select a cube from the map to add to a separate bonus scoring track. Having a camel will preserve the cube at this point. Each player in turn does these actions based on that dice roll. Then player order changes and the next player rolls. The only weakness is that it often seemed like the obvious selection was to take the row with the most dice. Most of the strategy was in deciding when to buy buildings or using the bonus scoring. There is a certain fun factor in getting to roll lots of dice.

Semi-heavy for a such a short game. That being said, if you  can get a group to play it more then once, they will most likely enjoy it due to the good choices and mechanics. Box says Ages:8+, but I think that would have to be a very smart 8 year old. Probably shoot for 10+.

To be fair I haven't played it a lot, but beyond the clever dice mechanic I find nothing interesting about this game.

The dice mechanic for distributing actions is very novel and fun, introducing just the right amount of luck into the game.  The whole game feels very fresh, even though it could be argued that the mechanics are recycled (dice determine actions, a la Roma, the provost from Caylus) and that the theme is overused.  And the biggest factor is the very quick play time, it moves along very quickly, making for a fun-filled time, with multiple paths to victory.  I think overanalysis would kill the game, but at the right speed, this is another clear winner from Ystari.

It plays quick and is fairly light, but there is a lot going on.  Packs quite a lot of game in 30-45 minutes (once you played it a few times).

RATING: 7
After several plays

The dice rolling is a cool mechanism, but there are just too many cards in this game (rules as printed). I'm going to try and play it with handing out a free card every turn, so you have to get them from putting goods on the caravan. Makes the 'draw a card when you put a good on the caravan'-building much more interesting as well.

Lack of theme makes my friends slag it.

I don't see this as a family game, there's maybe too much going on for that. The system for the use of dice is very creative and allows the luck some room to show and forces the game into tactical level a little. There's also a lot of room for different strategies in such a fast (45min-1h) game.

RATING: 7.5
Definitely enjoyed this one. It's a Euro with a high 'fun' factor. Although the dice are plentiful, the luck seems not as bad as it might have when the box is opened. Your best move seems somewhat obvious, but the unusual meshing of mechanics seems to make me forget that. Looking forward to more.

I kind of feel that our first game of this wasn't played correctly. I don't mean that we didn't play according to the rules, I mean that we were tentative and didn't seem to be doing as much as we should have.

RATING: 6
Victory point race with a handful of ways to score and minor engine aspects. I'm really surprised the dice rolling and turn structure haven't dragged the BGG rating down more.

I've only played Yspahan against bots, but I'm rating it anyway! Bwaha! The computer game has its flaws (the interface is buggy, the 2-player game isn't a lot of fun, the 3-player game is too easily won, and the compulsory self-sacrificing kingmaking moves directed exclusively against the human player is a lazy and annoying way of doing AI programming), but kind of like Minesweeper it's a nice mindless thing to do while listening to the radio or something. Rating could go up if playing against people turns out to be quick and engaging, though I guess being deprived of camels for the first week and a half probably grates more when you're not going through the motions in front of the computer. 4-player high score: 116. (One of the bots has me beaten with 119, though. The one that's not on my left, if you catch my left-right binding drift.)

Update: Rating lowered one point for the compulsory self-sacrificing kingmaking moves.

One of the first dice drafting euro with some other mechanics in a fast paced game. However, the game is too fast, you can't accomplish lots of things. There are other problems: cards are unbalanced, most of the dice drafting decisions are obvious, more tactical than strategic because of the dice and there is little space for interaction (you can be mean with other players but you only screw yourself in the process).

Just one play, with 3.  I suspect I won't like this as much as most others.  It is clever, and I had fun, but for all the brain power applied the game was decided with one lucky roll of te dice just before a scoring round.  If a leader so emerges, I couldn't find much of a way to attack his position.

RATING: 7
Very thematic. Also, very luck based, so you don't rely to much on hard thinking, which is good from time to time. However, some strategies seem way less productives than other and therefore, it is often the luck in the draw that dictates the winner.

Plays VERY fast once you learn the rules. There are plenty of different strategies and you often times find yourself struggling to pick the best action to take.  It can be confrontational, which I think is a good thing.  It does not feel like a solitaire-type game.

Great market resource game.  You collect two kinds of currency camels and gold then use them to buy things and also have to choose when to get currency or when to set up in different markets.  Lots of luck in the game but since everyone takes turns rolling the dice it evens out.

RATING: 6
While there's an unavoidable randomness due to the dice rolls, there are also mechanisms to mitigate luck. Most noticeably, how the dice choosing works: the rolls that will net you the most resources aren't necessarily the ones that'll be the most beneficial to you. Thus, there are tactical decisions to be made each turn.

Light and short, but excellent strategic economics game with a very original dice mechanism. Yspahan is one of those rare games with dice that I really like. Oh boy, there sure are a lot of dice, at least 9 each turn! But a variety of mechanics offers different ways to deal with the luck of the dice. Take the time to build up your economy during the first week and then start powering those victory point generators during the second and third week. Don't forget the caravan. There is definitely much more going on in this game than simply throwing dice and hoping for the best rolls. The pc version is ideal to learn the basic strategies.

Novel dice mechanic, plays quick, and has a nice constant feel of not having time to do nearly everything you'd want. The caravan being so strong is a problem, and everyone needs to know that, or an automatic runaway winner emerges. The Souks cards improve it in that sense. Sadly it's another game that doesn't get much play outside the "family setting".
Update: cheap deal, bought again.

Sure, there's a healthy dose of luck, but it's very manageable. There are a number of different paths to victory and the game is just plain fun.

UPDATE: With 10 plays under my belt, it's still just as fun. It plays so quickly and the skill vs luck balance is spot on for its length. [b]9.5[/b]

This is a relatively quick game with an interesting way of using dice to add a more limited amount of randomness to the game.  The relative values of different scoring mechanisms can be difficult to intuit, and they change with the number of players and the collective approach.

It has a pretty cheerily-colored board with small wooden camel pieces.  Some of the cards and icons can be tricky to interpret at first.

I was the recipient of some terrible rolls, but that was not the cause of my ultimate downfall.  Second game, same as the first.  I really don't "get" this game at all, for some reason.

A really fun and neat twist on "dice game" combined with "card game" and board tactics.  Don't forget that little known rule (in the final section of the rulesbook) about having the option to discard a card to add a virtual die to your selected action.  I still favor the Hoist as probably my favorite buildings to have.  The two major strategies seem to be (1) acquiring Souks, and (2) casting off your cubes into the Caravan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yspahan is a very engaging "dice" game which has quite a few interesting choices to make for what is a generally a lighter game.  Dice will determine how many camels or gold can be taken, number of cubes to claim buildings in the souks, drawing of a card, or moving a supervisor.  Most times, the number of dice in the row dictate how many of the above you can take or place.  However, the supervisor moves the sum of the dice on the slot.  If you choose to draw a card, number of dice do NOT matter, you only draw one card.  Points can be scored by owning all the shops of a color in a souk, selling goods on the caravan, or through points earned by building enough special power buildings.

Neat game involving an interesting dice mechanic.  Tough choices, an okay gateway game. The first few plays were way more interesting than the last few plays. The game just didn't hold my interest after game 5 or so.

Nice, relatively light management game.  The components are nice.

The strategies are relatively obvious (the 3 x 2 things you can buy on your individual boards are grouped along each of the 3 basic strategies you can follow), and it is fun to try to make the one you have chosen work.  The way you make it work depend on the strategy chosen by the other players, which adds some replayability.  I regret that switching strategy is not so easy.

That said, it feels a little bit too thin on strategy and tactics for me to like it so much (compare Agricola,....).

Two words come to mind when thinking about Yspahan: fast and smart. It's a very open ended game with many paths to victory yet it is also blazingly fast compared to other games of this type. Don't be afraid of all thoses dices, it's not as bad as it looks! Luck is very carefully controlled in Ispahan even though the cards may be a tad too powerful. It's an excellent pick if your goal is to move new gamers up a notch from gateway games towards the really heavy stuff. The camels are fun, too bad the theme feels a bit pasted on.

While playing, pay attention to the houses on the corners of the crossroad as they are very strategic...

I really enjoyed the game because of the interaction of several game mechanics but the game managed to make a mayorities game with little to no interaction, the supervisor or whatever, is the only way people can interact in any way. When scoring came it felt kinda broken and my game group wasn't really pleased after the first time we played it. The pieces are nice, but actually the "theme" (if you can call it that) is not really well implemented, basically is a building game with a little bit of mayorities. 

I'd rather play another Euro instead, but the rating is basically for the pieces and art in the game. Actually, I felt that this game is rather expensive for what it is... so the rating shall come down... I fell into the Essen vortex and I shall never go that way!

A common Euro I didn't really needed in my collection. traded this away to someone that I hope will like this kind of games.

Another game in the long line of camel games (or to be more exact games that include camel pieces) which stretches across the desert as far as you can see.  Yspahan will however be towards the head of the caravan leading the way due to the closely fought nature of the game, the need to make the most of your options on each turn and the quick learning curve (I came last by a long way but in the third day I had the highest score of the round and I am sure if we played a game again I would probably still come last but not by so much).

The game is played fast, tension is sustained throughout, and the narrative of the game works well.  Credit to the designer and the Ystari team.

Your first impression may be that it seems over complicated or too many possible combinations but after the first round of turns everything would of clicked.  Like a camel it may appear awkward and seem to have parts where there shouldn't be but in reality this is a fast, efficient, well designed game which will see use for a long time in the future.

This is a really good and tight game BUT you have to be careful with the first few games. The rules are easy to but there also easy to get wrong the first time you play!

In the first game we didn't know that when using the intendant to send a cube to caravan you can pay a camel to send a cube from your reserve. So the caravan wasn't a useful choice for ANYONE! It removed your cubes from your points scoring souks and using it to hinder you opponnent seemed to be a waste of an action.

In our second game we played with the right rules
and I scored 48 pts using the caravan! Couple with the Caravanserai (I got a slew of cards) this was a winning strategy. 

This game is really tight. Only 21 actions. You need to make each of them count. There is some opportunism in the game but usually if you plan well you can win. In case of doubt: dra a card! They are all useful and if at that time you don't need them they can be used to augment regular action. I find the camels to be REALLY important so on your turn try to snag them!

Update to 9 after 4 plays: it plays quick. Each turn is VERY interesting. You don't get a lot of turn so there is a lot of angst to what do you need to do to scrore points. You have to be opportunist, but I think this is more important to chose the dices you need (especially camel) even if you only get 1 or 2 dice. Building the "engine": Paddock   Caravanserai   Cube on caravan demand forward think and ask you to planify 3-4 turns in advance. A very good game.

More plays might make this one sink, but I don't think so. It's aazing how the mechanics in this game almost eliminate the luck of the dice, and their effect on the gameplay. 

Update:

A good mix fo luck and strategy just might make this game Spiel Des Jahres.

A fun tactical game with a light veil of strategy that's accessible for all, and the gameplay is fast with little downtime. [b]Yspahan[/b] is the first euro I know of to employ dice in a truly unique way, and I think it is still unmatched. You've got a boatload of dice, a bunch of wooden camels, wooden gold coins, bunches of little colored wood cubes, action cards, souks, and caravans! It's a multiple area control game with some interesting twists. The game uses its theme well and the game components are fun with a lot of visual and tactile appeal. You're using the dice to create multiple choices for your turn, filling up the various souks to control them, and deciding when to send your guys (or your opponent's guys) to the caravans. There is a solid sens of game progression, and the decision points feel meaningful. The game does involve luck, but not as much as you'd think. 

We play it most often with two players, moving to a new day every time the dice changes players - this makes the game go super fast and fun. We don't change any of the other rules when playing with two people.

My family totally loves this game, so it gets played a lot.

RATING: 7.5
Fun game.  Lots of ways to win, too much to do, too little time to do it.  There are dice, but the luck component is not that large.  The dice system makes it a more tactical game because depending on how the dice fall (for your or against you), you may be better off adjusting your overall strategy.  
Also, I think it works well as a 2 player game with each person playing 2 colors.  There is not a lot of direct interaction except possibly sending someone else to the caravan, just disallow that for your opposite color.

2010-01-01: Bought as a gift. It seems to be a smooth game in terms of mechanics, but its beauty has eluded me. Perhaps I should have to play it much more, however, I fail to discover any excitement in filling warehouses (understand: putting wooden cubes here and there). Few more plays and I'll be converted to amerithrasher.

A surprising game that did not look that impressive but has some interesting mechanics.  You roll dice and unless you roll all numbers not all areas are available for placement.  You have special cards you can use that provide in game benefits.  And you can kick a player out of a location and put them into caravans.  At the end of the game it can score for you.  It is a majority control/area control game with some minor "take that" mechanics.  I found it very fun, with interesting mechanisms but not very thematic.  Another gem in that old Ystari line.

9/2006 Played once and there's clearly more to explore in this game.  There's several options and many winning strategies depending on the situation.

7/2007  Played the computer game several times and again with 4 players.  There's a major flaw in the randomness of the dice: You might be lucky to get a bunch of camels early and a flying start or be trailing with a lesser die roll.  Rating down: 7 -> 4.

Interesting game with more thought required than it seems at first glance. Took several plays to 'get it', with rating rising from barely a 6 to over 7 (could go higher).

This was my second Ystari game (after Caylus) and the one that confirmed my love for this publisher. There's never enough time to do everything in this game, so every turn is a difficult decision. Unfortunately, my family seem to play a fairly basic strategy of just going for the most soukhs, so the game - played with my group - is often not as strategic as it could be.

We played it three times in a row.  Pros:  Fast game, interesting use of dice that adds an element of chance with strategy, my wife likes the looks of the game and mechanics, many options/strategies.  Cons:  seems to be suffering from the "runaway leader" problem or something like it -- if you make mistakes in the beginning it is almost impossible to catch up, one could tell who the winners and losers were going to be already in the middle of the game, usually this is a gamebreaker for me.

[Played 2 times]
Simple rules, but nothing exciting.
While the dice are "shared", luck has still a big role: if you roll different numbers, all players will benefit from it; if you roll a lot of the same kind, you're advantaged (and have a brainbless choice).
Distribution of the quarters seeems off as well: the rare one is way too rare, while the second rarest is small compared to how many times it's allowed to depoly cubes there.
Bonus cards are wildly imbalanced too.

1598. Yspahan the fair becomes the capital of the Persian empire. Thus, being placed at the center of the world, the city enjoys a period of cultural and economic blossoming. The cities and villages of the region intend to take advantage of this expansion. Caravans loaded with goods and jewels set out for the desert, bearing the promises of a radiant future....
The players embody merchants trading with Yspahan. Meaning to take advantage of the coming of the Shah’s supervisor, they score points by placing their merchandise in the right shops, by sending them to the caravan, and by constructing buildings.

Decent dice game. Like the theme and the options on how to get points. Not any real snowball affect, you can still pull a victory in the last few days with some luck though. Typically, for me, if a game is sensitive to luck, then its great if you have options if you get 'stuck' with certain dice, but those options become progressively limited as the week goes by.

Honest and elegant game fun, without being shallow.

Plays quick although you have a lot of options. Playing is easy but winning isn't. Elegant 2-player variant available. Colorful material makes this game also appealing to sporadic players.

First game in history that proved that a game with dice doesn't have to be stupid and still can be quite fun. 

After 22 plays, and 7 years this game stays a remarkably fast, light and deep game. That is a unique combination. The game stays fresh and doesn't get boring.

Rating based on two real plays and several against computer bots.  Good fun, with a somewhat strong element of luck, and yet some agonizing, non-obvious decisions...

UPDATE: after over 70 game plays I'm starting to realize that luck plays a pretty good part in this game.  If you're lucky enough to get enough camels and gold at the beginning to get some buildings up - then you're sitting pretty good.  Just like getting lucky enough to get a Prefecture up right away in San Juan - doesn't mean you're a guaranteed winner, but sure gets you off on the right foot.  Still ok fun... just a lot less interesting than it was initially.

A bit of stumbling but played pretty well for first time and we liked it a lot.  Both of us looking forward to discovering more as we log more plays.  Really glad I chose this one.  (played w/variant: only 8 white dice, each round first player gets 2 moves, building is not option, instead it's a 4th action.) Played 2nd game next day, even more fun!

If you have to use dice, this is the way to do it.  All the fun of rolling, and you rarely get screwed by dumb luck.  None of us have figured out how to make good use of the caravan track, so that might be a bit of a flaw.  But overall this is a fun game, and I like that it has a fixed number of turns, no chance of getting stuck in something that drags on interminably.

Wonderful dice game that manages to have lots of options and still remain fast & breezy. With all of those choices, this is more of a gamer's dice game than a family dice game, but in that respect it succeeds. You see people win with various strategies, which is always a good thing. To some extent you need to adopt your strategy to the way the dice roll, but less than in other dice games. You really can go into this one thinking you're going to pursue the caravan strategy, or the building/upgrade strategy, or the city strategy, etc.

While I see the merit of the game mechanics (e.g. the way the dices are used to produce actions), I wasn't too excited about it at first play.

After seeing it on the shelves at my local game store back in 2006 or so, Yspahan bounced around in my head for four years before I picked up a copy -- something about it grabbed me. And I'm glad for that: This is an excellent, and surprisingly quick, game with a lot of interesting decisions.

The use of dice -- the tower -- is superb, and it drives a lot of fun choices and options while providing a balanced amount of chance. The end result is a fun game that's easy to pick up and which moves along briskly.

I do wish that instead of the three main boards, they'd just made one larger board that incorporated the tower and caravan; it's a bit fiddly as-is. Apart from that, the components are quite nice.

I enjoyed it and really loved the dice mechanic, but for some reason it left me feeling a little flat strategy wise. I think I felt like the game required solid strategic planning, but the dice created a HUGE random factor, so that while on their own both "sides" were interesting and well realized, when put together it just didn't gel as well as I would like. Due to the dice being used the way they were, I rarely felt as though I had too many meaningful decisions to make.

Another great example of what a Euro should be like. You've got all the standard stuff - easy rules leading to interesting strategies, multiple paths to victory, various factors to balance which is good in itself, but not enough to make a fun game. Then the dice and card mechanisms add in enough variation to keep you on your toes and enough excitement to make it feel like a game instead of a maths exercise.

A gem of a game ignored by many players.  Yspahan suffered from being published right after Caylus.  Yspahan wasn't heavy like Caylus and it had dice.  Players didn't understand the camel track or how to properly use the supervisor.  This game is much deeper than it appears.  Non-gamers like this game because it is not overly confrontational, but gamers like it because the best player always wins.  Plays quickly.

At times this game seems to play itself, especially with regards to dice choices or which building to build.  I like how the dice rolls add a random element to the game.  However, the caravan track feels superfluous.  Gorgeous game.  Needs a lot of work and re-editing to be worth buying.

[i]Yspahan[/i] is a game in which you are primarily focused on maximizing your own score as opposed to screwing others.  It is rarely if ever possible to block an opponent while advancing your own cause (exceptions to this are timing the scoring of the caravan and possibly sending someone to the caravan at the end of a round).  If you approach the game with this in mind, it is quite enjoyable.  It plays light and fast and it is always fun to roll a handful of dice.

This is a lovely little game that is quick, but requires a lot of decision making. As dice games go, this is pretty much exemplary. Yes, there is an element of luck, but it is so well tempered by the 'tower' that there is a lot of tactical and strategic play. Works best as a 4-player, I think. With two, it's too easy to get gold and camels (build the cheap buildings), so you can easily populate the souks without worrying about the supervisor. Be warned: its large box suits its depth, but belies its short play time. First-timers may be left feeling a little short changed for the money they paid. All I can say is: keep playing. This game rewards repeated play.

Rating based on one play with 3 and one with 4 players, which I won.  Fun game.  I really like this one.  It is much more strategic than being a dice game would suggest.  Looks nice, very simple rules, but has enough options to allow for multiple strategies.  I'd love to play it some more.

Initial rating:
Good game, better than expected. I've read all the reviews, and thought: "guess it's just another nice, entertaining, but average euro, I'll let this one pass by". But after sitting in on a session, I decided to buy it anyway. 

Why? Because it's actually better than the "average euro": it plays fast despite lots of options, there is enough player interaction, and it has a nice lot's-of-dice-but-not-so-much-luck mechanic that's feels new instead of a rip off (closest thing I recall is the dice mechanism used in Roma, and even that one isn't close)

Cons: 
It's pretty low on theme, combined with the  "various possibilities to gain VP's" that make it sound dull. So I still have to see how I rate it in a year. Sounds a bit like a good Knizia, doesn't it?

Having the same cubes for goods, "special houses" AND your personal point counters at least don't hide the "cube pushing" feel games like this have. So it's kinda honest in it's themelessness....

NL: Vlot spel, tactisch, niet te moeilijk en toch leuk.

Really hits the sweet spot for me in regard to play time and depth.  Great use of dice, simple turn options, and very satisfying euro strategy feel in a quick game.  I love the multiple paths to points and trying to anticipate dice probabilities and other player's choices several turns ahead.  The art and theme are a bit bland, but they certainly don't cause any major problems.

Although dice are involved, I don't really feel that there is much of a luck factor.  I think this is because the dice are shared.  It isn't always clear whether placing in the caravan is an advantage or disadvantage, which adds to the depth of play.

There's a lot to like about the game; the risk-taking aspects, the angst that gets generated, upgrading your "technology"%u2026 However I find that the game is fairly linear, and the caravan track can get downright broken if only one or two players bother using it. Also it is almost always better to get camels/gold whenever possible, the points given by the markets should probably be a little higher to balance the actions better. Overall a great design, but it is a game that forces players to go down a specific path rather than the other way around.

11-2007 A very enjoyable light/middle-weight euro.  It's basically an economic optimization / area-control game but with a somewhat unique dice mechanism (actually part of it may have been borrowed from Tonga Bonga) that drives the engine.  Players place their goods into buildings and will score if they can fill the entire building.  There is room for some nastiness (removing a player's goods from a building) but it takes up a precious action and moves that player's marker onto the caravan track which can also score points (a nice catch-up mechanism and a possible strategy since I believe you can eradicate yourself to the caravan).

9-10-2011 UPDATE: The game is losing some of it's appeal.  Knocked down rating 1/2 a point.  Still keeping it high for introducing such a great way to use dice.  Too bad Ystari's record has been somewhat dull since this one.

I enjoy games that find interesting ways to utilize dice and Yspahan is no exception.  i like the way the scoring works and the caravan provides an interesting way to score.  several paths to accumulate victory points and a nice blend of strategy and tactics.

I continue to think that despite its fairly high ranking that it is not fully appreciated.  One of the first games to use dice in different ways.

Really? I don't see it. The randomness is not all that offensive to me; it just makes the options different each turn. And yes, there's strategy here, different paths to victory... sorta. There's still some main-line things you have to do, it seems. I think part of the problem is you have enough stuff, frankly. You can build all your buildings, and still send cubes to the caravan, and still supply shops. No doubt doing that [i]well[/i] involves skill, but it doesn't really involve tough decisions.

Come to think of it, you know what that reminds me of? Backgammon.

Yspahan manages to combine 'relaxed, quick' play, with still having interesting decicions and a feeling of accomplishment at the end. Furthermore, games are usually very close.

A supergame for 2, 3 and 4 players.

Interesting game. It entertained me but I never fully engaged. There is such a high risk factor with the completion of all but the easiest of the regions, especially with the nearly cruel usage of the pawn that evicts ownership to the camel track. I'd play it again but I wouldn't hunt it down.

Probably another game I didn't give a fair chance to, especially since it was a Spiel winner back in the day, but the gameplay seemed so antiquated and old-feeling that I couldn't be persuaded to give it another go.  I think even games considered great once upon a time can go stale in the light of newer designs and I think this title is proof of that.  I just think that some of the fighting for majority control across the board and some of the mechanics have been refined and perfected in more current designs, so why would I ever choose this title?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
An enjoyable area-control game wherein players attempt to control areas of a city.  The game has a unique mechanism for deciding where players can go; a single player rolls a set of dice, and then the dice are arranged on a board with six open spaces in sequential order.  The number of dice in each space determines how many moves into each area of the city a player can make (or how much gold, or other items, a player can get); this is a great mechanism for adding uncertainty into an area-control game, as what you can do on your turn is dictated by random chance (and your playing order).  This is relatively light as far as area-control games go (it's no El Grande), but there are enough choices that one must use tactics and strategy to win.  Definitely a keeper, though luck does play a large roll.

Pick sets of dice to improve your operation, control the bazaar and sell your goods to the caravan for most points.

Plays: 2.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Medium strategy game.
# of players: 3.
Playing time: 90 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources in the bazaar and on the caravan.
Randomness: Low - dice, but you pick sets to use.

Replayability: None, I don't enjoy efficiency engines.
Fun: This isn't a game, it's a math problem (see also: Agricola).
Memorability: None, it's a VP engine.

Thematic integration: Decent.
Components: Decent. Cameeples are a bonus.

Who will like this: Number crunchers.

This game has something that is missing in a lot of Euros - a giant handful of dice!  Rolling dice gives the game a different feel than many other games of its type.  The basic choice to be made in many rounds is whether to take the action that lets you do more, or the action that you really need to do this turn.  It's good fun, and I love rolling dice.  However, the game seems to wear itself out a little soon, and while this game debuted at a 7 for me, it's since declined to a 5.

First play was mildly disappointing. The supervisor mechanic seemed weak, and was used very few times. Most of the time you can score more points by taking a souk than you can recover by interfering with an opponent's souk, except for the big 12-pointer. Played this with my wife and son; she's not a big fan of "weasel games", which is her term for any game where a major option is to take points away from another player without advancing your own position at the same time.

Nem egy rossz játék, de az idő már elment felette és nem vált klasszikussá. Talán azért is, mert a kockadobásoktól való függés frusztráló. Többször is előfordulhat, hogy nem jól jön ki a lépés, persze ilyenkor is lehet lapot húzni a kockával, de az is vagy hasznos vagy nem. Túl nagy mélységet sem érzek benne, egyszerűen kell a teve, pénz, kártya, házakat építeni, amikor ez nem megy, kell néha a táblára építeni és sima a győzelem. Nekem legalábbis így ment. Ez így nem túl izgi.

RATING: 7
8.5 after about 10 games using the very good PC version from West Park Gamers.  Yspahan is a good, quick and easy to learn game with interesting mechanics, different to most other games I've played.  I think it would make a good gateway game for non-gamers.  It reminds me a bit of blend of Yahtzee (the dice) Puerto Rico (the buildings and economic system) and Taj Mahal (focusing on a strategy).  The caravan strategy seems to be dominant but it weakens if more than one player focuses on it, which indicates inherently good balance in the game's design.  The outcome seems a bit too dependent on good luck with some early dice rolls when you are the first player, which prevents me from giving it a higher score. The PC version is a good way to try before you buy and/or practise your game, and its quite addictive! I've yet to try this with 2 or 3 players.
Revised to a 7.5. I still think that this is a fun game with a good application of lots of dice rolling, but there doesn't seem to be much that players can do to check the a player that gets a few good dice rolls early in the game. Being unlucky in a 10 minute computer game is no big issue, but being unlucky in a 45 minute board game agains 3 other players is not as appealing compared to other games. Probably for the same reason, there doesn't seem to be much tension in the game, although this might improve with more experienced opponents.

RATING: 10
Fantastic game. Good duration, good amount of thinking yet doesn't leave you burnt out. Very cool dice mechanism to determine the resources that enter the game. Cool interaction of mechanics where things can be used both in your favour and then used by others to work against you. Like the Supervisor and caravan, the rules for the cube placement into the souks or the buildings you choose to build.

The luck adds even more to this in my opinion. The dice can be lucky for you, delivering a very rewarding "Yes!" moment, then they can take that a way with an "Oh Sh*t!" moment. It's never something that leaves you feeling like you lost (or won) the whole game from the dice, maybe just took a wee hit on the way. Who wants to play a game where you can work out exactly how to win before you play anyway......

This is very addictive. There are strategies to try and different ways to win, the dice (and how others play) may just cause you to evolve from what you were doing to something new. Each game is different and I think this will add to the longevity of this game as a favourite.

Plays well with 2, using the official variant.

Very enjoyable with 4, different dynamics completely.

I think this game will get a lot of table time with my wife and I and our friends. This would be harder to explain to non-gamers.

The WestparkGamers PC version is great to play. Beats me almost every time and still I return for more floggings..... Such is Yspahan.

This game is a quick and easy to learn. There are a variety of paths to victory. The use of cards and dice adds a nice level of luck. In the game players have to choose what's best for them based on the dynamic information each turn. The components are nice and the overall game is amazing.

Yspahan is a really neat game. It really is the poster child of dice games for Euro lovers. The mechanisms, theme, and components don't really do a whole lot to draw you in, but once you get to playing, you see how fun and addictive it becomes. There's different strategies, some push your luck, but ultimately everything feels relatively controllable and balanced. The very definition of an oldie but a goodie in my book.

Grand Austria Hotel fired this for me.

RATING: 8
Only played this 2-player so far. Really enjoyed it! Wanted to play more but had to leave it. Works well as 2-player but keen to see how it works with more. Plays quickly, lot's of decisions - despite the large number of dice, the luck is well balanced out, so you do get to plan - the options you have each turn are nicely frustrating - for that, it is like Caylus.  

Update 1: Now played several times with four players, and completely love this game. One of my faves at the time of writing...

Update 2: Now strugling with the camel variability - I need to work an alternate strategies and have some success to rate higher - seems a bit broken...

Update 3: I think that I need to recognise sour grapes over losing the odd game - still working at best optimisation, but this is an interesting multi-strategy game.

Acquired Dec 29th 2007 - New

One of the better games of 2007.  A great use of the dice.  Many difficult decisions, do you place followers, get gold or camels, go onto the caravan, or build up you special ability board?  Expensive for what you get, but I love it for the fact is sets up easy, rules are somewhat busy, but very easy to grasp.  Just the right amount of playing time as well, average game for 4 players was arond 45 minutes.  This one is tops on my list.  Only downfall, is no system for breaking ties.  Some use money or camels, which seems to work if you all agree (but it's not written in the rules).  Between this and Notre Dame, they are the best for the class of 2007

RATING: 7
Yspahan is a solid family style game. The dice action in the game gives the game a good crossover appeal to those gamers brought up on simple, luck filled games yet there is enough to think about that the Euro influences can clearly be felt. 

I do like the game as it plays quickly once you get into the flow. There is a bit of a thought though that the game is a bit simplistic... maybe that's not necessarily a bad thing in terms of the rule set and the game play itself but in terms of the actual strategic/tactical decision making there is a slight niggling feeling of "is that it?" sometimes. Depending on the roll of the dice the decisions are somewhat dictated to you by what quantity of dice are currently the most plentiful when it happens to be your turn. There certainly is some luck in the game but that can be dealt with to some extent by choices you make in trying to build up your weaknesses by playing to your strengths... a common feature in many Euro games... and one that can be felt in the mechanisms of Yspahan as well. 

All in all this isn't a game I would say is quite at the level of top tier games but it IS a good solid family oriented game playable really with almost all ages and for that it deserves a bit of extra credit. A solid 7 rating for now and that could probably climb a half point or so with further play.

RATING: 7
Can die rolls be done right in a game? Yspahan is the classic game frequently said to do this and quite successfully I must say. The rolled dice determine the actions available to the players and the strength of each action (the number of camels or gold that may be taken or the number of the shops that may be set up in the different neighborhoods). In addition, the way the dice are organized make more valuable neighborhoods less probable, adding yet another dimension to the decision space.

One potential concern is that the die rolls may make some actions clearly better than others, giving the player who happen to start that turn an unfair advantage by chance. On the other hand, small dice can still be used to send goods from shops to the caravan with a good return in victory points so perhaps this will even out. I may prefer Ystari Games' Amyitis (goods and caravans without dice) but Yspahan is a very good game too.

Update: Sold because I was worried that lucky die rolls when you happen to start a round may be too decisive.

I'd give this more and more tries as there is a lot of different tactics to adopt.  I like the game theme and the difficulty in the choice following dice roll.  I see little value in the additional dice unless you have gold to spare or the hail mary roll is required.

RATING: 6
Yspahan packs an impressive amount of strategy into such a short playtime.  What I like most about it is that there are three distinct paths to victory, and the way those three paths interact in a metagame really adds a lot of depth.  In that sense, the game plays best with those who are familiar with it, but it is also a great game to introduce to new players.  The dice system is very cool, and the balance of everything is really interesting.

Yspahan has slipped slightly in my rankings, and thus has seen less plays, since the release of Notre Dame.  These two games fill very similar places in my mind, and Notre Dame being a little fresher and deeper seems to win out more often than not.  The biggest fault of Yspahan is its price.  For a small game, it's quite expensive.  I imagine the only reason it wasn't in one of the Ystari small boxes (Mykerinos size) was that the dice are an expensive component, and the big box was necessary for the price they had to charge.  Still, Yspahan is a very good game and I'm glad that I own it.

RATING: 9
The active player rolls 9 dice, and the rolls are distributed along 6 rows. The active player chooses a row to execute some actions, then the next player chooses from the remaining dice to do an action. Actions are earn gold, place cubes in one of four areas, earn camels, move the supervisor or pick up a card. The number of cubes/gold/camels earned are the dice rolled on that row. Players can build up their player mat to earn VPs and give them special benefits. This is a very fun game, and you can pursue different strategies, depending on what you roll or are left with. I think it is one of the best games of 2006.

Meh.  Nothing really new here.  I liked the dice system in general, but I would like to see it used in a more innovative design.

Though it has a lot of things going on for it, it's quite an easy game to learn.  It's amazing that it packs that much content in a timeframe of an hour or less.  Its artwork is ok, though the colors chosen could have been more distinctive.

Update:  
No complaints about gameplay, but the drab-looking board and the theme do not help it much.

In danger of being replaced by recent games that use both dice and allocation such as Bruges.

RATING: 7
First impression: This rating comes only from playing the (excellent) PC-version of the game against AI. The game seems a good game with enough interesting decisions to be made during the game. There is quite a bit luck involved on how the dices are rolled, especially with 4 players. However, the game is a good one and not too complex so it can be played with non-gamers also.

Played more than 150 games by now (not including PC Games), and enjoy to play many more (in any configurations, including 2-players). I don't know why but I like throwing this bunch of dices, analyze one second and act. Quick play, luck-driven but interesting paths to victory. There is much more than at the first look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very good, innovative dice game, in which luck is a minor factor. The luck comes in the spread of the numbers, rather than the amounts rolled. The dice are used to create area dominance and gain resource (camels, money) that allow for the pursuit of other strategies or to supplement the area dominance. There are several ways to minimize the luck element (cards, special buildings, other game options like the supervisor). Most of the time the best player wins at this.

Another cube placement game from Ystari. Somewhat heavier than the average family game. The camel bits are cute but otherwise there's nothing exceptional, interesting, or challenging here.

Good game with original and interesting mechanics. I especially like the way dice are used. Yspahan does not take long to play but demans players to make tough decisions. The more I play it the better it gets. Unfortunately the components are not that good: the board is too small to my taste and so are the cubes and cards, artwork is ok at its best.

RATING: 7
Either a heavy dice game or a very luck-influenced tactical game, Yspahan is a quite interesting concoction: each day during three weeks a throw of a handful of dice dictates the amount of resources available for all players to make business (camels, money, shops to fill on the board). The dice are sorted by value into groups, and players have then got to choose the group that suits best either to pick up the resources, to pick up a card with a nice action, or to move an inspector who stops by a shop and sends the stone in this shop to the "caravans" (a score track). With gold and camels special buildings are built, which give privileges to the lucky player who bought them.

Even though the basic mechanism of the game is transparent, the management of the throws has got to be extremely skillful. Especially when the first throws don't give many camels or gold. This can be frustrating at some points, since there aren't enough throws to say that luck evens out.

RATING: 6.4
Si basa sul lancio di dadi (un po' come Kingsburg), quindi con forte presenza della fortuna, malgrado ciò le dinamiche non sono male. La strategia verte sulla scelta dei quartieri da 'occupare' settimanalmente, ma si può scegliere di ignorare i quartieri privilegiando tessere benefit o arricchendosi con denari e cammelli. Un gioco carino, veloce, che però secondo me alla lunga risulta ripetitivo e monotono. Oltretutto il gioco presenta un bug che annulla ogni strategia e bellezza del gioco spingendo i giocatori a movimenti continui del pedone con troppi bonus derivanti dal 'terzo tabellone' di gioco. Evitate di giocare con giocatori che applicano questa strategia sistematicamente rovinando il gioco.

An achingly difficult game with a diverting dice mechanic. There's an awful lot in Yspahan to keep track of, and the crucial not-enough-turns-to-do-what-I'd-like concept is cleverly melded into days and weeks. Personally, I can't see what it takes to actually be [i]good[/i] at Yspahan, but I'm willing to play a lot of it to find out.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]After one play I was interested in playing again and had that opportunity this summer. Wow, was I disappointed. First off I was playing with some sharks at this game and never even had a chance, but I was honestly bored while playing. The game ended up feeling like a bunch of disjointed mechanics crammed to get her to make a game. There was very little excitement while taking your turn, none of the actions felt satisfying. The buildings powers are quite pedestrian and the area control relies on certain dice being rolled. I'm not someone that needs a strong theme in games, but at least make an effort. 

I've seen this recommended as a family game and couldn't disagree more. Just because a game can be easily learned doesn't mean it's a great family game. Yspahan is dry as toast and not a game I could see kids getting into. I don't have any interest in playing this again. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I enjoyed my play of this game, but it is not a game I feel the need to seek out. Drafting from the dice pool was fun, but the choices you had to make seemed to be obvious most of the time.Most of the "difficult" decisions came when you were the one who rolled the dice and therefore got to choose first.

Overall I had fun, the game played quick and had enough light decisions to make it interesting. I think this would make a great, light family game that introduces some different game mechanics in a very easy to learn manner.[/i]

Novel use of dice, so bonus marks for that, though it is a little random. Very much a Euro in that it's simply a bag of mechanics that have nothing to do with the theme. Not really my cup of tea but it's okay and I'll play it if others want to.

An appealing implementation of dice, allowing them to convert into action points for building to different sections of the board, with fallback options available. The action cards provide interesting options and bonus points, and one of the attractions of the game revolve around deciding when action cards are primary options and when they're fallback options. Add a strategic option to forsake buildings by investing in the caravan, which can multi-score, and you have a lot of things to manage and decide within a 30 minute game, with dashings of luck to spice things along.

A set number of actions per game. Has a Euro-feel coupled with a German-style game feel. Some action selection, some resource management, some card management, some area control, dice rolling, and a lot of potential to mess with other players' plans.

A solid design. Many options. Okay 2 player. Better with more.

What I like:
- Excellent, creative dice mechanic 
- 2 paths to victory (souks and caravan)
- Unusual theme, with cute wooden camels

What I don't like:
- I wish there were even fewer opportunities for screwage
- A bit tricky to teach, for its weight

3-4p games have taken 75-90 minutes, but should speed up somewhat after everyone knows the game. I think the weight of 2.4 is slightly low. I would give it a 2.6.

For some reason, not an intuitive game for me, but I am growing to like it. 6P in and I just now feel might be learning how to be effective. Do not undervalue the buildings, or the Caravan. No one in my group is using the caravan effectively yet, I feel.

A nice majority game. Has an ideal game length! Even with it's dice rolling and card draw it remains a game for gamers too! It may be too complex for the SdJ award.
Update(13.03.16): with the existing special strategy that is overpowered, I have to lower my rating.

Lots of paths to victory and the right amount of luck. Although I find it is lacking some interaction and the dice mechanic is sometimes annoying. I was really looking forward to this one, since I love Ystari and I tried to like it, but I found it very dull to play.

RATING: 7
A nice dice drafting game that has elements of area control and resource management.  Stopping someone who is highly skilled at the caravan strategy is almost impossible if you don't play by the rule tweeks found in the expansion, which can easily be implemented without the expansion.  Yspahan is a fun game with vibrant colors and fairly easy gameplay.  I'm not sure if I would want to play it weekly, but it is a game I plan on keeping.

This game has a unique way of introducing dice into the game: allowing people to claim certain numbers after the dice have been rolled.  That said, it still has the randomness of a dice game, and I didn't find the cube placement mechanic to be that fun.  This game definitely has a "dominant strategy"--the caravanserai--and the more players that partake in that strategy, the stronger it is.

I got to play at my local meetup today and when my fiancee pick the game up and asked me to play I was delighted. I vaguely remember this game to be an above average game from browsing the BGGs and some people still recommend this game in the recommendation forum.

After the play I was glad the game was over. Mike, our third player, discovered the Caravan draw card strategy and he just kept on sending his goods there and he burnt me and my fiancee both by around 50 points at the end of the game.

I feel the strategy might be very linear when we all fight for the caravan right so I don't think it's a game to be owned and played again. I am glad that I had the chance to though.

To fix the game they should make a limit to how many cards can be played per turn.

Clever implementation using dice produces tough choices of possible actions. Runs about the right length, maybe even slightly too short as there's not enough time to do everything you want to!

Official 2-player rules are available (maybe not as good with only 2 though)

Fun quick game that I find difficult to solve, which makes me want to play it more! 3-4 player range (2 is not that good) prevents it from hitting the table as that range is usually satisfied by games I prefer (such as Brass).

Edit: After a few plays it seems the caravan strategy is dominant.

I love Metropolys so was keen to try another Pauchon design, and it's similarly quick-moving, middleweight and Knizian, if not quite as good. I thought the dice were going to be used for worker placement a la Kingsburg or Alien Frontiers, but it's actually quite different. I played a 4p and a 3p in the same evening and enjoyed both, though the replayability may be limited as it seems there are only a couple of strategic paths.

EDIT: replayed 4 years on, and it's evident that my taste has changed. Found it fairly boring - the usual Euro formula of 'clever' action selection mechanic + a handful of paths to victory + engine-building/optimisation - theme.

Played this one for the first time last night (3 player game, 2 experienced and myself). If you like non-cutthroat, we all do our own thing and in the end we'll see who has the most score games (ie. Ticket to Ride), then this game is for you. Winning is based mostly on luck of the roll. The Supervisor was only used once by me to foil another player's monopoly. The Caravan board was hardly used. There was no reward or sense of failure once the game was over. The person who won actually left the table while we scored the game and was told later that he had one the game. His response was "oh" and that was the end of it. For non-aggressive types only!

RATING: 6
While there were aspects I liked about this game, the strategy seemed to center around the accumulation of camels. If you didn't have camels you were in a real bad spot. The way the dice and selection mechanics work, waiting for your dice roll turn to get camels when you don't have them makes for an unfun game.

That game can be deceiving at first look because it looks like an all luck game with almost no strategy du to the amount of dice. In fact there is luck, but the basis of this game is to manage that luck the best way you can. So it becomes realy more strategic that way. The price of the game is a little bit expensive for the material involved. The rules are clear and easy to explain. For those who don't like any kind of luck in a game, this is realy not for you. But for those who likes a easy to mid-range game that will be enjoyed by the whole family, this game is for you.

Ce jeu a une apparence trompeuse car ça ressemble à un jeu ou la chance joue un rôle prédominant et qu'il y a peu de stratégie dû à la présence des nombreux dés. Bien qu'il y ait effectivement de la chance d'impliquée,la base du jeu est degérer cette chance de la meilleure façon. Le prix du jeu est trop élevé pour le type de matériel présenté. Les règles sont claires et facile à expliquer. Pour ceux pas les jeux ou il y a une part de chance, passer votre tour, ce jeu n'est pas pour vous. Par contrer, pour ceux qui aime les jeux familial de difficulté basse à moyenne, ce jeu est pour vous.

A nice game with the right mix of luck and pure strategy, and it provides a decent range of choices each turn, but the attempt at a theme was wasted: it should have admitted being an abstract game from the beginning, since none of the game mechanics and alledged theme elements make any sense whatsoever in relation to the scoring system.

Yspahan almost always feels like it's over too soon. It can be difficult to find a good strategy in such a short amount of time, but it also seems like there are at least a few different paths to victory. Some players will be fans of the camel track and others will prefer to place cubes on the main board, or you can have a mix of both. The dice have a very small chance of messing things up, especially since players will be rewarded with cards if they can't complete any other action. The cards are perhaps the most random aspect of the game, definitely only useful on a case by case basis.

Overall: Yspahan isn't perfect, but it is simple, fast and elegant. A worthy addition to my collection.

RATING: 8
Easy to play, easy to teach and fast to play. You can try different strategies and every action is not completely obvious even though sometimes you can get very lucky. Expansion adds some nice new cards and minor rule changes that make the game a bit more enjoyable. For a short euro that can be played with a wide range of people , this game definitely has it's place in my collection.

edit. 7.5 -> 8 Especially the two player is very enjoyable since it's so fast and fluid, yet offers maybe a bit more depth. Overall different strategies seem to work quite well. Player interaction seems to be quite nice, not too much hitting others but it's not a multiplayer solitaire either.

edit. 2p-rating= 8, 3p rating=7 and 4p rating=6. 2-player is the best and I don't really care to play it with more players. I could play it with three but certainly not with four players. Additional players above two just means that the game takes longer, there is little effect in the gameplay.

An interesting points scoring game. Players roll dice, which determine the available actions then take actions in turn from them, over 21 turns. Every 7 turns players score points, some one-off, and some that score in each scoring phase.
It is fairly easy to learn, though there are some bitty but important rules it is easy to forget. There is a nice balance of luck nd skill and it plays quickly, but there probably isn't very much depth, as certain combos are just better than others.

RATING: 7
Yspahan is a euro of the days of old with few moving parts and a cohesive structure, and one where randomness can be mitigated enough to not sour your disposition. Most of my plays were the base game, and only recently with the expansion that seeks to balance the strength of the caravan. I would venture to say that there is no reason to ever play without the expansion (if you own it) as it adds some new cards and new ways to utilize your cubes. One card I like in particular allows you to take (what you deem) un-usable cubes and convert them to resources, which was a significant boon at the right time. The game does not feature ~heavy~ player interaction, per se, but the central board, the caravan, and surveyor mechanisms all play into a semi-interactive feel. It is not in-your-face, but it is certainly there, and you are vying for control of the board all the same.

This is a game that strikes a balance between filler and lightweight game: interesting enough to give seasoned gamers some crunchy decisions and fanciful enough to draw newbies in. Overall, my plays of Yspahan were sharp and delightful romps that I quite enjoyed.

(+) Quick playing, smooth turns with cohesive mechanisms.
(+) Varying amount of strategies to pursue.
(+) Randomness can be mitigated (discard a card to add a dice action, pay gold to have better choices, or use card effects to supplement your turn).

(-) The gameplay can feel like you are coerced to investing in others' strategies to keep up with them (i.e. the Caravan). Although this is notably turned down in the expansion, if only a handful of people monopolize the caravan, the difference in scores will clearly show it.
(-) The disadvantage of being last is felt more strongly in this title than some others, as your best choices are few and far between.
(-) It may lack longevity/depth.

Quite possibly the only game that uses dice for resources where I genuinely enjoy the game. Rolling many camels does give players too big of an advantage and constantly rolling one camel can be disasterous. Otherwise, I'd rate much higher. Regardless, it is still a very good game and one of the few dice heavy games I'd consider a "gamer's" game. Multiple scoring options, many things to do and consider. Quick playing, tactical and fun.

Interesting exercise in resource management, but like St. Petersburg, wonder if the fun is just is discovering an optimal path in the initial few plays.  Once discovered/established the game comes down to luck for the die rolls (card draw in St. Petersburg) or cards purchased.

RATING: 8
After the first play, my opinion of the this game improved.

There seems to be a good balance of strategies between getting the building, filling the town and putting your own pieces on the caravan.  (And the cards are a decent part of any strategy.)

Still there is definite randomness that can that may irk some people.

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Rating up a tad after another play.  This offers a nice, quick, fun ride with a few interesting decisions.  May rise more.  Awful lot of dice luck and the decisions aren't agonizing, but it won't take long at all to play and was a fun ride.  I'd certainly play again.

UPDATE: Rating back down a hair.  I just can't see that the white caravan supervisor figure and the caravan track are likely enough to ceom into play.  The ability to toss a camel away to keep from having a shop emptied makes it a nearly worthless attack, and trying to push yourself up there seems iffy.  It would have been nice for this to be a whole other strategic path.  Still, quick and fun.

--Oct2006-- Very fine use of dice.  Almost worth owning for that fact alone - yet that won't bring this to the table six months from now.  In my first play, there was a whole subsystem (the caravan) that didn't get much use:  I'm interested in exploring that space a bit more.

A játék, amely megmutatja, hogy a dice rolling mechanika sokkal mélyebb is lehet, mint azt valaki elsőre gondolná.
Igazán mókásak a kis fa teve jelzők, a játék elemeit úgy általában elég apróra szabták, de ez még valahogy jó is (kis helyigény, kompakt táblás játék). Persze a doboz ehhez képest óriási, de ez már marketing :)
A játékélmény igazán kellemes, lehetőségek gondolkodtatóak, de szerencsére nem túlzottan mély, ezért egyszerre nehéz és könnyed is. Amolyan középhaladó nehézségű.

Jobban megismerve, azt mondom, hogy 3-4 fővel élvezetes igazán. Ketten talán túl száraznak mondanám, hiszen azért eléggé leredukálódik a választható lehetőségek száma.
Gémerek számára jó kis levezető játék.

The decision space is just right, neither too big nor too small. There are multiple paths to victory if everyone is playing right. The dice can hose you from time to time. Try not to let it ruin your good time. The game is just the right length, comes in under an hour which is great. Fun.

UPDATE: I don't know. It's gotten to where, once everyone at the table knows the game well, it comes down to dice rolls. That's not interesting to me. Rating falling fast.

Yspahan is a great little game from Ystari, with multiple paths to victory, constrained but meaningful choices, a 50-70 minute playing time and camels.  It also lets you roll lots of dice, over and over again, without overly randomizing the game.  My preference for board games leans heavily to Euros, but the handfuls of dice are my favorite part!

RATING: 8
À la première partie, j'étais dubitatif. Plein de dés, des petits cubes en bois colorés qu'on pose un peu partout sur un décor pastel fort peu à mon gout. Et puis je perds de quelques points. Bref, une approche moyenne pour un jeu à première vue sans prétention.

Trois semaines plus tard, nouvelle partie… Tiens, ça a l'air pas mal cette caravane… Mais pour la rentabiliser, il faut quelques cubes par ci, un batiment construit par là… Et on est incroyablement pressé par le temps qui court à une vitesse folle. Tant que la partie s'est terminée sans avoir vu le temps passer.

Après une dizaine de parties, je n'ai plus que les couleurs à critiquer : le jeu est admirablement fluide, foncièrement original dans l'utilisation des dés et la dualité ville/caravane, parfaitement équilibré notamment dans le dosage du hasard à la Colovini, et je pourrais continuer à aligner les  superlatifs. Un TT d'or mérité, et un SdJ ou un DSP serait tout le mal qu'on pourrait souhaiter à Yspahan.

Il semblerait cependant que la dimension stratégique d'Yspahan ait souffert d'un grand nombre de parties, notamment sur Internet, et une stratégie « gagnante » semble aujourd'hui toute tracée : viser cartes et chameaux en première semaine pour construire rapidement le Caravansérail, se positionner au centre dès le début de la deuxième semaine pour pouvoir envoyer un grand nombre de chameaux à la caravane.

Dès lors, tout le jeu se situe dans la réaction au jeu adverse (remplir la caravane avant la fin de la deuxième semaine, jouer le Marchand au moment opportun…), profiter des opportunités (gros tirages sur le quartier des vases ou du coffre) pour faire la différence, notamment également dans la construction des bâtiments.

C'est déjà pas mal, mais c'est un peu dommage.

I like the way they've used dice here, but that's not enough to save this from a "meh" reaction. Better than Caylus and Mykerinos...but that bar is set pretty low. I don't like the cards, and I think the Caravanseri building is very overpowered. Also, this is one expensive game.

Plenty of meat and decisions to be made while having a simple rule set and a play time of about an hour or under.  I like it when you can get a lot of filling into a small package, and this game definitely gets it right for the amount of meat in the short play time.

Excellent to see a game rely so heavily upon dice yet this doesn't make the whole thing a big luck-fest (although luck defintely plays a part) - just a clever mechanic which greatly influences the players' tactical play and adds to the variation and, generally, the fun.

And who on earth wouldn't want more games with Camels in them?

I liked Yspahan pretty well. I put it in about the same category as Mykerinos, which is a game I like a lot. It went quick, and there are lots of ways to go about getting points. I thought I wasn't doing so well, but ended up winning in the end. That always helps me like a game after the first play :)

This game features a [i]very[/i] interesting use of dice, and has some unique mechanisms. It's just a bit weird as I felt like going for set long-term goals is compromised for the sake of just grabbing as many as points as you can all the time, and just trying to do the most stuff by the end of the game, period. Feels very tactical and restricted by the dice in that regard.

Another great majorities game from Ystari in the vein of Ys and Mykerinos ... except this one is even better.  Has the same tight, well-thought-out feel as a Knizia engine.  Quite dry and analytical despite the presence of dice !  Still, for all that, very fun and engaging.  The dice mechanism is unique, to my knowledge, and I thought it worked great.  There is not a single misstep in this whole game.  Two-player rules are also available on-line.  What more could you ask for?

RATING: 7.8
Yspahan -- Played four-player.  

Poor luck is mainly balanced by the various choices, but one player's [i]good[/i] luck can sometimes be hard for the other players to overcome.  If that player benfits more than once, you're looking at a runaway leader.  Players must remain aware of this and be willing to sacrifice some opportunities to keep this in check.  

I generally avoid conflict, but I find that Yspahan does not provide enough opportunity for players to reduce one anothers' scores.  For example, a dice-roll may result in several of one number and very few of the others.  The first player to choose will greatly benefit, so the others need to be willing to use their actions to counterbalance that benefit -- Sadly, moving the supervisor [b]may[/b] subtract some points (if the first player has no camels [i][b]and[/b][/i] no chance to later replace the token), but it returns no less than 3 points to that player, and potentially more points if the caravan later lengthens.  A token placed in the caravan's first row in the first week will score by game end no less than 5 points (2 for placement, 1 for each of 3 weeks), but if that player gets any tokens in higher rows, the first token will be worth even more.  A shrewd player will keep camels handy, so the supervisor poses no real threat to him.  This means players can't afford to wait to see if good luck will strike the same player twice.  Players must aggressively take advantage of any opportunities to reduce his bounty.  

I found this game quite fun, but I find myself hoping for an expansion or variant which will counteract the impact of good luck.

RATING: 1
After a year of so of my first play - I soloed it. It's not that bad, but I had justified reasons to hate it. And I'm sure I've seen some rules the first time (ahem). 

- It's a MPS not unlike worker placements (I'll argue it is one, only you're taking dice instead of placing - in any case it's another take on action selection). 
- Like many MPS games it's got preprogrammed paths to victory and like many MPS games of its era there's no synergy between them, no theme that would function as user interface - the way one is supposed to actually use all these arbitrary VP distribution tables is opaque and clunky .  
- Another thing I dislike (hate?) is demand to build an engine, but giving you very little actions in which to do so (yay optimisation!). You really must know the game well to know how to jungle this idiocy, I say idiocy because learning this is neither fun nor stimulating.
- Art. I seriously dislike old ystari art. First there's no theme worth naming such, then the art is kinda static and ...dead. Drenched in pastels to not be as obvious. 

What suprises me that people rate this higher than Knizia's Marco Polo - okay so that one is just set collection/hand management/Knizia's game of chicken type of game, yet theme makes much more sense. And has camels! This is just a light version of VP spread sheet matrix for those who want to calculate these sort of games - and has dice for randomness, woo hoo. 

EDIT - the main reason this has fallen to 1.0 is a really depressing visual style. And pretty dull and boring gameplay. 

[hr]
ADDENDUM (years later)

Oh dear. I had to read my comment after playing it for the last time as I really suppressed the memory of it existing. (It's a 1.0) I have no idea what's with the Ystari line, especially the older games. I can't imagine how uglier could they be. You might think I hate brown, well, yeah, except for chocolate and clothing (I do wear brown), but in clothing I seriously loathe speckled gray, the stalest colour one could possibly wear. Ystari line pretty much looks like pastelish and brownish and speckled had a child, the child always came in the graphic design style at least 10 years older than the game in question.
As for the game itself, my notes say it's an action selection full of arbitrary parts you must optimise around its VP spread sheet martric and it has no theme nor rhyme nor reason, ergo it's dull as hell. My notes don't actually say the last thing, but it's hinted in the sarcasm.

After 4 (4 players) games I consider this still a preliminary rating. Each time different strategies were doing differently well. I do not know whether it's caused by a good balance or luck. Sometimes I have the feeling the game is driving me instead I was really following some strategy (of course, the last week you usually have only single strategy as the optimal one).Definitely need to play more. After some more plays the rating decreased (from 7 to 6). It gets a very repetitive feel and I think luck plays a big role.

I've only played this game against the solidly implemented AI, and I often struggle against it. In this game, players roll a whole lot of dice and group them to certain actions according to the number of pips. Then players take turns choosing which action to take.

Luck plays an important role here as it often comes down to the luck of the draw. Getting camels, especially early in the game, seems to be a huge advantage. Fun, but occassionally frustrating when rolls don't go your way more than once.

A few people I know dislike this game due to their concerns over the randomness of dice. The more I play this game, the more apparent it becomes that the dice provide a decent challenge to your progress and decision making. Players who always choose which ever section has the most dice won't necessarily win. The key to winning is made up of good decisions and timing. Obtaining cards is a strong advantage and the caravan is a focal point for extra score. I encourage people to play this game at least three times before dismissing it for the dice mechanic.

RATING: 7.75
A fast playing area control game where players choose  their action for each turn based on a roll of the dice ( that determines which actions are available...and how strong each will be). Multiple ways to earn points- during each week in the shops, or over the course of the  game with the caravan. A hidden gem that's been overlooked by far too many people.

Yspahan strikes me as merely a so-so sort of game. It's clever. It plays fast. But it isn't compelling. The mechanisms don't really mesh naturally with the theme. And it's just too gamey for its own good - without yielding commensurate depth or satisfying play. My overall feeling is "meh".

A szabályát elolvasva rögtön megtetszett. Sok kocka általában elrettent egy játéktól, nem így az Yspahan esetében. A leírást elolvasva rögtön érezhető, hogy itt a kockák éppen hogy érdekesebbé teszik a játékot, mintsem a szerencse szerepét magasra emelnék. Sok helyen olvastam, hogy a BGG-n túl van értékelve ez a játék. Most az első kipróbálása után kijelenthetem, hogy ez egyáltalán nincs így és örülök, hogy a gyűjteményem között tudhatom ezt a könnyed játékot.
A szabályismertetés 10 perc és maga a játék tényleg a dobozon feltüntetett 45-60 perc közé esik. Gyors, érdekes, változatos, mégis némi gondolkodást igénylő kikapcsolódást nyújt. Éppúgy megtalálható benne a jó stratégia kialakítása, mint a taktika. Ajánlható bátran családi játéknak is, de a keményebb játékosok is megtalálhatják benne a számításaikat.

RATING: 9
Wheee!  There is something about this game that is just all out fun.  I think it is because you are rolling a ton of dice, but you are never short on great options.  The game chops along nicely, in fact so quickly that half the time you feel you are up against the wall trying to get everything done that you'd like.  

There is a really wonderful balance to the game.  The Caravan strategy (yes, I've won going heavy in the cavavan), and the building strategy both are viable.  I like how the cards aren't too powerful, but are worth just enough to increase your desire to get them.  There is a lot of game packed into such a short length.

UPDATE: Finally played it with four and for me it drops down to something like a 7.5.  Still a very good game, but your choices are much more determined by what is rolled as the better rolls will be taken by the time it comes around to you, and you have less opportunites to be the starting roller.

RATING: 7
The way the dice work is very interesting.  I'm a bit worried that there isn't really all that much strategy to the game; it seems like it's either camels or neighborhoods.  I do like it, just not as much as other, similar games.

I liked this game alot more than I thought I would. And how the designer managed to get dice into a Eurogame but maintain strategy is beyond me. After my first game I felt it was a bit too short having finished in an hour with so much still to do. But on a subsequent play I found this to be an error in judgement. Very accessible and fun to boot, this is a winner in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like the multiple ways of scoring, the fast pace of the game, and the fact that you have enough time to really fire all your guns, in terms of scoring. The seven turns between scoring rounds really gives you an opportunity to set yourself up on multiple fronts, while the random die rolls dictate what actions are available. There are precious few die rolls that result in no workable option, and taking a card is not really a bad thing.

I'm getting a little tired of the design paradigm that says that you must be starving at the banquet of possible actions. Hell, let my opponent and I take the actions that we want to take, and let's see who did better! It's the first Euro that I've been really excited about for awhile.

RATING: 6
I love the way the dice are used in this game. Throughout the entire game interesting decisions have to be made. A lot of viable strategies make up for interesting play. On top of that, I really like the artwork and playing time.
My only real concerns are that the caravan part of the game feels truly pasted on and the overseer -who we deemed would be the source of a lot of nasty interaction- just doesn't work that way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quality fast-moving game, and I can see this being a great two-player with my wife.  She'd really enjoy the dice rolling, and there's not too much interplayer conflict.  There is some nice goal chasing to be done in here in completing buildings and filling in quadrants of the city.

UPDATE: I like it, and it's fast and good, but it's hard to say that it's super amazing. Certainly has a nice set of decisions in a short amount of time, but it's started to get a little stale for me.

I was sure I'd hate Yspahan. It looked like just another dice-pushing euro with too many rules, icons, and a pasted-on theme. And it's many of those things! But the dice mechanism is clever, and everything works together so smoothly; the rules and icons just make sense. It feels like a Knizia, much like Pauchon's other camel-ridden game, Jaipur. I have to wonder, though, about replay value; I don't think there's a lot.

RATING: 6
OK, so so.

Pros - no text, just dice, color packages, gold and camels.

Cons:
Not enough strategy - the buildings provide some strategic interest as they provide some boost to the game, however not enough - and also everyone are building the same 6 buildings, so not very interesting.

The whole game is only about getting points, not very interesting apart from the point-driven strategy.

The caravan was not used on our game. In any case this is another competing track for getting points, which does not look very interesting (unless everyone are competing to get to 3 rows).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the first "hey this is a cool new way to use dice" dice games! I really liked it, but cooled on the game a bit after a while when the caravan strategy -- send your cubes to the caravan whenever possible -- seemed overwhelmingly strong.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
At the start of each round, the starting player rolls a bunch of dice (possibly with extra dice available only to the first player, at a cost). These d6 are allocated to action spaces according to their die face. Each space allows you to either place markers in different regions of the board, earn currency (gold or camels), get a special card, or move markers to the caravan (for VP scoring later). You can also buy a building on your player board, which improves the other actions for you in some way. The cards can be played for various bonus effects, too.

At the end of 7 rounds (days), score (and clear) each board area; also score the caravan (more markers = more VP), which is NOT cleared until it is actually completely filled. At the end of 21 rounds (3 weeks), the player with the most points wins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best new games I have played in a while.  The use of the dice for selecting actions produces just the right amount of randomness to keep the game from becoming too dry.  It's easy to learn, plays quickly, and presents some tantalizing options on each turn.  Update:  can't get enough of it!  Contemplating giving out my first ten in a while.

Eurogame puro pero con dados, ofreciendo un uso inteligente de los mismos. No sé si es por el arte gráfico, por la mecánica de la torre de dados o por todo el conjunto en sí, pero es un juego que me encanta sacar a mesa, y eso que los cubitos de madera no es lo mío, pero cuando un juego es bueno, me da igual la etiqueta.

The dice give this game a high replay value.  Nice time length, good choices, nice game all around.  There has been some talk about one building being too valuable - I haven't found that yet.

This may be the game with the least convinving theme of all games by Ystari, but that doesn't decrease the fun for me. Gameplay is smooth, simple and fast and throwing lots of dice is always fun. Choices are usually interesting without being too testing. With a better implemented theme, it might have been a great family game. But that's about the only real strike against it.

Easy, fast game for 3 or 4 players. Very good for introducing non-gamers. There are diverse means for scoring points, any of which may be viable in a given situation. I doubt that there is a single 'best' plan for all circumstances. The luck factor can be substantial, but trying to deal with it is entertaining.

Only played the online/PC version because my kids aren't interested in it. Okay for a fresh diversion from our usual fare. Nice use of dice. Plenty to do and not enough time to do it in. But boring (non-existent) theme really drags this one down for me. Will not be adding to my collection.

RATING: 7
I enjoy this game but I'm somewhat skeptical about the combination of luck and resource exclusivity: it's good that blocking is possible and that players are forced to pursue different strategies, but the engine-building aspects make early-game advantages compound.

That said, in practice it probably doesn't matter because wild point swings are possible based on exceptionally lucky rolls even late in the game. I'm not sure that's an argument in favour.

It's a nice bit of light/medium-light fluff, unsuitable for the highly competitive but a pleasant time for the rest of us.

What a great little game. We played twice last night and I won them both, could be why I;m so geeked about it. I really like the turn anguish, the mini maxing, all of it. Great mechanics all around and it doesn't wear out it's welcome. The more we play it, the more it becomes clear that the caravan is the only strategy. Of the games we have played the winner has always been the first player, and they have also been in the caravan. It's starting to wear rather thin, rather quickly. 

Really want to try this with new deck of cards.

The dice mechanic is innovative and interesting - but I dont think it works too well. It's hard to plan anything in Yspahan since the dice almost never do what you want them to do. It's very important to have good rolls when it's your turn to pick the first set of dice. When all your rolls suck, you're not going to win.

RATING: 7
Dice rolling Euro with multiple ways to score victory points. Each turn nine dice are rolled and these are placed depending on the number they show. Once the dice have been placed they can be used to perform actions whether it be acquiring camels or gold, placing goods in the shops within souks, or transferring goods to the caravan. Points are obtained by having goods in all the shops of a certain souk, having built a certain number of buildings (which in turn provide added bonuses) or having a certain number of goods in the caravan. There are quite a few options available each turn and the most obvious one isn't always the best, plus games tend to be quite tight with it being difficult for a runaway leader to emerge. Overall 'Yspahan' is a good well-balanced game but is probably slightly too dependent on the luck of the dice rolls to determine a winner preventing it from entering the upper echelons of this type of game.

RATING: 8
Played 1+ times.  There appears to be multiple paths to victory and the action selection mechanic with the dice is quite refreshing and neat.  The game can definitely be affected by good and poor roles, but I think it's robust enough to reward skillful play most of the time. 2008/10/08

Recent purchase - have yet to play, but really looking forward to it. Beautiful board, innovative use of dice.

update: several plays now - really wanted to like this one more, but is starting to fall a little flat for us with 2p. Use of cards, and supervisor (unless uncontested) don't seem like viable strategies without more folks, therefore can feel very repetitive.

I've found it uncanny how consistently nongamers really like this game.  There actually are a lot of other games that I personally would rather play than this (perhaps what I mean is that it is not as replayable as some) but it's such a pleaser that I get it out pretty regularly.  It feels like you can get a lot of gaming into an hour, too, if there are no newbies at the table.  It's a dicefest that almost always comes out excitingly close as long as players make sure not to let one person dominate the crossroads.

Very interesting use of dice. You have some choices (more cubes in the city, or try to make points at the caravan, what buildings build first) and you can pay for more dice (minimize the risk of a bad roll).

The`re some interaction - sending players cubes from the city to the caravan, but this can give that player many points at the caravan.

Some nice mechanics, but the city/caravan play decisions seem muddy. The wandering whatsit seems not especially consequential. Maybe I just need to play this more, but I don't feel much motivation to do so.

Nice game, very smart the "dice tower" mechanic.
One major problem: special cards are either too strong or almost useless... so the luck factor, that in dice rolling is almost unexistent, is too heavy in card drawing.

RATING: 7
Good game with interesting use of dice. Nice pastel artwork and wooden camels. Plays quickly. This is a light game.

Update: I have to lower my rating from 9 to 7 after playing this a lot on computer. Seems the best way to win is to pick up lots of camels and be lucky enough to get a camel card from the deck. That's how I feel at least.

RATING: 6
This game plays the player as much as the player plays it.  It's an interesting idea, but it's very easy to get screwed irreparably just by poor rolls on your turn.  For example, someone who rolls a bunch of camels first turn is set.  If you roll 1 camel on your first turn, you're pretty much hosed unless you get lucky and draw a card that either gives you some camels or allows you to buy the camel building with no camels.  All in all, not near as fun as St. Petersburg.

RATING: 8.75
08 JUN 2009 - Just realized today I originally had rated this as a 6.75. I have since played 2 more times and am really starting to get the strategies and the game. I like it significantly better and am now rating it an 8.75. There are so many options and never enough time to do them all. I have only played 2-player and would love to try it with more.

RATING: 6.5
I feel like this game is not a particularly good "use-dice-in-an-interesting-way" game (like Macao, Kingsburg, etc), not a particularly good area control game, not a particularly good build-buildings game, but overall it's not a bad game.  I'm just not sure I'd ever choose it over something else.

L'utilisation des dés est intéressantes, mais les choix sont plutôt évidents. Le jeu ne se renouvelle pas suffisamment (sauf pour les jets de dés). Heureusement, il est de courte durée.

RATING: 6
This game is really ahead of its time, and I am also not at all surprised to see that it was released right around the time Caylus came out. The point conversion and cube placement mechanics will seem vaguely familiar to a worker placement fan even if they are only tangentially related.

Using dice for resources is interesting because you never quite know what you will get. You can make plans, but the roll of the dice can force you to alter those plans. While this makes the game more tactical, there is still room for long term planning. I also enjoy how all of the players must make a choice based on the same dice roll. This adds an extra layer of maneuvering because you have to worry not just about your own plans, but also those of the competition.

There are definitely a handful of set strategies in the game. Some people may enjoy this aspect of the game. I find it somewhat limiting, but I would have to play the game more to know whether these strategies are flexible or rigid. I should also point out that this is not an uncommon criticism of mine for a variety of games, not just Yspahan. Finally, the strength of the buildings seems obvious much in the same way that getting more dice in Roll Through the Ages or Alien Frontiers is very powerful. Again, I need more plays to know for sure.

Overall, this is a good game with lots to think about on each turn. I look forward to repeat plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is an interesting game that has a few things in common with Caylus, and yet is pretty different.  The big dice rolls at the beginning of each turn can really vary.  You want a lot of a kind, or you kind of blow the first turn advantage.  There are a number of ways to score points, and balancing everything makes for a fun game.

I've got two games of Yspahan now and the second with four players was considerably better than the first with only three. Still what bothers me the most about this games is the occasional lack of options: yes, you can take cards if there's nothing for you on the dices but despite that cards can't really give you the needed influence in the city regions, except for one cube here or there. Being the last player of a round is more often than not a bad place to be. Yspahan is not a bad game but when compared to the game we played before it (El Grande), it's weaknesses are clear.

RATING: 10
I'm very impressed ... to the point where I'm wondering if Yspahan might be inching toward the very select few games I rate a 10. This now has proven to have held up to repeated play and hasn't lost it's appeal one bit. Does have a healthy dollop of luck, as the use of dice would imply, but there's plenty of room for strategy and the luck factor is very much mitigated by the extremely quick play time. This one packs a lot of punch for a game that can be played in 20 minutes by an experienced group. So ... in my book Ystari Games continue to roll! Update: Yspahan still hits a sweet spot and hits the table often three years after being published. Upgraged to the elite ranks of the very few games rated a "10" in my collection. Note: I still rate Yspahan a 10, but only as a three-player game, where it really shines. With four players, balance issues emerge and the fourth player is, in my experience, at a pretty big disadvantage.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This dice game for 2-4 players certainly has its share of luck, but the game is very fun and plays quickly. Because there are lots of ways to score points, there are some tough decisions to make every once in a while. Excellent game for newbies. Scales well from 2 to 4, playing differently depending on the number. 3 is the ideal number though since the 4th player gets poor choices 2/3 of the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The brilliant (one-of-a-kind) use of dice makes me want to like Yspahan more than I really do.  The game is overbroad; cluttered up with the game-breaking Caravan, the marginal player buildings, and an uneven card deck.  There is a truly elegant game in here. Recommendation:  dial-back the row multiplier on the Caravan before your first play.

Yspahan has medium-light gameplay with constant choices, a small random element to keep things interesting, and offers multiple paths to victory. These elements seem as if they would make the game a perfect match for me, but for some reason that game never really grabbed me. I think the problem was that despite the fact that I was constantly asked to make decisions, I never felt any tension. 

I'd play Yspahan again, but don't think I'll ever bring it out on my own.

Not a bad little game that can be played in 45 minutes. There are multiple paths to victory - fill the souks, fill the caravan, build the buildings  - which makes it feel a bit like Caylus-lite. The use of dice to determine the actions available for selection is quite innovative. I haven't really focused on the caravan strategy in my games to date. If this turns out to break the game, I'll probably decrease the rating.

10 plays: Have only managed the caravan strategy once, winning the game. Not enough experience yet to determine if it is a game breaker. Stays at 7.

RATING: 7.5
Rating could move up or down here.  I have had a lot of fun with this on my first four plays.  I love dice and I love games that use dice in interesting ways.  

The real beauty of this is that, once players have some experience, it plays quite quickly.  It truly belongs in the category of super-filler; plays in under 45 minutes but has some real depth.  Other games like this are Hansa and Mykerinos.  Yes the players have to have played a few times, but they don't have to be veterans. 

My wife and I can play Notre Dame in about a half-hour, but this is a function of just being two players and our having played over 20 times, so I don't categorize it as a true super-filler. 




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

This game has given me hope that dice are not completely dead.  I was worried that using dice as the main mechanic would hamper this game greatly, but truly this game shines with them.  Many choices to make, I really cannot wait to play this again!

Update: The above comment was made way back in 2007, when dice in euro's were still a faux pas.  In retrospect, I think Yspahan deserves quite a bit of credit for at least proving dice can work as a vehicle for worker-placement/action selection.

The game flows well and forces some tough choices on the players. It's fair on interaction, and ends exactly when it should.

Overall, a light decent experience.

Very nice way to incorporate a big handful of dice (which is always fun to roll).  The funny thing about this game is that, despite liking some of the mechanics, I don't miss it now that I haven't played it in a while.  So my new assesment is a bit more neutral than positive because in the long run it just doesn't stand out from the crowd.  Update -- maybe playing a computer version can ruin any game, but I now have no real desire to play anymore.  There are really only two strategies, one of which (caravan) is best when sitting in a specific seat (4th position in a 4-player game).  Victory then is a question of who gets the right rolls at the right time.  While rolls may tend ot even out over the course of the game, you can be hurt more by bad rolls early -- failing to roll at least a couple of camels (or drawing an equivalent card) in your first couple of turns with the die leaves you way behind with little chance to catch up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a delightful game.  The game forces you to stay flexible, because the choice you may need, may not be available.  Quick playing time, meaningful decisions.  One play, but I can see many more coming.  Its a light quick game, but I really think I will be able to dig my teeth into this.

OK I'd rather be playing Ys than Yspahan but that's unfair as they are completely different games. I like this a lot and enjoy the dice element.  Can be frustrating YES but isn't that also the ear mark of a good game? It is for me.

UPDATE: Still loving this game a year and half later. Teaching this one to new players and even people who are new to gaming as a whole is easy and fun. 

UPDATE: How long have I had this game? Oh yeah since it's release and still pulling it out often. For both new and seasoned gamers. For both those who have and haven't played it before. It's ALWAYS welcomed. Do yourself a favor.

Yspahan has lovely components in vibrant colors. The game is a clever mechanisms of choices. There are 12 dice in this game and almost no luck. Cudos to the designers for such a refreshing mechanism. The game is all about choices and in a classic Ystari tradition the scoring mechanisms allow for a variety of different strategies. It plays fast, we play with 4 "weeks" sometimes (28 turns) instead of 3 "weeks" (21 turns). No idea why the game should stop at 3 weeks (it feels short, where 4 weeks feel just right). The only thing that the game lacks is more conflict between players. Somehow there are not many ways to "punish" your opponents. Hint: You need to build buildings as soon as possible and stick to a strategy. Get the new cards from the Ystari treasure box, they add so much to the game!

Surprisingly fast-moving for the type of game it is. There aren't quite as many routes to victory as in something like Puerto Rico, but that's not what it's about. There's still a lot of balance in the caravan, the buildings, the resource collection,... it works out pretty well. One memorable play of this had my friend take cards and resources almost exclusively, then on the last turns just dump them all for points (with the 2 per camel and 1 per gold cards) and winning.

RATING: 8
finally played my first in person game. some things are better on the computer...tracking start player, manipulating dice, moving turn markers, scoring...it is nice that the computer takes care of this. But despite this I really did get a better sense of the game in person, and enjoyed it more that way. Also, since kind of the whole point is manipulating the dice, the in person game has that tactile thing going on.

Overall impression is that it is a game that moves quickly, is fun with the dice rolls, and just deep enough. i could play this one with anyone, from my game group, my family, my students, or as a gateway game. strangely enough, it gives the same vibe to me as the other camel game, Through the Desert, in the quickness meets depth and playable by anyone categories.

I really want the Mike Doyle cover version.

Quick to play, if I remember right each game lasts 21 turns which may sound like a lot but it goes pretty quick.  Check out Board Games with Scott's video on this one, he does a great job of laying out the game and the rules to make it easier to learn.  (Actually that statement applies to all of his videos that I've seen.)  A lot a strategy packed into a quick game.  Yes there are dice, but that just makes you adapt your strategy... they don't really make or break your game.

Good game for three players. Do not know how it plays with two or four yet. The quick setup, lack of in-game text and short gamelength make it easy to get to the table. The dice ensure that each game plays out differently, ensuring replayability. It is just a pity that the board and components are a bit on the small side (at least in the German version). Nevertheless: A nice little game (but nothing special).

Game has a unique twist with the dice roll. I find the dice gives the game an additional luck factor which upon multiple plays on the computer, becomes annoying. clearly, it is more favorable to roll similar numbers during your turn, even though it may not exactly be the thing you are looking for. I like the game, but not quite sure how much I enjoy the luck aspect of the game.On subsequent plays, I think the dice rolls is just way too unpredictable and also influences the outcome way too much. I love luck in games, but I do not like luck taking over the entire game. This game makes "choices" rather limited.

072811 Replaying this game after several years have reconfirmed my fears that the luck of the roll is quite heavy. In a four player game, each person gets to roll 5 times, perhaps 6 if you come in last during the final round. Getting to choose camels and money is critical during your roll because if the camel and gold options are even remotely enticing during other players turn, they will be gone by the time they reach you. So, if you roll poorly and the dice are evenly distributed during your turn, it is hard to play catch up. Having opted for a more focused caravan strategy, I am not sure it alone is sufficient for victory. Perhaps one must start really early, in the first round. But, unlike other games where the strategy is to go for actions that no one else is taking, the caravan strategy is valuable only if others are willing to at least chip in to increase the multiplier. Overall a decent game, but too much luck. The luck aspect of the dice rolls are too hard to overcome given the low amount of dice rolls per player.

RATING: 7
An OK game. Didn't blow my mind but was fun to play. 

After one game, it seemed to me that you should alway build all your buildings - there are always 2-3 building that really help your strategy and as the rest of the buildings give you 20-15 vp:s so you should build them anyway... if this is true, it is quite boring. I would perhaps change the scoring for the buildings linear: 5vp/5vp/5vp/5vp/5vp instead of 0vp/0vp/5vp/5vp/10vp

This was one of my favorites from BGG.con, although I missed out on some notable possible contenders.  I got a little worried when I saw the hugs pile-o-dice, but once it was explained how they work, I relaxed.  Sure, there is a big random element to the game, but I think it works very well.  

The die are allocated to action slots on a side board.  Every die of the lowest number goes in the bottom slot (Camels) and the highest valued die on the top (Gold).  Each remaining set of numbers goes on slots for the four neighborhoods, filling the bottom first.  The actions are simple.  Take camels in the lowest slot, allocate people (cubes) to stores in the neighborhoods, or take gold in the highest slot.  Once you take your action, the next player chooses from what's left and so-on.  Since you can only take an action where there are die available, the most valuable neighborhood is frequently unavailable.

There are some additional actions that are always available.  One is to move the overseer by a number of spaces on the die you choose (this is the only time that the value of the die affects your actions).  If there is a cube in a store next to the space he lands on, that cube is sent to the caravan.  This can be a bad thing for a player because it might break up a complete set of stores (only complete sets score), or it can be a good thing because you get score in the caravan as well, and if you have a cube in an incomplete neighborhood, you might as well send him to the caravan.

The other special action is to take a card.  These cards can be played at any time and they typically get you goods, extra placements, or let you build things for less.

Speaking of building, the last major aspect of the game is the building board.  There are 6 buildings on the board and each one gives you a nice advantage.  When these buildings are active, you can some very nice bonuses.  I cleaned up in my first game by building more than anyone else.  I definitely didn't get away with that twice!

One of my favorite things about the game is the pace.  Like Mykerinos, which I also really like, it maintains a brisk, but tense pace through-out.  I always love a game that takes 45 minutes and leaves you feeling like it wasn't just a time-killer.

This is probably better with 3 players. With 4, every time you pick last you have to get pretty lucky to have any worthwhile options at all. Mostly you will just take a card. There is a lot of luck in the dice and cards, but it's pretty manageable. Overall, this feels like a pretty standard mid-weight euro, but is quick to explain and very quick to play, which is great. I'm not sure this will hold long-term interest however.

Yspahn has a dice selection mechanic that is a lot of fun. It plays very quickly and has a good dose of strategy. Sometimes choices are a bit obvious, and the dice can drive the choices for you, but it's still fun to throw a load of dice.

I was really excited about this game when I first go it, and enjoyed my first 10 or 15 plays. However, I've come to believe that shipping to the caravan, when combined with the building which nets you a card when you ship and the space on the board that lets you ship two camels at a time, is simply overpowered. This has really ruined my enjoyment of the game.

Update: I've played some games with the expansion rules (I don't have the expansion, just played with the new rules modifications) and they really fix the game. I've given it a big rating bump.

It's a fun game with interesting mechanisms.  It seems there are too many interesting mechanisms.  You only have 21 turns to take advantage of them.  In our 3 player game noone ever moved the supervisor.  There so much to do and so little time that the end of the game left me a little empty. I'd play it again but probably not often.

I liked this game the first couple times I played it.  Since then, the caravan strategy has a tendency to dominate the game.  Pair placements on the caravan with the caravanserai building, which allows you to take a card every time you put a cube on the caravan, and you'll frequently coast to an easy victory.  Being able to score cubes on the caravan twice or more given the end of the week scoring is strong enough, but being able to take a card every time you put a guy on the caravan is ludicrously good.  The strategy can become stronger still if the caravan player also manages to get the buildings to move the supervisor more flexibly and the building to get more camels.  In order to be competitive with somebody running a caravan strategy, you basically have to run a caravan strategy yourself.  

This game has the potential to be a nice short-but-meaty affair, but I think that it would take some house-ruling, and I don't want to have to find house rules for a 45 minute game.  There's other games that fit into that niche that don't require balancing.

Rated after two three player games, one was years ago. The camels are nice, but at least with three players there seems to be pretty much everything more than enough. There are lots of camels and coins, so many special cards that you need to shuffle the deck all the time and everyone gets lots of points. Yeah, and the game took 2½ hours to complete (including the rules).

Not that much interacting with other players, enough room to play mainly one's own game. Little bit teasing is included, but not enough.

Maybe we played the game wrongly or found some strange strategy which gave lots of points to everyone or the game is broken. SDJ nominee gives a hint, that the last point is not true. Anyway, I don't feel interested in to try this game again to find out if there were something strange happening in the latest game.

After reading the rules third time, I discovered, that we indeed played the game quite wrongly, affecting the results, rating of the game and these comments.

Updated after the latest play, set the rating to 6. It felt better than I remembered, but might need more plays to find the full potential - or discover, that it is not so special.

1598. Yspahan the fair becomes the capital of the Persian empire. Thus, being placed at the center of the world, the city enjoys a period of cultural and economic blossoming. The cities and villages of the region intend to take advantage of this expansion. Caravans loaded with goods and jewels set out for the desert, bearing the promises of a radiant future...

The players embody merchants trading with Yspahan. Meaning to take advantage of the coming of the Shah’s supervisor, they score points by placing their merchandise in the right shops, by sending them to the caravan, and by constructing buildings.

RATING: 6
I like the dice-rolling mechanism in the game, and I like the different choices you have between ways you can score points.  We never moved the supervisor in our one playing of the game, because we never could see how it could be advantageous to do so, and after several games against the computer, I don't see that it's used that often.  It MAY fall apart if someone takes the power card route, but really, you can't take JUST the caravan route, or JUST the majorities route, or JUST the power cards route to win the game.  You really have to balance it all, and it's a novel use of dice to eliminate much of the luck.  I also wonder if the player who gets first pick early in the game has an advantage; in some games against the computer, having a great die roll on the first turn, when going first, can almost ensure that you will win.  Regardless, the short play time of this one will ensure a permanent spot in my collection.

Plays quickly. Lots of tense decisions. I love the way the dice are used. My wife and I had an initial poor 2-player game, and I couldn't convince her to try it again. I think her response was because she was in a bad mood, and the game moved slowly as we checked the rule book for various things. 2 days ago we played 4-player with a couple of experienced players. She liked it. Yesterday we played 2-player while it was fresh in our minds. She liked it. Today we played 2-player again. She liked it. I think we have a winner on our hands.

If you get into a hole out of the game, it's quite difficult to catch up.

The first time we played this as a three-player game, our whole group completely ignored the supervisor and caravan, and the game was very boring. We pulled it out again as a four-player game after reading about the strength of the supervisor and caravan, and two of us focused fairly exclusively on utilizing them.  The two of us that focused on the supervisor and caravan came in first and second place by a fairly wide margin.  That makes me wonder a bit about replayability, but we still had a fun time for this go-around.

RATING: 7
Update: It's a clever game, I still like it, but it's shallow.  I play pretty much on auto-pilot now, with no discernible difference in results.
----------
First games left a "that's it?" feeling; that passed and this has grown on me. It's got just enough under the hood, and yet zips along.  I do think more cards would be nice, and the 3-camel card is clearly too strong (with the "2 pts per camel" card bringing up the rear).  So perhaps a rough edge or two, but clever and fun. Reminds me of Roma in that way: so much to like, but not quite polished.  Also, my wife likes it a lot, which is a huge boost for any game under my roof.

I must say, though, $50 is WAY too much for this really rather small game.  Must be the dollar/euro thing....

Played the prototype (thanks Rick!) and like it a lot (maybe because I won the game).   The dice mechanic is "cute" - it never feels as if the luck is a big factor, probably because you're rolling a bucket full of dice so probabilities work out.  Probably made for fun math for the designer.  Lots of options,  but it moves really fast. 

Sad to see it only plays 3-4,  as that's a pretty small player spread,  but more downtime probably wouldn't work out.

Excellent resource management game which will change evey game cos of the combination of the dice rolled. Upgraded to a 9.

A quick snack that eats like a meal.  This very quick (45 min) game has all of the decision making of a much longer game.  I think it will be a favorite in my collection for years to come.  After a couple of plays, however, the one weakness has become apparent.  You can get a couple of really lucky (or unlucky) rolls in the first turn that can turn the game into an early blow out.  If you can get the  2 per souk scoring tile out before the end of the first week through an early roll of a bunch of camels, or the build without camels card, you can set yourself up for a lot of extra scoring by the end of the game.

RATING: 7.5
Let me begin by saying that the camel game pieces are ADORABLE. I have yet to develop a strategy for this game,  I play it very randomly and probably don't reap its full benefit as a result. But I enjoy it. It's one of the wide variety of games that has enough turn choices to engage the casual gamer, enough chance to give everyone a shot at winning, but also enough substance to be played seriously as well (as Yves so powerfully showed us). There wasn't anything that jumped out as unique or special (unlike Ginkopolis, the theme isn't stunningly original; unlike Las Vegas, the "fun" factor wasn't pleasantly high; etc.) but it is a solid game, probably appropriate for anyone. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Overall this is a neat little area control game.  My main knock on it is the randomness of the dice.  The idea of using the dice to control which regions you can build in is neat, what isn't neat is how camels one of the key items to advancing our position can be downright impossible to get sometimes (if the dice aren't cooperating).  Plus the camel trail mechanism seems like it would be a nice alternative to the core victory point mechanisms, but it seems difficult to really work that mechanism compared to the main one.

I do like this game. I certainly have enjoyed the games I've played. As far as production quality and illustration it rates very highly for me and I prefer this style than all the other games produced by ystari thus far. I *do* feel however, that the game does largely play itself a little with what is likely the best choice to take as far as actions each turn. There also appears to be really only two major strategies, caravan strat and souk building strategy..both mixed perhaps with a little building strat. Nevertheless, as a dice game I like it. And it probably now is my most favoured dice game (over that of bluff) to play that plays quickly. I'll be interested to see how it fares in a years time.

I find the randomness annoying instead of exciting, and it just isn't much fun for me to build up my position.

I picked this up in part because I already had the "Souks" expansion in the Ystari box. It's a great game, and quickly became one of my favourites.

The layout with 3 boards (plus one per player) is as unusual as the dice-based set-matching gameplay. And I love the little wooden camels! The different paths to victory provide a complexity that belies the speed it plays at.

Upgraded rating to 10 as of 12/09/12. Downgraded back to a 9 as of 01/08/13. After almost 20 plays I'm more aware of its limitations. Still a great game, though!

RATING: 5
Truthfully I have avoided Yspahan for a long time.  Even though the use of the dice is clever, I was still turned off by the reliance of them.  I'm happy to report that my disdain for the mechanic is somewhat unfounded, as there are plenty of decisions beyond the simple die rolling.  However, not all of those choices were created equal.  For example, the caravan becomes relatively useless if no one else gets in on the action.  Gold and camels are of lesser importance as the game progresses once you have constructed most of the buildings.  I was able to score more than half of my total points just by controlling the board in the last week.  I can see why some people have claimed to have figured this game out, and it would be a fatal flaw if Yspahan does not offer enough variety in strategy after successive plays.  Even so, for now, I'm fairly hopeful and would not mind playing again.

Update: So I finally got to witness firsthand how you can abuse the caravan track to win this game by a landslide.  The strategy is perfectly sound and legal, but it is just so completely broken.  Therefore, I reduced my rating for Yspahan and have decidedly put this game in the "will not likely to play again" category.  It is quite disappointing to find out that there exists one way of playing which trumps all others, kind of makes me wonder what's the point then?

Very happy with Yspahan right now, and I've only ever played it as a two player!  It works really well as such, it's fast, not a whole lot of downtime and some interesting tactical (and strategic) decisions.  The dice system is really, really clever.  I was on the fence about picking up Yspahan because it seemed to be too expensive of a game for what it was; I'm glad now I did.  Especially with how much I've played it already!

I didn't ever know how to play well at this game that is a very strange mix of tactical situation where to make the best choice possible and strategical plan to realize. Not easy to find the way to manage both things.

When I saw this game last Saturday at Spel 2011 in Broechem, Belgium I was hearing that sentence over and over again in my head. “All Ystari games are great….. All Ystari games are great…. All Ystari games…..”. The next thing on my mind was “Camels, this is the camel game!”.

Those two combined were the reason we bought this game. If we should have picked it from the look of the box, we won’t have bought it probably. This was the Master Print Edition. Don’t know what the difference is with a regular edition (except of the box art). We couldn’t wait to play this one, but we did it also. Two long days we waited. Watched a review yesterday, and started playing. The review we watched (in Dutch), was great. We didn’t have to read any rules (except the part for the 2 player changes), and just start playing.

To be honest, I expected more of this game. I think it’s because of the name Ystari on the box, I was expecting a more strategic game than that it is. Nevertheless, it’s fun. Maybe a bit too much luck involved  with all the dice. If you have bad luck, you throw a lot of the same numbers, and that way, there aren’t too many options too choose from. But as said, it’s fun, and we may play it regularly. This is a game I would recommend to other people.

I hate dice. Hate 'em.

So whenever I find a game that uses them really well my appreciation is proportionally high. I love Kingsburg and Yspahan for this reason.

I really like the distracting diversity of scoring mechanisms, and that the dice-driven market forces you to operate opportunistically, and yet sometimes requires you to choose what seems like a less-sweet deal, since there is a subtler option that helps you more in the long run.  Quite elegant!

Dice. There's a winning strategy. Noticeably a game that has rates downgraded. Original dice mechanic but still too random for my taste.

Currently my definition of perfect medium-weight eurogame.
Quick, cheap, nice looking, simple to understand while offering interesting decisions.
Excellent use of dice (from a dice hater).

After 10+ Plays: A great game for that 30-45min. time slot, that really feels like a full game, not just a filler.

This is the one we play the most. It is very good to use as an introduction to non-gamers. Also it plays in 45 minutes which is good.

Close to perfect game. Plays fast, is easy to explain and still uses a lot of different mechanisms. The use of dice in this one is excellent. Overall another hit (for the family as well as hard-core gamers) from Ystari.

Good game with a very clever mechanic to determine the actions availabel each round using multiple dice....the game suffers greatly from the broken (IMHO) caravan strategy

Nice game. Initially I was very enthousiast, but now it seems that a cretain strategy (cards-caravan) always leads to victory. So, game not in balance for those who know the way.

A bit middle-of-the-road when it comes to Eurogames, this game actually has quite a few things working against it: A boring, overused theme; only playable by 3 or 4 players; a lot of little rules to learn for a game that only lasts 30-40 minutes.

The experience itself is engaging, and some of the mechanics feel fresh, but there a plenty of parts that I'd do away with, or re-design. The dice allocation is neat, but the caravan is perfectly boring and its ideas have been seen before. The cards also needed a bit more spice. 

This is a game I enjoy playing, but it isn't hard to find something a bit more engaging these days.

A lot of fun and gameplay packed in a short time

Family game with a lot more depth than you might think at first sight.

This game is not my cup of tea.
Game mechanics are too game mechanics, in other words not reasonble with the thema and too complicated.

Los jugadores representan a comerciantes árabes que pueden ganar puntos de 3 maneras: 1.- Dominando la mayor cantidad de locales en las 4 zonas de la ciudad. 2.- Fortaleciendo su estructura de comercio (tablero personal). 3.- Enviando caravanas de bienes.

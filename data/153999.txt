RATING: 4
An interesting co-op in terms of managing the deck amount, reshuffle, and hand refill limitations. The general decision space of when to complete objectives vs letting your partner fill them is probably the most interesting aspect of it (the route building to do all of these things is sort of ancillary as long as players keep one of each color between them). When to stay balanced and refill your 6 cards has an interesting interaction with using your partner's cards completing the objective. Ultimately though, there are only a few edge cases that exist once players get up and running. To that end, there is an included set of difficulty variants (the arguments) that the designer has included.

Ultimately a churn game for us. it's a unique example of how to interact with other players. Plus, it has wonderful artwork.

1st play: Thematically this game is very cute.  The idea of moving through a relationship and all the emotions that go with it is fun.  Unfortunately the game isn't.  We played the first time through on the basic rules.  There was almost no interaction whatsoever.  Infact, the rules forbid game-related interaction, and I think I dozed off during the play.

2nd play: Thinking that maybe we had set the difficulty too low, we added in "arguments".  The game swung from "too easy" to "lost based on how the cards were shuffled".  We had an argument on our 2nd card, and there was no way to get past it.  Had we drawn different cards, we might have been able to snooze through the rest of it, but - mercifully - the game put us down quickly.

Kickstarted. It's a very pretty abstract movement coop game with a theme reminiscent of couples' therapy. You move around trying to keep your markers in balance, using a combination of cards while strategizing not to put yourself in an untenable position or run out of cards. Basic mode seems pretty easy, but the "arguments" do make it significantly harder.

To begin with, excellent presentation of the theme and the different emotions by Marie Cardouat. Secondly, the game conveys succesfully the feel of cooperation and bonding between the players through its actual mechanics. A player should always keep in mind his/her partner's needs, he uses his/her deck, so in terms of incorporating theme mechanics-wise we are at excellent level.

RATING: 7
The simplicity of the game and the board layout hints at the pace at which the game was made. It is, at its core, a very simple game but this is not its point. Its point is to make you think of your partner's position as much as your own.

Often, I've seen first plays of this end quickly when one player does too much on their turn almost just because they can and leaves their partner blocked and immobile, losing the game. This game doesn't reward you for pulling off sweet moves!

So there it is. A trivial game which plays more to instruct you to pay attention to your partner's piece as much as your own.

A fun, co-operative game of limited communication for two players. I picked it up because my group and I love Hanabi so much, and my missus and I hoped this would scratch a similar itch - and to some extent it does, despite being very different games mechanically. The game is a fun puzzle, and players aren't able to share the information they wish they could - hence scratching the same itch for us - and works MUCH better for two players than Hanabi. However, as the game uses a board, rather than just a deck of cards this one ends up becoming more of a puzzle to be solved than a game to be explored many times. After scoring 25 in Hanabi, there is the challenge of scoring 30, then ways to make the game incredibly difficult and my group and I have racked up over 90 plays of Hanabi. Whilst there is a more challenging mode for this game, after only 5 plays it does feel like we have "beaten" the game - and it has sat on the shelf unplayed since winning the game twice in a row...

A fun puzzle for two players that deserves a 7/10 rating, but not heaps of depth, exploration or replayability in my opinion.

Very unique game with an unusual theme. I played this with my actual partner and we were giggling at the silliness of it all. But the gameplay is intriguing, and the theme really comes out nicely. There will be moments you want to shout out to your partner, "No! Don't do that!" but you can't, so you have to trust them. If they fail, you have to be forgiving. What better lesson in relationships could there possibly be?

Based on 2 plays:

Our first game we lost really early due to an obvious n00b mistake, but our second game we won handily. This game feels possibly a little too easy to be truly interesting, but we'll have to play again with the Arguments and re-asses.

I want to be in this game's court re: "art", but I just don't feel like I actually get anything out of it in that regard. It's like I can see what it's doing and appreciate the attempt, but the emotional component of good art is absent for me. So all I can do is judge it as I do everything else (which is possibly unfair): on fun factor. 

And on that note, unless Arguments drastically improve the experience, I'll just say that I'd take Hanabi over this any day.

This game is a simple move and complete tasks with a partner. You can use each others cards and there is some strategy to achieve these goals but overall there isn't much to this game to make it memorable other then its name. The board art is boring and not being able to talk to each other makes it even more boring.

A very satisfying two player cooperative game with nice artwork. Pity you spend most of the game covering up the cards so you only see half the card at the time. Mechanics are very solid - you have to consider not just your own cards but also what your partner has, or else you might accidentally "kill" your partner. Highly recommended as a weeknight couple game.

This is an interesting puzzle, but unfortunately not one with lasting appeal.

The 'theme' (using that word loosely) of this game drew me in, with a couple working through a stormy relationship. Dealing with constantly varying emotional needs while staying balanced and considering the needs of your partner, all without saying a word, sounded vastly different than anything I'd ever heard of. 

I played a few times with my own partner to see what the game had to offer. The puzzle of the game was pretty challenging, especially when adding in the optional 'argument' cards. We lost often, but would try again immediately after. Back and forth we moved our little stones, battling against the currents of the emotional river we sailed down. All in silence.

Silence. We played every single game without a word to each other, as you're intended to. "...and then, we held hands" says you can talk about things other than the game, but we didn't bother at first. We would hyperfocus on our fictional emotional struggles trying to pierce each other's minds with our telepathic screaming: "Go sad>calm>angry>happy!". Eventually, the silence gave way to conversations about other things, but it felt odd to be talking about the banal while never being able to discuss the lovely puzzle we were solving together.

"...and then, we held hands" is a tense puzzle to solve with someone closely connected with you, but you can never discuss anything with your partner. And while that's sort of the whole point, we both felt that working on a puzzle together was more fun if you could be noisy about it.  

---

As a side note, I had to replace the beads that came with the game with some from a local craft store. The included beads were much too large for the board and nigh indistinguishable from each other.

One of my favorite two-player games to play with my wife. The gimmick/mechanic of not discussing the game as you play is surprisingly rewarding. I find it forces me to slow down, which is something I often need. Overall, a comfortable game with satisfying art and a quieting theme.

Why this is not a 10:
-> Simple and fun but not one to be played over and over again.
-> Winning a game can be quite difficult and losing too many in a row definitely puts a damper on things.

I backed this game thanks mostly in part to the unique theme behind the game. Granted, now that I've played it a few times I can easily see that the theme is very much pasted on. Even so, the game is still fun to play, especially if you take into consideration the thematic explanations for the mechanics.

The game is quite tough as well. As of this writing we've only won the game once. It is a great game for couples. I love the artwork and the glass player pieces are nice. I wish the board was higher quality as it seems kind of cheap and never sits flush on the table whenever we play it.

This is really interesting and you really have to look at what cards the other player has available and what position they are in on the board. 

We played a few games of this and it really is all about keeping yourself balanced to allow you to draw the cards you could need, rather than scrambling to complete the missions asap. 

We probably talked more about the game than was strictly allowed by the rules, but overall an enjoyable and interesting diversion for a wet Sunday afternoon.

This cooperative abstract movement puzzle aims for an emotionally poignant theme but sets its sights perhaps a little too high. 

For me, the theme fades rather quickly into the background in favor of solving the color-coded movement, except for two key aspects that did successfully carry the intent of the design: maintaining balance between the negative and positive colors/emotions, and always thinking of the partner's turn while playing your own. 

If that does it for you, great. 

Aside from these weakly evocative bits, much of the rest of the thematic terminology and rules feel contrived and ineffective. 

Since the available colors are totally open information, voluntarily "hiding" one side of the cards seems unnecessary aside from adding a memorization layer, and staying silent amounts to artificially "playing along" with the dysfunctional couples theme of aspiring to telepathic emotional synergy (a frankly immature idea about a healthy relationship). Neither of these aspects sit well with me, either in the sense of gameplay or in the truth of what they strive to represent.

So my plays have been enjoyable, but the overall experience hasn't been as engaging as the visual presentation and thematic premise had initially led me to believe. It reminds me of a similar trend in indie video games, where heady topics are shoehorned into a very simple design that wouldn't be evaluated as generously without the "deeply confessional" nature of the subject matter. Neither end of this representational equation are mutually reinforced in any considered or enlightening way. They just share space in the same game, lending happenstance significance through proximity and the player's idiosyncratic willingness to invest their own private narrative into it.

I predict a lot of overly affected confessional reviews that amount to mostly Rorschach blot test ramblings, gushing their way around the mostly uninteresting core gameplay.

Good abstract, on the first couple of plays, then quickly looses appeal. It's a bit interesting since it's a co-op without talking, which is a bit unusual. However, the game is mostly two player solitaire. It's often fairly obvious what your partner will do on their turn.
A best practices on how to play in ambiguous situations quickly evolved between me and my wife, and from then on the game had few meaningful decisions. Which cards you draw mostly determines the difficulty of the game.

RATING: 6
Only played once so far, with talking, as suggested by the rule. I am eager to try the full version. The rules weren't as clear as I would like them to be, but even putting the theme aside, I would still like this concept. Doing away with the usual co-op's problems by playing in game-related silence is daring. I like unconventional ideas.
Oh, and while the cards are pretty, I do find the emotion cards' illustrations distracting. Would prefer cleaner lines.

Update: After the second play, my interest has cooled a bit. It is still an interesting game, but there is not as much fun in it as I would like.

Update 2: After the third play, I feld that we were done with this. Off to the trade pile.

I think the idea of a cooperative two-player game where players aren't allowed to speak is very interesting, and I'm happy people are experimenting with unusual themes, and the art is really nice.  

It's a little weird to play as a gamer though, because it really feels like a therapy tool. (1 play)

Some people say this is an abstract with a pasted on theme that doesn't make sense.  IMO, the theme makes perfect sense if you've fucked up a relationship or two in your life.

This game does a great job of exploring how actions can be communication, and how easy it is to misinterpret them.

Cooperative two-player, abstract with a theme screwed on. The theme itself (varying emotions in an evolving relationship) is fine, how it's tacked on feels less convincing. 
First play (without the optional "arguments" rule) went smoothly and was too easy for us. I'm curious whether it will be challenging for us with the "arguments" rule.
I like the mechanical ideas, though.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2018)

I have wanted to play the game for a long while now, but ...and then, we held hands disappointed me. After reading the rules, I was expecting a much better game, but it fell flat for us. its design and execution is unique though.

At first I read the rules from a file I found here on BGG (as I usually do) but the rules were badly redacted, they explain the game without explaining the nodes and which is which, it makes the game harder to learn. Those rules are very unsatisfying (they have 2 pages) but then I opened the game and I found a different rulebook (8 pages long) and a much better one. Once I understood them I was able to explain them under 4 minutes, the game is very easy to learn. Playtime is under 30 minutes.

The theme is great and unique, it also makes the game a bit weird to play with your friends, so I played it with my SO. The game´s mechanisms don’t support the theme, to enjoy it, there has to be a lot of abstraction from the players. The game is mostly and abstract endeavor. 

The name of the game is very cool.
 
The art is ok, I was expecting much better due to the artist, but it works perfectly for the game. The graphic design works very well but, still, I was expecting better components. The folded board doesn’t stay flat on the table and it looks like a prototype (a minor issue for me though). 

Gameplay isn’t very fun and that’s the big issue. I thought it was going to be much more interesting, but it isn’t. The game can be hard to beat, but that’s due to the luck of the cards, not because it offers hard decisions, we were able to beat it in the second play. The card-splaying is a boring mechanism as you have to constantly reorganize the cards (another minor issue though).

I really like that you have to stay silent (about the game) while you play it, otherwise it would be much more easy to beat, but it is weird thematically that you cannot comment on your emotions, it seems counter-intuitive in a relationship game. 

Bottom line, ...and then, we held hands is a letdown for me. It is an unique game but it isn’t very fun nor interesting to play. Luck of the draw plays a huge role in the game, but the decisions needed to play it are rather easy. You do need to pay attention to your partner´s situation or you will lose suddenly. There is very low tension in the game. I will sell it ASAP. My SO didn’t like it very much.

I played ...and then we held hands with a friend and neither of us enjoyed the game at all. Probably the biggest annoyance we had with the game was that it is a board game and a game about relationships and yet you are not allowed to talk about the game during the game. This created an environment that was frustrating and yet a frustration that we were not allowed to talk about. Isn't a big part of building or fixing a relationship talking to the other person? At any rate, neither of us liked this game at all and we were very happy when the game finally ended.

RATING: 3
I jumped late on the KS for this one because of the different theme, some early positive reviews, the promise of a silent-communication co-op, and that the card art featured the work of Marie Cardouat, whose work I have long admired in Dixit. All of this made it seem like a pretty safe bet.

There are many reasons I do not listen to Rahdo, nor support his annual "Beg for Dollars" campaign on Kickstarter. He raved about this one, apparently, but I never watched it because the man takes 10 minutes to communicate 1 minute's worth of information. This was not a large $$ investment, but I feel sucker-punched.

The game is a card-driven abstract that is supposed to emulate the ups and downs of a relationship. The object is to silently play cards that are displayed in front of either player to move from "emotional" node to "emotional" node in order to meet in the middle of 4 concentric rings to reach "equilibrium" in the relationship.

What a bunch of faddle. The nodes are colors. The rings are lines. There is partnership, but without being able to communicate there is no joy. If either player runs out of cards you lose, but it is pretty easy to replenish when you need to. Without theme, without tension, without fun, one stares at the board and cards and the only emotion elicited is embarrassment that I actually fell for the marketing and inflicted this pile on a loved one.

I was really looking forward to owning this game because of its unique theme and simple play. Unfortunately, after 5 plays, it has too many negatives to earn the rating I had hoped it would deserve. After 2 plays I re-read the rules to ensure that I had played it correctly. I had. Again, after 4 plays (and 1 non-game that was over before it started) I checked the rules again, and again I had played correctly.
Since it is quick, I will probably play it more, so my rating may go up if it proves to be better than at this time. Here are the issues that are dogging its rating:
Although the rules are relatively simple, the game is quite fiddly to play.
The game is just too random. It is quite possible and it has happened in one of my plays (an uncounted 6th play) that the game is over on the turn of the first card.
There are almost no decisions in the game. Options are so limited that there really is only one way to play each turn.
This is a classic case of the game plays you.
Really disappointing.
We played a couple more games - still trying to like this game - but my opinion just got lower. At this point, I feel that this game is broken, not just bad.
Interestingly enough, I have others say that the game was too easy and they just breezed through. I could see that happening once at random, but not repeatedly, so I suspect that there is a general problem in understanding the rules - including for me.

I backed this via Kickstarter mainly because of the wonderful theme. Though I don't personally identify with the emotional nature of the theme, it is original enough that I want to support it. This is basically an abstract, but the combination of delightful artwork and unconventional theme elevate this to something I wouldn't mind playing every once in a while. But mechanically it isn't convincing enough to merit deep investigation.

The theme had always kind of turned me away from the game as well as the fact that it is a two player cooperative game.

I thouroughly enjoy the difficulty of winning this game. Needing to always have someone in sync, and reach the emotions needed can be really intense, especially with not speaking to the other opponent. It pulls you in to read their slights hints of body language as you are about to take one of their cards, and wonder is what you see really the best thing for this relationship? Love this game, my husband, not so much. -He dislikes games that lack in player interaction. 

It's in great condition. Possibly some slight wear on the corners of box. -Will update if interested of exact box condition.

RATING: 5
This game is great for playing with my wife.  It's a cooperative, relational abstract 2-player game.  The colors on the nodes are emotions (red-anger, black-sad, blue-calm, green-happy), and the cards have two colors on them each, and are labeled with more complex emotions (green-black is confused, for instance).

You can't communicate directly with your partner about what they "need" to do; instead, you have to be paying attention to your partner and be sensitive with them.

The only thing I don't like is that it seems a little too easy to win, even though there are multiple lose conditions.  We've won every time now.  But I am a strategy gamer and I know not everyone will have this problem.

I give this game high marks for conceptualizing a theme that's actually very important and unique.

I love the theme, but I was disappointed that it didn't really translate into that much communication game play. A few times we pointed, a few times I gave a thumbs up, but that's about it. The game can be surprisingly difficult to beat if your luck sucks; also, it requires little skill or strategy - you only really have a few choices each turn, many times only one choice. It's got a pleasing aesthetic though, and not talking is kinda nice, so I would definitely play this again if I was in the mood to just chill and play a game but not think too hard.

Played this in a 10x10 challenge, and it really was really starting to lose it's luster towards the end. It's still great, and we'll definitely pull it out here and there. But it doesn't have any staying power beyond just a handful of the first few "wow, this is such a cool concept game!" plays. The game is pretty easy to solve once you get the basic strategy down (*spoiler* staying in balance trumps everything else). We were only losing towards the end if we got unlucky and got trapped at the beginning (since the beginning is actually hardest part of the game with your limited options). I'd still recommend this game to most gamer couples who would enjoy a light to medium-light game to quiet the night down with.

RATING: 2
Having heard of it briefly through the usually excellent Shut Up and Sit Down gamesite, I figured it seemed a quick easy build. But what a let down.

This game in it's current state is a prototype, and a badly playtested one at that.  

There were pretty big design flaws with the board, chiefly, unusable and irrelevant lines that the designers originally insisted were there for aesthetic reasons only, a naive mistake to be generous, and idiotic to be less so.

Most of the praise heaped on this is all about the unique theme.  Hmm. On your turn, your objective might be to land on a "sad" space. What? How is that thematic?  "Look, I'm a bit down right now, it might even be clinical depression possibly, but, hey, it's where I always wanted to be".  But if it's where you want to be then there must inherently be some modicum of contentment or sense of achievement, even resignation to your fate will give you an existentialist balance.  Thematic my arse.

Also, NO TALKING. That's right, a two player game where you mostly HAVE TO shut up. It's in the rules, no discussing of the game. Which leads me to conclude this is not a game in my definition of the word. Mainly, a sociable and/or enjoyable pastime. 

It is also quite easy to find yourself in a position where it is impossible to win if you haven't maneuvered in a specific sequence on your last few turns of the game. Again, the designers had to come up with some retro-ruling to allow you to move backwards to sort this out.  

There are other aspects to this that are about "theme", for example, each player has their own draw pile of objectives, but you can complete each others objective, so...what's the point rather than having a single pile with two available objectives?  Complicating rules just for the sake of it is not "theme", it is inexperience. 

This might be an interesting little throwaway project, but any game that explains that players have to "synergistically move around their psyche to reach an emotional balance" makes me want to vomit up my metaphorical soy latte.

This is a pretty dull little abstract game. The turns are not especially interesting, with decisions severely limited on your turn.  It gets mildly more involved once you're on the innermost ring where the chance of you blocking each other's movement is finally a possibility but by now you will be wishing you were playing something else.

Each time I see a post saying "Kickstart this!" I wonder, why?! I took the time to print, make and play this, the thought of paying for it is frankly ridiculous.  And, oh my life, people saying they want to use it in counseling sessions as a tool. Give me strength.

We wanted to love this soo much! My husband and I were excited to play a game that was strategic, challenging, cooperative, and relationship-themed. We were excited about Marie Cardouat's art also. Unfortunately, I was a bit disappointed, mainly because we did not think this game was quite challenging enough. We've played this about 10 times now, without talking, and we've beat it each time. Also, the emotional/relationship stuff isn't really factor in the play. The artwork is lovely, and it's relaxing and small enough to bring out to a bar for a chill game+beer date, but I'm not sure about the longevity of this one.

interesting abstract coop that requires you to really pay attention to your partner and while I feel it therefore does need the "play without talking" rule, it also kind of takes the fun out of a coop game for me which is a lot about planning together.

Everything about this game is strange, starting with the spelling of the title...

This is, hands down, the best 2P only, abstract  cooperative filler card game about mending broken relationships.

Seriously though, I appreciate the intuitiveness that is required from players to read their partner when playing. There is absolutely no talking about strategy, but it's all in the body language, facial expression, etc. There's a lot to communicate without a single hand gesture or word. Pretty cool game, even if it is an abstract.

RATING: 6
"...and then, we held hands." is a two-player cooperative game about building a successful relationship with your partner. Despite the unusual theme, the game is basically an abstract--using colored movement cards to move pawns around the board didn't feel at all thematic. This is a no-communication game in which the key is to play both players turns in your head to maximize efficiency, and hope your partner comes to the same conclusion. Because of this, I didn't mind the cooperative play as much (I usually don't like co-ops), but it still felt more like an exercise than a game to me.

A co-op for Valentine's '17.  Our first try we got quite close, but I was 'out of sync' for a '0 balanced' finish and ran out of cards after 4 or 5 futile attempts.

Our second game ended after 3 moves.

I will rate this after more attempts.

Our copy of this game had 4 counters, 2 brown, 2 purple, which were completely indistinguishable in normal lighting (had to hold them up to a window to see the difference) so we had to use Pente pieces.  Disappointing.

RATING: N/A
I loved this game... unfortunately my partner not as much.  Which was devastating to finish it and win and going "Lets do that again" and she was like "meh".  It gets very strategic and increasingly so as you move on and the end game can get complicated when you can't talk about your strategy - that being said if you and your partner are both into higher strategy this works well as a couple strategy game.

This is an ok puzzle game for 2 players. I was expecting a lot more from the theme than it gave. The card art looked nice in pictures, but the linen quality of the cards muddied the colors. Nobody I played this with really understood the purpose of the emotions printed on the player cards. The game emphasizes that you aren't supposed to talk about the game while playing, but you don't really need to, as you can plainly see from the other player's cards and position what they need to do on their next turn. It's fine I guess, but not a keeper for me. I was hoping for something really innovative.

I EXPECTED: A whimsical, bleeding-heart, touchy feeling game where you gaze at your partner with a quivering lip and shed a little tear...how beautiful!

IN REALITY: a great card game of hand management and board balance with your team mate. The level of player interaction was spot on. And the game is HARD! A real nice puzzle they put together on this one.

COMPONENT QUALITY: HIGH perfect sized box for a card game, small and compact enough for a plane trip. It will always go with me. The artwork is top-notch!

The one thing this game has going for it is an amazing title. Beyond that, it was a disappointment in every way. I bought it as an anniversary gift so we tried extra hard to give it a chance but at the end of every game we're still left with a feeling of "that's it?" Some cooperative games can be played solitaire but for this game in particular there's not even that much of a solitaire game underneath since it largely plays itself once you know the obvious choices to make. We really wanted this to be enjoyable so we were extra-lenient with it. It didn't scratch any itch at all though. The one thing we haven't tried is playing with the arguments (we just couldn't motivate ourselves after so many lackluster plays of the base game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fairly unique game, with a mechanic I haven't really seen anywhere else. A 2 player game where both players must work together closely, without communicating their plans. Balance is critically important, yet always tough to achieve.

It's a simple game concept, yet can be fiendishly difficult to win. I think we've won a bit over half of the times we play, the challenge makes it quite fulfilling when you pull off a victory!

An interesting little filler game. Not a surefire go-to game, but not one to ignore either.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a pleasing game that is very easy if played in sync.  It has good theme integration -- you need to help each other, but if you take too much from your partner then things fall apart.

However, it really is too easy if you are in sync.  I know that's the point, but its not all that interesting.  For a team building / relationship building game I prefer hard coops where we discuss strategy rather than easy coops where we cannot talk.  This game is also a bit repetitive, the first 24 turns are pretty much the same thing over and over -- once again, that may be thematic and therapeutic, but it is not engaging.

As a therapeutic game:  7/10
As a strategy game:  5/10
Played with discussion with kids:  6/10

At first glance I thought this game would be a bit simple. But wow, there is a lot of depth here, particularly with the advanced play (which I recommend, but prepare to get whooped). Some games, depending on the timing of the cards, I think may be impossible to win (particularly on harder difficulties) but don't let that fool you on just how much what the players do matters. The 'no talking' is both interesting and frustrating, and very thematic. This could certainly move up ratings with further plays, but also I am wary that the randomness of the cards might kill that possibility.

"...and then, we held hands" is a game very simple to teach and to play. I played it first with my "non-gamer" girlfriend, who loved it at first sight. Despite the simple mechanics the game has a lot of different strategies which include the "hand management". You and your partner must make the plays in a way that you keep the more different emotion cards in your hands you can, in order to not being stuck. If you cannot move, you lose the game. The game also has some different difficulties levels, which is good for a second and third more challenging play.

I saw the buzz from this game when it won the print-and-play contest on BGG and really liked the design. When I saw there was a kickstarter for it with Marie's work, I jumped at the chance. My wife and I originally were not that impressed, but when we upped the difficulty with the arguments we have really been enjoying the challenge. A fast cooperative that is enjoyable when we only have a few minutes. Recommended!

Some clever stuff but felt it was going on too long, abstract and a little bland. Fantastic art and maybe this opinion would change if I played with partner and more strictly followed the communication rules but have little incentive to do so. The communication restriction in Hanabi creates a very tangible sense of tension which I leads to a range of laughter and general mirth, here it is more frustration.

A strange little card game for two players only, the theme here is largely ridiculous and doesn't translate very well to the actual gameplay, but that gameplay itself is solid and clever, so I've enjoyed my time with this and look forward to more. It's a curious item.

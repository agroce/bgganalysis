Wanted to like this more, but turned into a luck fest. Will you draw the right card, will others play the part you need (to save you an action and let you draw more). Felt I had pretty much explored it all after the first game.

Really fun game. Played through with the family about 6 times in a row. We probably would have kept playing if it wasn't too late in the evening.

Simple game. Play time for a group of 5 was probably closer to 30 minutes rather than the stated 60 on the game, especially when you get the hang of it.

High replay value. We had it unopened for a year and in the first time playing it played it more than anything else we've owened honestly. We all had a really great time playing it.

Played at MeepleCon 2017.  Okay game, but too light.  Goal is to build their dirigible completely first.  Cards exist to hinder other's building.  Also has an element of a set collection.

I bought this on a whim one day when my year old son was making a lot of noise and being a general PITA at our FLGS while we played King of Tokyo with his siblings.  I felt guilt, so I grabbed this one on our way out.  Turns out it's a hidden gem, we all really enjoy it, but I do wish that the player mats were of higher quality.  I'd be willing to pay extra for that.

my wife and I played in a demo of this at GenCon over the weekend and were quite pleased with it.  had to purchase a copy there.  it is a straight up game, but with a lot of hidden strategy to it.  fun and fast, with up to 5 players possible (and Great artwork too).  at an MSRP of $20, it is a great buy!

A simple, quick take-that sort of game. Big luck of the draw between desired pieces, desired types, and actions of variable value.
You want to ensure that you can piggy-back off of other players' actions, but at least that you can't accidentally replace your good dirigible pieces with bad.

"Action" cards are needlessly complex and scale poorly on player count due to differing turn count--inhibiting piggybacking to the point of being largely undesirable at higher counts.

Golly..bought it on a whim...played once and may never play again..only stays in the collection because the collection ain't substantial yet...IT JUST WASN'T FUN...and are games not to be fun? The weird folded up sheets are annoying as well.

A light pleasant filler, components are well designed (although I really want to laminate the dirgible sheets).  It certainly doesn't taken a hour though, more like 20 minutes.  A cute piece of fluff with some take that player interaction. Have promo card from GenCon 2016.

This is a simple steampunk game that's better played when the rules are understood. The problem is, the rule book is fairly confusing and not easy-pickup deal. Which is crazy because the game itself is, as stated, simple.

FUN: it's a quick and easy filler game with a nice theme, but it's also a lot more subtle then you would expect from reading the rules.

UNIQUE: I have never seen this mechanic before where one player's action forces the other players to perform the same action. It works really well.

NEGATIVES: luck of the draw has a bigger influence then I'd like.

DASTARDLY DIRIGIBLES is a Steampunk themed “model” building game.Each player has a blueprint for their airship in front of them with 7 parts.  The parts are in 9  suits in the deck of cards.  Players get three actions a turn, which include adding parts to their ship… the tricky caveat is that when 1 player lays down a part, ALL players add that part to their ship if they have a card in their hands. So you may be real close to having a ship of all one suit (which is mega points), but then the players around you all lay down parts you have to replace. There are also specialty cards that allow you to do things like take from the discard pile, make another player remove a part from their ship etc.  It’s played in 3 rounds with points being tallied (you earn points based on the number of matching suited parts on your airship) so if you have an empty ship in one round it’s not the end of the game for you. Dastardly Dirigibles canbe played 2-5 players…. 3 -5 is best as there’s more chances for other players to foil your airship building plans! This one may be my new favorite game! A++

Fun filler, but the people I played with were thinking a bit too much for what I think the game should be, making it less fun for me - I felt like I did a lot of waiting, where there should be something to do on everyone's turn.

A daughter in law pick. A lite set collection filler. You are trying to build an airship with with several parts that can come from different suits. The goal is to have the mostly built from one suit. The neat aspect that if one player plays a part all the other players must play the same part even if it messes up their current suit layout. Include some action/take that cards and it is a little more subtle that just draw a card. While it is dependent on the luck of the draw, playing 3 rounds evens it out some. 
Liked the steampunk artwork on the dirigibles.

Good for a light family game.

From Spirit Games

A wifey pick...and approved. After initial training game, looks promising. Has a good balance between luck and strategic use of card play.

Played over 3 rounds, the idea of each round is to be the first to complete the 7 parts of your dirigible. Gaining points for being the first to complete and also bonus points for either having multiples of one type (suit) or better still to have just 1 of each of the 7 suits. There are also WILD suits which count only with the suit you have the most of...

Each player has a hand of 5 cards (drawing back up to that amount if needed at the beginning of your turn), and an emporium of face up cards is placed in the middle of the table equal to the amount of player. You have 3 actions to take.

1. Play a card to your dirigible plan sheet or play a special action card
2. Discard a card
3. Swap a card from your hand to one from the emporium
4. Replaced all cards in the emporium
5. Pass

Liking the gameplay where everyone has to play the same part the player on turn builds on their derigible if they have it in their hand. This can easily mess up the best laid plans as you have to play over a card you've already built if you have the same part... hence a little strategy comes into play as to possibly using the discard card action on your turn... 

Plays ok with 2, better with 4

light filler game where you build your zeppelin with cards. Each card represents a part of your zeppelin, and there are different suits. The tricky part is that when another player plays a zeppelin part and you have the same part in your hand you HAVE to follow and place that part in your zeppelin, even if that screws up your plan, because you only get to score the parts of the same suit. There are also event cards that can mess with your or other players' zeps. I like it, feels different enough to keep in my collection.

After having owned this for a year, I finally got it on the table.  With a full 5 player count, you may only get 2 turns per round.  Based on this one play only, I recommend going with either 3 or 4 players max.  Having said that, it's fun, very lighthearted, quick, and the scoring is low.  There is a take that element in the game, but I did not find it intrusive or crushing.  the ruleset is clean, the art is good, gameplay good.  It's not going to wow you or make you hold your breath, however, it's a fun filler.  With more plays the subtleties and perhaps some awesomeness may emerge.

Simple set collection game with some take that cards-- I added this to my collection because I wanted more options for the kids (ages 5 & 7).  Works well for us because it is simple enough for the kids to play on their own, and they love the theme.  Nothing ground breaking, but it is fun and has just enough strategy to keep it interesting as an occasional filler.  Picked it up for $10, but I don't think it's worth more than that.

Played with 5 friends for the first time. We had a blast. The only thing I did not like are the playing mats. Due to them being folded to fit in the box they won't lay flat. I need to mount them on some boards and put them in a bigger box.  The game play is fast and trying to get the most points is a challenge.

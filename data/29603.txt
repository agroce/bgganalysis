RATING: 7
This has taken multiple false-starts simply to get the game rules down solid. The game provides a deep appreciation for what many brave young men did on that day against some incredible odds.

The second part of the game bogs down almost instantly for me. It's almost anticlimactic in two ways: 

First, it's brutal enough just getting off of the beach. That in itself is a challenge, and the game masters the feeling of dread in that endeavor perfectly. It's sheer brutality.

Second, the rules governing the fight inland are different, and the sheer volume of new ideas that are presented in the rules quite literally put this back in the box once the beach phase is pretty much through.

One day, I'll have more patience for this... this is STILL a fantastic title.

RATING: 9
An incredible satisfying solitaire of the Omaha Beachhead assault...and one of the few Solitaire (could also be played as a 2 player) that actually feel historical, while still quite playable and full of choices, challenges and replayability. 

Mr. Butterfield has done a terrific job with this one,
only problem with it is some of the lesser tasks that don't add much to the gameplay, e.g. : though historical, I have a feeling the beach mines removal should have been abstracted, as its influence on the game is marginal at best, which results in a phase that is essentially an annoyance.

One of the best (if not the BEST) Solo wargames i played ever. Incredible AI makes for very tough but challenging games. The diceless system is superb, and the tactical choices you need to make makes you understand a bit more of what happened and how on D-Day at Omaha Beach.

The transition from the Chaos of the initial landings to the formation of something close to a proper fighting force on a Regimental level on the High Ground is really something worth to experience for any wargamer out there.

Highly recommended.

DDaOB is one of the most innovative solitaire games I have come across.  That is how John Butterfield rolls.

The rules are well-written and the the game is steeped in theme.

I find it to be a bit tedious, so I only play the 1-map scenario.  I also find the bocage part of the game to be dull.  I would rather play Breakout: Normandy once I am off the beach.

Be warned: if you are color blind, do not play this game.

A fantastic study of D-Day. DG has struck gold with mechanics developed in this first opus. The card system offers enough variance to make replays enjoyable, but is carefully balanced to offer a tough challenge every time. The rules are relatively simple and elegant, although in the first few turns you will often spend more time resolving German actions then taking your own. This changes over time, thankfully.

Note however that the game rightfully styles itself "a study": winning will not occur often. With the outcome of D-Day as a whole not a fore come conclusion, Omaha was won by a thread. A few things going wrong in the early turns will prevent a player's victory, which while realistic can be frustrating for some. However, the game remains intensely enjoyable when playing under mindset, such as "how far would they have gone under THOSE circumstances?" It should be noted that while catastrophic defeat is possible, it remains very rare after a couple of games' experience under the belt.

The game contains an introductory scenario, an early scenario covering the initial landing, a late scenario covering moving beyond the beach, and a campaign jointing the first and second scenarios. Playing time can be long, 2 to 3 hours for a scenario if you know what you're doing. The map is large and unmounted, and some cover is preferable.

2 more opera are available, covering the theatres at Tarawa and Peleliu. They include additional rules for Japanese troops. But Omaha remains my favorite: the rules have been developed for and work best to describe the initial terror and confusion of the landing on these Normandy beaches. I believe this game is war gaming classic.

RATING: 10
This game is simply amazing.

Designing a solitaire game with an "Artificial Intelligence" that works and plays like a tough adversary must be one of the hardest things designers have been trying to pull off over the years. Other popular solitaire designs, such as B-17, will only take you through a fun ride where there's not much you can do about your survival prospects.

Well, in this game, not only the german "player" will make you suffer like Tom Hanks' rangers at the start of "Saving Private Ryan", but also the design will  offer you inumerous tough tactical decisions that will make you think you're really in control and ultimately responsible for what happens to your men. The AI mechanics fires at you where you're most vulnerable, it makes german reinforcements show up exactly at the right moment you were about to conquer a vital spot, and when you start moving US troops and equipment all over the high ground, they will follow and sometimes anticipate your movement and screw your plans up. And it's your job to anticipate the AI "decisions" and slowly create a perimeter around the draws (beach exits), get your tanks and artillery pieces off the beach and establish strongpoints on the VP spots on the high ground.

It is definitely not one of those designs where the system just unleashes hell at you in a blind, stupid matter. The AI at D-day is intelligent, and will challenge you everytime you try to assault this beach.

Replayability is quite high. I've won games by conquering draws and penetrating my troops and equipment quite deeply in one half of the beach, while my soldiers kept being pinned down on the sands of the other half, while in some games I've been able to advance uniformely all over. You really don't know how things will unfold each time you play.

D-Day at Omaha Beach is not only a great option for when you don't have a lot of wargaming buddies around to play. D-Day is a great design in and on itself and should be tried by all wargame lovers out there.

I still haven't tried playing it with 2 players together against the german AI. It must be fun.

It is the hottest wargame in my collection right now. Can't wait for D-Day at Tarawa and D-Day at Peleliu, both with realease dates in 2014.

Rating after two plays, one of them complete.  A catastrophic loss on turn 10 of the First Waves Scenario.  By the end I was feeling pretty good about the rules and seemed to be in a nice rhythm.  I used the flip book available in the files section, but to be honest I think I was able to understand from the rule book better than the flip book.  I will probably play on vassal more than the physical copy just to work through ideas and strategies faster, and also to memorize the rules better, but this one just feels good on the table and is fun to analyze all the units as they are spread out and moving around on the map.

First Impression: This impressive solitaire game succeeds in reliving the story of the D-Day landing. The card-driven AI and event system is pure genius. This game plays well cooperatively as well. The rules are manageable but the game is challenging.

10 Plays: This game is still challenging, as there's no fixed recipe for victory. The Extended game is still highly challenging and I find that the transition takes some getting used to. This game is not leaving my table anytime soon.

     I've just started to play this game, and it lives up to its excellent billing.  It has a lot of unpredictability and excitement as one tries to get through the withering fire and take out dug in positions.  The randomness makes one have to improvise new plans when previous ones are nullified by in-game events.  
      A couple of minor quibbles are that the counters are hard to remove and may get a bit dog-eared in the process and that the colors can be hard to decipher for those of us who are color blind.

Despite the not so good components this is a marvelous solo game to play.

Is this more "realistic" than a simple game like DDay Memoir 44? Fun is about equal. But this game is far more historical. Stick with the Memoir 44 DDay if you just want to roll dice with friends and have crazy fun in a group.

This version though is a very good solitaire game, but it needs at least 2 or 3 full sessions to appreciate it. I love Ambush, an earlier design of the maker, but this is getting close. Less replayability but great historical references.

I will wait to compare it with the Conflict of Heroes solo system in a few weeks... to see which games wins the solo battle of wargaming (still held by Ambush btw).

When playing you NEED the Flip Book created by one of our BGG members or the game risks to be folded within the hour for many more casual gamers.

After several play, top 10 material both in solo games as in wargames.

Rather impossible to win against the set score of 19 points. I got to 12 VP once, but mostly it is a wipe before turn 16 even !

2nd Edition.  Rating after four plays.  First play was very much a struggle with the mechanics.  Second play went much easier and I had a better idea of tactics (plus great luck I think).  Still much to learn and discover.  I am a little leery of how much this still feels like a struggle against the mechanics rather than an exercise of tactical skill.  

Never did get back to it.  I didn't get that immersion feeling of being part of a heroic story, always felt like I was just trying to optimize the mechanics

I got my first play of this at the 2010 WBC.  John Butterfield, the designer, ran a demo for my friend and I in the Open Gaming room one evening for about 4 hours!

I think that this game is brilliant. The gameplay is very slick - all the German actions are controlled by a single deck of cards (and charts), no dice at all.  And beyond that, the narrative is amazing.  You can feel the tension of trying to get your forces safely on the beach while they are getting pummeled by machine gun fire. And that tide is always rising...

I have played the first intro scenario and the game really is looking good.
The combination between the randomness in the cards and the tactics you need to do, makes this a true gem in single player games.
I guess that there will be bigger challanges when you use all the rules there are.
All the dots on the map didn't look to good in the beginning, but that is no longer an issue.

After 3 full plays of the First Waves I can say that this is a very challenging game and it will see my table from time to time.  It has been a bit of a frustrating learning experience but perhaps I am just not using the correct strategy as most of my boys get mowed down and then picked off once they reach the safety hexes on the beach.  Still, the game is fun and the system is great so it is a game I will keep and play periodically.

Having now played all the D-day at games, I have to say that this is my least favorite.  This one just feels too overwhelming to me whereas in the other games I feel like I at least have a fighting chance.  Might be good history, but not as much fun to game.

This looks is another excellent design from John Butterfield. Cards and chits provide the random element. There are a fair few variants in there to change up the basic scenario, which is a big plus in my book. Limited command resources in the early phases of the landing force tough decisions on the player and there is constant tension between making progress and minimising casualties.

I played the introductory scenario three times in the first weekend of ownership, and (I can't stress this enough) I have a life outside gaming.

This title is a great value.  A narrative unfolds during each game.  The game where you got no heroes, the game where that damn Green Nest kept getting reinforced ... the game where you were a turn from winning.

Sure there are longer scenarios to discover and enjoy, but the best ones are still on the Beaches. 

I have played the full campaign once, and things begin to drag when you get into the bocage.  The possible German responses become more complex.  I suspect a lack of familiarity with the bocage rules is part of the issue.  The management overhead associated with the AI got to be a bit much. It's also a bit anti-climatic.  I mean if the invasion takes hold, victory in the strategic sense becomes inevitable - doing better than the historical result holds little interest in the hex by hex grind of the bocage.

The bocage portion of the game seems quite abstract as well, whereas on the beaches, the AI response often paints a gripping narrative.  Perhaps the increased AI maintenance detracts for the illusion?

I don't want to focus on the negatives of the bocage scenario.  This game is about the struggle for Omaha Beach and the beach landings are good scenarios.  Although the game is very innovative, most mechanics are picked up quickly.

D-Day at Omaha Beach gets my vote for best wargame of 2009 and most innovative game in a decade.  I suspect that the two beach scenarios will get played many more times than the full campaign or bocage only ones.

I recommend the game if you're at all interested in the battle for Omaha Beach.  This is a well done, tough to win struggle, that is well worth the price of admission.  I'm glad I got my copy, expect to play it more, and will seriously consider any and all sequels.

UPDATE:
It's been over a year since I last played the game and I have found that I have no desire to take it off the shelf.  I've docked the ratings accordingly.  When I do consider playing the game again, it's always Easy Fox or The First Waves scenarios.  I seriously doubt that I'll ever play the Full Campaign or Off the Beach scenarios again - too much work for too little payback.  But then, despite the fact that I enjoy playing games solitaire, I've never cared for solitaire games.

Scenario Ratings:
Easy Fox - 8 (4 plays)
First Waves scenario - 7 (2 plays)
The full campaign scenario - 5 (1 play)
Off the Beach - NR (0 plays)

2011-03-12: This is a really awesome design and a really great solitaire game.  The AI is tough, but not so tough that you can't win.  The Victory conditions can be a bit convoluted, especially when determining whether you "control" a draw or not, but otherwise, this is a really great system.  This is probably my "go to" solitaire game.  I am trying to get my friend to learn the system so that we can play two-player against the AI.  The game does take a couple of plays to figure out the correct strategy - for instance, the first game I kept trying to save all my hardware on the beach (the tanks, artillery, etc), but part of the game is letting most of that stuff go . . . you have to get those infantry units up the beach!  Highly recommended for any WWII enthusiast who wants a solid solitaire game on the Omaha Beach landings.  The basic game (16 turns) can be played in 3 hours, once you know the system.

2015-08-06: My affinity for the game remains about the same as it was over 4.5 years ago.  Fun game.  I finished the First Waves last night with a victory.  I am setting up to try the full campaign next.

Well-written rulebook (no index, but rulebook not large enough to absolutely require one, and table of contents is good); rules are innovative and easy to learn. Map is busy, colours are initially off-putting. But a superbly functional map that makes my job as player easier.

Read the rules once, and then played the game. Took a few turns to "get it". After that, what an exciting and enjoyable game this is. How did the designer compress so much fun, variety and interesting situations into a game that is so quick and easy to learn? A marvel of game design.

The crucial test will come with a few more plays: replayability. For now I'm in solitaire gaming heaven.

What a great game. Very tough to win, but that doesn't really matter. What makes it fun is dealing with the tactical challenge that it presents every time. I especially like that establishing and expanding allied command and control (C2), logistical support (Engineers), and getting artillery into the fight is critical to success in the complete game and all are difficult to get right. You can't just push infantry factors around expecting them to do everything on their own.

A great solitaire game focused on the D-Day landings at Omaha Beach.  It took me a few games of the intro scenario to figure out the rules, but now they are pretty straight forward to me (at least the rules for the initial landings).  I like the mechanic that has Germans popping up all over your axis of advance, the concepts of depth requiring special weapons and tactics to defeat them, and how it mixes in artillery and the chaos of warfare through the action cards.  It seems to me that unlucky draws (e.g. nothing but German reinforcements and depth) can easily squash your chances of doing well, but it is fun nonetheless - you just have to grin and bear it, probably like the real commanders did.  I am looking forward to introducing this to my friends and playing the 2-player variant.  This will likely get a lot of plays out of me and I'm looking forward to each and every one of them!

(Why, oh why, can't Fields of Fire play this smoothly?)

Okay, let's begin.

John Butterfield has once again created a masterpiece of solitaire wargaming. The rules are clear and well written, turn sequence is smooth and clean and simple, it's a game you can skim the rules and jump right in (making mistakes, certainly), but experimenting quickly none-the-less. The action is terrific, the game's "AI", especially in the first half of the game, works wonderfully, it's tense and dramatic, and the mechanics using the cards are inspirationally good.

This is a stellar game ... the more I play, the more I utterly enjoy this title.

One of the finest solitaire games I've ever played. Comes very close to setting the gold standard for solitaire wargames.

A strong "8" rating ... close to a "9" for me.

Excellent balance of player choices and admining the solitaire AI. Also has the benefit of having two games in the box, as turns 17-34 play very differently (once you've gotten onto the beach and started to work inland).

RATING: 10
The best solitaire-only design I’ve played, along with RAF. Amazing these two quite different games come from the same designer.

Intuitive to learn and absorb, procedural without being rote, fast-playing and intense once you grasp the scheme of things.  Highly immersive, you will experience the desperation and horror facing the invaders as they discover the pre-landing air and sea bombardment Has Not Worked and the mission faces utter catastrophe. Can you adapt and overcome, as they did?  It won’t be easy! Inclusion of a well-written and referenced article by the designer helps set the stage.  Alternatively, watch the first half hour of Saving Private Ryan; this game credibly evokes that tour de force.

You must employ historical tactics.  Use “free” preservation movement to get your infantry to the shelter of the seawall or shingle ASAP.  If they huddle in place on the beach they die!  A lot of them will die anyway running the gauntlet of plotted firezones, but enough will make it so that you can focus on eliminating some of the Wiederstandnests. Use Rangers and General/HQ- or hero-led infantry to attack these deadly forts from multiple sides. Supporting fire from tanks (those that survive the landing) or AA units is invaluable.  You won’t take out all these positions with the first two regiments to land, but even eliminating a few will make the job of getting off the beach much easier. But then you have deadly hedgerows and ambush alleys to contend with... 

For all that, I find it near impossible to win.  I rarely have enough survivors from the first waves to control any draws.  And yet I keep playing.  Sometimes I cheat… err “house-rule” to play the extended game (which carries the fight from the beach to the coastal interior), letting a few companies “reform” at reduced strength after command posts have been established.  Perhaps the game’s most amazing accomplishment is how it creates the illusion of a sentient opponent.  No two plays feel alike, so replayability is high.  Indeed, this game is addictive.

There’s been a lot of talk about the map, specifically those colored dots that offend some delicate eyes. I’m here to tell you those dots (which mark firezones and eliminate much tedious LOS discernment) are one of the greatest things about this brilliant design.  The real problem with the map is that hexsides which impact combat like slope/bluff/cliff are not distinguished with sufficient clarity.  Compounding the problem, they are depicted in slightly different hues on the Terrain Chart.  The rules lack an index, and there are a few ambiguities, but the game has a thriving community and is actively supported by the designer, so I’ve found answers to nearly all my questions. 

My final reservation concerns components. Counters must be hacked from their sprues, and the resulting hanging chads will make you a clipper if you’re not already.  The charts (which you’ll use a lot) are made of cheap absorbent cardstock; I recommend transparent sheet covers or sleeves.  There aren’t any markers for important things like communication and area control (an important victory condition factor), and there should be a printed OOB to better keep track of all the units queuing to land. This masterpiece deserves better.
 
All that said, if you are a solitaire wargamer this is a must, and if any kind of wargamer it’s well worth checking out!

Very high quality throughout, once the rules start to click you will understand how elegant and intertwined the game mechanics simulate that long day.  I love games like Eldritch Horror, Mage Knight, and Android:Netrunner, but D-day at Omaha Beach is still probably my highest ranked game and my go-to when I am not sure what I want to play for a solitaire game.  Oh, and I have got my wife to play co-op after she watched me play a couple times and then got her even more interested after watching Saving Private Ryan.  We play as separate commanders, leaving the room when not our time to play, leaving short notes (battlefield radio) on what are next turn plans are four our side of the beach, then watching those plans crumble under the pressure of mounting casualties, forcing us to constantly adapt.  She will not touch any other war game I own!?!WTF!!!??!!
  Solid 10.

RATING: 9
Very clever system that's not overly simple but is quite easy to play.  The map looks wacky at first glance but in terms of functionality it's a work of absolute genius.

My rating is likely to move -- I'm reserving final judgment until I determine whether the game's brutality is due to me not having cracked the strategy or to the cards being stacked against the player.  But I will definitely enjoy the research!

EDIT: Upped the rating.  I've played a few times now and each game has told a quite different story.  There's more replayability than one might expect.

EDIT: The cards are definitely stacked against the player -- German units re-spawn like in a videogame, and you can't control a VP hex unless there are no Germans around.  If the cards don't turn *very* favorably, fuggedaboutit. (To clarify: you can capture a VP hex and then have Germans magically appear too late for you to do anything about 'em. I'm upping my rating anyway because this game is just so danged original and fun.)

Of course, since it's a solitaire game, there's no opponent to be annoyed by whining.  ;)

This truly is a great solitaire game.  Although I am not much of a wargamer, it remains accessible and because it is unlike anything in my collection finds a permanent spot.  All solo-gamers should give this one a try... much a status as Ambush used to hold.

Really good solitaire wargame - innovative and realistic enemy activation system. The game doesn't allow for much strategy but there are tactical choices in abundance and it captures the chaos of the landing and desperate struggle to overcome the beach defenses amazingly well. 

Right up there with Raid on St Nazaire for atmosphere and immersion.

Loses half a mark for the slightly fiddly German activation/action responses after the mid-point in the game. It would also have been nice to have the charts condensed to one card (front and back) - they currently run across 3 cards and the reverse of the colour example booklet. I have reworked these myself now and posted to the file section on BGG - can be printed as a narrow strip to sit in front of the board.

Excellent historical insert concerning the battle as well - deserves the high marks.

RATING: 9
Solitaire wargame featuring the landings of the 1st and 29th US divisions on Omaha Beach on D-Day.  The game covers the entire day, and features the landing, the clearing of the beach and Widerstandnests, then the push inland.  US units are company level, with platoon steps.  So much innovative stuff here - the map is very well designed, showing fields of fire and eliminating the need for line of sight rules; hidden German units come with hidden "depth" markers of varying strength and weapons requirements for taking them out; diceless combat system; many game features controlled by a simple deck of cards... four different scenarios of varying length and complexity.  Takes a bit of understanding, but it's not complex, just different.  Tough challenge on the player too.  Great rules, excellent components, engrossing game ... basically puts Fields of Fire by GMT away for good.

Comments after 1 game... which will definitively not be the last.
Becoming more and more of a John Butterfield fan as i play more of his games. Had played Operation: Jubile first and, while the systems are very similar, they are not the same. This game feels a little slower, which is not a bad thing and enemy units are more static, at least in the First Wave scenario (haven't played the full campaign yet, reserving that for after I've played the basic game a few more time).
Very strong narrative with rules that are at first not intuitive but once it clicks, the game just sings.

Great game, will be hitting the table often.

I'll admit I'm not one for solo games, but this one really captures the imagination. You can see the shingle on the beach, the bunkers, the overlapping fire arcs, the ciffs you need to scale, the whole bit. Lots of puzzles to figure out, lots of chaos as you try to cobble together the right forces to the right places.

I adore this game.  I thought maybe it would be standard wargame hype (high ratings, few votes), but this is a game even a non-wargamer can sink their teeth into.  The rules are among the clearest I've ever had the pleasure of reading and it plays nice and fast.  Hours will fly by without you noticing.  Just make sure you have decent lighting because green and slightly-lighter-green are hard to distinguish in the dark.

An instant classic from Butterfield.  Great simulation value, great fun, impeccable rules, ingenious AI system - you can't ask for much more from a solitaire wargame.  I find the map a bit jarring, but I understand the reason for the visual dominance of the various colored game symbols (which dominate the terrain itself).  It is the visual presentation that kept it from being a 10 for me, but the game is just so damn good that a rating of 9 seemed not to do it justice.  I have a feeling that if GMT or MMP (or Compass, or LnL, or a host of companies other than Decision) had of published this game, the physical presentation would have been so much better and it would have scored a perfect 10.

A really well designed solitaire only war game.  At first glance, the colored circles everywhere look a bit like a mess, but they are a really well designed system of AI.

Lots of fun and a good historical study at the same time.

2nd edition. I unfortunately must dissent from the popular opinion on this game.  It is very very fiddly and long.  90% of the fiddling around is for system upkeep, drifting, adding depth markers, determining enemy fire etc... i.e. things that require absolutely no decisions to be made.  This may be a great simulation of the battlefield decisions, i.e. get to the darn shingle without getting your #!@&$ head blown off!!! But that does not a fun game make.

Excellent solitaire game, one of the best ever made, very hard to fault.  Its historical, a good simulation, strategic and fun all rolled into one.  How many solitaire games out there can you play with two people, playing against the same solitaire system and still have fun?  This is a testament of the a solid system that really challenges the player with a sense that you're playing again a live opponent.

I felt that my real world strategies, which were better than those used on the actual D-Day Omaha battle, worked as planned (I have hindsight logic... General Cota didn't!) and the game simulated well enough to reward my strategic decisions.  I am sure that if I attacked straight up a draw without thinking, I would've been slaughtered like in real life.

I highly recommend this game to any war gamer, it won't change any Euro gamer's mind though, in its heart its a hardcore war game and I like that very much.

I rate this a [b]10 out of 10[/b], a must have for both the solitaire gamer and war gamer.

RATING: 7.5
This game is very thematic, and stays true feeling of the subject matter. It's definitely a war game in that there is a lot of fiddly parts, lots of small rules and symbols to remember. Overall, I'd say its not too difficult to get playing smoothly once you've played a few turns. Also, at first it doesn't seem too difficult to survive, but the rising tide mechanism forces you to push forward (which is tough when you can basically move only 2 units per turn, and some exceptions which get freebies).

There are no dice, it's all card driven, but it can still be quite random. (In a war-like kind of way of course, you've got to make do with what you're given.)

Component wise; the counters are horrible! Small, very difficult to punch...you MUST use an exacto knife, and more than likely a counter trimmer of some form for the edges. The map looks great, some claim it's too busy, but its all very functional. I also enjoyed the little historical pamphlet on D-Day, which got me in the mood to play and threw some facts my way I was not aware of.

Overall, I wish to explore this one some more. It's a fairly long game, even the standard invasion scenario which was 16 turns took about 3 hours. (I can't imagine the more advanced 32 turn full game!) But still, as a solo game it works exceptionally well.

Update - Love it! Great Solitaire game with different scenarios.  Read half the rulebook and you are ready to play the introduction and "first half".  Second half (battle for the high ground) has additional rules and different time scale.  Great Game.  Also Scenario supplied for just the second "half".  Will keep me occupied for many plays I believe.  Definitely worth it as the production is top notch including a 16-page historical supplement.  Beautiful.

A spectacular solitaire.  Very tense.  It took me only two half-plays to stumble my way through learning the rules (3 total hours).  If I'd read the rules it would've gone faster.

It took me 5 real tries to finally win the first scenario.  The situation is tight.  There's three things at work, strategy (concentration of effort), experience (knowing the general strengths of units/depth makes a huge difference), and luck (some cards kill).

Played three times Easy Fox and First Wave. Lost badly but interesting to play. The rules are very complete and you do not have to constantly refer to the forums (like another well known game I remember). I prefer pictures or silhouettes on the counters instead of standard military icons and the color signs on the map could be less prominent. This way the whole thing looks somewhat ugly. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 1 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1)
Edit: Lost the fourth game. I wonder how others win. When you lose all your tanks in the first or second turn it is nearly impossible to make any substantial progress towards the victory conditions. The fun diminishes considerably.

RATING: 7.5
D-Day at Omaha Beach is another meaty Solitaire game from John H Butterfield, focusing on the two American divisions at Omaha beach and their uphill struggle to survive and get off the beach before German defensive placements cut them to shreds.

Players land units amphibiously, undergo defensive fire, collect benefits or strengthen defensive positions (sometimes both) with events, and then finally get a very few actions to try to move forward, take German positions and move inland.

A deck of cards serves multiple purposes- landing determinations, events, and both German and some US combat resolutions.

While the game follows the general historic swing of the pitched battle, it also randomizes results via the deck, so that games are fresh, and available resources can vary greatly.

Even on a first play, using the easiest scenario, it is clear that for a hex and counter wargame, this one is elegant, engaging, and involves players in all phases of the game.

I'm starting D-Day at Omaha Beach at a 7.5, but this keeper definitely has a chance to go up from there.

The conditions of winning the game are hard to achieve. All in all a perfect solo game.

Not just the best solitaire game, but the best new game of any kind I've played in the last year.  Solitaire games can often be strong on narrative but offer few player choices (B-29, for example).  D-Day at Omaha Beach has the narrative, but there's a real game there with tough decisions as well.  The map and other physical systems handle things like line of sight and weapons selection very cleverly and with a minimum of rules, while the cards make it very replayable.

To begin the only two negatives I've discovered: The component quality (2nd printing 2013) leaves much to be desired. I swear, my copy of Ambush has better chits! The card stock is thin but the 57.5X80mm “Chimera” sleeves that Mayfair fixed that in short order. Next, the 

This is one of the iconic designs for solitaire wargames (thank you John Butterfield), and as such came to my table with large shoes to fill. I will say that while I am still in the initial “best game ever” phase on this one, I think it's a solid design and serves to both educate the player on the historical and military aspects of the engagement but to keep them immersed as well. It's reputation for difficulty ( to win, not to play) is will deserved.

The rulebook is straightforward and answered almost every question I had, save one regarding the fate of a 3 step unit and accumulated step loss, which was easily answered with a bgg forum query. That said, I wouldn't suggest a play-through without BGG user Jan Tuijp 's brilliant flip-book. I found BGG user AGKorson 's reference panel(s) to be very useful as well; once the mechanics become automatic it serves to avoid page flipping to reference US barrage Tables, German Fire tables and the like almost entirely.

Due to DdaOB's status in the (solitaire) wargaming pantheon, it's freakish historical accuracy and  it's dead-brilliant randomizing mechanics this title will likely be on my shelf for many years to come.

Excellent Game! I am primarily a solo war gamer, and this game is a homerun for me. Another great design by John Butterfield. The new 3rd edition mounted board is beautiful, however, I am not a huge fan of the counters. As a visual gamer who started in the hobby playing miniature games...the standard war game counters just don't do it for me. Other than that...this belongs on the shelf of every solo war gamer!

RATING: 7.5
Extremely clever design and high quality. I've only played the intro scenario thus far; my rating may increase with additional plays.

Update: Continues to be a high quality game through all types of play. Unfortunately it almost never sees the table due to high intensity and long hours required. Decided I had my fill after half a dozen plays. A great game, but if wargaming isn't your primary hobby it will probably not last long for you.

RATING: 8.5
A fascinating subject that I have an intense personal interest in -- especially since I am a volunteer tour guide at the National D-Day Memorial in Bedford VA.

Played a couple of early game scenarios, and have been pretty impressed. The game flows pretty quickly, and it's relatively easy to pick it up. Some nuances, but it comes together with a fews plays through.

Game is enjoyable, and certainly captures the tension and frustration, if not the outright terror, of Omaha. 

This is not an easy game to win. The Americans have a tough fight against the defenders, and my success rate is very low!

After playing its 2 little brothers, I'd have to say that I enjoy the theme of this one best.  But the others are good too, and have some improvements and challenges.

Took me a little while to get the real narrative sense but once I did I realized this game is both good as a historical simulation and as a story teller. Lots of good mechanics for the solo player that make decision making more than just calculation. While there is a very slight temptation to count cards it is not like RAF (see review) and still rewards narrative play where players don't worry about gaming the system and treat the counters as real people worth saving in their own right.

Amazing solitaire game which is just a beauty to play. You can just set up the game and then follow the instructions since it is so easy to follow and easy to play (mechanically). When you first see the map you might think it is busy, convoluted and diffcult to play on, but the opposite is the case. It really helps you to focus on the situation at hand.

Generally not interested in solitaire gaming, but interested in this because of comments on the [geeklist=57535]2010 CSR list[/geeklist], especially abendoso's.  And abendoso strikes again [article=5390343]here[/article].

After reading the reviews, I want this even more, but I still blame abendoso.

2010-09-24 - ordered.  Still blaming abendoso.

Update - after a play of Easy Fox, and a couple partial plays of The First Waves with the burrito boy (age 10) controlling one of the two divisions, things I like:
- the way the tide rises as the game goes on.
- the way you need different weapons to take out different positions, and how simply that's handled.  And how that information is provided on a need-to-know basis, ha ha.
- the way climbing slopes & cliffs is handled.

Things I don't like:
- the way landing checks are handled.  "OK, diamond... that's a C... this is infantry... on turn 3... is that a DG or CH beach?  OK, drift nine boxes east...  Next unit is a diamond... that's a C..."  About halfway through this process each turn I mutter, "goddammit, they have [i]computers[/i] for this %$@#!"  It doesn't take that long, but the time it [i]does[/i] take feels like unnecessarily complicated busy-work which could have been saved with a different design.
- this is based on only the few plays mentioned above, but the luck element in this game feels really strong.  Maybe that's the way it should be (and maybe it's not as strong as I think, because attacks against revealed units have no luck at all)... err, well, scratch this one, I guess.
- I'm not sure I'm that excited about how German fire is resolved.  I don't have a better way... and I haven't seen how it plays once you make it off the beach, but when you've got bunches of units on the beach in overlapping fields of fire, checking all of them (and keeping track of which ones have already taken a hit this turn) is a bit tedious.

This has reaffirmed my disinterest in solitaire games, ha ha.  I was only playing Easy Fox to learn how to play, and once I felt like I had a handle on it, I had no interest in the outcome.  The burrito boy likes the cooperative play, but that's the [i]only[/i] reason this is on the table.  (And even the cooperative play is ... us each playing our own game; there's very little we can do to help each other.)

1st and 29ers Yankee Divisions on the assault of Omaha Beach.  I am reading Joesph Bolkoski's book on the 29ers and so I am interested in this game.  Plus it is a game designed for solo play (2-players is an option too), for which vested confidence in John Butterfield's past design record of RAF and Ambush. 

A solitaire wargame I have but I don't have the time to play it yet. It should be a good one as told by other many stories. I am wanting to play it even more as John said this design was inspired by Joe Bolkoski's books on the D-Day campaign and I am still reading Beyond the Beachhead of the 29ers!

RATING: 9
Now after 5 or so plays of both Introductory Scenario and The First Waves I can put my comment here: this is an amazing game, my favourite solitaire game ever (I have played around 10 solitaire-only games, from DVG's Leader Series through RAF to Victory Point games) and the game that really makes me tremble when I look at my crippled forces and draw a card that may or may not leave me in even worse situation. Tension is unmatched, decisions are hard and important and every draw of the card makes my heart go faster. While playing I constantly think about both current situation as well as long term plans - will those positions that I really hope would not fire this turn actually fire and devastate my plans? Will my barrage be succesful? Is it better to keep barraging with Tanks to possibly disrupt as many Germans as possible or to start climbing cliffs with my Infantry in a direct attack? Is it worth trying to save every unit from the tide or maybe sacrifice a few weaker and less useful ones and spend actions on units already further on the beach? This is the only game (well OK, I sometimes had this with Leader games, but it wasn't that strong) that makes me leave the table from time to time and start walking around thinking, genuinely stressed with the situation on the board. Absolute masterpiece - and I haven't even tried the full campaign with turns 17-32 (there are a lot of differences between the first and the second half of the game). I could probably give this game a 10 now, but I try not to give too high ratings and I'm waiting to play the second part of the game sometime and finally the whole campaign. For now, it's the best solitaire game that I've ever played and I can even go as far as to suspect that this won't change until next games in the series come out or until I finally buy and learn Fields of Fire.

Series rating. This just hits the sweet spot the more I play the series. Tells such a moving and poignant story as your men fight, die, and hopefully take real estate.

Mounted map is glorious (As all of them are). Components are great, and the game play is tight. 

Flip book is a must, but makes game play so friggin' simple and easy to focus on the story as it unfolds, not rules minutiae.

The best solitaire wargame ever? Probably, and that is thanks to a very innovative and clever system. It's not easy to win this game but that is just as it should be and it gives the game great replay value. In many solo games there aren't that many decisions and a lot of time is used for the programmed AI-moves and a ridiculous amount of dice rolling. But this isn't the case with this game with its clever use of cards for the AI and a dice less combat system.

I give this a 10, since it might be the best solitaire wargame I've ever played (The Ambush games, also designed by Mr. Butterfield,  were wonderful, but the situations lost a lot in replaying -- the pluses and minuses of being heavily scripted). Card draws ensure every game will have the Germans act randomly after the initial setup. This is such a wonderfully thought out design. One note on the rules: they appear lengthy, which may put some people off -- but as someone who is really picky about clear and complete rules sets, take it from me, the rules to this game are an absolute model of clarity and completeness. The game is much simpler to play than one would think. I also love the history in the game -- I'm no novice to the Normandy invasion, nor to Omaha Beach in particular, but I have learned a lot from this game. Another winner from John Butterfield.

Got it off a market website for only 25Euros, and I was pretty pumped about that.  Looks really interesting but being a rather long game I may need a nice quiet Sunday afternoon to play it, but those are hard to come by.

Got to play thefirst six turns, and so far am impressed.  Seems best a game learned by doing and less from reading.

Oct '17:  played the intro scenario, all 16 turns.  Lost with 4 points, but only six losses, so respectable.  This is quite a good game, amazing it that it uses no dice but enough variation brought by the cards you are really nor sure what will happen in any given offense.  Someday I need to play the full 32 turns on both fronts, and bite the six to eight hour bullet.

I preordered the game after seeing the prototype at BGG.CON '07. D-Day at Omaha Beach is an impressive looking package which includes a beautifully illustrated, full-color historical booklet on the battle.  If it plays as good as it looks, then it will be a keeper.

Update: I finished my first game and lost due to catastrophic losses of the 29th Infanrty Division on turn 10. (Meanwhile, the Big Red One was kicking ass!).  This game is a lot of fun and has good replay value.  The rules and charts are clear, easy to understand, and the game's mechanics are innovative. I'm sure wargame designers will borrow from this design. Game 2: This game is tense and addictive!  I ended up playing until 3AM because I kept wanting to play "just one more turn."

Verdit: Tense, fun & addictive.  My favorite solitaire game.

I should not have bought this game. I thought that I would have liked to play a game especially designed for solitaire play. The problem is that almost any time I push myself to buy a wargame it is because I have forgotten the last time  I had tried and then not played the last acquired wargame more than once. The real fact is that I don't like any more that the bookkeeping requires more energy than the creative deep choices I search in games (there are exceptions, there are wargames that I do like, notably Maria, but because they are "different").

So after one play I don't want to play it again. If I strictly adhered to the meaning of the ratings here on BGG (oriented to subjective "want-to-play" instead of "how good-is-the game-for-its-genre"), I should have rated it lower. But this would have not been fair: this game is good in its genre, just it is not my cup of tea. So I try a middle approach for my rating. For people that like wargames and solitary wargames: this is a good game, one of the best solitary wargames. But for people that like me prefer  to use most of their mental energy on significant choices and not on bookkeeping... probably better avoid it.

I may try to play it again if in some future I don't find people to play with.

Peleliu is a very good game, but can be very frustrating as you can't really react to what the AI throws at you. Omaha Beach seems to have a better decision making built in and hits a sweet spot between complexity and fun.

One of the best - if not the best - solo games I've played. The key is that you actually feel like you're playing a wargame - forming plans, executing them, and as often as not scrambling to rescue something from said plans' failure. Yes, this game is hard. But certainly winnable. And after each attempt you'll feel like you've learned something that'll help you next time.
And beyond this design's playability it really works as a thought-provoking work of art, too. You'll come to appreciate just how horrendous this battle was for all concerned, and what these men, American and German, had to go through.

Nice counters, gorgeous map (I don't mind paper maps). The rule book is well written and answers most questions I have had so far.

Procedural, mechanical and ponderous.

I'm happy to accept that this is an excellent and innovative game, but it's not a game that suits my preferences. I prefer games like Paths of Glory that feel more like a game and less clockwork.

This is complex ( as for euro gamer) war game. First approach  and turns are biased by constant rulebook flipping and mistakes. But once you get a grip of basic rules and connections you discover the beautifully designed, rich historical war game. This is the ultimate solo experience since you really feel that game is playing against you. There are no dice ( which is good). This game is hard - as solo game should be!

A first foray into real wargames and it proved to be a real eye-opener. I've absolutely loved this game. The system is so elegant and I have great admiration for the way in which the designer has incorporated historical events into the gameplay. Games are immersive, tense, agonising and epic and contain moments of real elation (and quite a lot of despair). Although I was tempted to rate this a 10 I had to deduct a point because some games turn out to be completely unwinnable if events are unfavourable. Although this makes for a sobering reflection on D-Day itself, it doesn't produce the best playing experience. Still, the game is so good that I will happily just set it all up again and start over.

Here are my thoughts after playing four separate games with different scenarios over nearly 21 days

[b]What I Like[/b] - [i]This will be a long list and in no particular order.[/i]

:d10-1: [b]The map.[/b] It's outright brilliant, novel, and completely appropriate for this game. Everything on the map has a specific purpose. There's no fluff. And while it is extremely utilitarian, at the same time it manages to look aesthetically pleasing. It may look busy at first, but once you understand its construction, the map is easy to comprehend and in an efficient way to convey information and support your planning.

:d10-2: [b]The terrain.[/b] I have never been more fixated on the terrain during a game as a challenge in itself. The terrain governs so much in this game: maneuver, cover from enemy fire, combat resolution, etc. In the progression from low tide beach, up to the shingle then up the bluffs or through the pavilion draws to the high ground, the three dimensional nature of the battlefield is represented extremely well in gameplay terms on a two dimensional map. One of the things I appreciate most about this game is the influence the terrain has on everything. When playing, I find myself constantly studying it to discern some weakness in the enemy line or previously unrealized route my troops could utilize.

:d10-3: [b]The combat resolution.[/b] Unit strength, control of terrain, weapons, and tactics affect combat. Randomness and uncertainty are introduced through German unit and depth counters. As they are randomly placed upside down, you won't determine their strength until your forces probe and attack. Combat is simple to understand and resolve. On top of that, as your units take losses, they lose random weapons. This forces the player to adapt as you will often need to maneuver units that have what you need from one area to another once you determine the type of resistance you face. All in all, I think the combat system is clever, yet offers an easy way to inject weapons, strength, tactics, and terrain into system.

:d10-4: [b]The tactical considerations.[/b] The player has limited actions. How do I use them? Barrage a WN in hopes I can give my troops time to advance without taking heavy fire? Move up the tanks and other non-infantry units so they aren't lost when the tide rises? Attack - when and where? With who? Often times I will be capable of attacking more German positions than I have actions for; not to mention troops on the beach that need to be moved up. Should I preservation move some units through intense German fire or use a precious action so they can skirt around the most deadly areas? If the player is planning for the extended game, he's also got to have a mind for the future. Where is German resistance stacking up? Where is the terrain to my advantage? Is there a hole I can push through to try and envelope the Germans? The extended game brings a load of new considerations and challenges. German reinforcements act unexpectedly and are capable of using new tactics and weapons against you. They may use mortars, ambush your units, advance from one position to another, reinforce, redeploy, etc. Where are my concentrations of strong troops and leaders and where are they located compared to the enemy's strong and weak spots? How will I plan to minimze my exposure to their capabilities while reducing their capacity to inflict harm upon me. The tactical considerations are deep because a host of previously mentioned game elements combine to offer the player what I think is an amazing amount of depth. There are some many things you [i]can[/i] do, but you will only be able to actually do some of them. This is perhaps my favorite part of the game; I've spent a lot of time lost in analysis gauging risk versus benefit, knowns versus unknowns.

:d10-5: [b]The mechanics.[/b] Everything you need to know is determined by the known elements on the map, quasi-known enemy dispositions and strengths, and the completely random card draws. One deck of (I think 54) cards determines landing success, mine explosions, German artillery attacks, random events, and German attacks and actions. It's concise, sensible, and a pleasure to use. I find the mechanics, whether American unit movement, combat, special event resolution, German attacks, etc. are very well integrated, make sense, and heighten the experience. There's luck, but there  are no dice.

:d10-6: [b]The rules.[/b] I regard the rules as very well written and organized well. I've had very few questions that were not actually discussed within the rulebook. It just takes a finer parsing of the text or someone on BGG to point you in the right direction to understand a few concepts you may initially miss. I think this is one of the more well written rulebooks in my mind from a functional perspective. I rate this game medium-heavy complexity. That's in relation to the other games I'm familiar with. The reason I went with medium-heavy over medium is not because of the character of the rules, but because of the depth of gameplay I feel is present.

:d10-7: [b]The player aids.[/b] The game comes with some black and white charts/tables as well as a full color section with a few examples of play. All are functional and fullfil their intentions.

:d10-8: [b]The counters.[/b] They are functional and easy to use. The font is just right for me and the other information (steps, control capability, entrance turn, weapons, attack strength) is easy to decipher and understand.

:d10-9: [b]The challenge.[/b] This game is very challenging. Very tense. It tempts me each turn to play just one more because I feel like I'm walking the wire to success; just in reach but so easy to fall off the side. I've only played five games thus far, but I feel like I have to play my absolute best in order to have a chance to succeed. Which I really haven't done yet. This is a tough game; it makes you earn it. I had the opportunity to move into the extended game once. The German takes on an entirely different, and more deadly character at that point. [b]I was struck by the impression that I was playing against an intelligent opponent who was still weighed down by uncertainty and imperfect information.[/b] When the Germans redeploy a unit that then leaves a gap in the line you can take advantage of or occasionally happen to concentrate their reinforcements away from a concentration of U.S. strength you'll see what I mean. The AI is tough and unforgiving. But it feels more like an intelligent person than any other AI I've played against.

:d10-1: :d10-0: [b]The leaders.[/b] I enjoy how leadership is modeled. Heroes, Generals, and Headquarters all have different capabilities. You need them to win but you also need to use them correctly. They're not superheroes. You're not guaranteed to win just because you have them.

:d10-1: :d10-1: [b]The history.[/b] As much as a game can, I feel like this game tries to stay as true to the subject as possible while still offering the player a challenging [i]game[/i]. I love history and it is games like D-Day at Omaha Beach that inspire me to read more about the subject they attempt to depict. This is another measure of success where this game rates highly.

:d10-1: :d10-2: [b]The longevity.[/b] I've only played five games. Yet I keep wanting to come back for more. But wait, you say. There's only one map and it does not have a modular ability nor any terrain hexes that can be used to vary the geography. Yes, you're correct. But I've witnessed each game play out differently so far. And I look to session reports on BGG and see other players have games that look nothing like mine. There's a lot of randomness in this game that keeps it looking fresh. But it is randomness laced heavily with a deterministic and thoughtful intelligence. On top of that, there are multiple what-if scenarios. I played one and right away you're playing a different game with new benefits but also new challenges. I think this game offers a lot of replayability.

[b]Minor quibbles[/b]

:d10-1: [b]Heroes.[/b] Thus far, I think success depends upon having enough heroes in addition to wise tactical play. You need both. Unfortunately, the entrance of Heroes is entirely dependent on event cards, which are random. I've had games when I received enough Heroes to feel like I had a chance to win. I've had some where I just don't draw them and feel ever more doomed as the game wears on. For a game that requires so much time and takes such a toll with the tension it generates, I have become slightly irked at the completely random nature of Hero generation. I would still like some randomness associated with how many are generated, when they enter, and even where they may be placed. But I want to know that I'm guaranteed to get at least 2-3 Heroes over the course of a game. In the basic game I have 15 chances in which to draw Heroes. In the extended game I have a total of 30 chances. I don't know what the frequency of Hero events are in the card deck, nor will I game the system and look. I just want a guarantee along with some variability. Success depends too heavily upon their presence to rely upon their presence being determined completely randomly.

[b]Who should think carefully about buying this game?[/b]

:d10-1: [b]Those who don't like too much challenge or who need to win most of the time.[/b] This game is not easy on you. And it's not easy on your mind. It's very tense. In fact, the only reason why I wanted to give it a break after my last game (in addition to trying some new games) is that my mind needed respite from the tension and stress.

:d10-2: [b]Those who aren't interested in the history.[/b] You might enjoy it even if you're not interested. But D-Day tries really hard to be both a simulation and a game. I think it does well, but you may not be that interested in the history and simulation side.

:d10-3: [b]Those who demand the best quality components.[/b] I have no problem with the components. They're standard war game components. Nice looking enough and functional. Especially the map. But if you want extra large and chunky counters, be warned. They are on the smaller end. They are also harder to punch cleanly from the sprues. My first printing wasn't so bad, but I hear the second printing was not as good of quality. I don't think the components are bad by any means, but they're not high quality. I call them of serviceable quality and I'm happy with them.

:d10-4: [b]Those who don't have much space or much time.[/b] You can finish the basic game in a few hours once you have a good understanding of the rules. The extended game is much longer. I have been able to start and finish the basic game over several evenings during the work week. The extended game has taken the better part of a week at the same rate. You also need the space (it's not a huge game, but it will demand your dinner table or a large desk.

[b]Who will like this game?[/b]

Well, if you find that you're not described in the [b]Who should think carefully about buying this game?[/b] section and like what you read in the [b]What I Like[/b] section, you should probably buy this game. I mean it. If you are drawn to the historical period, challenging games, an engrossing theme, analytical though, don't mind some randomness, and have the time and space, this may be the game for you.

I've played more of this game for a sustained longer period of time at once than I have with any of my other games. D-Day at Omaha Beach has made it to the top, or right near the top, of my game collection. This is a keeper for me, and one I hope to play much more of.

Great solitaire game! The extended game is a blast!! 
The big problem I see is that luck can really destroy your game, which is quite annoying if you are playing 4-12h.
I like FoF better because you seem more in control (at least a card doesn't destroy your chances of a win... besides those nasty counterattacks in your last turn). 
Still, this seems to fall into the design philosophy that sees difficulty in a solitaire game as just a ratio of wins vs. number of loses and stacks the cards accordingly (much like VPG games). This is a philosophy I don't like AT ALL, it's akin to cheating. I want a game that it's hard to win because it's hard to play/master, not because, statistically, I can only win 1 out of 6 times (you could just roll a die and have it faster then).
That I still play this (11 times until now, that's something like 44h!!) is nonetheless a tribute to a great game, despise the random flaws.

This game is a perfect fit.  A solitaire game that is difficult to win with good decision making.  Oh and it happens to be about a topic that is at the top of the list of my favorite moments in history to study.

It plays really well, the solo game engine just works for this battle.  Way too early to tell if it will hold my interest after a lot of plays.  Does not matter, if I play it every June 6th then its good enough for me.

Rating is based on game design and playability.  Its not difficult to learn and has good decision making with a solid fog of war / AI to it.  The map is busy and ugly but functional so I will not knock it.  Also not really sure the replay value but that is not the fault of the design.

Update:
I like the game, but never found time to get it on the table and could not turn down a trade offer that included this title.  I don't miss it so my final rating reflects the end result.

Lauded by many to be another John Butterfield masterpiece, I was distinctly underwhelmed by my experience. True to other comments, the gameplay is extremely difficult, often ending in a catastrophic loss without even being able to leave the beach. The losses required to lose the game seem far too low for the casualties the Allies did sustain in Operation Overlord, so one wonders why after taking less casualties the Omaha Beach landing would be considered a failure.

The greatest problem with the [b]D–Day[/b] series is that progress is mostly scripted by the deck. There are few interesting decision points and it's mostly just luck of the draw when assembling the tactical requirements to breach a strong point, hoping the enemy field of fire doesn't randomly take out a unit with a required weapons type.

Another winner from John Butterfield I knew it would be good after my experiences with RAF so I pledged for it when I first saw it. My only gripe is the map and terrain chart. The hex line features looked blurred to me. ImHO GMT would have made a better map. The terrain chart could have been better. The bluff example was no well defined, it looked brown. Counters were well done. The cards seemed a bit flimsy. I put them in card sleeves. Game A+, a challenge to play. I expect it will become a solitaire wargame classic like Ambush.

Wow! Early review from playing a few sessions of Easy Fox. This is like a fine piece of software -- a simple, elegant game mechanic w/ a lot of intelligence churning away under the covers. 

I've read Balkoski's book on the topic (highly recommended) and this game captures the scope of the day's events. The thought and consideration that went into this game is really impressive. 

The map is an achievement in information design. Gameplay feels "genius" in an explicitly designed way. That is, little about the pleasures of the game feel accidental. 

I'm normally not a big hex-and-counter wargame player, but this game sets the bar pretty high. I consider myself fortunate to have it and will strongly consider other Butterfield titles for my collection.

My first dedicated solitaire game.  Not really sure what to think about it.  While the system is cool in its concept, it's kind of fiddly, and I don't know that the gameplay will convince me to play it enough to learn the rules well.  I also think the "event" card draw is a big swing.  If the Americans draw a Hero event early on, it can make a huge difference.

Also, what a hideous board!

Nice game system.  No dice!  Excellent rules and components.  What a well-designed, well-thought-out, well-engineered, well-balanced, well-tested and well-proofread game!  Sets a standard for war game quality.  Excellent historical material and definitely a realistic "feel like you are there" quality.  Nice variety of scenarios and play modes.  Quick set-up.  2 very minor issues: (1) can't see numbers on HQ/Eng track (but can if position markers a bit low); (2) I wish there was an easy way to verify that all units are present at set-up (e.g. put on turn track).

A remarkably innovative and fun design that is also very addicting.

The map seems really weird at first, but upon playing it works like a charm and saves the player a LOT of aggravation in checking fields of fire and terrain features. 

Top-notch rulebook, but there are a many nuances and it will take some experience to learn the system and to get things right.

Be forewarned, the game is VERY tough on the player.

Overall, an excellent item...and I'd love to see more games in the series! (see S&T 265 for a follow-up game on Dieppe that uses chits, not cards).

RATING: 10
This is the most addictive wargame I've purchased in a long time.  It's one of those games where you know you need to get to bed but keep saying to yourself "just one more turn"!

So far I've played the "First Wave" scenario 4 times, scoring 23 VPs on my first try (so I thought it was easy!), then 6 VPs, 7 VPs, and 18 VPs.  Each game is different due to the "events" and different German positions firing each turn.

I'm currently on my first play through of the campaign and I'm finding it very challenging.  Battling through the bocage takes a lot more care and coordination of your forces in order to take out German positions.  I'm pretty sure I'm well on my way to losing on my first campaign attempt but am looking forward to a restart in a day or two.

I cannot recommend this game enough to anyone with an interest in D-Day or solitaire games.

More thoughtful, tense, and enjoyable homework from game designer John H. Butterfield comes in the form of D-Day at Omaha Beach. 
The scale--in terms of moving parts--is really big for this WWII hex encounter. Often turns bring about consideration of 25 protagonists who have a wide variety of actions and a comparable number of antagonists...that is if your fellas even make it from the ocean to the beach in one piece.
There's a lot of thinking here every turn, but mental exertions do not diminish the feelings of hopelessness that beset the player at the onset of every German attack nor do they hamper the thrill of finally doing any substantial damage to the better positioned and relentless foes. 
This wargame is fun, infuriating, ingenious, and educational. And the SUPERB rulebook makes this complex game far easier to comprehend than some of its simpler peers. 
Bravo, Butterfield.

I like this game but some time ago i valued it higher. Unfortunately, once you know the rules and know, how to play, it`s difficulty comes from randomness and there is nothing to omit it at certain level of experience. In effect, game becomes bit boring. I still appreciate the number of historical details applied into the rules. Good game for hermits - for some time...

Temporary rating, consider it a "love at first sight" score. I've only played a couple of turns so far, and so far the game is gorgeous, the maps looks busy at first but makes absolute sense just after a short while. The AI is very very "evil" and unforgiving (good for me, it adds longevity) and even the events do not seem "game-y" at all.
We'll see...

This fine game from one of my favorite designers of the previous century delivers smooth play, high quality components (including a wonderfully functional map) and a solo challenge that should last through many replays.

My first 10 rating for a game.  While gaming against an opponent has always been fun and rewarding, let's face it, it's so much more convenient to play solitaire.  So I have played plenty of games solitaire, and I have played a few solitaire games.  But now I have DDAOB.  What a fun, challenging, informative game!  Two plays so far - both losses. 

Later lowered to 9.  Still great though!

Comments based off of the introductory scenario - system is definitely unforgiving.

I lost on turn 10.  One concern I do have is how much choice is there. I.e are you playing the game and making decisions or is the system forcing you into obvious choices.

Played 2 more times with the full landing scenarios - seeing the choices and upped rating  Also - looked up and 4 hours had passed - good sign for enjoyment.

Brutal. Got completely chewed up in the Easy Fox scenario on my first play, but I love the mechanics.  Fantastic immersion and incredibly tense.

Beat Easy Fox on the second go-round, (after a few false starts and extensive rules consultations) and now I'm prepping for the bigger scenarios.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Challenging and hard to beat as a solitaire game should be. The gameplay is extremely smooth and immersive. Playing against the German AI feels like playing against another player. This game is a must have for any solitaire wargamer. A masterpiece, and truly one of the best solitaire games ever made. Designed by the brilliant John H. Butterfield.

This was out of print and apparently only available in a ziplock format.  One day, I happened to check the DG site and they had it listed.  Apparently, they had inventoried the warehouse for taxes and found a few more boxes.  My order was placed immediately.  Glad to have it.  It may get reprinted, but it is a cool WW2 Normandy sim that can be played with 1 or 2 players (2 players vs. the AI, not head to head).

Simply brilliant. From the chaos of the early landing to formulating some form of battle plan this game does a fantastic job of simulating it's subject.

A beautifully illustrated and clear map and tough decisions throughout. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
Great game.  Very tense and always tells a great story.  Solitaire is a great choice for this situation.  My only reservation is that it is a little too chess-like at times, and you can really do a lot of factor counting.  Certain situations can be readily seen to be a sure thing, or not at all possible.  Which tends to make it feel less believable and a little sterile at times.  But all in all, a fabulous treatment.

Excellent solo design. Engrossing from the get go... and hard to beat. Lots of replayability here and depth. It has that 'serious war game' feel without the rules complexity often required of such a title. You can have this set up out of the box and be playing in a very reasonable amount of time. If you are a solo gamer and into WWII this is a must have for your collection. Note: it is a rather large game with a significant footprint and a moderate counter density and you may want to keep it set up for two days depending on the amount of time you can devote to a game... so keep that in mind.

Alright, I have finally played the game. Firstly, the game absolutely needs a counter tray. Secondly, it's too long for what it is. Thirdly, too much of a luck-fest for me, especially with it being such an involved game. I just had no fun playing this game, it felt like it played itself. I'm a fan of solitaire games, a WWII history buff and have visited Omaha Beach, but this one left me cold.

Cool game! Not too hard (New note: Easy!) to learn and play, but tough to beat! Great! Note: chits are the old thin wargame style. Careful punching, cutting out, and corner clipping, is need. But, definitely worth the time and work to do! Only two sheets of chits! :)

I have played 3 games in this series and this one is easily my favorite.  I like the unique mechanics of the series.  I think this one had the most interesting invasion aspect and I liked all the different stages of storming the beach, climbing the bluffs, and taking over the draws.

Played more than 10 times in a little over a month.This is a true masterpiece of what an artificial opponent should be. Requires adapting each time to how the battle unfolds and where to concentrate your effort to break through. It does not get a 10 because, sometimes, no matter how desperately you try, luck can totally screw up your game to a point where you will never be able to win (10 events in a row that call for reinforcements/depthmarkers to be placed and no hero leave you with no hope). It does drag you back to the board everytime, though!

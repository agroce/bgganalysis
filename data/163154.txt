I cannot imagine the COIN Series getting any better than Falling Sky. Massively interactive even for the solo player. Themed to the extreme, clever, competitive, and fresh.

Falling Sky is not a generic offering. Simply put, it’s smart: an experience continuously in motion.

A classic GMT COIN game set during Caesar's reconquest of Gaul. A tight and gnarly game from the off. Great asymmetric play and victory conditions. A great 4 player strategy game.

I played another game from the COIN series, Cuba Libre. I like this kind of game, but I feel completely lost in what to do exactly, it is a complex game and it is difficult to understand. It is not a bad thing, since it is expected. The game itself is great with theme and interaction. I like Falling Sky slightly more than Cuba Libre because of the theme.

Rating based on doing the play-through and one interrupted solo game.  I'm beginning to grasp the mechanics, but only have a vague idea of strategy.  With so little information I would usually hesitate to rate, but I think a 6 is accurate in this case.  I'm not lying awake at night thinking of strategy (the mark of a 9/10 game IMO), but I do want to play again and give this a chance to grow on me.  So...slightly north of ambivalent ... 6 ... and aware I haven't really given it a fair outing yet.

This is a good game. Maybe it has a few problems that would turn it into a great one with a solid 8 or even 9. For me it is around 7,5 now, but I'll rather give it 0,5 more than less.
First problem is that it is a GMT game. Which means that for me personally that is great, they will make great systems, great games and what not. But for majority of people it will not be accessible, so let us say that is a "problem". Second problem it has are the components of GMT, they work but they wont exactly dazzle you and for 8 score games you kind of want that too. So now we come down to number 3. And that is that it is mostly for 3-4 players, preferably 4 because that auto piloting only is ok for the germans any more and it feels a bit tedious and less tactical. So with 4 players imo a great game 8 points if not a 7,5

I thoroughly enjoy the COIN series and I am a huge Roman history buff, but this volume falls flat for me.  For me personally, it does not have the ebb and flow of the other titles and seems to focus too much on being a simulation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game that suffers from typical COIN problems:
 - You're mostly dependent on reasonable play of the other players
 - Winning is too random, because a good board position is only allows winning and card draw / opponent randomness will decide a great amount of the final outcome
 - It's too long

In comparison to: FitL. It's more straight forward and has an interesting leader mechanic, but the factions are less interesting.

I played through the Playbook (which is essentially a tutorial script to follow which teaches you the game), and while it wasn't really playing the game is some senses, I'm counting it nonetheless!

Wow, what a sprawling game. You have a military campaign to execute and factional goals you need to achieve in order to claim victory, but you need to manage your regions, economy and many more things with an eye to being able to support your efforts through the long game. There are many interlocking little cogs, and while the game is simple enough, the implications of your range of choices echo through the board and shake what the other players are planning and doing. A great game. Can't wait to play 'properly'.

Decided I'm not a fan of this after all. The Romans are just too tricky to play, and the Averni victory levels are weird and far too dependent of Roman play style (if the Romans play conservatively, rarely exposing their forces, the Averni basically can't win and can't even make progress towards their victory).

Moreso than most COIN games, this really feels absolutely nothing like the historical events. It's all about taking a chance on card timing and playing whack-a-mole. The Romans face few logistical problems so they just keep their legionary hammer intact and wander around beating on Gauls making relatively little progress towards their (basically impossible) goals and the Gauls try to avoid drawing anyone's attention. Plus we have the by now standard bizarrely predictable combat system and egregiously overlong playing time. This is a 3 hour game that runs 6 at the minimum. Play the short version of the medium game if you must; regular medium and long games are outrageously long (6-10hr) for how incredibly repetitive and frustrating they are.

I can see this might be fun if you can play it exactly the same way the designer's play group does, but wow, that seems like a *very* narrow band, and it really does not tolerate variance well. It's also very much at the mercy of interesting cards coming out in an interesting order - something the design does nothing to ensure, and in fact seems to work against.

So despite appearances, this does little to drag COIN out of mediocrity. I still rate Fire in the Lake as the one and only more or less tolerable COIN. This is better than the more disastrous entries in the series (Liberty or Death, Andean Abyss), but I'd still avoid it.
---
My opinion of this has improved. Definitely play the short version of the medium game, which seems to be the sweet spot - doesn't take forever and everyone is in it. Keep an eye on the Aedui, whose victory levels are fairly low and their Subvert special action is quite strong (make sure you're playing it right, the wording isn't crystal clear). They're the "money" faction, which means they're dangerous. The Arverni need a long game to win it seems like, but they need to be careful to launch spoiling attacks to make sure the other Gallic factions - particularly the Aedui - are kept at bay while they build up. The Romans seem to be in a very tough spot. Their victory conditions are very steep, and if they don't keep their score up the Senate takes away legions, and then they're screwed. I think you need to bide your time, playing a delaying game, until you can get the Senate into Adulation and then bring down the hammer. But I don't know. The other factions seem like they can get close, but I don't know how the Romans do it, other than to make sure you keep the other factions at each other's throats. If the Celts decide to show some national solidarity, you're pretty doomed. Make sure the Arverni are keeping the Aedui down while you focus on the Belgae.
---
One play. Generally positive impressions, but the Senate tracks gives me serious pause. It's a death spiral; if you start losing, the Senate will take away your legions, which means you continue to lose, and lose harder, which means ... this is a pretty terrible mechanic. Also a bit worried about the Arverni victory conditions, which rely on getting Roman legions off the board, which may simply be impossible if the Romans are playing conservatively with their legions (if, for example, they've lost enough legions that they can't be particularly effective, but not enough for the Arverni to actually win).

So ... I still have hope for this one, and will play it again. But stuff in there makes me pretty nervous.

It's also pretty long, longer than Fire in the Sky. Anything other than the short scenario seems way too long. The short scenario is 3 winters, and seems like about 5 hours, maybe a little less if you can really turn the screws. That makes the bigger scenarios 6-9 hours, which is a bit nuts for COIN.

I think this one may have become my favorite COIN game (FitL is very close though).

Update: After more plays, I think that this is the best COIN game so far.  Clearly a lot was learned from previous games in the series!  The rules appear simple, but the gameplay is richly complex, and you can never really trust anyone else.  None of our games have occurred in the same way.

Of all the COIN games I have played, this one I like the most.  This one feels more "wargame" than the others, and seems to just work better than than Fire in the Lake (too long, big) and Liberty or Death (the mess that combat is kills that one for me).

I'd need to play this again- there's some frustration with how the leaders work and not being able to really counter Rome's mighty force. I could see that you'd find a strategy around this however. Understanding the rules more clearly also helps- there are more dynamic movements being able to do a special action mid movement. Reading more of the playbook will give me a better idea of what sort of actions are possible.

I have played and owned 4 COIN games, but have only kept Fire In The Lake.  Falling Sky for me is by far the best COIN game, and now my favorite game I own. Everything that I have not liked about previous COIN games has been eliminated, and things I have desired to see such as more movement and combat elements have been implemented.  This game is soooo good, with such a deep layering of strategy and tactics that defies the relatively simple rule set.  I love this game.

This sits next to Fire in the Lake as my favourites of the series, less focus on resources more map manoeuvre. It also probably has the most interesting factions across the board, even the Aedui have some pretty good tricks up their sleeves.

---------------
Might be longer than other Coin games, but other than that it seems pretty sound. The Aedui seem a little more interesting that the warlords/drug cartel faction in the other games and having the Germans invade is a great addition.

JAN/17 - COIN games may bear some similarity to each other, but the historical background undergirding new topographies, events, winning conditions, roles, and operations really change up how the story feels to me. Even Falling Sky - the only COIN I rate an 8 because of my lack of interest in the subject - has won me over completely as I read the background to the events as I play. FS provides a new way of thinking about hidden warbands, and some other mechanical twists that ensure my enjoyment of yet another game in this series.

JUN/16 - My first ever pre-ordered game. These COIN games sell out so quick, and - after reading the rulebook - I knew I couldn't afford to miss out on this one.

I am new to COIN, but I'm definitely a COIN fanboy.

I don't mind complexity but this game is just so fucking dense. I'm playing it by following flowcharts with no clue where I'm going and how the next step is going to impact the board...not the sign of a great game for me.

Components: great quality, only complai is that a gmt box does not enter in a gmt game
Complex: hard game to master
Weight: heavy
Players: 4
Length: 3 hours for the 1st scenario
Mechanics: choose, choose and choose
Decisions: see above, you have to choose so many things
Opinion: what is this COIN thing? for me is a game where you have to do so tough decisions that you will be thinking in the game for days, and that is something amazing.
The main decision is what to do when you are eligible, and what is eligible? On each turn there is an event card (and you can see the one for the next turn), and the card has a priority order for that turn... in that order you have to choose if you will go for this turn, if you want the event or you prefer to do some actions. But not only this, your choice will determine the choice of the next one, because depending on yours, the next one is a fix option. 
And only 2 players can act in a single turn. So if you act this one, would the next card more interesting for you?
In a nutshell this is a COIN for me.

Now about Falling Sky in particular, the period the game is about is one of my favorites, Rome!! the Glorious Rome!! So Caesar will try to have all Gauls dispersed, Vercingetorix will try to crush the evil Legions, Ambiorix to dominate the country and Aedui to spread all over Gaul. Oh, and Germans, the lovely Germans that, as a bot could destroy all your plans.
All of them will have to help each other, but keep an eye on what they are doing. Not all actions are the same for everybody (although the Commands are the same for the Gauls in Falling Sky).

In conclusion, a hard game to love and enjoy all the time you play it, negotiating with your mates while seek when to betray or position yourself to win

RATING: 9
A great addition to the COIN series. The system adapts flawlessly to the period and the whole affair has a distinct ancients feel to it, although the mechanics are basically the same as in the modern era COIN games. 

Some period-specific additions have been made of course - most notably perhaps the non-player German faction which can be both a resource and a pain in the backside, depending on the situation. 

The components are outstanding, with a beautiful map and nice stuff like separate player boards. Just a great game overall, can't wait to play it more.

Edit: upgraded score to 9 after more plays. This is actually an excellent game in several ways.

My first COIN game! I'm looking to get this to the table soon!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The only game, I rated before actually palaying it (except tutorials and one game alone, playing four players in order to learn). 
I am absolutely thrilled to get a real four player game done. Meanwhile I´ll start with the solo variant. 
What I can say until now, I really love the theme. The mechanics of the comands, available for different the factions, seem to me so well designed and combined that the evolving and unfolding of the game feels really subtle and complex at the same time. In addition to that the COIN mechanism feels really vivid and further adds quite some strategic components to the game. I start to fall in love with this mechanism (it is my first COIN Game I know and own). But well, thats something, I have to experience further, hopefully with a lot of games played soon. Shurely my first fascination will change by time. But this game has a lot to offer, thats for shure.
 
The most points I give the game for the asymetric faction comands/special abilities and win conditions in combination with having this high grade of interaction and complexicity. I was looking for a game like that for quite a while and I really want to discover more games being that asymetrical (not nessecary wargames).  
Tecnically those are the three most interisting aspects of a game for me and makes Falling Sky such a strongly appealing game for me. 
Furthermore the mechanics of both, the coin system (cards and activation mechanism) and the factions (actions and special abilities) feel strongly thematic and I expirienced a lot of euphoric and thrilled moments while playing the  tutorial and the sologame because of this aspect and the gear tooth forming happenings on the board.
The mechanics of the battles seem quite well designed as well. At hte beginning (reading the rulebook) i was not shure about those, but playing the first time it felt really complex and easy at the same time, low on luck but a good strategic preparation is needed, it is not possible to simply overwhelm someone without giving up coverage elsewhere. Anyway I want to play some diferent wargames, to actually be able to compare and qualifiy.

The high quality components and beautiful designed board  and box seem incedible to me. 
 
The time the game takes certainly is a contra in the way  of how easy it is, to bring it on the table together with other players. But if you find or already have your group, I suppose this can get a damn good experience, playing it over and over again. I rather like longer games more than shorter ones, so it does not feel that bad to me and the fact that the high rated solo variant is possible hopefully will get me over the problem playing it not often enough with other players.

Finally I have to say, this is the highest rated game for me so far because it seems to fit strongly with my taste of games by thematic and mechanics.

Very good addition to the COIN canon with a lighter rules overhead than others but still a lot of differentiation between the factions; Romans ('we rule the known world!'); Arverni ('oh no you don't!'); Aedui ('let's talk business'); and the fiercely independent Belgians and their loose-cannon German friends.

Not quite the classic knife-fight-in-a-phone booth that is Cuba Libre, but the factions are still very much in and out of each others' back pockets a lot of the time.

Like all of the COIN games I've played, it feels more tactical than strategic, with a lot of tit-for-tat amongst the Gauls, although when Caesar turns up with a large force he can clear areas pretty quickly. He still needs to be careful of being ambushed, however, especially against Ambiorix who can do at lot of damage with a large group of warbands and an ambush.....

What a fabulous game. Excellent components matched by a great system. Thoroughly enjoyed my solo plays and my first 4 player game was great - everyone was keen to play it again. Surprisingly difficult to pull off the killer moves of command plus special ability as the preceding player will often make choices that block that move.
The card events can have a decisive effect on the game by making dramatic changes just before winter. However players can see events 1 card ahead and can plan accordingly.

Combines the worst of both Ameritrash and Eurogames into the ultimate of tedium.

Dice rolling is everywhere in this game including combat and resolution of event cards. The designers are so concerned with creating a historical reenactment that there are a hundred rules exceptions and special names for everything that guarantees you will be looking up rules again and again and again so that you get that historically-accurate exception to the rules just right. You are also guaranteed to get several rules wrong your first three times playing due to the complexity.

Despite the Ameritrash-style focus on thematic design, the game has none of the charms of Ameritrash: the units are boring wooden blocks, the game board is a simple map, the card art is all inconsistently-sized and colored royalty-free stock photos from wikipedia and google image search, and the player boards are also boring and ugly. So we get a meticulous historical reenactment with ameritrash dice-rolling combined with the lack of artistic attention or aesthetic appeal of the most soulless wooden-cube farming euro. Shoot me.

If those flaws weren't enough, any given player is at the mercy of the random deck of event cards, random turn orders, and the capricious actions of other players; Rome is dominant in this reenactment, so any given gallic player can be beset by rome and utterly helpless if the other two gauls decline to assist him. You have zero control over your fate if Rome decides to "all-in" you early, particularly due to the obscene Risk dice-rolling that is part of combat.

The game rewards card-counting and extensive meta-knowledge, as a player who memorizes the extensive deck of events gains advantage over other players, exactly like Twilight Struggle.

Finally, down-time and game length: I waited at times an hour between turns. We played for 5 hours and only made it to the first of four winters. Admittedly, two the players in our game were slow, AP-prone types, but even with a quick group, there is no reason to remain engaged during other players' turns and due to the forced action-track mechanic and the random event cards, planning your turn in advance is sometimes impossible. During the first 25% of the game I watched the entire first season of The Walking Dead. seriously

I suspect that this niche genre of historical reenactment wargames exist only for those for whom modern, quality game design takes a backseat to a historical simulation. I am definitely not in this niche.

I have played this as the Arverni and the Romans and two-player as the Romans/Aedui. I think this is really a four player game and not a two player game and would likely not play it again with that player count.  I am a Latin teacher and have taught/read Caesar's Gallic wars pretty extensively so I enjoy the subject matter and like seeing the way the major figures have been represented in events on cards.  This is my second foray into the COIN system and I still find the menu of options for each side a little tough to get a handle on since I play infrequently but this particular game was fairly straightforward from a rules perspective.

RATING: 8
COIN system is great for club gaming, which can grabs the attention of four at the same time while the game can be completed in just an afternoon.  The abstractions at strategic level are somewhat too much to my taste but the historical narrative of the game is rich.  You can always learn something from the system about the strategic development of the war in subject.  I have many games of the COIN and it sounds like a bit wear-off now.  So I delay the purchase of this game and the other new one on American Revolution.  However, I am sure I will get them someday because you just can't afford to loose them in your complete COIN collection, can you?

One of the original designer of the series, Brain Train, explained in an interview of C3i magazine (#29) that COIN is not about firepower and maneuver but on an abstraction level about the movement of "kinetic" operations - that things happen in one area would directly or indirectly another close-by or distant area or areas.  That "things" are the historical narratives/ events as dictated/ edited by the designer of what's important and what's not.  If this is the kind of game for you, look no further.

Falling Sky is a COIN game on Ceasar's conquest of Gaul. The subject would stir up many about the game's ability to simulate such campaign. There are allies in Gaul, namely the blue commerce-savy Aedui. The green Arverni with its tribal leader Vercingetorix would certainly pose a major threat to Rome in the west. If Caesar goes north, his legions would meet the Belgic, under the guidance of Ambiorix. Ambiorix might not be well-known among the non-historian but he was actually a war hero, taking one loss (vs. the normal 0.5) if he fights alongside with Belgic war bands. On the other hand, Vercingetorix can force march his men like the Roman legions to the second area and may entreat Gallic tribes rose to rebellion. He can be a horrible headache to Caesar if he is not met at the right time and the right place.

As usual, the sequence of play among the four factions is determined by the first two faction icons on a playing card. If the factions are "eligible", they can activate to take a command or play the event on the card. Timing of taking the command or event is therefore a signature decision in any COIN game, as a faction becomes "ineligible" the next card unless it was override by the event. There is no "trump" card like that in Fire in the Lake though. The events on the card are two-folds, with upper and lower event effects favorable to one side or the other. Historically, the Aedui is more allied to the Roman as if the Arverni and Belgic are allied together. Realistically, of course, each factions have their own winning agenda. When you see the allies break up suddenly, make no surprise. The events are generally mild in effect as there might be a few cards in other COIN games which might turn the table. One can learn history about the campaign by simply reading the cards.

Falling Sky is a moderate complexity game, meaning you focus on the big picture rather than the micro-management of the battles. Understandably, the combat system in COIN is streamlined and simplified by counting the no. of warbands (Gallic tribes) or auxiliaries (Romans), which then times 1/2 to inflict losses on the defenders. If you have a legion or leader, they inflict one loss each. If Caesar is present with the legions, they inflict two losses each! Caesar can also force march with his forces to more distant places in a third region. Speaking of missile attacks in the ancient...As Gallic players, you better watch out where Caesar currently is.

I played it three times until now and me and my wife love it. It's our favorite COIN game (I also have Fire in the lake and Liberty or death, both excellent too), maybe partly because I'm a Belgian ;-).
There are more things to care about in this one than in the the two others. 
I still have to play the Aedui and the Romans. We played it only with 2 players. It's probably well better with 4. Belgae and Arveni are good allies but I miss 2 different players for the Aeduis and the Romans.
The special activities "devastation" and "suborn" are really terrible for the opponent.
It's really an excellent game.

I'm a sucker for Roman history.  I'm a sucker for COIN games.  Roman COIN?  Yes.  In addition to the brilliant gameplay (the varied victory goals work quite well in this one) the take on Caesar's conquest of Gaul as an early example of Counter Insurgency leaves the players with much to think about as further studies follow.

I really, really want to rate this higher.  Each of my games fell into a stalemate rather quickly.  No one wanted to make an aggressive move (thus weakening them and another player) and handing the game to another player that could take advantage of the weakened state.  This was exacerbated in the long game as 80% of the game length is in the stalemate phase.  I would rather play Triumph and Tragedy or Maria (admittedly all three player games).

No rating yet, just fooling around in my first solo game, but it certainly seems good. By some miracle this game does have some of the feel of the Gallic war period, even though it retains the bones of the modern COIN designs. Definitely has more of the feel of a military slugfest to me than some of the other games in the series. 

I noticed a couple of points that Chris Farrell brought up - the Roman Senate track, which in theory could be an ugly downward snowball for Rome, and the Arverni victory conditions, which rely on killing Roman legions. Those do seem like potential concerns (particularly the spector of Rome turtling, and making their legions difficult to attack - they are very dangerous to attack even normally). But Volko is a very bright designer/ developer, and the game was playtested by smart people, so I suspect these may not be issues as players gain experience. I certainly cannot say, I am still trying to process everything in the game. I am enjoying the heck out of it so far, as I have pretty much every COIN game. In fact, I received the reprint of A Distant Plain in the same delivery, and I'm desperate to try it, but I haven't even set it up yet because of Falling Sky. I really want to play them both equally.

3/'17: Got it out for a first run, playing a solo game as the Romans.  Took me three hours to get through ten cards and one scoring round but am getting the hang of the bot cards.  Enjoying the game quite a bit: Caesar is really important to Rome!  As with many of the other COIN games, takes some time to figure out what you should be doing to advance towards winning.  The board surprisingly small!  Also, it seems like I got some extra wooden bits, or I'm missing something.  Also, the importance of hidden and unhidden units not as clear to me in this game as others in the series.

December 2017: My first honest-to-goodness play of this title, albeit solo.  Played the 30 card version of the 52 BC scenario.   I decided to not use the bots and make all decisions to try and learn the game a bit. Overwhelming at first, and the second half I maybe ran through it a bit fast. Really would like to try this with more players: I think two might be enough, actually. Not sure I played very well, but I think I understand the actions well enough.

IS this my least favourite of the COIN games so far? It might well be. That doesn't make it a bad game, it's a good game, but if I'm playing COIN I'd rather play something else.

Very curious on this one. I can see this moving away from previous COIN  conceptions of asymmetrical warfare towards a more battle oriented game, but I may be wrong.

From what is clear by now already is that GMT chose a very interesting painting by Thomas Cole for the cover image that is TOTALLY disconnected from the game's setting and theme, it's too dark and the detail form the original seems arbitrarily cropped to me, it still looks refreshing and unconventional.

Just got this last night. The Romans are dealing with three (well, four if you include the Germanic war bands) factions that have varying degrees of loyalty to one another. I've played all of the COIN games except A Distant Plain and this one looks easier that the others but I won't know that for sure until I play it (which I hope is soon).

I loved Cuba Libre, liked Andean Abyss and was disappointed with Fire in the Lake (primarily due to time requirements and complexities of the system), so I'm interested in seeing where this falls in my preferences concerning COIN games.

The horrible choice in cover art by an American landscape artist depicting Native Americans is apparently [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/image/2963551/falling-sky-gallic-revolt-against-caesar?commentid=6258595#comment6258595]the game designer's pretentious allegory of Roman Empire propaganda[/url], how disappointing. Hopefully they choose a more relevant cover with a reprint so I will be able to buy this game. This is the first war game that I had no idea what it was about from the box art and I am far from alone with this assessment:

"[i]I have to say, I'm disappointed. It's very dark, not thematically, but as in hard to make out the details. It's a Native American scene, rather than the countries of Gaul in the Roman era. Looking at the other games in the COIN series, they all seem to have subject matter very relevant to the theme, so this one seems inconsistent/out of place.[/i]" - JohnnyDollar, BGG Forums

"[i]I'm also a naysayer with regards to this cover. As I mentioned on CSW, at least the "hunter-gatherers" in the middle background of the original painting have been Photoshopped out![/i]" - Ian Wakeham, BGG Forums

"[i]I agree, nothing about the visual invokes the topic of the game.[/i]" - Niko, BGG Forums

"[i]To be honest, sometimes I think Roger MacGowan doesn't want the games to sell. Happy to see not another box cover relying on cheesy clip art. Disappointed to see the use of a generic wilderness scene.[/i]" - Mick Mickelsen, BGG Forums

"[i]I agree that this cover is disconnected from the subject of the game, and is bland.[/i]" - Randall Monk, BGG Forums

"[i]Terrible, terrible cover.[/i]" - Shauneroo, BGG Forums

"[i]Agree, really detached subject matter. I'm sure there must be better, more appropriate paintings that could be used.[/i]" - Keiron, BGG Forums

"[i]It's a very nice painting, but as discussed by others here, it's a Native American scene of a hunter chasing a deer, with cropped out teepee's off to the right. I don't feel a connection between this image and the subject matter of the game. I was hoping for something more like Adolph Yvon's painting of Caesar in Gaul.[/i]" - Jason Paterson, BGG Forums

"[i]While this is most definitely a masterwork by an artist on top of his game, it makes no sense in the context of this game.[/i]" - gamesontables, BGG Forums

"[i]Come on GMT, it's a bit late for April Fool's jokes[/i]" - Steffen Beck, BGG Forums

"[i]Just terrible and out of place.[/i]" - L. Schmitt, BGG Forums

"[i]Another huge thumbs down on the cover art. As a piece of art, it's interesting, but too dark to see what the hell it is, but as a game cover about the Romans in Gaul it might as well be, well anything at all. There is no connection to the game. You wouldn't like a chariot on the cover of a French and Indian war game would you?[/i]" - Mike Hoyt, BGG Forums

"[i]One of the most exquisitely AWFUL game box covers I've EVER seen...[/i]" - Chris Nelson, BGG Forums

"[i]Just finished setting up my first game. The game looks awesome. Except that box cover artwork. YUCK. Too dark to even see what it is and not evocative at all of Gaul, Celts, Romans, or anything else the game includes. It certainly won't catch a customer's eye on the shelf, unless they wonder what the dark blob is. Yes, I read the discussion and why GMT felt it was an appropriate choice. IMHO, it was a bad choice.[/i]" - Richard A. Edwards, BGG Forums

This is really difficult to rate. I need to play it a LOT more before things start to flow. It is a very long game, and though the rules aren't necessarily difficult, there is a lot to take in. I am constantly referring to flowcharts and rule book. 
I would like to play it much more though, because it is completely engrossing. Also of course because I would like to start running the bot for at the very least the Roman faction. But the way the bot flowcharts are made you kind of have to know the regular rules fairly well first, unless you want to add an extra layer of looking up this that and the other for every single action.
It is a beautiful game. A bit more focus on fighting than I had anticipated, but I do not find that problematic (except for the fact that I can't seem to be able to get myself to play well for the Romans).

I am never going to LOVE-love COIN, simply because the scales and units involved tend to be so abstracted that it's a bit hard for me to get a srong visual in my head of what's happening beyond those beautiful wooden pieces. Also games that come down to desperate VP grabs always leave me a little deflated in the end.

That said, this is by-far my favorite in the series of the 4 that I have spend any time with. This one clicks for me on a whole bunch of refreshing levels.


It plays quick, nasty and somehow feels a bit more user-friendly than the others I have seen. (I have no played Cuba Libra which is also heralded as a great entry-point to the system)  

This, for me, feels like the true sweet-spot of weighty decisions, linear objectives, and extremely manageable mechanics.. and absolutely gorgeous to look at when all set up.

It’s one of those ones I will get out to play if I feel board. I leave it set up and play a card or two before work  or if I’m cooking. If you have an interest in the COIN series I urge you to try it. At first blush, the rules seem complicated, and I’ve seen and heard people turn them away from the game. It’s somewhat deceptive in that regard. Play a few commands and see just how natural and fluid they are. And yet there is a startiling amount of depth to this game. The interactions between the factions are refreshing for COIN Veterans.  Andrew and Volko have reinvigorated the series with a title that improves on what has come before as well as innovate in new ways as well. Absolute recommend.

RATING: 7.7
[u]The positive[/u]
(+) This game has very few restrictions in how you try to get things done. This empowers the player to achieve game turning results with a single action, sometimes by thinking 'out of the box'. This aspect gives the game an 'epic' feel: around every corner there might be an opportunity for glory or defeat and this keeps players at the edge of their seat during the entire play.

(+) This is a highly asymmetric game in which each player has a different set of victory conditions and abilities. Still, these goals are designed cleverly in order to induce a rich flavor of opportunistic cooperation and intrigue between the different players, which tends to balance the game well, despite its higly asymmetric nature and its tendency for constant game-changing situations.

(+) The battle mechanic feels pretty solid in this title: When well prepared your armies can wreak havoc to your opponents, but there are enough mitigating mechanics to ensure one mighty army can not wipe away another player. Lots of tactics are possible in order to put pressure on a player commanding the biggest army (ambush, supply line, tactical use of leaders, ...).

(+) More than a military game, this is a game of political intrigue and negotiation. The mechanics which tie different fractions together is nothing less than brilliant.

(+) The game engine revolves around a deck of playing cards with each card representing a round and usually an opportunity for 2 players to play an action. The way cards get resolved induces a ton of tactical depth (player order is important, should I act or should I wait for the next card? As a starting player, do you take a strong action, allowing the next player to respond with an equally powerful action?...). This machanic works pretty smoothly and is simple to understand. This is not an easy game, but at least the core mechanics are pretty simple, elegant and straight-forward.

(+) In this game, despite being the 6th instalment of the COIN-series, all with similar core mechanics, the theme does not feel simply 'pasted on'. It is remarkable how the game respects its historic setting. After playing the game, we found ourselves digging up Wikipedia pages learning about different Gallic tribes, cities, historic figures and events - learning about a turbulent piece of history after having simulated it when playing. I can't help but think this game simulates the feelings and motives which must have been felt by the factions concerned when Caesar stepped into this terribly complicated mess of Gallic tribes in order to try to incorporate Gaul into the Roman empire.

(+) High replayability due to different factions, different event cards each time you play, different scenario's incorporated in the rulebook, ... Each game will certainly be different.

(+) The game looks great with a beautiful colorful historic map of Gaul, good quality wooden pieces, ...

[u]The Negative:[/u]
(-) Many players will not appreciate the effort it takes to learn this game. The playbook is a very good starting point in order to learn this game (it works like an extensive example of a few turns explaining different mechanics on the go), but it certainly does not replace the rulebook as not every aspect is brought up in the example in the playbook. The rulebook really is as dry as a piece of legislative text in which every sentence and every word has to be taken very literally. I found the rulebook to be lacking comprehensive examples and honestly, despite having tons of experience in grinding through manuals, this one was a real pain. However, I do appreciate the terrific index in the rulebook, which allows players to quickly find a certain rule while playing. Teaching the game also takes considerable effort. As stated before, the core game engine is pretty simple and straight-forward, the venom lies in the huge amount of exceptions, special cases and special abilities. Because this game thrives by players keeping each other in check using a variety of subtle and not so subtle moves, it is important that each player masters these details before going in. Explaining this game well takes a lot of time.

(-) Playing this game also takes a lot of time. A full game consisting of 3 winter phases (the short variant of the standard scenario), easily gobbles up 8 hours with first time players. This makes it virtually impossible to explain and play the game in one full day and makes it problematic to get this game onto the table. We simple don't have many boardgamefriends willing to invest such a huge amount of time into a single game. The gameflow may also get stalled a little  when players decide where to move their troops or start negotiating. As important changes on the map are made all of the time, it is difficult to prepare for your turn while opponents are still thinking things through.

(-) The game is prone to a serious level of 'frustration', due to a variety of factors. Your game largely depends on what others are doing and more than in classic euro style games, often you need allies. The political aspects of this game and its dynamic unstable nature might lead to some less friendly conversation while playing, know with who you play this game. Also, it is important all players perform at their best in order to keep the game balanced. Some kingmaker-effects are not to be ruled out when the game nears its end and more than one player stands a good chance of winning. The game might sometimes revolve in a pretty unfair way towards a player by the order in which event cards come out and it is up to the players to mitigate this, the game is not designed to balance itself (despite the clear logical choice for turn order on many event cards). I can't help but feel that winning this game involves taking some serious risks, but the price when things turn out wrong can be pretty harsh.

(-) Most eventcards are pretty clear, but some are quite complicated which can slow the game down. The explanation of the cards in the playbook is very poor: unclear formulated sentences are often just repeated there. There is no iconography here, only text, which can be annoying to players sitting at the other side of the table.

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
With only very limited experience with this game and it being my first COIN-title, I can not claim to be an expert in these type of games. As the matter of fact, I have hardly played wargames before. You should read this review as an opinion of a mainly euro-game oriented player towards what is all but a classic euro title!

I like 'Falling Sky' for the fact that the game gives me the feeling of power and seemingly limitless opportunities in order to manipulate the board and the other players, it doesn't feel constrained by a tight rule-set like classic euro-games do. The asymmetric factions involved make for a fascinating game and certainly increase replayablity: each faction plays differently, yet their historic ties are translated into the set-up and mechanics. I feel the designers have made a real effort to make this simulation true to history which adds to the epic scale and feel of this adventure. Despite being a complex beast, the main engine driving this title is skrikingly simple and elegant: playing this game feels nothing like the experience of a bloody chaotic wargame with dices rolling all over the place but actually feels more like playing a supercharged eurogame from which the safeguards have been released. The engine with the eventcards ensures a wealth of tactical and strategic opportunities time after time, and it really feels like every decision matters greatly.

All those reasons would normally lead me to not only liking, but truly loving the game - but unfortunately, there are some aspects which for the time being keep me from claiming I 'love' the game. 'Falling Sky' is not without flaws. My main concern is the tremendous time-investment it takes to learn and play the game. Being an experienced gamer also in the segment of longer games (like for example 1830 and the sorts), this is the first game I have played that felt like it is impossible to bring it to the table with new players, explain and play it in a full day. This is a huge problem as it will keep us from getting this title to the table as often as we would like. I think this game would work best when in a collection of somebody with a gaming group which is committed to play the same game repeatedly in order to master it, not in a collection of someone like me who honestly loves playing all kind of new things with many different friends (most of whom would never commit to such an increadibly long game). Another love/hate-factor I have with Falling Sky is the fact that it seems to bring out the worst in people. Being an increadibly long game, it is hard not to take it seriously (really, would you spend an entire saturday of your adult life investing in learning a rule-set, abilities, definitions, ... and playing a game until late at night and not take this experience seriously, even if it is just a game? :) ). However, despite its game length you and your fellow players need to be able to put things into perspective when things take a bad turn while playing (and believe me, that will happen!). The game is higly dynamic, and though I feel like overall it is remarkably well balanced when all players play it right, situations will arise when players who have lost all hope of achieving anything will get crushed by the course of events even more. The game dynamic works this way: Huge swings happen often and players are being forced to take some serious risks in order to stand a chance of winning with big gains or severe loss for such endeavours. So, I won't call this game unbalanced, because it is admirably balanced, but it requires skill, expertise and a sense of perspective of all players involved in order to make this clock tick.

Is this a good introduction into the COIN-series? I can't compare this title to the other titles in the series, but given the fact that 'Falling Sky' was my first COIN-game, I would say it certainly is possible to enter the series with this title. The game flow is structured and there are mutually beneficial advantages when the Romains cooperate with the Aedui (red and blue) and the Belgae with the Averni (yellow and green). The dynamic of all the factions is also quite straight forward (Rome needs to remove disks from other players, Averni want to place as many disks as possible and kill of enough legions - ensuring that there is a fixed rivalry between the Romans and the Averni. The other players are kind of caught in this big conflict, but initially there is a natural tendency to cooperate, each with another opponent. There is a great sense of which goals each player should pursue from the get go, and while this dynamic may change during the course of the game, by then players will probably have the hang of it. For that reason, I think it would be safe to say that those who show intrest in getting to know COIN might take there first steps into the series with 'Falling Sky'.

Bottomline: I have a huge respect for the designers to have put forward such a rich and historic game which give players a genuin feel of being in the seat of the leaders of the main factions who have played a role in the Gallic revolt against Caesar. It is amazing how such an asymmetric game full of extreme twists remains balanced. It however requires the right players to survive this adventure in a comfortable manner. If the game length and the many exceptions don't scare you off, there is a wonderfully deep strategic military, but mainly political experience to be had in this game!

[u]Volko's tips for teaching the game to new players:[/u]
Here is a tip for teaching the game and getting going quickly:
Don't spend much time explaining. Instead get the new players rolling fast so that they can learn by exploring, even if it's bumbling through.

- First, tell them who they are and what their faction is trying to do.

- Second, tell them what they are looking at--what are the pieces and map symbols.

- Then introduce them briefly to the Faction foldouts.

- Next play a few cards allowing Commands (and Limited Commands) only. Use the normal Sequence of Play mechanic and the cylinders on the Sequence track, but no Special Abilities, no Event play, and no Passing allowed. This will get them familiar with the left side is their menu of Commands, without Al the overwhelming choices.

- Finally, when they seem ready, continue the game adding in Events, Special Abilities, and passing.

Try it and see. I would expect a satisfying game even with new players in a single sitting.

RATING: 6
I enjoy COIN games and own every iteration except Andean Abyss. I am also a big fan of Ancient Rome and really want to like this game for the historical era it depicts. However, I would rate this as my clear least favorite of the five COIN games I own, despite liking the period. There's no real sense of why the designers chose the specific Gallic factions they did and not others (other than the Arverni, a natural counterpart to Rome). I read their explanation in the playbook, but it still doesn't make sense to me. The implementation of the Germans does not feel well fleshed out, as they act independently only a scant few times a game, and the restrictions on Special Activity locations limit their usefulness to the Belgae as well. Additionally, the lack of a Support/Opposition mechanic moves FS too far from COIN for my tastes, and the Gallic factions don't behave much like "insurgents" (more like barbarian armies). Some rules with supply lines being dependent on other factions' "permission" make the game tougher to play solo than other games in the series (either with or without the bots). Due to the supply lines, battles, and commands/special activities with many exceptions, I also do not find it as "new-player-friendly" as some on here. Typical GMT high-quality production values, though. If I had friends who wanted to play, I'd play, but I doubt I'll ever suggest this one instead of a different COIN game, and I'll likely never play it solo again. So, a 6.

FUN ★★★★✰
The COIN system is something different from the other (war)games so tnat it requires some time to get used to. The difficulty doesn't come from the rules but rather from the choices that each player has when he's eligible to play. The shortest scenario may take 5-6 hours of play.

RULES ★★★★✰
The rules are well written. A playbook (thanks to GMT) explains a play.

IMMERSION ★★★★✰
The cards depict many stories of the Caesar's Gallic Wars. The COIN system is quite abstract though. I'd prefer miniatures and a larger map, but this is absolutly personal. I like also the explanation of the cards that has been included to the playbook.

DEPTH ★★★★★
I need to play much more to be certain of this 5/5, but I can see that this game can be played many times before having the impression of mastering it (not rule-wise but on the strategy/tactic side).

RATING: 7.5
This was my first try at a COIN game and it seemed like a fresh approach to a multiplayer game. I like the asymmetry in faction objectives and capabilities with highly thematic events. Very interesting depiction of the Roman army's strength but difficulty in operating deep in enemy territory. I've lowered my opinion with subsequent plays though -- it seems like victory mostly hinges on the event card timing with respect to the end of the year and flying under the radar in terms of victory conditions (which are a bit of a chore to update after every impulse and thus easy to miss, especially the Aedui -- whose victory conditions are, literally, not even on the radar).

Main negative is that it can be long and difficult to teach to new players. This must be the longest and prose-deep manual I've seen. Also, the wording on some of the cards (and player aids) is EXTREMELY obscure and clarifications should absolutely be included in the card-list in the playbook.

This design is easier to get into than I initially imagined (smart move by the COIN team to return to a Cuba Libre level of complexity for this volume). The game does take a long time to play, however.

Things are tightly focused, making this the most accessible COIN game to get into. There's a good sense of what each faction wants to accomplish right from the get-go. I really like the addition of the 5th non-player faction (Germanic tribes).

Play is really tense on the small map, Leaders play a major role, and things start out as a 4-way knife fight in a phone booth and then escalate from there. 

Truly an excellent game.

RATING: 7
Interesting game with 4 main components I like:
- Theme: the theme is about the Romans putting things straight in Gallia. Interesting period, evoked also very well by the events. 
- Event drive deck means for replayability, though the events itself will become familiar.
- Asymmetric player powers and win conditions. This is a huge one, keeping me interested in this game even it has some disadvantages (see below). It basically is '4 games in one' as each faction plays very, very differently. With the Romans, you are the whip, taking out your legions for some serious bashing, while time is on your side. With the Belgians, you are the immediate threat, hoping to grab the win before the Romans cement their position in the north-east. With the Arveni, you are the guy that boast you are a great leader, but any move you make will have serious consequences: if you move aggressively against Rome, the Aedui will stab you in the back, if you move against the Aedui they will maintain being a pain and the Belgians will face Rome alone. Finally the Aedui, you're the scheming bastard, vying for control of Gallia and sucking up to the Romans. As the other three factions are all focused around warfare, control and military, everyone tends to think about Allied tribes as a minor aspect to the game, but this is your main victory condition. So there is a natural inclination to overlook what you're doing... until winter pops-up and it is suddenly too late. This is the best aspect of the game.
- Novel action selection mechanism, in which you are not only choosing your own action, but also dictating what the other faction that comes after you is doing. IF they come after you, as that is decided by the faction order on the cards drawn and you have no influence on that. In essence, the action selection is a part that cannot be ignored and almost feel like a small mini-game of itself. You'll have to weigh whether you can distract focus from the main game to grab that single event netting you more advantage in the long run. This creates an ebb-and-flood in the game which allows other to jump in on the advantage of you doing effectively nothing 'on the map'.

Dislike:
- Lots of little rules. While good for theme, it is quite annoying that either you should commit a 40+ GMT rulebook to memory or hope things are about as you think they might be. While I absolutely have no complaints about the rulebook (as it is a perfect reference while playing), I like playing games more than looking up little rules. Yes, it comes with fine player aids, but these are small booklets in of itself. Therefore, it has a steep learning curve, unless you're already into wargaming and 40+ page rulebooks filled with 3.3.4. type paragraphs and caveats all over. This being said, the rulebook is excellent for looking stuff up, so it actually is more about glossing over the main rules and just looking up everything as you go, with the rulebook becoming more and more valuable over time.
- The action selection, while creating a variable tension and preventing straight steamrollering feels too disconnected from the main game. It is a game of itself, and while some might find it very enjoyable, for me it distracts from the main essence of the game: the dudes on a map principle.
- Combat: combat is not an affair of exciting and unforeseen outcomes (except one which is too random, seel below) but actually bogs the game down as the attacker will pre-calculate all the scenarios before the attack is actually made: if I attack this province now, you'll get X losses, divided by your Citadel/Fort and will hit such and such back. Or you'll retreat and get X losses. Ok, then I need only such and so troops. After all calculations are done, combat is simply 'resolved'. No luck, no randomness, no tension. Meh.
- Game design choices. This is more serious: the whole outcome of a strategically planned campaign can fall with two things: the surprise draw of an early winter (ok, this can be mitigated for) or the roll of a single die. Why o why, brothers Ruhnke, did you settle for a single D6 to decide whether Caesar can be ambushed or not? Did no one ever tell you that with a D6 the distribution is equal along all sides, so for all this planning, memorizing and strategic bickering there is a flat level 50% chance you lose the game (by getting him ambushed proper), 50% chance you win the game (by being able to hit back with your amazing legions)? This feature alone almost kills the game for me.

This all being said, I enjoyed our couple of games. While it has its dislikes, the variable player powers and high replayability combined with an attractive looking map and components (for GMT standards) makes it a game I'd enjoy playing again.
Recommended for GMT gamers looking for lighter fare and variable player powers, thematic buffs looking for a unique theme or players that feel Chaos in the Old World is a fine game but a tad too light-weight for them (or disliked its theme).

The COIN series is interesting to me because of it's great idea of multiple factions you can play solo, while still opening up multi-player. The downside so far was that the conflicts are not really what I would like to play as a game - but running Caesar against gallic tribes, that sounds more like what I want to do in games. First tutorial play shows it deeper than Cuba Libre, but the faction goals seem more intuitive to me, as well as the game structure.

Very interesting adaptation of the COIN system, which works surprisingly well in that context. The rules are a little on the complex side, with lots of special cases, but it adds flavor and depth. 

It is long, which can be a problem - it is relatively difficult to prepare one's turn in advance since the card draw can radically alter the possible moves.

RATING: 7.5
[thing=163154][/thing] is a game that recreates (somewhat) the events in Gaul and nearby regions around 54 BC. [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing] is part of the COIN (Counter Insurgencies) series. In this game players take the role of one of four different factions:
- Rome (government);
- Aedui (the negotiators, friendly towards Rome);
- Arverni (the main rebels/insurgents);
- Belgic tribes (the secondary rebels/insurgents).

All of these factions has unique objectives in the game, and also has different actions (though they are similar). The core of the game is: every turn the Event card will show which will be the order of action in the turn. At first, every faction are available to take action, but only the first two will be able to do something. However, once these two take their actions, they won't be eligible for the next turn - thus they won't to anything in. This makes the decision for [u]when[/u] to do something as important as to [b]what[/b] to do, because the factions will usually only take one action for every two turns (and, sometimes, only once in three rounds).

Also, the first player to choose an action defines what the next one will be able to do. The table works as follows:
- Faction OP only (do a full normal action) ---> Faction limited OP (a normal action, but limited to only one region);
- Faction OP with special activity (a full normal action plus a special action) ---> Faction limited OP or Event (use the event card);
- Event ---> Faction OP with special activity.

So, if you want that the next faction, no matter which, do only a limited action, you can choose to do only a normal (full) action, it is worst than do the OP with the special activity, but this would open the Event for the next faction to act on it. Therefore, not only is necessary for the first player of the turn to choose which action to take (considering that he won't be able to do anything in the next turn) while also pondering about what he will allow the next player to do.

All the factions play differently - the Arverni, Belgic tribes and Aedui have almost the same main actions (but differ in the special action), but the Events of them, and the objectives set them well apart - which gives a great feel for the game, and makes the replay value higher. Also, [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing] brought leaders (Cesar, Ambiorix and Vercingetorix), that boosts to action - usually in battle -; they make deep impact in the game - but can die. To enhance replay value, [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing] has different scenarios, which change starting positions and length (amount of cards in the deck) of play.

Is important to mention that in [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing], while there is the necessity of a greater strategy, the main factor is tatical decisions - players must constantly adjust their decisions to answer to what the others are doing and to make best use of the cards and the round order. Winter phase (where victory conditions are checked) comes with the Winter card, and while players have some idea of when the cards can appear (due to the way the deck is built), there is few certainties. Boldness and some luck will help.

The luck aspect is present - although combat is mostly deterministic, allies, forts and legions roll in order to absorb damage. But mainly luck comes from the random order to the cards in the Events deck. The turn order and the sequence of them can make or break some factions (and give some truly long downtime). Yet, usually the mechanics allow for balanced and tense games - but often in the long side, around 5 hours.

Finally, one thing that must be said is that [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing], though a great game, [b]isn't a wargame[/b] - from what I take as wargames. [thing=163154]Falling Sky[/thing] has more things in common with [thing=93][/thing] and [thing=62219][/thing] than with [thing=21050][/thing] or [thing=243][/thing]. For me it is a area control / area majority with goals and high level of "in your face" actions. Again, this isn't a negative point, it is just a point of warning to avoid frustrations.

Overall, I truly enjoy the ways of the game, the theme and the way is is handled, the beautiful board, and the tug of war between diplomacy, positioning, and battles, in order to keep friends while knowing only one will win in the end.

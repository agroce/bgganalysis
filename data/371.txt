GAME: Mystery Rummy: Murders in the Rue Morgue
RANK: 2080
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game was interesting but for some reason it did my head in. I found it hard to communicate with my partner through the passing of cards. I'd like to say it was because I was tired... in reality it's because I stink at rummy. However, I'd like to give the Jack the Ripper version of Mystery Rummy a go. I think that sounds a bit more appealing, and is one that I would consider purchasing if I enjoyed it (and got used to the game a bit more).

It's pretty cool to see this theme being used in the tabletop medium, and the rules booklet here is written better than its predecessor (Jack the Ripper). That said, the game plays fairly similar to that, with the difference being the Orangutang hidden deck played in the middle of the table. Decent, but not the best in the series.

RATING: 6
1 play.  I don't think it's as good as MR#1, MR#4 or Wyatt Earp, but it has some interesting decisions.  Lacks wild cards and has a lot of different color suits, which is probably a bad thing... leading to longer, lower scoring games or run-away leaders (from luck of draw).

I really am a fan of the Mystery Rummy series, but this was my first time playing Mystery Rummy: Murders in the Rue Morgue. The game play felt very mediocre, while not a bad game I'm not sure when I'd reach for this one instead of the other entries in the series. The rulebook does state that this game is especially good as a 4 player team game, so maybe I'll have to give that a shot.

Jack the Ripper is best with two players.
The difference between JtR and the others, is there is a guessing element to the game. At one point, you may make a gamble on who is Jack - if you are correct you get points.
That is nowhere else in the MR games.
Jekyll and Hyde - is strictly a two player game.
Rue Morgue - is good with partners
Al Capone - is Canasta-like
Bonnie and Clyde - is umm... not the best in the series.
Escape from Alcatraz - can be a bit more complicated and confusing.

Um.. its rummy. With action cards and bonus points. Not too exciting except for the orangatang stack. Deciding which cards to bury and then wrestling to get the stack makes this game something worth playing (beyond any other version of rummy with action cards).

A nice variant to the Mystery Rummy Series. I especially like the feeding of the Oraguntan, may be a bit too powerful though. Better with 4 players in teams of 2.

RATING: 10
I like this game a lot.  However, most people like the 4 player team aspect, which is very cool.  However, I have found that the 4 player version initially takes 1/2 hour or so per hand (trying to decide what is right for you and your partner) and results in no points in a lot of hands (i.e. draw pile runs out twice).  However, once the players warm up to it, it is one of the best 4 player team games there is.

RATING: 8
Fantastic partnership game.  The orangutan really puts a great twist on the entire Mystery Rummy series.

RATING: 6
Second in the Mystery Rummy series, based on Poe's story.  Fairly standard entry into the series, the quirk here being every meld made inserts another card into the Orangutan.  Whoever goes out gets to add the Orangutan's cards to their melds, if they fit.  Probably the weakest of the series, but still good to play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There is a decent strategy game here, but it lacks the elegance of the Al Capone rummy game. 

Most suits have a bonus for melding a related suit. There is a "jackpot" pile of cards for the player who goes out to end the round, which secretly builds up as play proceeds every time a suit is melded.

RATING: 6
Another game in the Mystery Rummy series.  The focus of this game is linked melds and the Orangutan.  The linked melds offer bonus scoring opportunities regardless of whether they're both in your play area or not.  If they are in your area you'll get 10 points in the round, if both are in play (regardless of yours or your opponents) the appropriate gavel card can give you 7 points, and if you get both bonuses you have the opportunity to achieve a shutout.  The Orangutan allows for a build up of cards underneath it through the round.  If a player/team can end the hand before running out of the draw deck you will get the cards underneath to add to your tableau.  This is a bit dull with two but is quite interesting when played as a 4 player partnership game.

This game will play w/2 or 3 players, but it doesn't really sing until you play 4 player w/partners. The passing strategies can be difficult, as are decisions about what to do with the blind (Orangatun). If you dismissed this w/out playing it as a partnership, you MUST try it again.

Excellent fast-playing partnership game for four players, very lean and streamlined.  The veiled communication between partners is well integrated, adding another whole layer to an otherwise simple game.  Placing cards in the "orangutan" kitty is a nice twist that achieves several desirable goals with one simple mechanism.If you like these Mike Fitzgerald rummy-related games, I recommend Jack the Ripper for two players, Wyatt Earp for three, and Murders in the Rue Morgue for four.  I don't recommend Al Capone or Jekyll and Hyde.

Mar09: I'm only one play in, but I'm really enjoying it so far.  The Orangutan is just an awesome mechanic.  It's not that you "get the kitty" for going out.  Instead, it's all about controlling what goes into the kitty.  Just how juicy do you want it to be?  Do you think you're going to be the one who gets it?

Also, the bonuses coupled with the brilliant deductions make for an awesome dilemma as well.  If you can pull them both, that's a great one-two punch.  But it also seems like the opponent has a great chance to save some face with a brilliant deduction.

I'm still not sure I like it better than Jack the Ripper, but it beats the pants off of Al Capone.

* Kickstarted with #5! *

Second in the series plays pretty much the same way as the first: draw a card. Put down melds of evidence and/or use a single gavel card. Then discard. Round ends when someone has no more cards. It's the same system as the other mystery rummy games BUT the catch here is the orangutang. The orangutang gets a card from every player to start, another is added every time a meld is placed, and if you go out before the deck is recycled then you get all those cards as bonuses. That makes the ape a bit too powerful because it causes major jumps in the scoring and that gap is sometimes too hard to fill. 2-4 players, though 4 is really teams of 2.

PLUS: easy to learn
MINUS: the orangutang is too powerful, tiny rule book packed with the cards

I played this a number of times as a two-player game. I enjoyed it, but for one aspect. On many hands, as the orangutan gets fatter and fatter, it becomes clear that whoever goes out will deal the other player a crushing blow by virtue of getting all those other cards. It's the same feeling I get when I play Canasta and the discard pile reaches a lofty height - that sense of desperation that blots out all enjoyment of the game.

I finally tried Rue Morgue as a partnership game, and decided immediately that partner play is where this one really shines. But maybe that's because I always seemed to give my partner the card he needed to complete a meld whenever we played Dupin's Help. Feed that monkey, baby!

Interesting things of note that are different in this mystery rummy are the bonus 10 points for a complementary meld with a partnering color, the gavel card giving 7 point bonus for two partnering colors being melded, subtraction of points for unusable cards left in hand, and the orangutan (kitty).  I would be interested in giving this a go as a partner game.

Great with four players, good with 3 players, ok with 2.  With 2 you either score nothing or you score everything.  Too hard to dump your cards.  Dupin's Help cards are both a curse and a blessing with 2 or 3.  You get extra cards, but if you don't get what you want, you're just adding cards that will count against you in the end.

This game just didn't grab us. There are many better games out there for two players that I can't see wanting to play this again. I've heard that this game improves with 4 but then there are so many better games out there for four players...

I like the Poe story,* but this is the blandest of the [i]Mystery Rummy[/i] series. Yet Ginny likes it, so it gets played more than its reasonable share. Finally tried the partnership game, which was pretty good. [24 plays]

RATING: 7
2nd game in the MR series and one that allows 2-4 to play (including team play). The unique twist here is the Orangutan, which can be feed cards that are won by the player or team that goes out before the draw deck is exhausted for the 1st time. A nice game but not the best in the series for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This was pretty bad. Even worse than Escape From Alcatraz, which I thought was pretty pedestrian compared to the other Mystery Rummy games. Not only is the hook here pretty underwhelming (Winner gets a bunch of cards piled up under the Orangutan card), the overall flow of the game feels really disjointed. Playing this felt more akin to regular Rummy than anything unique, as a lot of times the best you could hope to do is save up cards from turn to turn to try and get a meld made. In the other MR games, that seems to rarely if ever happen. Definitely a skippable entry in the series, as the theme is the only good thing about this one.

Finally...oh so finally...we found a copy of this game! Not disappointed...no...very much worth the wait! Basic rummy game except you begin with feeding the Orangutan 2 cards. Each time a player lays down a meld he feeds the Orangutan a card from the case files or discard pile. The person to go out will receive the Orangutan's cards. But, all players will benefit if some of the O's cards match the cards stuck in their hand (these cards will be discarded).

RATING: 6
The special action cards elevate the game from Rummy. The Orangutan provides the point of difference here - effectively it's a kitty of scoring cards for whoever goes out first if they can go out before the deck runs out for the first time. It's added to each time someone melds. With points in the hand scoring against you, you're encouraged to meld early, although this does allow other people freebie point placements as well. As a 3 player, it still felt like a luck-fest - whoever got luckiest with the opening hand going out first as fast as they can and scoring best when adding the kitty and no minuses. One reason for not going out is if you're close to melding matching colours, which score a huge bonus. Definitely something to play for. Pleasant enough time-passer, but too much luck to be a staple.

Really like the theme and presentation behind the Mystery Rummy games. Rue Morgue, unlike the Ripper, is incredibly straight forward - perhaps too much so. There's not enough to think about (forget about two players, you play it on auto pilot) and each hand is over a bit quicker than I'd like. Still, I'd be up for a four player anytime, but my wife and regular gaming buddy loathed it.

Now my collection is complete!  (At least until Bonnie and Clyde comes out.  If it ever does.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
have only played this partnership, but can't imagine it playing with any other number.  The ability for partners to interact (via passing cards during a round) helps lift this game above other partnership games.  It also plays quickly and is a way to fill in the last 30 minutes of a games night.

[4 plays]  I am fond of rummy and rummy variants as they were favorites of mine as child.  Now I prefer strategy boardgames, but still like to play rummy on occasion.  This is a solid rummy variant that I have played with 2 and 4 players now.  It has worked and gone over well each play. A decent game to play against my wife, she enjoys this game as well.

RATING: 6.5
[U.S. Games 1999 edition] {Mystery; rummy-variant; optimal 2 or 2vs2} MR#2 is a thematic family card game.  It's interactive and fun.  The rules are not as intuitive as other MR games due to the feeding of Orangutan.  The feeding of Orangutan provides planning for a hand, in which players could develop a secret plan to get better scores.  The variety of Gravel cards is the fewest in the series; thus, it provides limited tactical options and requires high hand management skill, which makes it not the most popular game in the series. In addition, it's the most difficult one in the series to go out.

The partnership part is interesting.  Players have to communicate information effectively using the Dupin's Help card and through smart card play.  This is the best partnership game in the series.

I prefer the shut-out rule variant because it adds excitement to the game.

Another in the excellent Mystery Rummy series, which seem to be good 'feeder' games for anyone looking to progress a 'non-gamer' from basic card games into the wonderful world of designer card and board games. I think I prefer this slightly to Jekyll and Hyde, which we also have.

RATING: 6
It's a little weird to see a Rummy variant with a kitty and a card-passing mechanism.  It makes me think of a trick-taking game, but it does sort of work in relation to the game.  I like the idea of the kitty being available to the player who goes out, but only if players haven't cycled through the deck once already.  I'd like to play this one again.

1 play: 4 players

RATING: 7
I think my father-in-law summed this game up very well: "The novelty factor is fun, but if I was looking for something to play 5 nights a week, I think I'd stick with regular rummy." My biggest issue with it is that there's not a reliable way to increase the number of cards in your hand (one of the changes is that the top card of the discard is the only one available to you, though some card powers do let you search), so between that and the relatively small number of possible melds, you can often find yourself in situations where you have to discard something that hurts you or helps your opponent. It's not a bad game, but not one that's going to replace regular rummy for me.

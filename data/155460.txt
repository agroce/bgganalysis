Picked up as a gift for my wife who is a rabid JRRT fan.  After playing this a few times I can see why Cryptozoic's Cerberus engine isn't beloved by the community.

Not a lot of sense to be made here when playing cards that are supposed to be tied to a very lore rich environment.

Ex: Gandolf finds a pony, has second breakfast twice, takes a rest and uses a pint.  Result? Ork bad guy is slain. My reaction to this was... wut?

I really do like how they are releasing this more than they did with the original LOTR trilogy of deck building games. You'll get this base set which also covers the first movie, and then instead of reissuing bigger boxes with the same cards, you can get smaller expansions for Smaug and (eventually) Five Armies.

There are some other, minor differences, like here your oversized character card has a permanent power, like the character you choose in DC Deckbuilder. In the LOTR that was a card you shuffled in, but now it's always active when applicable.

Fun deck building game. I know there is a solo variant out there.

The Lord of the Rings Deckbuilding games burned me out on Deck Building games. 

If I solo played a deck building game I would always choose to play Legendary, Resident Evil or Thunderstone. 
If I played a Deck Building game with other people, I would always choose Nightfall, Trains or one listed above.

No room in collection for this. Is this a bad game? Not at all!
Just too many similiar games in my collection to keep this one.

My wife asked me if I like this better than the LotR deck-builders by Cryptozoic.  The answer was easy: "No."  However, it is good, and I do like it.  Plus it was a steal at $10.  And it goes nicely with the other LoTR versions by Cryptozoic.  No complaints here.

Players play one of the characters from the Hobbit, and build a deck of cards to defeat the enemies and score victory points.  Standard deck building stuff for these days - draw five, play, buy new cards and/or defeat enemies, which are all stuffed into your deck to make it stronger.  Nothing stands out in this one - it plays fast and cleanly. Just like the others in the series the concept of enemies means you can get your hand totally destroyed by the previous player flopping a bad card for you. So there is really no point thinking until it's your turn, as you have no idea what your hand will look like until the player to your left has finished.  Not totally awful, but a long way off acceptable.

Deck building: reminiscent of Dominion, but more randomness (only 5 cards to buy from and they keep changing).  Various meta powers of the cards tend to be hard to use to much advantage.  Some interest in that you can build an allies deck, an enemies deck, or try for "big money".

Very pleasing deck builder.  Simple, with only one type of points.  But has fighting and buying, and killed enemies actually become cards.  Good bit of structure and story too.  A bit conventional, but right up our alley.

RATING: 7
Same engine as DC Comics and the LotR DBG from the same publisher.

Per the LotR games, the theme is well rendered, and minor tweaks in Characters, card types and Villain/Enemy deck, changes the game slightly.

Does it justify adding yet another copy in your collection?  Maybe not, but if you're into LotR, why not, the images are nice, and there is a mention that the games can be combined.

Not good, but I think it is a little underrated. The game is what it is, a light deck building with a little spice on it; people should not judge it too harshly. Un DBG light que usa imágenes y motivos de las películas The Hobbit de P. Jackson. Semi agresivo, pero lo mejor es conseguir buenas cartas rápido para atacar pronto al deck de monstruos que te dan un buen botín. Si picas al frente tus oponentes lo sufrirán...

This is the fourth game in the Cerburus Lord of the Rings lineup and once again it isn't a massive departure from the original. Unfortunately I found it to be the least enjoyable simply because the movie was the weakest of the 4.

A great game that can be combined with the other LotR deck builders.  Easy to learn, and mechanics introduced in this game make it very unique and fun. My only issue with it has is if a player isn't planning their play beforehand, turns can get very long and bore everyone else as they wait for them to finish.

Very uninspired compared to the other deck builders from Cryptozoic. Maybe it's because I'm not that big of a fan of the theme, but this game is very dull compared to those that came before it. I'm not a fan of the loot system, and I don't like that they deviated from how LOTR heroes are designed. On its own, this game is fine, but the word that just keeps coming to my mind is "uninspired."

Good theme and easy to learn for new Deck builders.

A few cards are overpowered but you can just leave them out or make house rules.

Also what is missing is more hero or power generation revolving around enemy, despair or corruption cards.  i could make up some rules and cards that would open up another build type whereas everyone wants either a draw up deck or a maneuver/artifact deck.

8 overall because its fast, fun, and quick to learn.

Another licensed title from the Cryptozoic deckbuilder mill. Very similar to the previous LOTR deckbuilders from Cryptozoic. Still too derivative, too mediocre and too long/draggy for what it offers.

Some frustration points that are easily resolved:

* The four loot cards are four orange maneuver cards and four blue artifact cards. they say look on the middle right of the card.

* The level of the Archenemies are in the same place, the middle right of the troll, great goblin and Azog card. Thus with Saruman's ability of "+Power and draw cards equal to the level of the Archenemy in play" means that playing Saruman while the trolls are out will give you +1 power and 1 card.

* Print out the game mat on this site.

A nice addition to the LOTR Deck-building series of games. My favorite is still The Fellowship of the Ring; however, it's nice to have some variety in this genre.  The games are easy to teach and can be played when table space is at a premium--i.e. family gatherings, etc.

Take dominion but cut any card that is at all interesting.  Make the expensive/good cards also give you VP and cut all vanilla VP cards.  Add random events that screw just one player, and asymmetric start cards that don't even try to be balanced.  Tack on some photo-art from the movie, some of which is too dark to even make out.  Ta da!

Making the strategy so obvious (always buy the best card available that you can) does help use the game to teach kids how to play deck builders.  But Dominion with simple cards also does that.

I enjoy this one more, I think, than the other LotR deckbuilders from Cryptozoic.  The character powers that are constantly available and the "loot" that you earn from the bosses are really nice changes.  Somehow, this game (especially with the expansion) seems to take far too long as you add more people though.  We play it almost exclusively with 2, but it still takes us at least 1.5 hours.

The first impression was extremely positive. The hero powers on the hero card itself improved the thematic experience. The game plays smooth and everybody seemed able to pull off huge combos and ultimately feel powerful. Probably less "confrontational" than the Street Fighter Deck-building game, but just as fun.

I'm not sure who I'm writing this for, exactly.  The only other sucker in the universe who keeps buying Cryptozoic deck-building games, regardless of the intelligence of doing so?

Still, I'm embarrassed to admit that I enjoy every chapter in the series - including this one.  Every time I think they've ground the life out of LOTR deck-building, the creative team keeps adding thematic variations (e.g., loot cards) and character powers that keep me from falling asleep.  And new card effects magically keep appearing, despite the limited phase space of deck-building design.

So the strait-jacket of the system is still loose enough to allow for occasional innovation, though whether that continues to occur remains to be seen.

End note:  It's curious that Cryptozoic regressed back to the DC Comics system of having character powers in effect at all times, rather than being printed on a card that goes into the player's deck.  Always-active powers can warp the game, since blessed players will continually reap the benefits of their better powers, while the second-tier powers will continually disappoint their owners.

Initial play went decent but not awesome, mostly because I messed up some of the rules.  Who knew that fire was so complicated?

I expect the rating to go up, due to the strategic nature of the cards and abilities, once we get over the initial learning curve.

Ended up trading this on, as it fell into a middle area of the "excitement vs quick" scale, it wasn't as quick as Jaipur or Odin's Ravens, and it wasn't as exciting as other, fuller games, like Clank or Castles of Mad King Ludwig.

my best 1vs1, its very rare too play a good immersive and not abstract one. Strategy, oportunism and luck are very balanced. And assymetry is fun, two camps well balanced. Its fun to try to guess wich card is going to play the other player

RATING: 8
awesome 2 player asymmetrical game, where one is trying to capture baby raptors with scientists, and the other is attempting to accompany the babies to safety and eat the evil scientists. The mindgames of the card play works very well. The game looks great on the table too. Well done from the brunos.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The asymmetrical nature of this raptors versus scientists contest comes across very well in the different victory conditions and available actions. I might wonder why scientists out to capture baby dinos go equipped with flamethrowers, but thematically that's this game's only misstep.    My problem is with Raptor's central mechanic, the simultaneous choice of a card from hands of three.  The lower value implements a special action, while the higher gets the difference in values (up to eight) in action points.  Six, seven or eight actions should be game changing.  To some extent, this can be avoided by card counting and hand management.  All the same Raptor is just too swingy for my taste.

Production and artwork strike me as sub-par for a Matagot game.  The minis are unnecessarily tiny, while the box insert will eventually cause the bowing of player aids that won't sit flat upon it.  The cards are quite thick, but not of the best quality.  The artwork is messy and unappealing.   The rules are OK.  Inexperienced players will be referring back to them often because the player aids lack some important details.

This is a brilliant and highly thematic game.  From the simultaneous selection (trying to outguess your opponent), to the use of special abilities versus action points, the asymmetry of both sides - makes for a game that can be strategic and tempered with just enough luck.  Great components - highly thematic with quick turns, really nice components and it is over and done in quick time, just begging you to play again.  LOVE IT!

A satisfying game if you want to have a good battle, but don't have time for a longer game. This is right up there with Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation for fun, quick-playing asymmetric 2 player games (but with a broader appeal, which is a plus).

I really prefer to play the mama Raptor! Just looking at the board I get sucked into the theme.

RATING: 5
In this game, players play cards (value 1-9) simultaneously. The player with the lower value does the card's effect. And the player with the higher value gets general actions (equal to the difference between both cards) to spend. Furthermore, both players have different cards, actions, and end-game considerations, which makes both sides feel quite different.

Overall, the game feels and its asymmetrical nature is quite intriguing. That being said, this game lacks a certain amount of elegance, which is worsened by a vague ruleset and a poorly written player mat. The overall effect is a game that feels out-of-place... something too complicated to be a filler yet too luck-driven to be anything more.

One of the best two-player board games out there. The asymmetry makes it easy to replay. With no down-time, and the perfect amount of strategy, this has to be one of my favorite abstract games.

UPDATE: Lowered my ranking only because length of play and complexity feel a little much for what it is. Love the game a lot, but do not feel that is accessible enough.

AMAZING two-player, asymmetrical game all about getting in your opponents head. What card will they play? What card will you play in response? Good choices in card play all hinge on whether you want to do a lot of little things with your scientists or raptors, or one very special thing. Anticipating your neighbor in regards to which of those you're going for make this a tense, enjoyable abstract who's theme still has some serious bite.

Raptor is a wonderful game dripping with theme and clever tactical plays. This game is all about reading your opponent and playing a card that will limit their actions while benefiting you.

There's hand management, a little social deduction, action cost, minifigs, fire tokens, just... so much to love about this game. I remember exact instances of being thrilled while playing this game: when I knew exactly what card my opponent would play (which infuriated them, even though they won the game,) when a different opponent and I were stuck in a corner and it felt like either one of us could win at any moment. A great game with playful tension. Easy to understand and always fun to play.

A solid asymmetrical game with a deep thematic foray, Raptor takes on how the cards played by either player in a turn work with each other and in so doing adds a little more unpredictability to the simultaneous action selection mechanism that builds its core.

I dig this little game.  It has nice asymmetry and a solid amount of depth for its very short playtime.  Looks beautiful as well being a Matagot release.

What really is the hallmark of this design is the tension that feels like a hidden movement game without actually being a hidden movement game.  This feel is captured because you can never be sure if you will get action points or an ability and the card system fuels the drama.  This element just feels really good.

Neat asymmetric game with the cards providing great tension (special ability of lowest card vs action points based on the difference in the card values), nice figures and obstacles and random tile layout.

 A little shocked by this game. I wasn't anticipating liking it because of the abstract nature of the game, but the theme and mechanics fit well and I was impressed. I like the multiple paths to victory and the use of cards. Although, playing a low card at the incorrect time can be extremely harmful and give an opponent too many actions, may be too difficult to recover. Overall, Solid 2 player game.

A very strategic game of punching and counter punching your way to your objectives. Given the amount of thought involved it feels like Targi, but a little quicker. Play a card from your hand simultaneously to either get the action (lowest card) or get action points (highest card). For some reason in 2 games we could never get this right and had to keep checking. Since all the cards are out on the table you have an idea of what your opponent may play and in that way I get a feeling of a slightly deeper Hanamikoji with some of the bluffing and outguessing that goes on each turn. Definitely a unique game and another good Bruno Cathala game. I am happy to play this one since my buddy owns it, but don't think I need to own it as I doubt my wife would like it.

I love this game so much, and unexpectedly so. Based on reviews and videos of the game, I wasn't super interested in trying it, but when it showed up at a game night and two of us needed to kill some time, we tried it. And loved it. And immediately switched sides to play again. WOW! The asymmetry is wonderful, trying to anticipate what the other player will do is fun, and the tactical play of the board is tricky. The double-sided map tiles were also a surprise, as the distribution of rocks from jungle to savannah is a nice way to switch up the game. So much love, and an instant new favorite. A Top 10 Game.

This is a good, balanced 2 player game. I have played as both the scientists and the raptors. 

While there is a slight element of luck (drawing 3 cards rather than having all 9 to play). It is an exciting game no matter what side you are on.. It could potentially be seen as unbalanced to people who are new to the game. But if both players are playing smart then the scientists wont overrun the raptors. In each game I have played it has been very close. Both parties have been one away from winning. This is an exciting tension for this game.

Mamma Raptor has escaped from her run and laid her eggs in the park. A team of scientists must neutralize her and capture the baby raptors before they run wild into the forest. Card driven boardgame with tactical play and some double guessing. Players use their cards to move their pawns (scientists on one side, Mother and baby raptors on the other) on the board.

Oh man, this game is AWESOME! I love the blend of clever card play and having to read your opponent's mind, and making smart choices on the board itself. This game is quick, and you will end wanting to play another round. Both sides play differently, but I recommend playing the same side several times before switching. Once you know both sides and know the potential actions in each deck well (they are also spelled out on the player aid/mat), you can really get into the strategy quite a bit. Highly recommend!! One of my favorite two player games ever.

Un excellent jeu asym√©trique pour 2 joueurs avec un th√®me fort !
Les r√®gles sont simples et extr√™mement bien r√©dig√©es (les rares points d'ombre trouvent leurs r√©ponses sur les forums de Tric Trac).
Le mat√©riel est de bonne facture (attention quand m√™me au d√©punchage) et les illustrations superbes contribuent √† cr√©er une immersion agr√©able. La mise en place est rapide (< 2minutes !). 

Il faut quelques parties avec chaque camp pour ma√Ætriser les effets des cartes et les actions, et puis apr√®s on se r√©gale, on √©labore sa tactique en fonction des cartes en main et on esquisse des combos‚Ä¶ Les grandes lignes strat√©giques de chaque camp s'entre-aper√ßoivent apr√®s plusieurs parties (les erreurs √† ne pas commettre, les combos efficaces, faire le meilleur choix de carte connaissant les cartes que l'adversaire a d√©j√† pos√©es‚Ä¶)

Aucun temps mort dans le gameplay et des rebondissements tr√®s int√©ressants. Les parties s'encha√Ænent, chaque joueur en redemande et veut prendre sa revanche. Beaucoup, beaucoup de plaisir avec ce jeu qui tient toutes ces promesses et qui r√©v√®le sa richesse et sa profondeur de jeu au fil des parties.

J'adore ce jeu !

Really solid 2p, quick, asymmetric game that is maybe a bit lighter than, say, Mr. Jack.   The game can be played very casually like Mr. Jack, but like that game, it also ramps up to another level when you begin to calculate the moves ahead and begin to second-guess what cards the opponent might play.    The simultaneous reveal means that this will never be as heavy as Mr. Jack, but that's okay since I already have 3 version of that game.   The mechanisms here are quite different anyway.  The theme is strong enough, and the graphic presentation is quite good.   

I will complain about the tiny, tiny miniatures, however.  Come on.   They could easily be 50% bigger and the game wouldn't cost two dollars more.   That's my only complaint about the whole package, really.   Oh, well, the cards are an odd size and should probably be sleeved, but that's tricky too.

This game is fun. I think the mechanics work better for 2 players than for more like in Mission Red Planet. It is a cool theme. I feel like it really needs an expansion to give it some more meat. It's too short without much strategy. My last game ended in 6 turns which is just way too short.

Quite a fun little 2 player card game with a physical board full of Baby Raptors (cute) and Scientists (evil). Gameplay is similar to R by the designer of Love Letter - players play a card from a deck of nine cards which either allows them a special action or a number of Action Points to spend on various actions. Capture the babies or escape with them, plays quickly and is fun for two!

30-45m, 2 players. < 5 plays.

Interesting game, I like the asymmetric implementation here, very thematic. Couple critiques:

- Some times you just don't have the right cards... guess this is a common critique of all card games... but you may really need to take basic actions but only have low valued cards in hand... similarly, this may enable your opponent to get a large number of basic actions. Keeping a hand of 3 should help to mitigate this... but this exact scenario did happen in my only game

Its amazing that two decks of nine cards can create such a rich gaming experience. The mind games between players, and the ever shifting game states fosters what has become one of my favorite fillers. Scientists try to hurriedly fill the forest and cage in the raptors with men and fire, while the raptors utilize speed and stealth to thin out their oppressors and exploit new paths. Players will shift between needing standard actions, and needing card actions, which adds a sense of desperation to the already terrific simultaneous card play. So far the scientists have proven most powerful, but that makes wining as the raptors that much more rewarding.

Great asymmetrical strategy game. The card mechanic is very innovative, at least I haven't seen it before and can lead to some interesting decisions. Not sure if both sides are super balanced, but regardless, as long as both sides have a decent chance it's fine for me. Also fun and well executed theme!

Wanted to really like it as I was looking forward to getting a copy since Essen 2015, but it was 'just OK' towards 'meh' for me. Enjoyable, but just passes the time. The artwork is brilliant, and the minis are cute, but it's still just an abstract strategy game - optimal placement, movement etc. reminds me of Hnefatafl (viking chess). I can't really see what all the fuss is about. 

My other half thought it was highly unbalanced from the get go. The scientists won all of the time. Last time we played the raptors won. Then I reread the rules and realised we had missed a critical rule '[b]Every[/b] scientist on the board can do one aggressive action per turn'. We'd been playing that the scientist [b]player[/b] can only do one aggressive action per turn. He wanted to try again with the corrected rule. All that meant was that the scientist player captured 3 babies even before the first deck of cards was over. When I suggested swapping sides he said he couldn't be bothered.

We have WAY too many games we like better plus the grammatical and spelling mistakes in both the English and Dutch rules and player aids is just careless. I can't speak for the German and French ones...

A fun use of theme. The whole "low card abilities against high card action points" system is neat and creates good tension. However, you need those high cards after setting up a good move, and the card draw can really limit you there. There are also many points throughout a match when all or most of your low card abilities are ineffective.

Both of our games ended in swift victories for the raptors.  I assume this means that we were playing the scientists poorly.  I'd be down to play this again, and the theme of it is just 100% perfect, but I didn't like the way the big raptor could head to the L-shaped tiles and then use the call to bring babies to the spot.

Still, chomping scientists and tranq'ing baby raptors is good fun.

The first game lasted 3 minutes, the fourth 30. With each stupid play we realized more of the possible (better) ways to use each side's abilities or what action points we had available.

A neat little puzzle game with a great theme.  I like the asymmetry between the hunters and the raptors.  The card action/action points system is ingenious and I would be interested to see if there are other games that use it. Very smart.  Everything else serves the game well. I played as the raptors and rarely if ever used the cards purposefully for the actions.  Mainly I played my highest-valued cards and did what I could with the points (or was saved by limiting the points my opponent had). I won, but it was close, so I'd imagine this strategy doesn't always work.

RATING: 8.5
Very impressive and fun design for such a short/simple game. The basic dynamics revolve around a 9-card deck, and board positioning. In a way, I suppose it reminds me of Hey That's My fish, in that the spatial element is really important and constricted, but the cards add some flavor ala "En Garde" or Combat Commander perhaps (there is a strong wargame-like feel to this, maybe a bit of Sekigahara's bluffing element.). The downside, is that due to card limitations, and similar goals, sometimes the end game can drag. Some rounds feel like repeating events...at least until your bluff on which card you want to play inevitable goes horribly wrong...then you are eaten.

I love simultaneous selection and this game does it very well. It's a tight, asymmetric game with a sort of abstract feel. The simultaneous selection is governed by cards drawn by a very small deck. I love the small amount of randomness, you always have access to at least 1/3 of your deck and as you play more cards the game oscillates between more and less perfect information. This oscillation gives a great pacing to the game, where tension builds and releases several times in a session. The game is also very quick and as far as I can tell, the asymmetry is balanced. Smart design, beautiful components, great game!

Fun, tense little 2p game.  I like the mechanic of card ability vs action points and the tension it creates -- sometimes you really want that ability, and sometimes you just want one precious action -- and sometimes you choose to try to deny your opponent what they want.  And the playing pieces are great.

The luck-of-the-draw factor can be painful (started with low, useless cards, giving my opponent a lot of actions).  I'd play it again, but this would definitely be too tense for my wife (and maybe for me), so it's not one that I would buy.

Too cut throat for us. I really liked the game, Renu hated it and she just couldn't play the game due to its theme which was a bit violent for her, partly due to my thematic explanation of what the scientist would do to the Raptor babies after they catch them :P

RATING: 8
Very tense, asymmetrical game where one player is a raptor mom trying to save her children and the other is a team of scientists trying to capture her kids. 

After building the level from tiles and placing the characters, the players will take turns playing cards to do actions. The thing is, the lowest card played gets to resolve its action, and the highest only gets to do a number of basic actions - but sometimes that's exactly what you need so you'll have to guess what the other player will try to do.

Excellent rule set and artwork, with a fresh theme. Tense right up to the end.

This is a weird one.  The game is awesome. The mechanisms and design are fantastic.  However, I feel like the game is not in balance. I feel that the Scientists have a major advantage and that the Raptors have to really outplay the scientists to win.

Pretty good asymmetric two-player game. The players choose cards simultaneously and the special power of the card with the lower value is executed. Then, the player of the higher card spends a number of actions equal to the difference. It's a bit weird, but it works. With a limited hand of three cards, sometimes luck of the draw can determine your defeat, leading to an anticlimactic end, but there is an engaging game up to that point.

Also, dinosaurs are always cool and Matagot doesn't disappoint with their plastic miniatures. It's a shame that the theme doesn't demand different dinosaurs, but it's noteworthy that all ten scientists are unique sculpts.

A two-player game with some strategy, many tactical choices, and a take-that element.

The gameplay is, in a way, abstract. You can move in certain ways, protect your pieces, eat or capture enemies, and work to outsmart your opponent. On the other hand, it feels thematic in that each side has their own abilities and goals, and you feel the differences between the Mama raptor and her babies.

A fun, very quick, and smart little game.

Suggest: Reviving

Initial rating based on 2 plays. A solid game, it's light in rules but still very thematic.

I'm not sure about the depth now. Because there are map element and action-point system, the double-guessing on cards is not that direct and clear(say, comparing with [thing=478][/thing]). 

It certainly supports casual and tactic oriented playing style, which is fun for both adults and kids. But if the game has something more than few tactic choices for current turn, it would be great. In that case I will raising the rating to 8.

A fun and vicious little two-player abstract. The pulp exploration/dinosaur theme inspired some excellent art, but doesn't really affect the mechanics too much (the mother raptor being able to extinguish orthagonal chains of fire "with her tail" comes to mind). Nevertheless, you do find yourself becoming quite protective of your little raptor babies.

The primary mechanic of hand-management/bluffing/special-action-vs-action-points wasn't what I expected when I first heard of the game, but it's tense and fun.

Good as a filler game or for a "best out of..." match on its own.

RATING: 8
A cool, fast, fun, 2 player game.  It isn't fair to compare it to a long, multi-player game.  This game can be used as filler, but it is more than just a filler game.  As a comparison, I think of 7 Wonders: Duel in the same category.  Sure it is a filler while you are waiting for people to show up, but it is also something that I play stand alone.  

The central mechanic of the game is sound and clever - you are either getting the use of the card or action points - not both - and which one you get depends a lot on the other player.  I think the game could be improved by increasing the power of the lower numbered cards.  You often give away so many action points when you play them that I tend to avoid most of them.  Still, a good game as is.

What this game does, it does well.  Who doesn't like snacking on scientists?

In what feels like the climactic scene from Jurassic Park, one player plays a team of 10 scientists trying to sedate and capture 3 baby raptors or sedate the mother with 5 hits from a tranque gun. The raptor player tries to kill all ten scientists or have 3 baby raptors escape the board to freedom. Each player has a deck of 9 cards numbered 1-9, each with a unique special action. On a turn, players simultaneously play a card from the 3 in their hand. Lowest number uses their special action while the highest number uses the difference between the two numbers as action points - so each turn one player will use action points and the other a special action. The raptors start out spread across the board while the scientists start out with 4 of 10 scientists on the board guarding the exits. So there are lot so things going on here - bidding against your opponent for actions, maneuvering across the board, adding pieces and attrition, risk-taking and push-your-luck. The game plays quick with lots of action and careful thinking is required.

I've had quite a journey this month playing this game numerous times with my daughter. At first the scientists were winning every single game and then I realized we were getting a rule wrong. We were giving the full actions of the higher card to that player rather than the difference between the values of both cards. It turns out these extra actions greatly advantage the scientists! Our games have been slower and more closely contested since. I was ready to drop my score on this pretty low as an imbalanced game, but with the correct rules, I think this is where it should sit.

Traded.  

I think the name of the designer and the subject matter have clouded gamers view.  I think this one is really overrated.  My wife and I played this a couple times and didn't like it. I took it to local game night and after hearing the rules, the gamers who wanted to learn it decided they were no longer interested in playing it and we all changed to a different game.

Wicked scientist have invaded your territory. Their goal? Your babies! Well, that just won't do... time to teach your kids the taste of man.

The discovery of a century, a living dinosaur! The mama raptor is too dangerous though, we're better off studying the offspring. Who will bravely lead the expedition?

Raptor is a fun, quick card game with two very different sides. There is some luck involved but nothing that breaks the game for me. To do well you'll have to read your opponent, manage your hand and everyone's discard pool and not fuck up :p

Great fun.

Great party game for 2! Something quick and easy to learn and worthy of any boardgame shelf! This is a gateway game, suspenseful game, and family game all in one. I mean come on who wouldn't have tons of suspense when on the verge of being eatin by an angry mama raptor?! The look of the game reads "ends too quick surely the raptors will win in 5 minutes" but actually there are hair-splitting, sitting on the edge of your seat turning points that can make laughs and howls of victory with each card played! You won't be disappointed!

A flavour of Mr Jack, also 2-player, asymmetrical, and designed by Bruno Cathala.

The characters with special abilities are here replaced by two different decks of action cards, with the original idea of simultaneously playing a card either for its ability or for its action point overvalue (to say it briefly).

As tactical, well-balanced, and good as its so-called predecessor.

Due to having only 3 cards in your hand, strategy is very limited and you also have very little to no knowledge of what the other player is holding in their hand. Comes down to a game only "slightly" more tactical than rock-paper-scissors, and I'd rather just play rock-paper-scissors, then atleast its over quicker.

Raptor has a nice mechanic that I don't recall having seen before. 
I think i might have but I can't remember it...

Anyway the mechanic is that both palyers get a set of cards and pick one simultaneously from their hand.
The one who played the lowest gets to do the action on the card, the other one receives action points for the difference (lowest card is 2. Highest is 6. So 4 Action points) In case of a tie nothing happens unless both players played a one then they get to reshuffle their cards


Played once so far and the raptors had no problem in (b)eating the scientists.

Nice blend of mechanics , positioning yourself planning ahead, blind bidding (playing the card from your hands feel like that)


The mechanic is one that I would love to see more in games. It adds an extra dimension to the game without complicating the gameplay.


Edit played 7 times now
raptors 4/4
scientists 2/3

I don't think it is perfectly balanced , but it is pretty close and perfect for what it is.
I think if you want to blance it a bit more. the scientist could place another scientist on the board for 2 action points.
other option would be, place raptors first than the scientists
I upgraded it to a 9. 
It is funny though that the scientists do have to work as a team to beat the raptors.
I thought raptors where good at that but only the mother raptor is dangerous.

Ein reines 2-Spieler Spiel.
Ein Spieler √ºbernimmt die Forscher und muss versuchen 3 Babys zu fangen oder die Mutter zu bet√§uben (5 Angriffe), der andere Spieler √ºbernimmt die Raptoren und muss 3 Babys fliehen lassen oder alle Forscher zu fressen.
In einem Zug spielen beide Spieler verdeckt eine Karte und decken diese gleichzeitig auf. Derjenige mit dem niedrigeren Wert f√ºhrt die Aktion der Karte aus (weites Bewegen, bet√§uben, Feuer legen, ...) der andere bekommt die Differenz der Werte als Aktionen (1 Feld bewegen, Forscher aufstehen lassen, etc.).
Das Spiel fand ich nett, ich hab ja auch gewonnen, es ist aber keines das ich mir zulegen w√ºrde.
Sch√∂n fand ich, dass ich es oft geschafft habe eine Karte auszulegen, dessen Wert 1 unter dem des Gegners lag, was ein gro√üer Vorteil ist. Aber vom Hocker gehauen hat es mich leider nicht...

Cool play based on playing cards numbered 1 through 9.  One person plays as the humans trying to capture baby velociraptors.  The other plays as the mama raptor and the babies.  Humans need to capture three babies to win.  The raptor needs to get three of her babies off the map at designated points.  Each player plays a card at the same time.  The player who played the lower number card utilizes the special action on that card.  The other player uses actions that equal the difference in the cards.  For instance, if I played a 2 and you played a 6, I get to utilize the special action of my 2 card and you get to take four actions (each space moved is one action, tranquilize a baby is an action, raptor kills a scientist for an action, etc.).  I played twice as the dinos.  First game the humans cleaned house in a hurry and ran off with my clawed kids.  Second game I busted open a hole and watched the baby raptors run to their freedom.  Cool game, well balanced!  Thanks to the creators for putting together something around a dinosaur theme that's not complicated but still fun!

If I have exactly 2 players and it's between this and the other best with 2 player games in my collection, I will often opt for a game of Raptor.

I like the challenge of action points vs card ability. I like the interaction with your opponent. I like playing as both the raptor AND the scientists... This game is really... that... good!

Smooth as silk. Very easy to pick up and teach. The theme is soundly connected to the mechanisms, and there are a good amount of choices to choose from. I don't know if it was intentional, but the card selection system and subsequent actions seem reminiscent of El Grande, which is a good thing in my book. That, combined with the 2-player asymmetry and dino theme, there's not much to dislike really. Definitely going to hit the table regularly.

Un jeu au th√®me sympa (mais qui cache un jeu asym√©trique abstrait) et agr√©able √† pratiquer, mais qu'il ne vaut mieux pas confier √† des joueurs trop longs √† prendre des d√©cisions.
Apr√®s plusieurs parties on d√©couvre un jeu tactique intense, o√π l'on doit constamment observer le jeu et le placement de son adversaire afin de ne rater aucune opportunit√© de lui porter un coup.
 Un jeu √† deux de premier choix donc.

Simple and fun.  The card choice mechanic reminded me a lot of Mission to Red Planet.  Also, calling the humans "scientists" seems to be a bit of a misnomer...

This is a very interesting and fast-paced game a little like Pegasus' other game "Drako" in regard to the miniatures, the design and the box. What makes this game shine is that there isn't just one way of winning, there are two for both sides. The raptor player wins if he can make three baby raptors escape or if he kills all of the scientists on the board. So let's say that there are too many scientists on the board, instead of despairing and saying that the game is so unfair, you can rather focus on getting your raptor babies to escape. Vice-versa if you're playing the scientists player and you see that you just can't kill the raptor mother since she keeps one getting out of your reach, healing herself or for whatever reason it may be, you can switch to trying to capture three of the raptor babies to win. A pretty exciting game, doesn't last very long and the asymmetrical gameplay (that I really treasure in many games) makes it something unique. The rules are pretty simple and straightforward and the game itself fun. Recommended!

Fast playing, cat and mouse... Takes a couple of rounds to get the idea. Deeper than it first appears, but ultimately light fare. Still not clear what the strategies are, but so far in dad vs son it's 2:1, with two victories going to the scientists. A good 2 person filler. 8 placeholder score, will amend as I get in more plays.

I LOVE this game!
Is it a family game? A cutthroat gamer's game? A gateway game? A light filler?
Yes, yes, yes and yes.

Here are its virtues.

Crazy fun
Simple to learn
Play in 20 minutes
Has enough strategy to keep it tense with interesting decisions
Crazy tense-- games do down to the wire
Crazy tense-- you are about to be eaten by an angry mother velociraptor! Did you hear what I said? An angry mother velociraptor wants to EAT YOU!
Make bold, unexpected moves
No game like it
Theme is beyond cool
Asymmetric play
Modular and random map
Two "themes" for the map, jungle and savannah (not necessary, but still way cool)
For the PC crowd, as the scientists, you don't kill the baby raptors--you "capture" them
For the un-PC crowd as the momma raptor, you don't "capture" the scientists, you eat them
10 different scientist sculpts
Inexpensive (except when OOP I suppose)
You can move a plastic velociraptor around a map! Deal me in!

Virtues aplenty

Ok, what are its demerits? One major one--you sometimes will be in immanent risk of being eaten by an angry mother velociraptor. Because you were trying CAPTURE HER BABIES! WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

This is the only game of this weight I have given a 9. I think it almost deserves a 10 based on the BGG code. But I cannot countenance a situation where War of the Ring and Raptor both have a 10. But this game just makes me happy. The Brunos have my utmost respect for making this gem.

In raptor you play as the scientists or Raptors attempting to be the cleverest girl there is. This two player game is asymmetrical meaning each side has different objectives and play styles. Although if you have played as a scientist, being the raptor is not so different. It is the choices and strategy that differ rather than mechanics. 

The scientists are attempting to steal three baby raptors, or put the mama down with 5 shots of tranquilliser, while the raptors are attempting to get three babies to safety or eat all the scientists currently on the board.

Each side has number cards 1-9 with the 1-8 cards also having a special ability on them. You will shuffle your cards, draw three and play one face down. If you have played the lowest numerical number you get to use your action, if you played the highest number you get that many action points minus the lower number played.

This game has some of the best player matts/aids I have seen with all the info you need provided and has made for some great games. I feel that it is harder to win as the Raptor, but this is my only complaint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very fun asymmetrical game! At times it feels like the scientists have the advantage, but I don't think that's actually the case. There is a surprising ammount of strategy involved with the cards you play, and how you take the action once you play the card. The tactics can also change depending on what card your opponent has played. There is a bit of social deduction in the game as well. It has happened more than once that my wife and I will play the exact same card again and again, showing that we have very similar strategies, and it's fun to try and break that. The rules fit very well with the theme, and it's equally fun playing either side. One thing that takes a LITTLE bit away is once an opponent (or you) has 2 or 3 cards left in their hand, we just end up telling the other what we have in our hands, because it's quicker to do that than to have to count the cards on the table. That's a very small quibble, and other than that, I love this quick, relatively simple game!

Not as great as I expected it to be. This is a fairly simplistic game where you are either trying to get your baby Raptors to escape, or capture a certain amount of them. I found the action point system pretty clever, but the rest of the game felt very bare bones and uninteresting. This almost felt like a war game without the cinematic moments. Just goes to show that anything Faidutti touches is usually not going to gel with me...

It's fast, it's straight forward and there's a very nice artwork in it (*duhh, it's from Matagot*) On the downside, gameplay somehow feels a bit unbalanced to me.

[b]Raptor[/b] was traded away in a math trade 2/10/16. (Received Targi)

[i]This was a huge disappointment for me, I was really looking forward to a new asymmetrical 2p game that had dinosaurs! Unfortunately Raptor turned out to be really dry and procedural. The card play doesn't add as much tension to the game as I thought it would. Either you get to perform a special action or take a certain number of basic actions. Unfortunately the special actions on the cards aren't much different from the basic actions so you always feel like you are taking baby steps towards winning. I don't think the card play and board movement are well integrated, the two parts of the game feel separate each part of the game feels very separate in the end it feels very disjointed.[/i]

Raptor is a brilliant 2 player game. I like it a lot but it loses a point because there are too much little rules. These rules prevent people new to the game to grasp the game easily.

I.e. the special scientist action to put a baby to sleep has to be performed when a scientist is maximum 1 tile away. But the position of mommy raptor is no issue when waking up baby raptors with the special raptor action. 
Or you can only do 1 aggressive action for each scientist while it doesn't apply for the raptor.
Or a scientist can walk over fire.

But once you get to know the game well, then it's an epic battle which is fun to lose as well. Nicely put together.

I got a lot of plays out of this and I still want to play it more. Highly thematic and entertaining. I feel the humans have the upper hand especially if the player using them knows what they're doing. A lot of options and things to do with little components. You have to get 1-2 plays in to fully get how to play this best. It's also not very long, so invites you to play some more.

Would love at least 1 expansion - maybe triceratops. To make it a 3 player asymmetric?

An ok 2-player game. It has a lot of options to weigh against each other, but it doesn't seem to come together in a compelling way. There are turns of events where I thought "That's a valid series of moves, but I'm not sure how I could have prevented it". If I'm going to play an intricate 2-player game many times to understand all the opaque strategies, I'd rather play something like X-Wing or Mage Wars. If I want a quick game where the consequences of my decisions are easier to see I'd rather play something like 7 Wonders Duel.

It feels like this game was made just for me. From the perfect wedding of theme and mechanics to the art and the delicious tension, this game is the total package. I keep hearing complaints that it‚Äôs imbalanced, but after 50 plays I don‚Äôt find that to be the case. The rulebook seems light, but it is packed, and some nuances are easy to miss. It really took about 50 plays to get all the rules right, and everything we got wrong favored the scientists. So if your raptor never wins, read through the rules once or twice more. My favorite game was when my husband won in three card plays as the raptor by eating all my scientists, but I‚Äôve also won as the raptor without the mother moving at all. Raptor is my #1 favorite game, and it‚Äôll take a lot to top it.

This was played once or twice. Then it was forgotten about. The mechanics are strange. It has a card game mechanic which dictates what the plays are from both players. Some are successful and can add tension to the game but other plays can conflict with your opponent's choice and can have an adversely opposing result. It can be quite a strategic game but it also can be a little lacklustre when the cards you want have been played and you need to play out the rest to be able to restore your hand. I am not sure about this one. Possibly one for the trade pile.

We did have to set a new rule that we only play early in the game night because we will play game after game and ignore time altogether.

This is a quick asymmetrical 2-player abstract-ish type game.  The theme seems exciting but the game play was a little blah for me.  Interesting play with some out guess your opponent but can feel same-y from game to game.  Feels like the raptors are more powerful than the scientists but this is after only four plays.  Overall, it was just ok for me.

Very asymmetrical 1v1. Try to steal a raptors babies and see what she does next, great plan. Very unique game play I haven't played anything remotely similar. I love mauling scientists and feeding there entrails to my spawn such a fun game.

RATING: 7.5
Very fast paced, strategic game. Nice balance, seen equal victories with both scientists and raptors. It's not necessarily the cards you play, but how you play them that will give you the victory-- it can really become a bluffing/guessing game! Rating will likely go up with more plays. Sleeved

I've play only two test games at Essen Spiel. And in both game we were mistaken about some rule. Because this game is asymmetric there are a lot of rules to take into concern. Therefore I weight this game "3" of "5". However after the rules are 100% clear to both players the game starts to be challenging and fun, I guess.

A game of trying to anticipate what your opponent will do and pick your action to take advantage of that. Great asymmetry, great theme, lots of fun.

However, can be very confrontational and brutal. My girlfriend didn't want to play games with me for awhile after playing this against me and me pretty effectively outguessing her every move and crushing her. Not recommended to play against people who don't like confrontational games.

Raptor was quite surprising for me because the game and theme seem ridiculous. But the card play is just fantastic. I love the quasi-bluffing aspect along with trying to deduce what your opponent might be playing. I actually haven't had many sessions with this game, but each time this hits the table, it ends up going a couple of plays. It sets up quickly, plays quickly, and gives you a full experience. This is a standout effort for Team Bruno and is definitely one of my favorite titles. I recommend it if you're looking for something specifically for two players.

Really nice little 2-player game with asymmetrical player powers. The mechanism where you both play cards face down and the lowest card uses it's face ability and the highest card gives their owning player action points equal to the difference of their values is really clever and fun and leads to some bluffing and funny situations.

This very much has the feel of chess, as you really are moving a bunch of rooks around the board. The cards add for a little randomness and also make you think about what your opponent is going to play, as the power of your card depends on what they play. While it's not super amazing, I definitely could have it in my regular 2-player rotation. At least for novice players, the scientists are hard to play with, but perhaps with experience, the sides get more balanced.

I held off rating this game for a long time because I know my criticisms are very personal and unlikely to be useful to many people. However, something something algorithm blah blah other site features yadda yadda benefits, etc., and here I am, giving it a 4.

I spent the entire game (as the raptors) stressed out. "They're not killing the dinosaurs," my husband kept saying. "They're capturing them humanely." "And then I'm humanely killing the 'researchers' who are just trying to peacefully study me?" Nah.

Clearly I'm too soft-hearted and too interested in game theme over mechanics to enjoy this game. I do admire the mechanics; I just prefer them in Mission: Red Planet. My husband really liked it (so we'll let his rating counter mine), so I've charged him with finding a believable way to re-theme it that I will enjoy. Fun-loving paintball game between dinosaurs and their human friends? I don't know...

One of my favorite 2 player games I've played. Relatively light, but somehow still very tactical. There's randomness, but it's the right kind of randomness. Like you feel like you have a lot of control over your odds. When you miscalculate it's more likely to make you laugh than get mad.

However, when you lose in this game it can be really disheartening for some reason. Also a weirdly aggressive game, and can get a little mean. Just something to keep in mind, definitely not for everyone.

After 8 plays I rate this an 8.  It's a wonderful game of head's up action.  You have a sort of bidding system that drives the game which is really cool because the values shift around.  Sometimes you want the action, sometimes the action points.  It's a neat balance.

The game loses 1 point for the fiddliness of the mother losing movement points and not being able to wake a sleeping/frightened character the turn it happens.  Minor, but still slightly annoying.

Fun little two-player game. I absolutely love the asymmetrical roles, which thus far feel pretty balanced. Component quality is fantastic, especially all the different scientist standees. The modular game board and deck shuffling means there's always a nice bit of variation, but I do wonder about the staying power of this game over many plays. It's super-fun though, and has that tense 'head-to-head' feeling that 7 Wonders Duel does so well.

Near perfect two player game. Great deduction mechanism which helps to mitigate luck of the draw. Lovely modular tiles to keep replayability interesting. I wasn't terribly intrigued initially due to the theme, but my wife and I have really taken to the game and routinely laugh during the more tense moments of the game. This is absolutely a "one more game" type of game for us. May bump up to 10 over time. Probably favorite "new to us" game of 2016.

RATING: 6
This was an amusing little asymmetric game where one person plays as a Raptor protecting her babies and the other player controls scientists trying to kill/study the raptors.  Theme win.  The game works by players simultaneously playing cards with an action and a number.  The lower numbered card gets to take the printed action while the higher numbered card gets to take general actions equal to the difference.  It felt pretty random because 6 vs 7 is totally different than 7 vs 6, and a 1 v 9 could practically be instant game over.  So, not the most strategic game ever, but good for what it is as a quick, 2 player game with a fun theme.

RATING: 7
Seems like a solid two-player game. It feels like playing a series of Braverats rounds, with a board element.

The luck of the draw can be significant, but it wasn't as much of a problem as I anticipated. Sometimes you need just the right card and you don't get it, but overall it seems to affect both players about the same.

I'm also not so sure about that balance. Playing the Raptor side definitely takes a lot more skill, and even then I'm not sure how often they can pull out a win. Maybe more experience could prove to be more even.

Overall, a fun game. Rating could change with more plays.

Update: After another play, I really like the gameplay here. I'm still skeptical about the balance of the raptor player, though. I would be interested to hear strategies from people who have won multiple times as the raptor player against experienced players.

Rating could go up if we get a handle on better raptor strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I still think the raptor is far more difficult to play than the scientists.  With that being said, it's a fun challenge and a strong theme.  Would recommend, and I always want to play to prove myself as a raptor.

Update: The more I play, the more I feel like I'm unlocking the Raptor's potential strengths.  Perhaps my opinion will swing back at some point, but right now I feel really good about playing as the Raptor.

2 player games. They are extremely hit or miss for me.  I like to have them in my collection so I have games that are easily played with my girlfriend. Games designed specifically for 2 players however can tend to be dry. Often times they wind up being very much abstract games even if they have been skinned with a theme. Sometimes however you get a real game nestled in there that doesn't really feel like columns, and rows, and colors, and numbers. A couple of my favorite 2 player games that are more than just quick time killers are Targi, and Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small. Raptor jumps right into this list for me.

 Really root for the Raptors no matter who I'm playing and it almost always end with a sudden and unsatisfying Scientist victory. On the bright side that usually leads to immediately playing again and hopefully it'll level out to more balanced when i get better with the raptors. 

Edited the review and added a star as well because lo and behold it balanced out massively once i mastered the raptors cards.

A nice asymetric two player game. The card mechanism is fun and adds tension and bluffing (cards are numbered 1-9 and played simultaniously, lower number gets the special action, higher the difference of the number as action points). In the first games balance seemed a little skewed towards the scientists but maybe that will change in later plays.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Very cool theme, I like the asymmetric game play. Game is VERY tense, the simultaneous action makes for some stressful situation when you play a card 1 value less than your opponent. Can be a bit luck based (for better or worse) with the cards you draw. I'm no expert but I feel the RNG in this game is not for the better, sometimes RNG can lead to drama but in this game it feels kind of bad.
Overall a cool concept that doesn't hit the table for me anymore because its too stressful.

Due to modular board and card draw, every game represents new challenges.

I might have been a bit too over hyped for this game.  It was fun, I enjoyed the mind games involved with the card play.  Of course I absolutely LOVE the theme.  It plays more like an abstract than I thought... which is funny to say, of course I was expecting tactical play, it just feels a bit more mechanical than I was expecting.   It has a very neat eb and flow though that naturally derives from the card play system.   You're constantly trying to edge out one of the win conditions while keeping your opponent's in check.

I really enjoy the asymmetry between the raptor team and the scientist team, as well as the mechanic of "lower card goes first and gets a special action; higher card gets action points based on the difference between the card values". I also like that each side has two ways to win. When you factor in the modular board pieces, you end up with a pretty insane level of replayability.

The production quality of this game is superb, particularly the scientist minis (not sure what that one running scientist with the briefcase is doing, though...). In our first 15 or so plays of the game, it seemed quite difficult to win as the raptor. However, now that we have internalized all of the rules, the game feels much more balanced, and the outcome typically depends on the timing of the card draws more than anything else. When you do pull off a raptor victory, it is glorious.

Raptor completely surprised me. It‚Äôs a two player, asymmetric, card game with a board where one player represents the scientists and the other side is a momma raptor with her five baby raptors. The scientists are trying to either capture three baby raptors or tranquilize the momma raptor five times (all for science of course). While that‚Äôs happening, momma raptor is trying to help her babies escape (maybe eating a scientist or two along the way). Each turn you have a hand of three cards from a deck of nine cards number 1-9. Each card has a number and an action. Both cards are revealed simultaneously and the low card‚Äôs action happen while the person who played the high card gets a number of actions equal to the difference between their card and their opponent‚Äôs card.

The game had a lot of tough decisions with a real economy of rules, choices, and pieces. The fact that it‚Äôs a 30 minute (or less) game doesn‚Äôt hurt matters either. In my mind, this game is nearly as good as 7 Wonders: Duel and Battle Line for short two player games (good for the new parent crowd).

Highly recommended.

Asymmetric two player family game where the scientists are trying to capture the mama and baby raptors with card driven grid movement. The interesting and distinctive mechanic is the trick taking and card play strategy. Win the trick with the lowest value card to gain the special ability or lose the trick and get the difference between played card values as action points. Very cool strategy incentive to predict opponent card value that I haven't played with before.  Raptor mom moves will strike fear. Card abilities for scientists and raptor mom can be game changers.

Only played it once for now. It has a very nice balance between being easy to learn, but still offering interesting choices. It's a fun theme as well.

All in all a very streamlined and fun 2 player game.

Most accessible game I have I think, in that it is easy to set up, can be quick to play, easy to teach/learn, and getting into the theme has been a piece of cake. 

'Raptor' plays out like a hunting scene in a dinosaur movie with the suspense, tension, and fun that comes with it. A real joy to play.

Awesome two player game. Excellent artwork and very strategic for what is in essence a very simple game. Easy rules, but tough decisions. The way it should be...

Fun 2p game with simultaneous action selection.  Didn't care for it after the first play, but the second play was MUCH better since it played quicker once we both understood what the cards did.  Not far and away better than other 2p-only games we own, but probably deserves a spot in the rotation.

Had one session of this and it hasn't hit the table since. Big box for a filler - will need to play this more to justify keeping it.

Fun to play 2-player game but a little bit disappointed that the game is a quiet unbalanced, the scientist will win most of the time

Nice 2-p game. Feels a bit one-sided at times depending on how the game goes for the opponents, e.g. once the game leans towards you then it's hard for your opponent to come back. A shame they had to duplicate each card ability instead of having unique effects, but overall a solid game.

Real strategy for two players! If you do a Bad move, your situation can change really Quick from good to Bad... The card system is well balance and gives you you the opportunity to try to guessing which card your opponent will play!

Raptor lives up to the hype. It's the most fun I've had with an asymmetrical strategy game. Each side (raptors and scientists) plays completely differently. I've seen several different strategies pay off, and neither side or strategy has a clear advantage. Very fun.

I can see a good game here but my initial rating is based on unlucky draws which ended the game prematurely. I like alot of the mechanisms and the theme.

This is a really fun and exciting game.  We have found that the advantage can quickly shift between the players, several times during  the game, and just when you think that you've won, it is snatched away from you.

I thought this was a very clever, very tense game in my first few plays. And it can be. But it can also be a tedious tug-of-war of incremental gains and losses that overstays its welcome by far.

Great theme, spatial intelligence required. Fun card-play. My better half likes it as a Hey That's My Fish with a theme. For me a little bit too short and shallow, but great for what it is. Certainly better usage of action selection than Citadel for my money.

Feines kleines Zweipersonenspiel, das mehr taktischen Tiefgang bietet, als man zuerst denkt.

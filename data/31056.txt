A nice idea is ruined by too complicated rules for a game that should be fast and intense.

Indeed, it is a really neat idea to add some strategy and tactics to good old Tiddlywinks. Unfortunately with its over complicated rules Micro Mutants turns out to play really really slow. By slow I mean that often you have to wait for your next turn more than 15 seconds sometimes even minutes. Another thing is that you need a proper playing mat to make the pieces fly. The whole experience is dependent on the surface you are playing on.

RATING: 10
For me, boardgame perfection.  Skill-driven dexterity game....but with a touch of chaos as your luck varies with each shot;  sometimes you'll make the most amazing cross-board shot, and sometimes you'll fumble hitting the enemy adjacent to you.  Easy enough for my 4-yo that he can compete with his brothers and his parent, and just enough complexity and variety to keep it interesting.  Flawless!

Having played this so many times, I think the designers did an admirable job of balancing the armies.  My 12-yo won't play unless he's the blue army (whatever they're called), and sometimes it seems he's able to use their special abilities to just mop up the opposition.  And yet, inevitably, the games either play very close to the end or wind up featuring these dramatic momentum shifts;  either way, it's the kind of fun that defines boardgaming for me!!

Very fun game, especially if you get the setup right.  The bugs just fly~~ flip~~ and it's quite cool :)

The new version of one of our All-Time Favourites X-Bugs! The new version is streamlined and simplified. They have reduced the number of bugs and did change the rules a little bit to the lighter side. In addition they reduced the overall playing time. A good thing for such a lighthearted funny game.
But don't be fooled! There are hidden strategies lurking around, especially in Multi-Player games.

The game I've always been looking for, before I even knew what it was I liked in a game.

As I've played games, I came to realized that I love: 
-FUN games most of all
-games that cause the players to High-Five and congratulate each other on good moves 
-Battle games without charts, and never ending dice resolutions
-Simple, yet engaging rules
-Strategic games that reward the thinkers without the AP factor and just enough luck mixed in that if you happen to do an awesome move (but potentially cruel), you won't feel bad about 'being mean' to that person.   
-replay-ability
-flexible game duration time
-Potential for the game to grow with advanced rules and expansions (even though I'm a gaming on a tight budget) :-)
-Minimal set-up/take-down time
-And on and on

Found this at a game store on sale. I thought it would be fun to play with the kids, so I bought it. Tried it out when I got home and don't think it really fits my kids that great.

But my wife and I love it! First of all, I love games that have different armies with different powers (Neuroshima Hex, Blue Moon, Manouevre). I also love dexterity games like Crokinole that involve a skill (that is completely useless in every other part of life) that you can actually practice at and get good at. Plus the whole look and feel of the game is completely silly, which makes it fun for us. For example, the thing with throwing the asteroids onto the field to blow up the bugs is just fun and silly. We love it.

Combat tiddley-winks, complete with supply rules. I'd actually like to play a little more often: it's a fun filler game, which unfortunately lacks the portability you really want in a filler.

Fun game!  Skill, strategy, and luck are needed.  Sometimes there's just no telling where these things will bounce, but that's part of the fun!  A good playing surface is a must; not too soft that you can't get any distance, but not too hard that you can't get height.  I have the Flyborgs and the USArthropod set.  It seems as if the Arthropods are a little weaker than the Flyborgs, and that there is a slight balance problem.  Usually I give the inexperienced played the Flyborgs though, so it evens out in the end.  Overall, a fun game that I would enjoy playing any time!

Advanced tiddly winks! A nifty little game, I just wish it was littler so it would finish up faster, because the powers and the reminder of my youth are fun, but it is still at it's heart tiddly winks, and so not very deep. It last too long for being this shallow.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Brilliant. 

The variety of ways to use the extra power cards, terrain, different base types etc make the game extremely customisable and very easy to "tweak" (if for example you want to play a four player game with some first-time players quickly or if you want to shake things up a bit with a regular opponent).

The game contains just the right mix of powers and abilities to distinguish the different forces without slowing the game down. 

The creases on the game mat are a little annoying but it really isnt something worth getting too worried about, it plays fine with it.

Micro Mutants is absolutely worth owning and playing.  While I wont play MME every day the short duration of play time and massive fun factor means that it will keep coming off the shelf for a long time.  Is it the best game ever? Probably not, but it does fill its niche as well as any other game out there.

The quality of the playing mat is poor....ours was easily punctured with routine play, but I do like the idea of creating a more distinct playing area than the X-Bugs game had.

The updates to the rules from X-Bugs all seem to be improvements. Its nice to get all 4 armies in the same box, rather than having to buy separately. 

This is such a fantastically fun, and under-rated dexterity game. Its the #1 go-to game for me to play with my son, since he was 5...and he's now nearly 8.

Fun dexterity battle game I bought for my 8 y.o. son to enjoy and as a bonus, my 4 y.o. daughter loves it too!  The four armies each have their own strengths and weaknesses which adds to the fun and getting the hang of flipping the winks doesn't take nearly as long as I thought it would (a tablecloth or some other thin padding beneath the felt helps a lot - without it you can't get enough height on the flips.  The gaming table surface from Boards and Bits is an ideal surface for this game - a highly recommended purchase). Felt mat is just OK -- creases can be a bit of a hassle -- but ironing flattens it out just fine.  Have only tried the 2 player basic game so far.
Edit:  I have to bump up the ratings on this one because my kids are absolutely nuts about this game and won't stop playing.  Also, finally got to the advanced game which definitely improves things.  We really like the wormholes and the ability to use resources to purchase special abilities.
4 player game is really really fun!

Played our first game of this tonight.  We played the 'basic' rules and enjoyed the game.  My two sons really liked this game.  The variable player powers mixed with the tiddlywinks action was a big hit.   Gonna rate this a 7 for now.  It may go up with subsequent plays and use of the advanced rules.

For my wife and I, the game felt a bit long, perhaps, but we enjoyed it.

Rated after one (recent) play -- I have the original X-Bugs and hadn't played in six years or so. It's a fun game -- some interesting choices, the die rolls add randomness but in this game they fit. One of the biggest challenges is hitting the consistent "medium putt." I suspect that if I practiced more I could get decent at it -- but I'm not motivated to practice!

Concerne la version VF éditée par Darwin Project

Quelle découverte ce petit jeu qui réussit l’improbable synthèse entre le traditionnel jeu de puce et le wargame ! Point de bol ici, chaque joueur est à la tête d’une armée d’insectes mutants qui ont parfois des pouvoirs particuliers, certains rejouent deux fois, d’autres transportent des insectes ou encore présentent une face immortelle. Le but est d’éliminer les deux bases adverses et accessoirement les insectes qui vous menacent. A votre tour vous lancez deux dés qui vous imposent quel type d’insecte vous déplacez ce tour ci à l’aide d’un propulseur. Si votre insecte retombe sur un insecte adverse celui ci meurt immédiatement, si c’est sur la base adverse celle ci est retournée sur sa face affaiblie et la prochaine fois elle sera éliminée. Lorsque vous avez éliminé au moins un insecte dans votre tour de jeu vous pouvez en déplacer un autre qui n’a pas été déplacé. Si au moins un de vos dés présente un insecte que vous n’avez plus du tout, vous placez un de ses insectes de la défausse prés d’une de vos base en guise de renfort.

Mon opinion

Et voilà comment on remet au goût du jour un jeu vieillot auquel tout le monde a joué. C’est typiquement le jeu qui attire le monde non joueur jeune ou vieux, il est simplement impossible de résister à l’appel des puces mutantes. Le jeu est léger, rapide et suscite la bonne humeur, ici les grandes stratégies sont remplacées par des grandes rigolades pour notre plus grand bien. Le jeu demande un peu de pratique car d’une part il existe plusieurs formats de puce (rectangle, grand disque, petit disque) et d’autre part la nature du terrain est extrêmement importante. Il est nécessaire d’avoir un terrain lisse et légèrement élastique, après plusieurs essais j’ai finalement opté pour un revêtement de sol en matière plastique. Attention, les règles sont claires: le moindre mouvement de puce, meme involontaire, est pris en compte: rien de tel pour avoir la main qui tremble.
La technique s’affine avec la pratique mais le caractère imprévisible des sauts fait de micro mutants le premier jeu de puce sans bol mais où il faut en avoir un peu pour gagner.

En plus de l’original italien il existe une version américaine appelée X-bugs de ce jeu et une version française. Aucune version n’est parfaitement identique surtout dans la répartition des insectes et il me semble qu’elles nécessitent toutes certains ajustements. Il y a des différences notables entre la règle française et les deux autres règles :


Version française
Deux dés et deux bases par joueur.
Lorsque vous avez éliminé une base adverse vous éliminez un insecte adverse.

Version américaine
Trois dés et trois bases par joueur. Les bases ont des pouvoirs spéciaux.
Lorsque vous avez éliminé une base adverse vous éliminez deux insectes et supprimez un dé à votre adversaire.
Vous avez la possibilité de recharger vos bases en capturant des ressources disséminées sur le terrain. En dépensant deux ressources vos rechargez une de vos bases.

C’est dommage que l’éditeur français n’ait pas mis autant de matériel que dans les autres versions du jeu. Qu’il juge que les règles méritent certains ajustements est une chose mais je pense qu’il aurait pu proposer une variante, laisser le choix aux joueurs d’utiliser la règle qu’ils veulent et d’oublier les économies de bout de chandelles en supprimant des puces (20 € la boite tout de même en 2003). Je me réjouis de la venue de nouveaux éditeurs en France et j’espère qu’il vont réussir, mais qui peut le plus peut le moins, aussi dans le cas de Micro Mutants, je vous conseille d’acheter la version américaine.

A ce jour deux boites sont sorties en version française, dans la première Usatropodes / Exoborgs dans la deuxième Russopteres / Arachnoïdes.
Les Exoborgs sont vraiment forts, notamment les répulsors (x3) qui permettent de faire reculer l’insecte adverse le plus proche. Redoutable en défense et à placer en priorité prés des bases pour contraindre l’adversaire à des tirs éloignés.
Pour les éliminer utilisez un insecte sur une face où il n’est plus capturable (béret vert Usatropodes), ou éliminez une base et choisissez un répulsor comme insecte à éliminer.
Les guerrières (x4) si elles sont capturées dard face visible, éliminent l’insecte attaquant. Là aussi c’est douloureux d’autant que la reine (x1) si elle est sur sa face spéciale à le pouvoir de retourner un des insectes.
Le centurion lorsqu’il est sur sa face spéciale n’est éliminé que s’il est attaqué par deux insectes en même temps (autant dire jamais) !

Les Usatropodes sont sympas avec des caractéristiques équilibrées, tir (bazooka x2), double mouvement (chasseur x3), face immortelle (béret vert x1).

Les Russoptères sont très intéressants à jouer, les ouvriers (x4) ont la propriété suivante : il est possible d’en déplacer deux par dé. Probabilité de sortie d’un ouvrier : 44%, de deux ouvriers : 11% (si vous avez encore tous vos ouvriers cela fait quatre mouvement durant votre tour de jeu !).
Le saboteur (x2) sur sa face spéciale ne peut être capturé mais il ne peut que s’attaquer aux bases.

Les Arachnoïdes sont moins intéressants surtout si on manque d’adresse. Leur point fort c’est que l’on peut multiplier les actions dans le tour, déplacement répété, tir… Le prédateur est mon préféré il se déplace tant qu’il mange, bien placé il peut faire un méchant carnage mais malheureusement c’est une puce rectangulaire difficile à maîtriser. Leur point faible: les larves (x3) qui restent en attente et que l’on peut remplacer par un pion précédemment éliminé une fois tuées, mais du coup le joueur est souvent en infériorité numérique.

Probabilité de sortie (version française)
Il y a douze insectes par équipe, chaque insecte est représente par une face d’un dé, s’il y a plusieurs insectes semblables nous allons les retrouver répartis au mieux sur les deux dés. Par exemple il y a trois larves que l’on retrouve sur deux faces du premier dé et une face du second.
Si un insecte est représenté une seule fois la probabilité de sortie est de 17%.
Si un insecte est représenté deux fois la probabilité de sortie une fois est de 28%, deux fois : 3%.
Si un insecte est représenté trois fois la probabilité de sortie une fois est de 39%, deux fois : 6%.
Si un insecte est représenté quatre fois la probabilité de sortie une fois est de 44%, deux fois : 11%.

However, the improved art for the USArthropods is very nice, indeed.  I might borrow those winks for X-Bugs.  Plus, it is a good, inexpensive option for those that do not want to track down the older sets.

It's a terrible shame that the expansion is unlikely to be published.  =(

I see how this game could be entertaining if it lasted 20 minutes... but m first play lasted over an hour and a half.

With a hard table, little skill and a mat with creases, Doing any actual scoring seems complicated. I see how someone that can finish a game of this in 8 turns or so might find it fun, but with people with no skill, it's just terrible, and everyone starts wishing for the end.

The enjoyability of the game really has a lot to do with the playing surface, a table that is too hard or a layer that is too springy on top can affect the flicking action to where it's really not so fun.

I will definitely try this game again and experiment with different surfaces until we find one that we like best.

Quick and fun dexterity game. The armies are varied and the scenarios are creative. The mat comes folded into four pieces which makes for annoying creases. I can't think of any way to solve this problem without storing the map separately. The only other issue is that three of the teams seem to be balanced while the American team seems grossly overpowered in comparison. We've given that team to new players to get around this. The game plays just as well with 5-8 players as it does for 2-4. To play 5+ just put 2 players on a team (each player taking one of the two shots for their team per turn). Overall I've been surprised by how much fun this game can be. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
For me, two player games often lack interest because you don't get the same amount of social interaction. The skill aspects of this tiddlywinks based battle game is enough to maintain my interest, and the cards/powers are silly enough to keep it as light fun.

Multiplayer war game played with tiddlywinks on a 70 cm square field! Special dice are use to determine which 2 units may be moved (by flipping) each turn. Most units have special abilities, such as extra moves, or shooting projectiles. If you land on an opponents' unit or base it is eliminated. You have to eliminate your opponents' bases to win. Very fun once you get the hang of the rules, and more strategic than you'd think for a dexterity game!

Totally awesome mix of dexterity, strategy and silliness. It's got some good planning and thought involved, but its random enough and most importantly quick enough, that seeing your plans blow up in your face is half the fun. Really fast turns and streamlined rules keep the energy way up for the whole game too which is great.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It seems to be all offense because there's no points for killing units, only bases. Therefore, the best strategy is to ignore the defense of your bases and simply go all out on the attack. I would have liked some motivation to defend my bases. Also, why is movement determined by a die? I hate that.

Otherwise fun game.

MME is light hearted and great fun. Not for the strategic or those who hate luck based games though- as this really is one of those where you can get lucky and win the game in a single move.

Basically, tiddleywinks put to rules, with cool bits. Play it with fun people, trash talk, and it's a blast. The five different armies have varying abilities and strengths, which makes it more interesting. A half-point bonus for fun factor and very 'tight' bits, and for being one of those games that I wish I'd thought of. 

Purchased via BGG, October 2008. My son Trevor rated it a 10 when he was 10 years old (10-27-09).

Soooo Awesome! A little bug war with fantastic bits! This game is definitely worth playing...I was skeptical upon purchasing it...but no more! Flip your bugs into the air and have them land on an opponents bug or enemy base. All bugs have unique features or powers. Also each bug species has completely different stats! This makes it very interesting and creates endless variety of game play!

It really is just tiddlywinks, trying to land on opponents pieces and take them out of the game. Your pieces come in different shapes and sizes, and each piece has a unique power, which might activate depending on which side is showing (eg can't be captured, or get a free flick). That might be the attraction of the game. On a turn you roll two dice and whichever character gets rolled, that's what you flick. Land on (ie capture) something and you get an extra move. Capture opponent's bases to win. Despite the "coolness" of having special powers, in the end it has all the same frustrations of standard Tiddlywinks (I imagine anyway, given how much energy I've put into playing Tiddlywinks in my life) - it's a skill game, and if you're not good at flicking those pieces, it's not much fun. And if you're good, well, you're still just flicking stuff around the table with some limited cheer/groan factor.

RATING: 8.5
Excellent combination of tiddlywinks and a miniatures/battle game. Beyond the obvious skill that you can develop in actually shooting the bugs around, there also appears to be plenty of scope to develop unique tactics for each of the different armies.

The included 4 armies should provide for plenty of variety with all the combinations possible, and the (nicely done) rulebook allows easy customisation of game complexity by including basic, advanced and optional rules.

The components aren't bad, but applying all those stickers can be tiresome - although it's worth taking your time to get them all centred properly.

WARNING: Included play mat is not thick enough - need to place over a tablecloth or replace with e.g. felt 

NOTE: Highly likely to be (at least 4) expansion armies released - will these be together as one set or split over several?

Compared to X-Bugs, This game is pared down and more streamlined while having more variants provided as well.

It only comes with 2 dice per army and each army has lost one unit type from the previous edition.  This is somewhat remedied by a greater variety in special powers provided by the bases.

The mat that comes with it is garbage.  I recommend never using it.

This is fun, and it's totally a game of skill too! A good shot will kill a bug, no matter how the dice roll. Would've loved to see this expanded with more armies (though there are fan created ones). My opponents weren't as into it, so I let it go.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Being a dexterity game, it's "love it or hate it" - some simply don't like games where you have to "flick" your pieces, allowing physics to dictate the success of your play. 

As for the game, all the races seem balanced for the most part - nothing apparently wrong to me at least. There's luck in the die rolls but the flicking is totally skill based... a skill that some may consider not too valuable but a skill nevertheless.

It's okay with 2 players, fun with 3, but easily plays best with 4 - in fact, it's even better with teams.

[b]Update:[/b] My skills in flicking units are evidently lacking... and so it is with all the people I have tried playing this game with since my initial comments. Games can go quite long simply because players are incapable of capturing opponents. Sadly, this game which showed some fun promise at first has turned sour. I feel compelled to lower my initial rating of 7 to a 6.

Fun tiddlywinks army game. Each piece has different attack abilities and opponents are trying to flick pieces to destroy enemy bases and/or pieces.

Colourful art and pieces. Hilarious abilities and wheeling and dealing in a 4-player game makes this a hoot. If you dislike player elimination, avoid. Runs a touching with 4 players. Definitely a game that rewards experience.

The mat doesn't work on all surfaces. Putting a cloth or blank underneath helps.

I had high hopes for this, based on articles here and ratings by my geekbuddies. What I was looking for was something that the non-gamers in my family would enjoy (flipping disks) yet would still be interesting to me (strategy elements).

Unfortunately, when we tried it nothing clicked for any of us. None of us had enough skill to be accurate with the flips, so the whole game meandered randomly until we eventually ended it by mutual consent. Maybe the stars weren't aligned on that day, or maybe it was just us, but I'll have a very tough time getting them to give it another shot. Not one of them saw any promise in it.

I can see where it might work, if we developed better skills, but that would be a lot of up front time spent with no assurance of a payoff. If we want accessible dexterity games, we have Elk Fest and Tumblin' Dice. If we want depth of skill, we have Carrom. If we want a bit of strategy in the mix, I'd probably have a look at Catacombs.

[FFG 'Micro Mutant' 08 edition] {Bugs, War; dexterity, player-elimination, dice-rolling, fighting, variable-player-power; optimal 2 / 2 teams}  {Basic game 6.5; Advanced Game 6.5} Micro Mutants is a fun and tactical dexterity game.  Sometimes, a result is unexpected.  After several games, players can master certain basic skills to manipulate the pawns, and the game becomes more interesting.  However, a game may drag if players are too defensive.  So, play with aggressive and fun players :)

The components of FFG edition, IMHO, are better than SJGames.

This game is a blast! Even though it uses tiddly winks in basic mechanics, it's NOT TIDDLY WINKS! 

It's light fun, highly competitive, and has lots of cheering over good shots, ooohing over close misses, etc. Kids love this game! (So do the adults, even if they won't admit it -- well, I'm an adult and I love it)

It's a great head-to-head game for 2 players. 3 players is great, but you have to be careful about the gang-up factor. 4 players I haven't done but would probably eliminate the ganging up a bit. BUT, it's quick and fun, even if you don't win.

This is pure and simple - combat tiddly winks. Each army is slightly different, which keeps things interesting. Basically you try and flip your pieces onto the enemy pieces. If your bug/piece ends up on its special side, you get some sort of bonus or power or whatever. Simple fun.

While this is labeleed as a dexterity game it is actually not, at least not more so than physical act of throwing dice is: the bug can land almost anywhere regardless of time and skill used to move it - it can go under or it can go on top, no chance knowing how it's going to turn out. Harmless game.

It sure was fun flicking the bugs everywhere. Cool dexterity game for sure. It can get a little frustrating when you can't hit anything though, lol.

I can barely get the damn bugs to flip, let alone shoot them into enemy territory. Bah!




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5
Flickability - 0


Overall - 1

Damn who'd have thought they would go and fix X-Bugs? Hehehehe this game is fun, hate to say it but I'm so happy to have it in my collection.

Interesting take on Tiddlywinks!  I like the special units, winning conditions and of course the dexterity aspect of the game.  I've been playing with my 7 yr old, but I think it would be a fun beer and pretzel game for adults too.

As much as we wanted this game to work, it just performs poorly.  The only game that sucked worse than this because of performance was Penguins (absolutely unplayable).

Tiddly Winks with a theme, and possibly some strategy.

A dexterity war game. Super fun. You can't take it too seriously but it is possible to get skilled at it.

This is probably the most obvious way to implement tiddly winks as a miniatures game. Even though the system isn't particularly clever it's still a lot of fun. It's refreshing to play a silly dexterity combat game after a thoughtful strategy game.

It might be dumb, but it's exactly the right amount of time for what it is.  The play mat isn't particularly good -- better to probably get a roll-out felt mat if you want to play this.  As far as silly, late-night dexterity games, this is a good entry in the genre.

Tiddlywinks on a battlefield.   I think the advanced game might add some more strategy.  Fun for the right crowd.

the Italian name for "Tiddlywinks" is "il gioco della pulce", which means "the game of the flea"; updated version of X-Bugs (Italian)

OMG, this game is soooo fun! Just one serious play so far but I see a lot more games coming. One of those games you can play while drinking beer and really have fun. My first dexterity game and a great one. Glad I bought it on sale.

Too small to be seen, alien insects invaded Earth long ago. Now they're ready to fight for world domination. Humanity's last hope lies in the forces they created to fight back on the aliens' own microscopic battlefield. Field your army of genetically engineered bugs and confront your enemy. Will you fight for the ferocious aliens or brave terrans? Each race features amazing powers, but you will also need skill to achieve victory.

Micro Mutants is a revolutionary game that combines skill, strategy, and luck in a quick and exciting way. Players roll dice, flip Micro Mutants like tiddlywinks, and wield powerful special abilities!

Micro Mutants is the new version of the game previously released as X-Bugs. This new version is a complete game for 2 to 4 players age 10+, and includes revised and improved rules (with basic, advanced and multi-player rules); templates for special terrains; a printed cloth-like playmat; reference cards for Bugs and Projectiles and the all new Evolution cards.

Tiddlywinks with variable player powers. Great family game or casual filler for gamers.

As much as I gain tremendous satisfaction from playing "serious" games, I will never fail to shout in triumph when I cover your bug/base with my cleverly-shot insect aggressor.

This game has come to serve as a real litmus test for me.  If Micro Mutants causes you to groan, cheer, and grin wildly, then you're the kind of person who I want to game with regularly.

Oh, and the special powers and terrain effects are just awesome.

Silly little dexterity game.  Basic and advanced play are options for 2 to 4 players.  I like it quite a bit.  My only concern is for the possibility of losing pieces.  They are small and light and can easily fly off of the table during play.

My favourite dexterity game. All the bugs play differently and are very flavourful. Skill, strategy and luck required to do well. Excellent game.

Wow. What a great new edition. The rules are clarified nicely, and the new components look great. The mat shows some creasing, but it nice and portable. Love the fact that you get four armies in the core game. Tons of replay value, and fortunately, I haven't had one of the "shooter" disks break on me yet, which was a big problem I had with the old SJG version.

This is an exceptionally easy to teach two player deduction game. It's works well as a filler as long as the two players are not taking it too seriously. Warning, if the killer figures out who the detective is then the detective has effectively lost. It's far too easy to just get stuck in a stalemate loop after that.

Fun, straightforward deduction card game from one of the best designers and publishers in the business. Cool artwork, and multiple modes in the box. Different modes do share some mechanics, but it's pretty sweet that Talton gets so much use out of the same card components.

2 player deduction with the players having completely asymmetrical roles. Try to catch the murderer or catch the police by carefully moving the columns and rows of cards. Super simple. We just play the base version as I think the other 3 play options add a little too much complication to what is supposed to be an incredibly simple game.

A deduction game with cards only that was given out for free at BGG.con 2013.  I've played the basic game with my wife (once each as the thief/killer).  I wouldn't mind trying the other games... though I'll probably need a different opponent.  A decent game that I'd play more.

RATING: 3
[i]Jugado en BoardGameArena[/i]

De los 6 modos de juego, sólo he jugado el de "Killer vs Inspector", y básicamente está roto. El jugador que juega que tiene el rol de "Killer" tiene demasiada ventaja por sobre el "Inspector" ya que puede ir cambiando de rol de forma indefinida, simplemente con que encuentre al inspector ya le es suficiente para que le toque una carta al lado de él y matarlo en el primer turno.

Precisa un pequeño arreglo, la idea en si no es mala (en este modo de juego), pero por el momento queda así.

[b]Nota - Killer vs Inspector:[/b] 3 (23/7/2015)

RATING: 9
A quick, fun game of asymmetric deduction. My wife took to the game quickly, and our first night out played 8 or so games. It's very different playing killer or inspector, and while the game isn't complex the strategy can get very cognitive. There is a chance of some lucky wins/losses (such as the first kill being the inspectors identity), but it's quick to play and set up again so the sour feeling is quickly gone as you are soon well into the next game. A filler (time wise) with some meat on its bones.

The game seems like it should be great, with real opportunity to figure out who the killer is, rising tension as they get closer to victory, but their identity becomes easier and easier to suss, however, the end of the game always feels anti-climactic. Like as if it comes out of nowhere (if the killer is caught).

I think I've pretty much solved the game, and unfortunately the best strategy for the investigator is to try to end the game early. So to enjoy the game more, you need to play suboptimally. Bleh. This really is a fine game when you first get into it though, especially for the price.

The concept of this game is amazing, and the theme does an excellent job of shining through. You really feel the pressure from the other player, and the deduction (while not complex) is quite fun! This is a very light game (just a simple standard card deck size), but the reason I could not give this a 7+ was that many of the games can hit a wall near the end of play. One of the players, usually the inspector, always has a tougher job, and a role that is less forgiving. This can cause games to end with forfeits all too often as you can do nothing if the killer determines the investigator's identity. All that said, it is still a very fun game, especially considering the portability and quick play time (10-20 minutes).

RATING: 8
A great deduction and bluffing game where the core game involves a 5x5 grid of cards where one person plays the killer who needs to kill fourteen victims or the other player, the inspector. The inspector needs to catch the killer, but both players identities are hidden and the killer can change identities as an action. Sometimes can result in the killer finding the inspector on the first or second turn, but fortunately games are quick enough that it's not an issue for me.

The Black Box edition comes with five additional game modes (I'm not sure how many the original edition come with) and I've only had the opportunity to play Hitman vs Sleuth, which is a very interesting variant on the core game. Other game modes appear to be a lot more different.

Ol' Boy is a good boy unless he's viciously murdering victims left, right and centre. Then he's a bad boy.

The deduction element in this game is pretty neat. There is a good bit of tension when playing either side.

One player is the killer, attempting to avoid detection while going on a murder spree.  The other player is the investigator, attempting to arrest the killer before becoming the next victim.  Both killer and investigator reside in a constantly-shifting grid of cards, only able to kill or investigate adjacent cards, and the killer can abandon his identity and disguise himself as someone new when the investigator is getting too close for comfort.

Good game, although I recommend you download the rulebook from the website, and not try and figure the game out from the rules-on-cards that come with the game (a horrible method of packaging rules, especially in this game, which bundles multiple games into one package!).  This is really a 2 player game with a couple of variations.  There is a 3-4 player game here, but it just doesn't look very good (I haven't played it).  This game plays fast, and is very portable.

If you know someone or have a group of people who enjoy deduction games, you will find MANY excuses to play this game due to how easy it is to field.  I suggest sleeves and a 100-count sleeved deck box.  The original box is WAY too damn small for transportation once you open.

I put off trying this for a very long time after getting the Minigame Library. When I did try it (online) my fears were... mostly confirmed? It seems rote and textureless, and trying to keep a list of eight suspects in my head at once is not particularly fun. But I didn't even [i]glimpse[/i] what fans of the game see in it, so I suspect there's something I'm still missing.

RATING: N/A
Not up for exploring it enough to know which ruleset is best or the most fun. I might try again once the Indines-themed copy arrives, since part of the problem is that just holding a list of possible suspects in my head is a large and unrewarded effort.

The retheme might actually fix my main objection to NOIR (which is that the cards are unmemorable and so tracking multiple suspects is a tiring memory game). Don't know how soon I'll try it.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (November 2015)

Noir is a very quick and light deduction game. I was hoping for a better game but I have only played the Killer Vs. Inspector variant. The rules are very easy, you can explain them under 2 minutes. The art of the cards is great and the gameplay is very fast.

Cool theme.

I feel the Killer has an advantage because he can “disguise” as another character, not sure how I feel about this, I need to play more times to see if this is an issue for me, after all I lost as the Killer. The game can end in turn two purely by luck, but as it is too short I’m not particularly bothered by this. The decisions aren’t that hard.

I just found out there are another version out for the game, the Black Box Edition. I dislike that this edition comes with more components for the game. I bought 2 Noir copies (with different art) but still I cannot play all the games that come in the Black Box. I feel like I shouldn’t buy any more games published by Level 99 Games because they do this sort of thing often. I bought the Noir games and now my copies of the game are outdated (after parsing the Black Box rules now there is a new rule for the game). The same thing happened with War of Indines, I bought the game and then they came up with changed/updates rules and different components in a better edition. Perhaps it is better to wait a couple of years to buy their games :/. 

Bottom line, I feel the game is unbalanced (but I will play more times to see if this is true). I plan to play the other available games in the series soon. Its best feature is its short playtime. In this category, Mr. Jack is a much better game for me.

This game is fun in a box and I love how many different games are in one box!!! After a few plays my wife and I found that moving in for the capture can be and little difficult especially if the villain has figured out who the detective is but we weren't put off by this, we started looking for alternative strategies and found them!! It's quick to set up and the games are not very long. In one game I hot lucky right away and captured my wife but that only happened once in all the games we have played so far.

RATING: 4
To fair, the full version of this game has six rule sets suitable for different numbers of players and I've only played one that works with a higher player count. In this version, there is a massive grid of identities laid on the table and each person secretly has one of the identities. You play in teams and you try to be the first team to eliminate x number of identities from other teams (x is dependent on the number of players). On your turn, you can try to kill an identity adjacent to your own, "canvass" an adjacent character which causes players to share if their identity is also adjacent to that character, or you can slide one row or column one card in either direction.

The game is spent taking pot shots and revealing your general location so people can take pot shots back at you or you move things around so nobody can really deduce much of anything. In fact, I think "Pot Shots" would an excellent, and more accurate, title for this one.

Online play at boardgamearena.com of Noir: Killer vs. Inspector. A decent two-player game of deduction and lucky shots. The killer has to take chances to win and aims to get into a good position to safely kill of his victims. The inspector has to deduct the killer's location. Lucky arrests can help. I wonder if the chances of winning are balanced but it's quick enough and fun enough to play online. Not sure if it is good enough to get for the collection.

Bought - NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game – Black Box Edition

Was part of Level 99 Games Minigame Library

May 20/15 - I was only interested in Pixil Tactics, and Noir - which I acquired separately, so I traded this away in Canadian Math Trade - Spring 2015 Edition.

RATING: N/A
NOIR: Killer vs. Inspector is a two-player game of hidden identities and deduction. Each player receives a secret identity from among 25 suspects and an open role that determines his available moves and victory conditions.

The Killer plays by eliminating players, focusing more on intuition and reading his opponent. The Inspector uses secret information and his ability to accuse suspects to create a play style more focused around logical elimination of possibilities.

There are a number of games in this game.  The main game is a killer versus inspector and the killer is located somewhere on the board and a player may shift cards, kill a card or shift identity.  The inspector can move around the board and tries to get next to the killer to capture him or her.  

It is an interesting game and a fun deduction game that plays in about 10 minutes.  There are a number of other games too that expand the number of players.  This is a good value for the money.

Initial thoughts: Feb 18th 2013
I really like the theme of this game.  I also like [thing=72287][/thing] and other deduction games.  So I was really excited to get this played.  We played a learning game of Killer vs. Inspector which is game 1, then we swapped roles, and played again, then swapped and played again, and again!! This was really fun.  It played quickly, and there were lots of different strategies to try out. 

I actually thought the game was only for 2 players, but this box comes with 4 games in 1!  Love it!  It's so nostalgic, and I really like games that are like this.  Definitely can't wait to try out the other games.  There's even a 3-4 player game in this box.  

March 26th 2013: This is one great portable game/set of games :) I've been playing the 2 player game & the 3-4 player game.  It's easy to teach, and who would have thought a $12 would be this much fun :)

Now that we are [i]always[/i] playing it online I should probably increase the rating to show how often I suggest it. It's a really fun, short filler. The game actually [i]is[/i] balanced. We have just neglected the other tricks available to the killer. Good game.

It's really just a sophisticated game of hide-n-seek, but what a game of hide-n-seek it is! For a game that is mostly an abstract game of shifting cards around and observation and gathering information, it really captures the feeling of spies, detectives, and deception. It scales well too.

Interesting and quick deduction game.  I have the version with the World of Indines characters instead of the original characters.  I think it came in one of their kickstarters for an Indines game.

I like it, but it's not necessarily great, as it diminishes in replays, since it's just more of the same experience every time.  Good enough for a quick game here and there.

After three plays it is still tough to rate this game as there are many variants within the box. The games we played were pure deduction and memory, not my strength but still fun as you move cards around and ask question to find your opponents (one was individual, another in teams). Looking forward to trying the other variants.

RATING: 5
Not expecting a whole lot from reading the rules and I was actually a bit worried that the Killer/Inspector could win on turn 2. After an initial play, I found the game interesting. It was tough to deduce where the investigator could be and trying to hide as the killer gets harder and harder. The artwork is great, the component quality is serviceable, although I worry about nicks on the cards after repeat usage.

I'd like to try this more and try a few different roles.

I love this game, but I have given it a lower score for two reasons. The first is that it relies on honesty - there is no way to prove your opponent I smacking legal moves. The second is due to teaching the game, it makes sense to me but a lot of people I have tried to teach get confused Witt the concepts.

If you have an established gaming group of experienced players then this is a fantastic buy.

 For the most part I tend to like deduction games, and I did like this one quite a bit. It is a fairly simple game, with a lot of depth. I feel like the killer side is a little harder to play, but both sides can present a challenge. Every move is full of strategic play, and there is a real element of trying to get into the head of the other player. The fact that there are four variations that offer their own unique spin on the base system shows that there is a lot of game in this little box.

Cool that there are four different games to play with this little deck.

I've tried 3 of the 4 modes now (all except Spy Tag) 

Killer VS Inspector is a nice quick 2 player filler; probably not too much depth, but good for what it aspires to be.

Hitman VS Sleuth has more depth and requires more of a gameplan. I think this is my favorite way to play so far!

Master Thief VS Chief of Police we did not like.

Abstract deduction game somewhere on the spectrum between boring and broken (see threads about the "disguise strategy"). Fábio Fontes artwork is that flavour of second-rate manga-style that I associate with bad fan-art. Supposedly these issues are alleviated in later editions, but there is no shortage of superior two player deduction games. Play Letters from Whitechapel instead.

Two years later, I was asked to review the updated Black Box Edition. When it comes to the basic Killer vs. Inspector mode, it's even better than the original — the added modes don't do much for me, but they're easy to ignore.

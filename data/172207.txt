I like word games so to craft words from the cards in your hand is fine until you roll 2 or less 3 times in a row... probably wouldn't play again unless others really were set on it.

This game is a really great word game. It's goofy, the theme is solid and doesn't get in the way. I really like it.

Fine word game and the Cthulhu theme actually applies a little bit.  Making crazy words and definitions when you're on the verge of insanity is cool.  I like the added randomness of the die roll even though I could see it annoying a lot of people, without it there's not much of a game here.  It's a little annoying you have to keep a word list and score on a piece of paper.  Maybe a little long for what it is.

I had the original version and I much prefer that artwork.  It's not that the new art is bad, I just thing that the original set the bar pretty high.

hated the new deluxe artwork. tossed the cards. Kept the colorful cathulhu figurines.

Kickstarted this game after seeing the episode of Wil Wheaton's Tabletop. As one friend put it, "it's like Scrabble meets Rummy." It is a lot of fun. Everyone had a good first game, even those who normally dislike word games. I might prefer the art style of the original/non-Deluxe Edition a little, personally, but the Cthulhu pawns are awesome.

A simple press-your-luck game that is good for a filler or for playing with non-gamers. It's far more fun when you can be insane and make up your own words but you generally get knocked out of the game before you can have too much fun with it. It feels like the insanity aspect could have been worked in to be a meatier feature of the game somehow.

I was sold on this by the Tabletop episode it starred in, but after getting a copy, I have my doubts about long-term playability. We'll see what the future holds.

Fun word game with the Cthulu sanity mechanic that mitigates having bad letters. Seems like a blast (as far as word games go). Kickstarted this one back in June. Won't ship until February :/

This is such a great idea for a simple word game, the risk/reward mechanic fits perfectly and the longest words don't necessarily win the game.

I enjoy this game a lot, it is simple and the going crazy aspect is lots of fun.  Always make people define their words!

Simple game to explain and get playing.  Has some fun elements (especially the house rule to require a definition of the gibberish word you create when going insane).  However, I hate the dice rolling because dice hate me.  I know it needs some randomness, but it sucks when you fail almost all of your sanity checks.

Grail game!  Was out of print, then finally had a Kickstarter to fund a new version.  Missed out on the campaign, and have been following the "Release date TBA" notices all over the place for a couple of years.  Gave up for a while, then finally tracked it down, but only through an online retailer.  Arrived yesterday and...woo hoo!  Can't wait to play it with my family.

Quick game. I love word games, I love Cthulhu, I certainly don't mind being a bit insane or making up random non-existing words as I go, and so I am bound to love this game.

PLAYED! FINALLY! Took like 1.5 years post-Kickstarter to arrive. Played at a party w/ decidedly non-gamers (and a couple not-native English speakers) who seemed to enjoy it, but even they also thought it was weirdly simple and not very challenging, for all the hype.

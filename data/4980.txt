RATING: 5
We were confused by the dice and goals and scoring system at first, which is never a good sign, especially for a relatively simple game.  A good game should make some kind of sense right from the start.  Then when playing, there's no real way to deduce what your opponents are trying to do, so it's mostly down to just chance who wins.  I spent a couple of hours trying to think of house or alternate rules that would make this game worth keeping, then gave up and decided to re-purpose the bits for something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The components are very nice and solid, and the game is easy to learn and play. However, the last couple of players seem to have a lot more influence over the outcome than they should. This probably sounds over-critical, but the game was enjoyable. I may be willing to trade for a copy.

This has hit the table a few times because it is so quick to set up.  I really looks good on the table and as an abstract, it's not so bad.

Makes a great piece for the coffee table.

RATING: 6
The high-quality pieces for this game are worth the price alone.  The gameplay is all right; the rounds are short, and it seems as though a lot of the strategy involves what the other player has predicted--if the two of you have predicted complementary cityscapes, a lot less back-and-forth conflict will occur.

Competition with other good games has pushed this rating down a little, but I still find it an excellent game. It is quick to play, looks spectacular and has the sensual charm of solid wood. It takes no more than 5-10 minutes to play but involves a lot of subtle strategy and deception. I find it plays better with 2 than with 4.

RATING: 9
This game causes me to swear at my opponents more than any other.  But, for some reason, even with this HUGE frustration factor, I enjoy it immensely.  The psycho-strategy of trying to fulfill your mission without making it too obvious is awesome.  You can sometimes trick your opponents into thinking you're building a style which you are NOT.  The wooden bits and HEAVY gameboard are tremendously satisying, giving this an extra rating point over just the gameplay alone.

I like it more every time I play.  It goes quick, which adds to the "one more time!" factor of the game.

This is a nice quick tactile game.  You get something interesting to look at once all the blocks have been placed and I like that.  Might not be too deep, but it's a nice one.  Playing 1v1 on corners is a nice strategic change.  you have to manage two different skylines and that add just a bit of depth.

Also, I like the idea of rolling the planning dice instead of just picking what you'd like to attempt to score.

RATING: 7
Pretty solid gameplay, with plenty of opportunities to screw opponents.  The two-player variant works quite well.  A game doesn't take more than about 20 minutes.  The solid wood components are nice.

On the downside, I've played a number of games of Cityscape where I felt rather helpless.  It's not difficult to find yourself in a situation where all the other players on the board are working against your goals, whether consciously or not.  Those games aren't so much fun, so it's good that they end quickly.

Also, the use of dice to mark a player's goals is completely asinine.

Each player looks at a different edge, and trying to get the cityscape to look a particular way from their perspective.  It's kind of interesting, but there are cases where your opponent plays more or less randomly from your perspective in a way that can make or break your game.

Not bad for an abstract, and the pieces are very nice. It ends up being pretty chaotic, especially as the last pieces are placed. But still, it's very quick and easy to explain. This seems like one of the best choices for a quick abstract, except that you need to have exactly 4 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good fun quick game with just enough thought to make it worth while.  I want to play it more, but it just never makes it off the shelf, which hurts it's rating.  I think it may suffer from needing exactly four people to play it properly.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Like all of the Out of the Box MasterPiece games, the components are highly crafted stained wood. The game is very easy to learn and only takes about 10 minutes to play. It's a good game to play while you're waiting for the rest of your gaming group to arrive. 
 
You can play with up to 4 players, but I don't think this game works that well with more than 2. With 4 players, it just becomes a game of luck where you have very little control over what happens. You pretty much just hope that people don't screw up your plans too much. With 3 players, the player with no one across from them has a distinct advantage. The 2 player game works exactly the same as the 4 player game, but each player plays 2 sides. The reason I like this better is because it gives you a little more to think about. You have to play your piece so that it works for both of your sides. If you're not careful, you could do a move that helps one of the sides you are playing, but accidently screws up the other side you are playing. The two player game seems more mentally challenging and less chaotic. 
 
Although it's not a bad game, it's not one I see myself playing more than a few times a year.

Original idea and nice use of the "line of sight" mechanics. Also "bluffing" and last minute "screwing" of the opponent. However in more than two player it feels a little "random". The reason for winning often becomes that one of the opponents unknowingly helped you instead of a clever plan.

This is an attractive, quick, simple, fun game. My one complaint (if this kind of thing bothers you) is that it's not as good with less than four players. It's not unplayably bad or anything, but you can just tell when you're playing that it would be *really* fun with four. Fun Suggestion: roll your dice to determine your building goals.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick game of city-building, with lots of player interaction.  Each player comes up with his or her own "plan" for the view of the city from their vantage point, and plays one piece on a 4-by-4 grid; play continues clockwise until all 25 pieces have been placed.  Observant players will learn to read other players' intentions and plan accordingly.  The challenge of meeting your own building goals while disrupting those of others requires both planning and flexibility.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very light but clever and always rewarding game, where the pinches of strategy (choosing aims), tactics and bluff (filling the board) are well balanced. 

The game obviously works best with four players or with two facing each other (more cutthroat than playing on different directions), whereas the play with three might be unbalanced. Otherwise, Cityscape should be played several times in a row (an hour?) for maximum impact (knowing the players better the air gets thicker!).

Last but not least, the material is usual Pintoy quality -it can't be more inviting.

I love these new games by Pin...they are beautifully constructed in real wood, and they play very well.  This one is definitely best with 4.  Games go pretty quick, and takes a few games to understand the bidding element and how best to use it.

RATING: 7
Another game to love for the looks, but play is solid also.  2 player is very aggressive, and pretty easy to determine (and do your best to control/screw) the other player's bid.  At it's chaotic strongest at 4, when you must make serious decisions about which blocks to pursue and which to give up on.

RATING: 7
A good abstract with heavy weight wooden components. Player set secret goals (how the end board will look like) and then place a wooden block each turn. Once all blocks (of different heights) are placed, the game ends and scores are calculated.

It's a light placement filler and games go for 10 minutes tops. There's more control with 2 and 3 players than with 4 but it's so short I usually play one round for each player with the highest total score winning.

RATING: 6.5
Quick abstract with enough "theme" to make it engrossing.  The big clunky wooden blocks make this a joy to play.  I like the diminishing sizes so there is some great planning that you can do based on what pieces are left.  I've only played this two player and I find that there is sufficient control, as this forces a triage on your goals. I'm not sure that the "6" option works in a two player game.  Perhaps it should not be included or only rewarding 10 points.

I think it's pretty fun over all. My concern is the luck factor is quite high. This isn't bad per se, but if it means the game doesn't offer alot of variety, then that's rather poor. I like the spacial aspect of building and trying to find a shape that is most likely to pay off. So it's not bad and I'll likely play it a few more times.

Enjoyable little game when I'm in the mood for a bit more of a luck-fest.  An interesting dice (as cube-y as [I]Cubism[/I] gets) game, but it seems like more could have been done to incorporate more art into the game.

This game came out of nowhere for me, had never heard of it and a buddy's dad brought it to a gaming afternoon. What a great game. Streamlined, little downtime, nice mechanics, and most of the time you are doing the fun 'core' hook of the game, which in this case is rolling dice and using them as building blocks to make different 3D shapes. Some of the non-core aspects of the game (in particular the optional artist cards) could have been improved, but this is a minor detraction from a fantastic game which to me, at least, has flown criminally under the radar.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fairly light game. You can get a lovely cascade of effects manipulating the dice from the artist cards. I definitely prefer this to Blueprints, which admittedly I have only played 2p.

RATING: 7
Based on 1 play with 2 players:

Surprised by how much "take that!" there is in this game - something I usually really dislike but I think works very well here. It never feels unfair (or worse, random.) It really makes this puzzley game feel very interactive & competitive.

This isn't much of a brain burner, but there's a satisfying decision space for its length/dicey nature. It goes by quick with two - in a way that suggests to me that 2 is actually the ideal player count. I also appreciate the care that was given to the luck factor - there's ways to influence chance, but a good roll is still a good roll.

I really like Cubist! The mechanics and theme meld together very well--I really did feel like I was creating sculptures in a museum and then creating the museum itself, too. Loved the use of the dice and how the Artist cards help mitigate the luck factor of rolling the dice and waiting for specific combinations. I played this game numerous times at Origins and everyone I played it with liked it very much and, like me, said they'd be buying it when it is published. It's a great game to go along with the others in Gryphon's art-game line. I highly recommend it and hope that everyone will have as much fun playing it as I did. Kudos to Steve Poelzing and Alf Seegert--you guys have created a winner!!! :-)

[thing=147431][/thing] is about rolling dice and building 3D shapes with the dice.  The roll determines where in your construction you can place the dice.  It is a neat game involving building stuff (always a pleasure) and managing your dice rolls and dice placement in the race to build specific structures.  

It is light enough to work as a non-gamers game, even a family game.  A good filler too.

RATING: 6
Pretty fun if you like chucking dice around.  If luck is a dealbreaker for you, then you should stay away.  For me, I like the idea of interpreting the 2D into 3D and simply working on a project.  While strategy is minimal, there is some to be found in manipulating your dice and long(er)-term planning with your storeroom and combining these things to complete your projects faster than the next person.

It's a decent way to kill some time so long as you know what to expect out of it.

Puzzle-like game which comes with 81 dice, and you're using dice to physically build 3D structures for a museum.  Light, quick, yet very creative and unique.  There's some luck, but the game offers a lot of flexibility and ways to mitigate this (e.g. artist cards, two workrooms, plus storage area).  Even better than I was expecting!

See my pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/1221081

Plus 18 card expansion which contains:
[gameid=163425] (is a +1VP bonus needed?)
[gameid=163426] (nice to have some more variety)
[gameid=163427] (always play with these, except remove 4-5 point cards for first time players)

Very abstract, which is I guess thematic in a meta way.  The game was simple yet provided interesting decision points.  I don't understand why the art cards are reminiscent of Pastiche as they don't function anywhere near the same way.  Too bad Gryphon doesn't have distribution in Europe because I think this could be a sleeper SdJ nominee.  It's not a great game but definitely fits into that narrow category.

I thought i would like this game.. Pity i didn't.
Why..? Because there is not much strategy going on. Your best available option is often pretty obvious & the rest is just luck.
I would recommend Blueprints for a similar but more strategic game. (also more exciting because of hidden information)

First played July 5th, 2015. Good game with good mix of luck and strategy. You roll 2 dice each round and build structures with the dice to match a building in the group area. Once you match you get the card which allows you to get a dice the can play in the group play area. You get points for each dice in the group play area that you placed and the cards you claimed from the shared area. Give this a try as it doesn't take long and has a good fun factor.

* Kickstarted! *

Roll dice and build "artworks" or get help from artists depending on what you roll. If you finish an artwork first, you get to use one die towards building the museum wing, who's completion is one of the two ways to trigger the end game. Medium challenge all based on dice rolls.

PLUS: shapes are challenging, you may have to take apart what you built because you're trapped
SEMI-PLUS: artist cards are named after Cubist painters (not Picasso and Braque) with bios in the manual
MINUS: manual isn't perfect

First game impressions have been very positive. A touch of dice-placement, a bit of combo working and a fair bit of competitiveness and double-guessing. On the basis of it, there's nothing terribly striking about Cubist, but it seems that all the ingredients slot together well and don't outstay their welcome.

I had a marbling smear on one die, which was a bit of a shame, but otherwise the component quality is as outstanding as ever from Gryphon.

[b]Cubist[/b] was received in a math trade. (9/14/14)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]Cubist is by far my favorite meaty dice game (Qwixx when looking for a filler). This game has held up extremely well to repeated play, there are plenty of museum and installation cards to keep things fresh especially when you add in these two expansions: Cubist: Museum Expansion Pack and Cubist: Additional Installation Cards.

This game plays excellent across all player counts (2 - 4) with very little down time, games wrap up in 30 - 45 minutes. It has also gone over equally well with my family and other gamers in my group. Being an artist and art teacher I am always excited to see designers using art as a theme for their games (check out another of Alf's games: Musée) especially Cubism in this case (definitely not a really well known art movement among most people).

Cubism is a masterpiece design that manages to weave in the theme with the game play mechanisms to create a rich play experience. Check this game out if you enjoy dice games that don't rely heavily on luck, but instead offer a variety of strategies to achieve your goals.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (9):[/COLOR]

[i]- I absolutely love the theme, this is what sold me on the game (that and the beautiful dice).
- Quick playtime, even with 4 players (30 - 45 minutes).
- Plays great at all player counts (2,3 and 4 players).
- It would be a bit tight, but I think this can be brought out at a cafe.
- Easy to teach/learn. You can really just start playing and teach as you go.
- Artist cards are quite valuable and I am surprised at how much they can be fought over.
- Love the idea of not only building your own installation but also being able to share in the building of the museum.
- A surprising amount of tension in the game, especially since any of the 3 installations can be built by anyone (once built a new one comes out).

I have been looking for some fun dice games to add to our collection, one light and quick and one with some depth.
I was able to score a copy of this in a recent math trade, in fact I traded Ra the Dice Game since I was underwhelmed by the 2p experience.[/i]

基本上每回合擲的兩顆骰就決定會不會贏
如果使用骰子去驅動藝術家卡
基本上就會慢了一拍
多送骰到中央美術館應該是勝利的不二法門
規則:
*放置美術館圖板，照玩家人數挑出美術館卡，隨機抽1放在圖板上，擲紅色美術館基石骰，放到圖板指定的區域，洗混所有的裝置卡，蓋著放到圖板的右下方，開三張，洗混畫家卡，蓋著放到圖板的左上方，開四張
*每個玩家選擇一種顏色，拿取所有骰子，工作室圖板直接正面朝上放到面前，圖版右上可以存放兩個骰子，隨機起始
*遊戲輪流進行直到結束條件觸發，每次有四個階段
1.從你的個人供應區拿取兩顆骰並投擲，放到圖板右下儲藏間
*如果不夠2顆骰擲，先執行步驟3在擲骰
2.從儲藏間(右上保管室也可使用)把骰子分配到一個或多個地方 
>工作室 還沒有時任意放，有的時候數字一樣才能疊，差一才能相鄰放置，一定要放相鄰
>畫家卡 放置一樣數值的多顆骰字到對應畫家卡上，如果有其他人的你放置骰點要比他大或等於，該行動要下回合才能用，如果四張都有骰子則卡片移除骰子回手
>保管室 右上儲存最多兩顆
3.行動階段可執行
>執行畫家卡行動 移除上面你的骰子執行行動，畫家卡正面移到牌庫底部，開新的補
>完成裝置 完成裝置卡上擺設後，所有骰子回手，拿走該卡開新的補，在該卡上下放空格擺骰子，數字等同該卡左下數字(多個數字則可在之後轉換)，卡上的骰可移動到美術館
>放棄裝置 移除多個區域所有骰子，只能改放到畫家卡或移除
>從裝置卡移動骰子 從裝置卡照放置規則放到美術館(只有這邊的可移動到美術館)，也可放到自己工作間或放畫家卡，放完後裝置卡翻面
4.從儲藏間移除多餘的骰子
*如果完成五個或以上的裝置，或者美術館完成遊戲結束，加總裝置卡所有分數，美術館裡的骰子一顆兩分，平手比美術館裡骰子數目

A longer, more random, yet advanced version of Blueprints. I like being able to work on multiple projects and employ the help of the artist cards. There is almost always something to do with your dice, and "cooperatively" building the museum is a nice timer/end-game trigger. There are a few confrontational cards that feel a bit out of place in the game and it occasionally gets frustrating when bad luck visits many turns in a row, but I can't complain too much. There's always the option to abandon a project that isn't paying off and change course.

Roll dice, build structures with the dice.  Similar game is Blueprints.

Some differences between Cubist and Blueprints:
1) Cubist - racing to build the same structure.
2) Blueprints - you build in secret.  Cubist you build openly.
3) Cubist - Colors indicate the players.  In Blueprints, color indicates the type of materials you are using (each of the materials score differently)
4) In Blueprints, you can ignore the blueprint and just go for points.  In cubist, no points if you don't follow the plan.
5) In cubist it must be exact number in order to stack one die on top of another.  In Blueprints, it needs to be the same or a higher number.
6) In Cubist you can modify your rolls (via artist cards)

the game works but I find nothing interesting.  I wanted to like building stuff out of dice, but I found it to be mostly mechanical and low on real choice.  For an artistic game, it's a tad complex.  For a strategy game, it lacks depth.

RATING: 5
There are a lot of strong similarities to Blueprint here.  In this game players roll two dice a turn.  They can start building a structure or store up to two of these dice.  The structures are represented by cards in the center any player can claim when they've matched the layout in one of their structures.  There are also art cards you can buy with pairs or triples of dice and when you claim a structure card you also get a die you can contribute to the main structure that everyone is contributing to.

The building rules here are much more stringent than in Blueprint.  A die can only be stacked on top of another die if it matches the number and adjacent dice need to be adjacent on the number line and you cannot go around-the-world (attach a 1 to a 6).

Honestly this felt a lot clunkier than Blueprint.  Blueprint was so simple and smooth and played quickly and left me with a good feeling.  This feels like the building rules are just a little too oppressive with so few options on each turn.  Luck can certainly rear its head here and you have so few ways to alter or control your dice that it just got frustrating.

I never see a reason to spend more time to have less fun playing this than Blueprint, a definite pass for me.

Easy to setup, learn and play. Can play with light gamers and crazy plotting gamers.

RATING: 6.3
tl;dr: fine

Dice games are a dime a dozen these days. I generally enjoy them. Most of them simply combine a number of familiar elements to make a new game. This is one of those games. You have the building aspect like in [thing=140933][/thing] but everyone is competing to complete the same structure before someone else does. There are some other cards to spice things up and there are - for the most part - no rerolls. It all works fine, but it doesn't do anything new so if you already have a similar game in your collection, there's no real reason to own this one as well.
And the artwork is ugly, ugly, ugly. I guess, I don't like cubism.

Pretty enjoyable.  The artist cards mitigate the dice randomness.  We play to equal number of turns.

Very good family game - kids can give adults a run for their money. Adults have the advantage of being able to plan ahead for more involved dice/artist-card combos.

Luck mitigation is not sufficient.  Boring downtime when other player is taking their turn.

Cubist blends dice rolling with spatial goals in an arthouse theme.  It can be easy to play, but it is unnecessarily difficult to teach.  The bland player mat is a wasted opportunity to simplify the rule book and illustrate the flow of materials through one's studio. Other design misses include the card iconography and the goofball nomenclature (Storeroom vs. adjacent Storage Room?)  Cubist is a great 45-minute dice game rendered just middling by inadequate development.    It deserves a reprint from a committed publisher.

A combination of completing installations to grab bonus dice which you can use to score points in building the museum. Reminiscent of Blueprints with another level of game built on, but lacking the drafting to dampen down the dice luck.

Nice, mostly short turns, building towards the various installations is cute, but can kill you if you spend a lot of effort, but get beaten to one of the big ones. A little swingy in dice, but generally appealing. Docked a fraction of a point for saminess through the play.

A simple, fun little game. Nice aesthetics with some pretty cool dice. :)

Cubist is a fairly straightforward simple quick game.

Roll dice. Try to build structures matching the scoring cards.  Dice can be placed next to other dice which are one higher or lower.  Or stacked on top of the same number. You can keep two dice in storage for the next turn.

If you build a structure you can claim the matching scoring cars. Scoring cards also give you extra dice which can be used to build a communal scoring structure or your own structures.  And lastly there are cards where you can place matching dice to get special abilities.

This was interesting and enjoyable. My rating could go up after further play; I want to see how it works when everyone at the table knows what they're doing.

Fun light filler with a nice spatial element. Plays in 20-30 minutes. The building aspect is the draw, both with each player's own installations and the communal museum.

When I first commented on this game I said it was better than Blueprints.  Now I'm not so sure.  The problem comes down to playing dice to create the museum.  What I've seen in multiple games is that you end up with dice you acquired from completing installations that don't fit in the museum because they're the wrong number combined with cards that don't help you manipulate those dice to get you the correct numbers.  So you're stuck with worthless dice.  The only way to mitigate this is to go for installations you know will be easy to fit in the museum.  This is easier said than done, however.  

Meanwhile, repeat plays of Blueprints has made me realize its hidden depth for such a small filler.  

I'll give Cubist a few more plays and we'll see.  It might go on the trading block.

(Aug 2014) - Thought it would have more or an "art" theme and ended up being a bit abstract die building placement game.

Had a few questions on our first play which the rulebook did not cover - will seek out answers here.

Lots of dice, plays pretty quick.

This game is very fun. It's like Blueprints but better. I am not a fan of Cubist art work but the game is a lot of fun. The dice are a luck factor but you can modify the dice to help you. The dice are beautiful. Our first game play was trying to help each other with assigning dice so we understand the game better. I really like this game. It also helped that I won. :)

Feels like a more relaxed version of Blueprints, but has also more options of where to put your dice.

A variant of Blueprints. This is a race to build modern cube art with dice matching pattern cards representing commissioned sculptures. Obviously, luck plays a big role. Of-a-kind numbers stack vertically, ascending and descending numbers are placed horizontal and adjacent. Doubles allow you to get help from the Modern Art masters allowing you to break the rules.

[i]Warning[/i]: Cubist may or may not be a cheap rip-off of Blueprint, which I haven't played.  I should really give Blueprint a go, given how every other comment for Cubist mentions it prominently.

Despite its semi-derivative (?) origins, Cubist kept me awake when I should have been sleepy.  I ended up winning, and certainly had fun, but other players were frustrated because being lucky makes you good, and I was luckier than others - both in terms of rolling dice (generally) and having certain sculptures become available that were exactly what I needed.

Having hot dice is particularly important, since it can make all the difference for players racing to complete the same sculpture.  Beating out your competitors is critical, since the penalty for losing is that the winner gets the points and bonus die (or dice) and the loser gets nothing, zip, zero - other than fond memories of previously wasted turns.

The closest analogy to having a sculpture snatched from your grasp is being stabbed in the heart by a rabid monkey, which I understand also isn't easy to recover from.  Though if you've been stabbed, and your assailant runs away empty-handed, you get a free knife! How cool is that.

FR - Essayé et acheté à Essen Spiel 2014. Beaucoup de dés (20 par personne) et une mécanique moins évidente qu'il n'y paraît, avec des cartes spéciales pour transformer les dés qui serviront à construire le musée central/commun. La concurrence d'un plus grand nombre de joueurs semble enrichir le jeu.

OK dice game with some twists.  However, becomes less satisfying with more players as others repeatedly snag an installation you had spent several turns working on.  Ultimately too random and chaotic for my tastes.

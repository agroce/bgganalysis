RATING: 6
Very nice card driven game! Ancient war when Gothics fight against Roman empire around 377-382 AD.
I have played the game with one more player. One takes the control of two romans armies and the another played with gothic three armies. Gothic armies try to plunder the empire cities (9) and romans they try to prevent them.

Provisional rating - only played once.

Overall like it - map takes a bit of getting used to, as cities are marked with their name rather than an icon, so it's a bit difficult working out which roads connect where.

Spelling errors on cards etc, but nothing that totally confuses.

Can't see why you'd ever play this with more than 2, it isn't a multiplayer game.

Overall, fun asymmetric card driven game, where you feel your opponent has more options (and they feel the same!)

Played it several times on 2-player mode. It is really fast paced and personally I love it. But my GF is struggling with it: Playing goths and realizing that you wonÂ´t make it for winning after ~60% of playtime is not fun...

2 to 5 players crawl into the skin of Goth leaders who try to pillage 9 cities in the East-Roman empire, more specifically the Balkans, or of Roman defenders who try to prevent this. The battle takes 6 years, with each year divided into 4 seasons. During these seasons each of the Goths and the Romans receives a certain amount of cards. Each card can be used in different ways, so one has to choose how to use each card. Will you use it to move your army, or do you want to use the battle action on the card, or will you spend it in order to help out one of your fellow leaders who is under attack ?

A light war game with promise, but plagued with issues, not a multiplayer by any stretch of the imagination.

The action cards are multi-use but very generic, unlike say a more historic CDG by GMT.

I question the viability of the gothic invader goal cards. All in all it's too simple to be worth playing.

Very enjoyable light and fast wargame. Would recomending playing up to 4 players. Because if anybody gets eliminated he is not really out but can take over another leader.

the object of the game if you are a goth is to plunder.
If you are romans it is to prevent the goths from plundering their objectives (6 or 9 cities)

The game moves very slow as there is only so much you can do with the cards and you have to have the right cards on your hand.


I rate this a six because I own invasion of canada and that scratches the same itch and moves at a better pace with exciting fights.
The fights in this game feel like math professors fight. 

If you can't fit 1812 or 1775 on your table well I would play this alternative.

A light-wargame, easy to learn and play, but tense, thematic, immersive and strategic. I love the story behind the game. I love the "ancient" style and art of the board.

If you are looking for a gateway card driven wargame, there is no need to look further. Simple and deep.

RATING: 8
Excellent gateway card-driven wargame. The theme is implemented very well. The two warring parties are fairly balanced, but at the same time the designers managed to stay true at the historic events and the characteristics of each side (of course, within the boundaries and limitations of a boardgame). The gameplay offers the opportunities to your strategic and tactical virtues to shine.

I have played the game with my son about a dozen times by now and my only concern is its replayability. In other words I would love some scenario-based battles.

In conclusion, a great game to introduce your kids to the card-driven mechanism.

Game came down to the very last roll.  It had looked like my Goths had no chance, barely penetrated the interior after three years, but made a game of it as the Romans were beaten down.  Lots of take that by the Romans can relly slow the Goths.  I had terrible rolls at plundering when I needed them.  Plays quite quickly and the cards are straightforward.  Not the greatest game ever, but a kind of CDG light.

In many respects, not really my thing, but I quite enjoyed this. Goths versus Romans, team card play to move, plunder, do battle, etc. Shame I misread the short game setup rules, resulting in 3 Romans versus us Goths.

Good production / artwork.

RATING: 8
A very good light card driven wargame. It plays fast, the rulebook is well written and the components are excellent. The only "problem" with the game is the necessity to operate several hands of cards simultaneously if played by two. That can lead to difficulty for the opponent to follow who of your generals exchange cards between each other. Very historical feeling.

Comparatively fast-playing card-driven wargame, with asymmetric player powers representing the Goths invading and Eastern Romans defending. Very nice indeed!

RATING: 7
Have only played a partial 2-player game on VASSAL, but LOVE it!  Lots of cool interactions and abilities and the theme is one of my favorites!  Will hopefully get to sit down to a real game sometime in the future.  [update] Just read some more reviews on it, and raised it to a 1 on my wishlist!  Very much looking forward to acquiring this game!

RATING: 3
This was an odd experience. I had a fantastic time playing this with Stephen Avery and someone else who looks like Tom Hanks at the Oasis of Fun, but it was all due to the company, not because of the game. The prophecy was deduced almost instantly, and the game became a race to see who could defeat the bad guy first. Except, because of our powers we all could mess with each other pretty easily, which made the game drag far longer than it should have... we called it once margaritas were being served! I'm glad I tried this, but I am pretty sure I will never play again.

This game is a cross between [i]Clue[/i] and a dungeon crawl. It is essentially a deduction game with a bidding mechanism and the potential for some "take that!" action.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed the first part of the game very much: Deducting the proper prophecy. I did not have as much fun trying to assemble the proper hunting party to take down the Shadow. I'd rate the first part a 7 or 7.5, and the end game a 5. The shares mechanic works very well. I didn't mind the components, but there was an awful lot of card warping.

Really good game. Dragged a bit the first time through because no one was familiar with the cards, we clocked it at 2.5 hours. Definitely have to pay attention in this game to get clues about which skills aren't needed to kill the shadow. A long time was spent party building with very few exploratory hunts.

RATING: 3
This game is rather broken.  The components and theme seem like the game would have a lot more going for it, but it boils down to a very simple Clue variant.  It's possible to fluke a victory very early in the game.

RATING: 9
A really great game that has a strong theme intertwined with deep strategy.  I have played this game about 10 times and no two games have been the same and have always been interesting.  I noticed that one reviewer mentioned that the game was unbalanced and random.  I think that's completely false.  This is one of the more balanced and non random games that I have played in a while.  Munchkin and Killer Bunnies are random, in this game you can actually use strategy and skill to come out on top.  All of the characters seem pretty well balanced to me.  You just have to know how to play to their abilities.  If you have played this game more than one or two times you will notice that it takes skill and not luck to win.  This is definitely one of my favorite games right now.  In addition, the artwork is really phenomenal, I have spent a lot of time just looking at all the art of the characters.

RATING: 5
I find the game pretty fun.  This is essentially special-powers Clue, and the twists are quite nice.  there are only four of each card, so the deduction aspect does not take that long.  But amassing the correct party in order to go on these hunts, while not giving away your hand, is a tricky thing.  The bidding is certainly competitive and a blast.  Taking your party on missions to build up loot, also fun.  HP has a lot of creative and fun ideas.

Alas, it is not without its flaws either.  There are just some stupidly unbalanced heroes.  "Look at your opponents cards"?  Come on.  Seriously.  Also, there needs to be more heroes per pile with the required combat trait.  I won one game by "Paladin-locking" my opponent, which is fun but hardly satisfying.

So, great ideas but a few too many broken cards.  I can't even justify taking the broken ones out because there aren't enough characters.  Fun but flawed.

Played about four times before finally purchasing from the publishers at BGG.con. I've played Clue and own Mystery of the Abbey and I warmed to this one very quickly. The components are well done and sturdy and the interaction between the various characters and items in your party; the incorporation of "shares" into a profit-driven enterprise; and the introduction of some negotiation into the bargain is adroitly handled and surprisingly quick and light. A fine cross-roads title for casual gamers, and those that enjoy deduction, resource management, and some negotiation  that delivers in both theme and mechanics.

RATING: 4
Wanted to like this one - but didn't :(

The deduction mechanic seemed like a good idea, but didn't really work in practice (and I can't see it being very satisfactory with more than 3 players anyway). Characters didn't seem particularly balanced, and combinations of characters makes a big difference - some are powerful, some are weak. Didn't like the art (which doesn't help with the fantasy theme for me). In the end I just felt frustrated - couldn't get the combinations of characters I needed, and getting them is luck of the draw, same for combat.

Overall good collection of ideas, just doesn't quite work for me.

My rating will go up or down depending on my next play. The first play was with 5 and we were all learning, it took too long and we couldnt finish. 5 is way too fiddly it seems. I love the concept, mechanics and quality and I am waiting on pins to play it again (with 3). Plus, I got to be a *princess* who says, "Daddy I need more money!"

I've played it a few more times and while its fun and has replay value, I bumped it down to a 7.5 because it does have a tendency to feel the same.

RATING: 5
Unique little game. Despite what it says on the box, this is DEFINITELY made for three players... playing with two just makes it go by far too quick. The deduction element is really, really light (we're talking lighter than Clue here, and in fact, it uses almost the exact same questioning mechanic as Clue.) The theme is actually quite effective despite the fact that the art is simply atrocious. The rulebook, however, is excellent. Spiral bound with little tabs for each section? Why aren't more rulebooks this well organized? The game is fun enough (all the little choices you have and various mechanics are enjoyable, if simple) but the biggest problem is the endgame can be pretty anticlimactic. Especially if someone says the correct prophecy and loses to the Shadow. Then everyone knows the prophecy and it's just a race to the finish. For that matter, the combat itself is sort of lame, but it's a light enough game that that doesn't really matter too much, especially since forming a good party can help with the randomness.

Munchkin vs. Cluedo was my first thought, along with these impressions: Good storage, large sturdy cards, fantastic rulebook with some VERY interesting game mechanics! And the worst boxart ever ^^ Gameplay wise this game has its ups and downs, though I'm glad its positive characteristics surpasses its negative. It's hard for me to describe just how amazing this game really is - quite a unique gaming experience I must say. The game's depth COULD give you a headache though, this is NOT something for the "weak minded" like those of you who have a hard time thinking logical and ahead. Too bad it doesn't play all that well with four players (nor five, I imagine)... Still, I must admit that Hunting Party is one of my favorite games. It's a pretty odd game with some astonishing game mechanics and a well written rulebooks which makes it easy to learn, but hard to master.

RATING: 2
Essentially take the idea behind Clue and then add a whole bunch of fantasy gloss and you have Hunting Party. There are, like Clue, 3 categories...in this case, location of the dark lord, the weapon necessary to kill him, and the skill necessary to track them. The main meat of the game is buying characters in an auction that have abilities that allow you to see what cards the other players have in hand to pinpoint the 3 cards the dark lord is sitting on, and then to go finish him off.

Why does this game not work, at all?

#1: It's got too many randomizing factors. My character's special ability, for instance, let me switch out one of my cards with one of the secret cards at random. This makes things easier for me, but makes the note taking laborious for everyone else.

#2: Unbalanced special powers. My ability was not balanced, and another player also seemed to have one that was much too good, the ability to directly look at other player's cards without actually having to risk people on the quest.

#3: Adds nothing of substance to the Clue engine and does add significant length. The game dragged on...and on...and on. I was reluctant to use my ability to switch the dark lord's cards because I was hoping someone would catch him to end the game. I've said it before and I'll say it again: if you want a solid, fast-playing deduction game with a minimal luck element, pull out Sackson's Case of the Elusive Assassin, it has all of the good stuff of this genre with none of the overhead and a fraction of the length.

There are few games that I have played that are a slog like this one was...and it must receive a 2 for it.

RATING: 5.5
This is a fun game. Good theme and a decent amount of strategy mixed with luck that isn't overpowering. As many others have said, there is a strong "Clue" element to this game, but there is still quite a bit more to it. The game plays fast in terms of each players turn. The most interesting part about the game is really resource management. You only have 8 shares to split among the people you want in your party and you have to bid shares against the other players to get the Hunters you want. The downsides to this game are that it really does only play optimally with 3 players. Still a decent game and not a bad start for a new gaming company.  The theme worked well enough and we had fun. The company was also very good to me. I had a problem with the card stock and they contacted ME to replace it. That will keep customers.

Interesting clue variant, but I don't like it as much as Mystery of the Abbey.  It definitely is more structured in the deduction phase than the questions in MoA, but on the other hand it is even more chaotic (than Bruno?!?)

Clue: The Gathering!  A bit too random, but it seems to go pretty quickly so it's not too annoying.  I wish the deduction aspect were a little more sophisticated, more on the level of Black Vienna or Sleuth, but maybe that would just make it too long.  Sadly the artwork doesn't do much for me.

Rating after 3 plays.  Great strategy game.  It is never the same twice, as you have to alter what you do based on who you are able to recruit and what the prophesy is.  Theoretically, if you like the system it is infinitely replayable.  And lets not forget that the production quality of the components is several steps *above* top notch.  Great game!

RATING: 7
UPDATE: Bumping down to a 7. While I still enjoy the game, it just doesn't seem to work that well. I've had two games now that have dragged on forever as we sort of get into a stalemate position. One person keeps fighting and gaining money, while the others are able to defeat the shadow but choose not to because they won't get enough money to win. 

Have played with 2 and 3 players now. The game does seem a little unbalanced and requires thorough knowledge of the different cards and powers. But the theme is encapsulating, the gameplay is unique, the components are gorgeous, and the fun-factor is way high.

I had some fun with this Clue variation but eventually moved it on due to how long it could drag and the clunkiness of the powers sometimes resulting in gross imbalances. First off, you need to play with 3 people only; any more and the game will feel interminable. The rules are a bit clunky so be prepared to work through them.

All in all, it's a flawed design that has some nice elements but is the best variation on Clue I've found, so if that type of game interests you, you should probably check this one out.

Impression after one play -- could go up after repeated play.  Interesting mix of game mechanics.  However, left me somewhat dissatisfied due to two factors:  1)  There were some seeming imbalance in the power of the characters that gave some experienced players who knew to hire them a leg up.  2) The luck factor involved in lucky guesses renders strategy and deep thinking sort of pointless.  However, this is only after one play, so I do see potential improvement over more tries.  Sadly, I do not own this game, nor do I feel compelled after the first try to obtain it.

RATING: 5.5
It claims to be a German-style game, but that's far from the truth. It's a typically fiddly American game that blatantly rips off the deduction mechanic from "Clue". The only thing that vaguely relates it to German games is that there is an auction for hunters you want to hire. The auction has an original element, though, in that you pay with shares of your future bounties. I like how the backs of the various decks form a map, but that's completely irrelevant to gameplay, and it really is just a card game. The cards are large and the sturdiest I've ever seen, but the artwork certainly could be a lot better. The game does not scale well with the number of players, and the rulebook itself states three is best.

Designing anything is an iterative process, and I think this game needed quite a few more iterations before it should have been published.  The base system of hiring adventurers for shares and using them for adventuring or probing for the prophecy might be a good system for a deduction game, but it's poorly executed here.  There are multiple "official variant" rules that the designers made after the fact, but are not included in the game and not posted on the publisher's website, without which the game breaks in some situations.  The deduction is mildly fun, but not much more challenging than what is required by Clue.  No thought at all was given to what could have been done to improve the game for a player count besides three.  There are some interesting ideas in here, but overall, everything about this game feels amateurish.

This game definitely has some interesting mechanics.  Once players warm up to all the variables and chaos from special powers, the game is a good strategic romp.  I love the share system and the rulebook is the best I've ever seen included with a game.  Speaking of which, the production quality is extremely high and not just for an independent gaming company.  The cardstock is easily better than most major publishers (except for minor incidences of warping).

Ok game if you like clue with some spice.  Some of the rules when you first play are hard to understand and then make sense later in the game.  1st game should not be counted as a legit game as when comes to finding and fighting the shadow as I said before some of the rules are just unclear and not worded appropriately.

While this game does have a few interesting mechanics (the share system, most notably) the weak artwork and difficult-to-read print really detracts from the play experience. Also, the key to the game is knowing all of the characters's abilities and who combines well with who, and I'm just not interested enough to study it. I played the game with some late grade school/junior high kids and they really seemed to like it.

[b][i]Award: Best Strategy Game[/b][/i]

Interactive game of building a party together using bidding shares (euro) and prophecy solving (clue). Improve your party with hunters (MTG) and sabotage other parties.

[b]Hard for beginner players to pick up [/b]the strategy because of various character abilities. Rule of maximum gold needs to be appended so players actually try to solve the prophecy instead of mass agent kiling.

I believe it's a superior game due to the [b]numerous strategies to victory[/b].  Not to mention how damn good the card quality is. The wood pieces could use an upgrade though.

Initially thought that a 2 player game is unplayable, but it turns out a [b]2-player game is far superior to a 3-player game[/b]. Much faster, better interaction, much more control of the game, and much easier to learn strategies.

An interesting twist on the deduction game genre. The basic idea is quite simple (as in Clue), but some unique mechanisms like the pie-share work really well to give the game some extra flavour.

There are two games I absolutely love: Mystery (deduction) and Adventure. I never thought I'd see the two meet and meet so successfully. I cannot say that if I'm in the mood for a good adventure game that I would choose Hunting Party to play, nor would it be my first choice for when I'm really needing a mystery game (in otherwords, it's not the best game in those specific categories) but as an overall playing experience I was blown away. The first time through may be clunky but experienced groups can really get into bluffing and alternate strategies that make this game fun on a thoughtful level as well as imagination. This game eeks both theme and playability. The greatest surprise I've had in the gaming world in a long long time.

Clue meets Runebound? First you must determine what skills are needed to get at the bad guy while trying to collect those skills. Put together a part of hunters equip them with items and potions and set out on your quest. The game has some odd things to it like when you kill a monster and you get an item you still have to pay for the item... Some of the hunters seem a little overpowered such as the ability to see the hidden clues that others players posess.

Love some parts of this game.  Other seem needlessly frustrating.  For instance, my character hated men, so any men I hired cost 1 extra "share'.  With only 8 shares to go around, it was almost impossible to get anyone worthwhile, as a bid of 2 against me, meant I would have to put half of my worth into getting said character.

Provisional rating; the components are excellent quality, though somewhat overproduced; this is basicaly a deck of cards and some counters.  The backs of the cards join up to make the map of the kindgdom, which is a very nice touch; the quality of tyhe artwork isnt up to Magic: the Gathering standards, which bothered the other players more than it did me.  There are lots of intersting decisions - large party or lots of shares; spend that money on equipment and abilities, or hoard it in order to win.

On first showing, defeating the Shadow was rather anticlimactic; but I suspect that's more down to my expectations than anything else.

RATING: N/A
Hunting Party is a rather bizarre little game. Think Munchkin meets Cluedo meets Medici with a hint of Glory to Rome maybe? The goal is to assemble the eponymous "hunting party" to locate, track, and defeat the "Shadow" terrorizing the land. You do this by piecing together bands of RPG style characters who each have 2 skills out of 3 categories, with 1 of 4 possible abilities within each category. Thematically, one is the location [4 possible] of the Shadow [so the Druid knows how to search the Darkwoods, for instance, as one of his skills], one is the seeking / tracking skill [4 possible] required to find him, and the last is the kind of weapon [4 possible] needed to defeat him.

You figure out what exact combination the Shadow has in each particular game through a deduction mechanism reminiscent of Cluedo; you propose ["accuse"] a particular hunting party from your band of merry men, and anyone who can "thwart" ["disprove"] your proposition shows you a card from their hand that effectively says "No, that's not where the Shadow is / how you find the Shadow / how you kill the Shadow". First to put together a party that can find and kill the Shadow gets a huge bounty of gold and ends the game, but doesn't necessarily win as it's gold rather than defeating the Shadow that is the victory condition and there are a number of other ways to earn gold.

The deduction part is extremely simple and is not the heart of the game, despite thematic importance. Rather, what really drives the game are the unique powers available to every hunter in the game [in addition to the 2 skills each has] and the bidding mechanism for hiring new hunters into your party. The hunter powers are relatively well chosen and have a very wide range of effects, despite there being only 36 different hunters in the game. The powers interact together in sometimes unexpectedly powerful ways, and many different combinations and strategies are possible, I'm sure, once you know what's in the deck. The combo play in general reminds me of Glory To Rome in that a small number of very powerful effects combine in all sorts of ways to create even bigger effects.

Unlike games like Munchkin, however, where you can just luck into an uber-combo, you have to work to piece it together here by bidding against other players for any hunter you want to add to your party. This is easily the most interesting part of the game, and it's actually a really clever and very thematic auction system. You essentially bid against future earnings rather than with current assets. You have 8 "shares" available to bid with; what these represent is how much of the bounty for successful quests [there are small sidequests in addition to the main "defeat the Shadow" quest] you're willing to give up in order to have a particular hunter in your party to help you complete the quest. Thematically, it represents the "piece of the pie" [the "shares" are even shaped like pie wedges] that you promise to the mercenary hunters you hire in return for their help in tracking down the Shadow.

How it works is that you flip over a hunter from one of a number of different hiring pools [you have some information on the back of the cards telling you what fighting skills, at least, they're likely to possess] and then engage in a once-around auction for the right to hire that hunter. The player willing to give up the largest "share" of the bounty from future quests [who bids the most "share" pieces] gets the hunter and places an appropriate number of "shares" on top of the card. Whenever you complete a quest in the future and earn a gold bounty, the amount you actually receive is a fraction of the whole based on how many "shares" you kept for yourself [instead of promising to the hunters you hired]. It's some rather awkward math, with each "share" representing 1/8 of the bounty, but it works; multiply the total bounty by X/8 where X is the number of unassigned "shares" you still possess, and that's how much you as the player receive [remember, gold is how you win]. The remaining gold [which you never see] is thematically distributed to your hired hands according to their promised "shares".

The trick is to get a great hunting party assembled with as few "shares" [as low a bid at auction] as possible distributed to them. There are a number of cool tricks built into the game to help with this. First, your hunters die if you take them on a quest and fail; this is sometimes desirable, as it's the easiest way to get rid of someone who has outlived their usefulness, so that you can reclaim their share of the bounty. Second, you can pay your hunters off to "disband" them from your party; it costs a gold coin for each share on the hunter's card in order to disband them [note: death of a hunter doesn't cost you any coins]. Third, there are a number of character powers that play around with the number of shares required to bid on hunters or allow you to remove or add shares after you [or someone else] has already obtained a hunter. This all amounts to a rather clever, and tight, economic management system which is extraordinarily thematic to boot. Well done. A little bit longer game length, and a little bigger "pie" to split up would have done well here.

This game seemed to be much of the same thing from turn to turn.  Hire, hire, hire then hunt, hunt, hunt, then someone wins.  Also for the limited amount of actions, the game lasts a little longer than desired.  The card stock is of poor quality, and this game has a high use of cards, in fact it's all cards.  They will show wear very quickly.  Would have much prefered basic cards, for ease in shuffling and lack of warping.  The characters abilities were sometimes unclear, overpowered, or what-would-I-ever-use-that-for.  Lastly the screens for the game are horribly done, but this is easily remedied by just using paper without the screens, and concocting your own tracking mechanism.  I want to give the game another try, as I do think it has some redeemable qualities.

Aie. I bought this game as a Christmas present for Neil. We both like adventure type scenarios which give a little D&D feel but overall, our playing experience was hampered my tedious churning through different game mechanics. 

I love the cheesy fantasy art a la MS Paint - it reminds me of high school - well done.

I'm hoping a second go at this game will reveal some overlooked dynamic in which we can lose ourselves for a couple of hours of geeky fantasy.

In terms of raw theme and concept, you can't really knock Hunting Party. It's built a Cluedo-style deduction on a rock solid dungeon-crawler, with plenty of flavour text and flavour-art. Unfortunately, the assortment of special abilities haven't - it feels - been adequately tested against each other, and it's too easy to stumble onto something that is virtually broken.

I want to like it a lot, and from a thematic point of view I do, but it has shortcomings as a game.

RATING: N/A
Bought 4 copies!
Some highlights:
Expect 30 minutes per player.  There are several +/- handicap hunters so that veterans can play with noobs while keeping the game challenging for both veterans and noobs alike.  The rulebook is the shiznat haderach!  They spent 8 months on the rulebook alone. Each section is tabbed for easy access and presents each concept in the order that the player would come across during normal gameplay in a very intuitive fashion. Each turn has a tab! In addition their website has a sweet demo of the game and also presents the rules quite splendidly.

The hunters seem to be balanced very well.  Grouping a necro with a priest can expectedly be more costly to do.  How fitting!  There are enough character types that the player can expect each game to play differently than the last.
Also added is a little more theme in the form of backstories and such.  Kudos all around!

*edit
Was promised updated non-warping cards plus signatures by the owners-ceo and neither materialised.  Ah well.

Only played this once, and my rating is based on the fact the game was over almost as soon as it began because an opponent 'fluked' the prophecy and ended the game. Really need to try it again...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's nice that it's optimised for 3 (not sure it's even worth playing with different); although that will limit the opportunities to play. Not sure how representative of a first game ours was, the Prophecy seemed to be uncovered very quickly and then it became a race to acquire the necessary skills - we were expecting more of a discovery game a la Cluedo or Mystery of the Abbey.
Some of the characters seem to have 'niggly' powers that while not gamebreakers just prove as irritants, but again, maybe that was just the game we had.
High quality components and the fantasy theme means it appeals to a few of our group.

Una buona idea - azzardo un "vagamente autoironica" - che lascia un po' di amaro in bocca. La varietà dei personaggi è impressionante, tanto da voler reclutare anche solo per lo sfizio di vedere cosa nasconde il mazzo. La raccolta di indizi sulla profezia è cluediana e si esaurisce molto prima che il gioco arrivi alla conclusione. Il risultato è che nell'attesa i turni si passano accumulando il necessario per ammazzare l'Ombra (e mettendo qualche bastone tra le ruote agli avversari). Inoltre, sembra difficile doversi riorganizzare (per rimediare a un errore, cambiare personaggi perché inutili contro l'Ombra, ecc.), col rischio di rimanere fuori partita per svariati turni, attaccandosi al deus ex machina delle carte mercato o reclutamento. Poi, la differenza di poteri tra i personaggi principali è molto ampia, a scapito del bilanciamento del gioco. Infine, una nota personale: per i miei gusti, ci sono troppi poteri, skill, bonus! Mi ricorda più "Magic: the Gathering" che un "Fantasy americano che incontra il Boardgame tedesco".

RATING: 5
Really a nice production, pretty and well constructed, but the game is a bit lacking.  It's basically a clue mechanism of "find the missing card" and there are special abilities and such, but in the end all of the other mechanisms contribute more to making the game convoluted than adding to the challenge.  Clue is the better game.

Very well-made game with many special abilities. Feels innovative, too. It has one problem, though: it's completely broken. Everyone I have played it with thought it was really cool, and wanted to play it again, and sincerely hoped it would actually work this time. Hunting Party just begs for some good house rules. Some ideas that I have recently wanted to try include: a) When you auction off a hunter, you may immediately buy them outright for 4 shares. b) You can't have more than $15.c) You can only use potions of destruction and stealing on your own turn. d) When you auction, you can auction a second hunter after the first.e) Items cost $2 each.f) Whenever a player defeats a monster, everyone gets $1.

Ok, yeas, the core mechanic of the game is ripped off from Clue/Cluedo. Players are trying to build a party in an attempt to nail bad guys and ultimately decipher the identity of the Shadow (which gives the person 40 gold). What really makes this game is everything else built around it.

Each turn, players can take 1 action (recruit, take on a challenge or buy items). The euro element comes in the form of an interesting bidding system. Players are actually using their share of treasure to bid for adventurers. The more you bid, the less gold you get when you successfully kill a bad guy as you have to share treasure. The adventurers you hire give you skills needed to kill other bad guys for more gold and information to take on the Shadow.

There are nice little things to do and it zips along fairly speedily. However, I belive that some characters and equipment are much stronger than others. I will post a thread shortly. All up, I like how the elements mesh together and there's a nice tension as people race to find the Shadow.

Negatives: The artwork is terrible, the cards in the copy I played warped the day after it was opened, the wooden bits are rough. Despite what the rules or box says, it's best with 3.

I wanted to like this game. I read the reviews, so we played with exactly three players. But the game didn't live up to potential. The Clue aspect was too familiar, and thus not that interesting. Recruiting characters was kind of fun, but too many special abilities revolved around the share system, making the game seem shallow in design. Maybe it would have been more fun if combat had some greater depth or even some dice-rolling.

I was unimpressed by this game.  It seemed to take a dull game, Clue, and add a bunch of stuff that didn't make it any more fun, just made it take longer.

RATING: 6
Deduction, Adventure. Interesting take on a fantasy deduction game. The deduction portion is like Clue, except you must have the appropriate skills in your hunting party in order to Hunt (analogous to making an accusation in Clue), except when you're wrong (which you often are, while fishing for clues) you face an attack by a Dark Agent.

I really like the shares system used for hiring; you spend more shares outbid opponents to hire hunters, but then you get less of the rewards when defeating foes.

Initial rating of 6.5; I'd like to play it some more to firm up a rating. Knowing what's going on now, I think I'll enjoy the second play a lot more.

Traded after it never saw the table again in a couple of years.

I really want to like this, and it was fun the first half dozen plays. But nowadays it's even hard to convince people in my game group to play this. The characters, art, abilities, and play are fun enough most of the time. But it suffers from a couple of problems:

1) Someone can have practically won the game, but it doesn't end. It's possible for someone to essentially have won already (have a large set of decent, well defended, cheap hunters), yet the other players can keep throwing themselves on the sword (for instance, bidding 7 shares on the hunter the "winner" really needs, then losing their next turn to kill that hunter off) to stop them from winning. Drags the game on forever until everyone gets sick of playing and decides not to stop the winner finally. This can be partially helped by capping the gold you can have at any time, but that seems fiddly/artificial and it only partially helps.

2) Unbalance between starting heroes and other hunters. There's not much to do about unbalance of heroes - we slightly temper this by letting each player pick between 2, but even then you can sometimes get the shaft. Unbalance between other hunters can be helped by bidding, but only 8 shares means it's not always granular enough, and hate factors in as well.

3) Can drag on. Again, there's variants to help but they don't always help enough and can feel artificial.

This has some very interesting mechanics and nice components.  However, the endgame tends to feel a bit tedious; sometimes each player is just drawing to try to get some skill that they need, and the game is not terribly interesting at that point.  I am willing to give it more tries to see if that gets reduced with experience, but the other big downside for it is that its optimal for 3 players, a number I almost never have to play with.

One short game I won completely as a fluke; one long game I just hoped would end.  No sense of accomplishment on the deduction aspect; combinations of character powers that seemed too weak or too powerful.  Reasonably good quality of components; lacking in art and typography.  Reasonably good iconic displays next to ugly compositions of text.  Can't totally write it off, but too many conflicts of good here, bad there, have me waiting until a second edition before trying it again.

Patrick demoed this game to us several months ago.  It seemed interesting, although we did not get to play a full game.
Likes: Offering shares for your party members is a new concept to me, and works very well.
How forming a party yields interesting combinations.
Dislikes: I am not sure how I will like the endgame, which is clue-ish.
I am unsure whether I will like the large size of the cards.

I need to play a full game before giving it a rating.

A deduction/building game. Luckily the deduction part is minimal because I'm not a big fan of those.

A better knowledge of the rules and a copy of the FAQ would have made this more enjoyable. I wouldn't be against trying it again.

German Stategy meets American Fantasy! Players race to kill the Dark Agents and solve the prophecy by building the destined party from 36 unique Hunters. Players will hire hunters by bidding with shares of the King's Bounty. These hunters will give players the skills they need to hunt, and the abilities to make a difference. With your share of the bounty, you can buy items that will increase your party's skills, abilities, or even level up your hunters into champions. Ideal with three players, but it works with two.

The good:  Everything works well, and it is a fun system.  Lots of special abilities work together relatively intuitively and figuring out the prophecy is enjoyable.

The bad:  The game drags.  Figuring out the prophecy is the fun part.  Then, the game turns into a grind to find all the stuff you need to actually kill the shadow.  At this point, the game can really overstay its welcome.

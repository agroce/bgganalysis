Richelieu is a tug of war’ish race to capture the majority of cards in a number of categories. Scoring is based on “winner takes it all concept” which I personally do not fancy too much because once one player manages to get the absolute majority in one category all the rest of the cards of that category still in play become useless. This narrows down the number of meaningful moves quite drastically. Richelieu would be a fully deterministic game without the extra markers which add some guesswork and uncertainty to the scoring.  Reminds me of Shanghaien without the luck of dice rolls. There are no major design flaws and there is some fun to be had, but in the end Richelieu is not very inspiring.

this one really surprised me.  i wasn't impressed at first, but after several plays on mabiweb.com i ended up grabbing a copy on ebay.  nice and quick.  try it online a few times yourself!  i realized i wouldn't end up playing it in person so i traded it away.  the first player advantage in the game bugs me, as does a bit of monotony.  it's still a good design though, and one i'd probably enjoy even more in an online real-time play format.

This one's a very easy to learn game. The rules are incredibly simple. However, it might take more than a few plays to finally "click the gears". That's, in the end, a good thing.

However, the game does suffer from a very wide scoring system. While the scoring itself is very easy to determine, the fact that you score in so many categories can (and does) distract you from what's actually going on.

I like the game. It's just not one I long to play again and again. And this, on a game I haven't played before (and me, being really excited to try new games) is not a good sign. It might even drop it's rating in the future if it's longevity is as short as I think it is.

Tactical 2er card game. Scoring is a bit convoluted but plays exceedingly well online at SpielbyWeb.

RATING: 9
A knife fight disguised as a set collection/majorities game. It cuts deepest when the blocking tokens are used to their fullest extent. The hidden bonus chips are added incentives for players; they tip the sharp balance in favour of one player or the other. Most people dismiss this as "too simple" or as having a "tacked on theme"--bah. Nonsense.

Fantastic 2-player game form Schacht.  Great material for the "cards" (actually, cardboard as in Carcassonne tiles).  Very interesting game full of little decisions about which card to get for your collection.  Like the variant of scoring after 3 rows are completed.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2011/12/richelieu.html]Richelieu[/url] es el mejor juego de “control de áreas” y mayorías diseñado para dos jugadores al que he jugado. Su sencillez, su profundidad, su posibilidad de desarrollar estrategias y lo táctico que es a la vez, es lo que mas me cautiva. Tomar cartas de una fila, implica hacer a otras disponibles para el contrincante. El bloqueo de los chips es muy interesante, dotando al juego de puteo, las 8 fichas ocultas al inicio del juego confieren incertidumbre y faroleo a la hora de interpretar quienes tiene las mayorías por las que se esta luchando.

Richelieu es un juego abstracto donde el cálculo y recálculo de las opciones puede echar atrás algún jugador pero si buscas un juego sólido para dos de mayorías y con mucha iteración este es altamente recomendable.

RATING: 8.5
Richelieu is an elegant 2P card game. You lay out all the cars in a 4x12 grid, and can only collect from the two ends of the grid.... almost like Dvonn in some way like that, the board opens from the edges. The scoring is a battle of trying to collect the most pips (shields) in different suits while competing for majorities in symbols (swords, castles, crosses) that spread across the suits. Add in some random facedown chits of the different suited pips and symbols to make it not entirely abstract and that's the scoring. 

I think its a fine game. Almost abstract in its simplicity... the card selection takes on an almost card drafting feel combined with the tough decision of exposing valuable cards for your opponent with every card you take. I'm not sure much will change game to game, but this is a nice piece of game design.


*Still enjoying this one. Got to play against another opponent and it held up really well. Quick to start and among the simplest rules you could imagine for a set collection game... It's one of my favorite two player games and maybe my favorite set collection game among those.

--------------------------

After several plays, scoring is very vanilla, its no Knizia game.

RATING: 6
The only things to remember when playing this is that getting shut out of a zone is fatal (so prioritise the rarer areas), it's better to lose an area x to 1 than to lose it closely, and you usually want to get as many symbols as possible on your turn.

These simple rules make the game feel a little formulaic and thus not all that exciting.

There is a bit more here than meets the eye at first glance. I've only played it online...and I think it helps to have a running total of the score break-down easily visible. I could imagine that the game on the table might be a bit harder to evaluate.

There's no theme...and its dry, but its quick and fun. Its ideally suited for online implementation. I'd be willing to play this face to face, but don't think I'd go out of my way to obtain a copy. Although there might be a first-turn advantage, its somewhat mitigated by the limitation of not being able to take two cards with the first play and the variable ending.

I really enjoy the tactical of feel of playing a card, watching your opponent counter it, and then you countering them. All this while blocking cards that either you need or do not want them to get.

It's weird, from reading the rules, it seemed like it almost doesn't matter what you do, but in my one playing with my 7-year old, I crushed him, which is to say nothing for me, but bodes well for the game. I'm still not sure how I did it, but the game intrigues me.

RATING: 7
The game is quite interesting but the theme is really just tacked on. To play in the spirit of the game you should make your moves fairly quickly rather than calculating everything. Although, to be fair, the 8 hidden discs do make it impossible to know for sure what the other player has.

Playing the game the second time was much more enjoyable and I have upped my rating. It is very fast to play and quite interesting.

Excellent tactical, look-ahead card/tile game with some moments of really good turn angst.  The property markers offer some interesting tactical options in blocking, devaluing tiles and even a bit of bluffing, while the bonus discs provide a little hidden information to discourage AP.  The tiles are thick and sturdy; when setting up, I like to mix them face-down on the table like mahjong tiles.  Richelieu is an excellent Lunch Hour Game; light enough you can play two or three games in an hour, but with enough meat to be satisfying.  Lunch Hour Game of the Week, 04/24-04/28.

Essentially the same game as Kardinal und Koenig: das Kartenspiel.  Two players take turns claiming cards from the ends of a 12x4 grid.  Cards have symbols on them and majorities of these symbols score points.  That's about it.  Making it two player only is a definite improvement, as well as doing away with the -2 points "bonus" tiles!

[Drafting, Set collection] [2P:6] An interesting little game of stalling, or as I like to call it, negative timing. The rhythm of the game requires players to claim cards they want while at the same time preventing their opponents from getting cards that would hurt them. The addition of the random face-down tokens and the property markers puts enough of a twist on the gameplay to make it interesting. The scoring is also unusual - you either have a majority of each of the 12 symbols and you score that number, or you have nothing. Nada. Zilch. Short enough to play in 15 minutes, simple enough to teach in three. Not bad at all. *** UPDATE: Upgraded to 6. I like it quite a bit. Now to find a copy of my own.

Well... only mildly interesting. But with such open information this game just screams as a super dry routine where you can either analyze the other player's cards to death in order to choose the best card, or just ignore the other players, try to play your best, and then just hope for the best.  There is a shade of fun here trying to beat your friends on symbols, but the game is so super dry that it actually feels like a light chore. I rarely complain about a game feeling dry.

Richelieu is a card-drafting set collection game reminiscent of Combit and Buried Treasure (but much better than the latter).  It's all about lookahead, timing, momentum, prioritization, and zugzwang.  Richelieu began its life as Kardinal and König Das Kartenspiel, and all the changes are for the better: production values, simplification of the bonus tokens, overall streamlining, and limiting the game to two players.  Yes, issuing Richelieu as a two-player only game is an improvement rather than a limitation; the original game just didn't work properly with more than two players.  The "variant" wherein the game ends after three rows are exhausted should be considered the standard method of play.

Un divertido y adictivo juego de cartas con cero presencia de azar (la única información oculta son las fichas que permanecen volteadas), y en el cual hay que ir tomando condados (cartas de distintos colores y valores) teniendo cuidado con las posibilidades que se abren al contrario. 

Una mecánica que adoro es la de los tokens que bloquean cartas al rival, los cuales tienen un gran componente estratégico y de interacción.

This is an interesting 2-player set collection game, where players may only take a certain number of tile-symbols per round.  Players also have a limited power to disincent some tiles; it doesn't prevent them from being taken, but the other player is forced to give up disincentive to do so.

A very simple game at first perception, which doesn't seem to play out quite as simply as it seems to.

Starting this at 6.75 based on 2 solo plays. This may well go up with additional plays, particularly if it appeals to my wife and/or daughter as well.

It seems a very solid little game, almost a basic card game with added complications, but it makes one think quite a bit for that.

A handful of cards and some counters give you the same depth as many majority Euros there. Richelieu is not only faster, it has also pretty colors!

I think this is a pretty decent two player game, and I wouldn't mind adding it to the "play with the significant other" list.  It's not really that confrontational, and it can have interesting choices.  My only complaint is that when you start out your choice set is so large that the game is slow in the beginning as you try and figure out something good to do.

This took me by surprise.  Simple, short card drafting/set collection game for two.  Plays quickly and cleanly. The hidden information forces you to hedge your bets, but there is certainly enough open information (at least online) to make for a high degree of skill.  I like it. (1 play, online)

Ideal Players: 2

Description: Players take turns claiming tiles and reserving them for future turns. Only the one with the majority of a tile scores points for it, but each player gets negative points for having none of a particular type.

Pro: Easy to explain and play. Surprisingly deep strategy. Plays quickly, with lots of replayability.

Con: May be too abstract for some gamers.

Good little quick weeknight abtract for 2 players with simple rules and lots to think about, mostly concerning your property marker, those placements are key and can be quite tricky at times.  

Some strategy, some tactics, just a little luck with the hidden bonuses, the one giving you a discarded marker back is big but not too big.  Scoring works well although it miffed me at first as I thought the cards with only 5 shields would score more than the more plentiful ones and that’s how they were numbered in the rules only that was for the scoring ORDER only.  

I smell a house rule to mix things up.  Would also like to try the official 3 or 4 player game to see if it can cut it as a filler for 3 or 4.  Will update.

I guess I've never played a game that could be described as a "light majority card game". So it is a bit different. Still, the game play isn't all that exciting. Take one or two cards from the tableau to put in front of you. Repeat. The strategic difference maker are the three reserve tiles, which can make taking a particular card costly for your opponent. Fine game, but nothing all that speacial.

Juego de cartas para 2 que está descatalogado, pero que por internet se juega genial (incluso se da la opción de jugar hasta 4 en alguna página).

Fun little two player game.  Forget about the theme, which is ridulously pasted on.  I can see why it may be a little better to play this on a computer, having it track the scores for you, as it is very difficult to monitor who is ahead in each category.  In fact, I would not want to play with a player that dragged too much, counting each category as we go.  For a quick filler, it can be kind of fun.

Richelieu is game for two players. Interesting mechanic, because all cards (48) are visible from the start to the end. So lot of thinking ahead and you have to react your opponents movements. Some randomly chosen hidden bonuses brings a nice surprise element to the game. Richelieu has only one - but BIG - problem: the game is too dry and that's why I'm ready to play this very rarely.

Just like Wallenstein, Cardinal Richelieu is another great game subject on a political/ religious/ military leader in the Thirty Years War.  Richelieu was a leader who led France into war for the Protestant cause to stop Imperial Catholic aggression in Bavaria after the death of Swedish Gustavus II ("Lion of the North"), thus brining the war into the final stage.   An irony to the Catholic since France was predominatly a Catholic country (really nobody can understand the French mind).  I have interest in this game because of my growing interest in the War itself.

Not necessary - the K&K Card Game is plenty enough, even for 2 players.

But... it has been nicely simplified (slightly), just a tad smaller (less cards) and is quicker (barely). Turns out that I like the 'simplification'. It is largely simplified around the scoring, which doesn't require as much paper to write on as K&K does.

There are now 3 extra scoring options (the ruling symbols) as opposed to the 2 in K&K (the shipping symbols). I have come around to liking the new symbols better (not in their look, silly, but in the game play).

The game starts with a grid of 4 rows and 12 columns of cards. Each card has a number of shields corresponding to a province and maybe a symbol. Players collect 1 or 2 cards during their turn, collecting from the outside and starting inwards. Players may collect 2 cards if they are of the same province and at most 2 shields. Players then may place one of their 3 tokens to reserve a card. An opponent could return your token by permanently giving up one of theirs. 

For the provinces, the scoring is all or nothing. Whoever has the majoroty scores the number of shields, the loser gets nothing. If you have no shields, you lose 5 VPs.  The same is applied to the 3 different symbols. 

The wrinkle here is that some cards have an extra bonus token which can grant an extra shield or symbol, or an extra token.

It's an okay game. I only played once, but there is room for tactics. My concern is that the bonus tokens might add more luck.

RATING: 7
A pleasant but very quiet and assessing type 2 player. It's all about calculating more moves in advance than the other player, with almost perfect information and fair wads of think time as a result. It's a straight pick up sets game, where you'll be continually weighing up which sets to go for (ie outnumber your opponent in) and what not. Placement of your reservation markers is crucial in an attempt to get double turns (where you can acquire two cards in the same colour) and getting more double turns than your opponent can be key. When to force a discard of an opponent's reservation marker at the cost of 1 of your own markers for the rest of the game is another difficult decision throughout. The reward of luck is limited to collection of some facedown counters that will add to sets, which may be just right or not enough luck depending on whether you're playing with gamers or non-gamers respectively. There's enough look ahead to ensure you need to pay attention, but there’s no theme. It doesn't provide much room for social chat during the game, which limits the times it comes out, but it plays very well on Yucata where you can have the think time you need.

A set collection game where you want to be first in the each of 9 suits and 2 symbols - but but want to make sure that you do not yield too many points when you lose. 
  
The shared draw pile is set up in a 4x12 grid where you have to work from the outside in. You have a limited number of reservation markers that prevent the other player from picking up the card unless he discards one of his markers.
The hidden information of the 8 makers, so you are not exactly sure of the opponents strength and the reservation system is what gives the game its interest.

For a game that's this dry and abstract, I really love this.

Interesting enough, lots of counting required, but in the interest of a quick game you don't. It feels like there should be an earlier end of game trigger - something like the game ending once the first row is cleared. Otherwise it just seems a bit chaotic near the end.

Richelieu, by Michael Schacht, is a two-player card game version of Web of Power that was originally released as a PnP. Cards are dealt into a tableau of 4 rows. On your turn, you can collect 1 or 2 cards (depending upon the number of "Shield" icons on the cards) from the ends of the rows. The object of the game is to collect majorities in various card colours (French provinces) while also collecting majorities in 3 realms of influence (military, political, and religious). The game is highly abstract and dry, but the decisions are interesting and occasionally challenging, particularly when your choice of card to collect may expose a more valuable card for your opponent.

Good two player game if you like analytical games. There is a bit of luck in regard to the tokens, but the luck factor is minimal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An excellent and (I think) under-appreciated card game for two players. The use of markers for reserving cards and the scoring mechanisms make this a very tense and strategic game.

RATING: 7
Took me a couple of plays to get a grasp on how it worked, but I'm quite liking it now, even though the game is pretty much themeless. It's interesting how you both have to consider what's best to take at the time while thinking forward about what it would open up for your opponent to take, or how it could possibly open up better cards for you, etc.

[2 plays] Very abstract card drafting game. I found it to have decent depth and challenge. I liked it. If I get to play it more, I expect my rating will settle in at 7 or 8 as a game I'd be happy to play anytime.

Most recent play 1-25-06 with David Rapp.

Played once so far, I really like this as a filler card drafting / set collection / majority scoring game. Glad I printed off my own set of cards.

[Owned: a retheme of this I printed on Artscow based on my steam fantasy setting, called Iskanbul.]

Finally a game that emulates the struggle between Mary of Medici and Cardinal Richelieu...oh wait, no it is just laying out cards and picking up colors.  I liked it enough.  There were fun decisions, but ultimately, I put my brain on autopilot for fear that it would become a min/max fest.  I would imagine that one could discover more and more about this game, unveiling deeper strategies, but I also imagine that after 10 plays the game won't reveal much more and will collect dust.  Let's see if my suspicions hold true.

I have played this game online a half-dozen times in the past two days (http://www.mabiweb.com) and liked it so much I purchased a hard copy. The more I play, the more I like it and get engrossed in the strategy. An absolutely fantastic two player game. Underrated and under appreciated.

Abstract set-collection game. Better online (PBW at mabiweb.com) because it's easier to track what the total points are at any moment.

Rules
- Lay out 4 rows of 12 cards
- Shuffle 12 face down discs; place 8 face down on the cards 
- Each player gets 3 property markers
- The cards may only be taken from the outside, a maximum of two of the same shields with each move 
- Place a maximum of 1 property marker per move (can move previously placed marker if none left in your stock)
- Taking a card with an opponent's marker costs you one of your own
- Game ends when all cards taken; variant (2er): ends when 3 rows taken.
- Scoring: For each region and each symbol, player with a majority score 1VP per shield; -5VP per _region_ with no shields.
- Winner: most VP. Tiebreaker = lower number of cards. 

3-4 player variant:
- all players get 3 ownership markers, although may only have 2 in play at any time
- Scoring: all players with most shields of a type score as many points; no -5VP penalty; for each different _region_ collected,  2VP

I was first introduced to this game on www.mabiweb.com. I enjoy the area control effect with the cards and the secret markers. I enjoyed it so much, I tracked down a copy to play in person. Now that www.Yucata.de has added it, I play even more.

PNP . Looks good.  The game play is fun, but the scoring really deflates the enjoyment of the game.  It's never fun to count, count , count to win.  Nice little time pass.

Update : Upon further play I have come to enjoy this game more.  I still don't like counting up the score but winning symbols is a nice alternative to shields and ups the enjoyment of the countdown.

update : We play with the 3 rows variant and with the now correct rule of hiding the bonus disks.  Much more tension.  I have to say I completely suck at this.

Nice two-player adaptation of Schacht's little-known but amazing "Kardinal & König - Das Kartenspiel." The Kardinal & König card game, which is designed for three to five players, is the better game, but with a large publisher behind it this is far more readily available and is one of the more interesting two-player games out there. This one is well worth trying ...

Brilliant abstract for two players. Short and sweet and very suspenseful. Granted, it may not look like much (and so it took a while before I got it on the table), but if you do not mind abstracts, I really recommend giving this a try. And it's quite portable too, with sturdy components.

The "journée des dupes", in 1630, when Mary of Medici tried to have the young Louis the XIIIth dismiss the Cardinal of Richelieu. 
All the cards are placed face up on the game table, in 4 rows. Players, in turn, can take one or two cards at the end of the rows, the goal being to have the majority of cards in each colour, as well as with some symbols.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Tricky 2 player game where each player competes to gain the most influence in Europe.  Players choose from face-up cards to attempt to gain majorities in each of the card suits.  Games are fast, close, and there are lots of neat decisions to make.

Played the game about 15 or so times, I reckon I probably know most of the subtleties to this game. Not to say this ain't a great game. I think, it's very successful in the 2 player game field..probably not as replayable as some games such as San Juan, but the rules are stripped right back to make a game that is easy for anyone to learn in 5 mins but is also something for the gamers too..well done again mr schacht!

RATING: 6.5
A quick set-collecting game with a few extra elements that include small amounts of treachery. I love the fact that this game lacks any random elements whatsoever. The players control their fate entirely, and can very drastically reduce the chances of their opponent's either winning or catching up with a few thought-out moves and token placements. I won this on an auction here on BGG, and am quite pleased with my win.

I've only played it a few times (on MabiWeb) but liked the "competitive drafting" of cards for scoring. I think the F2F would be a bit clunky, since it wouldn't be as easy to organize all the drafted cards and icons like it is online. Neat, quick little game, tho.

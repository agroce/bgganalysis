RATING: 7
Great as a standalone or expansion. Tons of replay value. Epic variant lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Really nice to have a set of basic cards - a selection from the old-style Thunderstone. The artwork is lovely too.

It is odd that AEG keep releasing new base-games for Thunderstone instead of expansions, making the game expensive and causing a lot of wastage of unnecessary boards and components.

I have come to like Thunderstone very much in its "Epic" variant form. In its original form, I found it very reminiscent of Dominion but not nearly as streamlined. It always outstayed its welcome. In the Epic format (mixing all cards into the game) I can indulge in a 2 hour adventure, and get caught up in the theme. It fulfils a very different need from Dominion. This format really requires multiple different sets though, to shine.

RATING: 8
Still haven't played this enough, but the "new" heroes are a lot of the more interesting Thunderstone heroes, and having ones with strong Level 1 & 2 (Dark, especially) helps to mitigate the craziness of Thunderstone Advance heroes which are...sometimes not well-designed and incredibly level dependent.  It's a nice expansion for people like me who have no interest in base Thunderstone, but still enjoy the "greatest hits".

Not quite as good a starter as the first Advance release, Towers of Ruin, but still very good. 

It lacks the familiars and the various curses have been replaced with basic diseases. There's also a larger number of screw your buddy cards than the previous Advance sets, which can be hit or miss depending on the group.

Still, very solid, and it's nice to see some more of the old cards making in into the new game for those of us that didn't start playing until Advance.

As much as we like Thunderstone Adv: ToR, the set of cards here in Worlds Collide is superior.  The characters, monsters, weapons, and villagers in particular are excellent as are the food items.  It's a bit weird that Curses are back to being Diseases and Familiars have disappeared.  We play with the inclusion of those ToR elements and it works well.  And since we play in Epic mode the addition of dividers for Epic card organization makes this set all the sweeter.

Takes TA to a 10.

Dominion was a great idea (deck building) but has an almost non-existent theme.  The deck building mechanism is just a central to this game, but you actually feel like you are going into a dungeon to kill bad guys.  Wonderful blend of theme and mechanism.

RATING: 9
The most immersive deckbuilder I have played. Players try to assemble a party of heroes and other assorted cards to delve into a dungeon and acquire VPs for killing monsters, but they need to be successful or the monster will run away and another will appear, until the Thunderstone bearer appears. Great variety in cards, and can be played either by drafting or with the scenarios that are provided in various sets, some of which are an absolute pain in the ass to progress through.

Was very enamored by the game at first, and then the more I played it, the more repetitive the games became. 

The art is great and the mechanics work well, but now that that the publisher AEG has completely lost interest in the game, it is impossible to get expansion boxes for a normal price. 

The setup and tear down is also quite lengthy. 

This game DESPERATELY needs to be on IOS/Android?PC. In the same vein as Ascencion the card game, Thunderstone the app, would probably do much better than its physical counterpart.

I've only bought Worlds Collide and Into The Abyss as I find the artwork beautiful, classic and consistent as opposed to other Advance releases (where most of the heroes are just big breasted chicks etc.) 
I think the old Thunderstone layout was actually much more epic and fantasy themed, though the font fits better now and what's most important the rules are clarified.
The game is light, very nice to play with two, three or four players (number of players doesn't change the game length) and you're mostly playing against the game so there isn't too much interaction. There are many ways to play the game- like epic version- even the instruction encourages to use your own ideas- so it can get longer/shorter, less/more competitive only based on the setup - which is a unique feature.
 The only thing I don't like about the game is the fact that some of the cards' properties work against the game's light and uncompetitive feeling. Such as those of thieves or monsters with "breach" effect- you can't base your tactics on them but from time to time they ruin someone else's tactics, and when it happens it's totally random. So it feels like players take part in an epic race but from time to time someone is randomly being tripped up... By accident...
:)
I think the game takes longer than the box says- I'd say if you think a lot while playing- it can take even two hours.
If someone is looking for the older classic experience of the first Thunderstone sets- get this and "Into The Abyss".

Thunderstone Advance: Worlds Collide tells the story of a battle for survival in a world of ancient evil and darkness. This set showcases 550 cards from the first six Thunderstone releases, including previously hard-to-find promos, all updated and fully compatible with Thunderstone Advance, along with many fan favorites from this deck-builder's history.

RATING: 8
The heaviest deck building game I have. I like the RPG mechanics where you can level up your characters after you defeat enemies. 
Only complaint I have is the enemies you defeat go into your deck and usually clog up your deck with useless cards.

RATING: 7
I really enjoy the mechanism of the game. 
Haven't tried the Epic play but would like to try it later.
Also only play at 2-players. 

Unfortunately that also means some of the cards don't work too well at 2-players.

So I would need to try:
- Epic Play
- More than 2 players.

This is a nice deck building game that feels very different than Dominion or Ascension.  Deck building strategies need to adjust to the particular strengths of the monsters being faced, which is very fun.  A dungeon crawl minus the sense of exploration, but it still feels thematic to me.  Good solitaire as well.

How hard can you squize the lemon? Very hard according to AEG. Not only contains this set just some cards from the 'first' Thunderstone-series, instead of making this an economic affordable expansion by just putting the cards in a small box together with dividers, no, they have to make this a big box with a board, XP-tokens and basic cards. My advice: give a signal and DON'T BUY THIS!!!

Never played the basic version (a.k.a. the "non-advance" version), so I cannot compare or comment on the differences. It is, in my opinion, a pretty solid deckbuilder. The theme is clearly more present than with the likes of Dominion.

As with any game in the genre, it can quickly become a mathematics exercise, but it is part of the fun of a deck builder, i.e. to find the best possible solution (best card pool to obtain in the village) to an ever-changing problem (the beasts of the dungeon). With a little imagination, it becomes a card-based dungeon crawler, which is fun and entertaining.

The rules are not too convoluted and anyone will get going by turn 2, and the randomizers help add some variety game after game.

*Rating not final*

As of right now, I've played this game 2 times, and I've to say that it is one solid deckbuilder game. 

In comparison to Dominion, Thunderstone Advance is what Dominion hoped it would blossom into. Instead dominion (with all of it's expansions) just became a deckbuilding exercise with little to no comparable theme and nothing to really strive for. 

Dominion is a game that I still love and enjoy but its fun factor comes in play with it's factory farming and multiple combo effects to show off to your opponents. 

As for Thunderstone, it is more fine tuned with the theme and it makes sense as well. 

One thing that may be in the way of a perfect score is how the villiage is handled and some of the cards look very odd to me but im not use to it yet. 

THINGS I LIKE BETTER IN THUNDERSTONE ADVANCE (compared to Dominion)*so far*:

- Better Theme 
- Better Art Work (very dark, thematic, and looks like dungeon material)
- Quality of the cards I would say are a little better
- Monsters (Victory cards) are a great way to change the game drastically every time. 
- The fact that you dont have to have a card just to trash a card you dont like is a positive (no need to wait for a "Chapel" card to pop up which brings less luck into the game.
- Leveling up characters is awesome and it feels like you are progressing constantly with new cards.
- No more needing to count Actions for which cards you can play (PLAY THEM ALL!)
- Many different Variants (solo/co-op/competitive) that the Designer recommends as well.

THINGS I LIKE BETTER IN DOMINION(compared to Thunderstone: Advance)*so far*:

- Games are faster paced and finish quicker
- Gateway game and easier to explain to people
- Extreme Combos (still unsure if Thunderstone can or will create combos of the 15+ cards in one hand. 
- Easier Setup and Takedown

Will update this score overtime

RATING: 9
A great fantasy deckbuilder.  Solo play is touch, but playing with friends has a lot of tactical play...hard to know just who is winning sometimes.

Made better with Epic Thunderstone variant though - truly like embarking on a fantasy adventure, as you use all the cards, not just a subset.  Since you do get lots, this does make sense for that reason too.

I'm not a big Deck Building fan.  Just competitively buying the same cards and hoping that they come up in the order you want isn't interesting to me.  Thunderstone Advance succeeds in injecting theme into the game genre.  It is fun building up your team of heroes and successively leveling them up to be better and more exciting, arming them with weapons and choosing to enter the dungeon and vanquish monsters.

The mechanics are still dull to me, but the execution is more engaging for me.  Unfortunately all of that is still not enough as Thunderstone tends to drag and overstay it's welcome.

Ez egy számomra pont megfelelő "nagy dobozos" kiadás, ami az eredeti (tehát nem advance) Thunderstone játék és kiegészítői válogatott lapjait adja ki újra, már az advance ikonográfiával és kissé átdolgozva az új rendszerhez. Pont illik a tavaly beszerzett Starter mellé, így már rengeteg a variáns.

Nagy pozitívum, hogy jár hozzá tábla (két oldalas!), XP tokenek, és a szabálykönyv is tartalmazza immár az epic variánst!

Although I quite like this game after 13 plays I'm getting pretty tired of it. It just feels overly long winded for what it is - games take too long to play and are not very interactive.

Very good deck-builder. I like the control it gives you over what you buy. I would be curious to try some of the house-rules out there for variety. The idea that enemies are like a "market" of victory points is good, and the "prepare" action is central to the mechanic (we overlooked it's importance the first 2 times we played). Slightly long set-up, but I've hardly scratched the surface of the replay value in this game.

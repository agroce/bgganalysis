What a great little game.  Games are short, but a lot of fun.  I still haven't worked out the best strategies, which makes me want to go back and play it more.  I have heard they are making expansions, which I hope is true!

RATING: 3
Not for me. Gameplay seemed to dependent on the luck of the draw for me. I understand that this is an inherent trait of such 1 on 1 card games but here it seemed way too eminent.
If you don't have a matching color card to top off a powerful card of your opponent, then you're screwed.

Also that mechanism of topping each other cards means that most of the time the cards you're playing and activating are one-trick-ponies. 

Games also seem to dragg on longer than they need to.

Component quality was alright. I liked the plastic gems.

RATING: 9
Excellent game to play with 2 players (4 players do not add any fun)

Overall good balance

- strategy - luck
- duration (between 10 min and 30 min)
- small enough to carry easily (for example on holidays)
- good balance during the game (you nearly never have the idea that you will win/lose during a game
- good replayability
- nice cards, gems (although I find the cards could be of better quality)
- Complexity - easy 

I played 50+ times and I still enjoy it very much. Certainly in my top 5 of 2-player games

Von Angesicht zu Angesicht: Harry-Potter-Zauberkraft-Anleihen-Battle, in der man sich in einer Auslage aus vier Zauberkarten-Typen gegenübersitzt und sich im Rahmen von zwei Siegbedingungen bekämpft: 1vs1, 1vs2, 2vs2. SPELLCASTER ist der klassische Spiele-Snack: zwischendurch schnell gespielt, weil flott von der Hand. Kein magischer Kracher, aber auch kein fauler Zauber.

The pacing of this game, and the wonderfully juicy decisions, make for an excellent time.  "Ooo, this card looks like it would be fun.  Ah, but this one plays into my overall strategy.  Dang, but I really need to play this one because I can't my let my opponent finish what they are setting up."  
All wrapped up in incredibly easy-to-grok rules.  Not a lot of timing questions or interaction problems.
I was astounded by how much I enjoyed it.

Rules aren't very clear, but you CAN recast the top spell from a stack you control. Games are pretty short. Solid two player for fantasy fans.

I expected more from Aaron Weissblum, but this is a disappointingly mediocre and generic game of dueling wizards with very simple rules. It's nice that there are two victory conditions: accumulating a number of magical sapphires or depleting the opponent's energy. Unfortunately, luck of the draw is huge, as cards vary wildly in power and the only way to neutralize them is to play a card of the same color.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice little head to head card game (you can play in teams, but it's essentially a 2 player game), where players compete over 4 different colors / places.

The twist is, that you have 2 actions per turn. Play a card and use a card. You can use any card that you played, aslong as your opponent didn't put a card on top of it. Having the mentioned 4 colors makes it somewhat interesting.

The balancing feels a bit off, but that's more like nitpicking than an actual problem. The production quality, graphics (the art itself is ok) and rules are really bad, but away from that, it's a very clever and neat (short) card game.

Fun and simple dueling game but not enough tokens sometimes which might be a consequence of just playing too defensively.

Decent 2 player filler that's simple to explain and plays quickly.

Not quite sure what to think of this one yet. I like it, but at the same time, it's a bit bland, swingy, and somehow, even though the art and components are thematic, the theme seems to disappear while playing. 

Not sure I'll keep this one.

12-01-2014 - This one came out of nowhere.  I'm not into these kind of card games, so when I went to the R&R booth at BGG I was only interested in a stamp, not a demo.  But the sales guy was a good sales guy and coerced me into trying it.  Darned if I didn't enjoy it!  What's more, I thought my wife would love it so I picked up a copy.  Subsequent plays did not disappoint.  This isn't a real meaty game, but for a quick-ish card game of back-and-forth battling, it's rather good.  I'm glad I bought it and look forward to more plays.  Solid 8.

Spellcaster is a quick and fun sorcery themed card fighting. It plays very well in teams and the sharing of resources makes the game interesting.

RATING: 7
Played this once at Essen. It is primarily a two player game that can be played with 3 or 4 in teams. Neat design, you play spells onto the pile of their colour, facing your way. The top card remains active until another card of that colour is played. Elegant & simple but seems quite tactical.

Duelling mages are certainly not the most original theme for a card game, but Spellcaster nevertheless brings something new to the table: short and concise rules that can be explained in under five minutes, excellent development (there are no obviously over- or underpowered cards) and great team play, both with three and with four players.

All in all, one of the rare small games that can be more than just a filler. Shame about the lurid cover, though, especially since the mechanics would have fit so well with a much more appealing wizard training theme. The actual Harry Potter license was probably too much to ask for ...

This is a surprising little game that caught my interest because it looks like it is light and fast enough that Tatham could grasp this one. Very short with nice artwork and bits. I am now convinced after watching Tom Vasel's review that the simplicity of this game would work well for Tatham.

Good, quick, light 2-player card dueling game that my daughter (7) enjoys and is still interesting for me.  I think this will get some play time.

While the design is solid for what it is, it feels like a missed opportunity on some of the creative choices.  Theme (and name of the game for that matter) couldn't be more generic - and while the art is generally good (comically breasted female wizard on the cover notwithstanding) with unique art for each of the cards, the graphic design isn't great.

Amazing Gateway game! 
Pros:
It is very fun and light. Completely different from Magic: the Gathering, but with a similar feel.  
Cons:
Yellow cards are a little underwhelming
I believe there is a dominant strategy
Mixed Pro/Con:
Can be very luck based, which levels the playing grounds for new players, but will frustrate very experienced gamers.

1 play, 2er

A small form factor, very interesting 2 (or 3-4 with teams) player battle card game sort of like BattleLine but with cool card effects reminiscent of Magic. The rules are simple, though the rule book is a bit _too_ brief -- take a look at the Rules Forum here! Still, well worth playing if you're looking for a fairly quick CCG-feel game without the hassle of CCGs or LCGs. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup
- Place the 4 colored tiles in a row between players
- Shuffle the deck of cards (all unique, in one of four colors) and deal each player 3 cards (if 3er, one gets 6 and plays against the other two)
- Give each player a number of blue Sapphires and yellow Energy counters (depending on player count)

Your Turn: In order, ...
- Activate any enchantments visible in the center row, that are facing you
- Draw a card
- Take 2 actions:
... draw card
... play a card to its matching tile, on top of any card already there, facing you
... activate any card facing you in the display, except may not use this action on the same card twice

Winning the Game
- Knock the other player down to 0 Energy
OR
- Collect 15* Sapphires

RATING: 5
Very light card game and good entry level game. Had a situation where I had to play games with several people who aren't familiar with board gaming, for several hours. Brought some staple light/portable games, like Love Letter and Sushi Go, but none had particularly strong 2 player games, so Spellcaster came out pretty often throughout this event. On average, I was able to get games going after about 3 minutes, after setting up components and explaining the rules. They all enjoyed it, except for this one kid who felt that I was going easy on him. (I was going easy on everyone, but made sure to adjust the difficulty so that they barely win, unless they fail to see game winning moves for several consecutive turns, at which point it would be very obvious that I'm going easy on them; basically we were handing out prizes to winners so it was more ideal for us to let them win.) A lot of people even asked where they could get the game, and I recommended they buy from Amazon or CoolStuff and referred them to this site (BGG), since a few even asked about where to find out about other games.

Besides that, most of the gameplay revolves around the deck of cards provided in the set, and each card is unique, making things like card counting pretty worthless. Not much there in the way of predictability, since a really lucky draw can instantly win someone the game. Not really a game that you play for the game. It's more like an activity to do while talking with a friend or something.

What a super fun two-player game! And every card is unique! The simplicity is what really sells it for me, though. I haven't played Magic in years, but this one will be a definite keeper.

This game wasn't on my radar, but friends got a copy and it's co-designed by [person=235][/person], who has been involved in some solid titles in the past.
The rules are simple: draw a card and perform 2 actions. Actions can be to play a card, activate a played card or draw a card. The aim is to get to a number of points or to drain the 'life' of the other team. Pretty simple. The one game we played had my team off to a good start, and that never changed. I guess we had a lot of luck and used our cards well, but this is not a game that excites me. Having it be closer would only make it longer, which wouldn't be positive.

Initial rating: 5.5/10

Not terrible, not great.

On the plus side, drawing into nearly-broken cards guarantees a short game - particularly if your opponent can't cover them up.  Some cards are so nasty that the only thing missing is the x-rated art.

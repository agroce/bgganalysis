GAME: The Really Nasty Horse Racing Game

So Nasty that it made my sister-in-law burst into tears one time.  Everyone else enjoyed it though....until then.

RATING: 6
Played a couple of times many years ago and really enjoyed it esp the horse racing gambling theme. But that was pre-geek and I'd now really like to try Winner's Circle which being by the man is probably better.

Need to research some more, but it sounds really fun.

RATING: 8
Players run their horses in each race, while betting loads of cash on the horse they think will win. Players get cards that can screw other people up. Lots of luck, but lots of fun if you get into it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I know it's not a deep game, but it is a lot of fun.  I'd MUCH prefer to play this than Wits and Wagers...there's a lot more to it and a better theme.  It's almost a party game, but maybe not quite - I could also see it as a "lads' night in with the beers game" or a family game.  The random element is totally apt here and so though it may be painful when someone nobbles your horse, it is only to be expected.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was a fun light game with very little strategy and a whole lotta luck.  The shifts in fortune are dramatic!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Best played with 4+ people (not enough action with 2 or 3 people).  Not an overly complex game so definitely better for a non-gaming group.  The goal is pretty much to win while screwing other people over.  The game can be a little boring when everyone has played their action card for the race - if all cards are played early then it's just a matter of rolling the dice to see how you finish.  The betting part is definitely fun, but overall the game doesn't have great balance.  30-45 minute game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Every so often I play a racing game and re-realize that I really don't like racing games.If you like racing and screwage games, this'll be right up your alley; I'm not big on either.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I would even rate it a 9 (on sheer enjoyment), except that there is a lot of luck and it does have a long playing time. In fact, too long a playing time for the amount of luck, so it seldom sees the table.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Too much of a dice fest with the in-box rules.  The group I play with much prefers our own ultra nasty version of the rules where sometimes no horses finish the race (7/10 for our rules)!!!!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Twin objectives of placing your horse in the top three and engineering a win for the nag you backed keep interest and fun levels high. Very popular with non-gamers, but a bit long. Deal as many Really Nasty cards as possible for the number of players.

RATING: 5.5
Perfectly decent game for light-hearted fun thanks to the simple twist of allowing you to make money two ways (which may or may not be mutually exclusive) - by getting prize money when your horses win races, or by betting on rival horses and making money from your wagers. Some of the best races have been when you're desperately struggling to lose because you've bet on a rival. Though you don't want to make it too obvious that you want to lose because it's always good if a rival expends their limited chance cards getting your horse to fall if that's the result you want anyway.
The prize giving at the end of races is neat if someone who you think has done badly because their horse fell at the first turns out to be delighted because they bet on the winner.
Not too much here to tax the brain cells, but this large element of bluff is good for a laugh.

This is a jewel. I love games that involve screwage as a forced part of the mechanics (since no reasonable person can take offence at them) and this plays well to that guilty pleasure. The screwage is not optional, and that makes it much easier to take.

RATING: 6.5
The mix of being able to bet on someone else, use dice and cards and possibly throw the race make this one an interesting mix where luck does come into it but is nicely balanced by shrewed play.

Not too heavy. Goes nicely with a beer.

RATING: 6.5
If you're looking for a strategy game, this is not it.  But if you're with a group of people who don't take anything personally and approach it with a fun attitude, it's a lot of fun.  The distribution of the cards is a bit random (as is the dice roll as well).  I really like the effect of other people betting on other's horses.  This, and the cards, make this a unique horse racing game.

A great game to play with family.  It's low on strategy, but some of the games have produced moments with such funny twists and turns that they have been brought up and laughed about even many years later.

RATING: 6
This is a fun horse racing game, but I don't know if I would call it "really nasty".  I suppose "Slightly Nasty Horse Racing Game" wouldn't have marketed well though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: OK, maybe my initial play was "hilarious", but after playing it a few more times I think "mildly amusing" is a better descriptor.  It often boils down to an "all or nothing" bet for many of the players for the last race - which feels a bit disappointing after spending an hour or more going through the earlier races.  Dropping my rating down. (8/1/2008)

Played three times. Okay but rather random game. Very limited opportunities to be 'really nasty' in the time it takes to complete six races. In my last game I had to use all three of my cards to achieve the result I wanted for the big-prize race which meant five races were purely based on my dice rolls (for me anyway). :(

It's not really an "7" game, really maybe a "6," but it was really fun with six people playing, so the fun factor bolstered the score here.

RATING: 7
Yeah, there's a lot of luck.  For example, the impact of the cards is very variable....and you could end up with a killer hand or with cards that never really seem relevant.

I like that you can win by making good bets, even if your horse doesn't win. Trying to form those secret little alliances for a race....where you are actually using your own horse to run interference rather than try to win, that makes the races really fun. 

I'd be happy to play this one most of the time...but only under the right conditions (5 or 6 players that don't take it very seriously)

A great example of a variation on racing games. You race against your opponents and can be quite evil to them by making them fall or swerve on the run in. Involves some skill.

This game is not really very nasty at all.

The game is very random. This is not necessarily a bad thing and may ever replicate reality.

The game is great as a light-hearted social acitivity. It does not have a great deal of strategy due to the significance played by the dice.

Purchased November 2007.

RATING: 6
Quite fun, though very luck based.

This game is about horse racing, and so unsurprisingly it involves a LOT of luck. However the 'really nasty' cards each player gets make the game much more enjoyable.

To me, this is how an entirely luck based game should be.

It's not really all that nasty, but it sure is quite a bit of fun with a full field.  I like the concept behind the game, but can't help think that more could have been done with this game.  Perhaps this is because it was aimed at the mainstream rather than hobby demographic.

RATING: 6
While this game is fun and competitive, the overall play time is far too long. The cards you can play to alter the course of the races are fun, but feel a little limited. Overall player interaction is limited and might have been a better game if there was more opportunity for this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fantastic bits and a really fun (although occasionally frustrating) mechanism are big plusses.  The downside is that the winner is often the player who bets everything on the last race and wins, which negates all the good work done up until then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Scores poorly on "innovative mechanisms" but quite well on "fun value for hosing my buddies". One of the better race games out there, frankly. All about the betting. We are considering adding a house rule to remove the 'lane 6' card unless playing with six players.

Hilarious back-stabbing fun. Recommended, light hearted fun.

RATING: 10
Fabulous, devious, dirty, nasty, fun. Watching someones face drop in amazement when you put your own horse onto a fence on purpose and goes out, and they bet a bundle on it winning is pure beauty at its devious best. Definitely a game for the boys with a few beers, but works just as well with the family and that dad who always bought boardgames when you were a kid that were so complicated you never stood a chance of winning. Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great fun game when we don't want to have to think too hard.
It is a real 'screwage' game, and it is fun to throw a race, and watch the weeping of the players who bet on you.... but of course it goes the other way as well!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Chaotic and luck-based, but still loads of fun!  I really enjoy playing this game.  My only knock against it is that it can drag on a little long with 6 players - especially for those players who are way behind in the money count.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Surprisingly fun party game.  Not the deepest and at it's heart it's roll & move, but it's got some fun tweaks, because the richest punter wins rather than those with the fastest horses and most wins.  It's run over a series of 5 races and players can bet for their own horse or against it!  There are some take-that cards and horse advantages, so it does make the races tight and ultimately the game, as players have the same quality horses, but may choose to enter a weaker horse if they suspect their opponents will start stronger or faster ones.  If your horse wins, you also win prize stakes money and there's the hidden gambling and card play which just make this a tense, but quick series of races to the finish. There's sabotage, false starts, riderless horses and some other chicanery.  Probably outstays it's welcome after 5 races, but there just aren't enough good horse racing games out there (maybe the Horgers and GMT will adapt Thunder Alley), so this is a good one to scout out if you don't mind a dose of some mildish take that.

A fun game for an evening in with a group of non-gamer friends. Probably wouldn't want to pull it out of the box more than once or twice a year, but a pleasant and sociable way to spend an evening with plenty of opportunity to 'stick the knife in' to your co-players.

RATING: 6
[1 play] A friend was getting rid of his copy of this, and I played it to see if I wanted to take it off his hands.  I have Winner's Circle and Jockey, but am still open to another horseracing game if it has something to offer.  This did, but not enough. 
The really nasty part--the smiting cards--is good, but you can't do much to someone if they're too careful to land on a fence, and you don't get that many smiting cards to last you for the whole game.  Beyond that and a bit of blocking (OK, a LOT of blocking!) on the track, it's roll-and-move.  I didn't like this as much as Jockey, where you are playing cards to move horses and have much more strategic influence.

Charity store find. :)

I have played this game only the once. The other players, despite numerous warnings, used both cards early in the first race in a fantastic  show of one-up-manship and bet all of their money (and lost it). This skewed that game a bit and victory felt very hollow.

I would like to play this again.

Have not the 1987 but the 21st anniversary edition.  Shame they didn't celebrate by sorting out the rules - wrong size for the box, green text, lack of clarity about moving.   A diagram would really help.

Not a bad game. It has some interesting and mischevious cards to play on others. The game is very cut-throat and fun, but takes a very long time to play if you follow the rules and play the way they say to. Though you could shorten the game a bit by not playing as many races as normal.

I was expecting more from this game. It just fell kind of short for me. Maybe things will change after more plays.

RATING: 8
OK, so strategy is not the name of the game on this British import, but nevertheless I find it to be a lot of fun when I want a lighthearted, fun, not-much-thinking-required type of game.  The only downfall is that I have not had nearly as much fun with my own copy as I do at Winter War, one of the gaming conventions I attend every year.  If the judge (Tim Gritten) came with the game, then it would be a hoot!  This game is definitely one of the major highlights of the con every year, but like I said, it's better just left at the con.

This game is aptly named. Don't take it too seriously, as the event cards can (and will) throw everything out of whack. Never discount a horse just because it's got 50:1 odds. Anything can happen in this game. Plays pretty quickly too. Total beer-n-pretzels game.

Wonderful fun so long as everyone really is nasty! (Sorry, please & thank-you just don't work.)  We deal out more event cards than the rules suggest to ensure it is even nastier.  A good tick-tack man to do the tote board adds extra flavour! (Although the most important flavour is lots of Beer!

RATING: 7
Not terribly difficult.  The dice pretty much mean that you can make your plans, but plan on not making it.  

I like the "odds" table, but feel that it skews the game to betting rather than playing your own horse.  The setup also has a little bluffing involved.  It can be a hoot to play this with the correct "beer and pretzel" crowd.  It is best to enjoy the game and not worry about the win.  

That being said, there are a few problems with the game besides the skewing of the odds.  1) Setup can be very important, but new players may miss the importance.  2) Race order can greatly push play to rely on one key race, or give a more even play.  That is not always an easy read.  3) If you don't win a little money early in the game, you can be absolutley trounced.  You need to put betting money down, and you need to get at least 1 long shot to have any hope to win.  4) Due to all this, play is pretty much random.  Kind of like the race track....

RATING: 2
Bleh!  We had a couple fun moments in the game, but most of it was quite boring.  We even adapted the cards a bit to allow them to be played more freely to harass people or the game would have been even more boring - pretty much straight roll and move.  I'm not sure that people tried hard enough to bet on other people's horses and move one's own horse more to the outside to slow it down and allow someone else to win.  I'd just rather play Winner's Circle by a large margin.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Mildly amusing light game with a horseracing theme.  Very luck driven in terms of die rolls, lane seedings and cards drawn.  The betting portion of each race is interesting as one must figure out who is running their race to win and who is likely to scuttle their own chances.  The problem is that is the shortest portion while the ruunning of the races themselves is less interesting and occupies the majority of the time of the game.

A game that really does live up to its name, this will test the best of friendships as almost every rule is designed to aggravate and annoy all the players presents. This however does not make a bad game, when all is said and done the victories are all the sweeter.

Best racing game ever!  Better than Formula De (which I bought based on recommendations from the geek and have regretted ever since).  Make sure to play with the correct rules!  It took us three playings to get the rules right.

RATING: 7
This is on of the most requested game for people who play with us a lot -- probably because it was one the first in our collection that everyone hadn't already heard of. My rating has dropped due to the length of the game, though we still have lots of fun when it hits the table.

I find this game plays really quickly contrary to some of the session reports / reviews on here.  Much faster than Win, Place or Show!!  Lots of luck due to the special cards... The game needs five or six players to shine.  Three players leaves the track too bare.

RATING: 6
Got this in good condition for Â£1.85 from a charity shop! It's the version with the old-school plastic horses like the ones you get in the old arcade penny gambling machines!

Simple once you get the hang of it, although it can take longer to play then you may want a game of this weight to go on for. Heavily luck driven with only a few subtle strategies makes this not a game for serious gamers. But from the point of view of a gambling game this is light, fun, and very good.

The best racing game that I have come across, and the title really says it all, for there are plenty of dirty tricks in this one.  The odds matrix for the betting is simple and inspired.  I would have preferred a game which played out a little bit more quickly though.

Complete dice-fest, and huge luck in the betting, but good theme and the fun arrives with the revelations ... whoâ€™s racing to win, whoâ€™s not, the close finishes, and the post-race celebrations, both faked (to get objections going) and real. But will fall flat if you're not hamming it up.

Interesting Race and bet game, bit too light for me. Also longer than a filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is the sort of game I would have played to death when I was a kid, and it still has that fun factor hold on me that makes me keen to play it as an adult.  Some might complain that it is too easy for someone to win through taking a large gamble on the last race, but providing all the bets, including their size, are kept secret (counter to the rules), this aspect actually adds to the excitement as no-one should feel they are ever too far behind to catch up.  If only the real bookies set odds as generous as these!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a once a year stable, oops staple game (and as such I forget) that pays out for your horse's placing and your secret bid for first for each of 6 races. The design is from the late '80s and has the old attitude of plenty of die rolling and long rounds of play in which you are a spectator are "fun". It's not too bad when races are played quickly and your secret bid is still in the running, but if I want a horse race I wouldn't pick this nasty "mare", as I can easily find more engaging, streamlined and shortlived fun in Royal Turf.

Great fun--a sneaky horse race where you can secretly choose to bet on your opponents!  But needs lots of house rules to shine--for example we always order the prize money from smallest to largest (or prize money is meaningless), and let hedge cards work 1 out 6 times on space before the hedge.

A great fun horse-racing game with a clever twist. Never as nasty as the title suggests but still fun. You need to keep up the pace otherwise the 6 races can take a long time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Although the betting/earning mechanic is quite well developed, the wreck-your-opponent (Really Nasty) cards are limited in scope, and the single-die-based movement mechanic can be absolutely frustrating. Try the manual's recommended "six players, six races", and you'll see that the fun can wear out quickly. I'd have conceded and quit early, if I didn't feel I'd spoil other people's fun.

One of the best horse racing games there is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game shows its age, and its debt to Totopoly. Players play six races, which are basically resolved by dice roll. In the races they bet on which horse will win and also claim prize money for the results. Players have limited cards which will affect the race.
The idea is clever but there isn't enough nastiness and the whole thing is too long, too dull, and too random.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Great for cheating, lying and cursing with/at your friends.  Much hilarity as your horse falls at the last and faces round the board either rise or fall depending on who they were betting on!

Good for a laugh with six players. Not much more there than a once a year laugh. The best thing here is the final race where those not in the running bet their entire stake and those with lots of cash try to work out how much of it they need to gamble. It's just fun every once in a while.

Great party horse racing game. Plays over the course of 6 races. Each player enters one of their horses in each race and can either bet on this or other players horses.

Also gives you the chance to either improve or nobble the chances of your horse (or others) as well.

Only thing stopping this being rated higher is that the outcome also tends to be too reliant on the final race. Where everyone seems to hold back and bet all their money on this race.

Simple elegant game, that is just a ton of fun.  This game is great in that the amount that you can screw other players over is limited enough not to be too out of control, and diverse enough to keep you guessing.  This is one of the few games where even though you might be eliminated for a little while there is still reason for you to be involved in the game.  Cool movement, multiple ways to victory, and just downright beautiful board and bits.

this should be rethemed to include organized crime; the game really isn't about horse racing, it's about race fixing. betting on another's horse and throwing the race is a typical strategy. good with enthusiastic opponent screwers.

RATING: 7.5
A truly entertaining horse racing game. Skullduggery is at the heart of it, and you may find yourself trying to make your own horse lose in some races. The family always has a good time, and much laughter ensues.

The only downsides are that it's a bit long, and the rules for the dirty tricks always seem to require a look-up.

This is best played with more players than we usually have.  And plenty of alcohol is good too.

It should really be renamed the only moderately nasty horse racing game.

There are not enough cards (some of which are very situational) and/or too many races for this to be nasty enough.

The number of D6 rolls it takes to get around means that this really is nothing more than a complete crapshoot.

It's honestly a bit meh.

Revised rating: I played this a few times in the mid-1990s, and found it interesting. How times have changed. A decade later, this just doesn't hold up well. Bits are still cool, but the randomness is just overwhelming in comparison to some of the polished game designs that have arrived on the scene in the time since I first played this and my most recent play. That's good for gaming, but I'm guessing this game simply doesn't make it back to table at my place ...

Sometimes is nice just to sit back and play a bit of roll'n move. The betting aspects dont involve too mcuh finesse (Knizia fans should stick with Winner's Circle)but the race itself is well done with the all important inside edge being hard to hang onto without risking comeuppance on a fence

You secretly bet on one of the players to win a race. But, that player may have bet on someone else to win and may then try to make their horse loose that race. But, dirty tricks can be used to help try and sstop or help particuler horses win or loose.

Not my cup of tea.  I don't mind random and chaotic, luck based games.  I'd just rather not play them for two hours.

There's very little strategy here.  You've got some control over what happens to your horse, but not much.  What lane you start in is random.  How fast you go is entirely based on dice rolls, and there is no telling who the other players have bet on, so you have no idea when your horse is going to fall over and die.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rather an odd game, where you both race using the die, bet on either yourself or your opponents winning, and can also win prize money. Oh, and play nasty cards to make sure certain people don't win. I like it. :o)

I heavily researched this game before purchase and wanted the best for my money. Firstly the actual plastic horse models over the thin plastic, coloured bases models attracted me to the vintage 1980's version.  Secondly this and the 21st Anniversary edition and other later editions had the separate 'bookies board'.  Didn't like the idea of the bookies board being a part of the gameboard and having a crease right through it.  I prefer the artwork on the race cards from later versions over the ones included in my owned version but a small price to pay.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although a roll and move; the opposition will either block in horses they do not want to win, or send other fast horses around the outside lanes. In effect you're helping/pushing the horse you bet on forwards.

There's also nothing like speeding ahead when everyone is rooting for your horse, only to make it purposely fall at the finish line :devil:

I do wish the calculation of earnings was a little easier though. I'm no genius with mathematics, and working out a 33:1 wager at seven Million, eight hundred and five thousand often baffles me...

Upgraded to the newer Upstarts square box edition with the flat style cut-out horses. These are junk compared to the originals, and do not even grip in the bases. I had to super-glue them in to stop them sliding out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The flat pieces do not hold well in the bases. Ended up glueing them in place.

:thumbsup: There is typically a good deal of variability in the cards available for purchase with each play.
:thumbsup: The component quality is quite good across the board with a beautiful artistic style.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]There are very few options to mitigate bad dice rolls, despite dice being the central mechanic.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The small dice are somewhat awkward and can feel odd to handle so often on every turn.

:thumbsdown: The theme is disconnected from the mechanics in many ways, which clearly reduces the enjoyment.
:thumbsdown: The number of decisions and strategies is rather limited for the amount of available choices.

Nice work placement, beautiful art. I enjoyed the fact that the position of the card affects the final scoring, it seems to have a nice amount of variability, but haven't played enough to make such affirmation. I felt it had a little bit of min-maxing (as many other games do), but I was ok with it. I had read this game was AP prone (as well as the solutions)and it could cause downtime problems, but this (AP) isn't an issue here in our house so it went on smoothly, My younger son felt it was a bit simple and somewhat boring, but this can be attributed to the box that evokes an Indiana Jones like adventure game, and that is not the case.

My first, and to this point only, disappointment from Ryan Laukat. I think it is a fine game, but it ended up feeling surprising dry to me, despite a theme that I would naturally enjoy. I have only played it with two players though, so I would be willing to give it another shot with more to see if it improves things.

Artifacts, Inc. is a small, well designed dice placement game from designer, artist and publisher Ryan Lauket. Ryan has designed a small game with a big feel as you travel the world in what we assume to be a 1930-1940s era archaeological adventure to gain prestige and recognition. You do so by placing dice to gather income to be able to buy locations, research archaeological sites, put rare artifacts on display in museums or go diving beneath the sea to bring up long lost treasures..  The game is simple. The art is very good , as with all of Ryan's graphic designs. The components are top notch. This tiny little Euro touches on what makes classic Euros so fun ,ease of game play with an emphasis on strategy. It only gets an 8 because the mechanisms don't tie into the theme as well as they could. Perhaps an expansion could change this to bring the rating up higher?

Dice placement, market and reputation scoring with a slightly vague but unique archaeological theme which approaches that whole pulp Indiana Jones aesthetic from a different angle than many of those other, action-oriented games that also use it.

Ryan Laukat hits yet another home run with this little gem.  "Elegant" would be the word that describes this game, but not in an aesthetic way.  The art is beautiful and serene, but the gameplay hits that spot that makes you want to try it again, right away. I liked it so much that I thought it should have been a much longer game IMHO, but it's just right the way it is. Sort of like licking your fingers after devouring an order of hot McDonald's french fries, you just want more.

I've only played a couple 2-player sessions, but I really like Artifacts Inc. so far.  I do wonder if downtime might be an issue with 3--4 players.  The game is deceptively simple--even though there's a ton of stuff on the table, all of the actions are fast and easy to execute thanks to mostly stellar iconography.  It's [i]kind of[/i] a worker placement game, but without the blocking mechanic usually present in that genre.  And it's [i]barely[/i] a dice game--more of an action point allowance game.  The dice do sometimes matter, but they're hardly restrictive and you can usually do everything you want to do on your turn.  The dice mostly just kind of guide you in a direction.  For example, there's one card that you can utilize with anything but a die with a value of 2.  There are multiple paths to victory, having more dice than your opponents doesn't remotely guarantee a win, and... sheesh, did I mention how great the art is?  Because it's great.

I may be projecting, but I saw some mechanics in the game that were pleasantly evocative of other games I've played.  The majority mechanic of the museums feels a lot like Ticket to Ride's push-your-luck set collection--do you cash in the artifacts now, or wait until you have more?  Without a plan, your opponents could easily swoop in and take all of the good options.  Also, the adjacency mechanic in players' tableaus was very reminiscent of XCOM's home base setup, where you get stat bonuses for having similar rooms next to each other.  I'm not sure if these games actually inspired some part of Artifacts, Inc., though, or if it's just a coincidence.  I get warm feelies from assuming that they did. 

Some minor quibbles:

• All of the money tokens have the same shape, size, design, and color--the only difference is the number.  I often play with a pal who is legally blind, so that's a small shame for what is otherwise a game with no hidden information and easily recognizable actions.

• Each player has only 12 cubes to represent artifacts.  The rules say that nothing is finite, so if you run out of these cubes, you have to get some other tokens from another game to supplement (including the aforementioned money tokens, although those were always abundant).  Even in just a 2-player game, we ran out of our own cubes pretty quickly and had to use the 3rd and 4th player pieces as our own.  That's just a personal pet peeve of mine and something I can get over, but I always prefer to have everything I need to play in the box--in a 4-player game, this would have been a big bummer.

• The rules are VERY clear, but at first glance, the cards with multiple dice on them [i]really[/i] look like they require all the dice pictured on the card.  This is not the case--each action in the game only requires a single die.  If you have a card with multiple dice on it, it simply means you can execute it more than once.  More of an observation, really.  

Overall, very pleasant game with great art and easy-to-understand rules.  This is my first Laukat game, but it definitely won't be my last. Acquired via Kickstarter.

This game includes great artwork and one of my favorite game play features- multiple paths to victory. The bevy of choices you have each turn is mitigated somewhat by the roll of the dice but players must still pick and choose which things to pursue instead of trying to do everything. The artwork and gameplay wonderfully support the theme in an excellent game all abut making careful choices.

Another dice (worker) placement game where the theme is that you are trying to run the best archeology company. Most of the mechanics we've seen before, but with the Ryan Laukat charm. Although it requires a brief look on the Geek to clarify some rules, once that obstacle is overcome the game is a treat for families or new gamers.

Decent game that I want to like more than I do (because the artwork is fantastic).  Downtime with 4 is too much and drags out the game.  2-3 is better but given the somewhat limited strategic options, it'd be nice if it played faster.  Supplying your own extra set of dice helps.

Played through a two-player game solo to learn the game.  The museum points seem to really swing the results a lot, you can't ignore majority in the museums.  They may swing things too much.  Also suspect there will be a lot of downtime as players figure out how to spend their dice.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
An interesting take on a dice worker system, but I think the additional layer this has, say over Machi Koro, causes too much down time.  Because of this, this really is a straight 2p game IMHO.  

The art in this one is fantastic, and the production quality is solid, except for the board being paper.  I think this game needs more cards to keep it interesting, and I don't think the game is good enough to warrant the expansions it needs long term.  I feel like this one will be forgotten in a year...

Nothing unique or original here, but a decent game nonetheless: it takes a lot of ideas from Laukats's other games (Ancient World, City of Iron) and adds a dice placement mechanic. One difference is that you don't block each other in this game—each player takes their whole turn and then takes their dice back—which makes this very much more of a multiplayer solitaire game. 

I'm still not convinced that each path is equal in terms of points: diving alone seems like an unlikely route to victory, because it seems much harder to do than digging, but I'd have to play more to see. My biggest complaint: really crappy, cheap dice.

A decent,  simple game of rolling dice and using the results to activate various cards you'e acquired. Much of the game involves using dice to generate artifacts, which you can then turn into money and points.

There are a handful of different strategies to go after, and luck will certainly play some role as to whether or not you can carry it out successfully, as they are dice after all, and you don't always get what you need.

A good game to pull out with family that is still interesting enough for a gamer.

This game hasn't gotten a lot of love from reviewers.  Probably because Ryan Laukat's games are typically more epic, longer games.  This game is a quick 30 minute filler game.  The set up is a little obnoxious as the cards look very similar to each other, and you need to double check that they're flipped to the correct side, but I still think it plays okay.  Not a favorite game, but also not a bad game.  Game could have come with a few more dice.

Classic problem of writing a rule book without passing it by non gamers.

That the diving cards give a plus to the die isn’t exactly clear. There are others cards. They couldn’t have supply a description of what these cards do? Look at the rules  forum, for a simple game lots of questions.

It’s not a complex or hard game to learn, but these faults in the rule book would keep it from every being main stream.

*Playing with the designer's cutthroat variant is a MUST* A neatly themed dice-rolling worker placement game. A lot of components for a relatively light game, but it packs together well. Potential imbalance with a couple of cards but overall neat as a filler game. The boyfriend and I enjoy bringing this to the table for a quick 45-minute play on dull nights.

As always with a Laukat game, art and component quality are top-notch. Although this game is rooted in reality and lacks a bit of the whimsy and character of his other games, it's still quite good-looking.

Dice Driven
2-4 players compete to grow the most famous archaeology company. Players roll dice, which represent their troop of adventurers, and place them on cards in order to find artifacts, sell them to museums, and purchase new cards representing their company assets. Players can choose to focus on making lots of money by selling artifacts, having museum majorities, creating the best combination of expeditions and buildings, or searching below the waves for lost cities and hidden treasures. The first player to reach 20 reputation triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most total reputation wins!

A light worker placement game. There is a bit of luck, a bit of decision making and a bit of randomness involved. The game is fast but more players increase playing time and intervals till a player's next turn are augmented as well. There is little interaction and sometimes the game play gets sluggish. This can be fixed with the 'Cutthroat Deals' variant. The cards have nice graphics and one needs table space when they are spread out. The rules are easy to learn and after one play you will probably don't need the rulebook any more. The concept is interesting and you can have a fun time.

I found this one when looking for engine-building games. I like the theme. Mechanically it reminds me of a simpler Spyrium.
It's just not as exciting or enticing as some of the other engine builders I've discovered.

This game turned out to be exactly what I was hoping it would be, with one exception - The dice just don't seem to have much impact and never felt like it restricted decision making. Earlier on with fewer dice there are times where I don't have a result that I want, but usually there's another option that is equally as good. But that said, I am happy with that because it isn't a game that is swung by favorable or unfavorable dice rolls but rather by your decisions. There seems to be a few "Must do early on" moves like upgrading for a fourth dice followed quickly by a fifth as more dice means more actions and a greater chance to do what you want. It fits the game weight that I like so it'll be on my shelf for years to come.

Artifacts Inc was a fun little game initially, but after a few plays many things started to irk me. I was really turned off by the downtime between turns. I know that the designer offered up a variant on the forums here to fix this issue, but it made me wonder why the game wasn't like that to begin with. Also, I felt the game lasted too long for how much fun it provided.

Overall, I'd play it again if someone really wanted to, but I won't suggest it.

Light dice placement game with some nice mechanisms. Art is beautiful, but other components (e.g. dice) were lackluster. Major complaint is that the first few turns of the game are devoted to acquiring more dice (you will be behind if you don't). I'd prefer a Lords of Waterdeep-type mechanism where the players are given more workers (dice) as the game progresses.

Good descent dice worker placement..... and love the idea of the fact it's more a race as a "who build the best points gathering machine"... 

Likely the rating will move to 8 when we play next time the simultanious dice variant..... 
Played with 3... and yes.. with 4 the AP will take too long.
With 3 this was just acceptable.

Artifacts, Inc. is a Ryan Laukat game with an archaeology theme, so you know it is going to look good and be creative. It is a small card-management and variable power game with dice that you use as workers; like a small scale game of Alien Frontiers or Troyes. It is on the light side, but is a great strategy filler.

Really enjoyed the theme of this game. Love the idea of collecting things, and museums. So many things to like here. There are a couple things I would change. I found it odd the designer chose to only use cards, when a board would of made things a lot cleaner and nicer. The rulebook wasn't as clear on some things....and for a dice game, it should of came with at least another set of dice. Things just got fiddly after a while...but overall I very much enjoyed this.

This hits the same initial pleasure center as Machi Koro, but without hitting the same half-life of boredom & randomness.

It sustains interest & player engagement through satisfying, deeper gameplay, with a cocktail of mechanics we've seen in other Laukat designs and are put to good use here as well. The theme of growing expedition projects is loosely tied to a Kingsburg-like concept of dice (worker) allocation, selling produced goods (found artifacts) for money, a majority-driven VP bonus system which feels similar to Ryan's older game City of Iron, and a mechanic of building out a village/tableau where card adjacencies matter and cards are upgradeable. All in a polished, seemingly effortless design. The beautiful art just adds to the pleasure of playing this game, as is the case with all of Ryan's work.

This has that same soft explosion of gameplay in a small package that I first got out of Eight Minute Empire Legends.

The concept of the game seemed interesting to me, dice worker placement but lighter than say Stone Age.

The theme of the game made sense and the art is awesome as always. However the gameplay felt a bit flat, it's a very light game so I think you couldn't really build an engine or combos. Once you start getting some special buildings going, the game is over

I also felt the extra dice were powerful, something that usually happens in worker placement games but because there is a limited amount, it sucks for the other players. There isn't a major trade off for going for dice first. And the spatial element of the buildings in this game feel out of place, totally was not needed

At least the game isn't that long and the art is nice to look at. The gameplay isn't bad but won't be keeping this one around

Another good Ryan Laukat game. This one falls somewhere in between his "8 minute" games and his big box games in terms of complexity. I suspect this may become one of my most played of his games due to that and the theme, which is one I like.

RATING: 5
It's definitely recognizable as a Laukat game.  It has similar art to the other games (a good thing) but for me, gives me the same semi-finished feeling of his other games.  In this one, there's just too much unnecessary choice.  The best comparison I can make is that it's a longer Machi Koro - damning praise, unfortunately.

Tons of good gameplay ideas but the execution could have been refined more. For one thing, I feel the start of the game is a bit slow and that the end game comes too abruptly (you can score almost half the points you need to end the game in one turn near the end).

The rules as-is lead to a bit of AP as you plan your whole turn after rolling your dice. I have yet to play the Cutthroat Variant from the designer to see if the game moves along more quickly.

Theme wise it works very well, and the art really draws you in, like all of Laukat's games.

A good filler game but not a favorite based on the reasons stated above.

Great full game feel for a micro-sized game that plays very quickly and has a lot of fun for that little box!

Would have been nice for a dollar or two more to have 4 sets of colored dice for the game.  Also, it would have been really nice to see some sort of art progressing as the dive gets deeper.  Great mechanic though!

The components are pretty good(especially for the price)and the artwork is nice, which is expected from this designer.

The theme has character and  really makes sense.  I really enjoyed that this time.

Van egy-két lap amivel lehet módosítani a kis dobásokat, de ezt is csak kis mértékben. Aki pedig 5-6-os dobásokat produkál, az olyan előnyt kap, amit semmiféle módosítással sem tudsz behozni.

RATING: 5
Should play faster for its weight. Don't get me wrong, there's a fair number of decisions to make each turn - but none of them have much consequence, and when you've suddenly got 6 dice to assign, the game starts to bog down on small decisions that don't mean that much in the grand scheme. 

It's possible, if you roll the right combination, to set off a fantastic turn where you discover, sell, buy, and upgrade in rapid succession - which is quite satisfying. The problem is, it's an engine builder, but you don't know if your engine is going to run that turn, because it's all up to the luck of the roll. You can have a great system in place, but if the dice don't co-operate, you're going to spend even more time figuring out how to make the best of a bad turn - which happens so often that it, unfortunately, mars the experience for me. 

I was really excited to play this, and bought it as soon as it was available. The theme is fantastic, but the core mechanics could use some tweaking. It ends up being a game full of math and min-maxing your dice placement which - while fine in other deeper games - doesn't fit well with the dearth of choices to make here; or with how long I perceive the game should be at least. I think there's the basis of a great game here, that could have definitely benefitted from the talents of a game developer to shave down the rough edges and find some better solutions to the game's issues. As it is, it now feels kind of half-baked and incomplete.

Artifacts Inc. is a mixed bag.  The dice are too tiny, the art is wonderful, and the cubes are in short supply.  I feel like this could have been a bit better produced, as I find the lack of cubes to be particularly annoying. This drags the experience down for me.  

There are some interesting elements to the gameplay.  The area control element of the museums and the puzzle of arranging your cards in front of you add some spice.  There's definitely engine-building going on too as you find ways to maximize how many artifacts you can collect on your turn, adventurers, buying upgrades that let you do more things, etc.  Something about it fell flat for me though.  It's OK for me.

Players roll dice, which represent their troop of adventurers, and place them on cards in order to find artifacts, sell them to museums, and purchase new cards representing their company assets. Players can choose to focus on making lots of money by selling artifacts, having museum majorities, creating the best combination of expeditions and buildings, or searching below the waves for lost cities and hidden treasures. The first player to reach 20 reputation triggers the end of the game, and the player with the most total reputation wins!

I really enjoyed my first few plays of this game.  Using your dice as worker placement is a great mechanism to this game.  Even if you have more dice than anyone else, you might not always win.  Every time we have played this game, the person with the most dice hasn't won.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

In this race to 20 points while still being ahead at the end dice worker placement game, I found the game play pretty simple and straightforward. Some people think focusing on the dive breaks the game if no one else does it, but I don't know and I'm uncertain if I care. This is something I would only likely play 2 player due to potential down time issues. The game is simple enough but there is optimizing involved. In the end, it didn't shine enough that it will remain in the collection.

I like Eight Minute Empires: Legends, and this KS looked nice and was inexpensive, so I backed it. The game is okay, nothing to shout about. It's a dice-as-workers placement game, and there's not a ton of dice manipulation, which I like, but there's just not a whole lot going on. I dunno. There's nothing particularly wrong with it, but not much grabs me, either.

Easy to teach and quick to play, this a fun, entry-level dice placement game.  There are some interesting decisions about when to build your engine and when to charge forward with reputation points, while the diving and museum majority mechanisms add variety. The museum pieces are interesting in that they scale for player count, a nice touch.  Typically great Ryan Laukat art and presentation, but the dice and card quality is average.  The small size makes it easy to transport, but it takes up quite a bit of table space.

A fun little dice worker placement game.  And the theme is refreshing.  It would get a slightly higher rating from me if there were some player interaction and less downtime between turns.  The other issue is that in a 2-player game, we tend to run out of cubes, so I had to add generic tokens for tracking artifact inventory on cards.

(Note that we also added a set of dice for each player, which lessens the downtime a little since you can pre-plan your next turn, but it also had an odd effect after a few games of making me less engaged during other players' turns since I already knew what I wanted to do and felt more like I was just waiting around to do it.)

The game is a race, and knowing that is important for good competition.  But even with all players going full throttle  the game is lacking tension so a photo finish results in a polite "well, that was cool i guess" instead of an "oh my gosh, that was sooo close!!"  Good races forces players to constantly look side to side for standing and ways to nudge others off course.  Something about the structure of the game doesn't facilitate either of those activities enough for the end to be climactic.

Another game I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would. The play through just didn't click with me even though I like the theme. Finally got to play the prototype and really enjoyed it. Basically it's a dice rolling engine builder. Find your path to money and points, then upgrade the parts you need to upgrade to get there. The them didn't carry through so much, as we could have been buying and selling whatever, but I do like the concept of the theme that is there.  Very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I initially enjoyed this game, but repeated plays have left it a bit flat for me.  I think my main issue is excessive downtime and just overall long game to depth ratio.  This is a fairly simple, light game, but turns can be a bit tricky once players get several dice and need to decide how to use them.  There's also almost no pre-planning since you don't roll until your turn.  This means waiting usually a few minutes per player for each turn.  And while paying attention to other players is helpful, there's no need to watch every single move and interaction is low, which makes that wait boring.  Deciding how to use the dice on my turn is a fun puzzle and I enjoy it, but even my 2-3 player games have run 60-90 minutes, which is far too long for a game this light.  I think this might work well with a cool solo variant, but as a multi-player game it just drags too much to be enjoyable.

RATING: 6
Dice/worker placement game.  Looks very similar to Castles of Burgundy where your dice are your workers, however you get a lot more workers (3 to start but you can get up to 7 or 8).  The community says it is best 2-3, but i think it is best either 2 or 4. The museum spots are built for 2 and 4.  There is a variant to play one die at a time to give the game a more worker placement feel, as well as shortening the down time between players, I have yet to play this way but am excited to try it.
Cons: Game should have come with enough dice for 4 players to have their own dice, we have ran out of little colored cubes.. really how expensive can those be to add just  a few more of each color?!

This reminds me of Stone Age, and actually prompted me to move that game onto someone else's shelf. The art, as always, is fantastic. Definitely a gem from a talented designer/artist. I will pretty much buy anything Mr. Laukat publishes at this point because you are guaranteed a solid experience.

A cute little dice rolling tableau management game.
It never quite hit the spot for me, but I still enjoyed it.

The problems I had with it was partially the luck of the dice, but also that it was a bit runaway-leadery as the game is so quick. If another person snags a mine that you just can't find you're SOL.

The buildings that grants you extra dice should be locked to one per player so you can always get yours if you want to.

The pacing seems a bit off on the game as a whole, it could've benefited from being a bit longer I'm suspecting.


Still, not a bad game, just not one for me.

Received in Maths Trade - love how big of a game it is for such a small box.

-------------

Finally played this with the right rules. It honestly felt like the game finished a little too quickly, but that may well have been how I was playing. I could see my opponent was creating an impressive artifact generation engine and that I would lose pretty much every museum majority if the game did not come to an end quickly, so I bought buildings and upgraded with the intent of pushing my score up, taking advantage of the adjacency rules etc and beat my opponent to the punch and by more than 10 points. The fact that I could undermine his engine by ending the game soon felt both fulfilling and slightly underwhelming at the same time, which I guess is a masterful achievement in a game? Either way, it was fun!

RATING: 6
This is a great game with two small issues: 1.) In games with more than two players, the player who snaps up the most extra dice will almost certainly win. 2.) There's far too much down time between turns for such a small game.  

Both of these problems could be easily remedied with a few small tweaks.

I honestly liked the thinking when it was my turn. Otherwise, it was really, really, really boring during the other three players turns. I would never play this again at 4p I think. Even after winning, I felt super frustrated at how long it took (90 minutes for a game with filler length level thinking). They shouldve had more dice so more turns could be simultaneous. I just hated playing so much. I was so bored when it wasnt my turn.

PROs: I love how the theme fits the game so well. I also love the dice placement mechanics. But the game within the game is planning which cards and types of cards you place adjacent to each other.

CONs: I've only played this with two people so far. But I can imagine this game might have too much downtime if you played with four players. But with the two players, the downtime was just perfect enough for planning your next move.

I love the art, and the effect the colours create. The components are inssuficient though: it's common to run out of cubes and more dice should have been provided for the players to roll their dice ahead of their turns. The dice are quite poor too.

It's a worker placement card drafting game, where the workers are dice. It also feaures area control and set collection.

It's been designed to be a "short" game, you don't have time to build a big engine, and thus, the player scores are to be tight until the very end. There are also "big combo moves" that grant you many more points per action that any other options; these are usually achieved by placing cards in the right position.

The economic part of the game seems to be very polished: there are several ways to earn money, and besides the "big combo moves", everything seems balanced and well thought. 

But the game presents a number of issues:
-> My main issue is lenght. In 4-player games, [b]the downtime is downright exasperating[/b]. There's not much to plan and nothing else to do during that time. [b]This is what really kills the game for me.[/b]
-> Since the scores will be tight, all might come down to who wins a certain majority, or who manages to buy a specifc card to make a "big combo move". IMO, this is not a satisfying end after carefully planning your moves for an hour or more.
-> On the other side, if you plan for a "big combo move" and another player buys first the lone card you need to activate it, you're hopelessly out of the game; not a satisfying end either, for just missing one card.
-> There are not that many cards. We almost used all of them in a 4-player game. Replayability might be an issue.
-> Minor issue: the initial moves are hardcoded: you need get the 5th dice and develop your buy action asap.

[b]Artifacts, Inc.[/b]

[i]I may end up being in the minority with this one and possibly my judgement is clouded by having played so many dice placement games, but Artifacts fell flat for me. I really don't have much to say because the game has a narrow decision space where everything is the same. Sure you can collect different types of artifacts, but they all function the same so it's a matter of getting what you can with the dice rolled. There also didn't seem to be much variation in the cards you could buy and the spacial aspect of the game was interesting, but again very limited in what you could do based on the placement rules. 

I did enjoy the art, it would have been cool to have different pieces for the artifacts especially since the theme really doesn't come through int he game play. It ends up being a typical Euro optimization game with beautiful artwork. I would play it again if asked, but definitely won't seek it out.[/i]

I can see the comments about how the theme doesn't really feel like it's coming into play.  For those individuals, I'm sure this isn't coming across as a great game.  I think that can be fixed a little just by story-telling a bit as you play.  Instead of "I'm spending this die to buy this card..." you just need to say, "I'm sending this worker off to look in the dig site..." or what have you.  My wife and I enjoyed playing and look forward to future games -- especially since I've already upped the number of small brown dice in the box.

Harmless medium-weight dice game. The card-drafting and dice-rolling mechanics of Machi Koro have been expanded and applied to a adventurer/archaeology theme. Whenever I sit down to play one of these perfectly nice fillers, I feel immediately guilty for not diving into something heavier, or worthwhile. Not bad for a cute little game but kinda on the "why bother?" side for me.

sleeved. The game is great fun. All games have been really tightly contested. I'd probably just play this one with two where I like it best right now (plus most of my gaming is done with my wife). Official variant by designer sounds very interesting. Downtime is unfortunate since there is only so much planning you can do when its not your turn. Variant looks to fix that though and keep things more engaging.

I liked this dice-as-workers game a lot more than the game it replaced for me, which was Machi Koro. The group I played it with didn't like it at all however. One person, who loves Machi Koro was annoyed at the random aspects of this game. The other person, thought the added complexity over Machi Koro's meant that the downtime between turns was too long, and he found himself bored by this game. Then, the next week we played Waggle Dance, which is more fun as a short dice-as-workers game, so I didn't want to hold onto this one.

Simple tableau builder that moves at a nice pace and provides plenty of light strategy. Luck can play a significant factor, since higher rolls are clearly more useful than lower ones, but there are workarounds available to help lessen the blow of a bad roll. Overall, a charming little game that doesn't do anything to stand out.

Not a bad game by any means but nothing new here at all. I think I am tired of the "convert this to this to build my engine for victory points" games.  And it didn't really feel like a dice game.  What you rolled didn't seem to matter all that much, you could always do plenty of actions.  No hard decisions at all.  Card placement for points was annoying to me.  Beautiful artwork though.

As a solo or 2 player game this is one of the few dice-rolling-and-placing-for-actions games that I enjoy. (Cosmic Run is another.) The solo "ghost player" variant by ryanmcmanus, in the files section, is recommended for a laid back session that delivers a tight ending and some different point-making pathways.

Rules are not very well written and a lot of the gameplay sequences are not clearly defined.  We had to guess on a few things during our play and it wasn't until we read the BGG forums did some of the rules clear up.  The gameplay is very dry and very few tough decisions to be made.  It's never a good sign when your wait time is longer than the actual playing time.  Underwhelming!

An excellent worker (dice) placement game. I really like the artwork on the cards and the theme is excellent. One minor quibble is that if the cubes were more thematic (fossils, scrolls, gems etc.) it would be awesome BUT it really would drive up the cost and as it is this is a small foot print and small price point game so I think the trade off is fine (but i might get some upgrade pieces anyway!) In short Ryan Lauket and Red Raven games knocks another one out of the park!

This is a nice light little game.  The cards are pretty dense (not hard to read, just have to really read them and their backs) and I think that as we play this will get easier. (JW)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros:
- Quick to learn and easy to teach
- Many choices to make on how to get your victory points
- Great artwork
- Small box, great for traveling
- Solo compatible

Cons:
- So far, the only quib I have is that an Archaeologist does not typically dig up dinosaur bones.  That is the job of a Paleontologist.  That being said, in the early history of excavation as a business, the lines often blurred as they were more concerned about finding something of import and making money than they were the details of what they found.

Additional Notes:
- Takes up a fair bit of table real-estate.  Not a bad thing if you have the space.
- Takes a fair amount of time to get sorted, shuffled, and setup.  Not a bad thing if you don't mind that sort of thing.

Very fun card/dice game that reminded me of a few different games. It definitely has a worker placement element to it, even though you aren't really interacting with anyone.

Nice and light little dice rolling game. As with all dice games I've come across the more dice you acquire over your opponents the better you'll do. So the start player seems to have an advantage here. Just one extra die over their opponents will be a significant advantage. Not a guaranteed victory, but the odds are definitely in their favour.

On the way the game is a good light mix of choices. When to buy, when to upgrade and who and when to fight for majorities. The artwork is very fitting and the rolls are well thought out. Definitely prefer this over Machi Koro. Unfortunately it's just a little too solitaire for my taste. You might as well almost take your turns simultaneously. Probably best with two players.

Looking forward to more plays with simultaneous dice rolling and placing a dice one at a time in player order.

was a fun game. seems like it is easy to run away with the game if a player manages to get all the adventurer upgrades (extra dice). Also, there is very little player interaction so its a bit tough for other players to catch up on the off-chance there was a runaway player.

One of my favorites, a great worker placement for two players (worker placements usually do not work well with just 2). There is dice mitigation, tableau building, resource management and some territory control. After playing this game to death it seemed certain strategies were better than others. Still a solid game. (Honestly not sure how it plays with more than 2 players)

Artifacts, Inc. feels like a cross between something like Alien Frontiers, with its dice-rolling mechanic, and Splendor, with its optimization snowball. You want to buy cards that will allow you to buy bigger and better cards, and you do so by allocating your dice. Given the variety of card types, there is more variety than a straightforward optimization race like Splendor, but not so much that you feel overwhelmed. In other words, it's pleasantly challenging.

Layer an Indiana Jones theme on top and you have an overall enjoyable game. I wonder at the game's depth and longterm staying power, but for what it is, it's well executed and worth checking out. Bonus points for playing in less than an hour.

MUCH better than Machi Koro. A simple game system, and it seems like there are plenty of ways to use your dice no matter what you roll. That was one of Machi Koro's biggest problems, you were at the mercy of the dice.

However, being better than Machi Koro is a pretty low bar.

I have only played a 3-player game so far and there was quite a bit of downtime (though we were all playing for the first time), so I would definitely avoid this one with four players.

It works. It's a little slow with turns rotating clockwise around the table as there isn't any pieces to fiddle with or really anything at all to do between turns and turns are surprisingly complex. Takes a bit too long for what it is, but I enjoy the puzzle. Go elsewhere though if you want a thematic experience. Glorious cubes!

Choices abound and its not always the best strat to get ALL THE DICE, which is good. Multiple paths to victory. But, won't play with 4 again.

The game starts slowly and ends abruptly, with absolutely no arc whatsoever. I generally am partial to dice allocation games,  but this one lacks any redeeming qualities.  While rolling higher helps,  nearly any die roll is useful - with so many things to do and no time to do them all. There is so much better available in this genre - pass this one by.

Ugh...harmless to the point of absurdity.  Not my kind of game, and perhaps it's my fault for expecting Eight Minute Empire levels of interaction.

I would be curious to play this again with some sort of house-rule that would allow for simultaneous dice rolling or something.

Artifacts, Inc. is an interesting game that just didn't quite work for me. It's a dice placement game where you're trying to be the first person to score 20 points. Most of the game revolves around placing dice on cards that have a space for your dice. Most cards can only accept a single die per turn and while some spots require specific die values, most spots have a minimum threshold you have to meet to place a die there.

You start with some basic cards that give you dice and let you dig up artifacts and buy new cards. There are public actions that you can always take on your turn, including selling artifacts (there are four types) to museums, selling to private collectors (which usually isn't as cool), getting a buck (if you can't do anything else) or diving for treasure (where you can send any number of dice to get a treasure worth a point but the dice value required keeps increasing when every card is bought).

When you buy a new card, it gets placed in your tableau which consists of two rows of cards which can expand infinitely left or right. Each card costs some money (and sometimes a scroll artifact). They give you points (usually) for taking them and sometimes a new ability or power. They can be upgraded for the purchase price which usually gives you more points, and possibly a cooler ability or end of game points (sometimes for how things are placed in your tableau). The new cards let you do cool things like get more dice on your turns, allow you to dig for other artifact types, reroll, change the value of a die by one, get a discount when you buy, etc.

Selling to the museums (each museum likes only one type of artifact) allows you to get a buck for each unit sold and a bonus if the artifact is rarer. When you sell to a museum you place a single cube in that museum and there's a majority contest at the end of the game to get points for each museum. There are only a few spots at each museum that will accept a single artifact. Once they're filled you can only sell multiple artifacts at a time. And after the two spots are filled you can only sell 3 or more, etc.

The game is interesting and there's strategy, but there's two main drawbacks for me... one serious and one gamebreaking. The serious drawback is that this game feels like it should be a light filler and it's just a little bit too much game to fit that mold comfortably. The game goes on for too long to be a filler and is a little heavier than you want in a filler but not heavy enough for a longer game. So it doesn't really fit anywhere that I'd want to play.

The issue that breaks the game for me is that there's an initial race to get more dice, as more dice means more dice placements, and whoever ends up getting an extra die over the other players has a huge advantage. Extra dice disappear quickly at the beginning of the game, after which there's no way to ever get more. In our game one player had four dice, two players had five dice and one player had six. The player with four dice trailed pretty far behind at the end of the game, the players with five dice were neck and neck with each other and the player with six dice was pretty far ahead. So it felt like the game was basically decided in the early game... maybe that wasn't entirely true, but the player with an extra die from had a huge advantage, especially as he had the extra die for the majority of the game.

Overall, I like the theme. I like the art. I like the idea of the game, but it has real problems.

The only time I would suggest a game needs more dice. For some reason has barely enough components to make it through a two player session. There's nothing wrong with the game, just that it feels like a fairly run of the mill Euro style game with a classic adventure theme.

I tend to call this "a better Machi Koro" because it lets you roll several dice and allocate them worker-placement-style. But the Machi Koro part is buying new cards and adding them to your town, with each of those cards being associated with different actions. It's quite a bit heavier than it looks.

While I enjoy Ryan's designs, this one didn't click as well with me as I expected. It's a dice powered worker placement in a vein similar to Kingsburg. Scoring is an odd mix of VPs from cards you purchase, set collection, and area control on the museums. My feeling is that it has a bit too much going on for what it should be.

Backed it on Kickstarter.

The art is beautiful.

A solid game, definitely not the filler I expected. The game it reminds me most of is Tournay, for several reasons: 

A. It's a tableau builder with worker placement

B. Location of cards within your tableau matters

C. The card offer is separated by level 

 I wish that the designer had gone a little bit farther and just made it a full size, standard box game. A little bit more card variety would've done wonders for replayability. My only other (little) complaint has to do with the money - the denominations should definitely at least have been different colors, if not shapes / sizes.

Meh. We just can't get in to this. It might need more plays.

The fact that the opening game is always the same rush to add more dice to your roll seems strange. Why not just skip it and start everybody with more dice? Perhaps we're missing some strategy around that stage of the game?

We also found the Manager to be quite OP (buying cards in future costs less).

Passing dice from player to player gets pretty annoying- you probably want to buy a few more.

More generally, the people I've played this with never really seem to be having fun. It feels like doing simple arithemtic problems. It seems to suffer from this the same way Sentinels of the Multiverse does.

As somebody else mentions, it has similarities to Machi Koro which I also haven't found a way to enjoy yet.

Possibly of course, the game has depths that we haven't found yet- have only played it 5 times or so.

There's no doubt we'll play this some more though.

This game is utterly pleasant. It puts you through the motions of a worker placement game, but it features none of the meanness usually found in that genre. It is almost impossible to block someone out of an action, because if you do there are a myriad of ways for them to work around it. I suppose that is brilliant game design if your target audience is newer or more non-confrontational gamers.

That's not a diss, I think this game is one-hundred percent perfectly designed for its target audience. Unfortunately, I am not part of that audience. I found it to be dull, predictable and almost comically balanced to always generate the same general scoring spread. I love games that either give me a difficult puzzle to solve, or that fire my imagination. The safety valves of Artifacts Inc. take away the puzzle aspects and the dice placement does absolutely nothing to fire my imagination. I don't feel like Indiana Jones when I play this, which makes if very difficult for me to overlook the lack of puzzle solving, decision making or direct conflict.

I was interested in this because of the theme, which comes through a little, but the gameplay is just so meh and uninteresting.

Solid Dice-euro game that feels like it ends just a little too early.  Better balanced than Dice City which needs xpacs.

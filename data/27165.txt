An engine building game that I generally like. Plus it has different objectives set at the start of the game that I really like. the reason I'm not making it higher is because these objectives don't seem to be balanced and the game could be decided on who gets the easiest one to achieve.

Played just once. Very good looking card games with articulated mechanisms. For complexity, strategic options and length it's more similar to a board game than a card game. Definitely it deserves at least another game.

This little exploration card game is fun for me because it plays quickly, allows for some important decisions(which ships should you buy, and should they go exploring or shipping to make you money so you can buy more ships) Plus I always try to get into the theme and I like to go with da Gama or Columbus or Magellan.

[ESP] Un entretenido juego en el que la escaces de dinero es constante. Principalmente debes usarla para btener barcos que deberás enviar a alta mar para cumplir ordenes y decidir por cuanto tiempo se irán. Mientras más tiempo pase mayor será la recompensa pero a la vez más tardará en llegar con lo cual el dinero será aún más escazo. 
También puedes enviar tus barcos al nuevo mundo para obtener PV, pero entonces ya no podrás utilizarlos para embarcar.
Mi mayor crítica son las cartas de objetivo que están desbalanceadas. Sin embargo con la variante de la casa mejora un poco. Vean el video de JcK.

RATING: 4
After a second playing, I'm pretty sure this game has a critical problem: those damn secret mission cards. It wouldn't be so bad if some of the cards weren't much MUCH harder to fulfill than others. But they are, and the point difference isn't high enough to make up for it. Yes, I do realize you should change your play for the secret mission you've got -- but there's still a vast difference, and the fact that the one-ship player scored just one point less for his successful missions than me, the half-ships player, even though we had the same number of trade contracts, is just plain wack, dude.

*If* we play this again, I'm going to propose the following variants: for the starting trade contracts, choose a 3 and 4 from the deck that match your dual-color ship, and everyone has the same open mission to fulfill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Combining a secret mission with what amounts to an influence game results in a unique game that almost works very well.  There is a strong potential for balance issues in the secret mission allocation.  The different missions do not appear to have even footing for completing, thus 1 player may be able to succeed slightly easier than another.  This creates a feeling that the game might boil down to luck of the setup which is unfortunate because the rest of the game is actually pretty good.  The game might shine as a 3 player since 1 mission is out of the game and the 3 players all have face a bit of the unknown.  Not sure how to fix the secret mission part or if it really needs fixing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
With 4 players, I find the chance to get hosed in income coupled  with what -appears- to be a bias towards one of the bonus cards (the "easiest" is significantly easier than all the rest) adds up to an unenjoyable game.  I can see how this might be mitigated with three or even more so with two, but it's not fun with four.  Neat ideas, but it doesn't work.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Neat mechanisms.  However most of the time I was left frustrated because I was unable to do what I wanted to do because the colours available did not match those I wanted.  Reducing the number of colours from 6 to 5 may have helped in this respect.  The starter cards had a similar issue.  The luck issue could have been reduced if the number of colours on these cards had been increased from two to three.  Other changes could have been made to make the game more forgiving.  For example, the value of boats allowed to start an expedition could have been equal or greater for each expedition, not just equal, making more expeditions possible.  I was also left wondering how balanced the mission cards were?  My final gripe is why do designers build into games the potential for players to have a different number of turns?  It is always disappointing to play a game, as we did, only for the winner to have won by a couple of points, which would not have been a winning margin had the next player had the same number of turns to the start player.

RATING: 6.5
First play I drowned in the mechanic and made some dreadful mistakes early on which left me cut off at the ankles for the rest of the game. It appears the approach to each game is framed by the secret mission card, although the mission to occupy all spaces of an expedition seems a tall order to fullfill compared to the one which rewards any involvement. The points allocated don't seem to reflect the difficulty here (but there is probably a balance that I've missed).

Needs a second play but seems more hard work than fun at this stage.

Age of Discovery is the stereotype of a mediocre game. It's not bad. We were challenged, but not thrilled. We had a nice time but no entertainment. And at last: In the German version the component quality is substandard. The graphic is old-fashioned and some thicker card board would be nice.

RATING: 5
I own this game, played it a few times-even did gameplay tutorial/review videos on it. It's a mixed bag at best. The gameplay isn't really engaging, not edge of your seat, and the scoring chart took a while for me to fully understand. Colour matching is simultaneously important/unimportant depending on your strategy, It's needlessly long as you're trying to weigh options between trade contracts, ships, or sending ships out on expedition or trade contracts. It's a delicate balance of offering enough options to not overwhelm players, but in the end it does exactly the opposite-underwhelm. I didn't hate playing this game, but I don't see myself rushing back to it either. It exists...and for those spending $70+ for a brand new game, you want more than just exists.

Interesting concept, and I have faith that the bonus cards are balanced, but ultimately just too processional and dry for my tastes, which is saying a lot.

RATING: 6
For a game of "discovery", this game seems heavily weighted to the trade contracts of the game.  Trade contracts are essential for not only income, but crucial scoring multipliers at the end of the game.  Sending ships on expeditions is mostly a mad dash before scoring rather than a steady build up.

Perfect playing time along with good scaling factor and nice components does this board(card)-game a pleasant experience.
It does take up a lot of playing area!
All the VP will come in the endgame and it can be difficult to see who is in lead before that time arrives. But it all depends on your start and midgame.
There is a lot of complains about the balance in the missions, but I have seen all of them win and with more experience you get better to see through them.

RATING: 8
Surprisingly entertaining.  As you'll discover... in an age.  The end sneaks up very quickly, so you've got to be really careful to make sure you're not stuck with a bunch of ships.  Still, nice trade off between tying ships up/earning income and sending ships off.

The game plays fast and offers interesting choices. However, the special missions are clearly broken, giving one player (who has just to place one ship at as many expeditions as possible) a huge advantage over the others. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The secret mission cards are not balanced, which makes the game less interesting to play.  It is far easier to get one ship in an expedition than it is to solely control an expedition but the point difference between these two extremes is not high enough to compensate for this.  I like the overall flow of the game and the balancing of income production vs. victory points, but can't see myself playing the game again without balancing out the secret missions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Decent game, pleasant enough and works well but a bit dry and procedural despite the promise of the title so theme junkies beware.  

Health warning - we've only ever played without the goal cards - never did get around to trying them - I suspect they may work once you know the game but we were concerned they were unbalancing before then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
UPDATE: I do enjoy this game, but it's become clear that the roles are messed up. The "presence" (at least one ship) is out of line with the others. I think the fix is comparatively easy: drop its multiplier by 1 (so at the maximum, it's 4 instead of 5). It may not be quite right, but it'll be a lot better. To get 5 for a presence when you only get 6 for "at least as many" seems to me a little ludicrous. 4 feels better to me.
---
Despite the initial equivocal reactions from others who had played it before me, I rather liked Age of Discovery. It's a typical infrastructure/VP balance game, with the players choosing between spending their money on things that generate VPs directly and things that make them more money. What I like about it was it's tightness: money is really short, and you have to make some really tough calls about your investments. Like in Emira, you get expeditions that you have to choose how long to tie your money up in: a short expedition for a smaller payoff, a longer one for a bigger one. These choices, and then the subsequent ones over whether to invest in large or small ships, are where the game is.

Its interesting to compare Age of Discovery to Phalanx' contemporary Before the Wind. They both have similar-ish shipping themes, and no question that Before the Wind is both cleverer mechanically and much more beautifully presented. But for me, Age of Discovery hangs together much better. The turn-to-turn decisions you make are more direct and more challenging, and the game is less repetitive. It's also thematically tighter, in large part because the cash investment actions here make sense (in AoD, you invest you cash in buying ships. In BtW, you invest in ... what exactly? Actions, but those actions are thematically abstract and unevocative).

The fear is for replayability, and it's definitely a serious concern - there is not a huge amount of variability on offer here. But it's a small-box game, so half-a-dozen plays would be nice. Not sure I'll get there, but I like to remain optimistic. A game to get at a discount place rather than pay full retail for.

One play - an okay game.  There were some interesting and challenging decisions, but I'm not sure that they weren't invalidated by having poor contract draws (meaning it's harder to make money).  On the other hand, no one at the table invoked their color-changing powers until the end of the game, so perhaps that would have balanced the poor card draws out a bit better.  Would be willing to try again, but not something I'd ask to play so it'd have to be someone else's idea.

Players supply famous expeditions of well-known explorers like Columbus and Magellan with their ships. They have to purchase these ships and cleverly direct them to the most successful expeditions. Of course, they need a lot of money for this! The players receive income by accepting trade assignments with their ships. In the end, the player who received the most victory points by assigning ships to expeditions and fulfilling his special contract wins the game.

Theme is a little weak, choices are not that tough, and has a good amount luck.  That said, I still liked it after my first play.  It's pretty standard fare...you have 2 actions with which to choose cards, money, or VPs.  And the cards are the vehicle with which to earn money and VPs.

Are the mission cards unbalanced?  I got the one that rewards a presence of a ship in each expedition.  That was the easiest one IMO and the end-game points for it were substantial.

I was disappointed with this title.

It was a bit confusing. Maybe a second game will be better. It's not easy to see what is best action to do during your turn. There is alot to take in for your first game. With a second play, it should go smoother. That is if I understand more what am doing and why am doing a particular action. Rules are very confusing when you never played before.

It seemed unbalance. Rather light for a board game. Not sure that the re-playability is very high for this game.

There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time.

Ok, people talk about the problems with the bonus scoring cards...and I think that IS a problem, but I like some of the suggested fixes for this, the best of which seems to be forcing the players to choose their bonus at the time of first scoring.  Money's tight throughout the game, so often your entire move is taking money on a turn (which can also seem tedious).  However, there's some nice tension as you try to determine when it's best to shift strategy from getting money to sending ships out for victory points.  The fact that you have time once the scoring cards come up to make that shift is an important part of the rules that I think a few people missed when they first played the game.

Not bad. It's got the whole "play to get money, then play to get VPs" Euro feel to it, with the added twist of needing to decide what/when is the best investment payoff and when to commit the ships to long term expeditions. Am concerned that subsequent games are going to feel similar though. And one big problem which I'm surprised the designer and playtesters never caught - the One Ship special mission card is way powerful compared to the others.

Some quite interesting decisions here as to go for positions before time runs out vs get new ships vs let your investments ride for a bigger payout.

What a dry, boring game. On top of that the bonus mission cards (or whatever) that each player gets are extremely unbalanced, particularly if you get stuck with the absolute monopoly card (which is nearly impossible to achieve with more than 2 players). Tom Vasel is wrong. Avoid this like the plague!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Rating is based on two plays (one three player, one four player).  The basic mechanics are reasonably sound.  I think the game is fundamentally flawed though at the moment:
a) the secret mission cards (that earn bonus VP's) aren't balanced in my view.  The get a ship on each mission is much, much easier than any of others.  I know there is a points differential, but I don't think it is enough.  I know that others have mentioned this, and that there is the option of "choosing" your secret mission.  
b) getting a 3 ship contract that you can complete with your opening ship skews the game substantially in your favour. You get more cash a turn or two earlier and can expand so much quicker - which in turn brings more money and contracts.  The three player start last night has one player with a matching contract, and the other two of us had 5 and 6 ship contracts, and the same was true of the contracts on display. That needs a reasonably hefty second ship - which takes turns to save up for at 2GP per turn.  
Too flawed for me to sing it's praises at the moment.

Kártyaalapú, okos kis stratégiai játék, ami viszonylag gyorsan lezavarható egy kis tapasztalattal. 

A játékban hajókat kell vásárolnunk, és azokat kereskedelmi utakra, illetve expedíciókra küldeni. A kereskedelmi út pénzt termel, az expedíció győzelmi pontot. Mindenkinek van egy titkos küldetése is, ami a játék végé plusz pontokat jelenthet. Ez ügyesen kapcsolja össze az expedíciókat a kereskedelmi utakkal, így nem lehet csak az egyikre koncentrálni.

Bár négyesben játszottunk, valamiért olyan érzésem van, hogy ez a játék nagyon jó lehet kettesben is.

Simán lehet a 7-es osztályzatból még nyolcas is, de egy játék után nem merek 7-nél többet adni semmire. :)
--------------
7-ből 6.5 lett, mivel érzésem szerint túl nagy a kezdeti szerencse súlya. Akinek a hajójához illeszkedő küldetések jönnek fel az elején, az szinte behozhatatlan előnyre tesz szert.

The game is well structured, clear and yet offers a few ways to score and win. There is some randomness but it's not decisive in determining the winner. Nice graphics helps to feel like a discoverer and an overall impression is really good.

Maybe I'll change my mind with time and some more plays but so far it's a keeper.

Quick game with nicely conflicting strategies to consider.  I wonder if it might have been better to have the special missions as a "advanced game" option, letting newbies learn the base game system first.  But I think you will need the special missions to spice the game up longer term. After 2nd game I'm still not sure the mission cards are balanced -the fill-all-ships one you have to work hard at it.

First played July 26th, 2007.  This takes a bit to figure out (15 min for rules once familiar).  We played our first game with 3 players which took about an hour.  After the first several rounds it was starting to make sense.  You will have to play at least twice to know what to do.  There are so many options or so it seems.  I think once you've played it once it won't seem so complicated.  The mission cards needed further explaination as none of us completly got it until mid-way through it.  I'd strongly recommend giving this a couple of game plays and consideration in placing in your rotation of games to play on a regular basis.  Just make sure to write the first game off as a learning experience.  Update; played as 2-player game and took about 90 minutes.  Mission cards seemed unfair as one had monopoly and the other had have at least one.

A lot of interesting decisions to be made in this game: will I buy some ships or will I make more money for the next turn or will I send my ships on the mission… Oh Oh… It is hard to guess the right timing when you start fight for the victory points since the game ends due to a surprise effect! Very exciting!

I really like this game. It packs a lot of tough decisions in 45 minutes of playing time.
In the three games I've played so far I've seen three different mission cards win. I think that the game has so many factors that it's really difficult to judge the balance of the mission cards without playing it a few times with experienced players.
A bad starting hand (two high valued contract that doesn't match the color of your ship) can 
cause you more problems than a "tough" mission card.

This is after one play, so please take it with a grain of salt.  Many of the criticisms I've read about this game revolve around the imbalance of the secret missions.  My own peeve so overwhelmed that difficulty that I can't even say for myself whether or not I agree with this position.  Much more imbalanced, in my mind is the randomness of the assignment of Flag Ships.  The person who ran away with the game was the one whose flagship matched the colors of the first small and large trade cards available.  This gave him an economic advantage that was impossible to overcome.  By the way, he also had the "hardest" secret mission.  His final score was off the scoring track, and the next best score was about 60.  This is in spite of the fact that my own strategy (earning a score of 60) was almost identical - but my flagship didn't match any of the first 6 trade missions available to me (including purchasing "blind").  Frustrating that a game that revolves around economic efficiency then trusts that efficiency to mechanisms that are completely random.  

Am I missing something here?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Wow, this is sort of a brain burner.  The true essence of this game lies with you secret mission card.  You must play your strategy based on what special mission card you received in the beginning of the game while in the mean time gathering points along the way.  The reason to focus your strategy on you special mission card is because 80% of you victory points comes from your special mission.

I like the game.  While the theme is definitely nothing new, I tend to enjoy this type of money/victory point balancing games.  I can definitely see people's complaints about the mission cards being unbalanced, but it didn't seem to be too much of a problem for us just yet.  I wonder if you could play where each player simply chooses his/her own mission.  I like that it plays quickly and forces you to really time things right.  I'd like to play this more and develop some more substantial thoughts on the game.

There's really only one strategy to victory in this game and if you don't adhere to that strategy then you will spend the whole time in a sort of penniless funk as you burn your money as soon as you get it trying to just get ships sent out. Midgame scoring is pointless and just penalizes people who thought it would be a good idea to send out ships on expeditions early in the game (hint: it is NOT a good idea to do so). The game is cold, boring, and generally a waste of good shelf space. That generic Mayfair insert does actually hold the components properly though...

Essentially an engine/building game of acquring ship cards in order to send those ships on either, (a) voyages for income, or (b) expeditions for victory points.  The tricky part is that there are six ship types of values 1 to 3 and when you send them for money, those ships return but if you send them on expeditions/VPs they are permanently done for the rest of the game.

Not a bad game, I normally love this sort of game, but it was too light to make me go crazy.

RATING: 3
Rating will probably go up with more plays. 
It took a few turns to figure it out, and I still forgot about one crucial part in the rules regarding the special mission scoring. 

Remember the Contracts!

This rating could probably go up, but with an improbable draw I was struggling to do anything for several rounds which made the game a little frustrating. Combine that with expensive contracts and a difficult secret mission to really top it off. With that said, I still think it's an interesting game and I'd like to play again.

Update: after a year or so of playing this, I realize that this was the end of the honeymoon with boardgames. I realized that there's a game I just don't like. Ever since I've become picky.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A decent economic game where players purchase ships then send them out on trade contracts (to make money) until they have earned enough to send the ships out to discover the new world (to gain VPs).  It's a clever game where the player with the most foward-moving parts and momentum is going to win.  The voyages score twice and can be locked out so there are also some very interesting timing choices... especially since when you send a ship out for VPs it never returns which means you'll need to purchase further ships in order to continue competing.  I lost my first game by getting behind the curve early on... something I certainly won't let happen again.  I don't think it's going to wow too many people but it's not meant to be a long meaty game.  It should play in less than an hour unless you're in my game group where it took 3.5 hours.

RATING: 7
Some very nice elements I enjoy in this one.  Has the feel of a bigger game because you have to spread it out all over the place. One of my favorite games in the 45 minute category which also includes Metropolys, Finca, and Mykerinos.  Great balance between deciding on VP vs. Money throughout the game.  I've only played it two player, and saw no trouble with play balance (being able to win with the 'tough' secret missions and a tricky opening flagship/contract combo).  There are variants to solve this if you think they are issues.

8/26/12- 7: So after around 5 plays this game ranks a 7. One of the major issues with it, are the rules are pretty vague. It took us 3 plays, reading everything in the forum to really understand the rules correctly. 

I like that it plays pretty fast. I personally like how much of a brain buster it is near the end of the game. My wife a little less so. Will update after 10 or so more plays.

10/26/2017- While we enjoyed it during it's time when our collection was smaller, as we've gotten a larger collection it's really not hit the table in years. I'll probably sell it off.

I really like this game. my wife finds it too long, but I don't mind the length. I love how you set the distance of your trade voyages; the further they are, the longer those boats unavailable, but longer voyages mean more profits! Not sure why more people don't talk about this game here.

RATING: 6.6

Simple and classic economic game with 2 basic decisions: invest on growth or in points. Fast paced and entertaining.

On the other side, the balance of the endgame point cards might be compromised. But most important, the game has a strong snowball effect: if you have a bad start, you won't be able to catch up, and nobody will be able to catch a runaway leader (unless he commits a big mistake, something very unlikely, because you get 1 turn warning before scoring).

Edit: Maybe I was too hard on the game. I did that because I thought the endgame point cards were unbalanced, and none of the solutions offered by the game author convinced me. They punished the first players and favoured the last one (the one who drew the endgame card), because he's allowed to do the final placing of the boats anc conform the final configuration. Nonetheless, I didn't realize that this player is punished because as he places his boats in the last place, he will find some full sites and will lose points because of this. In our game, that only made us lose a few points, but it might be balanced.

Played once at Origins 2007, anxious to play it again.  I like the mechanic of sending off your ships -- sending them on money-making expeditions gives them back to you a few turns later, but sending them on victory-point expeditions locks them up for the rest of the game.  Final (secret) scoring mechanic seems to keep final victor hidden until end of game.

Essentially one continual money vs points tradeoff decision to make. With money so tight, the game seems to come down to luck of how, if and when your coloured contract cards come out and how, if and when your ships come out. It's overbearing. Combined with the forced way you must play from your bonus cards, it all seems overbearing. At least the decisions are interesting along the way. If luck is even, I don't mind playing. Frustrating otherwise.

Based on one play (2 players): Quite complex for a card game, more of a board game with a lot of card components. The game takes a while to get the hang of, after explaining it and thinking it through at first, you wonder how you will get enough cash since you are so limited in the first few turns. Once the game gets going, you see that there is a sequence to the play. You must first use ships in trade contracts to get cash and then place them for points in the expeditions, but don't wait too long or others will steal you spot. The reserve cards are almost worthless in a two player game, the start up is slow and there are way too many cards of different sizes in your hand, but all in all, it has potential and I somewhat enjoyed my first play.

A worthy twist on the area majority genre, where timing and an important unique bonus goal add an extra dimension. The game probably plays better with three - keeping one of the bonus objectives out of play and giving the players a little more control than in the crowded four player game. I like how the game keeps ticking over with the limited actions possible, yet the choice of which two actions to take can be a hard one. You have to keep an eye out for what the other players are doing, It's kind of fun too. Quality of components is a surprise - everything seems about half as thin as it should be to pass as durable. Great concern that the mission cards are not balanced - the only player on an expedition mission will rob that player of income and VPs (by encouraging the use of larger ships). I suggest a VP auction for the mission cards at the beginning of the game (best for experienced players), as auctions always have a way of balancing these things out.

RATING: 6
Again a card game about building a victory point machine and comparing your harverst of points at the end of the game. Nevertheless, this time everything is more straightforward and less convulated, since one part of the game is clearly to gain money and the other is the hunt for the points. There is no tricky card symbols to be decoded and no big combos to be found.  Just get the money and go for the points, which is not necesary bad, at least for a few games. Although, in the long run, this could mean that probably the game could burn quicker and get repetitive, but I haven´t play that much to assure it.

Still seems to me to be very dependent on the bonus card you get at the beginning of the game.  Fairly interesting though and definitely the "type" of game I like--spend money, make more money.  Not quite enough here to promote it to the next level of games.

RATING: 5
Harmless allocation game with same odd choices (why limit expeditions by color?  what decisions are prompted by the cargo limits?)  An attractive package, and the decisions about money now vs VPs later are solid.

After one play, I liked this game a decent amount.  I liked the balance between making money and earning victory points.  I thought some of the mechanics, like choosing how long to send ships on a trade voyage were unique and thematic.  However, I wonder if there is some imbalance in the special mission cards.

There is a lot to take in initially, but as soon as the game gets going it chops along rapidly.  This is a refreshing design in that it offers what most midsized Euros do without overstaying it's welcome. Once everyone is familiar with how the system works, it really is a quick game.  There is a wonderful balance to all the moving parts of the game and the economic system just ramps ups as you try to churn all your actions effectively to get your ships out for the scoring.  

They system feels very generous to the needs of the player.  In a strange way the game feels very considerate of player styles and allows for people to play the system how'd they like and with the special cards it allows for quite a bit of flexibility. 

My only real concern is, as much as I'd like to believe that the Secret Mission cards are balanced, I'm just not sure.  If you play without them, things get a little screwy as people just play from the top down on the Explorations.  I like look of the Spielbox variant: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/184057.  I'm looking forward to playing the game again with this.

----------
The Good:
- cheap ($20-25)
- fast: plays in about 45 minutes
- well made: could have been a board, but the tiles work pretty well, are reasonably sturdy, and nice to look at
- tough decisions: timing (how long to invest in contracts, when to buy ships, when to go on expeditions, when to anticipate/control the game end, when to use your single-use cards) is important, money management is tough

The Bad:
- balance: It seems as if some Special Mission Cards are significantly harder to achieve than others, with the VP award not appropriately adjusted.
- luck: setup (which ships and contracts come out, which dual color ship and contracts a player is dealt)

Overall, a good game probably worth having although there may be some balance issues (fixable with variants?). A large part of it seems to be timing -- when to make money and when to start sending ships on expeditions. The Special Mission Cards, however, seem way too unbalanced - some conditions are MUCH easier to satisfy than others ... probably need to play with a variant where you get to PICK your own Special Mission (at the beginning? at the end? at first scoring?).

RATING: 6
Drafting games are right up my alley and there's an economic aspect here too that I usually like.  It's not bad, yet it still falls flat for me.  Why is that?  It's a bit too dry and it feels a little claustrophobic.  Maybe it's the small pieces or the mission cards.  Also, the setup for the game is fiddly enough to the point where I screwed up two games in a row.  Oops!  Still a good game despite those flaws, just missing that something special, and I have a feeling I might like it more than the average gamer.

RATING: 6.5
It's a game with decent mechanics, and a three-some flow:
1. Get a money engine going
2. Get a fleet build up
3. Rush to the score pile by doing expeditions

However, it suffers from three main drawbacks.
1. Very tough economics at start: it is very easy to lose in the first 10 minutes of a 50 minute game.
2. The order in which contracts come out determine quite a big part of the game. If you happen to have a flagship matching the first '3' contract your economic engine is off and you'll have a huge lead on all the others, and a guaranteed win if you don't mess up.
3. 'Random' draw of the end means it could be over in turn 1!! This is what really bugs me, as you never know what the right strategy would've been until the end has come and gone. Some call this 'tension', but that would be the case if you could adjust your strategy to incorporate unfortunate events. Sadly, you can't, you are quite linear in that aspect.

Gameplay itself is quick,  it has decent mechanics and the triple game-flow is nice. The random end, 'king-making' contracts draw and unforgiving starting economy bring it severely down. OK, but not great.

RATING: 7
A nice card-driven game of exploring and trading in the age of wooden ship, although the theme is pretty thin and the game is fairly abstract. What makes this one a keeper is the many difficult decision points players face, especially in regards to exactly when some of a player's fleet should break off it's money-generating merchant missions and embark on point-scoring voyages of exploration. Age of Discovery moves along at a pretty good clip and has some real depth despite its small box size. If theme and mechnics worked together a bit better - enough so that you felt like a Renaissance financier investing in a fleet of ships - I would rate this even higher. As it is, the game is streamlined, involving and interesting to merit repeat plays.

RATING: 6.5
Played once two-player. Lots of things going on in this game. Buy ships. Buy trade contracts. Get money. Send ships on trade voyages to get even more money. But one has to keep an eye out on the expeditions to make sure that one does not get locked out of getting the VPs from going on expeditions. Probably works equally well with 3 and 4 players.

RATING: 8
Simple rules, amazing components, unique game mechanics, intriguing game play. This is a solid 9.

This is a great game. Although the rules are simple, you need to play it once to understand the long term mechanics of the game. The components are top notch and the colors and art is great.
People complain that the 4 missions are not %u201Cbalanced%u201D, but I have found that are all balanced if you know the game. If you play the game for the first time, then I agree that the missions are not %u201Cbalanced%u201D.
I will give it an 8 and not a 9 because of the missions, but for a completely different reason. I wish they had put more than 4 missions! The game would had endless possibilities. I hope there will be a mini expansion for this great game.

Played once with the wrong rules and I won!  Played a 2nd time with correct rules and won again!  While it's a good game, there's just something about it that doesn't capture my fancy.  Maybe it's the lack of direct player interaction, but not sure.

RATING: 5
I have only played this once, but it felt quite difficult to work out what I should be doing each turn. I won the game almost by accident, as I happened to be able to commit a large number of ships to expeditions on the turn the final scoring card came up. My opponent, well ahead all game, was waiting for trade contracts to mature and was unable to contribute much. It deserves further plays.

RATING: 7
First play only so far.  Big mistake all but one of us made was that you need to go for cash early.  The game ended on the turn I had my second contract about to happen.
There is more going on than initially meets the eye, and I'm not sure how balanced some of the Special Missions are - getting all the ships on more than two expeditions is hard! 

But the artwork is lovely, the theme quite nice and the bits nicely done.  It has a feeling of Alhambra for me, waiting to buy a ship and watching the player before you snatch it from under your nose, or play a ship to an expedition which beats you to that score too.

Needs another play, but suspect I will generally prefer Alhambra - this just isnt explorey enough to be a different game about exploring.

Despite what anyone may say, the mission cards ARE unbalanced (hint - if people are saying "oh, well, all the other players just have to play to make sure the holder of a particular card doesn't run away with the game" - it's not balanced). I'm sure a variant could be developed to fix that, but really, why bother? There's nothing particularly novel about the game, nor is the system that wonderful - it's OK, but I can't see ever rating it higher than 6.

Provisional rating, one play, without the mission cards - though perhaps I ought not to rate it at all, not having played the game as the designer intended,  Without some sort of individual goal, it seemed bland, yet reading about them, I'm unconvinced they would make the experience better.

(After 1 3p gmae and 1 4p game)  Clean design, colorblind friendly (symbols) - very much a German game of maximization - optimazation - efficiency.   Not much player interaction.  Some of the discovery cards appear unbalanced, but need future plays to determine if that's the case.   Felt like some secret mission cards were difficult to accomplish - but with more experience the game play should get "tighter".  If your wild ship does not match one of your initial free contracts it gets tough - might consider allowing players to redraw contracts of redraw wild on next play.

There are some neat things going on in this game, but it seems overly complicated and convoluted to be a truly great game.  The contracts versus the expeditions is a nice balancing mechanism, and the game is designed in such a way as to force you to pay attention to the contracts.  It just seems a little too "more of the same," and it seems also to be a little too dependent on the luck of the draw, especially where the ships and the scoring cards are concerned.  Timing is important, but you can't ever know for sure when that timing will be.

After a couple of plays, I think that the mechanics and theme of the game are really fun, but I'm not sure that the game is balanced.  I won in a romp in the first game.  However, I had two advantages - my initial trade cards both matched my flagship, and I had the easy mission card.  This was clearly an anomaly, but I'm not sure that something like this should happen in a well thought out game.  In the second game, there was no "easy mission card" in play, but after playing the game, I feel pretty sure that the easy mission card is way too easy, and the hard one is way too hard.  This is a game that might have been really good if it would have been perfected, but I think it needs a fair bit of work to be really good.

With regards to mechanics it's a descent and interesting design (a typical infrastructure/VP balance game where money is very tight). How ever I do miss interaction and overall atmosphere. That's said, it's definetly a game you should try.

After 1st play. 
Start was chaotic, but finally I really enjoyed the game (unless we played slightly against to the rules). 

After 2nd play.
Again 2 player game, we ended after 1st scoring (41:23). 
In some way it's game about patient economy building and I tried to catch some VP to early :/

Played once (with 4 players). This game has several clever ideas, and while it is rather simple, asks for interesting decisions of both strategical and tactical nature. I like the way the number of fulfilled contracts determines the value of your missions (although I cannot really think of a thematic explanation - not that it bothers me). However, two problems prevented me from enjoying the game more, and I cannot see why they wouldn't arise again in subsequent plays: a minor issue is that depending on whether none, one or both of the colors in your wildcard ship are shared with other players, you will have more or less competition of the contracts it can help fulfill (but I am ready to admit it is an incentive to use a different strategy). The major issue, however, is the unbalance of the different missions - it is much easier to get a presence in an expedition than to get a majority of the ships, yet the difference in points scored is rather small. This problem might have been magnified by the fact most of us were beginners at the table; still, it does quite dampen my will to play again.

Age of Discovery is a fine game.  You've got tactical stuff going on, some strategic stuff going on, along with resource and timing management.  That said, a lot of what you're doing feels same-y, and some of the time it doesn't seem as though you have very many good options to choose from on your turn.  Good enough to play now and again.

Tempted to give it an 8 but I have to play it some more to check the balance of the bonus cards. Some of my group are convinced that the game is unbalanced - I would love to correct them :) If so this game can easily climb up to an 8 or even a 9! With the 'bad taste' of a possible not soo balanced game it's a 7 - after all there are lots of variants published already.

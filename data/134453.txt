Nice set collection game with a charming theme and simple rules. Plays fast and well - great, original filler. It has only a touch of screwage in it - just enough spice to give it some zip. Very enjoyable! But I have no one in my family who likes it. Perhaps its too odd in theme?

When I first heard of The Little Prince I got a little sceptical. Surely this would be another bad game aiming to exploit the IP of the original story. But I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised because the game actually works and offers some fun. And this certainly is not a children’s game although kids can play it as well. This is because the mechanic used to give tiles to players requires a rather thorough analysis if you want to play competitively (i.e. a lot of chances for king making). The game is suited for casual players as well since it is simply fun and satisfying to build your own little planet. I also love the art of the game (which is where the original IP is used). 

The analysis part is the biggest caveat of the design because it brings the game into a complete halt regularly. Some other mechanism for choosing who gets the tiles and which tile to take could have been in place. But this is just a minor thing.

A really nice, quick, draft-based tile-laying game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I played this game just twice, so this are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm surprized by how much I enjoy this simple tile laying game. The core mechanism is a sort of "I split, you choose" mixed with a hint of bluffing and push your luck, that creates some interesting decisions. What I like even more though is the interactions between the tiles: the volcanoes, the terrible baobabs and especially the characters! Everything about this game is extremely simple, but it's still so fun to build these planets and create a simple strategy to follow.

Maybe it's because I used to love "The Little Prince" as a kid and this game has the original artwork from the book... but this game just touches something inside of me. I find it really really fun!

I've played the prototype.

A very nice filler, that's probably suitable for all ages. Surprisingly deep for a kid-friendly game. I think a kid would have to be at least ten to play it well!

The challenge in this tile-laying game lies in deciding who's going to go after you. That is NOT an easy decision, and it is actually far more important than which tile you've chosen!

I am unfamiliar with the novel this game takes as its source.  That doesn't make me immune to seduction by some rather pretty artwork.  The game we get to play with the pretty tiles is a simple drafting affair, with a sting in its tail in that you're trying to leave those drafting later in the round with a bad selection.  Having a completed planet of your own at the end of it all is somehow more satisfying than a Carcassonne-like amorphous blob.  An OK filler.

Choosing who is going to pick the next tile, is where the  game is different to other tile laying games.
There is also a push your luck element with the baobab trees. You can feel the 'panic' - just as described in the book - once you end up with two of those on your planet again.

Irtó egyszerű a szabály, de a játék szerintem nagyon jól sikerült, nem csalódtam a szerzőkben! Még csak a két személyeset próbáltuk, ahol kicsit más a kiválasztási mechanizmus, mint a 3-4 fősnél, de az első parti alapján szuper. Kevés olyan játék van, amit akár kisgyerekkel is lehetne játszani, mégis ennyire leköt. Gyors, pörgős, izgalmas, szerintem bárki megverhet bárkit.
A névadás kicsit hatásvadász, a téma csak a grafikában jelenik meg, de ez megbocsátható. Már csak azért is, mert ha krumplik és banánok lennének mondjuk a róka vagy a kígyó helyett, akkor szerintem nem tetszene ennyire:) 
---
Na kipróbáltuk hárman is, így azért elég durván benne van a királycsinálás lehetősége, de gondolom pont emiatt találták ki a titkos célválasztós variánst...
---
10+ parti után, és kb. 10 embernek megmutatva elég vegyes a fogadtatás. Vélemények: "gyerekjáték"; "családi játék"; "semmi különös"; "bugyuta";  "ez jóóóóó"; "jaj de jó, szeretem a Kis Herceget"; "jaj de utálom a Kis Herceget"...:) Azt hiszem nekem azért tetszik, mert bár kb. az egyszerűbb kártyajátékok (Nincs kegyelem, Vigyázz6, Coloretto stb.) szintjén áll nehézségre, és hosszra, azoknál mégis több.

Great surprise.  The theme used may make you think of this as a child game, but as with the book, this is not true.

RATING: 6.5
Very simple and straightforward tile-laying game for children and non-gamers.
The idea of using Saint-Exupery's original artwork is great and provides most of the flavor to the game.
The game lasts 16 turns, in which every player collects 16 tiles to build his/her planet.
During e each turn, the (rotating) first player draws a number of tiles (from a specific stack) equal to the number of players and chooses one, then other players choose one of the remaining tiles in turn.
12 of the tiles have various features (snakes, elephants, baobabs etc.) and 4 have some sort of score multiplier.
Everything is simple and can easily learnt by kids.
Can't wait to play this with the daughters!
Rating is 8 with the kids (I guess) and 5 with the normal adult scale, so it deserves a 6.5...

This is a lovely little game. It really reminds me the sweet part of the story of "the little prince." I feel like reading the book again.

A tile placement game with some interesting mechanisms for taking / passing tiles (this part can get pretty nasty...).  I know nothing about the theme, but it for sure wasn't for me. Something I'd be happy to play any time, but not something I'd look to acquire.

2013. tile drafting, set coll.

silly name but seems like a gamer-y set collection game that could also work for kids. could be painful if everyone calculates the value of every tile in the draft. definitely could suffer from the inexperienced/inattentive player issue... "I lost the game because of your dumb move/choice". getting to choose who picks next from the tile draft is very powerful. variant where you semi-secretly choose the scoring tiles sounds slightly better (more trying to memorize/guess what scoring tiles people took and less of a public/perfect information game with constantly the value of each tile for each player).

A Beautiful game. And a nice variety of scoring mechanisms. Definitely light for an adult, but enough meat and depth for an adult + child experience.  Especially if they have read the book.  Which everyone should do anyway.  Art work is great, and the game fits the book nicely.  Rating is for this combo - adult + kids who know the book.  It would probably be a 7 for adults only and a 7.5 for adults + kids who don't know the book.

a solid filler tile laying game with a bit more viciousness than I would have expected from Bauza.  2-player is definitely gentler than 3.  Probably the most versatile game I own.  Plays great with all player counts and in all locations (planes, beaches, camping, etc.).  Plays great with gamers, non-gamers, kids, families.  Short learning curve and all about messing with each other.  Great, great fun.

Cute, light, relaxing game. Nothing profound here, but the game is beautiful as the planets get laid out, and really captures the story for anyone who has ever read the book. Also a great game to play with kids.

I've only played two-player, with the one-tile-down rules, which is simultaneously interesting and frustrating. I'd like to try with three or more to have more of a choice (or at least to see what I'm getting!).

The flow and mechanic of the Game itself is pretty good. However, it is not a game for family. The theme of the game is only supported by the pictures but the soul of the game is far away from the main idea of the original story. 
The game is going to ruin the other planets and achieve highest mark from counting number of items in your own planets. During the player selection, it may give lots of brutal interaction in game for kids.  

You know, the original story is talking about the little prince had found this secret and discovered what the most important thing of his life was after a long and eventful journey.  In the story, we had learned with the little prince about deep friendship and understanding. The game itself does not have any problem, but it gives some of the bad impression about the sublime character of my "Little Prince".

That's just precious. Doesn't hurt that two of my favourite designers are working on it, either.

This is fairly good. The cutesy theme and the astounding artwork belies how cutthroat this game can be when not playing with hidden characters. I feel that some of the characters can be screwed when playing with three players (due to how many tiles are taken out) and I wouldn't mind some more geometrical elements (the King should definitely get some points for being on the opposite side of the planet to some animals). I like how there is a stark contrast between solid middling point gainers and high-risk, high reward ones.

A quick and simple little tile-based filler about placing a 4x4 grid to build a planet.   Connections aren’t a factor, so it comes down to collecting sets of things that give you points, and avoiding a couple types of penalties.    The catch is that the players can control when their goals are established by drafting the corner scoring tiles.   Played early, you know exactly what you (and the other players) will need.   Played late, and you are taking some risks that could pay off big, or yield nothing.    Kind of clever, in that regard.  The game is cruel enough to make children weep.

I was hoping this would combine Kingdomino tile laying with a simplified 7 Wonders point scoring, since it’s a joint effort by those two designers. After reading the rules, I imagined that the open draft, along with the choice of player turn order, would make the game more interactive than either of those. I don’t like the isolating feeling of secretly drafting in a game like 7 Wonders, and so I really liked the increased interactivity and shared discussion of this. I also liked the risk of losing points to volcanos and trees. It does require you to prioritize thwarting everyone else’s plans, which I greatly enjoy. I think Kingdomino is a friendlier, quicker, and more accessible game worthy of its Spiel des Jahres award, but I liked this one’s increased interactivity.

The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet was getting good feedback at London on Board as a cute thinky filler. And it is exactly that. It sort of sits in a bit of gaming no-mans land for me though: it is too dry and thinky for my children (teens) who require a bit more action in their games, and yet also it suffers the same problem as an end of evening quick filler after a good euro-strategy gaming session. At that point of an evening you want less thought than this requires. Nevertheless it is a decent game and one I would gladly play when the time is right.

il pretesto del flavour è molto accattivante e ho visto decine di persone scegliere di giocarci solo per quel motivo. Personalmente non sono la fan numero uno del Piccolo Principe, anzi, ho sempre avuto una certa antipatia per il personaggio e alcuni disegni per me sono troppo piccoli e non così chiari (vedi colore pecore).
Al di là di tutto ciò la dinamica di gioco poi in realtà mi piace! Attenzione a non proporlo a bambini troppo piccoli da soli.

Really goes over well with new gamers as this is pretty simple game from what happens during a turn.  Just enough "take that" interaction to stay interesting.  Also fun because every time we play there is new characters for scoring so the world always looks different.

Beautiful, light but with a real depth. There are different level of play. Light player will be pleased building there planet trying to get the better part each phase. Harder player will be delighted with the possibility to disturb other players plans.
A lot of talks, a lot of possibilities and all of that in so little time!
Wonderful

RATING: 5.5
Very pleasant little tile laying game where you draft tiles and scoring is based upon which characters you draft. It probably needs a player aid for what the characters do and we all found the scoring track on the board far to short (it only goes to 39 and we all had a 40+ score at the end). 

Immediately we played with hidden characters and a hidden draft, contrary to the rules, but I felt the game needed a little something to give it more interaction than we present. It worked quite well.

Rated it 7 as a children's game. Played as a 2p adult game, it was fun enough, very light optimal scoring choices. Fairly random for what it is. Very good for younger players, children well below 8 could handle this. Nice graphic design, language free but children would really need to use a full version of the rules. That is, we played a german edition with a text file for the rules. Children would need the English rules or a full PDF print out.

The title is wrong. It should be: destroy his planet! Game itself is ok but it is sooooooo far from the novel. The book is about journey, friendship and taking care of others. The game is about ruining what other players are trying to build. Lots of negative and brutal interaction in game for kids and families. Why?

Simple tile-drafting game that is possibly best with just 2. With 4 or 5 players going last (or even worse, late) can be disastrous through no fault of your own and downtime can become a problem. With 2, though, it's a nicely short affair with a bit of bluffing for added goodness.

I like the game, is more cut-throat than you expect for the art. It is not a kid game but you can play it, relaxed, with your family.

My husband and I enjoy The Little Prince: Make Me a Planet. The 2-player mechanism for choosing tiles adds an extra level of fun as we try to get the other player to choose the tiles we don't want. The rules are simple, but the decisions can be complex. 

The tiles are large and thick, making them easy for the man's giant fingers to pick up. The completed planets, predominantly blue and white, look very pretty on the table. Setup is fast. The overall footprint of the game is relatively small, enabling us to play it in our tiny travel trailer. 

We like this game a lot. We don't know anything about the book that supplies the theme, but now we are intrigued to read it.

Lapokból egy 4x4-es bolygót kell összeállítanunk. Négy rész a bogyó közepe, 8 pedig a bolygó széle. Ezen a 12 lapkán vannak különféle tárgyak a Kis herceg meséből (lámpák, róka, elefánt, bárányok, rózsák stb.) A négy sarok rész pedig, ezeket a tárgyakat pontozza különböző módon. Minden körben más a kezdő és mindig választ az egyik lapka csoport közül. Amikor kész mindenki bolygója, lepontozzuk azokat.

A simple set collection game with familiar theme. The Little Prince is a game to make a harmonious planet of your own. There are several characters to determine how much total point the players get. Each players choose 4 characters through out the game. With the 4 characters, players make their planet with other things, such as volcanoes, animals, boxes, trees, stars, and etc. The Little Prince is a typical set collection game. The game progress is quite smooth with easy rules. However, the game is so easily decided by tile luck. It is a good choice for someone who really like the novel, The Little Prince.

Seems like it should be a fun little light game, but it can be susceptible to gamers overthinking things and turning it into more than it should be.  From that perspective, figuring out which tile to take is actually easier than figuring out who should go next.  Which, you know, gives it the potential to get political.  Man, that all makes it sound like I should hate it, but it was fine.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (October 2013)

I expected way more from Bauza. This is a “cute” game with way too much luck, all the decisions are pretty obvious, there are not interesting decisions. The Baobab tiles are very easy to sabotage, so if you win via the gardener is mostly due to luck. I don’t enjoy it but I think the game mechanic is interesting. I would play again with two players to see the bluff variant. Fortunately the game takes a very short time to play. The game components are ok as is the game art.

Perhaps it is great to play with small children or with non-players. For me it is very boring. I could be wrong (it was a long time since I read the book) but I think the game theme is disconnected from the book. 

Bottom line, too much luck. I won´t ever consider to buy this game and I will do my best to stay away from it.

The Little Prince is a lot of fun.  Drafting is a mechanic that's fairly new to me and it works really well in this game.  I like that players who go last get to go first and so get to make the first decision on the next turn.  Volcanoes suck, but otherwise this is a really well done and enjoyable game.

The core of the game is simple: you need to choose 16 tiles. 4 of them depict what items, depicted on the remaining 12 tiles, will score points for you at the end of the game. The problem is that the order of play is determined by the players: that is, everyone chooses, who goes after them. The result of this is that your result depends not only on you, on the luck of the tile draw but also on the other players. However the game is not long, so it is suitable for easy start or end of the game day. Moreover, the literature related theme is really welcome.

Žaidimo esmė paprasta: per žaidimą reikia pasirinkti 16 kortelių. 4 iš jų nurodo, už kokius dalykus, esančius likusiose 12 kortelių, tu gausi taškų žaidimo pabaigoje. Problema ta, kad žaidėjų tvarką nustato kiti žaidėjai: tai yra, kiekvienas pasirenka, kas eis po jo. Taip gaunasi, kad kaip tau seksis priklauso ne tik nuo tavęs, nuo atsitiktinai atsirandančių kortelių, bet ir nuo kitų žaidėjų. Bet žaidimas netrunka ilgai, taigi tinka lengvai žaidimų vakaro pradžiai arba pabaigai. Be to, sąsajos su literatūra taip pat yra sveikintinas dalykas.

RATING: 8
This is my wife's favourite game. It plays 2-4 but I think it's better at two players because the tile drafting method is better. The first player sets out three tiles, two face up and one face down (which that player has looked at), and the second player has to draft one, either taking one of the two they can see or gambling on the one they can't see. The first player then takes whichever tile they prefer from the remaining two, and the other tile is discarded. In a four- (and I guess three-) player game, all four/three tiles are laid face up, the person who went last in the previous round drafts first, then nominates the next person to draft. Now that we have Kingdomino with its great four-person drafting mechanism, the Little Prince version seems a bit clumsy in comparison. 

Anyway, in the game you create a 4x4 planet and how your planet scores depends on the four characters you have at the corners of your planet, which you also draft throughout the game. So sometimes you're drafting based on the characters you already have, and other times you might be drafting based on the characters you hope to get later in the game. It plays very quickly and smoothly and is a great, light little filler.

Charming execution of a very charming theme. Game is pretty, but the looks unfortunately hinder the usability a bit as you really need to be up to date on what other players want. It is also a bit too AP heavy for what it is worth. This is unfortunately partially connected to the very fluid and smart drafting order system. My biggest gripe is, however, the players' complete inability to avoid killer tiles which can be very swingy in the end of the game. In my sole playing I ended up at 36 points while losing 22 points with the last tile that I wasn't able to avoid.

A témája nagyon sokat dob a hangulatán. A lapkák minősége elmegy, semmi extra, a rajzok szépek, stílusosak. A lapokon a kék háttér árnyalata nem egységes. Nem zavaró, de mégis furcsa. A szabályok rendkívül egyszerűek, de még a két fős változatban is van annyi taktikázási lehetőség, ami érdekessé teszi a játékot. A játékidő rövid, ami által lehetőség van egymás után több parti lejátszására is. Valószínűleg bármikor szívesen játszanék vele, de túlzott mélységei nincsenek a játéknak, viszont hangulatilag, és látványilag kiemelkedő.

A very simple card (tile) game using the illustrations of Exupéry's book - but the game captures not only the spirit and illustrations, but also some of the morals of the game (I guess you needed French designers to make it work like this). Because… You could say the “making of a planet” is nothing else but collecting 4 sets of different card types. It is true; there is no real spatial aspect to the game; mechanism-wise it’s not even tile-laying. It’s the childish fun of creation that makes “planet making” fun (and, well, a game) while it’s (mostly) the “grown-ups” that measure the beauty you have built by numbers in this game. Adults measure the beauty of your planet, but you still like the creation (maybe because it’s the time you spent on creating your planet that makes your planet beautiful).

Nice family game based on the Little Prince. The game balances itself by having the last player pick the next stack and get first choice. Some players may not like the negativity of always trying to avoid giving good tiles that benefit specific players. Biggest problem with the game will be the eventual kingmaking on the final set of tiles.

Liking this one a lot with the kids.  Offers some good point-optimization decisions while still remaining simple, and of course they enjoy the friendly art.  When played according to the rules it could get a bit nasty by sticking other players with a punishing tile and the potential for kingmaker situations is high.  To get around this we always play with 1 extra tile in each set (only works with 4 or fewer players) so the last player has at least two tiles to choose from, and we just do clock-wise turn order to keep it simple.

Simple but engaging.  Great art, easy rules, and as cutthroat as you care to make it.  Choosing turn order could leave some people out in the cold, but nice how you can go for different scoring ops, and being last to select gives you first choice next round.  Plays quickly, although I imagine AP can hit hard here.

Charming little tile placement game with a brutal twist.  Players take a tile and then choose who will take a tile next (of the remaining players in that round). This simple mechanic really makes the game as you can really screw over your opponents by conspiring to make them take tiles that will make them lose points.

A játék hangulata remek, a bolygóépítés pedig látványos és szórakoztató. Egyszerű szabályok és játékmenet, azon kell csak gondolkodni, kit válasszunk következőnek, és igazából ebben rejlik az egész játék. Így viszont sajnos a parti végkimeneteléről dönthet a szimpátia, vagy egy kevésbé profi játékos nemodafigyelése. Mi 5-en játszottuk, és ez a tapasztalat, ami miatt kissé savanyú a szőlő.

Tile laying game from Bauza and Cathala where each player must construct a 16 tile planet. 

Each tile has a range of features on it and the 4 character tiles that are located in each corner and collected over the course of the game determine what a player will score points for. 

Really good, light gaming fun.

RATING: 8.65
One of the delightfully unexpected aspects of this game for me, given it's childlike and whimsical theme/artwork, is that is a little bit wicked. For some people that little bit of meanness means it's no fun. I grew up on SORRY and I can take it, and dish it out without qualms. BUT the meanness is there, it's integral to the game and so you should judge your audience carefully. If they are okay with SORRY or RISK or Monopoly then they will be fine.

Otherwise, this is a fast fun little tile-drafting and tile-laying game with some light tactics. The drafting mechanic is the main focus of the game and hate-drafting is a consideration—what you keep for yourself is as important as what you keep or give to your opponents. Thankfully whenever you go first or second in a round you can force those thorny decisions onto the next player.

Really nice game.  Has continued to grow on us after more plays.  Two player tile selection mechanic is simple, clever, and offers great opportunity for bluffing.  Unexpected.

Scoring is the most problematic - can swing up and down and a bit of work to figure out.  We're not an ultra-competitive bunch so generally leave it for the end rather than after each round - though the score tracker on the back of the bottom box is nice (but insufficient to handle the scores as we regularly exceed 40 points).

RATING: 7
A simple game that hits the filler spot warmly. 16 rounds, each round you're going to turn over (# of players) tiles and take turns picking 1 each from those flipped. The first player chooses which of the 4 defined stacks the tiles will be flipped from, and scoring tiles make up only 1 of the 4 stacks. Each scoring tile offers a different way to score - stars, sheep, snakes, lampposts, etc - that can be found across all the tiles. And you'll accumulate 4 of these during the game, so it'll take a while before you know exactly what you're after. If scoring tiles are chosen early, then you know what tiles to collect from the other piles. If chosen later, then picking tiles in the meantime is more of a lottery. There are also tiles you want to avoid - too many trees and too many volcanoes could lose you points. While relatively light, it's an easy decision which tile to pick if one scores you a motza and the others don't. If they're much of a muchness, then assess what the other players want/need and deny them. That's the crux of the game across each of the 16 rounds. Easy to teach and play, great for a younger family but also pleasantly playable as a filler with gamers, so multiple niches are filled.

OMG! This gem beats out Fairy Tale for me!!! What a game this is!! Light, tile drafting, set collection game with The Little Prince theme and art, good for 2-5 players, and can play in less than 30 minutes. Instant Game Classic!! Bravo Antoine Bauza, Bruno Cathala, Ludonaute, and Antoine de Saint-Exupéry. Good 2-player!

The art and theme is nice and originates from the classic book, but IMHO you don't need to have read the book to enjoy the game.

Surprisingly deep. Because you don't start with goals, you need to prepare yourself for various possibilities and be alert to opportunity. We play with goal cards face-down, because it otherwise becomes all about extortion (I give you these so you can take that, because we can't let him have it). With goals hidden, there's still some of this, but it's interesting guess-work rather than deterministic calculation.

I was turned off by the art at first, but once the game got going I truly enjoyed it.

The characters in the corner make it so that you have to adapt your strategy to win, but the baobabs can mess you up if you're not careful (or if your opponents are smart enough when it comes to picking their cards, leaving you with no option).

My issue with this game is the turn order: the fact that it leaves it open for players to pick who goes next is a really bad idea. If you house-rule that, then the game becomes more balanced and, frankly, more fun.

This is a very mean 'take-that' style tile laying game, where the starting player chooses a pile, then puts out enough tiles from that pile for everyone. They pick first then they chose the next player to pick one, and so it goes with people picking a tile and then picking who picks next. Some times can cause you to take negative points. Others will go blank when you get too many. Each player has their own scoring criteria by the end, so most of this game is watching what's available vs what other players need and trying to make sure they don't get it. The little prince theme doesn't really work here, although I enjoy the art.

RATING: 7
Fond childhood memories of the book plus generally positive feelings about the designers (Bauza and Cathala) put this on my radar, and I was pleased to be able to pick up a German copy this month.

It's a very simple drafting game, with a neat twist. Each turn the start player turns over one tile per player and picks one of them. Then he chooses [i]who[/i] picks next. That player does the same, until all the tiles have been taken. Whoever got stuck with the last one gets to be start player next time. This means every round you have to consider who wants what and which ordering will stop them getting it!

There are 16 rounds of drafting: 12 of those are for the tiles that make up your planet and contain various items; 4 of them are for scoring objectives that give you points based on what's on your planet. The start player chooses whether to make scoring objectives or planet tiles available each round. There's an interesting timing choice here - do you take 'stuff' hoping to get matching objectives later, or vice versa.

Some of the items on tiles are negative too: if you get three baobab trees, all those tiles flip to their blank side; the player with the most volcanoes at the end of the game scores -1 for each. So of course part of the drafting is trying to push the negatives on to the players they hurt the most.

The scoring objectives are all represented by characters from the book with delightful thematic connections. The art is lovely too. It plays in half an hour. I've played with all player counts. 5p was too many, but the 2p version is great. The start player looks at three tiles secretly, then puts two face up and one face down. The other player can pick any of the three, then the active player gets one of the remaining two. So it adds a neat bluffing element with the face-down tile.

Best game of summer 2013 in my family. Easy rules, quick play, fantastic artwork. Good scalability for 2,3 and 4 players.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
My group calls this "The Little A**hole," as its theme and art totally hide the fact that this game can be really, really mean. Each turn you draft a tile for your planet and pass the rest to a player of your choice. That's really it. 4 of the tiles are scoring tiles that assign points based on the "Stuff" that appears on the other tiles. Tally points, most points wins. So where's the game? The game comes in selecting who you have the tiles to, and which ones, and who you put in the precarious position of needing to forgo a high-point tile purely to deny another player from getting more points. It's like Kingmaker Hot Potato. The second area is in how you manage who gets to select the next set of tiles, as whoever is handed a tile (i.e., whoever has no choice in what they draft since they choose last) gets to choose the next set of tiles and select first. This is also important. 

There are some other fairly standard things in there about diversifying before the fourth scoring tile gets distributed so you can keep your options open, but my goodness, that's in basically any tactical Eurogame since 2005. 

The only negative I can think of it is that the game can really slow down near the end as people math out what they're handing people. In a 5p game, you're going to sit there for a while. Play it quick and breezy and it's great.

I did not expect this to be quite so 'heavy', for a game based on a children's classic novel. Then again, why not challenge the brood here and then eh ? A good competitive puzzler with some limited interaction but a lovely theme and quick playing time. I am sure that some of the variants (2 player / bluffing etc.) add more spice to the stew. Kind of a galaxy trucker type puzzler without the real-time constraint.

RATING: 7
Over several rounds, players select one of a group of tiles (one per player) and add that to their personal tableau. All players will have a 4x4 "world" of tiles at the end, and will score (mostly positive but a few negative) points for features on their world.

The interesting mechanic here is after you take your turn, you choose who gets to go next. This can make for very mean play or, with kids especially, a lot of 'pick me' conversation. It is actually worse to be the next to last player to choose a tile, as the last player gets to be the first player in the next round.

Wow. I was warned that this was a nasty game, but I didn't expect it to be so much about destroying your opponents goals. There's a lot of mean moments where everyone will gang up on a player to give them that third tree, flipping their tiles over, or one last volcano, ensuring they get negative points. Eventually, players get so scared of having their plans ruined that they stop planning ahead at all, and saving their point scoring corner tiles for last. 

Overall, it is hard to balance the nasty with the good, but I'm still have fun with Little Prince.

For me the best of the light drafting games, or tableau building drafting games as: it's simple, yet there's interaction as well. (far better than 7 Wonders or Fairy Tale). Several interesting things – as any simple tableau building game it's about set collection, but you're not sure what will score you (as scoring tiles are also drafted). Interaction is all about screwing people over (selecting next in line to draft) – either to give them the third baobab or the second rose (it seems vulcanoes are more subtle and less targeted by others). The game gets better if the group playing it is more vicious and doesn't even blink for the 3rd baobab. Visuals are cute! 

But, I just find drafting boring and even in this version not interactive enough. Traded away even if I loved the art, so, that's telling. Goodbye fox. :)

Bauzára mindig oda kell figyelni, mert nagyon jó játékokat alkot. A Kis Herceg is a maga nemében nagyon jó kis társas. Mindenki egy saját kis bolygót épít különböző dolgokkal és 4 saját céllal. Ezek valamilyen dolgok megléte vagy nem megléte a kész bolygónkon, esetleg darabonként adott pontok, stb. Az építés úgy zajlik, hogy a kezdő játékos választ egy bolygórészt és ahány játékos van, annyit kitesz és választ belőlük egyet, majd továbbadja valakinek a maradékot, aki szintén választ és így tovább. Az utolsónak választó pedig kezdi a következő kört. Van benne szerencsefaktor, királycsinálás, de rettentő aranyos a téma és a rövid játékidő miatt abszolút belefér. Inkább gyerekjáték, de simán jó átvezető bárki számára nehezebb darabok között és bárkivel elővehető egy partira. Pontszámot itt máshogy kell értelmezni. Nem az én játékom és nem is az én típusom, de a maga nemében simán lehet ez a játék valakinél 7-es, 8-as is.

This is a drafting game, and not a spatial one or even tile-laying as you might think based on the title and components.  And the way the drafting is done adds a very interesting element to the game play.  Each round, the start player takes a tile and then chooses who will pick next, and so one.  The last player to choose goes first next round.  So you have to be alert to who needs what, and choose player order accordingly.

It has a weird VP track, which is on the bottom of the box.  But that's ok, we never use it as we just add up the points at the end anyway.  

Has a great 2P variant!

This is a pretty cool game, a whole lot meaner than the cute illustrations would lead you to believe! I like it, but it's likely too abstract for me, and also encourages more negotiation/table-talk than I'd prefer.

--- Summary ---
Players will be building a 4x4 planet, using 4 corner tiles, 4 center tiles, and 8 edge tiles. All tiles are in face-down stacks, sorted by type. The corner tiles are a variety of scoring tiles.

Each round, the start player draws n tiles from one of the stacks, keep one, and pass the rest to any player who repeats that process. The tiles have a variety of pictures on the front (baobabs, volcanoes, lamps, animals, characters, etc.). Add the tile to your world; if you now have 3 baobabs, flip those tiles over immediately. The last player chosen starts the next round.

The game ends after 16 rounds, when planets are complete. Score VP based on your corner tiles, which earn VP in various ways. For example:
- number of animal types
- number of lamps
- presence of roses (2 = 7 VP, 1 = 14 VP)
The player with the highest volcano count loses 1VP per volcano on their planet. Most VP wins!

The title and gameplay are definitely not your standard Euro, so I give it credit for being outside the box.  Lasts just about the right amount of time.  There are tons of better light, quick games out there, but I'd like to try it again.

This is a quick little tile drafting game.  Each round a player will draw tiles from one of 4 face down stacks, select one, and pass it to another player.  The last player to pick will be first the following round and so on until players have drawn all the tiles.  3 of the tiles are middle and two different facing edge pieces for a planet with a bunch of different symbols on them from volcanos to trees to animals.  The fourth type of tile are goal tiles that will give you different point amounts for the different types of symbols on your completed planet at the end of the game.

I think this is pretty good for a quick filler.  It's light, plays quickly, and is easy to teach.  However, the decisions in this game aren't always that interesting.  The one actually interesting decision is to either pick your goal tiles early so you know what you're after or to pick some planet tiles first in the hopes of setting yourself up for particular goals before your opponents can block you.  Once you do have goals out though the decisions are somewhat automatic, pick the tiles that help you the most and your opponents the least.  Sometimes you will need to make a decision that isn't super clear, especially if everyone doesn't have all 4 of their goals yet, and that's what attracts me to it at least a little bit.  In a small time slot I would usually be willing to play this.

Looks as cute as a barrel of puppies - however they are pit vipers in disguise. A game of trying to pass the nastiest tiles on to the person they hurt the most, vIa other players incentivised to also put the boot in who you hope will remember you not screwing them over on a previous round. It might actually be a nice kids game though as counter drafting is only learned in teen years I suspect its for the big gamer kids.

2 player it becomes a bluffing game, 'have I offered you the most points or not'.

RATING: 7
In a nasty strategy game, particularly a zero-sum game, hurting other players is merely the cost of doing business -- players are cute little Machiavellis plotting their manoeuvres and outmanoeuvres. But if a game [i]without[/i] strategy is a nasty one, well, it's the difference between ruthlessness and sadism. There's something so very unwholesome about casual cruelty.

The Little Prince carefully straddles this line. Amongst serious gamers it's likely to be a game of vicious hate-drafting: each round, a player turns up one tile per player, takes one, then chooses the player least likely to benefit from those tiles remaining to pick one next. Baobab trees -- which can cause tiles to flip over and become worthless -- are carefully directed to wherever they will do the most damage. It's a lot of fun.

Playing to win requires being as horrible as possible, and that's hardly anyone's fault. But there is so little control that I'm not entirely convinced that it's justifiable. Is there really more to it than the worst sort of "take that!" game? I can't quite decide, but for now I'm enjoying it.

Nice short drafting game where in addition to drafting something, you pick who drafts next, which can have a similar effect to hate drafting, but without you having to burn your own turn in order to do it.

Visually it becomes hard to decipher the current game state. Maybe that discourages over-thinking things.

I'm a little skeptical about the balance of goals (which are part of what you draft). The ones that give points for each animal seem both more reliable and more lucrative than some of the goals that half the time won't give you anything.

Component quality is ok, but a few of my tiles are effectively marked, if one were to care enough to try to memorize them.

Enjoyable, relatively quick, and easy to teach. Best with 2 players because of the concealed tile in this variant. Otherwise it tends to become an exercise in calculating maximal benefit/screwage, particularly if all the corner (personality) tiles are already out. Not that this is necessarily bad - it's just not as much fun.

Pretty fun and surprisingly mean tile-laying game. The first time the family played, my 10 year-old daughter won and loved it. We immediately played again and she lost and now hates the game. Getting to decide who takes the next tile is interesting, but you are definitely going to get a dirty look when you force someone to take that third tree.

Another Cathala game via Game Salute. I am not a huge fan of the publisher and a game of this type or quality selling for $25 plus is just too steep. While the art is nice and tiles are solid, I don't think the price matches what is available on the market for other games.

As for the game play, it is a cute game of tile drafting and set collection. The art is fabulous and matches very well with the story book. Players collect different tiles containing different elements for scoring and try to obtain as many positive points while avoiding negative scores. The unique aspect of this game is that the scoring is also drafted. So, your scoring options will only be revealed as the game progresses. This allows you to customize or select the scoring options that best fits your collection of tiles. 

The only thing I am on the fence is the drafting mechanism where one chooses the next player to draft. For a light and easy game, this step can be surprisingly jarring and mean-spirited for casual gamers. Not sure if there is a work around, but you can't exactly play this with kids (or adults) who are sensitive about being chosen last or not chosen by their spouse. It's worth exploring whether a tile drafting mechanism ala 7 wonders would work in this case.

The game is rather simple but it still presents loads of meaningful decisions.  The decisions aren't too meaty.  This is the perfect game to play with my partner.  Enough to keep me interesting without being too brain burny.  Also just the right amount of luck to even the playing field without being too frustrating.

This might be the only kids' game I know of where you're likely to hear someone yell "I will cut you!" when the right set of tiles hits the table.  Don't let the theme fool you; this is a cutthroat game of making sure no one gets the tiles they want, and the more players you have in the game, the better.  I see a lot of similarity between this and Nicht die Bohne!

I suppose I shouldn't be surprised that a children's book that features the titular character's suicide would be dark and mean, but holy crap. Good luck playing this with young or emotionally sensitive kids...Or grown-ups, for that matter. The primary mechanic is "Choose one thing for yourself and one wonderful thing for another player, thereby damning the other two players to a big box of sadness and tears. Nine times out of ten, that decision is a transparently aggressive one and if not, it's an obvious "I like you better than I like them." Yikes. Not for the feint of heart, for sure.

That being said, there is a surprisingly interesting game here. It's not terribly deep, but there is far more thought, luck pushing and politicking than you'd expect for a game based on a children's book. I an pleasantly surprised, although I think my younger kid's are a little too nice to play it as intended.

Medium theme application I guess? I haven't read the book sorry, so not sure how well the characters in the game match their literary equivalents.

What can I say - two of the greatest minds in contemporary game design, Antoine Bauza and Bruno Cathala collaborate to create a planet (not city!) building game based on Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's novella of the same name (nix the Make Me a Planet bit).

Super easy, overflowing with charm and relaxing to play. Another deceptively simple game that may surprisingly induce a little AP from players! Build a planet by drafting tiles, also draft characters from the story who will give you score depending on the objects scattered about your finished planet. Great as both a starter and a warm-down, but probably nicest as a warm down if a group doesn't end on something high like Resistance Avalon.

Nice little simple fast game similar to Mondo but in this case you chose a tile on turn and you decide who will be next and this mechanic adds a lot of interest to the game. Moreover, you also chose the tiles that decides how you will score points. Very interesting!

Quite a fun little game. I like the twist on someone making the first pick of tiles and then passing the rest to the player of their choosing. Neat combination of character tiles (who have scoring goals on them) as well as planet pieces and corner pieces. The changing nature of the scoring strategies (trees, suns, combos, etc) was cool. Some good decisions.

I did feel that this was a game where you can kind of "kingmake" people or punish them disproportionately, but it's light enough to not take too personally =)

A nice surprise.

RATING: 7.2
The rules for this game are very simple. There are four different kinds of tiles. Each kind has his own stack. The number of tiles in it, depends on the number of players. The starting player, draw as many tiles as there are players. He keeps on, and then places the left-over tiles open on the table. He picks the next player, who then picks a tile, and so on. Everybody places his chosen tile on the right spot in the planet. The player who picked the last tile, becomes the starting player for the next round.

A player can score points by placing characters (which are in the fourth stack of tiles). For example a player scores points for every brown sheep on his planet, or for every lantern, every species of animals. Some characters have an overlap, other characters contradict. Characters are chosen the same way as the planet tiles.

When a player places his third Baobab-tree on the planet, all the three tiles with a Baobab-tree on it, are turned face down. On the backside of the tiles is nothing, so a player doesn’t score for those tiles. The player who has placed the most volcanoes on his planet, counts his volcanoes and subtract that amount from his final score. The player with the most points win the game.

When I first read a review about this game, I immediately became interested in it. It sounded elegance to me and just enough tactics in it, to make it a fun game to play in between of something. After playing it a couple of times, I was proved right. Although it is very simple, and it looks a bit childish, it’s a nice and fun game to play in something about 15 minutes.

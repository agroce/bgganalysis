A good, solid Knizia game.  Needs a few more plays for an end rating, but I think it's fairly underrated and has interesting mechanics that I like.  Pay points to buy stock is really smart and this game requires some thought to it.  I screwed up a few things that cost me the game first time through.

Tough game to rate because it is highly dependent on what type of people you play with.  When I played with my kids, they just had no idea of stocks so it kind of bombed.  When I played with two other adults they loved it - playing 4 straight games.  There definitely is some luck involved with the card distribution, but the strategy is definitely present.

One of the ugliest games I have ever seen. Normally I wouldn't have bought it, even for the 2 euros I've paid, but now I must admit. The game is worth every cent.

The re-issue of Palmyra as Buy Low, Sell High has improved my opinion of game; even though Palmyra had a nicer look in my opinion, the game system gets a lot more traction on the stock market theme, which makes By Low/Sell High seem more coherent while Palmyra seemed abstract. I like this is a nice, low-complexity but still interesting game to play with casual gamers. The new version is over-produced, though.

I want to like this game.  The Uberplay Motley Fool edition is beautiful.  I can see why they reprinted this game, due to the corporate tie-in.  The gameplay for a serious gamer is rather eh, in my opinion.  You have little control.  Of course, it's a stock market game.  But if I wanted to do something with little control, I would actually play the stock market, not this game.  Lack of control is not good for a game.  It also suffers from Modern Art/Tigris & Euphrates rotation syndrome, which occurs when one player finds himself with little control because he always goes last in any given round.  Since the game doesn't require equal number of turns to determine the end of the game, somebody gets an advantage from seat position.  Personally, not a favorite from herr Knizia.

Quick, engrossing, frustrating game (5 plays so far). I rate it higher--want to play it more--because it is so quick.  It's frustrating in that any key element upon which I pin my hopes can suddenly be removed, and I'm helpless to do anything about it. Opponents' card play, card luck, turn order are forms of helplessness. So what I need to do, I think, is focus more on strategy than tactics (although "strategy" may be to grand a word for this short game). The only way I can see this happening right now is by strategic divesting, probably in the 2nd year.  Maybe I just have the wrong attitude. I want to play more and see if more experience helps.

RATING: 5
I own the Motley's Fool version of Buy Low, Sell High. It probably deserves a higher ranking that what I've given, but I just do not grok this game strategy yet, and that keeps me from enjoying myself as much. I mean, I really stink. I need to sit down sometime and meditate on the forces at work in this game until I sort it out.

One obnoxious thing about the Motley Fool version is the pawns. They are odd colors and we were constantly forgetting who was which. I don't know why this seems to be such a problem in this game, but it is. That, and you are constantly manipulating your money count as you buy and sell stocks each turn, so all the pawns are in frequent motion.  The rest of the components are quite nice...the board, the cards and the stock tokens. I just want nicer pawns and some type of marker to place in front of each person to remind us who is which.

This feels less "Knizia" than a lot of his stuff. I kept waiting for the special scoring for set collection, or variable game ending or something. True, you can hasten the game end, or delay it, by playing a "news" card or a "fee" card, but for the most part there is no sudden end to the year. 

The game is the right length. There is more here than meets the eye, in terms of optimal play. I'm not all the sure how much "fun" I was having, but the decision-making is pretty engaging. The shaping of the hand, and suckering and bluffing a bit is pretty fun. I'm looking forward to some more plays and hopefully improving my play. 

Next time I play, I'm employing a new strategy: buy low and sell high.

RATING: 6
This is a quick easy to learn trading and stock manipulation game. You don&#039;t actually own any stocks but you do own goods which you raise and lower the price through buying and selling as well as through cards. A good game but not great by any stretch of the imagination. Traded this game and Forum Romanum which I had a second copy of for high society, dragon&#039;s gold and rosenkonig.

Components: Überplay edition. Simple, funny, functional artwork. Identifiable stock icons. Overall, though, the game looks very plain. I think I'd prefer the Palmyra edition.

Experience: Interesting build-up of tension. The stocks don't fluctuate too much, so players just try to make a couple bucks here, a couple there in shrewd buys and sells.

Interesting stock board game. Reminds me of Stock Ticket, but with a little more meat.

You buy and sell a lot during the game. Luck of the draw can be a factor. Plays rather fast. Quite enjoyable if you enjoy the mechanics. Buy Low Sell High can be fun for non-gamers.

At first view, not sure what is best when it's your turn to play. Different possibilities are available during your turn. I would need to play it a second time.

I heard that there are various versions of this game available. Not sure if there is a major difference between them.

There are some compelling parts to this title. First, the concept that stocks will increase value if purchased and decrease value if sold is done very elegantly.

The Uberplay edition is nice, but it feels strangely over-produced.  The plastic stocks are neat, but the gameboard seems to have so much space with very little going on.  I guess I really shouldn't complain about it as the production quality is nice.  The game is fun, but it's a little mathy. It's okay, but it's not too exciting.  It certainly could have fit into a much smaller box.  It does play quickly so it does have that going for it.  It's worth picking up on the cheap, and there are plenty of cheap copies around thanks to Tanga.

[Initial Impression: 8]
Very quick-playing stock market simulation. Each player starts with one share in each of 3 stocks - technology, oil, and retail.  The stock types vary in their volatility and likelihood of paying dividends.  Players decide on each turn whether to buy or sell stocks, and can concentrate in a single stock or diversify across all three.  But...this stock market is highly subject to manipulation.  After trading, each player must play a card that affects one of the stock types.  You'll make decisions based on your cards in hand, and also on what other people seem to be buying, selling, and affecting with their cards.  There are wild swings in your money as you buy and sell. Trading a lot will lead to small gains, but can really hurt you in the end, as you don't have a chance to take advantage of the upward and downward movements at the end of each trading year.  Much of the game is simply trying to react to opponent's choices and not getting nailed by groupthink - hold onto cards that affect a stock everyone else is buying or selling and then play them late in a turn to drive that stock in the opposite direction.

Man, this game gets the short end of the stick around here.  Not sure why either, I thought it was an ingenious little gem.  The rules aren't that difficult to get through and it plays in a very short amount of time.  It's got oodles of interesting decisions and lots of player interaction.  Seriously, what more could you ask for?

Some people will say it's dry, but to me I get a bit of the feel of a stock market mogul.  I really enjoy the incomplete information everyone gets from the cards, and how it almost has a "Liar's Dice" feel of only knowing part of the picture.

And on top of all of that, it plays in well under an hour, and isn't fiddly at all.  Give it a go while it's dirt cheap!

I wasn't impressed with this game. It didn't seem to have but 1 dimension. It comes down to a follow the leader strategy, whereby everyone is forced to group together behind 1 or 2 stocks for mutual protection, while the other 1 or 2 stocks at best languish and usually get pummeled.

A Stock Market game... Knizia style.

Only having seen and played the Uberplay version, I'm not sure what changes were made from the original, however the game plays quickly and has enough strategy to keep you coming back for "one more try."

The Tax cards are the designer's way to keep one player from grabbing too many of one type of stock.  Some consider the card too powerful, I find it a nice balancing mechanism.

A solid stock market game that I attempt to get on the table regularly.

Some people say there is not enough control in the game, to which I respond " I don't have a lot of control over the stock market either". Therefore, when explaining the game I tell people that the cards they have in hand are the rumors they have heard regarding the market. While a card that has been played is what is actually happening. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I don't necessarily dislike the mechanics in this game, it's just the that there isn't enough time or variety for them to develop into anything interesting. The game is played over 3 scoring rounds ("Trading Years") and you get maybe 3 or 4 turns in each round. You are basically trying to guess what the "market" will be doing, and the market is influenced by the cards that are played at the end of each turn. Like I said, the mechanics are not bad for a light stock game, but the short length means that any fun you might have with a fluctuating and manipulated market does not have time to surface within the game's turn structure and timing mechanic. I'm also tempted to knock the game a point because the box is way too big for what the game offers. However, I haven't. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This has some interesting elements. There are three stocks which you can buy and sell. Then you play cards that will change the market at the end if the round. The game only lasts three rounds. You sell off all you stocks after the final round. There is some luck of the card draw that drives your market decisions. There is also some screw with your neighbor's market. The highest price for each stock seems to have too low a cap limiting the price growth. Overall the game seems a little too unpredictable for my taste.

A light stock market game.

RATING: 7
This is pretty light. I'm not sure there is much to it in terms of strategy. You have a little bit of influence over what you buy and sell, but the card play is chaotic and prices fluctuate a lot between your turns. I think a contrarian strategy is what keeps you in the game. Remember that this is a transaction game and not an investment game. The game is called Buy Low Sell High, not Buy and Hold. As I've figured that out, this game has grown on me.

RATING: 5
I feel some of the same frustration when playing this as I do with Dorra's Banque Fatale.  In theory, the game sounds really good, with a volatile stock market-type commodity exchange.  However I found it very difficult to manipulate the prices, as anything you plan can be very easily undone by your opponents.  I suppose that I need to play some more to unravel the strategy.  The amphoras can be a little unstable but I don't experience much of a problem with them falling down.

Traded away Palmyra version, reacquired Motley Fool version for cheap.

Surprised by this game.  Had lower than usual expectations but the game is by knizia, so you know there has to be something good about it.
Play moves quickly as you have limited options each turn.  The end game of selling off all your stocks one-by-one is an interesting twist.  Some of the cards picked up seem a lot more powerful than others, so I would imagine that card luck can play a big factor in who wins.

Very simple stock market game. Quick and very easy to understand. 

Just about the right length to work as an extended filler, 4 new plays is well under an hour - 2 players something like half an hour.

Not amazing but worth playing and once people know how it plays i can imagine it will become somewhat more interesting.

My only plays thus far have been with my family (including my four year old son who basically played a random card each turn) so I really haven't had the full experience of playing this against competitive gamers.  I am giving my initial impressions though as I was able to get a sense of the gameplay from the experience and I feel that this is a very nice, although somewhat dry, Euro.  The choices are significant and I could see some room for a variety of different strategic approaches depending on the cards in your hand and the actions of other players.

Despite the bright colors, cartoony cards, and pretty pieces, this just did not grab me.  I don't like stock-themed games (I'm pretty sure the 8th level of hell is an Acquire tournament).  Everything about BLSH seems to be in perfect working order, it's just not fun for me.  Hubby and friends didn't like it much either, though no one could identify exactly what it was lacking.  As my husband says, "It's bone-dry," but it's a stock-trading game, so we knew that going in.  Maybe there's just too much guesswork involved, predicting the value of certain stocks even as all the players are working at changing those values.  I guess that makes it realistic, just irritating to play.

Primer juego entre dos y un segundo juego con 5. Entretenido, si ser espectacular. Es muuuy rápido, por lo que es perfectamente un juego de relleno.
Se trata de un juego que imita la Bolsa de comercio; se compran y venden acciones de tres empresas (cada una con volatibilidad distinta), y se juegan cartas que aumentan o bajan su precio.
Gana quien tenga más dinero al final del mismo.
UPDATE: down it to 6.

Weird-feeling buying/selling game. Felt kinda like a less polished Modern Art -- players buy stuff without complete information of their eventual worth, but the act of buying/selling actually influences the going price... Need to plan ahead a turn or two, but it seemed in some cases almost impossible to predict what other players would do, leading to a chaotic feeling to the game. I'd like to play again and see if it changes my rating.

I like the concept of stock market games, so I was seduced by this title.  In retrospect, I should have gone for [b][GameID=2651][/b] or any other number of better market games, as this was terrible!  Granted, I only ever played it as a two-player, but I couldn't see this being enjoyable with any number of players.  You buy tech until it's too high, then you sell tech and buy something else.  You buy that until it gets too high, then you sell it and buy something else.  Rinse, repeat, rinse, repeat until the game ends.  Sure, there are some special market cards that mess with the basic gameplay, but this is essentially the game.  Couldn't get rid of it fast enough.

The endgame selloff can be deadly, and that's one of the factors that gradually lowered the rating after repeat plays. With only 3 or 4 trades in a turn, and three other people playing cards aimed at disadvantaging you, you also need to be careful with your investments not to stray to extremes in position taking. Traded away in the end.

Great little stock market game made even better with the Uberplay edition. The components are top notch and the game play has changed just a bit from Palmyra. Fun to play and fairly easy to teach to non-gamers. The timing seems just perfect as you want to play just another turn every game. One of Knizia's better designs. This is not a deep stock trading game and offers no opportunities for long term planning but it doesn't pretend to be that; it is good for what it was intended. For a deep (probably the best) stock market game play Shark.

This one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract. In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility. Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher dividends, and retail falls in the middle.

Not sure what to think of this one yet. Maybe in taking the variability of the stock-types into account a little more would help. I'll have to try a third time to determine if this is something I'd play in addition to or instead of Get the Goods.

"Buy low" is better than Palmyra in every aspect... Nice stock market game with a kind of extended "Flinke Pinke"-feeling. More influence and tactics with 2, more "realism" (chaos) with more players. Pity, that Uberplay went out of business: if you can get a copy of this game, hurry up!

Teaches the concept of supply and demand.  It does require a little bit of different thinking about when to buy and sell, and how long will that sell price last.  Wouldn't mind playing it a few more times, but I doubt that I'll want to play it for long.  Traded one copy for Hellas

RATING: 5
The game seems pretty light, but when you try to play it well you discover it is more deep that you first imagined.  It is hard to get the best option to buy or sell every time, and some people could take time to play while doing all the calculations.  Luck can give a hand here, specially when you are set to sell first at the end, or when you begin a year.

[August 2006, SF-Sale]
Holds some level of interest, although, as I played, I didn't really feel like I could form any cohesive strategy. Initial rating a 6. The components themselves are very nice. Gameplay is a little flat.

RATING: 7
Another good commodities game. The components are really nice. This makes a good re-implementation for Palmyra.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
What am I missing here?  I felt that there were a small number of choices to make each turn where one was the best choice and the other choices were subsequently worse.  This meant that my choice was to always pick the better option.  As a result the game feels dictated by the luck of the draw and ultimately what everything is valued at.  The turn order feels almost broken.  Getting a turn at the beginning of a new round is just so remarkably powerful compared to people starting later that the game feels pointless.  When there is an oportunity to sell high you take it.  I felt that the game was playing me and I was just toolin' around seeing where it goes.  

It makes me appreciate how well the market works in McMulti.  This game had 20 years to learn from it, but didn't bother.  Now it is wrapped up neatly in a crappy co-opted advertisement.

There is no drama. No excitement.  The fact that the game is this granular eliminates any substantial surprising swing.  It all feels like it is on the rails, traveling in slow motion.  This game commits the worst offense, it is boring.

This is the type of game I enjoy, commodity purchasing and speculation.  Seems most games I put too much money into one commodity and end up losing my shirt, but sometimes I pull it out.  Good Knizia game.

Stock trading game.  The board is nice, but the stocks are cheap plastic.  The decisions are pretty straightforward, and there's no really cool mechanic here that makes me really want to play this.

RATING: 8
very simple auction game with lots of math!  The game plays easily in 45 minutes to 1 hour.

This is a good, solid Knizia game.  Like many of his games, we were a little luke-warm on the game the first couple plays, but by the 3rd it really took off for us.  So many of Knizia's "distilled mechanics" games are like this, with the true fun at first obscured by what appears to be overly simplistic gameplay.  If the game seems overly simplistic, play it a few more time, preferably back-to-back, and the subtleties of manipulating the relative stock-values will really start to become apparent.

RATING: 4
[Uberplay 'Buy Low Sell High' edition] {Stock; commodity speculation; optimal 2p} It's an ok filler: fast paced with some tactical options. It can be a good 2p game but it becomes slightly chaotic with 3/4 players. It's more a tactical game because it's difficult to formulate a good strategy because of the card draw. I think the game is too short for 4p as well; a player hasn't much control on the market.

The design of the stock market is too artificial even though the nature of commodities is quite similar to the real commodities. It's fun to play but it brings little knowledge for players in real-life stock market.

The game is heavily over-produced! The box is awfully LARGE. It'd be much better if it can be stored more easily. (Will the publisher ever consider a travel edition?)

This game wasn't too bad, it was a tight game, and on my first play I think I made a few mistakes about when to sell and when to buy.  In the end, Since you start with about 95 dollars or so in net worth (in stocks and cash) I think I just barely made a profit.

The winner only had about 115 or so, so I think making one or two dollars for sure is the better way to go, and not fully investing in one company unless you are sure you can push them up, and sell the stock, before other people destroy the value.

RATING: 6
Not Knizia's best. Despite the endorsement by Motley Fool, the game isn't about stock investing, but stock market manipulation. As such, the modern look of the game is kind of jarring. It should look pre-1929.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It seems that the stocks start out too high. Everyone is trying to drive down some stock in the first round so they can buy in to it. Someone buying in to it is trying to drive it up. The stock probably doesn't go anywhere and the buying prices are in the teens. On a case that no one is fighting for one type (or 1v3), then one stock can move up to a point where all the stocks are sitting on 30 and people will only sell. At this point the stock is pretty much out for the rest of the game.

Fun game, but I never really felt like my planning was working.  Also, since there are so few cards played, it seemed difficult to prevent wild swings in the commodity pricing.

Definition of 5 is "average game" and "slightly boring".  That seems to really fit this one quite well. I wanted this to be more fun, really did but it just doesn't deliver on that.  It's not horrible and it's easy to teach/learn and really could fit the gateway game category quite well.   For me to have fun with it I would need there to be a bit more to it though.

Despite the lame theme and art, there is actually a pretty strong game here (especially surprising since the market is so flooded with these games that people almost pay you to take them).  The cards can make things a bit swingy, but as far as light stock market games go this is actually pretty good.

Motley Fool version, 4 people.  Not a fan of stockmarket games in general, but I was expecting more tension and tough decisions from Knizia than this delivered.  However, I wonder if we played this with the right rules and/or approach?  By end of second year, all stocks were at their maximum.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fun economic game.  The mechanics are simple.  You buy stocks which increment in price as you buy and decrement in price as you sell.  You then manipulate the stock prices with cards which tend to take effect at the end of a "year".  You play 3 years, he with the most money wins.  Of course it pays to remember which year your on which I apparently can't do :).  All in all a fun, quick, light game which I enjoyed playing.

terribly simple stock market game, it really has just 2 or 3 rules and this is why it is so great! it is straightforward to understand what is influencing the market and u can just enjoy the process of exploiting it. it feels so much better than more convoluted games where ur action influences the market only very indirectly. it is a great game for everyone, immediately explained and enjoyed. I think it is very very underrated.

There's not enough going on in this game. You can buy or sell stocks at the start of your turn, then play a card which will affect their price at the end of the round. When it's not your turn, hope your opponents oblige you by helping increase the value of your stocks. All fairly boring. 

I like the idea of the three industries having different market volatilities, but it seems like you'd need multiple plays to notice the effect on the game.

Nothing to write home about... Too easy to get hit in the crossfire when someone is trying to target another player. Felt I had very little chance to maximize cards drawn with stocks to pursue... Felt that there was a HUUUUGE advantage to being first to act in the 2nd or 3rd season, but having no such restriction as in the beginning of the game to only get 1 action when acting first. The opportunity to cash out 2 stocks before anyone else is enormous, unbalancingly so.

An interesting game of market manipulation with excellent production values. The problem is that the game is, as I said, interesting - but not particularly fun or engaging.

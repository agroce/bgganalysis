GAME: Undermining
RANK: 2650

RATING: 8
Undermining is a fast and fun pick-up-and-deliver game.  Set, of course, in my favorite theme: Space!  Players take turns drilling for minerals underground in order to fulfill contracts in return for Starbucks (no pun intended?)  It almost seems like a filler game, but it satisfies more than one.

A fun game worth playing every once in a while but more medium to lightweight. You mine a planet for resources in order to fulfill contracts for points and to upgrade your mining vehicle so that it can out perform other players mining vehicles. The game moves on a action point allowance mechanism and is visually appealing. I hear it is like the video game, "dig dug" in a box.

I believe this game is simply too short.  If you go after extra actions or cargo holds and anyone else concentrates only on victory points the good ones will be gone and game over before you have a chance.  I am tempted to say it's broken and give it a 1 but I will be nice.

Had just one 2-player game to teach ourselves.  It's fairly easy to learn, and the board/pieces are nice (except for the flimsy cards, as stated by others already).  My b/f and I thought it was fine...I think we're too obsessed with other games in our collection to give this the attention it deserves, though.

Too, I'm thinking the space theme just isn't my cuppa (see my Eclipse and Alien Frontiers ratings).

*UPDATE* Somewhat uneven trade for the expansion of Navegador, but it was just a $20 game - and what's trading for anyway, except for getting things you value in exchange for something you don't much want?!

First Play: great build quality and a neat design. Short and sweet with some limited opportunity for screwage, the game has a neat mechanic until the randomness of the alien artefacts are introduced. These offer potentially dramatic benefits that can grant enormous advantage that snowball to result in exaggerated winning margins.

Not a game I'd buy nor rush to play again.

A bit disappointed. This looked very nice, but turned out to be much lighter and much faster than I thought. There seemed to be very little value in going for the upgrades. The guy who didn't upgrade and took the first few points instead won. Might be better with fewer (we played with 5).

Disappointment aside, this is a nice, light game with some clever aspects (though the rules could be a little bit clearer).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My initial excitement about this game was probably due to the "lots and lots of simple decisions culminating in a bigger strategy" favoritism. But now I'm seeing that many of those simple decisions end up being drudgery, and despite how quickly the turns play out, the rewarding actions are too few and far between.

A very cool game that's 50% pick-up and deliver, 25% blocking, 25% technology upgrading, and 100% retro video game! Instant classic, great for gamers and non-gamers alike. Warning: there's a little bit of set up time.

Pretty uninspired pick-up and deliver game where you drill the ground for gems which you use to either upgrade your mining vehicle or cash in for points.

Not much to it other than that, other than a terribly bad rule book.  The rules use all kinds of terms without explaining or showing anywhere what those terms mean.  Just really really poorly done, requiring a lot of deduction and guess work to figure the game out.

In the end, the game works fine once you figure it out, but isn't anything incredibly exciting.

RATING: 6.5
Undermining is easy to learn, plays in less than an hour, and is reasonably fun, even if none of the ideas are ground-breaking (groan!) or even new.  The production values are good and I especially like the design of the player boards.  However, there appear to be significant balance issues with this game.  For example, fulfilling contracts is the main scoring mechanism and the difficulty (or ease) of fulfilling a particular contract has nothing to do with its value.  The randomness of the contracts can make for some huge point swings at times, and it can be hard to catch up with a player who nabs two or more high-value contracts early on.  In addition, the scoring for upgrades seems too low, even when you take into account the advantages they provide in competing for contracts.  Still, an entertaining filler and worth playing.

Oh yes - the rulebook is amazing, only because it demonstrates that a shit rulebook can still be written, no matter how simple the gameplay might be.  Key ambiguities and omissions are addressed in the rules forum.

The mining vehicles are molded superbly, making them inviting to look at and pick up.

I'm in my 30s, haven't played with Matchbox cars since childhood, but I really enjoy moving these mining vehicles around, getting resources and upgrades. Doesn't matter who's winning, I find the actual manipulations reward enough!

The strategy level is perfect for me. There's a handful of upgrades to work toward, and/or victory point accumulation, and with the randomized game board, it's never clear what strategy is best.

A straight up action economy game with a mining theme on top. Some luck of the draw with the goal cards similar to another game (Super Motherload) but with a single board, less variability. Cool art, neat small drill machine plastic minis, but the replayability is suspect since the strategies will be the same each game.

Oddly similar to Hansa Teutonica

You can exchange the resources that you have mined either for victory points (star bucks) or for enhanced actions. However, because the victory points diminish with each exchange, it almost always makes since to go for the VPs first. That is, the choice seems more theoretical than real, at least early in the game. Unusual and nicely implemented theme, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You basically are moving your drill tank and gobbling up tokens, while the other players are doing the same thing.   It's a pretty simple concept and the game looks pretty good on the table.   The luck of the contract cards can be very swingy.   Not sure that I need to own it, but I'd play it a few more times.   5 players might be one too many.  3-4 players would make the drilling and gathering experience a little more satisfying.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This was a pleasant little causal game. Nothing amazing but a fun little action point game where you have a drilling vehicle that you dig resources out of the ground which you can bank for points or spend on upgrading your drill. It isn't a game that is underrated but sadly a game that will in the long run end up overlooked and forgotten. It is a beer and pretzels game that isn't based on combat and dice chucking which feels a bit rare. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great theme, nice components, solid if uninspired gameplay. The rule book is inadequate to explain several of the key gameplay aspects and we found this frustrating for such a simple little game. Luckily, the player aid card and official FAQ posted here on BGG are excellent and answered all of our questions.

I must admit I question a few of the design elements - like spending the majority of your actions simply moving to and from the refinery ad infinitum. Also, there's the layer of solid rock just below the surface. It's such a deterent in most games that I'm not sure what the point was, especially given all the portals on the board.   Did we need star bucks (victory dollars) associated with the upgrades?  Shouldn't buying the upgrades in lieu of contracting be reward enough? Finally, what's with the extra bays on UMV cards? Why not simply have the bays start blocked, as with the upper (upgrade) spaces on the UMV cards - the ones which are only removed and available in a 5 player game.  Instead, you start with the bays blocked, then once you upgrade to extra bays you get... more blocked bay tiles.  Huh? What am I missing?

The minerals themselves are never named or explained in the rules, leaving players guessing as to which one is "X-ium" etc. Sure, you'll eventually figure that one out based on the artwork, but it would still be nice to have a reference.  Ditto for the upgrades.  The extra bay upgrade, for example, is not explained in the rules.

Despite some odd design elements and numerous flaws with the rule book itself, the game is decent for such a quick contest, and the multiple paths to victory give it some depth and replayability. There is no way to stop a runaway leader, but with a game so short I'm not sure it really matters.  And that's one of the game's saving graces - it's so short that many of its would-be faults can be written off by simply trying a new approach in a new playing.

A relatively simple "pick-up and deliver" family game with cool mining tank components, and customizable player boards.  Each player's vehicle travels throughout the board picking up various types of gems and alien artifacts to use in either fulfilling contracts which are worth points, or to spend to upgrade their vehicles capabilities (speed, drill strength, storage capacity, or number of actions). I was decently impressed with this game, and know my boys would love it.

Largely this gets the low rating because I can't help but compare the game to Freya's Folly which I find is the much stronger design.  Undermining is hurt by being overly fiddly, too quick (feels like things end just when you are beginning-maybe a good thing), and lacks any real tactics or strategy.  Just go for the best combo of gems you can reach, and then return to base.  

Undermining feels a little half-baked.

I love pickup and deliver games, upgrades and action points, so I thought nothing could go wrong with this one. But somehow it fell flat. I like good family games but this one is perhaps a bit too simple. I'll stick to my other favorites in this genre - Finca, Bombay & Perry Rhodan.

Very nice looking game which is fast and easy to play. The components are very good (particularly the UMVs and the player mats) and it's easy to teach. The main problem is that the alien technologies are a bit overpowered. The key is to treat them like any other resource (this is, in order to use the technology you have to unload it first). Overall, it's a relaxing game with an interesting theme.

It is a fun quick game of mining for various resources. Doing upgrades also contributes to victory points, but the contracts give most of the victory points. They go from high to low, so you have to balance between getting high contracts early or getting valuable upgrades.

Meh. Interesting theme, strongly reminiscent of Total Recall, but other than that, it's nothing terribly special. There's something a little odd in a game where you distribute dozens of chips on a board and the rules just say "give everyone a handful and put them wherever." 

I didn't hate it, and it's quick and fun, but a little samey. Basically, you want to make your drilling trips as efficient as possible and you may or may not be able to do so, depending on turn order and alien tech draws. So?

RATING: 7.7
Despite its cover art, Undermining delivered a surprisingly compelling pickup-and-deliver. It's both simple and remarkably fun. Your vehicles are upgradable (speed, drilling, extra actions, etc.), but players need to balance buying upgrades against fulfilling contracts for victory points, and the longer you wait the less contracts are worth.

The play time is remarkably short. My first game probably took less than 30 minutes.

Undermining is a highly interactive game, with player actions sometimes benefiting and sometimes impacting the future actions of others. Competition for resources is important, of course, but using open tunnel spaces to get where you need to go—and blocking those spaces from opponents—is also key. Players can still move through other UMVees, but doing so costs battery power, and managing your batteries—which allow extra actions—is another important aspect of playing well.

Undermining comes with a double-sided game board, with player interaction being significantly different from one side to the other. With a random layout of resources, UMVee upgrades, contract variability, and one-off special bonuses from the finding of alien technology, no two games of Undermining are ever the same
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This fits the bill of a game that I'm fine playing but won't buy or seek out to play.  The UMVs are beautifully crafted and actually have some heft and the doublesided board is a nice touch as well!  There is some tension in the race of drilling gems and then deciding whether to trade those gems in for higher value contracts (VPs) or upgrade your UMV.

Fun, fast playing game about digging and depositing resources. An efficiency race game. Interestingly enough, the entire board and location of resources is revealed at the onset of the game.

A word on strategy: at higher player counts, getting upgrades early is crucial, and be on the lookout for alien tech "clumps" in the tiles. Letting a player mine two or more in a single turn is almost an auto-win for that player. Or consider spacing them out during setup.

There is actually a lot of meaningful decision making which means it's a strategic game, but thanks to the theme being light and gameplay being fun, it's never so tense that people get analysis paralysis or slow down the pace of the game. A great combination for a light game. Good for families but not a just a kiddie game. Great for strategic adults too.

The more I play this, the more I realize that despite the light theme and easy to learn rules, the depth of strategic possibilities is greater than many middle weight euro games and certainly most American style games. There's a lot of stretegy packed into this game.

The game actually has almost no luck. Who gets to go first and what alien tech card you get may have some effect, but it's almost a purely deterministic game meaning it's, in one sense very brutal and ruthless. WIth the light theme and casual mechanics, it never feels stressful or humiliating for playing more poorly than the other player though. Great game. SLIGHTLY long set up for a game this simple but worth it because of how diverse and interesting the board looks and plays when set up.

It's a 3 action per turn pick up and deliver game, where your actions essentially are to move, pick up or trade in. Trading in goods is always back at the same start place, which makes it a one-dimensional pick up and deliver game, and the pick ups are further and further away after the low hanging fruit is eaten first. You trade in your goods to either satisfy one-off contracts for points, or trade them in for upgrades to your vehicle - move an extra space every move, pick up 2 goods instead of 1 for an action, get an extra action each turn (mmmm), or get an extra cargo hold to carry more on each trip (which seems best given each hold saves you half a trip, and the trips get longer and longer as the game progresses). So the decision point is points now vs points later, usually based on how long the game feels like it has to go. The good thing about the game is that it flows fast. Once you've worked out what you want to go for next (after assessing what other people are collecting or about to collect, as the contracts are a race to get them first), it's just a matter of executing the actions without thinking too much. Where people are, and how much they'll block you, vs going for unblocked stuff further away is the other factor. The game is in that decision and that assessment, multiple times through the game, which may not be enough to engender a huge amount of replay but it is what it is - an efficiency race game with players collectively deciding where/when the finish line is (ie when one queue of contracts run out). It's not a game I'll probably ask for much given its limited decision making scope, but I won't mind playing it if it hits the table because I know it'll flow well and it'll be interesting enough.

This game feels a little like an old-school arcade game.  You're physically moving your piece around a grid, collecting gems, and returning them to base to get either points or equipment that will help you mine better.  There's some blocking, but it's not excessive.  Going earlier in the turn order seemed to be an advantage, but it may just be a function of the random board layout.  When describing this game, "pleasant" and "inoffensive" are words that come to mind.

Get it? It's a pun! Undermining, like not mining, but disrepecting people. I get it, you undermine your opponents to get contracts and minerals to up grade your mining machine. So who never wanted to be in control of their own mining machine, I ask thee. Coming from Wales where my garndfather used to mine for coal ,I thought my dreams have come true. The game is so simple, you mine, you move and deliver! Any more options would hurt my head. Oh wait there's Alien technology and the colours are bright, or dear Mr gaming designer, why oh why oh why! I had dreams of mining black coal and you make me mine different colourful gems. Oh why did you have to name your game such, now I must undermine you with my sarcasm. I love your game very much, so much I gave it away. With it, my life was too exciting, without it less so! In all honesty it is a fine game, in a world of great games!

Didn't make the cut as it was undermining the great quality of my games!

Great components.  Great theme.  Gameplay is pretty good.  The rule book - is just too vague.  Well maybe not vague, but it's kind of like someone's first explanation of the rules of a game without going into any of the finer details.  You'll need to read most of the Rules posts here on BGG to fully understand the complete rules.  

With that aside though, the game itself is very good, light fun that's playable within an hour.

I wish it had a little more interaction (drill each other?!) as even in a 4 player game, we rarely seemed to get in each other's way.

Pros:
* Scales well to 2p
* Lots of player interaction on the board
* The Alien Artifact cards are powerful and exciting

Neutral:
* It seems like this one would have a long setup time, but it's really not that bad.
* The game ends when a single stack of "star bucks" is depleted. Our first play felt like it ended suddenly just as things were picking up.

= 2017-03-26

Very much enjoyed my first play of this game. The game seems to scale down to 2 players very well by providing incentives for players to work in the same areas. Despite having a much larger board than we needed, we were still blocking each other and racing for the same locations throughout the entire game. It is rare for me to enjoy a pure pick-up-and-deliver game, but this one was good.

A very simple game that manages to demand quite a few important choices. The first few turns are key, choosing whether to take early upgrades for a head start on the late game rewards, or fulfilling the early high-point contracts.

Playtester. Undermining is a fun, quick-playing game where players control a mining vehicle, drilling underground tunnels to claim different types of resources. These resources can then be used to upgrade your vehicle in different ways or fulfill contracts for victory points. Some resources represent alien technologies that give you one-off special abilities.

There's plenty of interaction as you jostle for position underground, steal resources out from under each other's noses, and race to fulfill contracts. A great, family-friendly game that's engaging enough to satisfy core gamers and approachable enough to have broad appeal. I'm looking forward to seeing this one get picked up for publication.

Overall a bit boring.  There is a mild optimization problem to be solved when you first look at the board, but then you mostly just slog through it.  The game is short, but it still felt slow since it took multiple turns to make progress.

The game rules are simple and fast, although the rulebook is not completely clear.  The components are very nice.

The choice between upgrades and contracts is good.  The different upgrades, while extremely simple, do offer a mild optimization challenge on a first play.  But the answer is to buy generators + movement engines, then to crank out points.  Just do that every time.

If the game had provided another layer of strategy on top of the core digging mechanic, it could have been really strong.  As is, it feels like an engine looking for a game.

Undermining is a good, clean design that is pretty good on the time and enjoyment balance. Decisions felt rather straightforward, though not obvious. More could've been done with the alien techs in terms of variety and power. We also felt that contracts seemed to be worth going for more than the upgrades, but upgrading your UMV was more fun than grabbing contracts and counting up how to get them. What I learned from this game is that in pick-up-and-deliver, short distances where you have a chance to block are more interesting than long distances or a game without agressive blocking. Nice game, but not a gem.

A fresh theme and some neat mechanics make this a winner.  The only thing holding it back for me is replayability, it seems that the game would be a bit samey after a while.  But the idea of upgrading your drill and the variable setup and component quality makes it a blast to play.

RATING: 6
This is a game about controlling a drill in order to mine out resources and deliver them to fulfill contracts for points.

You can also mine out alien technology and spend your resources on upgrades to improve your drill's ability to move, store more resources, take more actions, or drill more spaces at a time.  This is a fine game and there is a fair bit of strategy with the multitude of options available but I think it has a lot of rough edges.

For one, I don't mind tight games, I often enjoy them actually as they add a lot of tension and weight to your decisions but every now and then the stringent barriers of a game really takes away from it.  That's how I feel about this game.  You start only being able to hold two resources and the whole game is on a very fast timer and contracts decrease in point value with each one fulfilled.  This all had me feeling like I could never really upgrade my drill (in fact only one player in 5 bought a single upgrade in my first game) and it's not the most fun to go out to drill up two resources and come back right away.

Second, the game has one way to interact with other players, you can block their path by placing your drill in their way forcing them to spend battery cubes (which could otherwise be used for extra actions) to move past you.  The problem is the default movement is 2 spaces so spending this energy to move past someone often doesn't accomplish a whole lot.  I got stuck in a cycle where I and an opponent wasted several turns blocking each other because we got stuck in a corridor and were spending our 3 actions each turn simply to get batteries and move in front of the other.  This invariably ruined our chances of winning the game since that was several actions wasted that weren't for the other 3 players at the table.  I simply think the way that mechanic is designed could use a little tweak to prevent this from happening.  For example, using the energy to move past a player should also count as the extra move action you could get with that energy anyway.

Finally, the alien tech cards are way too powerful.  This is especially bad for new players.  By the time I saw how powerful they were and realized I should have been getting as many as possible all the easily accessible ones were gone and I ended up not being able to get a single one.  They give insane abilities that really make the actual upgrades seem even more obsolete.

It really isn't a terrible game, there are a lot of options on each of your turns and it looks nice and can be entertaining.  I just think a few tweaks would have made it a much better game.

My wishlist comment said:

[q="srand"]Fell off radar a while back due to the "underwhelming" review, but some comments suggest it's the kind of thing I'd like -- tight game with spatial movement, blocking (e.g. ending turn on portal) and tradeoff between upgrading and contracts. Want to try.[/q]

It turns out that I do like a lot of elements of the game but in combination it does fall frustratingly short. Players drive their little vehicles out to mine crystals, which can be exchanged back at the refinery for upgrades (more movement, better drill, more cargo space, extra actions...) or to fulfill contracts (worth more VP than just hoarding the crystals).

Ultimately it's a race game, and like most such games is about the pivot from drilling for upgrades to drilling for points. Part of the problem is that you start the game moving so slowly and able to hold so little cargo that progress is a frustrating grind, but the game clock seems to want a pivot to contracts well before turns start to be satisfying.

I do wonder if there are hidden depths, though, or simple variants that would make things a little more dynamic (such as being able to destroy non-rock tiles if cargo is full, e.g. to clear a route to a portal). Rating reflects present desire to try it again.

Nice components, but pathetic that the rulebook is literally missing a page containing critical information.

When played 2 player, this is a nicely tactical game about blocking and positioning as well as deciding when to change from upgrading your UMV to going for contracts. A great filler.

As a 5 player game, it was a little bloated, over long and far too chaotic. A poor medium length game.

My rating is based on 2 plays as a 2 player game and one as a 5 player game. If I rated it solely as a 5 player game, it'd be somewhere in the 5-6 range.

Another game that seems to have divided opinion in our group. I rather like it, and I think it has a fair bit of strategic depth to it, but I don't think it's going to get an awful lot of table time. One annoying aspect is the terribly ambiguous rulebook. We've added a couple of house rules which I think really improve the game over it's "official" incarnation... though it's not easy to tell from the rules exactly what the official incarnation is!

Edit: I did get a bit tired of this after another game or two, and now it's been traded away anyhow.

This is a cute game that will probably appeal to non-gamers and folks who are looking for games to play with their families.  It has some confrontation, thanks to the game's race element, but the game is really a basic pick-up-and-deliver game with a simplified tech tree to help improve what you can do on your turns.  The incentives of how to use your collected resources -- for upgrades or points -- is simple but effective, and there's definitely a point in the game where you want to shift your focus from one to the other.  It won't replace other engine-building games like Race for the Galaxy, which do this in a more complex and better way, but it does a good job of making you think about your decisions.  The game has a lot of replayability, thanks to the double-sided board and the random seeding of resources each game, and it's certainly attractive, even though it does look almost identical to Eminent Domain as far as the fonts, layout, colors, and general design go.  It's inoffensive and fun, and short enough not to wear out its welcome.  The game seems to end just as players start to get going, but if it lasted much longer, it would probably wear out its welcome.

[color=red]BGG Secret Santa 2011 - THANKS![/color]

Very fun game that's easy to learn, quick to play, and has really great artwork and components.  It's quickly becoming one of my favorites.

There's a fair amount of strategy as everyone tries to find the right balance between upgrades and contracts, and as players jockey for position to get to the minerals they need most.   

This is definitely better with more players, but still very good with just two.

The more I play this the more I like it - rating bumped up to a full 9.


[-][color=gray][i]A very minor issue we've encountered a few times is that once a player gets one or two of the alien tech pieces, they can use those to quickly gain several more which becomes a big advantage.   A quick fix is to make them take up space and need to be unloaded before you can use them, just like everything else.   Another more drastic option is to treat them as "wild" resources and ignore the abilities entirely.[/i][/color][/-]
Turns out I misread the rule - they do have to be unloaded.   Thanks for the correction Matt!

In Undermining, players dig for resources on an alien world, making the best of the actions available to them to achieve short term goals (such as obtaining particular resources) while upgrading their mining vehicles and fulfilling contracts in the long term. To win, you need to earn more “star bucks” than anyone else, and you earn those by completing contracts, upgrading vehicles, finding alien technologies and having resources on hand at the end of the game.

Upgrading your mining vehicle – your UMVee – also provides it with special abilities that can come in handy throughout the game.

Undermining is a highly interactive game, with player actions sometimes benefiting and sometimes impacting the future actions of others. Competition for resources is important, of course, but using open tunnel spaces to get where you need to go – and blocking those spaces from opponents – is also key. Players can still move through other UMVees, but doing so costs battery power, and managing your batteries – which allow extra actions – is another important aspect of playing well.

Undermining comes with a double-sided game board, with player interaction being significantly different from one side to the other. With a random layout of resources, UMVee upgrades, contract variability, and one-off special bonuses from the finding of alien technology, no two games of Undermining are ever the same.

When you read the above, and see some pictures of the components, you want to play this game. At least, I did want to play this game. It seemed a very interesting concept to me. We set-up the game, read the rules, which are really easy to understand and explain. Played it and I had something in my mind of “Oh, this is all?”

Yes, that’s all. Easy and nice family game. Nothing wrong with it, but also nothing special. Just a family game to have a fun time together.

Neat little pick up & deliver game. Really gives the impression of trundling around,  drilling, and offloading stuff.

A ton of fun. Horribly underrated on this forum.

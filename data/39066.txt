As much as I like the designer's other games, I am not sure why I continue to indulge in these sorts of strategic level games; there is always something that leaves me dissatisfied, and my Rise and Decline of the Third Reich days are long behind me.

------------------------------------------------------
    

I wish the counters matched the map in overall feel and affect.  As is, they seem to slight the map.  Why is it that another GMT WWII game in Europe is able to capture all of the Scandinavian countries on its map, but TSC does not?  Don't these people ever talk with one another?  Stop slighting the, so called, "minor" countries.

I really enjoy this game! There is a lot on each turn to consider and factor in my decisions, which I like.  I also enjoy that the game lends itself to a historical, or similarly historical pathway still allowing for ahistorical decisions.  I have no problem with this type of simulation and find it fastinating to play out alternative strategies by each country.  I've ordered Unconditinal Surrender and will hope to compare the two sometime soon.

Playing The Great Crusade scenario. The DNA here is Totaler Krieg - lots of similarities in how corps, armies, and supports work, it has a similar "delay box" mechanic, and the size and scale are obviously about the same. It also is  pretty unforgiving until you get the hang of it - play short scenarios first.

Just initial impressions so far, but it's an interesting mix of stuff to like and quirky stuff. I like how expensive everything feels, and that you can't buy a lot of stuff, even basic infantry (a lot of games the Germans can dump tons of infantry late in the game, very unrealistic). I like the relatively low density. I like the air system, although it's quite abstract (which is fine!) and the bomber/flak relationship is a little odd. The ground combat system is unique and fairly clever, although it doesn't play quite as cleanly as I thought it might - adding up a lot of modifiers is still tricky. I think there are probably right and wrong answers in terms of tech investment - I'm not convinced it adds anything to players' strategic latitude - but it does make for tough timing decisions. Also nice to note a lot of the irritating micromanagement of TK! Is gone - the game has sensible strat-move rules.

I'm less enamoured of the amphibious invasion and strategic warfare stuff, which seem odd. Subs seem somewhat overpowered against surface fleets, although probably not as egregiously as some commentators feel (use the optional if it bugs you). Naval combat is *very* high-stakes as naval units are very expensive and combat is all-or-nothing. Tactics the British must use to preserve their fleet against U-Boats are a little anti-intuitive (use them for escorts, not sea control) - if you're playing the Western Allies, read the naval rules closely.

On balance though, I am drawn to The Supreme Commander by its fairly quick pacing and pretty good playability. Looking forward to trying a bigger game. Also looking forward to trying Unconditional Surrender - interesting that two games on the same scale with fairly similar design goals are so close together but they are quite different designs. Both are pretty appealing to me.

I have spent some time with this game. My initial impression is very positive. Very playable game for its scope. No waste on any unnecessary game systems. Focused game design elements that provide for strategy and trade-offs that don't bog down the game tempo. Very enjoyable experience that captures the essence of the war in Europe at this time. Thank you Danny and GMT.

Excellent design, turns are relatively fast but there are a lot of them in full campaign. I've only dolor and is solos great- just ignore the decoys. The criticism of amphibious landing is  wrong, fleets are too limited for landings to get out of control.

lowered my rating because we had too many issues we had to work through with the rules.  We loved the game and really liked the lack of unit density. (We play a lot of WIF).  they are working to clean up the rules and such and when that happens we will go back and change my score hopefully.  Great idea, think it was pushed through QC to fast.

...does a good job of covering the major issues with this game, though there are some other problems.  I had really high hopes for this one but it needs a complete revision (for a second time).  As problematic as it was, Avalon Hill's 3rd Reich did a better job of this over 30 years ago.  This one is deadly dull.

Original release has numerous errors on charts and some counters.  The rules have significant gaps and ambiguity.  On the plus side, work is progressing to provide corrections to the production issues and improve the clarity of the rules.

Some aspects are ahistorical, such as Germany starts the game at war with Britain and France but has the option to declare war on Poland.

preordered, Game arrived, rules read, first solo play up and running. map,counter and rule clarification issues. game seems to play fast and isn't complicated by any means, but does has depth based on limited resources and many choices. Update kit received. 

Have ongoing game on Vassal 2 player. Played 8 turns of 3 player ftf. I don't think this game will scale well beyond 3. Probably best as a 2 player game. Too much downtime early in the game for the Russian player. 

The game turns play fast. It is not a complicated game, but there are some subtle nuances you need to learn. Timing is important in a number of different areas. Much more playable than 3rd Reich and its different iterations, as well as WiF. Will probably see more plays, both solo and ftf than the others.

I think this is a very manageable ETO game with some clever mechanics.  I note that many of the lowest ratings are being generated by a failure to understand the naval game, claiming that U-Boats are overpowered.  The designer has done a good job discussing the naval concepts, which are not entirely conventional.  If you understand what the fleets are simulating then the concept makes excellent sense.  Don't let folks' failure to understand the U-Boat concept keep you from a good design.

U-Boats are absurdly powerful. Donitz said he needed 200 u-boats, in this bizarro TSC universe, he'd need about 10...  

Hexes, counters, 3000 minute playing time and it's a sad sack of a simulation...

52 pages of rules and diplomacy is still a bunch of silly dice rolls. This is 2015 not 1975 people!!! Diplomacy doesn't mean I throw money at a neutral country and pray I get lucky like a lottery!!! There is no cause and effect for diplomacy in TSC, which is pathetic. Romania joined the Axis because, after their defense guarantee from France was rendered meaningless by events in the West, the Soviets annexed Bessarabia and would have gobbled up the whole country if not for King Carol begging Hitler to send troops. It had nothing to do with Hitler sending Romania money and praying for boxcars... If the designer had learned his history from real life and not playing A3R, maybe he'd realize that... 7 pages of nation specific rules and they couldn't even model what I explained in 2 sentences...

First impressions after a short learning game and then a game which ran to early summer '42 before my opponent playing the Allies conceded. The Supreme Commander works well as a low-to-moderate-complexity strategic ETO game. Our game was somewhat spoiled by the chance factor - all the time spent on tactical manoeuvring and land battles seemed to have less effect on the overall result than a handful of dice rolls for Siberian reserves (1, 1, 2 - resulting in too few to defend Russia) and for a single naval battle in the North Atlantic (3 sub fleets against 4 allied surface fleets - my lucky rolling resulted in 2 surface fleets sunk at the cost of just an aborted sub fleet).

Another strategy counter game I played recently. I was first skeptical but in the end I have enjoyed it much more than Unconditional Surrender. It plays better in our view is not bothered by constant checking of tables for modifiers like USE and even narrative seemed to be better. 

Still I see clearly that I am not enjoying games without strong fog of war anymore. Thus I would prefer much more to play any block game or card driven game.

Interesting design that trys to make WWII grand strategic europe playable with design for effect.   My playings feel it is too abstract; fleets removed for 6 turns, 30 cost for a corp intially when UK is earning 70 a turn, adjaceny rule for diplomacy, defined introduction of forces to build.   All up it was enjoyable but the abstract nature wore a little thin.

Since the days of Third Reich, would this be the next definitive study on WWII at a grand scale?  For those who are not satisfied with the Europe Engulfed, me included, this should be the game that takes you to the local gaming club for an afternoon enjoyment.

On my oppinion the game works for the West, but feels like WW 1, especially in the East. No Breakthroughs, No Overruns No Exploitation and every unit even the smallest Corps has a ZOC. On the other side Technology is interesting and it is one of few games, which uses a Flank Bonus (which I like). Unfortunately for TSC there are better games around.

RATING: 7.5
Fast playing ETO type game with some novel ideas regarding combat, basing air units, technology, and more.  Despite the large number of turns, there's not much going on each turn, so experienced players can play quickly.  I think the system has a lot going for it, but I have some issues with diplomacy and fleet combat, where you can spend a lot of MSPs (currency for each country's production) for not much gain at times.  If there's one word that describes this game it is "unforgiving".  Make a mistake here or there, don't purchase items in the right sequence, roll poorly in fleet combat, etc., and you may as well start over again as there's no coming back.

Impressed with the components, nice.  CRT adds uncertainty, which makes optimal planning more difficult.  Works well with 3 players, scenarios and campaign are designed to be playable.  Game has stream lined rules, but still a substantial learning curve to overcome.  Lot's of potential, already seeing good replay value.  It looks like spending resources on diplomacy pays off for both sides.  All players will likely benefit from taking at least some chances, compared to playing it safe.  Comes with large and small version of the map, a nice option for smaller tables.  Overall a great package.  Superior.

Now that the unfortunate production problems have been resolved, this has become my go-to game for strategic-level WWII gaming. It rests comfortably between the generic treatments of introductory-level wargames on this topic that leave me wanting more and the insane detail of complex games like Compass Games' "The War" and GMT's "A World at War". 

There is quite a bit of randomness and chaos in this game so if that is not your cup of tea, you may want to look elsewhere for your gaming fix. For me, it is the right complexity level and the right size and time requirement to play and I am fine with some chaos in my games, so this is my kind of game.

This game is excellent. What is absolutely good is that lot of things are there (almost everything you can dream of: air, naval, bombing, politics, economy, diplomacy) but the flowing of the game is absolutely EASY to learn, clear and with very few exceptions. I'm an absolute fan of Axis Empire but this one is more streamlined and perfect to have a good time dealing with WWII. 

I bloody wait for a partner game about the Pacific War: this will immediately make me raise the rating to te

The game plays very quickly. I have played it several times since it came last month. One can get through the first two years in a couple of hours. There are lots of strategies to choose from. This reminds me of playing 3R in the 1970s. I really like the way Dan has taken the best aspects of a variety of game systems. He has also been very good about responding to questions.

I've mostly played snippets of the main 1939 campaign scenario, consisting of five or six turns before I have to pack it away again.   I like the low counter density and the ease of managing the MSP resource system.   The game is somewhat dependent upon its quirky accounting system for breaking down units and building them up again.   After a few turns, it's possible to play most of the phases without reference to the rules which is amazing for a ETO game of this sophistication.

RATING: 7
I would define it a pure strategic game. It focus not upon ''how many'' but ''how much'' will cost me the attack ? Also introduce a lot of fresh rules. Chits are substituted by various charts giving you much more control upon research developing and minor country alignment.
The main problem is that doesn't simulate well II world war strategy and the capability to invade everywhere since early war does not represent the real difficulties allied had the first years of war.

Grand strategy WW2 game that should be praised more than it is. It plays well and after one or two games needed to handle rules you can play whole WW2 Europe theater in few hours. Only complain can be player count - the game is definitely not playable in 5 and not even in 4 players because there's not enough game for everyone. The Supreme Commander really shines in 2-3 players so keep that in mind.

Really excited about this one. Low counter density, medium-low complexity and more chrome than one might guess based on the "low" density/complexity description.

 Plus this game uses strength differential as opposed to ratios. For a dude like me who can't tell a 3:2 odds attack from a kick in the ass it's great. 

I may even try to get my retarded friend to play.

Wanted to like the game - and certainly appreciate the simple nature of the rules and gameplay - but find this level of simulation (grand strategic) to be uninteresting to me.  Coupled with the attrition focused CRT/combat (the idea that you go into combat with the idea of losing less a % of your turn build than the other guy - see France 1940 in this game - left me flat.

Played this multiplayer and land system can be fun but naval system has overpowered U-Boats and no tension for sea supply.  Seems under developed except for land.  Air is okay.  Excellent political rules, probably the best I've seen.

Second game showed issues with limited exploitation, west front in 1940 looked like 1914.

Does move along pretty fast turn wise for an ETO strategic game, with fixed U-boats and some real armored second impulse type movement/combat rather than just a second attack phase could have a real winner.

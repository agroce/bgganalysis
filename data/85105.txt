Interesting mix of board game with geography.  The gameplay is actually pretty fun, but can be really tough when playing the Europe map with tiny countries.

With a few number of players, it is often very beneficial to just automatically select the "no country" option.

Sweet variation on the 10days in wherever theme. 

Timed gaming means some pressure, but not too much, and the guesswork for trying to make the shortest trip between three points is sheer genius.

Highly recommended. Not in stock much, so snag it when you can.

Vlaada Chvatil is easily the most creative and versatile boardgame designer around: each year he ships one new game that's very different from everything else he imagined before.
This year's release, however, is aimed to a different target group than mine. It's some kind of geography quiz, somewhat entertaining (the factoids about the US states are unbelievable), but kinda repetitive and without much depth...

Always fun to play, the Europe map is a lot more fun though, the US is rather boring because the distances are always rather similar, whereas in Europe it can be quite deceiving with the non-uniform shape of states.

RATING: 6
Take this rating with a large grain of salt.  I was out of the room for at least the last 2 rounds of the game, so I didn't really get to see the climax of how the game works.  I like what they tried to do, though.  It has a nice educational feel, but it doesn't really punish players too much for messing up.  I also like the fall-back position of "I don't know where in the heck to go, so I'll just take 40!"

The downside, and what will keep me from purchasing the game, is simply the fact that it isn't really my style of game.  I'm not a huge fan of geography games, and this one requires a decent amount of geographical knowledge.  But, even moreso is the speed element.  I'm just not excited about speed games, and most of my family struggles with them.  So, although there is a good game here that a lot of people will enjoy, it just isn't a good game for me.

RATING: 5
April, 2011: I really couldn't get into this game, and sensed that some other players (well, Dave) also felt the same way. The "not next to the state" thing was a little frustrating, because it was actually an advantage to know not precisely where things were, but where things sort-of where.

Also suffers a bit from "play in 5 seconds, take too long to score and pass out money". In the entire course of the game you only have about 30 seconds of any mental activity. This causes it to really drag.

Overall, I don't think this really works as either an entertainment or educational game. Had it been about what states are next to one another, then perhaps I would have learned something, but in the end I'm left with no take-aways from our play.

Initial rating a 5.

Definitely not a game that grabbed me and makes me want to play again.  The best thing about the game was its length (i.e. it's short).

Jan 2014 - Dropped to a six as this doesn't seem to be hitting the table much. It's an interesting concept, but not very replayable due to only two maps. I'm guessing you could manufacture your own maps and cards quite easily, but not sure I can be bothered.

Dec 2011 - First impressions are interesting. Looking forward to playing with the kids to see how that goes. This could go up from a starting 7 rating. I'm beginning to really appreciate Vlaada Chvatil as a designer.

Well executed educational game, for teaching locations of European countries and American states. After playing Europe, immediately wanted to play US states map (as I knew I would be worse at it). After a few rounds of scoring my knowledge of US geography certainly improved. What a weird thing the "four corners" is.  Anyway for someone needing a game teaching geography this is pretty excellent. I am not that person, and I really can`t see much replay value in it for the long term.

Your task is to pick a country or countries most suitable for your trip and to do it faster than your opponents. How many borders do you cross on your trip from France to Russia? Is it more or less than from Norway to Turkey? Detailed knowledge of the map is an advantage, but can be easily beaten by good intuition and fast decision making.

I got this game for literally £1 from a discount store (it was the last copy and had minor box damage) and it was absolutely worth it. Every single time I play this game I enjoy it a ton! It's by far my favourite light game, and the great components including paper money that's actually worth a damn put it nicely up there with some of the greats. 

Shout out to the Africa fan expansion on the files section, which I have printed up a copy of, and also I made my own English Counties version too.

Players are bloggers, travelling around either Europe or the USA, trying to do it on the cheap!  Fun semi-trivia game where players launch from a starting city, and have to choose a destination city from a selection of seven options.  You then pay a penalty for every border you crossed, so you don't want to travel too far, but you get a hefty penalty if you cop out and only jump one country!  The game gradually ramps up over seven rounds, travelling to two countries, then a departure and arrival country, and so on.   Plays in about 30 minutes and is fun enough.  The speed element, trying to grab the good options first, helps a lot here.  Scoring bogs down a little.  Fun game.

Another party game in the vein of "get close without getting TOO close".   This one has a speed geography element, which doesn't particularly appeal to me but I can see where it can be educational.

Especially ideal for people who enjoy geography, with educational value, and a fresh take in learning the map of Europe and USA, but certainly not limited to those with skills or interest in maps.  Fast and fun requiring real-time simultaneous selection that prevents it becoming trivial pursuit.  Negative comments remark that the card playing is fast-paced but scoring is comparatively tedious, or that they didn't care for the geography/trivia; but for the most part it's very accessible and enjoyable for a range of people, particularly the 30 minute play time helps.  Typical innovation from designer Vlaad!

Very solid game that probably does a better job of teaching geography than the 10 Days' series.  Even if you don't know Europe or America well when you start playing, by the end of the game, you'll have a pretty good idea of where everything is.  It has next to no player interaction, but it's quite challenging and plays relatively quickly with everyone highly motivated to make their simultaneous turns as fast as possible.

It's a lot of fun, even with 2 players. We find the final round of the contest can feel a bit more random, and it's hard to get your head around after playing the game the opposite way the whole time.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2012)

Vladda is my favorite game designer and this game shows why. It is very different than any other game I have played. Vlaada always delivers exciting versatile games with cool mechanics and weird themes. I bought this game only because Vlaada designed it and I wasn´t disappointed. I like Travel Blog well enough.

The game is obviously educational, and thus it has a limited span of plays in it. As soon as you know all the maps it only leaves how fast can you plan your trips and even then, the game can be fun I think. However, as I don´t plan to play this game often, the replayability should not be a concern. With the right crowd this can be a great party game. :D (although I suck at it, perhaps with maps from my country or continent I could do better.) I have only played with the Europe map, my knowledge of geography in North America is practically zero.

The game has good components, although the paper maps suffer with the gameplay.

If you like geography, this is the game for you. I don´t particularly like this theme but as the game is a Vlaada I will keep it.

You could be asking if I like the game so much, why I’m rating it so low? Well in an effort to keep to the BGG rating guidelines, this is not a game I want to play often, but it can be fun if I play it sporadically, thus I rate it a 6.0.

I had high hopes for this one, but was disappointed.  I'm not sure who the target audience is.  It's too hard for little kids, but this type of geography exercise is not that fun for adults.  And while you can't play randomly, it seemed like most times different routes resulted in the same cost.  Games where there is a lengthy evaluation period afterward (I'm thinking of Galaxy Trucker, Bunny Bunny Moose Moose and Santy Anno here) are very problematic, in that it needs to be engaging enough to keep people's attention, and it never is.  And while I enjoy having a speed element to a game, here I'm not sure it really adds anything.

LIKES:

* Geography on speed - could be helpful for kids in learning their geography for USA and Europe.
* Creative idea of developing shortest route without allowing the use of a bordering state.
* Instructions are simple and easy to follow/teach.

DISLIKES:

* I'd prefer to play other speed games if I'm in the mood for one.  There are other speed games that interest me more even if they aren't about geography!  
* Scoring feels quite tedious and slow after fast pace of the actual selection of states and countries.

RATING: 5
First impression (4 players): It's basically a trivia game about geography of USA or Europe. You need to plan trip from country (state) to another (by doing a couple of detours in later phases) by passing through minimum number of other countries. But there is a penalty if you choose two countries that share border between them. That's it basically. One or two countries are chosen as beginning (and end) and then you must in as fast as you can choose best option(s) (from random selection of 7 countries) and those are slow get penalties for choosing same countries that have been chosen already.

I personally suck at geography and therefore isn't really excited about the game. As a fun trivia/party/family type of game it is pretty ok.

Update (22.5.2011): After a second game rating dropped again to 5. Mechanically it is a solid game but it also very boring.

Probabilmente il gioco meno riuscito di Vlaada Chvátil che abbia provato. Più che un gioco però lo trovo un utile e istruttivo metodo per ripassare la geografia e soprattutto i confini di stato. Il gioco per la verità non è nemmeno molto intuitivo e i primi turni si rischia di giocare senza aver capito bene il calcolo dei soldi. Gioco che si lascia giocare ma potrebbe lasciare indifferenti. Anche il materiale non mi sembra studiato in modo attento.

More of a speed geography pop quiz rather than a game. 7 country cards are revealed, then 1 in the middle, and as quickly as possible you declare a route by placing your token on 1 of the 7 countries, best points awarded for the shortest route between your chosen country and the central country. Later rounds complicate things by choosing two countries, and by having 2 countries in the middle, but it's all the same process. Those who know their geography best will quickly find the shortest available route fastest (rather than guessing) and score best, so it’s not much of an equal table going in. It’s too repetitive by the end, and there’s not much game there. A round is so quick that most of your time is actually spent counting up scores rather than actually playing anything. As such, I’ve no need to play again unless asked to fill out a table.

This speed geography trivia game requires knowledge of a very specific type--namely, which countries/states border which other countries/states.  Basically, you're grabbing endpoints for your routes and scoring based on the number of regions in-between them.  I thought the game was decent, but knowing which regions border which other regions seems pretty trivial even by trivia standards.  Be prepared for some hand-bumping in claiming the cards, too.

Update: Actually interesting as a solo play trying to improve on your previous earnings.

This design is really a recall test to see if I was paying attention whilst playing the 10 Days in USA and Europe, a series which I consider provides fairer means of promoting geography awareness, rather than penalising lack of knowledge.

Sure it is fun to see the monetary blowouts and the occasional speed collision for the perceived valuable location, but what really relegates Travel Blog is the scoring. You can't really score each placement simultaneously and sometimes it requires retracing and recounting to minimise or double check the payouts: this may trigger the attitude to check again as it isn't always intuitive to see shortcuts. Because of this longwinded method I would never again play with more than 4 players, and sadly I don't really feel the need to play, shame as I like the individually drawn locations and quirky facts. I have other titles to fall back on to satisfy my Geography education.

Vlaada Chvatil is an insanely versatile designer - I'd never have guessed he was behind Travel Blog if I didn't already know. A very peculiar concept for a game: racing to plan the shortest route through a chain of European countries or US states without looking at the map, but being penalised for choosing neighbouring countries. The increasing difficulty levels as you go through the game work well and make it very easy to teach. I didn't much like the cop-out '40' space though, it's more fun if players are forced to commit and face the consequences.

Excellent, excellent game.  I love map stuff and this one shows me how little I know about geography, yet it's fun to try to puzzle through the rounds and come up with routes not completely ridiculous.

Great game with educational aspects. Super for kids (and adults)) learning geography.

RATING: 6
A game that proves all to well how deficient we might be in geography.  Destinations are determined as are potential intermediate stops - so players need to quickly decide which route (if any) is the shortest.  But not too short as adjacency is a demerit.  Quick playing fun that is almost like a gang "10 Days" game.

I think this game is wonderfully clever and fun, but my gaming group seems to not like a trivia game in the guise of a euro game, so it probably won't be played as much as I would like.

Picked this up from Tanga for $2.99 with free shipping.

Picked up a copy for $2.99.  Like Chvatil's Codenames games and how can you resist that price?

We modified the game to eliminate the speed grab of the locations to make it more enjoyable for my son who is good at geography but not at thinking fast.  It changes the game but not in a bad way in my mind.

RATING: 6
More an educational aide than a game, it never-the-less provides some enjoyment and laughs for the gamers. Hard to see it getting repeated outings if the kids aren't playing though. I'd recommend it for a school looking for something to spice up the geography classes. A nice light game that's quick and not going to hurt even the serious gamers amongst you.

If you like geography and travel this will appeal to you. Mechanically too simple for the tastes of my usual gaming opponents, but I am looking forward to playing this with my kid when she gets a bit older.

Bought new from Tanga.  A very light Chvatil game that is best for family and teaching kids (or challenged adults) geography. Not a bad game but why play this when so many better games out there.  Sold it as it would be unlikely to play again.

RATING: 6
Not entirely reliant on geography. Knowing if two states/countries are adjacent or somewhat close also depends on personal associations and other geopolitical forms of proximity, as that's often the first thing that pops in your head and you have to rely on those instincts; visualizing a map just takes too long. College football (i.e. the conferences) and other sports have helped me a great deal in this game. And I once instantly realized Mississippi and Louisiana were adjacent because of True Blood Season 3.

The theme is wicked clever; you pay for your trips, then in the final round, you're paid for the most convoluted trip you can plan because you've made it as a travel blogger. Picking destinations that are close, but not too close is also brilliant, ensuring that no geography master will take naturally to this game.

Yes, your performance in this game is determined by your outside knowledge, and this is squarely one of those "show-off" party games, but that never hurt the popularity of other party games like Wits & Wagers.

A quick playing geography game that actually manages to be pretty fun.  I imagine it would be good for playing with kids, though I have only played with adults so far.

RATING: 6
An interesting game which requires very few rules, and can be quite skewed depending on geographical knowledge. I would imagine this could be quite fun with a large number of people, but with 3 or 4 it's not very exciting.

Reminds me of a game I played as a kid where you had to draw state cards and link them up.  I think it had "Chase" in the title.  Actually, I liked that game better.  I don't like the speed element here and the scoring is strange.  Contains the seeds of a very good game but something is missing.

Just an OK game - play this with the kids to try and improve their geography.
Update - trade this away in April 2012 Maths Trade. Just couldn't see myself playing it again, and the completist in me wasn't bothered about letting it go either.

US (foreign version will have foreign "state" names). Read the rules. Not sure about the replayability of the game once the players have a good feel for the optimal paths from a country. Vlaada seems to be going downhill in his game designs, unfortunately.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a game of remembering how many border crossings are required to go from country to country in Europe or from state to state in the USA.  Those with geography knowledge will be at an advantage.  There is some fun in that you have to claim countries faster than other players, so the game forces you to play faster than other players.

I'd play this if I was a geography teacher, or with children.  It's a fine educational game, just far from a typical Vlaada off-the-wall fun-fest.

Fun game. It is well designed and great to learn geography. It is addictive (you want play again), but after 6-7 times, more or less you "learn" the map. Very nice game for families.

RATING: 6
Fast-paced and fun. As novices, we've had a lot of fun in the "I have no idea where anything is" department. The speed element is good too, like the last-round mad rushes to Hawaii. For people of roughly equal geographical knowledge, it's a bit random, but it could be lopsided I assume if there are some geographical wizards.

We like to travel and we like to blog (3 blogs at the moment). Combine it should give almost the perfect game to us. Well it isn’t.
 
The game-box says age 8 and up. We think it’s age 6 and up. It’s a geographical game, in which you have to create the shortest (or longest, it depens on in which route you play) route between to states/countries (depens on the continent you play). How better the topographic skills of the player is, the easier it gets. The game components are nice, and it could be fun if you play with 6, but then it is fun because of the company, not because of it’s such a great game.

A "micro-turn" game similar to Luna in that each turn you choose one quick simple action from a moderate size list of actions. While turns are quick, decisions are not always easy. 

The goal is to score the most points by game end, which ends in the round where the ruling Medici family fade out; the theme makes some sense as you are one of several families jockeying to become the new power in Renaissance Italy. On your turn you choose from: 1) rolling die to place more meeples/messengers which are always useful as you can perform actions for a longer duration of turns, 2) collect favour from one of several different middlemen, with these favours being a key stepping stone to scoring real points, 3) exert your influence in an outside region- this requires an investment of cash, spending of favours, and it permanently locks up one of your meeples but similar to hansa tectonica, the earlier you decide to do this the better your return on investment. And what do you get out of this?  You collect either a one-time bonus tile and score significant end game points, or you obtain either a permanent bonus ability tile and score minor end game points or you obtain and end game scoring tile, which can be significant, and score minor end game points. It should also be noted that you will score additional end game points for having majority in each distant region and for having presence in all of these regions (two of the regions are not actually distant they are in the capital city). 4) the last option is to collect/deactivate your meeples and score a gold for doing so, not productive but necessary from time to time similar to games like Tournay. At any time during your turn you can travel around the board but this costs gold to do so. 

The clock of the game are the Medici tiles which are triggered when certain city spots are locked down. These are clearly marked and the tiles activation power are hidden but are from a known short list of negative events. 

The game scales well from 2-4 players, has good components and is a solid medium weight euro.

[b]After 1 play (3 players)[/b]:

Being one of the games that Pegasus Spiele published for Hall Games, together with LUNA, RIALTO and others, I decided to try it. I didn't know anything about the game before, except for the setting - Medieval Italy (Tuscany). The rules explanation didn't take too long, mostly because the rules are simple and the player aids from the box pretty much explain them all.

The gaming components are "regular", nothing too exuberant, with wooden "meeples" and cardboard tokes. The mapboard, on the other hand, has drawings close to the map paintings of the era. So, it is one of the boards that can be framed and would look great on a wall. But, gaming wise, it is too busy and the eyes need some time to adjust in order to see all the towns and roads. 

The main mechanism is some kind of worker placement, with each player starting the game with four family members, who will gather resources in order to access special scoring towns. When you decide to go in the special towns (to place members who will score at the end), those members are sacrificed and cannot be used again. It costs you one action to put a new member on the map, so you have to evaluate whether you will place a new member or go in the scoring towns.

The main issue I have with this game, besides being too bland, is the presence of some "overpowered" City Council tiles. During setup, each player chooses one from three of these tiles, with all providing a permanent bonus during play. Of all the tiles, two have a bonus with which someone can place for free (during some actions) a family member. I think these are OP and can mess the game.

Harvest resources and convert them into victory points by buying positions in regional courts or heading for Florence.  The whole game seems stale from its Renaissance Italy theme to simple engine building and point gathering.  The one fresh element - the wandering middlemen who enable a resource to be gathered - just aren't that interesting.

The artwork is inoffensive and production quality is good.  The rules are well written.

Enjoyed second play more than first.  The City Coiuncil tiles allowing the collection of extra bishops and florins freed the game up tremendously and stopped it being the frustrating game I'd first experienced.

Alapvetően semmi újat nem mutatott a játék, mégis tetszett. Szép, letisztult, egzakt, egyszerű szabály és rövid játékmenet.

A játék mechanizmusa számomra egy felturbózott Valdora.
Annál azonban pont annyival komplexebb, amely minden megerőltetés nélkül kellő szórakoztatást és izgalmat nyújt.
Nem egy korszakos játék (mint pl.a Goa!) - valószínűleg 2-3 év múlva feledésbe merül (ez is...!) -, de bármikor elővéve garantálja a jó szórakozást.
A tartozékok minősége, a játék megjelenése, a szabályrendszer összetettsége, a játékidő hossza egy jó iparosmunka eredménye. Akár a társasjátékokkal most ismerkedőkkel is remekül játszható.
"Recommended" kategória...

One of these games that are not really noticed, but very on my style.  A kind of "follow the nobles wherever they go" to get their valuable tokens, then use them for points.  Timing is the real concept of the game.  Very nice to look at, quite original mechanics, and very entertaining.  I would say it stays in the same niche as Pergamon, for example.

This is a good euro. The only thing I did not like was the only original mechanic :D - the rotating mediators. But it's not that bad.
Other than that, I'd like one more ability per player in the game setup and in the game end to call it even better.
Not a waste of time.

Il Vecchio is an exercise in efficency designed by old master Rudiger Dorn.
Each turn players can do only one simple action: collect stuff in a city where they have one of their pawns, or send one of their pawns to one of the five score tracks, collecting some sort of in-game or end-game bonus.
Turns are so essential that downtime is minimum, barring players with exceptional problems of analysis paralysis.
The way players chain their actions must be the most efficient to win: the game reminds me of Thurn und Taxis for this extreme need for efficiency, but it has much less randomness (and a simple variant further mitigates this factor).

Eseen 2012: First play. Rules are somewhat vague regarding the middleman but once resolved the rules are very straightforward. Very much a race to get to the preferred tracks before your opponants and a need to balance your options depending on their choices. Little if not any screwage and a very accommodating game structure that never really closes a player out. As a result the final scores for three players were very close (only 2 points margin).

A very quick game with sharp players or could be a complete dirge if AP prone players involved. However there is no reasonable excuse for AP as a players turn can be pretty well worked through before hand as long as an eye is kept out for others options.

Multiple sheets with explanations of the tiles icons will speed things up. A fun fast light to medium game with the right players.

Better game than the BGG rating may make you think... 

As a medium weight eurogame, Il Vecchio fulfills all what you can expect: one hour of game play (if not less), interesting combos, fast decisions and almost zero downtime. 

Going to Firenze to get different VP goals vs. actions improvements is very interesting because you'll want to go for all very fast but you can't.

In conclusion, an over the average game from a very good and often underrated desinger...

Not a ton to say on this one other than Rüdiger Dorn knows what he's doing. Really nice resource management/positioning game with special powers. The fast, single-actoin turns are a big win here. Not particularly evocative, but makes up for it with pure professionalism: clean with no rough edges, well-balanced but not to a fault, graphic design that is effective and attractive, and then the special powers give it a lot of variety and nuance. It's a mostly open information game, and those are generally less appealing in these parts and will keep it from regularly hitting the table, but for what it is, excellent.

Very fun, and very different game.  I wasn't sure I'd like it going in,  but I ended up really enjoying it.  Scoring can be a bit confusing at the end, and it takes at least one play through to learn the symbols on the tiles, but overall a very good game.

I like, but don’t love, a lot of Dorn’s games (Goa is by far the best, and I don’t really care for Jambo, while Arkadia is okay). This one falls into the “meh” category. It’s a very mechanic game which I normally don’t mind, but in this game it just felt too “scripted” and “mechanical”. It is a very quick game, though, which takes less than an hour. But there are many other games I would prefer before this one. The play is rather easy going as you do a single action on your turn out of a handful of actions (iirc). The end game bonus tiles are crucial, and they are quite different, meaning that you can pursue some different strategies. I like how the middlemen move around the board so you need to plan a little ahead. And it’s cool that you sort of choose yourself when the game ends (you can speed up and force the game ending if you’re focused, and this can really screw your opponents’ plans, which is awesome). But it felt like a generic eurogame which unfortunately wasn’t too much fun to play.

Return of the [i]good[/i] lightish middleweight Euro! I don't know if it's just me, but it seems that so many of the games these days are either heavy, or light. I like those, but what happened to "just right"? I guess there are still some light games, but most don't seem to be interesting enough, whereas this one does. The thing I like about this is that turns are [b]fast[/b]. So fast that in our first game, often it was your turn again by the time you finished resolving your previous turn. There's a bit of randomness, but not so much that it feels like a random fest. No niggle corner case rules. Great graphic design / iconography. A definite keeper.

Utterly boring and game-less pickup-and-deliver title with little interaction beyond moving middlemen out of reach of opponents, which gets harder and harder the more family members appear on the board. The game becomes decidedly chaotic as a consequence, stressing the absence of an actual interesting game even further... in my opinion to barely above breaking point. (Breaking because there is nothing to do, not because the mechanisms on their own are dysfunctional.) In this category I think the game of Santiago de Cuba is better: that game keeps moving along nicely, and finishes well before outstaying its welcome. Il Vecchio doesn't: players must continue to specialise, find yet more of the same resources and money to pay for this or that, in ways which do not really change since the beginning. I find it hard to believe I actually wanted to play this game at some point, and pay someone for the privilege of explaining it to me with a nice dinner. Good thing that never came to pass!

Il Vecchio was fun.  It took a little to get started.  Once I got used to the iconography and figured what I wanted to do things sped up.
There were a lot of reference checks.  But it got better.
Planning ahead required staging more than one thing at a time in case another player took what you were planning on.  So you have to adjust on the fly.  
There were plenty of choices for actions.  So you can choose to compete for scoring or seek your own.
It was fun.  But a long first play that might be tough to break in new players.

Plays *quick* and works really well with three players. But, I'm not sure about its ability to trump other games from getting to the table if you have a large collection, so it might come out only once or twice a year. Then again, I got it for $15, and it's worth way more than that. I suspect it will be the kind of game to introduce to different kinds of groups if they are gamers -- might take some convincing if they are not.

I'm not getting the comparisons to Hansa Teutanica, though, apart from the look of the board.

Pretty standard euro, that has a resource pick up and map movement mechanic that works well.  Planning ahead is fairly pointless as there are so many ways for the resources you need to move away from you.  This can lead to a lot of AP, as players can't really think about their turns in advance.  The symbology is complex, so we spent a ton of time looking up symbols, and in a lot of cases this had to be done in secret, so this drug the game out to 2.5 hours.  I'd still probably play this one again, but it doesn't deserve the shelf space to own.

Players are power players in medieval Tuscany, trying to undermine the Medici family and seize power.

Interesting game where players move pieces around a map of Tuscany, meeting up with "middle men", who hand over resources.  The resources are spent on infiltrating Florence, and the surrounding kingdoms of Venice, Rome, etc, which reward the players with victory points and increasing powers.  These can trigger Medici events, where the great family lashes out at the players.  The game ends after a certain number of Medici events.

Interesting game from Rudiger Dorn - and one that is very easy to like.  The mechanics are easily explained and the game play fast and breezy.  Ultimately it felt rather vanilla and just a bit bland.  Get an engine up and running, and then flick over the victory point generation.  Three plays were enough to see it all.

Egyedül próbáltam ki, 3 játékost irányítva. Elsőre tetszett a játék. Habár jó hosszúra elnyúlt, ezt a tervező is érezte, mert amikor lapkát szerzel, akkor a többiek folytathatják a körüket, amíg a lapkákat böngészed, hiszen úgyis csak a következő körödben használhatod. A holtidő egyébként elég rövid lehet, mivel a körödben összesen egy akciót hajthatsz végre. Előre is kell gondolkozni, mert a lapkák szerzéséhez bizonyos "nyersanyagra" van szükséged, amit bizonyos városokhoz irányított "jómunkásemberrel" (a játékban családtag :)) lehet megszerezni, de ennyire nem egyszerű a helyzet. Csak olyan városban tudunk valamit szerezni, ahol egy intéző (vagy valamilyen hasonló titulussal illetett szakember) is  jelen van, aki ennek hatására szépen tovább masírozik az óra járásának megfelelően a következő hozzáillő (ugyanolyan szimbóluma van, mint ami rajta található) városba, ezzel egy jókora csavart téve a játékba. A szerencse szerepe nem kicsit van jelen, aminek a csökkentésére egyébként a szabály is ad lehetőséget, habár szerintem a lapkák értékének aránytalanságát az sem tudja kiküszöbölni, s ebben lehet a játék gyengesége is. Cserébe nem kell legalább valami ellen küzdeni (éhenhalás, rágcsáló invázió, stb.), mert azt annyira nem szeretem az euró játékokban. Lassan rá kell jöjjek, hogy nekem tetszenek az ehhez hasonló játékok, miszerint szerez bizonyos dolgokat, amit vigyél el valahová, ahol szerezhetsz valami mást, ami az előnyödre szolgál és végül mindenhol megpróbálsz minél több győzelmi pontot kicsikarni nem kevés agysejt égetés árán. Ez a játék nem sok újat mutat, nekem mégis tetszett, csak rendkívül hosszúnak találtam és eléggé aránytalannak. Ami még nem tetszett, az a lapkák ikonográfiája. A játék végére sem tudtam sok lapkán kiigazodni, ezért állandóan a szabályt kellett bújnom mire is szolgálnak, annyira nem volt egyértelmű. Lehet teszek vele még egy próba játékot, mielőtt a család elé engedem. (2015.05.25.)
Kipróbáltuk ketten is. Végül nem rossz játék, csak mindkettönknek a fura jelző jutott az eszünkbe. Kicsit erősnek tartom a jobb alsó sarokban lévő várost. Kíváncsi lennék mi lenne, ha mindenki egyszerre akarna odamenni. Egy játékot még mindenképp rááldozunk ennek kiderítésére. (2015.06.18.)

RATING: 6
Be opportunistic by gathering the cheapest resources from the chaotic board state, use special powers to specialize and maximize your turn efficiency, race against opponents for majorities, and aim for private end-game scoring goals. It's Euro through and through: most of the thinking is in deciphering the game's puzzle, you can't easily interfere with others, and your actions chaotically generate a puzzle for your next opponent. As a result it's a fairly insular efficiency race, with tension from majorities, endgame timing, and opaque scoring.

I was recently introduced to the acronym JASE, which apparently is "Just Another Soulless Euro".  Il Vecchio is [b]WABE - Weyhey Another Brilliant Euro[/b].  The game has sat on the shelf for two years waiting for its moment.  And its moment came.  And it is a brilliant game. 

You will really enjoy this game if you like games such as Hansa Teutonica, Marco Polo, Orleans and the like.  At heart it is a pick-up-and-deliver game but there are so many interesting things going on and so many skill-upgrades to investigate that being labelled with just that genre does the game no favours.  And the rules are so simple, just a couple of pages of key instruction.  And you only make one action a turn so turns are fast and downtime is low.

The game got somewhat lost amongst the 2013 releases which is a shame as it is a very good game indeed.  And it plays very well with three, which I suspect is the sweet spot.

Elsőre én is azt mondtam volna, mint Lacxox, h még nem Goa/Genoa szintű, így aludva rá, hát ha nem is az szint, de igen közel hozzá.
Ugyebár a Mediciek korában vagyunk, nemesi családokat alakítunk, akiknek nem tetszik már a Mediciek hatalma, és próbáljuk kitúrni őket onnan.
A játék maga 3 területen zajlik:
I. a városokban. Itt gyakorlatilag követőket gyűjthetünk (amik a külső régiókhoz szükséges támogatás), és bizonyos életünket megkönnyítő dolgokat (ingyen utazás, a városokban "gyűjtés/beszerzés"-hez szükséges eszköz, illetve Firenze elitjébe jutáshoz szükséges dolog, na meg pénz (érdekes a pénzszerzés egyik formáját teljesen hanyagoltuk mindannyian....)) - ha van ott családtagunk (emberünk).
A városokban, ahogy Laci is írta: vagy közvetítők segítségével szerezzük be a fentebbieket, és akkor inaktív lesz az emberünk, vagy az itt beszerezhető cuccok egyike segítségével, és akkor aktív marad az emberünk, de cucc elveszik.
A közvetítők egy jól számítható saját pályán mozognak városról városra (mindegyik adott típusú városban )található meg.
II. Külső régiók:
Mindhárom külső régió ugyanazon az elven épül fel:
Bizonyos követőkért, és plusz pénzért (ami egyre több, minél később megyünk az adott területre) pontokat kapunk a játék végén (ami annál nagyobb, minél hamarabb megyünk az adott régióra) és választhatunk egy egyszeri kedvezményt (az adott régió összes kedvezményét átnézve).
A 3 régió közt a különbség az "erejük": 3 különböző szintű: mennyi pénz kell hozzá, mennyi pontot ad, milyen értékű egyszeri támogatást.
III. Beépülés Firenze vezetésébe
EZ 2 módon:
Városi tanács: itt olyan támogatásokat szerezhetünk, amik a játék végéig kifejtik hatásuk (5 lapból választunk 1-et, a többi vissza a halom aljára)
Illetve a nemesség: ők pedig a játék végén adnak pontokat bizonyos feltételek teljesítése esetén

Ez a 3 terület 3 akciótípus, és ezenkívül még 2 akció lehetőség: inaktív embereink aktiválása, illetve újabb családtagok bevetése.

A játékban a szerencse 2 módon jön be:
Az emberek felhelyezése kockadobással (ezt azért kompenzálja az utazás, és pláne a hintós ingyen utazás lehetősége), illetve a mindenkire ható Mediciek bosszúja (medici címerek hatásai)
E kettő azonban kihagyható a stratégiaibb játék érdekében, ez a szabályban is szerepel.
(Őszintén: én a kockát hagynám, mert nem rossz, a Medici címerek hatásait viszont kivenném: csúnyán beboríthatja a terveket. De ez szabadon választott opció a szabály szerint is)
Pontok járnak a régiókért, a Firenzére tett emberekért, az ide tett bábuk többségi értékeléséért (minden területen külön többségi értékelés), a medici címerekért, a nemességlapkák teljesített feltételeiért, meg néhány apróságért.
Szóval nekem nagyon tetszett. És újabb játékkal nőhet a pontszám is.
Update:
Azóta újabb 2 játékon túl.
Még mindig tetszik.
Szoros kis összecsapások voltak (pl a legutóbbi első 3: 1 -1 pontra egymástól). A medici cimerek tényleg hoznak szerencsét és bekavarást, de ettől még izgis. lehet legközelebb kipróbáljuk a szerencse menetített javaslatot, ami a szabályban. Ugyanakkor továbbra is be lehet kaavrni a másiknak. nem is nagyon, de azért simán :-), nekem pl most egy plusz körömbe került vmit elérni, amit így már csak más után értem el, és így már nem tudtam beelőzni....

RATING: 6
Il Vecchio, is an interesting, quick and relatively easy to learn euro game where every player starts with a unique player power.  I definitely feel like it has some similarities to Hansa Teutonica in the following ways: there is a spatial aspect to the game, sometimes players will sacrifice the use of their player pieces permanently for scoring opportunities, each player will have unique capabilities as the game progresses, every now and again players have to use an action to refresh their player pieces, players can influence how quickly the game can end, and both feel like multiplayer abstract games even compared to other euros.  Il Vecchio has more luck involved in the game than Hansa Teutonica due to the dice as well as tile draw.  There is a variant in the book that removes dice from the game, but then some of the tiles that provide special abilities literally have no special benefit.  On the up side, Il Vecchio seems less volatile.  What I mean by that is, in Hansa if players don't keep other players in check (ie allowing a player to amass too many action early in the game) it can lead to a less than stellar game experience. Thus far, Il Vecchio definitely seems worthy for exploration but I based on what I've seen, I worry that it lacks the variety from game-to-game to stay permanently in my collection.

Quite a nice Euro.  Feels like the board is spinning around your workers.  Extremely strong, yet very indirect player interaction.  Micro-turns are another win for me.

The only drag is the heavy symbol use on the 30+ tiles in the game.  Which means people sit with the rulebook for a really long time.

Wow, I had a great time. I lost our game, but who cares if you have fun the entire time you're playing? A smart game. The rules were a bit tough to get my head around until we played a round or two, then I realized this game is actually easy to grasp.

Jugado a 2: El juego es de una mecánica sencilla, en esencia recolectas tokens y luego los utilizas para tener mayoría en las ciudades. Me pareció un buen juego, con respecto al tiempo nos llevó 1.5 horas con todo y explicación. Lo único que frena el tiempo del juego es la consulta de los beneficios de las losetas que obtienes pues la iconografía no es muy clara, ya después es más fácil.

Espero poder jugarlo a 4 jugadores. Recomiendo este juego si a tu grupo le gustan los juegos familiares con algo de estrategia ligera.

So nice and clean; this is a really good game. Plays super quickly as each player can only do one thing per turn. 
I think the one minor thing that makes it so enjoyable is that everyone starts off with a different special power (City Council) tile. That gives it just enough variance and different direction among players that the game doesn't bog down into "optimal plays" and over-analysis.

Not sure what happened to my previous comments but I'm knocking this game down from 8 to 7.

PROS
-Rules explanation is light, play is quick, but the choices in timing give this game depth. There are turns where you want to do everything and you know your opponent may be gunning for the same thing. So, do you use a Middleman now or do you have a turn or two to recruit some Agents? Do you raise your guys up now so you can orchestrate a future play or do you need to use your last standing guy to place on a track? 
-Middlemen mechanic makes for some player-created chaos but controlled as you know where the Middlemen will end up next.
-City & Nobility Tiles mix the game up keeping it relatively fresh.

CONS
-Game seems like it hasn't been play tested well. In particular...
-Random dice placement seems unnecessarily random and out of place for a game that would want you to take it a bit more as a serious Euro.
-City Tiles are wildly unbalanced leaving an inexperienced or unlucky player off to a limping start while another player can route them from the get-go.
-Taking 2 Bishops or 2 Carriages at a time seems huge, especially if as in the rules, you can just sit on a purple space, spend a Bishop, and get two more Bishops.

In the end, it's a game that continues to be divisive and seems to underwhelm any gamers to whom I've introduced it. To make future plays go better, I have several house rules that are a must.

Enjoyable and fast paced game, with a lot of ways to score. Once you know it, most turns can take five seconds or so. Unfortunately all the special powers (depicted in hieroglyphics) can slow things down from time to time. Shame on the publishers for not including multiple player aides for these things... as it is players are forced to pass the manual constantly, marring an otherwise decent game. I hope to play more though.

Kind of a rondel turned on its ear; setup rules don't work well, but you may not notice right away. Instead of the current special ability distribution method, let the last player choose one from them all and then pass to the right, each successive player choosing one. There are only about 4 good options; the rest are decidedly inferior.

A well-constructed euro in which players have to get the right tokens to the right corner of the board at the right time. There's a certain brinksmanship in deciding what tracks to go for and whether you think you can get there before someone else who is also interested in them, and that's pretty interesting and well done. Ultimately, though, the game isn't really very memorable or exciting, and it's hard to put my finger on why. Hard to believe this is a Dorn game, too; it feels more like Ornella (not an an insult to either designer as I like both of them). (1 play)

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2015)

Il Vecchio is a gorgeous Euro game, the game board is beautiful and it looks very nice. The art is very good too.  It has some interesting decisions however I found the game to be a bit boring.

After reading the rules I thought it would be deeper but it isn’t. The playtime is generally short and it plays at a fast pace (its main appeal). Best with 3 players. 

I don’t have anything bad to say about Il Vecchio, but also, other than the production values, I don’t have anything good to say about it either. When I think about the game, one word pops up in my mind, AVERAGE game. It feels old somehow. 

The theme is boring for me, but some friends loved it.

Bottom line, Il Vecchio is an ok game that doesn’t do anything wrong, however it really fails to excite me and I will probably get rid of it. I would have loved the game when I began playing boardgames, but nowadays I want deeper games and Il Vecchio is too shallow for my taste. I almost never like a Rudiger Dorn game :/.

This is a very solid game that seems to get better with every play.  The quick down time is a plus and game play goes by fast.  Every game I have ever played has always been within just a few points (including one 44-43-42 game)  The iconology on the province and city tiles takes some getting used to (you will be referring to the cheat sheets quite often) but it's not a problem.  It's a game that makes you wish you could do a number of actions each turn but unfortunately, you will only be able to do just one.  Very strong game!

RATING: 6
Il Vecchio is an old-fashioned design up to using the most boring of all eurogame themes, renaissance families vying for power in Italy. On their turn, players choose one out of five actions all of which are rather simple. Rarely, I have played a non-trivial game where turns went as quick as here. There's only one breaking feature in the game which is the choosing of special tiles when players introduce one of their meeples on one of the region/Florence tracks. The iconography of the tiles is so diverse and not self-explicable that players will need much time to choose one (out of five or more) because of having to read up the meaning of each single tile. 
Gameplay itself reminded me vaguely of a Hansa Teutonica lite. It seems well-balanced as our scores were very close. Maybe too balanced? Once players know the available VP tiles it should be possible to play more focussed to generate the deciding efficiency advantage. Not quite a hidden gem from Essen 2012 but a solid game that's worth more attention than it gets.

Neat pick up and deliver game by Rudiger Dorn that plays in 75-90 minutes. I've found it plays well at 3 or 4 players, the action selection spots that move around the board is a neat twist. Planning to do multiple actions is often tricky and you need to predict what other players do in order to have your pieces in place to take advantage of the moving action selection spaces. Great game and it's sad this gem is out of print.

In order to compete you cannot find a strategy, or an avenue to victory, but you must simply create efficiency. You have to be mindful of your the scores of your opponents and find a way to get ahead. The problem with that is that you're really kind of all over the place, and generally the highest scoring options require you to invest in them else while you might be competitive, you will not win. 

In the end, I think there is a best way to play this game, and that's what puts me off; there is likely ONE best way, and it's whomever does it more efficiently that wins. Sadly, that's not my kind of game.

Kind of an old-school euro design. Not a lot new but still enjoyable. Collect stuff with your meeples and then position your meeples to cash that stuff in for points.

I like this kind of game for its simplicity given a group I play with each month. They aren't gamers and this will stretch their minds juuuuust enough while still being enjoyable for those that can tolerate more complex games.

There are variants that reduce randomness but I'm not sure it would increase the weight/meat-factor enough to not just choose a meatier game from the get go.

It's a nit but I wish the red middleman was really brown to match the spot on the board rather than the red that matches one of the player colors.

In the lighter category this is a very nice game. Quick turns, good player interaction and plenty of options to consider in your turn. So good decision making, I look forward to further plays. In the first games play is a bit slower because players need to refer to the rulebook every time they have to choose a tile. That will get better once players get to know and understand the iconography.

A fair, competitive euro, if not a bit uninspiring.

The best part about the game is it plays REALLY smoothly. The goals are clear, all the pieces and rules come together nicely and make sense, and the game play is very competitve and interactive. As a medium-complexity game, it is actually very good at what it does. The theme is sort of bland but I find it passable in this game. 

However, one minor problem is that the game is TOO smooth! With turns taking 15 seconds and the dynamic board state changing every turns, you sometimes feel that you have little control as you can't really plan ahead. This is not a very serious problem, however.

JASE. Everything works, everything's been done before. Choose one of your actions each turn ... put a new guy out, use a guy to pick up a resource, spend a guy to trade in resources for VP's. Be the first to spend guys and get majorities on each of the 5 scoring tracks. Collect some end game scoring tiles and fulfil their conditions. Maybe get some tiles early which give you bonuses each time you perform a certain action, and hope you get them early enough to give you enough advantage over the game to outweigh the opportunity cost of spending those resources/actions on straight VP stuff. Either specialise or diversify, both offer points. I'm sure it's all been very finely balanced ... and therefore who cares that much when you get to it. It's all fine, and I'm sure newcomers to the scene would enjoy it. I'd rate it a 6 except that it is a decent design. I've just played it already in many other guises and I expect more now.

A sort of area majority scoring and pick up and deliver  game with a really neat mechanic of gathering resources from "middle men" who quickly travel from town to town when they are used.  When you get resource tokens from one of them, you have to be mindful of where he is going and if that use will aid one of your opponents.  The mechanics are very "euro"-y, but the game is very well tied to it's theme, though the theme itself is not terribly exciting unless you are a fan of Italian history.  It is the closest thing I have seen to a Hansa Teutonica type game that actually works with 2 players.  I also feel similarities with Hansa when playing this game.  Putting together the right combination of City Council tiles which grant permanent bonuses also adds a level of strategy and fun.  Good game.

This game reminded me a little of soccer: your meeples stood at various points on the board, waiting for a marker to arrive so you could kick it to the next point to get resources.  I guess there's a little "camping the spawn point" in there too.  Eventually you have to move your meeples to the scoring tracks (where they get stuck), and the earlier you do so the more points they are worth, but then you have fewer meeples to play soccer.  I didn't really find this game to be incredibly compelling.  It was enjoyable, and there's nothing wrong with it, but it just seemed like there are better Euros out there these days.

In this game, you walk your meeples around a board, and take actions to collect resources when they reach a place with one of the middle men pawns. The middle man than moves to his next town on the board in a clockwise fashion. Points are gotten when you exchange your collected resources for placements on city tracks, and then there are majority points for each city. It plays smoothly, on your turn you have meaningful decisions to make, and there is some degree of tension in that you are competing with other players for the earliest and highest value spots. That being said, there's nothing about this game that really makes it stand out from the crowd.

RATING: 7
Initially appears more complicated than it is, but once played this is a fairly simple, yet strangely engaging game. 

Move & collect tokens that help you access the point scoring zones. The earlier you access these zones the bigger the point reward plus the longer you get to avail yourself of the associated bonus tile(s). It therefore has a slight race feel & the turn choices are simple enough to maintain this fast-paced feel.

Scoring has always seemed to result in fairly close finishes but I have no idea how someone gets close to the 100 on the score-track!

As I have come to expect from TMG, this is a promising protoype, not a finished game.  It desperately needs development from a proper developer.  It saddens me to see neat ideas ruined by a publisher that doesn't help the designer finish it off.

In the case of this game, the game is interminably slow.  You have use a bishop token for almost any action.  It takes an entire turn to net 1 bishop token.  So, you effectively take 1/2 an action each turn.  It takes 2-5 actions to actually accomplish anything, so the game just drags on.  Worse, there is virtually no interaction between players, so your turn is being fragmented (and thus the game slowed down) for almost not gain in depth or opportunity for interference.  This game is almost entirely an exercise in simple optimization.  It could have been much more.

Much of the game is about moving pawns around the map.  But you rarely move your pawns around the map.

In several cases, you are allowed to take any tile you want from a stack.  Every stack is slightly different, so you need to review a lengthy list of special powers to make the choice, but only gain a marginal benefit.  So, the game strongly inclines players towards pointless AP.

I think it could have been a 7/10 with one more overhaul from a decent developer, maybe higher.  As is, it's playable but not worth playing.

--Feb2013-- Intriguing pickup-and-deliver game, with a thin veneer of Renaissance Italy.  The synergies of the various powers one collects are important; and the timing precedences are cool.

Beautiful board, great components, fairly easy to learn, plays quickly - all things that make it a plus in my book.  Our first three player game was done in 90 minutes, including a rules explanation and going through what each of the tiles did. 

The take ONE action allows you to plan your turn  as others take their actions.  There are some free actions available, and as you place on the 5 different scoring tracks, you are rewarded with tiles that will give you the free actions or end of game scoring special tiles. 

End of game is a finite number of special tiles (Medici shields) being obtained - so while not a set number of turns, it is a set number of available tokens - across all scoring tracks, based on the number of players.

Il Vecchio --

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
Quick, painless and easy. 
Running for VPs, that's the game. 

The gameplay is smooth as you run in circles around the Florence trying to catch the fleeting items you need. And then you combine thess items as fast as you can and go into 5 scoring tracks which also grant you special actions. 

It seems very light, similar to Stone Age (yes, there are hieroglyphics on the tiles, but they're not drawn frequently, so the rules with tiles explanation will circle around the board as well). The area control part is not really that - it's not areas, but scoring tracks. What makes the game a nice time passer is that there's a lot of small "toys" that give game variation: special tiles (some are permanent benefits, some one time and some end game scoring). 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - bland bland bland and don't forget bland. Why do we need another game that's just okay(ish).

RATING: 7
Played 1 3P game. Il Vecchio is a quick, light to middle-weight Euro whuch is primarily a race to get family members into provinces of your choice. To do so, players will be moving family members around the board in order to collect resources from wandering middlemen. The mechanism of rotating middlemen is an interesting twist, since you have to consider where the middleman is going to next. The football analogy of kicking the middleman from one point to another is amusing, but it fits. Apart from the middlemen, there are also some secret scoring objectives and elements of area control - in other words, there are no other real outstanding mechanisms. As a result, Il Vecchio is a decidedly average and rather dry Euro.

This is sort of a worker placement game, where you move your workers around on the board to various locations where they collect resources, but only if the appropriate pawn is on that location. And if so, the pawn moves clockwise along a circuit to its next location. The paths were a bit hard for me to see -- I did NOT take advantage of the path in my initial worker placements. I wish the paths were marked better! It would mess with the aesthetics of the board, but having a faint colored line showing the circuit sure would be helpful!

In addition to collecting resources, other options on your turn include:
- recruit a new worker from Supply
- recover all your workers (when you collect a resource, you lay the token down)
- you can go to 4 locations where you place a worker for the rest of the game. You gain a single-use tile to help you during the game, a tile that gives you a bonus power (everyone starts with one of these as well), or a way to score bonus VP at the end of the game. Each worker placed also earns you VP, and may trigger an event (some spaces are marked); after a certain number of events, the game end is triggered: everyone gets one more turn, then you do the final VP tally.

It took me quite some time to "get" the way pawns move, and understand the timing required in the game. Pretty cool game, with nice art (though it could be more functional) ... hope to try it again!

RATING: N/A
Il Vecchio (Hall Games) is one of those old fationed kind of games, slightly remembering, maybe because of the box size and even the artwork, Hans Im Gluck kind of game*. You have a set colection in order to get special tiles that allow you to get VP. A simple recipe that has been working for more than a decade, now.

The theme is more than just a theme: Toscana, Firenze, Medici, Italia. It's been there, in games, since the dawn of times. It doesn't matter anyway, because, in the game play, it really doesn't. The artwork helps creating the ambience but that's all as the main mechanics are related to about anything you can imagine.

What we have here is mainly a worker movement game, not a worker placement as you execute the action not when placing a new guy on the board but when you move one. Players execute an action in a place where a Middleman is and he, clockwise direction, moves one step in the board, changing position. Useless to say that executing actions where the Middlemen are, is more interesting but, that's all. Nothing really new here and worse, nothing really elegant either.

The main issue I have with Il Vecchio is the fact that it doesn't seem polished enough. There are actions, special actions, that seem to have flaws. There are also certain special tiles that seem too much dried of ideas and lazy.
At this point, when I'm about to play a Hans Im Gluck kind of game, especially when the designer is Rudiger Dorn, I expect something more. 

Overall: on the plus side, the artwork. The downside must be the whole game. Players deserve more at this day and age. I won't be judging the option of making a pure euro game with no novelty at all. I will always want and need new pure good euro games. What I am complaining about is the lack of quality of the game itself with small important flaws that ruin the experience of play.

* Hans im Gluck serves to me as the best way to discribe a solid euro game. Il Vecchio is not one, in my opinion.

Interesting! The choices the players face are tempo vs. everything else. The early bird gets the points here AND gets first dibs on bonuses AND (eventually) can dictate the end game timing. My only dislike on first impressions is the multiple ways of scoring, (felt like a catch up concertina)though multiple plays will make it less opaque. The actions are swift and fairly simple and because its not a snowball type game (it looks like it from a rules read) everything leads to tempo efficiency. The theme is the usual Italian renaissance bollocks - would have been much better as a New York gangster family veccio = godfather.

2nd play - 2 of the four disliked it - Iconography not self evident, 'too dry'. 

3rd Play and its gone down 2 notches.

Players disperse their agents through renaissance Tuscany, gaining influence in the great Italian cities. While thematically dull, it's a smooth, enjoyable play experience. The board is a map of Tuscany, centered on Florence, with roads connected to other cities and to towns. Twenty of these towns allow access to five different resources; each of the resources has a middleman, who travels clockwise to the next of his four towns when he is activated.

Workers are scarce: most of the points come from committing them to one of the cities, after which they can no longer move. The spatial element is finely balanced with the set collection -- movement is necessary, cheap enough to allow for a lot of flexibility if a player is willing to pay, but just costly enough that it needs to be minimized.

A very smooth middleweight experience,  albeit one with a bit more hidden information than I would prefer.

After a couple of plays I don't feel like I know this game particularly well yet.  It has many familiar elements -- routes, majorities, bonus cards -- and at least a couple of ideas that were new to me -- the itinerant dispensers of goodies that you try to position your pawns to intercept, for example.  It was interesting to play and I'd play it again.

A mix of elements I love and elements I don't. The worker movement and how that ties in with the middlemen and activating locations is brilliant. Very interesting system which impressed me. Less impressive were the special power tiles that you receive from placing workers in cities. It felt like getting the right tile combinations decided the game. The tile that allows a person to place two workers instead of one seemed overpowered to receive as a starting power. Better knowledge of the game would probably fix that but it left a bitter taste.

Interestingly, there are only five possible actions you can take in Il Vecchio, so the game does not bog down in analysis paralysis and moves along at a good pace. Despite the limited action choices, there's plenty to think about here. The real trick is timing moves well and being efficient with actions. The verdict? I liked Il Vecchio more than a little, and would gladly play this if requested. However, the game has an uninspired theme (noble families in Renaissance Italy ... like we need more games with this theme) and likely lacks the depth I'd like to see for repeated play. The limited action choices also give each turn a bit of a "same-y" feel that's challenging but lacks excitement. In the end, I'd call this a solid game but not of the superior quality I want to see in my collection.

This is similar to Hansa Teutonica. If you like HT , then you have to play this. If you do not like HT, but you like Euro games, you have to play this.

Il Vecchio is a quick worker placement game that is a Euro down to it's drab brown heart.  The key mechanic of the game is that there are middlemen running around the board that allow you to grab followers (just think of them as cubes), money or special items.  You either have to place yourself ahead of these guys, chase them down, or use a special token to get your stuff.  Mostly when you take stuff your guys get worn out and lay down to take a nap and you have to yell really loudly later on to wake them up.  

You redeem stuff for points by placing guys in three outer regions or in two tracks in Florence.  You get special abilities or point goals when you do that.  There's all sorts of funky ways to score points.

This game is about getting special powers to build an engine and special goals to score points and then maximizing your use of the middelmen.

Anyone who enjoys Euros will find this a comfortable enough fit.  The rotating middlemen is a neat mechanic, but the game is your typical find a way to efficiently convert resources to points.   I enjoy that sort of thing, so this worked for me.

(Aug 2013 - After 1 3p game) - Had heard that it shared some similarities with Hansa Teutonica (One of my favorites) so it was on my to try list.

The available actions are rather easy to explain, the board is pretty clearly ID'd and the player aid cards help keep you focused on game end VP conditions.

Not a lot of downtime as you are deciding pretty quickly what to do.   There are a number of ways to score VPs which I truly enjoy.   Nothing seemed overly powerful.

Look forward to MANY future plays of this one.

Game play is too self-absorbed and the goals are too straightforward... there's a little interaction with the figures that move around but for the most part your game is focused on the special power/VP tiles you draw. In the end there's just not enough going on for all the moving pieces around that occurs, even if the game is quick paced. A series of micro turns with no drama. Disappointing from Dorn, whose designs usually tickle my fancy more than this.

My first Dorn game and second I will have played after the light Jambo, I chose this ahead of Goa and Genoa mostly for its slightly lighter weight and shorter play time. Also Goa is a game driven entirely by bidding and I have a bit of a thing about it at the moment, it just seems that every second game has some kind of bidding/auction mechanic in it and there are specific reasons why I can't have some of my groups constantly doing this.

The board is great, meeples fantastic and I'm keen to get this ruled and ready for play. I'm beginning to like the appeal of the 60 minute Euro so hopefully this will be a good one.

A solid 7 Euro from Essen 12.  Partial to me due to the Tuscany region where the game takes place.  Still has great bits and good choices to be made.

A perfectly serviceable Eurogame that I would have thought was really good 5 years ago.  But, now, it is sort of a themeless amalgamation of point gathering that typifies Euros.  Good game and well developed, but nothing memorable.

Nothing new, just move and make points somewhere.
but the rhtym is very very fast and this makes for a decent game experience. I am not looking for another play at Il Vecchio but if offered i likely won't decline.
the game is probably always the same but there are a couple of different strategies to pursue

Dice worker placement to start. City council tiles for player game bonuses. Pay gold to move worker or use carriage token. Collect resources at the middleman whose blown cover moves to another town. Buy corner province tiles for conversion benefits. Bring new family into the family business. Watch what the other player are doing to "interact" with their plans. Trigger Medici events usually player plan screwage. Florence action for the bonus tiles. Cheat sheet is flat scary. Seems like a solid game but it's a dry grind for us.

I would play this again, and hopefully not make the same errors I made in the first play of it. It wasn't amazing but it was enjoyable.

Ok the mechanics may remind you of something.
But the are so well combined that the game feels absolutely original.
Try to use the abilities offered by the tiles you purchase during the game as well as you can and you may build the winning combo.
The components and the board are just beautiful.
The replayability in my opinion is very high.
This game is definitely one of my new favorites!

This is an incredibly unusual game with such a very-usual-sounding theme.  I never would have guessed this would be so… interesting, and I'm a huge Dorn fan!  I had faith it would be quite good, but I just couldn't get excited about it until I was three turns into the game!

Fast pace, very little downtime.  Plays in a short time but still has some nice fluid gameplay.  Synergy of your tiles is vital.

I did the design/development work on this second edition. Believe me, I don't buy I all the games I work on, and have rated even fewer. But this one really came out right -- making it was every bit as fascinating as playing it, and playing it really hits so many right notes on my game table. I will keep working on Nemo's War Expansion Packs for everyone and stay busy with more cool stuff! :D

:thumbsup: The number of decision choices differs with each turn, and constantly challenges the player to find the optimal path.
:thumbsup: The level of tension slowly evolves from almost nonexistent at the start, to extremely pressing towards the end.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The dice play a significant role and despite some mitigation tactics, luck must be taken into account every turn.
[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]It takes a long time to fully understand and learn the various strategies, which can make it feel overly difficult.

:thumbsdown: Some storytelling is present, yet a rich narrative is often hidden beneath strategic decisions and separate mechanics.
:thumbsdown: The setup and teardown processes are quite involved and require a good deal of sorting and shuffling.

I slightly prefer Dawn of the Zeds, but Nemo's War (NW) provides a different feel that will get it played and is also much simpler to start playing after leaving it on the shelf for awhile. 

The wagering of resources as dice mitigation is the key mechanism here and that mechanism is surrounded by a lot of thematic flavor. 

If you simply look at the motives, you'd think that each play would cause the game to largely flow in a similar fashion. But this is not true; the motives cause a good amount of meaningful variation within the game. The various motives cause different levers to be pulled more often. This applies different pressure and tests you in different ways. Further, while the events at first glance appear to be a bit lacking in drama, they collectively apply pressures that add quite a bit to the variation between plays. It'll take a large number of plays before NW starts to feel repetitive. 

To succeed, you will need to walk a fine line between furthering your motive (e.g., scoring points) and maintaining some control over the chaos of the board. In addition, you'll need some intuition as to when you should start lessening control over the major oceans and instead ready for the finale card. Even if you make it to the finale card, you may not have played well enough for a good, let alone triumphant, result. And once you have a game end in failure, you'll realize there's a lot of subtle ways in which you can increase your point efficiency. 

Put simply, NW is well designed and, more importantly, very enjoyable. It took me a few plays with different motives to see how well designed it actually is.

This is a nice chunky solo game in a similar vein to Dawn of the Zeds. The gameplay consists of alternating drawing event cards, placing out threats on the board, and performing actions. The core gameplay centers around rolling dice and trying to pass a variety of tests. This involves risking certain resources, using valuable rerolls, and trying to set up favorable situations for your rolls. The game is challenging and of course features a heavy dose of luck. The artwork is beautiful and the production is solid overall(although the cards are surprisingly thin). I enjoy the variable scoring, the variable number of action points each turn, and the variety of scoring categories. 

Like Dawn of the Zeds I find that these types of games tend to drag a bit for me if I play them through straight, but I certainly enjoy setting them up and playing them over 3 sessions or so. This is a fun game if you're looking for a bigger solo game that will take 2-3 hrs, you're ok with a lot of luck, and you don't mind a challenge.

A solid, well balanced and strategically deep survival game. Lovely art, good components and dripping with theme. Unfortunately for me, I've learned I don't much like survival games and prefer games where there is a marked sense of progression eventually allowing the player to gain the upper hand over the AI, and Nemo is more the 'hang-on by your fingertips until you get to the finale' type. A brilliantly designed game that just isn't for me.

RATING: 7.5
This really is a neat game with a unique theme, but I think I need more plays (writing this after two plays) to give it a proper critique. My first impressions are not entirely positive though. This game ultimately runs on d6 rolls and drawing random adventure cards - in other words, your play of the game will be mostly run by the game itself. This is not to say that there aren't many (but certainly still limited) ways to mitigate unlucky rolls, but you WILL still fail crucial rolls even if you've sacrificed/bet/spent 2 or more assets to assist in passing a simple 2d6 "test". On the flip side, you will sometimes also get extremely lucky and pass very difficult tests with no help at all - this is just the nature of dice rolls. There are also abundant and difficult choices to be made concerning how to spend your available action points (I see this as a positive point), but even this, the number of action points you have available to spend in a turn, is mostly determined by dice rolls... This is a difficult game, but not for good reasons, in my opinion. It is difficult (or sometimes, in contrast, unusually forgiving) because the outcome of everything that you attempt to do (other than basic movement) is determined by dice rolls. To me, this was often more frustrating than enjoyable (like more frustrating than spending your whole turn trying to break down a door in Zombicide), and, to be completely honest, I found myself actually hoping to just lose so that the game would be over... =( It is very rare for something like that to happen with me, but it has somehow happened with Nemo's War. Although, there were certainly still moments when I was thoroughly enjoying the game. =]

Again, I'll probably give it at least a couple more plays before making my personal, final judgement of the game. For now, I cannot give it higher than 7/10. This is NOT to say that it is a bad game, but possibly just not the right game for me.

UPDATE: After a third play, it has grown on me a bit. Some of the frustration of my first two plays definitely came from unfamiliarity with the rules (especially the situations in which particular dice roll modifiers can be applied) and constantly having to reference the rules. Now that the flow of the game is quicker, it is more enjoyable. Up to 7.5/10.

I did not enjoy it. I completed an Explore run with a triumph. I have some major problems with the game design and game play itself.

First the good: High Quality components and beautiful artwork. The art on every card is interesting, the art of the rule book, and the cover, and the board is all very thematic and beautiful. I found myself thinking that if I ever make a board game I want this artist and I actually looked up who the artist was, something I normally don't do.

The bad: First I'd like to preface this by pointing out that I have played a lot of solo games and this is probably my least favorite of all the solo games I've played and that includes Solitaire. That sounds harsh. I was expecting a story driven experience, but this is not story driven at all. You get a motive, but regardless of your motive you're going to spend the game doing pretty much the same thing, fighting ship after ship after ship in boring battles. It was literally hours of just rolling dice and fighting ships. The battles involve me betting my crews lives against a ship, I roll a dice, either I win or I lose and that's about it. There's no tactical decision to the battle, its purely chance and whatever upgrades and modifiers you're willing to throw in. The whole game is purely random chance. Let me explain, every turn you draw a random adventure card from the deck and have to face a random test, event, or something you can keep for later. Then you roll two dice and ships randomly appear on the board, and there's sometimes a choice there like "Oh I can place it in this ocean or this one". Then I get my actions and you're thinking finally I get a choice. Even the number of actions you get every turn is random. Sometimes you get no actions. They call this a "lull turn" and if you've saved an action from the previous turn or are willing to sacrifice a valuable crew member you can still do stuff at a discount. But the number of actions is randomly decided by the throw of the dice. Your actions for the large part will be attacking ships whether your motive is "War" or not because the board fills up with ships so quickly, and if it fills up and no more can be placed, you lose. So even though your motive is explore or science you still will spend 80% of your randomly given actions fighting ships in battles that are decided by randomly thrown dice where the only decision you get to make is where to attack and what you want to bet: crew, hull, or nemo. Also on a side note, who the hell designed the score track. Its terrible, there are seriously 20 little tokens on this tiny track and they inevitably all end up stacked. Its very fiddly because I have to move these every single turn up and down. Since they are all stacked I'm constantly unstacking and restacking them. Halfway through I just gave up on the track. At the end of the game I arranged all the little tokens based on my accomplishments to realize once all the tokens were in place I still had no idea what my score was because I had to now add up these tokens on the little track. It would've been much simpler to have ONE token and one track from 0-99, when you flip the token over it says 100, then there'd be another token that says 200 and on the other side 300. Example: I gain a wonder treasure, Awesome that's worth 7 points because I'm Explore motive, I move track up 7. What's so hard about that? 

Summary: The game feels like gambling at Craps, I'm just rolling dice and betting stuff I shouldn't. Except the game takes several hours instead of just 30 minutes if I'm feeling lucky. There are many solo games that are actually strategic and not completely random. This one, while beautiful was very lazy design and not enough thought was put into the actual game play.

Physical components and art far exceeded my expectations. 

Gameplay is fantastic.  Just finished my first game and was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I got a Triumph (280 VPs) but just as easily could have lost to an Imperialist Victory had any of the last few ship placement rolls gone slightly differently.  Lots of ups and downs and tough decisions the whole time with an eye always on the victory conditions and the clock.

Quite an adventure and a deep strategy game too, the people who worked on this game are the ones who got the Triumph.  Mechanics, art, rules, for once a game lived up to its hype.  This is something special.

RATING: 8.8
This is the non-Euro soloable Euro I've been looking for. It has the resource gathering and subs (get it?) out worker placement for action point allowance, but make no doubt--you are playing a Feld-like point salad. Searching for treasure gains you 1-7 VP, inciting uprisings gives you 3-6 VP, sinking ships gives 1-10 VP, etc. It's complex, but easy to set up and play. 
I am pretty bad at it after a few plays.

Update:
Replayability is there, when one does not play the game more than once or twice a month. That's good enough in my book. Very good solo game, this might go to 9 eventually.

---

There are several clever bits in Nemo's War. The spatial element, combined with the ship placement tactics and attack attempts forms an interesting ongoing puzzle. The action award mechanism combined with the changing dice pool is novel and also rather interesting in itself, as it influences ship placement and also declaring a lull term or not. The four individual scoring recipes result in different strategies. And then you have the large event deck that consists of many more cards that you need in one go. The production is top notch, which helps the narrative, and of course, who doesn't have a sweet spot for Jules Verne in his heart... 

Not sure of its replayability to be honest, despite the variability in its event card deck and scoring recipes.  But all in all, quite an interesting and rather enchanting solo game.

Kickstarter version - A beautifully produced game. Also a typical VPG solo game i.e. difficult  to win. The team has captured the theme of Jules Verne's 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea really well, with adventure cards that reflect scenes from the book, and four different motives for Nemo . However, in this game, whatever the motive, there are more ship sinkings! (You have to keep the seas clear of ships. If you cannot place a ship in an ocean, it is one of the conditions for a loss to occur). It takes a bit longer to play than an average VPG States of Siege game, but it is very involving and draws you in and can become very tense.  This is a wonderful addition to any solo gaming collection.

I enjoyed playing this immensely. I'll readily admit that I haven't actively looked for single player games, but this will definitely sate my appetite for them for the very foreseeable future! 

The different ways I can play when using the different motives, as well as the available upgrades and events switching up each game makes this a very replayable game to me. I haven't tried the multiplayer mode yet, but for me, I have quite a few games that can fit that bill if need be, and not nearly enough that I can enjoy on my own.

A solo game where the player is in command of the Nautilus, and roaming world's oceans trying to amass a victorious score.  Shipping appears each turn, and slowly clogs up the ocean boxes on the map, and the Nautilus then plows on spending a meagre supply of action points fighting, exploring, inciting rebellion, and when time and situation allows, resting and refitting the inevitable damage you will take.  Points are scored for about ten different things, but they can be weighted differently depending on Captain Nemo's motive in the game, which could be one of four different things.  Wonderful game that, when boiled down, is simply a game of "risking" against die rolls, but spending resources to mitigate that risk.  Early days, but this is a glorious game that had me hooked.  The rules appear long and complex, but really this is straightforward stuff, and incredibly well thought out.  Production is glorious.  One of the best solitaire games I've played in over 40 years in the hobby.

Embraces the theme and excels.  Many moving parts, which lead to multiple paths to victory (or defeat).  Rules an easy read, nothing overly complicated, on par with VPG's more involved State of Siege games.  Components are top-notch.  Rating based on solo experience, have not tried the co-op game.

What an extraordinarily and lovingly well-crafted solitaire game on all levels.  The narrative/story-telling component of this game is breathtaking (with the theme shining so brightly through the gameplay), the components are gorgeous (it amazes me that each ship is unique -- wow!), the rulebook (and all the information on the board) is excellent, and all of the available options (e.g., motives, difficulty levels, win levels, optional rules) certainly contribute to what looks likely to be remarkable long-term re-playability. 

Then there's the brain-burning wealth of tactical and strategic choices available each turn (with so many factors inter-linking and needing to be considered), all of which seem to ripple out, interact, and have a thematically meaningful longer-term impact as the game unfolds. And this is woven together with the excitement of the dice-rolling component beautifully, with all the various ways of mitigating outcomes (and all those difficult choices weighing risks/benefits, pros and cons, probabilities) keeping you from feeling at the mercy of those so often fickle dice.

Sometimes I find myself just pausing to admire the board with the game in progress, which immediately pulls me right in (..."so we're currently in the North Atlantic, with the Nautilus upgraded with Hydro-Drive and that Monstrous Design, those 2 warships cruising not far off, rumors of hidden treasure nearby, our crew a little worn down, decent winds allowing us 4 actions... hmmm... what shall we do next?").

This game is a true solitaire gem.  Many thanks and kudos to all involved in its design and production.

Very impressed with this game. Between this and VPG's other title I own, Dawn of the Zeds 3rd Edition, they're two for two with me. Once again, this is dice strategy done right with some very clever mechanisms. 

First off, you choose your “motive” each game (science, exploration, anti-imperialism, war!) which determines your victory conditions and influences how you play the game. The way action points are determined is to roll two dice and subtract them for your actions this turn. A 0 is a special lull turn and sometimes you may want this. This sounds mild but it’s fun to not know how many actions you’ll get each turn; you may save only one from turn to turn. 

The way tests are resolved is my favorite of any dice adventure game I’ve ever played. You have three resources – Nemo, Crew, Hull – and each offers a +X dice modifier if you so choose. Thing is, you’re basically wagering that modifier. If the test succeeds, the resource used stays at its current level. If you fail, it drops a level. So now maybe your Crew only gives you +2 instead of +3. So now you have to add fixing the morale of your crew to your task list.

You move around the board choosing to destroy other ships, incite rebellions, and search for treasure. The deck of cards is stacked into three acts. Each act adds more dice to be rolled and more ships to the board. The arc of tension increases as you get more powerful with upgrades and obtained modifiers but the game board fills up with ships. Too many ships and you lose so you have to keep clearing the clutter while using precious action points to move and accomplish your goals. 

I can’t help but compare both of the VPG games to another dice adventure game I own, Eldritch Horror, and note how superior they are. There’s so much more player agency in the VPG games. I like EH because I’m a Lovecraft fan but I can’t help but wish FFG would make it more strategic and sophisticated as these games. This is a clever design with good variability and replayability. I'm very impressed.

If you like heavier, solo games with a rich theme, this is for you.

Played once just to get my bearings and understand the system.  Boy this is a difficult game that I really like.

Not really knowing the strategies I did a little bit of everything, but ended up in default from an Imperialist victory.  In hindsight I should have been better at taking out weak non-warships fairly quickly to get them off the board.

I'm not too familiar with the source material other than at some time I'm sure I've watched the Disney movie.  I don't think it really mattered as everything you are doing was fairly thematic.

RATING: 7.5
A very thematic solo game with a lot of interesting and innovative mechanisms. I love how you can risk your resources to manipulate the dice rolls instead of just giving them up, I wish games like Eldritch Horror used a similar mechanism.

I also love how you can use treasure for dice manipulation or keep them for points.  Same with the decision what to do with the ships you sink. There is some clever thinking behind this game.

On top of that the art is fantastic and fits the theme like a glove. It's a bit heavier and longer than I'm used to for my solo games, but I really love playing it.

This game runs a tight ship! Playing cooperative is a blast, but it's a tough game. You really have to balance out what you're doing based on which of the 4 motives you played.

After all of the adventure games I've played, I think I've finally found it. The one. I'm only scoring a 9 for now because I'd like to raise it in the future as I play further.  This is a masterfully designed, rendered, and produced game. I'm floored.

I've never ever experienced a  game which is so thematic. NW is a true masterwork: I'm so happy I pledged it on KS. I don't care if and when I lose: it just means experience and tactics learning for next games. Playing a game to NW is always exciting.
Dice roll, event cards, ships drawing add, of course, that surprise effect which sometimes can be frustrating, but - come on! - every naval country is looking for your Nautilus!
To me, the only flaws are about materials: the plastic inserts and the miniature, which could have been metal. 
Oh, what a game!

I'm play testing the second edition right now, and I swear to you, if you're a fan of solitaire games, this is just about the Holy Grail.  Here's why:

- it's simple to learn
- it's not fiddly at all
- there's a great deal of replay value
- the Motives (4 to choose from) vastly change your game
- it manages randomness very, very well

I've been waiting for this game for a few years, and now that I've played it, I know it's well worth the wait. 

Six games in, and I have yet to win.  Closest yet has been a Science motive game with 168 points, but an Imperialist Victory (defeat condition where there is no room to add a Warship) - and with just 2 cards to get through, including the Finale card.  Oh, so close!  

This is definitely rewarding repeated plays and accumulated experience. 

Received my KS copy of the game.  Quality of production is amazing.  What at first feels like a game with a lot to remember quickly becomes a fluid gaming experience.  The only complaint I have is I wish I didn't have to flip through the book to see how setup is different for each of the 4 motives, but that is an extremely minor complaint.  This is an incredible game with enough challenge to keep you playing it for a long, long time.

I'm only half way through the first game, but this has been considerable fun. I greatly enjoy group games, especially heavier 2-3 hour games. This scratches an itch I didn't know I had and gives me something enjoyable to do between game nights.

Update: Well, I lost. Only 3 cards left in the draw deck, but I was overrun by those danged imperialists. Next time I'll send more of those billowing buckets to the bottom of the sea. This explorer needs room to work!

Great game. I'm sticking with my 10 rating.

Best solitaire game out there for a somewhat 'heavy' game. Heavy on dice roll and to some extent push your luck (mixed with modifiers). Almost every step in the game is a decision making potentially leading to better course of game, or otherwise disaster. If you manage to survive through play without being defeated, your score determines the level of success.
Played this twice so far. First game was unable to finish (due to no fault of gaming). Second game took 3 hours (can be shorter once you know the rules), with defeat.
You must balance your actions, although concentrating on specific goals can yield higher score.
There is enough in this game for a replay value.
To me, the theme is spot on, and all actions jive thematically. Being familiar with the novel definitely contributes to the atmosphere. I highly recommend reading the book as it will help immerse you in the theme, and you will understand the reasoning why Nemo is doing what he is doing.
I mentioned at the start that this game is ‘heavy’ meaning you cannot compare it to let’s say Friday, which is another phenomenal game, but not at the same level of complexity, nor length of play.
Bottom line -a keeper!

2017-08-17 - 6 - Great artwork and the theme coming through, but unfortunately the game is pretty repetitive, especially for its length. It is for most part just chucking 2d6 to see if you pass a test or not, while exerting one of three ship resources. You can do quite a lot of things in this game, but you do them all in the same way. I much more prefer Robinson for solo adventure game, but maybe I will give this one another try.

08-03-2017 - I've only played one 4 turn learning game so far, but wow, this game is a lot of fun.  It might be important to point out I played 2p co-op, haven't tried solo yet (and honestly probably won't).  On that note, 2p, they did a good job at breaking the responsibilities up between players to make each feel involved.  It's very random with dice rolls and card draws, but there are gambling mechanisms to augment your dice rolls that result in real thought and choice going into your turns.  Underneath the main game driving mechanics there are ship upgrades to be had (seems you use about 4 or 5 out of 10 for variability), treasures to hunt that might help or actually hurt you, movement and battling, great art work, all in all just a good time.  Once you get the rules down the game moves pretty quick and isn't that complicated.  There are a lot of situational rules that change based on the current game conditions, and those can be hard to keep straight, and honestly that might be my only negative complaint.  But even with that said, the game board does a lot to help you keep some things straight with turn flow and such printed on it.  I thought I'd like Nemo's War (that's why I, you know, bought it) but I was actually pretty surprised with how much I really do.  Can't wait to play again!  9 for now, we'll see.

Note to self: Solitaire game. After half a video review, seems long but interesting mechanics and gameplay. Lot of replay value, the random number of actions is a bit weird, but I guess when you roll more dice, it's not much an issue.

The resource management is a bit weird like resources and expandable characters. But I guess variants could be designed to use them differently.

I have to say that this game feels pretty unique, I have not see anything similar out there. It should really worth playing it. But it could be pretty long to play.

These are temporary initial thoughts as I play for the first time. In case I forget...

Very thematic to look at. The whole presentation really gives you a sense of being Nemo strategising at his desk in his cabin. I don't understand why this is listed here as more weighty than Zulus on the Ramparts though (the only other Victory Point game I've tried) as it really doesn't feel like it. The synergies of the cards in Zulus seem much more multi-layered. Here you just reveal a card, do what it says and for the most part move onto the next one. That is a little bit of a disappointment as I was really looking for something one step up from ZotR in complexity, but I'm not sure this is it. Perhaps the depth will reveal itself more as I explore (bad puns for emphasis). That said, I'm enjoying it a lot, and certainly more immediately than Zulus. I understood the flow of play very quickly, which is refreshing. The manual is excellent. They've ditched the antiquated war game manual approach which was present in Zulus with numbers and decimals to indicate "Cases" and Sub-Cases" and "...the second Subcase of the first Case of the fourth Rule"! ( I kid you not, that was a direct quote...). Here we have rules written by humans for humans. So much better!

On a more superficial note, I would say that the price is pretty hefty for such a relatively light game. I'm sure it's due to a combination of small publisher and their highest quality components to-date, but still, they are asking for a small king's ransom, no question there. That said, I'm personally glad that VPG have done away with the sooty pieces from their previous up-graded editions. That smell could strip the nose hairs clean off!

The different motivations gives each game its own strategy and the flavor text on events and prologues really put you in the Nautilus with Nemo and crew. The actions can get a bit repetitious and you won't enjoy this if you dislike dice, but I recommend it for any solo adventure gamer.

First six plays are with one of the final Beta Prototypes of the game, produced by VPG.

[u]23-Nov-2017[/u]:  (same comments as Nemo 1e, see below for 2e comments) This game is based on the novel, 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. You play the role of Captain Nemo and command his vessel, The Nautilus, through the oceans of the world, fighting enemy ships, inciting anti-imperialism, and discovering treasures & wonders of the seas.

What makes this game unique is that there are four distinct paths Nemo may take, each with their own set of VP conditions. So depending on which way you go, Treasures may be worth more to you, or perhaps you are looking to sink as many enemy ships as possible, and so on.

There is a lot of dice rolling, which I normally don't tend to enjoy, but here, the narrative of the game really shines and overcomes this for me. Even when the dice aren't seemingly going your way, thematically it comes through with Nemo's struggles with his own mental state. There is quite a bit of a push-your-luck element as well. When rolling dice, most of the time, you may "gamble" one of your resources (the Crew, the Nautilus, or Nemo's psyche itself), to improve your odds. This, of course, could lead to a Tragic Loss if these resources fall too low, but it all adds to the theme and narrative flow of the game.

[u]Nemo 2e[/u]:  While the overall experience is very similar to the original edition, many updates and tweaks have been made to this new version.  Please go read my detailed reports [thread=1471322]HERE[/thread] to get my complete view.  But to summarize, the gameplay has been advanced to allow the player more choices and more influence on the outcome of the game, while still remaining true to the original's push your luck core system.  The production, graphic design and artwork have seen major upgrades to the original.  Some things remain the same.  There is still a lot of dice rolling.  A lot.  And I feel combat is still a major action in the game, no matter which path you take.  Although, it has lessened a bit for some paths.

As a whole, though, I love the sense of adventure and storytelling in Nemo's War. It's why I enjoyed the original, and it's what I'm most interested in for the new edition. I actually get annoyed with myself when I start to focus too much on the endgame VPs during a session. I just want to ride that narrative wave from start to finish.

Enjoyable solo game, if a little dry and mechanical for my tastes. I was actually pretty intimidated going in after seeing the rule book in the 3rd edition of Dawn of the Zeds, but this one was actually pretty easy to digest. They took the Alea route of putting examples along the sides of each page, which helped immensely. Ultimately, however, I still think Zeds is the best game in VP Games' catalog, and arguably the best zombie game on the market. Rather than score via victory points, like you do here, I prefer the central objective of survival. Nemo's War was fine, but nothing that I feel needs to be experienced again.

[b]Nemo's War (second edition)[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I was able to play through a solo game of Nemo's War at my buddy Mat's house [i](he taught me the game as I played which was nice)[/i]. I was playing the game on the normal difficulty and chose the explorer scenario. There is so much going on in the game that I am just going to focus on some highlights from my game play.
 
+ Story: I read every bit of flavor text and really enjoyed how my game unfolded.
+ Relatively intuitive rules: there is a lot going on in the game, but between the rule book and board it was easy to play and find any rules that needed clarification.
+ The board is well laid out and contains a lot of the info you will need to play the game once you are familiar with the rules. It is a large board, but there isn't any wasted real estate.
+ Dice are used for everything, from placing ships, combat, resolving challenges and most importantly determining how many action points you have to spend. The random nature of dice make sense thematically and add to the tension in the game. You may have wild swings of fortune, but it makes sense based on the source material.
+ Action points and dice: I found this system to be well balanced. I had an inordinate amount of turns with only one action point to spend and yet somehow I managed to score 252 points [i](thank you steam torpedoes)[/i]. I really enjoy games that are punishing and force you to plan out your strategy and use your actions wisely.
- Play time vs. investment: This is my one negative because I'm not sure how many times I'd play a 2 - 3 hour solo game, no matter how engaging it is. It is a huge time commitment, but this really boils down to personal preference. 
? Replay: I'm really not sure at this point, it really depends how you look at the game. There are a lot of card which all have different flavor text and missions to undertake, but on the other hand the game mechanics aren't that varied or deep and may begin to lose some luster after multiple plays. I think the replay value found in Nemo's War is heavily dependent on your continued enjoyment of connection between story and mechanics, I don't think the mechanics of game play alone are enough to drive continued play.

These are my initial thoughts after one play and could change quite a bit with further plays. For now I'm content that I got to play a game of Nemo's War and time will tell if I get that opportunity again. Right now I don't think I could justify adding it to our collection because the opportunities I have to play a solo game of this length are so few and far between.[/i]

Jeu conçu pour jouer solo, mais avec une variante coop.  Excellent jeu solo.  Un croisement de Robinson et de jeux de guerre.  Encore meilleur si on a déjà lu 20 milles lieux sous les mers.  Beaucoup de roulement de dés, mais qu'y peuvent être modifiés.  Plusieurs choix intéressant.  Les 4 motivation de capitaine Nemo change l'approche du jeu complètement.  Longue partie.  J'adore.

[floatleft][ImageID=3627893][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
Nemo's War is a good solitaire game that plays relatively quickly. I really like the artwork and the theme is nice.

[b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
First and foremost the components of this game are outstanding. The artwork and colors just pop. The materials are extremely high quality. I especially love all of the ship markers and the color choices they made because they look really sharp on the board. I am very pleased with this KickStarter outcome. 

The degree of difficulty feels about right for a solitaire game. The game presents a challenge but it doesn't feel insurmountable. I appreciate how the game starts off gradually but the difficulty ramps up significantly towards the end of the game. You go from being the scourge of the entire seas to feeling as if the entire world just wants you dead. There are so many ways to lose this game immediately and the threat of outright losing feels palpable towards the later turns of the game. 

The action points in this game are very limited so deciding on what is most important to accomplish can present a difficult decision. You need to manage a number of different things, mainly keeping ships from getting out of hand in all of the oceans, but you will only be able to accomplish a fraction of what you want to do. I never felt like I was agonizing too long over one single turn or action but there are some occasions where I really had to weigh my decisions. The entire game really feels like the sum of all the actions.

After finally groking the game it plays relatively quickly. I found my game sessions lasted easily less than two hours including setup and tear down. This is a nice, quick game that I can play in an evening.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I am not opposed to dice rolling in games. The fact that Nemo's War relies heavily on dice rolling for all of the checks in the game does not bother me. What I dislike about Nemo's War is that risking ship's resources for favorable die roll modifiers seems like it is required to pass nearly all challenges. I found that not risking resources was the exception not the norm. I like the mechanism but the heavy reliance upon it took away from it.

After finally completing the game without suffering an outright loss I was disappointed that my victory only counted as "inconsequential" according to Epilogue. This left a very sour taste in my mouth. I thought I had done well during my game and I was pleased with my performance only to be slapped in the face by the Epilogue. I understand that the degrees of victory are there to make you want to strive for higher goals but in the end it just felt off-putting. 

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I am very happy that I KickStarted this game. Nemo's War plays quick enough that I can get an entire game in easily in one night. I think I rate this slightly higher as a solitaire because of the ease of which I can get this to the table. I would probably rate this lower if this same style game were presented as a multiplayer experience. It's a good game but it's not great. I enjoy it.

I wish this was longer.  Success also feels a little too dependent on the dice, but it's possible I'm just bad at it.

You'll fail most challenges without risking resources, but the penalty for risking resources and failing is really rough.  Beautiful art.

Played at: Tonys

Played coop mode with Tony and we had the science mission scoring 233pts, 17pts short of a moderate victory. Good game and you are continuously pushed on what decisions to make, what resources to risk and what ships to take out. Got to say Nemo is pretty blood thirsty individual with us racking up at least 25 ships destroyed at that was just a science mission. War encourages even more destruction.

It is really hard to make a satisfying truly solo game but the designer did it with this one.  I watched the original movie then played the game and that added a deeper richness.

Lots of things to do.  The game is controlled by dice rolling but you have tons of things to do and how you do them determines how the game gets played.

The board works perfectly, excellent components, excellently laid out, top quality production.

I had a great time playing the game.

I was happy to find the hype was justified with this game. Tense moments and tough decisions abound. My last game I was one open sea space away from losing on my last turn. Also, the different Motivations offer for drastically different play styles and makes the game seem so different. It's a beautiful game, too. My only component quip is the resource markers for Nemo, Crew, and Hull. Luckily, there are some plans for 3D printed markers that look outstanding!

In spring 2014, I  was lucky enough to be on the playtesting team for this extraordinary game. The first edition was a charming and engrossing experience, but this realization brings Nemo's War to its rightful place as one of the best solitaire board games of all time. Fans of the novel will not be disappointed: Verne's Nemo comes alive as the adventure is unveiled one card at a time, and strategy lovers who skipped the book will likewise find the game an immersive challenge.     This one earns a permanent place in my collection.

This second edition is a solid hit to its target. It's smooth to play, easy and clear to learn, has a great aesthetic appeal between its story and presentation and isn't too fiddly for the tactical puzzle it presents. As I gain more experience, Nemo's War is gradually revealing the bones of its puzzle structure, which has some depth that nicely takes the space formerly occupied by the novelty of the first few games. 

I didn't have the pleasure of experiencing the first edition but am very glad I've acquired the second. As a bonus, the marketing plan in place for the future - a series of 7 small, inexpensive boosters - appeals to me and fits my circumstances well (busy life.) So far, at least, Nemo's War draws me back to the table very well and leaves me satisfied with each playthrough.

Must get this, before their print run sells out, and I suspect they'll have few unspoken for copies by the time they come. I think late April or sometime in May might be last time to order.

Pricy, but narrative/story, which makes being longer worth it. For that, I will go longer, a bit. And it's Verne, Steampunk, blinged out the wazoo like it might never be again, gemmy bits.

Still, if you don't get me this, and it's rather over the requirement, please let me know, if your package doesn't come before they cut off orders for this.

I finally got my hands on this after missing out on the KSer and man, was it worth the wait.  It provides you with a full solo game experience in a reasonable time frame (which it doesn't lie about).  I'm not normally a solo gamer, but this one is never leaving my collection.  Mixes, push your luck, adventure, and TOUGH choices with a constant pressure of the encroaching Imperialist ships.  Can't recommend it enough.  This could go up to a 10 with repeated plays.

The Good:
1.  Lovely graphic design, nice components, doesn't take up too much table space. Love how all the key rules are on the board itself.  Caveat:  wish the world map was larger, just so that I could actually SEE it.  As is, I barely have a sense of where I am in the world as Nemo.
2.  Quick to set up and clean-up.
3.  Nice play-time.  Long enough to give you an "epic" feel, but short enough that you can fit an entire game into an evening.
4.  The Adventure deck:  gives each turn a nice narrative component, a good mix of skill-checks, events that help you, events that suck, and missions to fulfill.
5.  Simple, quick combat (which happens a lot).
6.  Managing notoriety is interesting.
7.  The pressure of the game noticeably increases, providing an epic conclusion and sense of accomplishment if you even survive to the end.  Watching the map fill up with stronger and stronger warships is intimidating.
8.  Solid replayability - although I'm not entirely convinced every game will feel substantially different.

The Bad:
1.  Not sure how I feel about my action point allowance being determined by roll of the dice.  Turns where you only get 1 action are no fun.
2.  You roll 2d6 to resolve everything.  Sure, there are modifiers, and they certainly can make all the difference - but every turn, you're rolling 2d6 for success or failure, and that's how the "narrative" of the game unfolds.  It's perhaps even more exhausting than all the skill-checking in Arkham/Eldritch Horror.
3.  So much effort went into the art behind each of the ship tokens - and yet, there's so little to actually differentiate them.  Given that combat is such a big part of this game (managing ship density), I maybe wish that there was more to it - special weapons, abilities, maneuvering bonuses, etc., etc.  I don't know - this would obviously slow down the game enormously, but there's just not a lot of complexity/tactics/strategy to warfare in this game.
4.  For a game with a lot of narrative hooks, I don't really get drawn into being Nemo here.  It feels too mechanical, esp. the ship token management business.  Nemo's Motive helps by focusing your strategy which feeds into a particular story.  But, for example, uprising are just black cubes placed on the board which have no real impact on gameplay or narrative.

Current Score:  an 8 currently, but will drop if every play feels too similar.

2017: 8.5.  Want to play more before I write up more thoughts, but the art is incredible, the gameplay thematic and I love the narrative feel of the game.

The heavy reliance on dice mechanics can be cruel but I'm ok with that, most solitaire games require some element of randomness and chance, and here you can see good and bad luck as just part of the story you're telling/playing.

Oh my goodness. Rating this a 9 after one play, but I can see it going up to 10 later. While reading the rules I got very concerned about the amount of "roll to resolve" moments in a typical turn. But then I played and WOW: "Nemo's War" is immersive and narrative-rich, with layered strategy and multiple paths to pursue -- and much of that "roll to resolve" is tempered with stressful luck mitigation decisions that could pay off (or cost you even more). Sure there are many moments where a bad die roll can hit you in the gut, but after one play, I found it to be just the right amount of brutality and unpredictableness, which makes it even more critical to get my long-deliberated decisions right. The concept of alternative "Nemo's Motives" changes the win conditions significantly and seems like this will have a lot of replayability for me. Time to get back to another game!

There's nothing wrong with the game, but it felt like rinse and repeat for a really long time with very little in the way of progression. Yes, you gain bonuses and treasures, but these often get used up just to keep you in the game and to mitigate for the huge amount of dice rolling. And boy is there a lot of rolling. By the end of my first and only game, I really wanted to play Eldritch Horror just to see some story progression, and feel more involved in the game. Being an investigator and fighting back monsters is far more fun than being a tyrannical submarine commander.

Sold July 2017, after first play. EH is more fun.

An absolute gem of solo gaming. It's rare enough that good solo titles come out at all, let alone that they're given such a loving treatment. It's a dice game, but it has some unique ideas about how to manipulate the odds, and even lets a "bad" roll land as a relief now and then. Wonderful.

Didn't grab me in the way I thought it would.  One reason is that the story elements come and go so fast that I lose track of the narrative -- things seem rather "zoomed out" and abstracted, so I'm focusing on game mechanics rather than theme.  The other factor is that the victory conditions as written seem to demand a very deliberate, min/max play style -- I read somewhere on BGG that to finish with a winning score one needs to generate, on average, 10 VP a turn, and knowing that detracts from my enjoyment.  I could play for the experience, or a "moral victory," but it doesn't quite feel right to me.

Very curious about the multiplayer, though -- especially since a friend has vouched for it being a fun experience and not just a tacked-on addition.

The theme, definitely the theme. Jules Verne was my favorite author when I was young and his stories fascinate me up to this day. After unbixing: component quality not at Dawn of the Zeds level by far. Flimsy cards, punching cardboard felt squishy and the insert needed some work so that you can actually remive cards from it. First play shows a very sandboxy and very harsh and unforgiving game where the sandbox is more of a distraction, because you have to hunt for your VPs. Tons of fun and the setup has loads of variability, so I expect loads of replayability. Setup is a bit involved, but not too bad if you get it orbanized. Loved it so far.

I'm rating this a 6 for now, as my first game was insanely hard and I played the suggested "Explore" motive on easy. I don't think I was unlucky in my rolls, nor do I think I made too conservative or too rash decisions (betting resources, etc.). So it's tough to see how this could be fun in the future if it is going to be so unforgivingly punishing. Not saying I won't revisit - just saying with an incredible number of unplayed games in my collection, I won't be running back to it for that second chance.

This is one fine solo game. Between the events, slow rise in difficulty, treasure hunting, and multiple fail conditions, players will always feel the pressure. Chris Taylor designed the perfect system for the novel, and this gorgeous 2nd edition gives the game the treatment it deserves.

Strong theme but everything else flops. Each turn is a question of which boring actions should I take that aren't really necessary cause I'm in no immediate danger and the danger comes from random events or bad dice rolls that can result in big losses that can be mitigated by spending victory points, woo hoo. The game is mostly spend waiting for it to end while neither you, or the 'opponent' accomplish anything.

This is a fun way to burn an afternoon. There are a bunch of mechanics in this game that you have to manage which can make your first playthrough rather daunting. My first playthrough took me about 3 and a half hours to finish as I had to keep jumping back to the guide. That being said I had a BLAST playing it. There are a total of 20 different endings which consist of small paragraphs of story flavor on how you did which I find really neat. 

If there is one thing I would say this game needs, it would be more adventure cards. There is a deck of cards it comes with and you shuffle them and end up only using like 31 total cards in the deck for each adventure and the rest go in a separate pile for another part of the game. So you do get some variety on a per game basis but I feel like you will end up seeing alot of the same cards over and over as you try to get all those different endings. 

There is a lot of chance based dice rolling BUT you can mitigate that by betting a certain number of your crew, yourself (Nemo) and your Hull of your ship. That is an interesting mechanic to risk those very valuable components but it can pay off. I feel there are enough ways to mitigate some of the bad dice rolls so you can succeed that the game really gives you complete choice on whether you win or lose. You just have to know how to properly manage those decisions. 

An example of the previously mentioned decision making skills, I kept spending the treasure I found to improve my dice rolls through out the game so I would succeed everytime. Well at the end of the game when I was tallying up my final score to determine which ending I would get, I was ONE POINT away from getting the better ending. If I would have just not spent a single treasure on a dice roll I would have gotten it. Now if the unknown chance of the ending you are going to get isn't your thing, the game also comes with this little chits that you can use to dynamically keep track of your score while you play and a spot on the game board to place them. I prefer the unknown excitement at the end personally. 

I haven't delved into the co-op multiplayer yet, I wanted to get a few more playthroughs in by myself to fully learn the game mechanics before I pull someone else in. All in all I spent about $75 on this and I was worried about the value considering it was marketed as a single player experience. I have to say after 1 and a half plays by myself, it was totally worth it as I am eager to get back in and try for one of the other many different endings.

I have never felt more immersed in a game before. This game is a decision heavy and a strategic masterpiece. It's one of the most incredible games I have ever played. Maybe it's because I've never played anything quite like it, but I am in awe of what this has done to elevate my love for solo gaming. It's almost perfect.

2 plays on beginner and hybrid beginner/medium, explore and anti-imperialism motivations, both success.

This game appeals to me greatly.  

• The pressure mechanics are so cool, and allows for really interesting decisions while you're placing ships and tokens.
• Beautiful components and artwork

This is good, but it's clear that the people raving about it were attracted to the production quality unusual for Victory Point games, but have never played their other solo titles, which are just as good or better.  (I'm thinking especially of Dawn of the Zeds.)

Excellent theme. Fun mechanics. Even with its unrelenting solitaire nature you feel as though you have a chance, but do you?

Let's see!

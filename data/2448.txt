Depending on the physical pieces this can be an extremely exhaustive game to play once cups get filled. You simply cannot tell whether there are 7 or 14 pieces in a cup. Much better on a computer that tells you the exact number in each cup. 

At first, challenges your brains since you have plan several moves ahead but I am afraid that the game becomes somewhat scripted after a few games (in other words you solve it). Replayability can be achieved from altering the number of pieces initially placed in each cup.

Such a simple game at its heart.  And yet it can keep people enthralled as they try to sow their beans for the season (I will always think of this as a crop growing game.)  I enjoy playing this game when I just want to play a game without thinking.  I play it better when I don't try to plan out my moves.  It is calming, almost soothing for my mind to play.  (I really should just get a board and play before sleeping.)

Not a bad little game.  It's on par with checkers, only faster and a little more fun.  It's one of those games that could pass as filler and I could easily be talked into playing, even though I am the worst Mankala player in the entire world.

Πολύ παλιό abstract 2-player παιχνίδι που πλέον έχει καταλήξει να χρησιμοποιείτε σαν μηχανισμός σε διάφορα eurogames. Έχουμε λοιπόν ένα ταμπλό με μπολάκια με πετραδάκια μέσα και 2 μεγάλα μπολ όπου μαζεύεις τους πόντους. Εμείς παίξαμε με 6 πετραδάκια ανά μπολάκι.

Τα μισά μπολάκια είναι δικά σου και τα υπόλοιπα του αντιπάλου. όποια πέτρα καταλήξει στο μεγάλο μπολ σου, μετράει σαν πόντος στο τέλος. Ξερό παιχνίδι στρατηγικής.

Στη γύρα σου διαλέγεις ένα από τα μπολάκια σου, παίρνεις όλες τις πέτρες και τις αφήνεις μια μια κυκλικά σε κάθε μπολ. Αν η τελευταία καταλήξει στο μεγάλο μπολ σου τότε ξαναπαίζεις. Επίσης αν η τελευταία καταλήξει σε δικό σου άδειο μπολ τότε την σκοράρεις μαζί με όλες τις πέτρες του απέναντι μπολ.

Απλό και γρήγορο 2 player abstact παιχνίδι παντός καιρού. Καλή επιλογή για παραλία.

I've played the variant called Kalaha, and I really don't know how to grade this game properly. On the one hand, I really like the look and the feel of the game and it certainly has hidden depths. On the other hand, this game has such a strong first player advantage, and it becomes painfully evident even when mortals like your truly play the game, so it's essentially broken. I really wish someone could come up with a solution to this problem; to simply use the pie/swap rule isn't sufficient.

Dispongo de un mancala tallado a mano que me trajo Barbadillo de Mauritania, del pueblo Dogon, allá por el 2012 o así. Le tengo mucho cariño a este juego. He jugado muchísimas partidas, pero hasta enero de 2016 no registré ninguna.
Es un juego tradicional africano, que consiste en seis agujeros enfrentados. El turno de un jugador consiste en recoger las piedras de un agujero e ir soltando una en cada agujero a la derecha, hasta ubicar todas. Cuando llegas al último agujero de la derecha (en tu lado del jugador), la piedra pasa a tu "bolsa". Además, si consigues que una última piedra caiga en tu lado te llevas esa y todas las piedras del agujero enfrentado.
La mecánica es muy simple, pero da para pensar un buen rato. 
Me gusta mucho este juego.

I tried so hard to like this game, because it's a "classic."  Found at least half a dozen variations to try, but they're all just counting games.  Yes, I'm an adult, I know how to count.

Mancala is more of a game system (like a deck of cards) than a game itself; there are numerous games you can play with a mancala board.  That alone is a good thing about it.  Plus the games are quite strategic; no luck.  And there is no other game quite like it.  That, and its ancient history, make it a winner in my book.  Young kids can play too -- another plus factor.  Main Mancala games for a 2x6 board = Kalah and Oware. Other main games are played on a 4x8 board; these are Bao and Umweso.  For some additional 2x6 games consider The Bead Game (an Oware variant--played on a 2x5 but could work for a 2x6 by adding one extra color of bead -- or just use 5 of the 6 pits on each side and play the standard game), Bohnenspiel (like Oware, but with different capture numbers), Kauri, and Bohn Duell (for a 2x4 board, but could be played on a 2x6 board by ignoring two pits).

Too much counting involved in sensible play. I don't mind the math, but other 2-player games like "Cathedral" or "Lost Cities" are simply more appealing due to the presence of a (albeit thin) theme and the possibility to trade some exact math against intuition without loosing entirely.

This rating, and comment, apply solely to Kalah, not the mancala family as a whole.

Being solved, the game sits in a weird position. I'm terrible at it, but being solvable, it has strategic potential, so that's attractive, but if I get so good as to solve it, the game is broken (although, I hear, fixable with the pie rule).

But, this is not a concern at the moment, as at the moment, I am stumbling around losing all of my stones.

A good game for the younger kids.  On the complexity level of something like checkers.  Although the rules are very straightforward, some of the tactical decisions will probably escape the younger kids.  Seems like seven or eight year olds would be able to make some of the trickier moves.  Older than that, and it probably isn't nearly as fun.  Actually, I haven't played an adult yet - who knows.

Kalah, the game I've always understood to be "Mancala," is apparently one of the less interesting variants of a family of games. So let's not take me to be an expert on the matter.

That said, the various games of this family are genuinely stimulating, not least because Chess and its derivatives are so thorougly ingrained in the Western conception of what a "boardgame" is that something that completely inverts those expectations is a real eye-opener.

My wife owns a hand-made (two row) board from West Africa, thus "owned."

Production: There are some very pretty wooden sets out there, with glass stones.  My set is of standard size; I find it a bit awkward to pull the stones from the cups, due to the cups’ shallowness and the length of my fingers.  Play: A very mechanical, but relaxing game.  I wouldn’t play this competitively, but there are a few people with whom I could enjoy several consecutive playings of this.  (2+1+2) (24 plays)

So this is an old game. A very old game! But there must be something to it if it's been around so long, right?
The thing is it's abstract and a bit boring to look at, plus the rules seem basic and uninteresting. Once, and IF in most cases, you get pass all that, there is a very clever, strategic and fun game underneath. How challenging play is, will depends on your opponent. A good opponent will force you to adjust and change your strategies regularly during game play.
I like this. But then again I win at it a lot.

I condier this entry to be for the common rules found in most [family=9][/family] sets sold commercially, [b]Kalah[/b].

I am not into Abstract Strategy. It's not my favorite mechanic/theme. I find it to be not to my liking compare to other game mechanics. There are better Abstract Strategy games out there. Yinsh is a whole lot more to my liking than Mancala.

I wouldn't say no to trying other Abstract Strategy games.

It wasn't really interesting for a 2 player abstract. Wasn't fun either. It's not my kind of game. It didn`t really impress me.

It's very doubt full that I would replay this game any time soon to see my opinion changes.

It doesn't really hold my interest. There are too many better games out there that playing this game on a regular basis is a waste of time. Why would you spend time playing a bad game when you can play a game which is more worth your time and enjoyment?

Classic abstract strategy game involving counting.  

Edition owned: [gameid=32042] - Cranium edition of the classic [gameid=2448]

Good overview of the entire family here:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Mancala_Family

Most common way to play is [url=http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Kalah]Kalah[/url], invented by William J. Champion in 1940, and the most popular form of the game in the US.
Rule notes:
1. According to his official rules, the opposite enemy pit must be non-empty to capture, and if it is empty your seed remains on the board (some play this otherwise) ([url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/9476116#9476116]link[/url])
2. At game end, if you don't have pieces on your side then your opponent captures all remaining pieces on his side. ([url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/9476110#9476110]link[/url])

For more of a challenge, try this mancala game: [gameid=28302]

Traditional puzzle-type game with no luck involved. One of those games that almost everyone knows (or at least it used to be that way) in this part of the world. Sets around here are usually carved from heavy wood, with seashells as the pieces. Nice in an ethnic sort of way. Sort of boring, but certainly not bad for an abstract.

Don't play against an expert (of any age range).  You'll get creamed.  But regardless of that, a fun game.  Played three games with Mr. Billington and won the first two fairly easily, but only won by 1 point in the last game with him.  He learned it quickly.  Today (7-10-2010) I won two games vs. Mr. Billington, but the restaurant where we played was REALLY noisy and it's no surprise he couldn't concentrate.  Next time we need to play in a quieter place.

A decent abstract that plays quick. It requires some thinking, but it's not as much of a brainburner as Chess or Go. Some criticise it for being "solved". Like Checkers, it was only solved on a computer, and a human would have trouble implementing the optimal solution without the aid of a computer, so I don't label the game as broken.

Why Why doesn't anyone want to play it with me? I'm sure to lose at it too! I'm just a wimp at this kind of games! It would be such a self-esteem boost for anyone! But I'm not gonna give up - I still have a few aces up my sleeve, there are people to blackmail and coerce! Plus it has so many variants that it's just silly! Anybody could find something to like about one of them, surely? Mine is called Kalaha but it's just about capturing in a different way and picking up a certain amount of seeds/pebbles if I understand it properly...

I only play the Awale version which seems to me much more tactical than the Mancala version. I usualy dislike abstract game because i usually find that player takes way too much time to take their turns, but with this one a player only have 1 of 6 choices so it cuts down a lot on the thinking time! and makes it a quick but deep game.. plus it reminds me my holidays in ivory coast when i was 6 :)

When I got this as a kid, I played the crap out of it. It was one of the first games I taught my niece to play when I used to be her nanny. I found this recently at a garage sale, and finally got a chance to revisit it.  I taught this to my husband in about 30 seconds. As far as gameplay goes, it was like riding a bike.  I remembered all my old strategies, and I shared them with my husband so he would want to play again in the future. My problem is, it gets quite boring. Same old moves, same old strategies. Great for kids or maybe older folks. But, Im probably not going to pull this out again any time soon.

A decent, and ancient, time passer.  It's okay- but it feels like it relies too much on counting and less on "feeling" You can manipulate the board to put your partner in a tough position, but these options appear rather obvious once you've counted the beans and determined the effects. I'm sure there's better variants out there than Kalah (which is what I played), but I don't feel like I need to revisit Mancala for a while.

Also known as Bantumi or Owari, Mancala is one of those rare breed of games which depend 100% on skill and strategy, with no element of luck whatsoever.  Although the rules for the Mancala family are many and diverse (including an enjoyable solitaire version), the simplest version involves "sowing" the contents ("beans") of one of your six cups anti-clockwise into successive cups. If the final bean lands in your own Mancala (the big cup) you continue your turn. If the final bean lands in an empty cup on your side of the board, you capture the contents of the corresponding cup on your opponents side. Mancala is very easy to learn, and quite young children can derive a lot of fun from the counting aspects and will soon be giving older siblings and even parents a good run for their money.  Commercial plastic sets are available, but the tactile qualities of a fair-traded carved wood set from Africa will heighten your enjoyment of this wonderful game, which has a reasonable claim to being the oldest strategy game of them all.

This is a great little game that offers quite a bit of stratagy and tactics. It plays really quick and is a lot of fun. Some sets are highly detailed and just gorgeous, but I am happy with my little fold up travel edition of the game.

It makes for a great start of the evening game, while waiting for others to show up, or can be a great filler also. This is an excellent 2 player game.

Played in childhood. My parents had a set with pretty glass stones, which we played a few times. I think I had a brief phase of trying to understand how to play well, but it can't have held my interest much because I don't remember clearly.

I guess "Kalah" is what bgg calls mancala...I like this game though. A very tactile (fun to touch) abstract that plays quick and doesn't make you burn your brain. Fairly "solvable" though...even though I'm no where close to solving it, just knowing I could play optimally with just a bit more thought makes me enjoy it less.

Many people play with rules that turn this interesting and strategic game into a silly bean fest.  There are lots of rule sets.  The most basic (and most strategic) rules seem to allow for capturing by sowing your last seed in an empty pit across from your opponent's seeds and playing again if you sow your last seed in your mancala.

A classic redneck game played with an egg carton.   Pebbles from the crik are recommended, though the game can be played with rocks from the road if you are one of those fancy people who gots their driveway all graveled over.

I like it a lot, although there is a small start player bias.

An attractive conversation piece as well as a fun abstract. There are a lot of variants to this one, so be sure you are playing by the same rules when you start.

Simple rules, and in the most popular version with 6 pits, you only have 6 possible moves to make on each turn. Getting multiple turns and setting up captures is where the strategy lies, but it&#039;s still not that deep. One of the oldest games in the world, if not the oldest. Too many 100&#039;s of variations and overall game simplicity make this a bit unfit for serious players, but any game you can make out of an egg carton and a pack of Skittles is bound to be somewhat enjoyable.

This game is is easy to learn and easy to play.  I found it taking a bit longer to play.  More like 15 minutes.  Developing a strategy will probably take a couple of game plays however.  It's a counting game actually.  You need to know how many beeds you have in each cup and know where to place them to get extra turns and take your opponent's beeds.  It's worth a game play or two, however there are more exiting games out there to occupy your time.

Mancala isn't the deepest game ever, but it's stood the test of time and keeps me relatively engaged.  I have a little leather and wood folding case for travel and play with my girlfriend when the mood strikes us.  I find it to be mostly a planning game where you set yourself up while avoiding leaving optimal plays for your opponent.  -Mildly addictive in short spurts.

Mancala hace referencia a una familia de juegos, no a un juego en sí,muy antiguos y que se juegan por toda Africa y Asia con diferentes variantes. Las que se hayan en mi colección son las variantes de cuatro filas,jugadas en el África Oriental ("Bao"- traido de Tanzania), de dos filas ("oware" Camerún) y plegable de madera de una fila... haberlos los hay hasta de 6 filas... bello y sencillo a la par que profundo

RATING: 5
I like this fun little ancient abstract, very very simple in thoery and play but you do need to calculate a fair bit, do some counting and consider several moves in order to make "good moves" making it quite tactical. I see people saying that it is quite strategic but I don't see how anyone could plan ahead more than one or two moves as you can never be fully certain want your opponent will do and this affects everything you do, maybe I'm wrong and it needs more plays or certain variants are indeed more strategic. After saying that the bit of planning you do do is quite important or you can get hosed and like chess you need to consider all your opponenet's moves. You can play a little dirty and screw up your opponent's "good moves" and also the dirty sneaky capture is one of the best features in the game. I'm interested in trying some of the variants but I do feel there is only so much to explore here and it doesn't stay fresh very long, good for a few VERY occasional plays. 

Update: After 20 plays it seems the first player has a huge advantage and always wins by a big margin which sucks because I liked this little game for the occasional play, rating falls from 5.75 => 5. If variants don't solve this rating will fall more, also it does feel like the game would be easily solvable with more plays which will spoil it as well.

Classic game about collecting the most stones.  This is an abstract strategy game that can be light or invoke some thought.  But the long-term thought (more than 3-5 turns) does not seem to have too much impact.

This was a childhood favorite of mine. I've met up with different variants and have enjoyed some of them. However, after having played this so much, my moves feel very rote. I always do the same thing. Whenever, I've tried to break out, it's usually just bad strategy. Sadly, this doesn't have the place in my heart that it once did.

Initial Rating: 4 (July 2011)

When I read the rules I said to myself “That´s all?”. I really thought there was going to be more to this game. But after a couple of games I updated my rating as I found some depth hidden in Mancala. This is not a game I would like to play very often, but My GF loves it so I will hang onto it.

It is very easy to teach, it has low luck, and it plays very quickly, however, it almost always leaves me unfulfilled, I would like to play something more meaty. After a couple of games I feel the game to be exceedingly repetitive, so it has a low replay value for me. The solution? I´m excited to try it with the expansion 10 mighty men :D!

An important game to have in your collection if you have kids, and not a bad idea for serious collectors either if you find a good wood set with unique stones (or shells, whatever). Develops logical/mathematical thought and planning. There are apparently dozens (even hundreds) of variant rules, so even if you find one way leads to stagnation or "solved play" you can find other rules to shake up the game.

Many names and variations for this great abstract strategy game. My favourite is Awale: only 2 two rows of six bin (no scoring bin), you capture only in the opponent's field, when the last piece set the amount of the bin at 2 or 3. If previous bin(s) has 2 or 3, you capture them too. If a bin has 12 or more pieces (complete round), skip it when you drop pieces. If a player gets empty, other must move to supply him with at least one piece, if he can (if he can't, he gets all pieces for himself and the game ends). 
Wonderful if played on an original african board!

Mancala, a classic abstract game so simplistically elegant that everyone should play at least once in their lives.  After a few plays you will tend to grow tired of its repetitiveness and put it away for five years till you forgot about how exactly to play then bring it out again.  The whole process will repeat till your death.

A classic that is just great to play. I am not good at abstract games, very much the same applies for deduction games but...I have a thing for them! Mancala is just clever and it plays quickly. A nice quick brain exercise for two...how lovely?!

RATING: 3
Mancala-style games are really hard to read ahead. Humans absolutely stink at this style of game (easy to write better AIs), which means in practice the game has little depth (mostly memorization / heuristics). Definitely not my cup of tea.

RATING: 6
Game in a Nutshell: Secure the most pebbles... you'll get it when you start playing it.

Two-player only.

Pros: Far more to it then it appears at first. Best of all you can scrap together stuff to build your own game of it and play anywhere. Quick and easy to teach, and super fast to play.

Cons: While it's easy to forget, the game can be overly mathematic, even for an abstract. Because of that it will probably serve more as a quick (but still fun) distraction and be put away after you've had your fill of counting stones.

Best Use: A quick game during lunch or coffee.

Well this is a pretty broad entry, "Mancala" is the name given to a broad class of games that share similar boards and may or may not have similar rules. One of the Mancala ruleset that I have played was a ton of fun and I would rate it an '8', the other one wasn't as good and I'd rate it a '5'. So overall I rate the thing a '6' (-0.5 because of the confusion caused by naming several different games the same!!)

For proper enjoyment, play this game with a good set. Not the one that comes in the "Family 7 + Mancala" tin. This is fun to play with kids, especially 6- to 8-year-olds, because they get pretty enthusiastic.

The Awale rule-set is a classic game that seems so simple. I mean you're just picking up pieces and paying them forwards into the next spaces, trying to end your spread on an opponent's space that only has 1 or 2 stones on it because you'll capture them (and then working backwards through the spaces to see if you capture more). But the more you play the deeper it gets. The decision tree is pleasingly narrow (there's only 6 spaces to start your move from) but working through the implications and counter moves can be pleasingly deep, trying to setup captures, moving out of the right spaces to limit captures on your side, etc. Obviously it's completely abstract so there's a limited market, but it's dead easy to learn and can be attractive to look at so it makes for a good coffee table game.

Mancala fascinated me when I was as a kid because I'd never seen or played anything like it. The day I was shown it, I then proceded to make my own versions of it out of pebbles and egg cartons. However, I never learned the full rules. I don't think I ever played this game correctly. Still, Mancala is part of my gaming history.

Received a very beautiful set as a gift.  It sat out as decoration until a friend saw it and when we explained we did not know how to play, he sat down and taught us.  One of the "classic" abstract strategy games I enjoy.

RATING: 5
Another winner in the ratio of depth per rules and pieces. With nothing more than stones and holes you get a simple yet clever mechanic that results in a quick strategy game that never seems to get old. I tend to give most solid abstract games a rating of 5.

It's an ancient game of pebbles in shallow holes.

The kids request this often and I enjoy playing it with them. It's simple enough to be one of the few games in our collection that the 4-year-old can play, so I consider it a "gateway" game in that respect. Fun for a quick, 10-minute time-killer.

A family of games like chess, played in a circle of pits. Pits are filled with counters which are scooped up and then deposited one at a time into the following pits. Finishing with particular numbers of counters in particular circles allows you to capture them, the player who has captured the most counters at the end of the game being the winner.
I've not had much opportunity to play this as I do not have a regular opponent for two player games but its simplicity has a certain appeal.

An exercise in thinking ahead that isn't as much fun as some other games out there.

I've a beautiful handcrafted board gifted to me by a gentleman who simply brought it in to the shop one day and handed it over.  We'd had some interesting and animated discussions on the nature of "mancala", his travels, games in general, and so on -- it was his way of saying "thanks", I suppose, for the good conversation.  In any case, he had originally been given it many years ago by a tribe the name of whom I never actually got -- he referred the game as "itsubi" or "itsuwi", but in discussing the nature of play I'm reasonably sure it was wari or very close to it.  As for the game itself, like draughts most people don't seem to understand the depth of strategy involved and thus do not appreciate the game for what it is.  Such is a great pity, because it really is one of the great abstract strategy games.  For many years, western anthropologists wrote it off as a primitive game... only recently has it begun to gain the recognition it deserves.

Edit:  revised down from an 8 to a 7.  Not as engaging as I remember it, but still enjoyable.  Definitely needs to be played by tournament oware rules (or otherwise advanced rules sets that more or less prevent draws between superior players)

I can understand chess and backgammon thriving for all these years, but Mancala?!  It's an ok abstract strategy game, just not interesting or appealing enough for me to suggest playing it.  Depending on the set, the components can look very nice.

My wife picked this game up at a garage sale because my 6-year-old daughter said she likes playing it at school.  The first night we played it my daughter beat me, then my wife, and then our 12-year-old son.  That was a good game night for her!

Update:  Within almost a week we have played this game 24 times!  My daughter and I played a best of 5 match while my son was at swim practice.  She won the 5th game by just two stones.  I really like that I can play my best and she can still beat me.  She crushed me at a game night last night and then beat one of the most experienced gamers by a similar score.  These must be great experiences for her.  Mancala has also kindled an interest in other classic games...I want to look into backgammon (we have had it for years and never played it, maybe cribbage too).

Rating is for Kwalhi which is the base Mancala game.  I've never played it but gave it a shot after finding a $1 Mancala set on clearance.  Seems basic, and also like there is a huge first turn player advantage, but I've only tried it once.  I'll give it another shot or two, and maybe try that adult version Oware some time.

My son really likes this game (he's 5). Depending on the rules you play and how you play it, can be a simple 'out on the porch in summer' type game. Can also be a deeper game prone to AP if you try to think and plan ahead. I rarely play the latter, but I see the potential there if played competitively.

My rating is for the sub-par game, Kalah, which is included as the "standard" set of rules in many American sets. That said, there are specific games in the Mancala family that I do enjoy, including Bao and Oware, both of which I have rated separately in the BGG database.

A very simple abstract game, and not one I expected to like. Mancala mechanisms intrigue me, and sometimes can be fun, while other times they annoy me. Kalah is the mechanism at it's heart; it's essentially all the game is. But I like the way it functions; trying to give your opponent stones so they don't have empty slots, but also not wanting to give them too many options. Trying to develop different strategies and strong opening moves. I'm not sure there is a great depth of strategy here, but what is there I thoroughly enjoy.

So far I have played out of the box 4 seed Kalah.  It is strangely addictive, in the same way Tetris was on innumerable gaming consoles.  You can quickly develope a winning strategy.  Likeable game I guess, and the pace of the game picks up rapidly.  If you are looking for a cheap Abstract Strategy game to kill some time, this is it.  When you have got bored try other game rules such as Oware which is a much more satisfying game to play.  I would probably recommend buying a game with deep or wide 'Dishes'.  Will hold off scoring it until I have played a few more people and variations.

Flash Review of Mancala

[b]Summary:[/b]
+ Fast, infinitely replayable, very pleasant, good for thinkers, good for casual players
- I can't think of anything negative to say.


[b]Rules:[/b]
Slightly less simple than new players seem to expect, but still very simple.

[b]Components:[/b]
Depends on your copy. Often beautiful, but often so poor that you can't fit enough ugly stones in a section.

[b]Theme:[/b]
None.

[b]Luck:[/b]
None. It's an open-information abstract game like chess, but usually played very casually by non-experts.

[b]Interaction:[/b]
Strong. The game is played entirely

[b]Strategy:[/b]
The game is primarily about careful, long-term strategic thinking unless both players are playing casually, which is also a fantastic way to play.

[b]Tactics:[/b]
The game is rarely tactical unless both players are playing casually. I love to play it casually while having a conversation, but it's great either way.

[b]Analysis Paralysis:[/b]
Depends on the player. It's very easy to play very quickly with a timer or with a general sense of casual play. However, it's possible to spend a lot of time imagining what your opponent might wish to do and plan several turns ahead of time.

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Very easy to comprehend and play.

[b]Length:[/b]
Most of my games take 3 to 10 minutes.

[b]Replayability:[/b]
Endless. I once became tired of playing with a particular partner because she was playing the same moves and was too predictable. I still enjoyed playing with her though, so long as I turned off the strategic and competitive parts of my brain and just enjoyed moving the marbles around while discussing pedagogy with her and a glass of wine.

Nice short game, not for beginners.  You can play and watch a game on TV with it.  Can be frustrating until you pick up the tactics.

I used to hate this game but I've found the manufacturer's rules were wrong. With correct rules, it's a good game.

Have liked it the few times I've played it. However, I've never been clear about the rules so I'm never sure I'm playing it correctly.

This African game is traditionally played with seeds in a wood-carved board.  There are lots of variants with differing numbers of pits & rules.  My set was made in the Phillipines, has 2 sets of 7 pits across each side plus 2 large pits for scoring.  Instead of seeds it has seashells, starting with seven per pit.  On your turn you choose a pit to start 'planting' from and distribute those seeds one by one clockwise (or counter-clockwise, depending on the rules).  Clever choices allow players to score shells in their scoring pit, and  capture whole groups of an  opponents shells.  Its a fairly fast, fun game with neat components.

Pure distilled gaming spirit.  A board and one single type of playing piece.  Sheer elegant simplicity.

Great abstract strategy game that has obviously stood the test of time. I love how easy this is to teach and play, yet there's great opportunity here for strategy and mental math. My 6 yr old regularly kicks my butt in Mancala, and it's one of our favourite two player games. Nice and quick to fit into a busy day.

Classic abstract game, that my son and I play fairly often.  I play as quick as possible so I'm more likely to make mistakes.  He pulls out a win about 1/4 of the time.

Great game to play with kids as they learn the winning algorithm. Once they have figured that out, then you can introduce rule variations to keep it lively. I like letting the kids come up with the rule variation and then we play test it. Good learning experience for them.

If chess was a counting game.

But it has the advantages over chess of setting up in 15 seconds, of playing in less than 15 minutes, and of mechanics so simple my 4YO can enjoy it. For these reasons it's recently filled the space chess somewhat poorly occupied as the quick pre-bedtime tournament game.
 
A must for homeschooling. Outstanding for practicing mental math and concentration. Three seeds per bowl is great for the youngest ones.

It's main shortcoming is just the one inherent to most games of pure skill in blocking the weaker player. To solve this, challenge the weaker player to win x number of seeds, and/or challenge yourself to loose by x number of seeds, then scale your play as she improves.

I don't like this very much because it seems to have pacing problems.  Like you are trying to complete a certain task, but if you complete it too well, then you get in trouble.

From its ancient origins, Mancala provides an interesting game play experience that not too many other games mimic - its rules are simple to learn, and make for some nice decisions.

GAME: Animal Upon Animal: Crest Climbers
RANK: 3238

RATING: 8
Pure stacking joy. In no way mechanically different than regular animal upon animal but it is exclusive to Gen Con 2015 in the US so I felt totally justified in picking up a copy. If you like stacking games, this is up there. Good for kids and adults alike.

Better than the original; more interesting animal shapes, which is key for adults playing this.

I like the stacking but this feels like it is missing a bit of a game.

RATING: 5
Mechanically no different than any other version of the game. A neat little dexterity game that we usually use as filler when we're gaming at lunch time at the office.

Basically the same game as the original with differently shaped animals.  Same rating, same fun!

RATING: 5.5
Enjoyment of the game can vary simply based upon the number of Mountain actions a person rolls. Will need to houserule that a mountain action must be re-rolled if there are animals next to the mountain that have nothing stacked on them. Also might need to employ Jenga rules, where if the pyramid collapses, you score how many animals you have left (and the one who collapsed it adds say 5) and then start over. Lowest score after 3 rounds wins?

age4+; 2-4pp

Variant for more than 4pp:
-If you ever directly cause a collapse — even if it isn’t your turn — you take any one of the fallen animals in front of you as a scorekeeper and return the rest of the fallen animals to the supply. If any of the stack remains, it stays as-is.
-When there is a collapse, the current player must still finish their turn.
-game ends when X total fallen animals have been collected. (Note: X is perhaps the number of players
-person with the lowest number of collected fallen animals is the winner. There can be multiple winners.

Details
1. It’s okay to use the piece you are placing to (attempt to!) adjust the stack. It is NOT okay to touch the stack in any other way.
2. If only the animal the current player just placed immediately falls off, it is NOT collected as a fallen animal. The current player must try to re-place it successfully.
3. If any animal(s) fall(s) off without obvious blame, return all fallen animals to the supply and continue play.

Game End Options
- End the game when any player has collected X fallen animals (perhaps 3).
- End the game when X total fallen animals have been collected (total among all players).

This is an "adult" rating. When playing with kids and how they enjoy it and all the laugther at the table you could easily rate it an 8. If you like dexterty games like Bausack you probably like this one too. I just wished that the animeeples would be printed both sides.

RATING: 7.5
Simple dexterity game where you place animals on top of each other, governed by a simple die roll.

Good beer and pretzels party game for adults : )

Nice to blow off steam between games. Is definitely harder than standard animal upon animal.

A fine children's game, although there are so many dexteriry games to choose from.

Almost the same as the original. The cows are difficult - if they are slightly tilted, the pieces you put on them just slide down.

Suggest.

Bought in Germany as a gift for my kids (5 & 3). 5-yr old understood the game right away and loves playing. I also enjoy the challenge of balancing the pieces. Good game for the kids and better than "tolerable" for adults.

Outstanding Bausacky fun for German children and drunken British adults. Getting away with publishing this sort of filth is possibly the outstanding game-design achievement of the past 20 years.

Different animals and more challenges. Play this game by itself or add it to Animal Upon Animal. Children's dexterity game that is readily accessible and fun to play for adults as well.  On your turn you simply roll the dice and stack the wooden animals on top of one another as the dice instruct.  Don't let them fall!  Excellent and cute wooden animals add to the fun!

Fun, light, and fabulous.

With gamers, we use this house rule: When rolling a 'mountain', you must rotate the mountain 90 degrees instead of placing an animal.

For all practical purposes, this is the same game as the regular versions. Choose this if you think that firs are animals, or if looking for a slightly more challenging pieces.

Tier auf Tier is a great game, and so is this addition to the already fantastic line of titles. Gipfelstürmer is a great stand-alone in the series, but also fantastic as an add-on to make your Tier auf Tier experience even more fun.

The best new thing about this title is probably the mountain base, instead of the original's crocodile. It just adds a whole lot of variety to the game. You can now mix and match, just by switching bases and dice.

After just one initial play I find Gipfelstürmer harder than the original Tier auf Tier, but that is likely due to not being accustomed with the new pieces yet.

I highly recommend this game.

Preliminary rating after 2 plays.  Have yet to figure out a strategy.  Rating may go up with repeated plays.

My first game was a three player one and worked well. The placement rules are clever, the cards are well designed and the scoring is easy enough to see. All three players thought the game was good and would play again.

Interesting little abstract game obfuscated by a dumb theme.

RATING: 7
Played as a two-player game - reminiscent of Samurai by Knizia. Highly recommended filler card game! Not sure how it will play with more than 2 people, since our first game seemed really short, but fun.

End game scoring is a bit unbalanced. I'd like to get rid or reduce the impact of the following:

- "For each Entertainer whose activity matches your Activity Card, score 2 bonus points."  Reason: All luck of what cards you get, with little impact to end scoring - no opportunity to strategize with this. The end game scoring should motivate you to achieve certain outcomes - but in this case, it seems really random. 

- To paraphrase, "add 5 bonus points for most animals of a certain type." It's good because it rewards last place finishes, but 5 points is too much for end game. I'd rather it be 1 or 2 points. 

UPDATE: My illustrator sister designed and produced beautiful cards and tokens - I'll keep her version... she wants the original for future comparison.

After one play, I'm pretty impressed.  It plays like no other card game I've played to date.  Reminds me a little bit of E&T, though, which probably wouldn't be construed as a bad thing.

The fact that everybody gets their own scorecard, scoring stones, reminder sheet, and plastic penguins (in the deluxe version) right in the box is awesome.  Gives you everything you need to play with no fuss/no muss.  I couldn't believe they fit all that stuff in the tiny box you get.

Production value isn't the best, but it's good enough.  The card quality is pretty good, though.  Oddly, I like the silly MS-Paint style artwork.  It fits the bizarro (but highly amusing) theme.  Speaking of theme, I never thought theme mattered that much for card games, but this one proves me wrong.  I love the idea of entertaining penguins with unicycling polar bears.  Lots of fun.

UPDATE: This game is just plain fantastic.  More depth than what might originally appear.  Scales gloriously from 2 - 4 players.  Great game.

I like penguins.  Thus I bought this game.  Good thing it also turned out to be a good game.  :)  Eight Llama games usually have more going on beneath them than meets the eye, which is what's going on here---you need a couple of plays to wrap your mind around where, exactly, is a good place to put a penguin?... and go on from there.  Enjoyable, but not for some kids---there's too much going on here for some of them.

Jim Doherty and Eight Foot Llama just keep bringing out these great fun games that have fair depth hidden in amazingly light themes.

This one looks like a very simple card laying game but (for some people at least) gets very 'thinky'.

It has been compared to T&E and the comparison holds in the level of counter-intuitiveness there is to the rule set which is, at heart, very, very simple.

RATING: 5
the gameplay is interesting, but the components don't do the game justice, making it fiddly and chaotic.  for me, that ruins the fun of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating is based only upon one play so far, but this is a cool (pardon the pun) card-laying game about surrounding territory. It has a vague relationship to dominos in that each card belongs to two different suits. Since play is in two dimensions, it's much harder to block other players than in dominos. But since you can only have three scoring penguins on cards at a time, and you only get to move one on your turn, tempo is extremely important. To use Go terms, the player with sente usually has a huge advantage over players in gote.

My group all enjoyed this - it feels less abstract than it is because of the theme, I suspect.  The mechanic of having the player with the lowest point total for an entertainment resolution taking the entertainment card serves as an excellent balancing mechanism.

Alright, this was just goofy enough to grab my attention.  And I've played a couple of games, enough to say, it's another one of those games where the strategy avoids me, but I have fun playing.  It's definately complex to try to explain to people, so have the rules down pat before starting to explain.

It seems to be a tile laying game. Fun and interesting. i am glad I bought it.

I made the mistake of trying to acquire the most important entertainers, but didn't pay enough attention to just acquiring points by closing the acts. This wound up costing me some victory points that I could have used at the end of the game.

RATING: 6
Penguin Ultimatum has a cute theme but quite an abstract feel. There is a reasonably significant amount of luck, however the game is quite short to play so does not suffer too significantly from that. There are some reasonably good mechanics, for example, of the players that score for a performance the lowest scorer earns the performer card which is used for game-end scoring. 
Cute but fairly dry in spite of the theme. I'd play it again but I don't mind if I never play again either.

This is not a card game.  It's a tile laying game.  But instead of tiles, you're using cards. It's a thinky game.  Had this game been lavishly produced (with tiles) with a better theme, it could have done much, much better.

There's maybe a small problem with Eight Foot Llama games -- the games are okay, but they don't live up to the wonderful themes. This is the case here. The game is pretty good, and I like playing it okay, but it's so colorful and theme-y that I just feel like I didn't get all the promised enjoyment out of it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Lots of fun in a small package.  This isn't the deepest tile-laying game you'll play this year, but there are certainly enough real decisions to keep you engaged from start to finish.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun, and with surprisingly difficult decisions to make at times. Giving the entertainer card to the player with the least points for that performance can prompt some agonizing moments. It is hard to remember the mingling fees, though. I want to rate it higher, but it doesn't often come up when we discuss what games to play. I should rectify that...

Ultimate Edition with fun plastic penguins in assorted colors. This one, as it seems with most of the Eight Foot Llama games, has surprisingly more depth to it than the theme and cheezy graphics and production would imply. This is an interesting tile-laying (card laying really) game that plays great with just the two of us. The plastic penguins in this edition just step it up that extra notch.

I'm not adept enough to specify how, but we found the rules included with this game to be unclear, and badly written or laid out.  We played our first game incorrectly (we didn't know we could move already-played markers amongst cards in the layout), and it was only on my third game that I started to see some strategies.  Good game, confusing rulebook.

Great light fun tile placement game with cards.  It has a surprising amount of depth and is engaging to the end.  Sadly they made computer generated and rendered juggling balls rather than all the wonderfully dopey "hand drawn" graphics.  It really takes away from the big picture.  Still one little gripe for an overall wonderful stepping stone game.  Update: The new pieces in the deluxe edition are awesome.

Just misses the cut for me. There are some interesting choices to be made in this one, and room for clever play. Having the player who scores least take the entertainer card is a nice balancing mechanism, which usually keeps the scores tight. However, despite the "wacky" theme (which is so forced and meshes so poorly with the mechanics that it's actually a bit of a distraction), this game simply isn't a lot of fun. And frankly, there are better tile-laying games out there that are more interesting and streamlined. Penguin Ultimatum isn't unique or exceptional enough to have a spot on my game shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based only on the two player game. This is the best of Jim Doherty's offerings so far. This game is easily explained in 5 minutes or less, and is tactically interesting. Looking forward to trying it with more players, but plays fine with two.

RATING: 6
Interesting tile-laying game that might be brought out more if the bits appealed more.  Which is why, when playing with the penguins from Hey! That's MY Fish! and a Carcassonne scoreboard (use 3 penguins for the game, 1 for the scoreboard, perfect) this appealed to the kids when I wasn't so keen on playing H!TMF! again.

This is a fantastic game for a relatively small investment. It's funny and fun, but has a deceptive tactical depth to it, that makes it more appealing and replayable than the usual 'fun' games (a la Cheapass). And who can argue with a game that's about penguins being amused by various performing animals?

Although I like "Monkeys on the Moon" a bit better, Penguins is still a fine offering from this small publisher. It's a quick game with some tricky decisions, turn angst, and multiple paths to success. Also, you gotta love the artwork. (My mom does!) :-)

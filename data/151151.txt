A very good and well-themed game, but I wonder about its long-term replayability: buying heroes seems the only viable strategy.

Complaints? Rather fiddly. And the rulebook. What a horribly organized and badly written rulebook! Hard to believe it was made and published by anglophones.

I really, really wanted to like this game. The theme and art are great. But the monster attacks are so random! While I think the idea is to attack the leader, in practice it never hurts the leader nearly as much as other players- so run away leader is an issue. Progress can be impossible no matter what you do, because monster attacks are random and anything you try to do to catch up makes you a target...so ends up being futile. No real ability to plan anything, and frankly it ends up being wiped out anyway. I'd rather just play a dungeon crawl as I have more control...and that is saying something. Frustrating and not fun at all. And as others have said, takes way too long for what it is. So sad.

3 - 4 player resort building game.  This is a long (2 hour) game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
There is absolutely nothing that is done to mitigate monsters coming at the end of the first round.  It was shuffled well, but clustering happens, and we had about 5-6 monsters come up int he first 7-8 cards, and basically one person got attacked every single time and lost his heroes, tourists, and was down to a single building (previously I thought that both were destroyed, but the designer clarified a rule).  He drew his hand but did not receive a single Lazy peon so he could not defend any of the attacks. 

Before you say "not drawing any Lazy Peons is such a low probability of occurring", it actually will occur in over 25% of the opening hands.  There are 13 cards, and only 3 lazy peons, so there is a (12/15)*(11/14)*(10/13)*(9/12)*(8/11) chance that you will not draw a single Lazy Peon,which calculates to 26.37%, and statistically speaking, one player in every 4 player game will have that happen to them.  In our particular game, two people actually had this scenario

You could possibly make the argument "well the person should have known what was coming".  But in theory, if you had a lot of experienced players, they will make sure they don't have the most heroes, tourists, or gold, and then it boils down to tie-breaker, which is whomever is closest to the start player, is in this type of game not a reasonable tie-breaker.  It reminds me a lot like Power Grid, which I don't like, in that you are basically trying to keep a low enough number of tourists or heroes to avoid attracting any monsters

Overall, it's another deckbuilder, with a few interesting twists, but fundamentally a deckbuilder, which I don't really enjoy.

A little fiddly in managing everything, but... what a theme! Mechanically innovative in that it does nicely capture the feeling of resort building, and the training of workers, luring of tourists / adventurers, fending off marauders or troublesome beasties. Well worth slogging through the rules and giving the game a go. BUT... the game does feel rather punishing, and does not reward one for building a truly epic resort, as per the very title, as that would be the prime target for most of the monsters - which did ruin ambitions somewhat. A little refinement on that front, though, and the system could be great. Not too many monster attacks so as to be overwhelming, attractions require tactical timing (and saving up for), and there is a good variety of heroes (that heal up and leave rather quicker than might be imagined). The only thing struggled with is maintaining the amount of worker icons necessary to keep tourist levels high, as replenishing them depends entirely on the dock draw (and are very hotly contested). A rather unique experience.

Hand management, drafting, economy, and upgrades!  It feels a lot more like a drafting/worker placement/tableau building game than a deck building game.  I really like it!

While the deck is the backbone of what you can do, it's only a portion of what you'll be thinking about.  Your attentions will be equally devoted to attractions, tourists, heroes, workers, and mitigating potential damage from monsters (this one maybe a little less so).  

The game does a good job of drawing you into your role of resort owner by giving you a good bit to think about and manage.  While you probably won't get brain burn, good and careful planning can lead to some great worker-attraction-dock card synergy.  It's really fun when you get them all riffing off each other.

For the first game or two, I recommend configuring the monster deck for two players regardless of player count because the game might drag a bit.

Also, if you don't like games where your stuff gets messed with, you probably won't like this.  Monsters only attack four categories: harbormaster, most money, most tourists, most heroes.  If you have decent heroes, monster effects can be negated as well (with damage delt to heroes).  Knowing that, you can lower the chance of a monster sacking you, but they'll probably get you at some point or another.  Thank goodness for lazy peons!

**I've played this game 6-8 times now and my opinion has changed a little bit.  The theme and art really elevate the mechanics in this game.  The game is fun, but it's fun because the theme and the art are fun.  

There is probably too much randomness going on in this game between the attraction stacks, available workers, dock deck, and your own card draw to employ much of a strategy.  Which is a shame because all the card interactions are there to make this a really great strategic game, but due to how the game lays out on the table, I end up just making the best of what is there every game - once in a while I can pull off a great combo, but probably not more than a few times a game if I'm lucky.  

The game is also pretty clunky with all of its phases.  My wife, who has played it with me every time, still has a hard time remembering how the combat phase works, and I would too if I didn't have to refresh myself every time my wife needed to know.  This game doesn't play very smoothly at all.  We're always following the outline in the rulebook.  

It's not a bad game.  It's actually pretty fun - it's just that Epic Resort feels like a light game with a heavy/bloated game phase structure.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Some nice concepts. Nothing really happens the way it feels like it should. Start player is way to powerful to not rotate naturally. Not much player interaction, the locations are all basically the same and the lazy peons make you want to actively get attacked so you can get rid of them. The attacks more often than not help rather than hinder you, and never actually destroyed anything of value, so not that scary.

Allthough I like the idea of heroes defending there resort in order to be able to relax, I do not like how the mechanics interact. There isn't much to do: lay down cards to protect tourists or activate buildings and buy better cards. Monster attacks are to random for my taste and can ruin everything you did in previous turns. To much monsters focus on the starting player.
We did try to like this game, because of the theme and the lovely artwork but we just didn't have fun.

I love this game. The box art caught my attention at BGG.Con 2016, the premise and theme won me over as the booth staff enthusiastically explained it (I bought the base and expansion immediately), and when we finally got an opportunity to play a full game I kept exclaiming how great it was.

I have trouble with some mechanics courtesy of some cognitive issues, but this game ties them to the theme so well that I didn't have an issue at all! What could have been "reduce chits equal to the number of spaces left blank" became a very thematic "unless you have a full staff catering to your guests, the guests who don't have staff attending them get pissy and leave". It may not seem like a big deal to some people, but being able to make the mechanic feel natural within the theme and the game is an important part of being able to retain mechanics for me and avoid frustration.

I loved that this game drew on a variety of different game mechanics to make it work, from the highly thematic worker placement to the deck-building for the available staffing resources. It created a constantly evolving game where I knew I was ultimately competing against the other resort, but my primary concern was keeping the guests and the heroes happy and, this is important, not getting eaten in surprise attacks. Because I wasn't so focused on winning, it cut my sore loser genetic code off at the knees. 

I love this game. From the fun theme that reminds me of all the dungeon adventuring I've done (via dice because I'm only a paladin in my head) to the mechanics and the endless replay options, I anticipate not needing to find this box a home on the shelves for quite some time, what with it sitting on the table ready to go.

I don't know why this one is getting reports of long play times.  The game is very straightforward to play. The art is also fun. The monsters can get annoying quickly but attractions shouldn't be burned down to easily unless you're not paying attention on protection or how to avoid getting attacked.  I'd be fine playing someone else's copy, don't need to own it, but probably wouldn't request a play.

Epic Resort is a deckbuilding game in which you draft either cards to put in your deck, attraction boards, tourists to put in your attractions that give you money, or heroes that go in your attractions and eventually give you points.  While they do change in every game, the options of cards to put in your deck are few and run out before the game's end, which is a little unsatisfying.  The game also has a brutal catch-up mechanism where someone who is in the lead in a random category gets smacked down. Makes me wonder if it's worth memorizing the different categories, and deliberately shooting for 2nd in all of them, but that seems like too much thought for this sort of game.

This is a pretty clever deck building game where you run a resort for heroes and tourists. When you buy new cards for your deck, you remove an existing card, so you never get bloated, but you do eventually run out of cards that let you buy new cards. The cards available are limited as well, so keeping track of what your opponents need is somewhat important. Tourists and heroes spawn each turn along with cards that initiate attacks, targeting the player with the most money, heroes or vacationers. You can have the hero block the monster, in which case they take longer to score you points, or you can let the monster eat your visitors and or cause damage to your resort card. You are somewhat limited in that you can only have three resort "location" cards at the same time, and when you are getting stars to buy the meeples or heroes you aren't getting money to buy workers and locations and vice-versa. In the end I thought it was a pretty fun romp that reminded me of a better thought out version of Boss Monster.

like dominion, but not many cards are worth drafting; having all your tourists get eliminated by the dragon really isn't all that bad. cuz you get a gadjillion flair with no tourists, and buy heroes which seems to be the best strategy. in fact without money and meeples, you wont get attacked much and you have 3 peons to absorb attacks. yeah you will eventually need tourists to get gold for the upgrades, but its astongishingly of little imporatance, as the upgrades aren't that great. so its really one dimensional.

I would have liked this game a lot more if it weren't for one glaring flaw that is a very large part of the game's experience.

In this game each player is managing a resort.  Each resort has up to 3 attractions with spaces for a certain number of guests and depending on how many guests are at that attraction there is a sliding scale of the game's two resources; money and prestige.  So the more money you have the less prestige and vice versa.  More prestige gives you the ability to attract new guests and hire heroes and more money lets you get improved workers (used to staff attractions and keep guests there) and better attractions.  The heroes are needed because occasionally monsters will attack and heroes can prevent those monsters from eating guests and damaging attractions.

My biggest problem with the game is the combat, which is a pretty central part of the game.  A lot of what you do each round is preparing to defend your resort from monsters and the monster deck itself dictates the game's end.  However combat is super duper easy, you can almost ignore it and it will never affect you.  This makes a game with no tension and almost no point to that whole piece which is a central aspect of the gameplay.

When a monster attacks your resort first you can defend it with a hero.  No matter how strong the monster is the hero only takes one wound.  If there is no hero present or the monster does damage past the heroes defense (and if you are afraid of losing your hero you can always have him retreat to another attraction) then he will chomp on guests.  Even if he does 7 damage and there is only 1 guest present he will still just eat that one guest and leave.  And losing guests isn't inherently a bad thing, like I said there is a sliding scale of resources so with fewer guests you get less money but more prestige which is not a bad thing.  Then if there are no heroes and no guests, again despite how strong the monster is, it will do one damage to your attraction.  Attractions can all take 2 or 3 hits before being destroyed and there are often attractions that can self-repair or workers that can repair attractions, plus upgrading to a better attraction instantly repairs it.  And that's not all, finally each player starts with 3 cards in their deck that can completely negate an entire monster attack.

Other than that I kind of like the design of the game, there is variable setup with different workers you can use each time and a few different attractions with special abilities making for some different experiences.  But when half of the game is about these monster attacks and there is almost no point to them I can't find enough in what's left to justify playing it.

gioco bellissimo, alterna meccaniche innovative di deck-evolution a piazamento lavoratori e gestione risorse.

Much more than the deck builder it is often touted as. Epic Resort is a genuinely brilliant, thinky, bright and engaging game, with elements of hand management, worker placement, resource management, area control and push your luck even. Very interesting and huge fun. Theme integrates so well and really is a great example of how theme can be done really effectively in a game.

Interesting twist adding worker placement to a deck builder. Being a resort operator to attract fantasy hero tourists that hopefully don't get eaten by monsters... Not convinced.

Great theme, plenty of random fun, lovely art. My kids like this game, which moves it up the list too.  Down side -- until everyone knows the game pretty well, it goes kinda slowly.

Good game with awesome artwork. I really like the theme of building a resort, attracting tourists and heroes to defend it and fighting of the monsters that want to destroy it. 
It's a deck building game with a little bit of worker placement in it.
The first playthrough felt a bit too long. Maybe because some of the players don't play board games that often. Should have probably chosen another game.

Kind of a tortured deck-builder.  Acquire adventurers, earn gold, build attractions and bring in visitors, then pray that the end-of-round monster doesn't eat your fun-seekers.

There are plenty of interesting choices to make, and I really like how the tradeoff mechanisms keep you in play, even if things may not be going exactly how you had intended; however, the monsters in triplicate, which form the "game timer" Monster deck, really should be in duplicate, or possibly even just one of each, because the game just lasts too darn long. (Make sure you remember to discard a monster each time a hero is fully rested, but the game still needs a trim.)

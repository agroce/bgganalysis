Yeah its such an improvement for 2P I can barely imagine going back to original Mamma Mia.  However I don't think its better multiplayer, for that I think I'd stick with the orig.

131109. I typically dislike...as in really hate expansions but it seems to work nicely.  The additionally order cards add some spice to the game.  Currently played as 2P and I do think it at least enhances the original game at this player count.

A good little game, perhaps a might heavy for the casual gamer expecting light play. There is a requirement to card count (at least roughly), remember where your cards went in to the deck and therefore know when to help people make pizzas and when to let them fail. Certainly a good one for the gamer wanting to wind down at the end of the night without going for a completely brain dead option.

Upon hearing the rules, this memory game does not look like much, but revealing the pile of cards is a lot of silly fun. Light harmless filler, I like it. This version includes additional recipes and one more ingredient (shrimps).

RATING: 7
Adds more recipe cards and changes some of the original recipes to require more ingredients. Didn't like the recipes where you could NOT have your ingredient on the table--those felt like a random shot in the dark, especially when playing with 6 for it to work.

Have not tried the "helping" rule yet, but seems like it is a must-do for this version, as the recipes require more ingredients which, even with a larger hand, is hard to pull off on your own.

Memory game.
But unless you play with players with _very_ strong memory skills, it quickly turns into almost a party game.

I'm still hesitant if it shouldn't get a lower note.  Not so much fun in this one.

RATING: 10
An excellent addition to the "Mamma Mia" family of games.

Adds a new ingredient for a sixth player and enough rules changes to make the game fresh for new players and old-timers alike.

One of my favourite filler games.

Mamma Mia! itself is a wonderful game, but I don't feel like the new cards add anything meaningful or fun to the game, and the sharing rules are just stupid. Either make the pizza yourself, or don't make it. "Helping" other players IMO completely ruins the game.

Adds a sixth player with a shrimp(!) ingredient.  Nothing wrong with that.  Also plays with the coop rules of Sole Mio and adds new pizza recipes.  I don't prefer the helping rules in this game as it seems to make it too easy to bake nearly all your pizzas,  Maybe it just requires a different strategy, but I prefer the feel of the original game.

Uwe's second-best game, behind Space Beans? Only half kidding here. The time commitment to fun ratio is pretty off the charts. There is fun to be had in so many ways and in so many aspects of the game: trying to figure out what's left in the oven, trying to remember which ingredients your submitted orders are short of so you can accumulate them, worrying about how quickly the discard stack is running out, and especially, unloading the oven.

I can see why 6 player is not recommended -- emptying the oven drags

RATING: 9
Just to point out: I'm rating original Mamma Mia 10. 

The main elements are the same and changes are more of a flavor of original and not anything drastic like double ingrediments in Sole Mio.

The biggest changes in gameplay is new hand size of 9 cards. This most likely is because there are now 6 ingrediments and otherwise you would too often have mostly singles/doubles in hand. This gives a bit more flexibility to complete pizzas using hand cards changing gameplay a bit. Other change in rules is that there no longer is Mamma Mia -card but simply the one who took the last ingredient begins new turn. It feels powerful as you're guaranteed to have two turns in a row (and in second you're guaranteed to know what is in the oven).

I'm not sure if I like bigger hand size + helping rule combination. It feels that you sometimes could get a bit too easy points simply by hording cards to be used (for either your pizzas or) to help other players pizzas. Not a big problem as you can always simply play without the helping rule. In Sole Mio or Mamma Mia Grande helping didn't feel as easy as with Mamma Mia Plus. I'm going to play most of my games without helping.

New pizzas are better than ones in Sole Mio. I especially liked the ones where your own ingredient cannot be in oven. The new pizzas generally need more ingrediments than ones in original edition. I still prefer originals compact pizzas over these bigger ones. Option for 6. player is very nice plus too.

Overall this is a good game and must for Mamma Mia fan like me but original Mamma Mia is still a little bit more elegant and therefore best of the three.

Yet another iteration of Mamma Mia. Some of the recipes are virtually impossible to complete.

Even though the Abacus tuckboxes suck big time, it's not really an improvement to put the game in a tin several orders of magnitude larger than the original game.

Solid game and solid edition. The game play is smooth and simple and it's fun when an order comes up and you're one ingredient short. I also like that you can play with helping or not helping. Personally I prefer the helping variant, but either is fine to play.

RATING: 6.7
An interesting premise; whilst managing your hand of cards, keep a rough idea of what cards are going in to the pile and when you think the ones you need are there; throw your matching order in too. There is enough chaos going on (being able to add cards from your hand and request help) to make any memory aspect essentially useless and in the earlier rounds there is no penalty for speculatively throwing a card in so you may as well always do so. In all, the chaos seems to make the game too luck dependant and yet it runs (like Bonhanza) too long for a filler.

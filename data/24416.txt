I actually like the concept behind this game, and it's moderately entertaining to play.  

Unfortunately, you are forced to verify everyone's answer each round by stepping through the entire chain of thought.   That alone makes this game a complete deal breaker to me, particularly since this game is aimed at large groups of people.

Great graphics bring you into this game which is just a race of who can solve the puzzle fastest. I can see it would be better as a party game but I'd prefer to be playing something else instead. You need a bit of space for this too as you have to move around the table. 1 Play.

Very good party game.
But it needs room, because the variant with running around the table is much more fun.
Three levels of difficulty gives this game good replay ability. We often played it few times in a row.

Although I like this game very much, only about 50% my friends share my opinion, so better try it first. (You need some co-players, after all.)

It's a brilliant idea and its quite funny. Unfortunately it has two problems: 

1) the "stacking of the player's discs" to determine the finishing order in a speed-based game never really worked and it's also the case here; 

2) verifying the solution the way we did it takes too much time. 

This game gets an extra point for its clever use of group theory (composition of permutations produces a group). I would like to add that this group-puzzle is much more forgiving to skill differences than, say, Ricochet Robot. This is due to the fact that everybody solves a different puzzle. Sometimes you will get an easier puzzle, letting you catch-up on a more skilled player. Also, when you play the "musical chair" version (and you should), sometimes you will have to run less than others, giving you an edge. Finally, there is a memory element to the game, so you can even beat that fast-thinking-nearly-autistic-borg in your gaming group.

A light and fast game of deduction, based on a set of displayed cards; one has to find his/her way to the (right) ship using the color coded Crow's Nest, Sails, Hull or Name Plate.  The faster you are to get to your seat (the ship where your crew members ends up), the more gold you get.  After 5 rounds, the game ends.

The components are nice, but where's the fun?  It is as entertaining as watching paint dry.  Would have rated a '1', but since this mathematical puzzle is not 'broken', I had to give it a '2'.

RATING: 6
I really like the idea of Santy Anno.  I highly enjoy speed games as well as pattern recognition exercises.  Even the running around the table is fun (though it limits the types of places where you can play).

But what absolutely kills the game is the bookkeeping afterward, checking to make sure that everyone is where they're supposed to be.  A light, silly game should be easy to score, and having to do all the checking kills the momentum of the game and makes it boring for those who are just sitting and waiting.  If there could be a way to speed it up my enjoyment of Santy Anno would go up considerably.

I am not fond of puzzle games or race games. This brings those two types together. Santy Anno is more tolerable for me than Factory Fun because I at least have a hope of completing the puzzles.

This logic puzzle/speed game is probably one of the best filler games I've seen in a while.  Through a series of direction cards, players are asked to find their pirate's way from the boat they're on to the boat they SHOULD be on.  I don't usually care much for speed games but this one was much better than the norm.

RATING: 5
Although Santy Anno may seem hard to understand from a casual glance to the rules, in reality it's a straitforward party game. Mostly it is about memory and being able to quickly find a path through different motifs. The players try to solve the puzzle in real time while special cards more or less try to induce them in error. The funniest part of Santy Anno is actually running around the table to get to the place you should be. Overall, it quickly becomes stale and gives an unfair advantage to player who, having played a lot, know the ship's configurations by heart. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very fast paced game (per definition =) about matching colors, letters and performing simple mathematical operations. The problem I have with this game, although I'm OK at it, is that certain people are simply much quicker thinkers and have quicker hands than others and this seems to be a biological factor. I played several rounds and the same people were winning over and over again, no matter how hard the others were trying. Ergo: it's not a game for all people - you have to assemble a group which is composed of people with about the same amount of "skill"...

RATING: 5
There's 8 ships lying around. Each ship features a bunch of characteristics that pair with a different boat - so a boat with a red hull might pair with boat 2, also with a red hull; boat 1's green sails might pair with boat 3, and so on. In a round, you start at a set boat and then you're mentally racing through a set of cards to determine your destination boat as determined by the cards, which might be a sequence say of move to your paired hull boat, then move from there to that boat's paired sail boat, and so on. The player who completes their sequence fastest and proves correct gets 5 pts, next gets 4 and so on. Repeat for 5 rounds with the card program getting longer each time. All of which makes for an interesting mental exercise if you're a fan of mental gymnastic type games like Ricochet Robot and Set. But it ends up being pretty straightforward with not much fun or ongoing interest. Which is probably why they introduced the rule that you must get up out of your chair and run around the table to get to your destination boat. But the party people who might enjoy this aren't likely to enjoy the mental side, and those who love the mental side aren't likely to be fans of the physical side, so the game alienates a bunch of its target market. I didn't mind it as a once-off, but it holds little replay value.

Do you want to know what isn't fun for me?  Take the silent mathy speedy non-interactive calculations of Ricochet Robot add a zany party element (ala Mad Magazine the board game) of running around the table and slapjack, then wait as you move a bunch of fidly bits around the table ploting out every pirate's movement to see if people were correct.  Wheee.

I'd say that this would only be good as a kids game, but one of the characters has "FUCK BLACKBEARD" tatooed all over his body.

SA is a puzzle-party type game. There are 8 boats out, each with 4 characteristics (eg hull color, sail color. etc). Each combo (eg red hull) appears on 2 ships. Player start one one of the boats, which are arranged in random order around the table. For each of 5 rounds (r), r+4 cards are revealed. These are a sequence of instructions to move your pirate, keyed to the 4 traits (eg move to the other yellow-hulled boat). Everyone races to figure out the final position, and puts their marker there. You're supposed to play musical chairs and physically sit in the chair in front of the boat, but we played the variant whre you just put your marker there. Then, everyone solves the puzzle and people who were correct get money according to how quick they were: first correct person gets 5, then 4, 3, 2, 1. The player with the most money at the end wins.

There is an advanced version, too: more complications.

This is a PARTY game: needs to be played with musical chairs rule, and people willing to sit in each other's laps, to be most fun. As a puzzle game, I prefer MaNiKi.

I usually like speed/recognition games.  This one falls a little flat because there are too many rules to follow and it's also too chaotic for my tastes.  Also, if you enjoy double-checking answers to math problems, then the calculations after everyone has chosen a ship will be right up your alley.  Not bad, but most games of this genre are better.

[Repos Production limited (2006) edition] {Pirate; puzzle, action, real-time} Santy Anno is an interesting family game.  Players are competing to solve a linear puzzle with the hints.

Fast thinkers clearly have advantages, but he may not easily win because he has to run to the correct seat!

The bits are of high quality: sturdy, nicely illustrated (though busy), effective and large.  The graphics may be offending to some players; however, it's not a problem for me.

This is a nice try for first-time designer.  Keep up the good work!

A dangerous game to bring out because it may make some players who are naturally poor at such mental dexterity game to feel bad. 

But if players are evenly matched, the game can have some exciting moments. Coupled with movement around table, it is a lively game to play and a nice change of pace between games after sitting at the table and mulling over strategy for too long.

Very nice game that supports up to 8 people. Players have to do some mental gymnastics to move (in their head) from pirate ship to pirate ship based on some card instructions and the various colors/traits of their ships. Really good game for larger crowds as there is little down time. Only drawback is that one of the pirates has curse words tattooed on his body, which might be offensive to some people and inappropriate for children, who would otherwise be able to play this fine.

This a fairly good but silly game where you try to solve a puzzle before anyone else.  Since each player is starting from a different ship, the puzzle is different for everyone.

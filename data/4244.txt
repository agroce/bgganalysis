Just terrible rules and completely undeveloped.  Flak guns are superhuman and you can't even get half of what Frost actually had at the bridge because some really silly stacking rules.  

Some really interesting mechanics and asymetrical play provide a siren here that should not be heeded.

Such an utter and complete disappointment.

RATING: 7.5
One of the best SPI monster. Rules (2nd ed.) are a little complicated, but after some turns the game runs well. You must pay particular attention to command and supply rules (the cornerstone of the game) to avoid a premature defeat.
Artillery seems too powerful (expecially if trincerated in woods) and with historical restrictions on the frontage of British XXX Corps, the allied task is a little bit harder.
The key point is, obviously, on the maps with Arnhem and Nijmegen, where the Allied forces must resist against overwhelming German forces, waiting for the relieving XXX Corps.

A great subject at a very cool map scale and company size units, but the designers went overboard. The game is far too complex, and the sequence of play is over elaborate to the point of absurdity. Much streamlining was needed during this game's development.

This was a huge purchase for me as a teenager and I could never have conceived getting anyone to play it with me so I never tried. I think this was one of the manuals I pulled out, showing it to someone and pointing out all the fine print.

I remember taking a summer afternoon and setting up a game then losing interest but promising myself to "get back to it" and pushing the map and all the counters under the couch. A few weeks later my mom wondered what the heck was going on when she moved the couch to reveal the paper map, paper counters and dustbunnies. Were there giant dustbunnies in WW2?

Played this in college when it first came out.  We had eight players and full length map across classroom tables for a weekend.  Hard to say whether the flawed 1st edition or inexperience caused more problems, but everyone had fun.  Every map situation had its ups and downs.  Red Devils actually did pretty well, as did 101st.  But XXXth Corps had delayed breakout and 82nd blew Nijmegen badly.  Because it was new to everybody, it was kind of unclear how things were going overall for either side.  I'm glad the game was cleaned up because the visual display is spectacular.  Story I heard on that was it was J.A. Nelson's project, but he was an actor and got cast in a touring play.  So he baled, and others had to jump in to get game out.  That's life, Nelson was always one of my favorites because he's so history oriented and puts that first in his games.

We always game with 4 players and Yikes!, this can be a hairball for the poor kraut tasked with delaying 30 Corps. One small change restricted the unlimited movement rule to 24 road hexes because a funky network of un-ZOC'ed roads venturing thither and yon about the game board enabled an "instant win" for the Brits. The un-limited rule makes no sense anyway. In a life or death situation, even with the prodding of your general officer, you tend to advance with some caution into danger. Fun game lots of action and scarce resources with which to contend gives everyone something to do.

The 21 December 1976 first edition and 1977 "second edition" by SPI seemed like a real winner--had breathtaking graphics, a wonderful tactical system (despite some well-known flaws), and dramatic scenarios.  Regarding the latter, the best ones involved the 82nd and the 1st Airborne Divisions--the rest were just okay as tutorials.  The campaign game fell quite flat and that was the major limitation of the game. We kept trying it, however.  Superseded by the Decision Games remake and MMP's super-sized THE DEVIL'S CAULDRON/WHERE EAGLES DARE combo, if you can find the table space! Sold both my punched and mint copies.

We tried to play it, but the overwrought system defeated me and my friends.  Worst product of the old SPI system, with gamey systems that are complex and don't reflect reality (how about those great anti-infantry guns, the 17 pdr's...not!)

Name of the day:  Monster, Monster, Monster Game!  More, gives me more!  2,000 counters...ain't it more?  Hope Decision Games can update it soon.  In the meanwhile, I'll stick to VG's "Hell's Highway" on Operation Market Garden.   Decision Games is going to update this SPI game. In addition to updating the maps and counters, Joe Youst will be making some improvements to the originals rules including a compression of the time scale to three-hour turns, use of hill tops for spotting and possibly opportunity fire, and unit proficiency ratings (i.e. this will be an update of the original, not a change in the game design).

This is the ultimate Operation Market-Garden game. Some confusing rules, but there are several internet sites with great ideas on how to make the game more playable. One of my biggest problems with the game has been counter clutter. You know when you have 4 units stacked in one hex...each has taken a strength point loss and each has been depleted. That&#039;s a nice, tidy stack of 12 counters to mess with. To try and lessen this problem I&#039;ve made up some strength sheets, a.k.a. the TSS system BCE sheets. Makes for a little more paperwork but it does keep some counters off the map. Nothing worse than having a couple of those monster stacks go flying because of an flapping shirt cuff!!!

RATING: 5
Not the worst monster game to escape from SPI, that award goes to Decent on Crete, but this one does come close. If you must play it do it right with the 2nd edition rules. Better yet, get Victory Games' Hell's Highway, a more superior game in every way.

RATING: 4
Played extensively when the game first came out. Amazing scope and a joy to see laid out on the table but the system is overly complex and produces an experience that is disappointing. Definitely does a poor job at simulating the battle, but the game is visually stunning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A complex monster, for it's time the components were good.  Second edition rules much better than the first, still an unforgiving game, that can really penalize a person who is careless with his HQ units.  Long since surpassed by newer Market Garden games, this still holds a place in my heart, and for that reason it might hit the table again sometime.

My Las Vegas crew and I played this a number of times and loved it, although I'm sure I drove the SPI staff nuts with my various errata letters (hi, Eric!); they sent me a copy of the 2d edition rules to show their joy.  I'd love to tackle this baby again someday, preferably in its reissued format.

Excellent game.  Just the Arnhem map alone is a game in itself.  Cool thing is with 5 players: 1 for XXX Corps, 1 for the Germans, 1 for 82nd Airborne, 1 for the 101st Airborne and 1 for the "Red Devils" British 1st Airborne with Polish Airborne Brigade.  Allies: defend those Drop Zones!  Germans: send in those SS units ASAP to block those bridges and prevent XXX Corps from linking up with those Airborne boys!

Played scenarios, never finished the whole monster. It is an absorbing system, with great maps. The second edition is playable and a good use of SPI's time and dollars to fix the rushed rules. (I originally had the 2nd edition soap box, which I parted with in 1986. I now have a 1st edition flat pack, with second edition rules and add-ons.)

Market-Garden at the company level. One of the original SPI monster games, and it looks like one - good components for the time, not great by today's standards. The core of the game mechanics aren't too complex, but there are a lot of fiddly details that must be taken into account: para-drops, supply, supply, supply, functional modes for units which will yield certain advantages and disadvantages, weather, air superiority, and did I mention supply? I've only dreamed about playing the campaign game, but the scenarios covering the battles for each of the bridges are good enough reason to get the game. Better games may have come out since this one, but there's a little extra magic playing one of the originals.

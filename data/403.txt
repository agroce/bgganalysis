I am a big fan of unique dexterity games.  Hamsterrolle and Toc Toc Woodman being very high up there... but I really like this simple little flicky game.  The artwork is just fun and the gameplay changes based on what table you are playing on.  Simple and entertaining, appropriate for most any age.

Apparently better with 2 sets for 3 or 4 players. not that flicking moose steps around a pub table is ever a boring thing? Don't start too far away from each other!

Not my cup o' tea.  I really like Crokinole and I like Pitch Car, but this one is too light for me.  I'd say it's a nice, quick two-player game.  Maybe good for younger kids (who can handle flicking wooden discs around, of course)?  Just doesn't do anything for me.

Fun, fun, fun, game to play! Right now this is my favorite flicking game to play. I think it is way over priced at $15 to $20 since you only get two wooden moose, two stands, and six wooden discs. Other than that gripe, this is a fun and ultra portable game!

I originally wanted this game becuase of the adorable mooples.  I thought it would be a fun and light filler game.  While it still makes me smile when we get it out, it's not quite the perfect game after a stressful day at work that I thought it would be- probably becuase I'm not dexterous and always lose.

RATING: 5
As the only dexterity game in the Kosmos 2-player series, this one deserves some credit.  It is not a particularly strong game, but can be fun for kids.  Also makes an iteresting partners game if partners alternate who gets to flick the stone.  This gets more interesting if the partners can't talk about the plan.  Simple flicking fun.  [GTI Code: TPSL]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tentative rating base on early play.  This is way more fun than it should be.  It is vitally important to know the name of your moose and keep them straight.  This is definitely a game that would go well with beer or playing with children.  Plays with 2 but you can always buy an additional game and paint the pieces.  Of course then you need to come up with the names for the two new moose...

Quite a fun filler type game, feels to be missing something however I am unable to put my finger on it and the rules as to when the moose falls in the water could have been made much better, it does not pay really to bother knocking an opponent down the majority of the time

Simple, fast, fun. It's also quite flexible in how and where you play. The game you get straight out of the box is basic. I can think of endless creative ways to take the mechanic and expand the gameplay.

RATING: 6
I really do like Elchfest.  It's a great if extremely light dexterity game, and one in which the dexterity component is de-emphasized due to the game being so very light and not at all serious---even people who say "I'm no good at dexterity games" don't mind it with Elchfest.  I've also been stuck at home due to an overwhelming amount of work, and it's a perfect solitaire game to "flick" while waiting for builds to complete.

I want another copy to paint for more players.

I also think this is just part of a hankering for a real Crokinole board.  Still, Elchfest is much easier to play when in a "relaxed" state of mind, and much more portable to where you go to be in a relaxed state of mind.

Not a bad little game, if you enjoy (or tolerate) "finger-flicking" or dexterity games.  It is primarily a game of "keep away" since you try to steal the stepping stones from your opponent to make it hard for him to move his elk.  Personally, I prefer several other flicking games over Elk Fest.

A delightful little dexterity game for two.  Sometimes, though, a moose can fall down when no one even so much as touches him, resulting in the active player swearing up and down that it was not his or her fault.  In any event, though, a very fun, quick little game that I enjoy immensely.

Eh. As these dexterity games go, not great by a long shot, but cheap at least, not as components-intensive as Carabande, and more in the "filler" category. Nothing on Carabande, to which it is vaguely similar, that's for sure. As a cute, occasional game it's OK, but there just isn't a lot there, even by the standards of "dexterity" games.

Hermann Huber- Its short, fun, and accessible to all.
We play this to win and it can bring out the best/worst in us.  
There are already plenty of strategies and house rules that we've created.
Edit:This game is the kind of game that made me want to be a gamer as a kid.  The best thing about it is that is brings out the kid in me still.  
It's simple(Dare we say elegant?).  
Loves house rules. 
Most importantly, everyone that plays it smiles.
T&E, PoF, and Puerto Rico (which I love) haven't produced that same effect for me.
Get two copies and play four player. :thumbsup:

Despite my low rating, I do like this game.

Very well-made, silly, enjoyable. Only problem is I'm never drawn to it and it never sees play. It is, however, the only portable flicking game I own (but Pitchcar, Crokinole, and Le Passe-Trappe are in a league of their own). Works well for children, but it doesn't capture most adults after the initial appeal of the craftsmenship. I'd just as soon play paper football.

The components are great. The rules are marvelously simple. And I like dexterity games....so that about wraps it up. Things I like about Elchfest are 1) that it plays so quickly, 2) that it is very conducive to light chatter while you play and 3) that there is a bit of fun tactical play in where you position the pieces to make things tough for your opponent. I'd be up for this one anytime.

[18 plays] I'm not a big fan of dexterity games, but I've become fond of this one.  It's fun, it plays very quickly, so I don't have time to get bored with it, and it lends itself well to plenty of trash talk and silliness.  I'm always looking to add variety to our 2-player repertoire, and this game does that very nicely.  I can beat my SO at this regularly, but I got annihilated by my brother, who found that the paper-football experience of his misspent youth served him well.

This is a dexterity game where you flick 'stones' to allow your moose to get across a 'river'.  It is definitely reminiscent of high school cafeteria tabletop games involving quarters and paper footballs.  

The bits are remarkable. The gameplay is OBVIOUS -- just one look at the bits, and you know how to play.  The laughter is non-stop.  It's amazing how much you have to adapt to how your opponent plays.  I hate to attribute any kind of strategy to a game based on FLICKING, but it sneaks in.

If you want just plain fun... join the Elk Fest. Best moose party in town.

RATING: 7
Elk Fest is a super-cute dexterity flicking game that is just right for a 15 minute filler window.  Things can be fairly matched if not for the unpredictability of where the flicks are going to go.  It's a bit hard to get good flicks in at points and it's best to be able to walk around the table. This game works very well when played fast! I do see its limitations, however. It's fairly obvious that when a player gets the upper hand that they're going to win anyway. So their opponent can simply flick their third stone away each turn and be a right jackass about it. Thus, EF shouldn't be a game to play to win but just a game to play for fun. As a fun game, it succeeds quite nicely.

There were surprisingly more options than I expected there to be, but ultimately this is a game where your inability to flick accurately screws you over, and that means I can't rate it very highly.

RATING: 7
With immediate table appeal, Elk Fest looks like a silly game you just have to try. Interestingly enough, it's surprisingly tactical while still being short enough not to overstay its welcome. 

Each player receives a wooden moose (not an elk; long story explained in the directions), three round, flat discs which will be flicked, and a platform for your moose to stand on. Each turn, you will get two flicks of the various discs (stepping stones for your moose) and do not have to flick only your own. The goal is to create a path of stones that your moose can walk across. Generally you will have to make decisions about whether to try a tougher flick of your opponents stones which makes it harder for them, or an easier flick of your own stones which makes it easier for you. Moving and positioning your moose on desirable stones is also key. Despite all of that, it's really flicking skill that rules the day. You won't find the tactical depth of something like Crokinole here. 

Nevertheless, it plays quickly, is nicely portable, and creates some good tense moments and laughter. It's very easy to play a few games in a row and get caught up in trying to win. As a two-player filler game, it's tough to beat, but there are many better alternatives if you like a bit more depth in your dexterity games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First off, you don't get much in this one: 8 pieces of wood (2 moose, 2 quai and 6 discs).  It's a game you can play on any smooth surface table, including the school's cafeteria.

We should have a "very light" Game Play weight, as this game would fit right in there!

RATING: 5
A cute, small flicking fun dexterity game. While I'm more of a stacker when it comes to dexterity, I still think that PitchCar wins in this category. The only reason I could see myself owning this (again) is if I needed a flicking game that traveled lightly and didn't require much space -- which this game succeeds wonderfully at. The bits are *cute* though.

Feb09: Well, that wasn't as fun as I'd hoped.  Maybe I wasn't in the right mood, but I don't think that was it.

Mainly, it's just a little too boring.  You can't really screw with the other moose enough.  I played Hula Hippos and Sorry Sliders the very next day.  Those both had suspense and strategy.  Elk Fest did not.

Alas, oh well.  For trading it shall go.

Haha, oh this game is sooo funny. It's a nice light game and I love mooses. It probably wouldn't be as fun if you were a serious kind of gamer and didn't enjoy stupid things like trying to get your moose across a river by flicking stones.

But me and my sister loved it. We were cracking up and laughing at the mooses when they fell in the water or we flicked a stone way too far.

Not to be played serious. Just for fun and laughs.

FUN flicking game. I was surprised by it. Great components, simple rules. Short play time and lots of laughs. This is a 2 player game ONLY, I wouldn’t want to play the more players variant. I really like the variant in which players can’t leave their seat, they have to flick the discs however they can :devil:.

For now, Elk Fest is a borderline 7.0 to me. I want to play more.

I knew what I was getting when I bought it...a silly little dexterity game.

Upon our very first play I thought to myself "oh uh...this just isnt going to be much fun." But...we have had a real good time playing this one. It is very quick to play so sometimes when we just have ten minutes to kill we break it out. My wife keeps the pieces in her purse and we play at bars and restaurants while we wait for our food. 

I didn't think my friends would get it either. They arrived as my wife and I were wrapping up a game and suddenly they were all demanding to play! It has really gone over well. I am in the process of making a second set so we can play 4 at once for more chaos!

There is zero depth but it is exactly what a game is supposed to be...fun.

A game of dexterity with few components including 2 adorable wooden moose named Ole and Jule that spend the entire game trying to keep their hooves from getting wet while crossing a cold raging river.  How could I resist?  UPDATE:  We've noticed a considerable amount of turn angst during the mid-game as the moose attempt to pass each other and each player tries to best utilize or scatter the various stones near by.  This has lead to some serious line-of-sight analysis paralysis in this household.

May consider purchasing a second set to paint differently to include more than 2 players.

The portability is a big plus, making this easy to play just about anywhere with a table.  But since I play most of my games at home, I can't imagine a time when I would choose to play this over Zopp or Crokinole or something more substantial.

I haven't played this using the official components, so it could be argued that I haven't played it at all. The general experience of flicking discs back and forth across a table to inch your piece towards the other side is one I rate not great enough for repeated plays, though I'm open to it being a little better with optimal components and a smaller playing area, so I'm erring on the side of generosity.

Funny dexterity game of getting an Elk to the other side of the river. Players take turns flicking stones to make a path for their moose to cross the river.

Carrom at its best. Flick the discs and then balance your elk on them to get to your opponents base before they get to yours. Lots of fun here as both players own all the discs except those upon which an elk is standing and do their damndest to flick them into position to their best advantage. Owning two sets allows a 4 player version with the bases in a X position to one another. A fun ice breaker game, ideal for non-gamers.

Another in Kosmos' successful two-player lineup, players attempt to help their moose across a river by flicking wooden disks into position so as to create 'stepping stones' from one end of the table to the other. If you flick well, you'll be able to move your moose quicker than your opponent. But you must be careful not to make the gap too large, as the miniature wooden moose can only span a relatively small distance.

A fun little two-player filler flicking game. While there are a few edge cases that you'll end up having to look up the first time or two you play, the rules are very straightforward, overall, and the tactical choices you have to make because the pucks you flick are used by all players are interesting.

While Elk Fest is not as good as Crokinole or Pitchcar, it's worth playing a few times. Probably best to play it on a 1-2 foot wide surface to keep playing time under control while keeping some challenge.

There are a million dexterity/balancing games out there, but a limited number of dexterity/flicking games. After Crokinole (the best), Carrom, or Carabande, what other choices are there? This one is one of the most aproachable, portable, and inexpensive choices out there. It's pretty challenging, however, and newbies can get a little frustrated. The "ah-ha!" moment at the game's crossover point--when you figure out neither player "owns" the flicking disks--is a highlight.

To paraphrase Will Rogers--I've never met a flicking game I didn't like--and this silly little game is no exception. I enjoy the way it breaks into three distinct phases: the opening, the mid-stream encounter, and the endgame rush to the finish. Hey, kinda like chess! Maybe not.

We've had many a wet moose and a few over the falls in our games, which have been the cause of much merriment. How many occasions in life afford the opportunity to chant "Wet moose! Wet moose! Wet moose!" with utter abandon, now I ask you? One small quibble: wish there was the option of using a seventh stepping stone (it's not like it wouldn't have fit in the box). [7 plays]

Picked up a copy of the German version with the "Imported By Mayfair Games" sticker on the cover. Includes English rules. $3.00 at a thrift store. Not too shabby, I think, and will likely go over well as a light lunchtime game in the classroom during the school year.

-----------

After a couple of plays: for a fast (>15min) filler that involves dexterity, this was surprisingly fun - lots of cheering, an occasional tactical decision, and very close games. It's a keeper.

Silly but surprisingly funny dexterity game (it can wake sleepy players up) where players have got to flick the stones along which two elks can step on to cross a "river". Some tactical play shows up after a couple of rounds, since players learn how to stand in their opponent's way, how to flick the interesting discs away, and how to leave the elk in a good position to advance after every flicked disc.

I'm not overly convinced about the monetary value of a box with ten bits of wood in it, but in a suitable frame of mind, this is uproarious fun - a lowbrow Polarity, if you will. Play it with the right person and the benefit of a few drinks; cries of laughter and shouts of 'wet moose!' will echo into the night.

OK, this is not rocket science, and needs a nice smooth table, but the game is funny... the first time I saw a moose faceplant off his rock I was momentarily disconcerted because there was no "splash" from the river...

The game is fun, but really simple. People always stop to look at what you are playing. It is good that they kept it to 15 minutes, because it does become a little repetitive, although for people who want to play longer, they can simply put more distance between the riverbanks at the start. All in all, a silly game that plays fast, is easy to explain and draws a lot of comments.

I always struggle a little with rating dexterity games, and this is no exception.  At the end of the day, all you're doing is trying to make precise flicks of wooden disks...just like Catacombs, and Disc Duelers, and Crokinole, and a million other flicking games.  
That said, not particularly innovative or challenging.  The game itself is pretty slight, although the component quality is very good.  
Just above average.

My main issue is that it is just iterative skill tests.  There is no real opportunity for a clever play, just a well executed obvious play.

RATING: 10
From the moment I saw this game I knew I would like it but for some reason I always passed on adding it to my large and growing order lists. After doing this for almost a year, I finally got around to picking it up and I'm more than satisified. The game is very simple and mostly mindless but it's also quick, fun, highly portable, somewhat challenging, and provides occassional opportunities for clever tactical play. It is easily introduced to and, more importantly, happily played by non-gamers of pretty much any age. For instance, children as young as four or five can understand the game and play fairly competitively and younger kids will want to play as well but may not be quite ready yet. And then it's just fun to see them try. Definitely recommended.

I enjoy flicking dexterity games.  The thing about Elchfest though... you can make your own very simply.  All you need are two four-legged animal/dinosaur figures, 2 starting tiles, and 6 Crokinole discs.  In fact, I just made my own version that I call Tiger Crossing.

An ok game, though we're not a fan of flicking games.

RATING: 6.5
A very quick flicking game that emphasizes position-control vs. shot-control. That is, you need to be able to place the stones in precise locations, rather than shoot in a particular direction or hit targets to get particular rebound effects. The main tactical choices come down to deciding whether you should flick to help yourself or hurt your opponent. With skill, of course, you will be able to do both of those more often.

Fun, quick game; but I prefer making cool shots to making precise ones. I'd rather play Crokinole or Taktika.

RULES
Each player starts with their moose on their platform, with 3 river stones next to the platform. Alternate turns flicking the stones twice and/or moving your moose once (only moves on platforms or stones; back feet move to where front feet were previously). There are just a few exceptions: (1) the player taking the very first turn of the game gets just 1 flick; (2) your initial 3 flicks must be to the 3 stones on your side of the table in their starting positions. If you ever make a moose touch the table OR if you flick a stone off the table, your turn ends immediately; return moose/stones to previous position; other player gets 3 flicks. The first player to get their moose (front and back legs) to the opposite platform wins!

Elk Fest is an entertaining little filler. It will never be the focus of a game session, but is perfect for filling the odd few minutes while waiting for somebody to show up or a game to finish. Basically you just flick little wooden disks into position so that your moose can move across the table. The moose must move so that his front feet and back feet rest on different disks.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Amusing but one-dimensional dexterity game in which players must flick "stone" discs to create a path for their moose, which must reach the opponent's starting platform. Knocking a moose down, or trying to cross a too-large gap, results in a wet moose and an extra flick for the opposition.

It gets better with more competitive play, since the push-your-luck race aspect encourages risky plays with more chance of a wet moose. There isn't much scope for strategy, however, nor interplay variability, so it's not in the same league as other flicking games, like Flicochet or Taktika. The main advantages over the competition are the cute factor and that it's quite self-contained; there's no reason to do power shots that knock discs off the table. Since we generally play in the pub, that's important.

RATING: 5
[RGG edition] {Animal, filler, couple; action} Elk Fest is a good flicking game.  In addition to the dexterity elements, it provides some tactical decisions for the players such as where to put the stones, using a stone to hit another, etc. Nothing really special but it can quite fun with appropriate players.  However, personally, I prefer Maus nach Maus and Pitchcar because I have more fun in these 2 games.

RATING: 7
This is a fun, lighthearted little two player dexterity game.  It gets high marks for being simple and very fast.  If it were any longer it wouldn't be as good.  Like most dexterity games (in fact more than most) the game could be ruined by an overly competitive player fudging stone positions to his advantage.  So long as you treat it as a very lighthearted filler and just have fun with it, it works great.

This has the same problem for me as Hula Hippos. It is a little too difficult for what it is. It has enough frustration that it takes away from the limited fun.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

Alright well how silly is this game? But then again look closely at my ratings/comments and you'll find I like silly games! Pretty cool and can be played with any age ranges. Flicking stones...silly! :)  I am thinking of getting another copy of this just so I can paint them with like Stripes and Polka Dots...then do a 4 player game. Thinking with that many players may need to go to 2 stones per player so there's not an unusually crazy amount of  options out there or perhaps keep it at 6 stones but put them in a small circle in the center...i dunno have to try and it and see.

I originally had this pegged as a 6, but on subsequent plays the rating goes up.  There is some strategy and thought involved, and this is a really great game for pub play (as long as you have smooth tables).  One house rule we had to adopt is "the Moose may not stand on any stone that has not been flicked" to avoid people taking three steps on their first turn.  Tons of fun, and a great break from the more intense brain-burners.

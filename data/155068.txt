This was quite fun! I like the PVP and drafting of items and characters, as well as the way the quests seem to work. Game plays pretty quickly, too, turn to turn, which is always a plus with these things. Somewhat disappointed at all the KS stuff; just means even if I pick it up, I'll feel it's not quite complete. Oh well, I guess that's just the nature of the beast these days...

On a fait une campagne complète sur 3 jours.
Comptez entre 1 et 2h pour chaque scénario.

Monté des héros en puissance sympa avec l'achat de matériel en fin de scénario pour le scénario suivant et règles simples à assimilées.

Par contre petit bémol pour le dernier scénario qui est en fin de compte le moins intéressant et trop tourné PvP à notre gout.

My friends really enjoy playing this game. Competitive is always fun, but we retweaked rules to create a fun, yet challenging coop experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow, great game! Absolutely awesome components and nice artwork. The rules are not that difficult, but there are many little rules you have to remember. So for the first few scenarios a look into the rule book is probably inevitable. The many scenarios, characters and weapons in the game offer a good amount of re-playability. It's dice driven, so there's a heavy dose of luck involved, the strategic part is bigger than the luck part, though. It can be frustrating some times when the dice don't roll as planned, but if you're not too much into winning and enjoy the game play itself it's not that big of a deal. If you like skirmishing and screwing other players, this game is for you. Some times there is negotiation and teaming up needed to stop the player which is about to win, only to get into this position yourself, right after that. If you're playing a campaign you can watch your guild grow and become better with the time. In every scenario there are multiple ways to earn points, so if you don't do well in the first scenarios you can make it up later. The only thing that can be a hassle is the time needed for the set-up. If you have an insert and everybody helps setting up the next scenario it's not that bad, though. 

In short:
• awesome art and components
• dice driven, but strategic
• lots of little rules; difficult at the beginning
• high re-playability
• multiple ways to earn points
• set-up may take a while
• often frustating with two players

Really fun game with the right crowd. Best played with 4 due to the simetrical board layouts, but slow players can really kill it. 

I like the mix of scenario objectives, pvp, upgrades, etc. I dislike when the game bogs down and becomes overlong because of particularly difficult objectives or too many armor upgrades.

This game is awfully fun. It is essentially a "tongue in cheek" version of Descent:  Journeys in the Dark, 2nd edition ... but player vs player rather than player(s) vs overlord and without much of a story.  Gloomhaven and Mage Knight have replaced Descent for me, with Arcadia Quest filling the niche for me for when I want to battle my buddies rather than working together.

1st play: First play with Wife, 9 and 7 yr old. The 9 year old really liked it, she had fun picking her guild and the fact that there were girl heroes to choose from was a big selling point for her. I really liked the art style and tongue-in-cheek delivery of the characters and plot line.  The game is dead simple, and I'll be interested to see how well the game goes over with gamers.

2nd play: Probably the best dudes on a map, dungeon crawly game I have played.  The action is fast, the exploding dice are excellent, and the PvE objectives are hard.  When you complete them it feels like an accomplishment.  Each mission completed allows you to strengthen and grow your heroes without allowing the winner to run away with the game.  I wish the minis were painted already, I may have to try my hand.

A fun dungeon crawl with minis. The 15-ish minute setup time makes it hard for me to bring this to the table; When a game can only last 45-70 minutes it's less frequent that I want to take it out.

I find that the luck of dice doesn't appeal much to me. While they often roll in my favor, I feel bad for others when they don't.

I also find that I don't really care about miniatures one way or the other. They're neat... and have resulted in some funny moments but eh.

RATING: 8
Setup time takes a little too long to hit the table as often as liked. But when it does it's enjoyable. However, some maps have PvE objectives where one is much easier and quicker than the other. Some people may not like the common occurance where a player will achieve the easier one and pretty much have the game locked up because of that.

Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.

I like the simple game play. The game doesn't feel complete if you don't play the campaign, so I definitely recommend doing the campaign. Edit Mar 2016: Started a campaign, getting through 2 games. That's a much better way to play, as it adds some extra thought to how to play, in the form of good and bad consequences.

Finally got to actually play this at KublaCon. It is everything I knew it would be. It feels like the lite zany aspects of a game like Mario Kart mixed with a dungeon crawl. Unfortunately my painting project of it is ongoing so it will not hit my table until it's complete. Which is extra tragic since the KS for Inferno goes up two days from right now.

Increasing my score. Got to play a micro campaign of this which is where the game really sings. Really wish I could play more often.

Se trata de un juego muy divertido y sencillisimo de jugar. Permite un montón de combos interesantes combinando los innumerables personajes que vienen (al menos en la edición Kickstarter).

No se trata de un dungeon crawl al uso (aunque pueda parecerlo). En realidad las misiones son sencillas y todos los jugadores compiten entre ellos por cumplirlas antes que nadie. Una vez comienza la partida todo esta permitido (incluso atacar/robar a otros jugadores). Hay que hacer lo que sea por convertirse en el nuevo señor todopoderoso de la ciudad de Arcadia!!

Muy divertido!

RATING: N/A
This seemed like it had promise, and it was "kinda" fun, but I ended up feeling like there wasn't much for me to do. I always felt one move short of where I needed to be, and if I did get somewhere useful for a change, the dice would mess me up. Too much random die rolling for my taste. 

I only played one game, and I imagine it would be more fun if I played a campaign, but I don't have a regular gaming group, so that's not an option for me. As a single game, I'd rate this a 5; however, since it's designed to be played as a campaign, I'll reserve judgment.

Almost the perfect balance of co-operation and competition, as well as single session and campaign play. Each "quest" is relatively quick once you get used to the rules, but it's moreish, so you'll end up doing multiple quests in a sitting. And a full campaign is only 6 quests, so you can do it in a weekend!

The BEST board game I have have help to kickstart. Period. While I have not kickstarted a lot of games, quite a fair bit of my games are the kickstarter edition.

The sad things is that most games are not as good as advertised and fall short of expectations. Arcadia Quest delivered. The only thing about the campaign was the shipping cost was way too high. Hopefully this is something that CMON can work on in the upcoming campaigns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial Impression: This is my first experience with a CMON game and I'm pleasantly surprised. The components are of the same quality as FFG with thick cardboard tokens and nice quality cardstock. The minis are incredibly detailed and look fun to paint. This game is a fun tactical minis game with emphasis on "fun". The rules are light and can be absorbed in minutes. The characters each have interesting powers and mixing and matching will lead to some interesting decisions. Overall the game has a "videogame" feel to it, as your team runs around popping the mobs and other players in a frantic race to collect gold and complete your quests. I'm very impressed with the game as it was more fun than I had originally expected.

Fun - but PvPvE is a bit misleading. It is definitely PvP. The "E" are just road bumps that can be utilized to score victory points and / or resources.

Arcadia Quest is a fun and light "all-out-brawl" sort of game. You maneuver your clan of 4 heroes and attack monsters and other clans, while collecting items and gold.

By far the funnest part of the game is spending your hard-earned gold at the end of a particular quest to get improved gear. The gear is varied and remains exciting throughout the campaign.

The biggest down-side to the game is the amount of luck involved in attacking and defending. Every time you roll a critical, you get to roll the dice again, and if you get another one, you roll again, and again. Sometimes you can cause devastating damage just out of sheer luck, and this has turned off a lot of people who I have played with.

If you are OK with the possibility of dying frequently due to your lack of luck or due to the incredible luck of your opponents, then this game should be a worthy addition to your library.

Arcadia Quest is one of a kind.  It is simple, but my wife and I have played this game with a surprising amount of strategy.  

I strongly feel that the game can be enjoyed fully without the kickstarter expansions.  The 12 characters that come with the base games give a substantial variety of gameplay.  Your team of characters can be different every game, which shakes things up every game.

I just love this title, and I recommend it to all levels of gamers.

This game is fun, plays quick, and is easy to teach! It even has a cool level up system to completely customize how your character plays which can totally change each campaign you play.

RATING: 10
Very fun take on dungeon crawl.  I really like the single action turn as it keeps downtime very short.  In a 4 player campaign the PVE quests tend to be ignored or overlooked due to the ease of hunting down enemy heroes.  

We finished playing through the base game campaign recently.  One player won 5 of the 7 scenarios and the other two were won by a second player.  I'm starting to worry that there is a snowball effect as those that win often have more coins and upgrade faster than other players.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
This game perfectly replicates a hack and slash video game (Castle crashers?) into a boardgame.  You solve the puzzle how to optimize your hero actions, you kill a bunch of bad guys & get a bunch of loot.  The game is a bit fiddly since there is no "bad guy" turn, but once you get the hang of it all, the game runs pretty smooth.  Definitely fun for what it is, and I do expect to play the heck out of it.

This looks like a really fun competitive dungeon crawl. It's nice because you can bring as much "take that" to the game as you want.Going to play it with 2, but probably really shines with 3 or 4.

Awesome game! really fun, dice deppendant.
Bit long setup, bit long gameplay on late scenarios (4-6).
A couple borken rules/items, had to house-rule some situations.
Gorgeous miniatures and general art (if you like chibbi of course).
Highly recommended to get extra heroes

This is a campaign game where you take your team of heroes through multiple missions over (probably) multiple play sessions. Game play is on a grid with dice combat. There are quests to kill the other players and a quest specific for each mission which everyone races to complete. 

A fun legacy game and fairly well balanced from mission to mission, keeping people who do well from rocketing ahead. There are some OP characters (we've noticed Spike), and getting a lot of defense is generally OP in late game. 

Acquiring loot and harder enemies makes playing multiple missions exciting and different as you keep playing through a campaign.

I really wanted to love this game, seriously. But in my opinion this design is not balanced at all, the scenarios are becoming longer and longer as well as more and more boring and the boss fight is a desaster. No catch-up mechanic over a complete campaign, if you're unlucky you suck for six plays. Setup time and the organization of the box are also a bad joke.

VERY fun to play. I got this at PAX East 2016 and we then played a game (with most rules wrong because they were demo'd wrong accidentally and we didn't read the rulebook before starting) then 3 stages of the campaign over the course of the weekend. Then I got home and Allan and I started another campaign and played 2 stages.

It is most fun when you don't care about winning and are just running around having a good time. Vinny and Allan had a ridiculous rivalry that went on a long time, which was pretty funny but caused them to lose the game. We keep getting rules wrong, because there are a LOT, but I honestly continue to love the game even with wrong rules. Most important is to play for fun! 

Update: just finished a full campaign with Allan. I got 5/5 medals (we shared 1) and he got 1/5 but won the final scenario. I guess I can see why people find it frustrating, but we honestly had a great time with the whole campaign. We actually recorded which cards we have so that we can do the poison dragon expansion when it arrives! We might do a 2 player variant that includes a 3rd PvE quest (probably "kill 3 monsters" just to make the games last a tiny bit longer. The 5th scenario, Allan really wanted to complete one of the PvE's, but ended up finding a quest token really early, so he went to take it back to his starting area. I tried to steal it but he killed me instead, so when he got to the starting area he was actually disappointed that he won, since the game had barely happened. But that was all luck of the quest token placement to be honest. Seriously awesome game!

Really excited to crack the box on this one. I love the aesthetics of the not-quite-anime chibi style, and this is one of Eric Lang's cleanest, most accessible "big game" designs.

I really love Arcadia quest. From the light nature to the miniatures to the combat mechanisms, to the PvEvP, to the expandability, to the campaign mode. The only problem for me is how much of a bear this is to pack and unpack from the box, im serious there is sooo much stuff to cram in the box that i dread getting it off the shelf. so sadly it goes unplayed way more often than i would like. i know its a ridiculous complaint but it is what it is otherwise id give this game a solid 9

The permanence between games is interesting, and roll post decision, which I almost always hate, works here in the context of kill and treasure stealing.

The downside is the range of players who I would enjoy playing this type of game with is not enormous, and to fully enjoy, you need to play six games of it with exactly four players.

I quite like this game but it has some big flaws to me. Feels a bit like Wiz-war plus.

Pros:
-Good mechanics.
-No player needs to be the GM.
-Artwork on cards and miniatures looks great.

Cons:
-No rubber banding. Player in the lead is probably going to win. This is exacerbated in campaign mode where the player with the most gold and items has a big advantage.
-Not really cooperative at all. Very competitive.
-Some scenarios take a long time to play.
-Quite a lot of setup required.
-Could do with more map tiles - after a couple of games it gets a bit samey.

The most fun in this game is the upgrade phase that happens between scenarios where you spend your hard earned gold on items after a bit of card drafting. The actual scenarios are fun with the game being fresh (set apart from similar games like Descent) because there is no co-op and a good bit of it is PVP. The death curses are a fun way to give hero death some weight and the monsters only activating off player actions is unique.  The minis are also really cool and give the board a "hordes of monsters wow" factor. Hoping my rating goes up after I finish a campaign.

Che siate o meno degli amanti di chibi (io non lo sono) questo gioco ha qualcosa di speciale. La meccanica a campagne funziona molto bene, gli scenari sono abbastanza diversificati e il gioco non si prende ne troppo seriamente ma neanche troppo poco seriamente, si gioca tranquillamente e si agisce spesso come delle vipere pronte a colpire alle spalle gli altri giocatori. Arcadia Quest ricorda in parte alcuni giochi online nella sua meccanica, si rivela veloce e piacevole sia per piccoli e grandi giocatori.

The production is fantastic! If you don't take the game to seriously it's quite fun!

Unfortunately, this game has no catch-up mechanism which means that usually there's that one player who gets screwed and then can quite recover. I always feel bad for them and I should know because I've been that player in my 3rd playthrough and it was just simply not fun anymore.

Also, the die rolls!! You absolutely can NOT take this game seriously because the dice will absolutely pound you into submission! 

It's weird because I actually enjoy the game now that I understand it's just going to be a fun little take that pvp game with a lot of luck NOT to be taken seriously AT ALL. Yes I wish that the game could be more tactile and strategic but it's fun for what it is.

I still don't rank it higher than a 6 simply because it takes a while to setup, there's no real "winner" (I mean, the person who get's the last hit on the final boss wins??) And I can't help but be really annoyed at the mountain of exclusives CMON gives in their Kickstarters.

Arcadia Quest. Gameplay is fragile but fun, bloodthirsty. Lots of plastic. Nice amount of depth, tactics to the fun of running around smashing each other and punting arrows at each other. Is in the wiz wars category with no hidden information, benefit from knowing the cards etc, runs long if you play on the harder settings, but this isn't so bad as the games set up can take as long as playing does. Almost inverts my opinion - it's some set up, but as it is this game covered a few bases in my collection. I'd play it with two, but obviously better with more. 

Oh and stand alone play is fun, campaign is very good, you get the pleasure of progress without and inordinate increase in cognitive burden. 
 
Recommended and better than inferno imo.

Over the years I keep fine tuning and honing in on what I want from gaming is this represents a lot of what I'm after - And this is close to being exactly that. Tactical miniatures, light campaigning/squad developing, semi-co op and semi-competitive, fantastic production and rules that fade into the background. My one wish, would be the monsters being a bit smarter rather than just being part of the environment.

RATING: 7
Pretty fun dice-chucking festival with really stylized and detailed minis.  The tiles and tokens are colorful, as are the cards and character art.

We only played a single session, but I have a feeling that this game becomes something better when you tackle it in the campaign setting.  When I get a chance to try that, my rating is likely to go up (unless it gets ridiculously silly).  Some rules could use some tweaking, but otherwise, there's good, light fun right out of the box especially for people that like to bop their friends over the head.

===========
Update 9/21/15

This game is [i]definitely[/i] much better when you play through a campaign.  It's relatively short and won't take too much of your time, so it's not a commitment thing.  What it adds is a little progression as you will draft equipment and upgrades in between missions.  This gives players a good sense of purpose even if in the end, the ultimate victory condition is shallow - while the campaign adds the upgrades (meaning you should be going after coins each outing, so you can afford stuff), it seems a little odd that the only thing that actually counts is who wins the final mission.  Everything leading up to that will give you advantages, but are ultimately meaningless unless it means you can't possibly complete the final mission - something that only a truly terrible player will have to deal with.

Upped to a 7

The highs are high and the lows are low.  Despite my rating, and my occassionally grumpy face while playing, this is one of my favorites.  There are a lot of really raucous and inventive things you can do with the cards and character abilities - the dice just sometimes say otherwise.

A combination of poor dice rolls, sniped kills, end of mission economic disparity, poor curse draws, poor equipment drafts, and the game running too long due to the PvP bogging everything down can lead to a really frustrating experience.

I've only logged one play, but have done a lot of research into this and am confident this will settle in around a ranking of 8. I enjoyed the stand-alone play and love the art, which I think helps to set a more whimsical tone (less confrontational).

A scenario based arena fighting game with a campaign structure and lots of upgrading between missions.

It's a ton of fun and the first few scenarios play really fast. However, later scenarios use basically all of the material of the game and not only take some time to set up, but also to play. We normally play this as the first game on our game night and I set it up in advance to save some time. Setting up can take around 20 minutes, even when you know the game and have a pretty good ordering system because there are a lot of pieces and you do need most of what's in the box every time.

I wish I could get this to the table more often, but if you want to play the campaign you need to have the exact same people every time, which is difficult for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
My favorite game currently.  I love the idea that multiple guilds are competing to take on the dungeon and be the first to get the treasure.  The PvP + PvE aspects of the game are nice and very easy to customize to your playgroup.  The Campaign is good and has several branches in it that allow for multiple plays without needing to repeat missions.  The game comes with 12 characters that you make your guild of 3 from, and there are countless others available to buy separately that will add more variety to your games.

The campaign that comes with it is a bit short, but has branching paths with multiple scenarios that you can play through a few times before they become repetitive.  Luckily swapping out the characters in your team can make it feel like a new game each play through.

My kids love it and we have a blast playing together.  A must have for any family gamer and anyone who enjoys dungeon crawls.

After one session with 4 player, on one easy mission and one hard: The PVP is not for everyone, and it's easy to get some players embittered at the table because they've been picked on (left themselves exposed.  The game addresses that partially, in that there's no quest reward for subsequent kills of that player.  However, there IS gold as reward, which is more useful as it buys stuff.   

When we have to change our behaviour from "play to win" to "play so that so-and-so doesn't flip the table, even though that means you'll lose",  there's an issue (one I'm generally happy to put up with if the game is great fun).
 
I found the game-controlled mobs more interesting, generally.

Nice, colourful, pretty simple to teach.  with clear rules about line of sight and mob guard reactions and counter attacks.  A fair bit of setup.  Think I might prefer the pure co-op of, say, Gears of War for a quick blast, and team-play of SW Imperial Trooper if we're going to spend multiple sessions on the game.

First off - this is BEAUTIFUL. Big minis, colourful tiles, great rule book. One thing publisher CMON does well is mini production (which is why I bought this game). Love the chibi-style minis. But is the actual game any good? We played two scenarios. This is designed to be played as part of a campaign, so our games were relatively easy (as they're designed to be the tutorial missions of the campaign). But play was relatively fun, easy to learn & I could definitely see this being a fun campaign game if played with the right people. Enjoyed it. Will definitely play again. Would be a good game to break out with the kids.

Extremely fun competitive dungeon crawler with amazing minis (if you like chibi styled ones). It is very well balanced both with 2 and 4 players but unfortunately unplayable with 3. One scenario takes just the right amount of time for players to feel highly engaged and not get bored or feel like it is overstaying its welcome. You level up your heroes based on how good you play each scenario and you can REALLY feel each change. The neutral enemies who are controlled by your human enemy work very well. There are a lot of ways to victory which is also nice.

Really fun little game. Reminds me of maybe old final fantasy games for the older consoles. My husband REALLY enjoyed this. I think it was the combination of light game tactics, minis and scenario  based game play that drew him in. I thought maybe he would be turned off by the cute nature of the heroes and artwork, but he ended up being charmed by it. I thought this played great at 2, but I would imagine having a higher player count would only add to the fun. Cant wait to play this again!!

I love this game. It has theme and it's light enough to introduce new players easily. The campaign style makes it so there is plenty of replayability. It's neat to build up the characters with gear, and the death curses only make it that much more challenging and unique. The figures are top quality and probably my favorite to paint so far. 

My only real complaints? The figures tend to have thin connectors so I am worried they might break over time. Definitely recommend foam storage!  Lastly, their faces.. they all tend to have the same kind of RAWR mouth open expression. Lastly, this is not a good game for people that have dice hating them. Poor Scarlet died miserably with no hits to 3 hits (plus 5 crits) on my first turn in the game ever.

The bad news is that it's swingy, and that from scenario to scenario certain players can really pull ahead of the pack.

The good news is everything else. Basically, trying to turn classic RPGs into board games is a losing venture, typically shedding what's special about the two genres while adding a lot of stuff neither genre needs. Arcadia Quest solves this by unabashedly being a board game, and has more spiritually in common with Wiz-War than with Descent. I'd have a hard time going back to the latter.

Quick note: Chibis creep me out in a way that I think can be encompassed by the phrase, "five year old girl with big tits." Of which there are a few in this game. Add to this some pretty overtly Christian overtones (one of the wizards is holding a bible) and you have what amounts to a sour political aftertaste, one which I have chosen to ignore for the sake of a good time.

This is just my kind of game. RPG, modular boards and everybody against everybody. The mechanics are really interesting. I personally like how the monsters behave - at first I thought it was a drag that the monsters were "passive" agents but once you start playing it, the monster mechanic is really smart.

Miniature quality is superb. You can see all the characters details.

One small down side is that the games can be really short with two players, and the upgrade phase and setup to the next scenario takes a little while to get done. Also, my copy of the game came with almost all tiles bend, and they don't unbend too easily.

mazmorreo ligerito (mas ligerito que descent). cada jugador lleva un "gremio" de 3 personajes. gana el primero que cumpla objetivos contra el escenario y contra otros jugadores. 

reglas sencillas y cierto puteo pero con poca penalizacion y muy cachondo XD

muy divertido y aconsejable. 

como en todos los juegos de coolminiornot, las minis son de una calidad excelente. el mejor plastico a este lado del universo. es el mismo estilo chibi del SDE pero con diferentes personajes y enemigos. 

Se han jugado dos campañas. Y me he quedado un poco ahito. Aunque me beneficiara en la primera de ellas, que el ganador de la campaña sea el ganador de la ultima mision, es una cagada.

It's fast and reasonably diverting, which to be fair not all games of its ilk can boast. I worry though, that the game doesn't suit either campaign or one-off play; for the latter, you're expected to fudge things with respect to character progression, and for the former you're stuck with the same characters in perpetuity (and that seems unfun).
Exacerbating both problems if that each mode requires you to draft, and the cards aren't even balanced enough for those purposes. Heaven help you if you get stuck with weak characters in either mode, but in campaign mode you're especially screwed. The equipment is similarly all over the map, which mars both modes. And if you sanded of all the edges, and managed to limit things so that balance could be preserved, then there's practically no there there. 
As a final gripe, last-hit rewards are dumb.

Really good -light- dungeon crawler. If you love Descent, but its too hard/heavy for you or your friends, try Arcadia Quest. It has a really nice learning curve where the adding of items makes the game gradually more complex while starting really easy. Also there are always items for the cost of 0, so no one gets left behind.

Ace minis in this quick, simple, extremely fun, thematic game. 

Customisable, levelable heroes and a decent campaign included. Brilliant to play with the children. 

Hard to fault this one, more dice and monsters would be nice I suppose. But that's the price you pay for buying kickstarter games at retail these days.

My 9 yr olds face when his 7 yr old sister beat us both, and won the Moon Gate scenario, was worth the price of admission alone!!

The base game is uber fantastic. 
So it is no surprise, that I have now added:
Beyond the grave big box undead expansion
Nibbles

RATING: 9
This is an excellent game combining a zany Wiz-War-style dungeon crawl with a campaign system. Rather than simply controlling one hero, each player will control a team of three, each with different (simple) special abilities, who are drafted at the start of the game. Campaign is something of a misnomer as it is really just a series of a games with slight progression. You could even conceivably play through the whole thing in one session. In a four-player game with the base set, every character will be used. Obviously the variety afforded by expansions with new heroes and monsters is quite welcome. It's a rather expensive game, and the chibi-style figures may not appeal to everyone, but there's no doubt this is a high-quality product.

AQ is one of my wife's top 3 of all time.  Love the universe, the mechanics, and the ways that the different characters can combo off each other.  More often than not, I've found that the campaign can be won or lost in the character selection.  My wife is really good at figuring out good complementary characters by reading the cards; I tend to go for individual abilities I really like but may not synergize well. I'm usually good for winning a mission or two, but she generally owns the campaign overall (we typically play 3 or 4 player).

Ok, we haven't played this in a while because we take it a bit too personal - we've had some real temper outbursts in this game.  Great game if you can stay on the campaign which makes the sting of lost battles a little more tolerable. Playing with 3 players definitely did not work for us (2 or 4).

It takes a heck of a lot for me to part with £80 for a board game. I had something to properly celebrate on Friday and heard nothing but 'awesome' about this game and thought to give it a try, why the hell not. And that despite the fact that it really isn't our usual type of game, in fact my wife has pretty much hated anything like this in the past (tile-maps, scenarios, fantasy theme, dice chucking etc ala Super Dungeon Explore, Descent, Dungeon Twister, Wiz War...) so it was risky. She loved this game. We played three times on Saturday, fantastic time. So very very easy to learn, lots and lots of fun, plenty of variety so that it's more than a dice fest. Love it love it love it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2015)

In general Cool Mini or Not games are gorgeous and very well produced, however I have found that most of their games fell flat for me so my desire to play Arcadia Quest was very low. Most of my friends rave about the game so it was only a matter of time before they made me play it. I found the game to be better than expected, but still an ok game for me.

The rules are dead easy and the playtime varies from each scenario. 

As I wrote before, the game is GORGEOUS, the miniatures are very well done and that’s its best strength.

I love campaign games in which you level up your character and that’s the main appeal for me here, I will even play a whole a campaign to see if the game improves for me. On the other hand, I almost always dislike PvP games because they feel unfair (all against the current leader or the weakest person) and Arcadia Quest is no exception. What I liked about the game is that it isn’t all about PvP, you need to get other things done other than attack your friends and that’s why I can enjoy the game.

Some of the characters feel unbalanced BUT this doesn’t bothers me as much because you have a team of characters and the equipment can change the stats dramatically. 

The gameplay is a bit shallow and repetitive with obvious decisions most of the time. The fun comes from seeing what happens when you attack a monster or friend.

It has a high luck factor (a negative for me in a game of this length), I won the last game because I rolled lots of shields in 9 consecutive attacks (all against the leader), so I won purely by luck. If a player fails to kill a target but leave him wounded all other players will try to attack that target (the weakest player). The equipment can change this point but I feel tactics take a second seat behind luck on Arcadia Quest.

Bottom line, Arcadia Quest is an ok game for me. I will play if requested but with some reluctance. I won’t buy it. It is a great game for many of my friends but not my kind of game.

Backed on Kickstarter and went all-in. The miniatures look amazing, and the Guildmaster box is really helpful for keeping track of everything. The game is different from the average dungeon crawl with the PvP element that is built in. Some of the heroes are definitely stronger than others, but we usually deal 4-6 and keep 3.

First play impressions: it seems like  a hybrid between Wizwar and a more tactical combat game. Not sure if it's not doing it really well, or if I'm not the target audience for that sort of game (I love Wizwar, and like Memoir).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I like this more than I had expected to. It is a very streamlined tactical combat game with leveling and a campaign system. It isn't breaking new ground by any means. However, it is a unique mix of mechanics and they are woven together very well. The rules are clear and there are just enough of them to hold the game together, there is no bloat here.

[b]What I liked:[/b]
-Elegant rules and clear goals
-Quick playtime that doesn't get bogged down
-Fun combos
-PvP combat is often not in your best interest, and players are incentivized to spread their attacks around.
-Exploding 6's mean that there is always a chance you can get off the attack you want, or the defense you need. This adds a lot of dramatic moments.

[b]What I disliked:[/b]
-Random! The dice, of course, but it's not limited to that, I actually think they handled the dice well. It's more the multi-player chaos. For example, when a wounded character is ripe for the picking. Since killing them is one third of the points needed to win this can be a huge boon to the person who is next in turn order after the character is injured.

-You often have little you can do on a turn. Goals are not easy to accomplish, and attempting one will often leave it easier for the next player to accomplish. Additionally, leaving yourself in a vulnerable position is very bad. This means you are likely to have a few turns where you accomplished very little. Or possibly a few where you helped others more than yourself.

-Some of the equipment cards are terrible. A card has to at least earn it's slot, with only 4 slots per character each card must be good enough to justify its place and there are a handful of cheap equipment cards that cannot do this. Sure they cost almost no coins, but they consume 1 slot which is an incredibly valuable resource so they need to be better.

-Keeping the same characters for the entire campaign is boring. Swapping one out after each game would be nice. There are a lot of characters, and campaigns are long (~10 hours), so seeing more characters would have been welcome.

-The tactical/strategic thinking in the game is hampered considerably by the random elements.

-The game is a race to 3 points, obtaining the third point ends the round immediately and there is no compensation for going last. The earlier you are in turn order the better off you are, it is blatantly obvious and the game does nothing to deal with this. Results are not extremely lopsided only because the random elements help to washout this bias. 

-Being the first one to attack a big baddie is often bad. You don't have a good chance to kill them and you simply set them up for someone else. This can create really awkward situations where nobody wants to act first.

-Winning the campaign is oddly ambiguous. Perhaps an attempt to keep all the players engaged in the outcome. 

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]
I can see the appeal, especially if you like direct player conflict in your games. The quick playtime is nice and takes the edge off of the random elements. There is a high fun factor if you play with the right group. It's probably the best game I've ever played in the genre, but with a few major drawbacks for me. I think a rework of the game as a coop would appeal to me more.

My new favorite. Does not take as long as descent or Shadows of Brimstone, and has a quick arcade/dungeon crawl/not sure what it is feel to it.
 
Fun to play for my 6 and 13 yr old children.
They get to attack other heroes but at least a PVE quest as well.
Can pull it out on a whim if I have 45-90 minutes to spare, although, it should go much quicker if players are 8 and older.
Not too may things to keep track of, that you may forget if you have not played it for a while.
Too complex for my 4 year old which I cannot get to sit still yet ;-) Seeing that the suggested age is 14+ this is a given :-)

Only reason I do not give it 10 is because the player cards tend to slide around on the player dashboard since it's slippery glossy cardboard.

The game is a fun dice chucker. The first game feels quite random and some characters feel underpowered because there is not many equipments on the heroes and you don't have the items that give rerolls but I am told they balance the future games quite well. I liked the idea of bursting dice (although I saw the system also on Armello but don't know which came first). I quite liked it and want to get it if the reprint happens.

This is one of those games that every time I go in my game closet I wonder why I'm not playing it more. It's a really fun PvP game without having too much direct conflict. I think the reason that I don't play it more is that I feel like I have to play it as a campaign and I rarely get the opportunity to do that.

Ez  a játék szenzációs. Egyszerre küzdesz a játék adta küldetésekért, és a többi játékos ellen. Folyamatos a játékosok közötti interakció tekintettel a maponként min. 1 alkalommal teljesítendő pvp questre (minden mapon min. 1 ellenséges hero-t le kell vadászni), de maga a játék is folyamatosan alakul és alakítja az esetleges konfliktusokat is. És ha még a chibi hero-kat is kedveled, akkor ez a neked való játék. A 100+ hero komoly újrajátszási lehetőséget ad, mivel egy guild 3 hero-ból áll. Megunhatatlan kedvenc lesz :)

Por hacer una comparación, es como un Zombicide en el que tienes que cumplir una serie de misiones, pero al mismo tiempo luchas con los demás jugadores (no es colaborativo). Le da un enfoque diferente que no puedo decir que me guste más o menos, sin haber jugado más campañas.

Me gustó, había pique entre los jugadores y matanza de bichos a partes iguales. Las miniaturas muy chulas (¿o debería decir 'cool's?).

Let's just put it this way: I have played through an entire campaign in about 9 days. This game is great. It is quirky, silly, bash-everyone's-head-in fun. Get it. Play it. Kill each other and have fun. 

It can sometimes be swingy with the dice, resulting in some frustrating moments. But the exploding dice mechanic always keeps you in the hunt. 

My wife and I have mainly played this as a two player game. We have modified it so that we have to still complete three objectives instead of two because the games were ending too soon.

Edited 9/19/2016: I am cooling on this one a bit. This game can be really frustrating at the two-player count. If one person rolls badly a few times, the other has a clear road to domination.

This game is amazing. It brings me back to my childhood memories, with countless hours spent playing HeroQuest. This game has a similar feel, but without a dungeon master. Plus, it has a much lighter, whimsical feel that they pulled off perfectly. It has tons of replay-ability, with so much potential for customization. Definitely a keeper for my most-used shelf.

Arcadia Quest is a campaign-based game for 2 to 4 players, where each player controls a guild of three unique heroes, facing off against the other players and the various monsters controlled by the game. Players need to accomplish a series of quests in order to win each scenario and choose where to go next in the campaign.

Players are able to choose the path their campaign takes, navigating through six out of eleven available scenarios, so each time the campaign is played it can have a different configuration of scenarios. As the campaign progresses, the heroes are able to acquire new weapons, equipment and abilities that give them powerful options to tackle the obstacles ahead. Furthermore, by fulfilling specific quests in a scenario, players unlock exclusive features in subsequent scenarios.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a very short, simplistic, but competitive dungeon crawl where the first to reach three goals wins/ends the scenario. This can lead to the rich becoming richer if everyone else doesn't gang up on the leader in the campaign. There is a draft of characters to begin a campaign and I'd recommend a practice game to get a feel for how the game works before jumping into a campaign. There is a fair bit of PvP in the game.

RATING: 9
Me and my kids really enjoy this game.  We have played it multiple times and love all the miniatures that come with the game.  it is especially gratifying to level up and draw new weapons after each level.  one drawback, which might be a strength to others is it is not cooperative.  We tend to gravitate to games where we are working together instead of on your own...

This is probably one of the games I am most grateful that I got in on the Kickstarter for. While I am not a fan of Kickstarter's that have a lot of promotional items just in the Kickstarter, I am also glad that I was part of this one. The extra heroes really kick this game up a notch. 

Arcadia Quest isn't a thinking game by any means, but you will find yourself thinking about strategy to use on your turn. It's not a complex game, but there are a number of moving parts that you must keep in mind on your turn. This isn't a terribly thematic game, but you will find yourself imagining the action on the board in a theatrical way. AQ really strikes a balance for having so many moving parts. The components are really top notch, and in usual Cool Mini or Not fashion the miniatures are something to behold. I really did wish I knew how to paint. I may even pay someone to paint them for me that's how awesome they are. The graphic design and other components are all really well done and are top notch as well. The campaign system is dropped dead brilliant, along with the upgraded equipment after each mission. Take a dash of [gameid=39463], add a pinch of [gameid=2163], mix in a healthy dose of [gameid=699], and lay on top a good amount of [gameid=69120] and you will basically get Arcadia Quest. All of these games provide the players with an awesome experience as a game, and believe me when I tell you that Arcadia Quest will give you just as an awesome experience when you play it. I'm pretty sure after completing a few campaigns my rating for this will go up.

It's fun but this definitely comes from the campaign. Most of the fun comes from customising your clan inbetween scenarios and testing out your new stuff in the next one.
If it were just single missions without guildprogress I would rate it a 6.
Biggest downside of the game is it's dicedependence, winners are often chosen just by luck.
It's just no more fun and very frustrating, when you can't defend a single hit with 15 rolls, while an opponent scores 5 defends with just 3 dice.

Amazingly fun battle royale game. More depth than i expected with the different hero combinations and different items. I think it wouldnt have been as pleasurable without the guildmaster heroes as it gives you so much more of a hero selection than the base set. Amazingly beautiful miniatures pretty much justify the cost of this game, and its also a really fun pvp oriented game. If you do not like direct conflict then this game is not for you, as the objectives force you to kill at least one other player as an objective. My one gripe with this game is the long set ups involved with each scenario. I'm going to have to figure out how to set my box up so its more efficient for set up

RATING: 7
Awesome:  Quality and detail of miniatures is amazing!  I can't wait to get these painted.
Good:  Gameplay provides good choices in playstyle, equipment and strategy.
Bad:  Watch out for pvp temper flares! (if that's an issue in your group).  High price of expanded set heroes.  We use all powers, but don't get the minis.
Ugly:  Hero powers are unbalanced.  Wisp can singlehandedly win many scenarios because he avoids masses of baddies while others must slog through.  Unbalance is the main reason this is not rated higher.  We overcame this by printing out cards from the CMON website and using powers from minis that we don't own.  So that others can use Wisp's power without using that character.  

Overall:  Our family had a great time playing this game!  We completed two full campaigns and had fun each scenario.  Some scenarios had tense back and forth action trying to get objectives and tension waiting for that exploding critical role.  We will definitely complete more campaigns and make our own scenarios.  
Having said that, the team with Wisp won 80% of our scenarios... He can breeze through and get to objectives while other teams are still wading through goblins and orcs to get there.  If I buy a game at these prices, I don't want to have to work to get it balanced.  
I will get in on the next Kickstarter so as to avoid skyrocketing prices for the exclusives.  Graciously, CMON has allowed the use of the power card graphics, so we can use the powers without going broke.

-Quick campaign: Normally, campaigns can be hard to keep going, if something comes up in real life.  Since this is only 6 missions, it's pretty easy to cram into a short time period, if necessary.  Plus, it leaves you wanting to play more after its over instead of thinking it's finally done.
-Simple rules: Although, when/how monsters attack too a little bit to wrap my head around.  Felt like I spent a little too much time with that instead of the actual tactics of the game in the beginning, but it gets better with experience.

Purchased at Target 11/24/15.  

Ridiculously fun game.  Really shines at 4 players.  Lot of diabolical revenge moments.  However, these are very tongue-in-cheek and all in good fun - this isn't a malicious game.  The game is light enough to teach to even new gamers, and is exciting enough even for those who like heavier games.

Action can be tense, and dying isn't the end of the world.  There isn't as much of a risk of runaway leader here.  Great game overall.

Not much player interaction at 2-player (at least in the first few missions).  Probably due to the lack of "kill _color_" card.  Might try playing 2-player with multiplayer rules.

---
Update 3/10/16.  Rating dropped from 9.5 to 8.  Not a big drop, but it has lost some points due to setup time.  It's hard to get out to play.  After playing 4p, I'm not sure we want to make a real effort to play 2p.  It's so much more tense and fun at 4p!!

---
Update 4/12/16.  Finally made good headway through the 2p campaign.  The escalation and sense of building characters is amazing.  The narrative is somewhat there, but not on the level of Heirs of Blood.  Still a great game at 2p, with lots of WOW moments.    But in the end, it is... a dice game.

Awesome campaign skirmishing game, especially 4 player. Gorgeous components, particularly the minis. Has plenty of direct conflict between players, plus player-vs-environment missions. Mission system avoids king making and balances the scenarios in a neat way. Uses burst dice, which means plenty of luck involved, but mitigated throughout the campaign with item cards and character abilities.

Arena combat, multi-scenario campaign, persistent loot and powers, and buckets of dice.

Not to be taken at all seriously, and tons of fun as long as you don't.

Good:
There are a lot of tense moments when you are trying to roll a hit or defense as well as a lot of strategy in drafting characters, equipment, and deciding how you will accomplish the objectives while hindering your foes from completing them. For me this balance of luck and strategy is what makes the game extremely re-playable. 

The rules aren't too complex and the games end up with a lot of humorous bolstering, there are post game tales about the backstabbing/lucky kills, and there is a pretty good sense of satisfaction when you are able to pull off a win.

The high-quality components is icing on the cake, which makes this a game I would recommend to folks interested in competitive dungeon crawl style games. 

Bad:
It takes a while to set up a scenario. One game took longer to set everything up than it did for the game to finish. It does become quicker the more you play though.

I prefer playing this game as a campaign for building a group up instead of by one-off scenario. This makes it less likely to be played when not in a consistent game group. 

There are a lot of extras for this game and if you end up enjoying the game you will likely want them all. Unfortunately, many extras were kickstarter exclusives so are way over priced.

Characters are unbalanced, so you need to know this when going into a draft and be familiar with a variety of characters. This means new players can select an underdog team if you allow them to. When teaching the game I usually don't partake in the draft and provide insight on character's strengths and weaknesses.

Uno de los juegos de miniaturas player vs player más divertidos y con momentos más épicos (frente a otros igualmente lastimosos) del panorama lúdico. La mecánica de las explosiones de dados hace que ningún combate esté asegurado, y la progresión en campaña le aporta un mayor peso mientras tratas de optimiazar los múltiples combos existentes entre los héroes de tu guild y su equipo. Detalle negativo es la propensión del modo campaña a generar una bola de nieve en la que un jugador se convierte en imbatible mientras otro se ve condenado a morir una y otra vez, siendo además penalizado por ello.

I was first enamored by the miniatures and the quantity of content. Gameplay was very dynamic with lots of interaction, take-that battles and hilarity. It dropped a peg in my list since starting the campaign mode, as I slipped behind the pack in terms of power level and I realized there are no catch up mechanisms. I don't mind losing a few games, but I probably can't ever get back into competition. There is a strong positive feedback loop of gold begetting better items begetting even more gold.

NOTE: This is for a retail copy of the game without any of the Kickstarter exclusives.

Arcadia Quest is so much fun! The rulebook looks big and intimidating, but its mostly pictures and fluff, so the game is fun to play and easy to teach. Arcadia Quest is a great entry-point into getting other players together for a campaign-style game. However, unlike many other campaign games like Descent or Imperial Assault that are all-against-one or fully cooperative, this game is purely player-vs-player, and even has PVP specific quests to accomplish in order to win the game. When teaching the game to new players, it is very important to reiterate this point with them so no one feels "betrayed" because someone stole their kill or even killed them. 

The game can be quite random as all attacks are dependent on dice rolls, but the game is typically quick enough that it doesn't bother me. I can, however, understand that it isn't for everyone because of the luck aspect associated with these dice rolls. Often times, players may get screwed because someone else was able to land the final blow on a monster that you have been scratching away at, or your heavily-geared hero may be killed by another players scrub because of some lucky dice rolls. That stuff doesn't bother me much, and the ridiculousness of the game propels this game towards the top of my list of my favorite games.

Excelente juego para compartir junto a los amigos, recomendado si te gustan los juegos de aventuras, exploración y búsqueda.
Las partidas varían dependiendo de la confabulación entre las alianzas con la finalidad de conseguir un mejor equipamiento para la siguiente partida y la individualidad gobernada para equiparar toda la fama y gloria para su propio beneficio.
Difícil de explicar al inicio, pero luego de un par de turnos, los participantes novatos le toman gusto al juego, esto es debido a que les llama la atención los personajes y la posibilidad de decidir todas las acciones según su conveniencia.
Ve mesa casi siempre, esto es por el tiempo de juego, armado y desarmado del tablero.

Auf den ersten Blick könnte man meinen, Arcadia Quest in ein weiterer Dungeoncrawler in der Tradition von Descent und Co. Weit gefehlt, denn tatsächlich hat Arcadia Quest mit seinem Spielprinzip sogar ein Alleinstellungsmerkmal. Es handelt sich nämlich um einen, zu 100% konfrontativen und kompetitiven Crawler. Es gibt keinen Overlord, die Monster agieren völlig automatisch. Jeder Spieler steuert die Geschicke seiner eigenen kleinen Heldengruppe, auf der Suche nach Ruhm, Ehre und vor allem Loot. Da kann es auch passieren, dass man den Helden eines Mitspielers über den sprichwörtlichen Jordan schickt. Mit seiner Anime/Manga Chibi-Optik und seinen hübschen Miniaturen ist Arcadia Quest ein echter Eyecatcher und ein total witziges und spannendes Spiel.

Arcadia es uno de mis dungeon crawlers favoritos, y lo es por lo simple que es. Muchas veces es muy dificil conseguir que todos en la mesa quieran jugar un Descent o un Temple of Elemental Evil, pero Arcadia, no terminas de decir su nombre y ya todos aceptaron! :D 
El tema aquí es que las reglas son simples, la forma como los jugadores van haciendo crecer a sus personas lo es igual, y sientes como tu personaje se va volviendo más poderoso a punta de ítems. La temática es de las más lindas que hay, ese diseño chibi japonés, hace que todo se sienta tan ligero, pero al momento de jugar! a ver si te escapas de que los demás jugadores no te quieran cortar en pedacitos! 
Un excelente juego! Porque no un 9 o un 10, porque finalmente es muy simple y eso hace que los personajes no se sientan tan personalizables, sientes que tienes los mejores items, pero todos los podrían tener, así que ese detalle es el que me lleva al 8.

Very appealing art and miniatures, but ultimately a very ho-hum skirmish game.

I honestly don't get the hype...

My favourite board game I own. Really sad that I had to buy the game post KS, but do not regret at all.

From the simple rules, down to how everything interacts in the game, upgrading your character, lots of options, plenty of weapons. This game has everything. Has the problem of long set up/tear down, though, I can easily look past it due to how broad the game is.

I bought it after looking at a review giving high praise. Can easily convince others to try it at least, but the game can stand on its own merits - and is the sole reason I am starting to paint minis, however, not starting on this game but others to practise on.

I came into this game with mild expectations as we do not play a lot of highly combative games, but this being an Eric Lang game from CMON, I needed to try it.  This paid off great as we enjoyed the game a lot and found the combat to not feel like a big deal.  Great sleeper hit for us.

PvP+PvE dungeon battler with outstanding minis, great quality for the other components, and fairly straightforward rules. Looks like this is a hit with us so far, but needs a few more plays to see if it will lose its luster. We aren't typically into cutthroat PvP-type games, but I think this one works well for us because dying isn't that big a deal - it's not totally without consequence, but since you're playing three heroes and you can resurrect all dead heroes by resting, you're never really out of the game.

Very enjoyable dungeon crawl game. I love the anime artwork, and miniatures are all very nice. The gameplay is simple, but I actually rather like that since the speed and randomness are acceptable levels. The bursts on attacks are really cool, and I like how streamlined it is, especially compared to, say, DnD which is a bit more convoluted.

Plays: 10+

EDIT: After many more plays, I find myself not enjoying or wanting to play as much. I had two sessions semi recently, one with M and P and another session with T and IM that I found a bit more lacking. M commented how swingy it was when she won, and T said the same thing (and T was behind in the beginning). I did always notice this, but it hurts a bit more when my friends point it out. I also find myself less inclined toward Ameritrash, especially when I analyze myself as a gamer and consider my changing feelings toward games. Two of my friends, L and E, have a campaign with me and they ordered Inferno, so I'll probably still keep this for now and maybe test it out with their Inferno set/finish our campaign, and I have another campaign that S and P expressed interest in. IM also expressed sadness/surprise when I mentioned maybe selling it, so I may just keep it for the few friends who enjoy it. But overall, not wanting to play, with the dice rolls (albeit a bit can be mitigated and its meant to be lighthearted fun) being a bit swingy and especially loooong setup time. I'd prefer other euro ish games with fast play and more thinky (as that's the kind of gamer I am).

The miniatures are amazing! They are so big and detailed. It's a light dungeon crawler. Not for family because there are a bit too much rules but it's a nice gateway to more complex games. I like the progression of the heroes. The more the campaign goes on, the more you are attached to your heroes (sometimes they live woes and it's very funny). It's a good idea to always control three heroes because you can combine their abilities to help you in your mission. You roll a lot of dice and it's sometimes dramatic when you think you are strong and you finally loose the fight. The artwork is very attractive and humorous. I highly recommend to take a look at it!

I like this game but there are some problems for me:

1. Set up is a BEAR!!!! Can take 15 minutes to set up and then re-check whether anything was missed (I regularly miss a token or monster somewhere on the board).

2. The board is a bit busy. While I appreciate the art, things can easily get lost or can be difficult to focus on. 

3. Rules are fairly easy and very thematic. But thematic rules also mean rules that are easy to miss, forget or misinterpret.

4. Typical for Eric Lang, there is a tendency for balance issues (ganging up, king making, runaway leader, logical elimination, etc.). Eric Lang's way of increasing interaction is to create situations that require players to constantly be vigilant for these balance issues and focus attention on preventing it. If you don't then there will be major balance issues. I find this type of game design can limit the decision space, and make some of the games in the campaign frustrating when one player clearly has much stronger characters.

Fundamentally, it's a Player vs Player skirmish tactic game. Only the player doing the "coup de grace" gets the point and there are plenty of teleporters: everybody will be targeting the most wounded players. The modular board doesn't use to be big, you will be able to attack almost any target in a given turn.

That means the game has a very important random component: if the previous player misses several targets leaving them wounded, you will be on your way to victory. The strategic component is almost non-existant and tactic component is very light: you just need to recognize targets of oportunity when available and take them, and trying to make the most of your abilities and items.

The gameflow is quite good, the games are very short and this is very positive for a game that light-hearted. It's been designed to be played as a campaign mode, and while there's also secnarios that can be played separately, I strongly disagree with one rule: these scenarios require the players to complete 3 goals, and the game stops as soon as one player does so, and awards him with 5 extra points; completing these goals can take 5-6 turns, that means in a given round, several players are likely to complete the feat, but only the firs of them will collect the 5 points (usually, you get around 8-11 points). That concedes a huge advantage to the first players, making them much more likely to win and making it impossible for the last player. I usually don't comment rules here, but I found this issue so serious that I felt I should do it.

There are quite a few minis, Chibi style, and the quality of the components and the art is very good. I would say the price, €90, is quite high even for its quality, moreover for a game that light.

A bit too chaotic to be my favorite game, but this is a very fun family game with lots of attacking and backstabbing. Lots of downtime between turns with my family.

Our youngest son (age 7) won our first campaign by utilizing a perfect Wisp strategy. We thought he was crazy right up until he took Fang out with a HUGE roll. Any medium weight game where our youngest can win legitimately (and have fun doing it) is good stuff. Just slightly too much downtime to hold his attention completely though.

This game has everything, dice, tons of minis, new gear, a campaign that's somewhat different every time. So what's not to like? Well, the game is rather simple. You run around whacking monsters and trying to complete a quest. Combat is just chucking dice to see if you hit and them rolling defense dice to cancel your hits. It's also a touch fiddly with the rules as there are a lot of them for such a simple game. Not to mention items only add more rules which are sometimes vague or unclear in spots.

Kind of mindless fun, the campaign is a nice feature, but I worry that the rich get richer in it. Still, it's an enjoyable game. Maybe upon completion of the campaign, my rating will rise, but it's currently at a 6.

Note: I'm really surprised they didn't offer a co-op variation on the game. It doesn't seem like it would be that hard to implement. You have to already complete 1 PVE event to win a scenario and there are 2 that are always available. Just adding more difficult or complex ones to complete and maybe buffing certain monsters would have made this something that went from good to great. The PVP aspect is fun, but it gets a bit repetitive.

Increíble juego donde ganar la partida no es lo importante, sino salir ganando.

A FANTASTIC little dungeon crawl style game with excellent artwork and fantastic miniatures.  I just adore this game. It'a a campaign style game where each scenario, you find yourself improving upon your guild of three characters.  Each scenario ends when a certain number of quests are completed.  These quests could involve killing monsters or yes... taking out one of your opponents characters.  The coins you receive for such you use to be weapons and upgrades.  Monsters move in response to attacks and characters coming into proximity of them so no GM needed. Quick playtime (~60 minutes) is another plus.

My favourite game to play with the family (me, wife, 8-year old son and 10-year old daughter), and I think it's their favourite game to play too. My son isn't always keen to play games and gets distracted easily when he does, but Arcadia Quest always keeps his attention and he'll usually want to play again as soon as a scenario is finished. 

It's not a deep game, it's not supposed to be. It's just pure fun. But there's still enough strategy to make it satisfying; enough luck to ensure that anyone can win. 

The campaign is a fantastic experience. Getting better loot to build up your characters is just so enjoyable, and everyone develops a strong connection with the members of their team. We hate having to say goodbye to them at the end of a campaign and pick a new bunch for the next one. But at the same time we also can't wait to draft characters again, with fresh, exciting ideas of who to put together to comprise our next party.

Every now and then, when we have to cooperate to bring down a big enemy in a PvE quest, I get a flashback to old-school World of Warcraft raids. None of the complexity, but all the thrill. It's a special board game that can come close to capturing that feeling, even for a moment.

Arcadia Quest is a competitive game, but it's easy to tone down the competitive aspect if you choose to, which makes it ideal for playing with children. You can focus on PvE quests and even give them a hand when necessary in completing their own quests. Then you can regret your benevolence when they mercilessly stab you in the back to complete their final PvP quest and win the game. Oh yes, I've been there.

I wanted to try a different genre, and as Dieter heard some good things about this game, I bought myself a copy. I took some time before I got my copy as the base game seemed not available in Europe for some months.

Played 1 scenario yesterday. Everything was quite straightforward, so turns were very quick and it only took us 40 minutes to complete the scenario. I don't think it will become my favourite genre, therefore the PvP is a bit too high. But off course to fully enjoy this game, you have to play a campaign and Wim and Wouter decided we will play one in the upcoming weeks.

First and foremost, I was under the impression that I was certainly paying for eye-candy with this game.  The miniatures were astounding, the tiles were beautiful and the components were well constructed.  I did not expect the game itself to be as good as it is.  Our group has logged in about a dozen games and have had a blast each and every time.  The only real negative that has occurred is due to our gaming group personality.  Half of us enjoy competition while the other half of us prefer cooperative play.  I love the competitive play.

I thought this game wouldn't bring down my super dungeon explore bubble, but it did. I thought the PvP as a great mix as you are not set on fighting only the monsters on the board. Letting your opponents knock off some of their health (or the monster) and then stealing the kills are a nasty way to get on top.

HeroQuest for the 21st century which yielded an enjoyable session, though perhaps not for all at the table. The game is good mechanically, but there were PVP issues as two players in the second Scenario beat down the player who had won the first scenario and consequently achieved nothing at all. I had a disastrous first Scenario ('tank' dead first dice roll, ended on 3 Gold) but stayed out of trouble in Scenario 2 to get the 'win’. Also, one player opened the door - literally - for the next player to make easy gains… twice! What can you do?

This is a fun all vs all dungeon crawler game where each player has their own party of three characters. You play a sequence of 6 levels. Each level has a number of quests up, both quests that involve doing something special on the map, and quests that reward you for killing other player's characters. The first to three quest completed is the winner. After each level, players get the opportunity to spend the dollars they gained to buy new equipment which is drafted. I was worried going into this game that the player vs player element would feel too harsh, or that the curses you get after having a character would die would feel too punitive, but that hasn't been the case. In truth both these elements serve to balance the game, and add more strategy in terms of your action choices and targets. I love how in this game, the player to your right controls the monsters during your turn. It turns what could have been an ill-thought out AI into an invested party making the best choices for them, but not for you.

Pretty good overall, but really needs to be played as a campaign with a consistent group to make it fun. The combat system is good, but doesn't feel like enough by itself. I'm not a huge fan of the PVE / PVP mix, which can make the game feel chaotic and swingy. The campaign mode gives longevity and weight to decisions and outcomes in the game, and seems like it would be better. The game also seems to run a bit long and takes a while to set up and tear down.

I think that this game is a little funky, and I'm willing to give it another shot, because I think it could be fun with a few friends as a regular thing. But the cost of it, the problems with the mechanics (which aren't so severe), and the fact that I'm still pretty miffed at Cool Minis or Not for their general existence, and it's overall a rather passable experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
One-off missions are great - fun, quick, satisfies the dungeon-crawl/monster hunt itch.  Games can end up one-sided, but no big deal with one-off.

The one-sidedness is what causes the lower rating of the game.  If you play the campaign, there are potential game-breaking combos that can make it so one-sided that another player doesn't stand a chance, and the missions become less and less fun.

Would play a one-off game for sure, but I am done with the campaign.  Problem is, I prefer campaigns in games, and it was the entire reason I purchased this game.

Very fast-paced skirmish miniature game. I really enjoy that Arcadia quest has quite simple rules and during your turn you only move and attack. I do not like when Ameritrash gets to convoluted and complicated, and at the end the die rolls anyhow decide everything. 

Single scenarios take only little time and during a campaign you can upgrade your heroes' equipment. The heros all have just one special ability and different defense stats, but this is sufficient that they feel different. The drigger mechanism of monsters is simple and works really well. However, I suspect that the prices of the items you may buy are not well balanced.

Of course the miniatures are very nice and I enjoy the cartoonic fantasy setting a lot. I think this game could really be a hit with families, as the basic rules are straightforward and gameplay is swift.

Beautiful art and components! Game is out of balance when a player faces a scenario and rolls very bad and gets no coins to upgrade, while your opponent(s) have a lot of coin. Then you are doomed to loose the campain. Even after 1 scenario it's clear you will loose the campaign. VERY UNBALANCED!

It is great fun to chase and dodge your opponents.

Rating after one full campaign.   Played core campaign plus both Beyond the Grave heroes.
Pros
- Amazing balance between quests for player versus the game scenarios, and player vs player.
- Miniatures are outstanding.  Even if you do not like chili style you will after this.
- Scenarios are well balanced for starting points for all players
- Hero abilities are good, but key in game is ability to level up with items and weapons as game goes along. Gives it enough of the RPG feel.
Cons
-Extremely fidgety and labor intensive to take down and set up new campaigns.
- Some players can take advantage of blocking, and spawning rules if they wanted to really harass someone
- Core game has plenty to keep you entertained for 15-20 hours, but you'll want more heroes to sprinkle in.

Overall this game fit perfectly my group of friends that tried it.  While we were tentative to attack each other at first, the gloves came off quickly.  If you like games where you main mission is to tackle the scenario, but you can help or hurt each other along the way this is a near must.    I was also surprised how much the leveling up of items and weapons really changed things up and everyone took a different strategy.  Yet it felt it stayed balance throughout and no-one got left in the dust.

As for the setup and take down I can only suggest buying or making a better insert. I used Go7Gaming premade Arcadia Quest insert and it is fantastic. Cut the set up time in half, and made organization so so much better from boards, figures, tokens, and cards.

Hugely disappointed with this game. I saw it at Origins 2017 and had heard a lot about Masmorra. I saw this one being played and was enamored by the fact that it had a campaign mode. After playing a few battles of campaign mode I was utterly underwhelmed. For what I expected and then what I played, it was crap. As a fan of games like Descent 1st edition and Gloomhaven, this doesn't even come close. Campaign mode in this game is a joke. You carry over a couple of items....LAME!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Positives: 
Components
Well Designed Scenarios (the kill quests on some are a bit too hard imo though)
The combat system is just fun... you always have a shot and crits make the rolls extremely exciting
Getting new gear is fun
The PvE rewards are really fun. Special gear or titles are both great.

Negatives: 
Rules (Bombs and timing on certain things are unclear)
Item costs seem wrong (grrr at 7 gold)
Rare/Best items may go to same person in drafting
Gold is too easy to get and mostly meaningless
Piggypack on villians doesn't feel great. If you can't one shot a villian, it's typically not wise to attack them and that causes odd situations. To make matters worse, the final quest is to kill a boss who has tons of health.

Backed on Kickstarter.

Wow, this game is so much fun. There's always something to do. Even when it's not your turn you're either rolling dice for the monsters (or your own hero's defense) and cheering when your rivals bash each other's heads in with a [i]Skullcracker[/i]. Turns move very quickly, and choices are often very clear.

I haven't played a full campaign yet, but what I've seen of the upgrading-gear-to-make-your-team-more-efficient-part of the game, is very good.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] No and I don't think I will, as I fear it will devaluate the Kicstarter extra's a bit - if I'd ever want to sell them.

We quickly fell in love with this game from the moment it hit the table. Super fun and light dungeon crawl with incredibly cute and well done miniatures that satisfies the craving of a quest based adventure where you level up your heroes. It is so fun that you don't even mind who wins, you just want to buy some new equipment and set out on the next scenario. One of our favorites.
Highly recommended for 2+ players.

Adquirí este juego buscando diversión pura en una duración contenida y con una producción excelente.

Arcadia Quest cumple con todo ello, quizá a excepción de la duración, que si añadimos la preparación del escenario, puede irse rápidamente a las 2 horas o más de partida.

El modo campaña y la posibilidad de "salvar" la partida, es un gran acierto por la satisfacción de ver evolucionar al grupo de héroes.

No me gusta la preparación del escenario, bastante tediosa, y que la finalización de la partida puede ser un poco abrupta.

Por lo demás, un juego que cumple lo que promete, con el que no tendremos que devanarnos mucho los sesos, y simplemente nos divertiremos tirando dados, disfrutando de las miniaturas y atacando a los rivales.

Fantasy miniatures skirmish game with a branching campaign.

Pro: Beautiful components - extremely high quality. Replay value is great. Easy to teach/play. Campaign mode works VERY well - stage-specific upgrading mechanism. Nice variety in missions and quests.

Con: Number of components may be overwhelming at first. Board tiles are hideous. Playtime can drag if players don't have a mutual-agreement to streamline everything.

Love this RPG Game. We bought this to introduce our daughter to D&D "style" gaming.  This was great for her as there is really no "death" in the game. The mechanics of the game are simple and allows for fast playing; however, a game can take a long time especially if the minions keep respawning. We have played a whole campaign with our daughter and she kicked our butts.

My wife and I played through the campaign and had a blast. The scenarios are fun, and with multiple ways to win each scenario, strategy is important as well. And when you're done with each scenario, buying your gear and improving your characters is a blast too. On top of it all, AMAZING minis and probably the best overall component quality I've ever seen in a board game. If a fun, light-hearted, fantasy campaign game sounds good to you, you can't go wrong with this one.

I very much like the game overall, but the mere existence the excessive amount of Kickstarter exclusives that I'll never be able to get has a seriously negative impact on my level of enjoyment.
Separate ratings would look like this:
game: 8/10
business model: 1/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.2
The miniatures look great, the gameplay is nice, but not that special. The fact that half the game was only available to Kickstarter Backers as an excessive amount of Kickstarter Exclusives might have additionally affected my rating.
(I'm a completionist, who sadly likes to support his local game store instead of paying one year in advance for a game made by a company that financially doesn't need such advance payments to create their games and tries to blackmail their customers into still doing exactly that by making half the game kickstarter exclusive.)
To remain on topic though: I find the variety to be severely lacking. Three heroes appear to be stronger than the rest and their 'counters' are Kickstarter exclusive. You can't even play without them because the retail version comes exactly with the minimum number of heroes needed for a four player game. More monsters wouldn't hurt either, but aren't in the retail box.
A rating for the complete game would probably be higher and possibly move the game into the 7.x region for me.

Finally got a chance to play arcadia quest this weekend. At first, I really thought that the game was going to be just ok. But then we started playing the game and I HIGHLY enjoyed the game. We watched the "watch it play" video before playing and then went straight into a game (after setting up, of course). I dominated the first game and I feel as though I got some really good equipment out of the first round. Im excited to play more, and Ill most likely paint my minis (though my never turn out well).

Rating af first play: Hmm... I kinda felt a bit disappointed. Thought there would be more too it, but it's almost too simple. 

There was definitely a lack of meaningful descisions and good dice roles seemed too be almost the only thing that mattered. Also, there was not much variety in the monsters and the dungeon seemed almost lifeless, because the monsters only reacted when you attacked them or moved passed them... 

Removed from my wishlist for the time being. Need to play some more before deciding if I want it in my collection or not.

Maybe it's just too ameritrash?

RATING: 8
This is exactly the category of game I love most. RPG-lite with dice and item cards and plastic minis. This plays quickly and easily and the campaign rules are really great. I like how you can come up with interesting ability/item combos and stuff.

The only down side I guess is that it's not that great 2 player and it's pretty long to setup for how long each scenario is. Also the endings can seem pretty abrupt/anti-climactic in each scenario.

This game is amazing.  My boys (9 and 7) are loving it and constantly ask to play it.  They are loving the new equipment they get every time they play and the crazy stories that come out of every scenario.  I love the crazy luck-fest that is combat.  My game group loves that they can stab each other in the back and feel like they're accomplishing something.  This game fits so many types of gamers.  I can't think of anything wrong with it except for the luck factor.  If you don't like games with a lot of luck, stay away.  Amazing game.

So fun. It can be a bit repetitive after a long day of playing a campaign and the missions don't feel all that thematic, but the progression through the game of building up your characters' weapons and armor and trying to create synergy between upgrades is so so so fun. Rules are a bit fiddly when you are learning, but when you actually play it, it's really straightforward and easy to learn.

This game has a fantastic system of leveling and progression, if you can find a group that is dedicated to playing through the whole campaign.  The game definitely improves if you have more than just the base campaign and characters as the same missions over and over can get pretty stale pretty quick.  Setup is also a bit of a chore, but once you are past that, it is a great game.

I had fun with this, and I like the idea of a competitive campaign, but I think there are too many little things with the design that would keep me from giving this a high rating.  For such a simple game, there are many little rules exceptions and things to remember, and the balance is way the hell off on a bunch of the cards.  The game is a luck-ridden, chaotic hellscape that somehow actually kind of works.  It's a 'take that' game where the punishment you can dish out to your opponents is pretty fair and usually requires some risk on your part.  I enjoyed the art and the minis, and I like the simple combat system, I just wish it worked a little more cleanly.

Rating after 1 play with 4 people:

One of my favorite games this year and a solid contender for best game of the year. 

It is a competitive dungeon crawl with lots of dice chucking and special powers. Eric Lang has done a wonderful job of eliminating anything that isn't fun. What you end up with is fast paced zany dungeon crawl with enough tactics to not become too fluffy. As you play, the winners shape the campaign to their advantage but the penalties for loosing are not too difficult to overcome. We had at least 2 "jump up from the table" moments and the ending was so fun that everyone will remember it for a long time.

Interesting.  Lots of high quality minis.

The PVP aspect is neat, but the game requires multiple scenarios to be played in order for the entirety of the game's mechanics to become relevant.

I'd rather have a more complex game for the long haul adventure type game, but this may be better for the young teens.

Also, I'm not all that fond of how the critical hits can explode of to infinity. I think every die should only get to explode once.

Great components. Action packed gameplay with a lot of choices for how to level up your characters between games. However, while most of the game is a blast, the last game of the campaign is awful - too hard to get into a position to win yourself, but very easy to hand the win to someone else. Rating would be an 7-8 with a better end game.

A great competitive dungeon crawl-like game. Despite being really random,the game still has a surprising amount of depth to it.

I still haven't completed an entire campaign, but I've been very impressed with it so far

My two younger boys absolutely love this game and ask me to play it with them all the time.  It's the game that they like the most which I also truly enjoy playing.

I was itching to try this one out because I love dungeon crawls and the miniatures look great.  I only got to play one non-campaign game, and it left me a little unsatisfied.  The heroes and minis are great, and the action/combat system is pretty good.  But the objectives felt off a bit.  The main thing you were trying to do is kill the other people.  But you only get credit for the killing blow, and the average hero takes 2-6 attacks to kill.  So it's like we are all attacking each other, but you mostly just want to attack the guy with low health and hope you get lucky.  And by the way, there are some monsters standing around that you can attack for no reason.

While I was pretty underwhelmed, I do see potential here.  Obviously the game is beautiful, and I think the campaign play would open things up a lot.  We didn't get any new items, so the customization was minimal.  I also really wish this game was cooperative, and I hear there is an expansion to make it so.  Anyway, the jury is still out.

I have yet to find another semicooperative game where the mechansim of semicooperation works just as well as it does in Arcadia Quest. You'll have to (and you know you want to) pound your coplayers but if you exaggerate it you'll be running into danger the whole group will be too weak for later quests. And a single player cannot do it all by himself. There's room for lots of negotiation. Along with the stunning minis plus great hack'n'slay dungeon crawling feel make this a very fun game. However I don't understand why they didn't include different setups for different player counts. It's hardly understandable why you have the same amount of monsters at the same strength no matter how many guilds are involved.

Having played several games in campaign I find my love of this game has finished a little. The game is best balanced with full on PvP and that's not my favourite way to play. Still this is a great game

Seems really good so far. There are a lot more rules than I anticipated, and even after reading them you still have to re-check for a number of specific issues that come up during a game. Also, the setup takes quite a bit of time. You have to check the scenario guide and setup the tiles, then put out monsters in specific locations all over the board, put out the spawn points, then set out a number of doors, then put out extra tokens such as quests and treasures.

Other than that, it's fun. The various characters really change up the game. Some of the abilities can seem trivial, but the seem to all have a use. One guy can sneak past enemies without being attacked, making him good for stealing treasure. One guy can attack back after he gets attacked, so he's good to march into enemy territory.

The Player vs. Player combat is interesting because you usually only get credit the first time you kill an opponent's character, so there is little incentive to keep attacking the same player. This seems like a smart design that fixes issues that other free-for-all battle games can have.

Haven't played the campaign yet but it seems to be really well done. Rating could go up or down with more plays.

This game really shines when you continue to play with your guild.  I really enjoy getting new items and finishing quests.  The combat is simple but does have quite a good amount of strategy.  The only reason this isn't a perfect 10 is because it takes quite a while to setup and take down.  I would say about 30 min of downtime for setup and take down once you've played a few times.

My 10yr old daughter and I just finished the campaign and we had a lot of fun. We didn't read the winning condition ahead of time and we're disappointed to discover that you win the whole campaign by winning the last quest. We assumed that tallying up the medals at the end of each quest would affect who won. If we play the campaign again we will probably use house rules that others have established for winning the campaign.

Beautiful looking game. Had some fun playing with my daughter and look forward to playing through the campaign with a group of her friends. This is a terrific beer and pretzels game with a good amount of depth and lots of fun interaction. I may rate this higher in the future but these type of games (the dungeon crawler) are not games I am passionate about. They are perfect for certain moments when you want something light or fun but I don't dwell on them. This is definitely one of the best of these type of games.

Fun title. I don't normally get into the more aggressive pvp titles (much prefer cooperative or less directly competitive games)... This one is just a lot of fun all the same. Does have the common issue of long setup time that seems to plague most miniatures games these days -a few extra baggies for various tokens will help, but doesn't necessarily 'fix' the problem.

Arcadia Quest é um bom jogo: regras simples e bem fácil de entender - basicamente é mover e atacar, ou atacar e mover. Existe escolhas sobre quem atacar, de onde e com qual arma, porém, no geral, são decisões simples.

O ritmo da partida é acelerado - turnos são rápidos e o downtime, mesmo em 4, não chega a atrapalhar. A qualidade dos componentes é excelente - as minis são ótimos e bem características, não optando pelo estilo realista e indo mais para a caricatura/anime, o que alguns não gostam, mas eu achei bonitas e bem feitas.

As mecânicas incluem bastante sorte mesclada com as decisões - ataques podem errar em momentos críticos, defesas falhar mesmo com muitos dados, e ainda há a sorte em pegar os tesouros espalhados e até na distribuição dos itens para aquisição. De qualquer forma, o jogo limita bem a disparada de qualquer um ao fazer com que haja um limite de 3 itens para comprar após cada cenário - então mesmo alguém que teve muita sorte num cenário não vai quebrar a banca. Ademais, as mecânicas empurram ao confronto direto - as Guildas (as equipes de 3 heróis dos jogadores) irão brigar entre si, pois 2 dos 3 objetivos requeridos para vencer um cenário podem vir de derrubar heróis dos outros. Ter um personagem derrubado não é tão ruim - basta descansar e ele volta, às vezes até numa posição bem melhor, e com todos os itens prontos para a ação. O problema de cair é perder uns tesouros e, no cenário seguinte, ter a chance de sair com uma maldição complicada. Entretanto, o Arcadia Quest está longe de ser uma Cúpula do Trovão de heróis - porém será preciso lutar entre si, e sei que em muitos grupos e pessoas não apreciam isso.

Meu problema principal com o jogo é o antijogo que ele permite e incentiva. Muitos chefões dificilmente são derrotados num golpe só - e os locais onde os objetivos estão costumeiramente encontram-se protegidos, o que necessita que uma criatura seja vencida antes do objetivo ser acessado. Isso leva a todos ficarem de "abutre" nos outros, buscando aproveitar as chances abertas pelos outros - tentar pegar a morte de um chefão, após outro ir antes e dar algum dano. Ou esperar que alguém mate certo monstro, para ir até o objetivo/tesouro antes. Assim, várias vezes, fica-se num "vou-não-vou" que é o que mais toma tempo no jogo - quer-se avançar, atacar, mas sabe-se que, se o resultado não for o esperado (e, como disse, há bastante sorte envolvida), dar-se-á chance as outros. Aí os lados tentam esperar, bloquear com dois personagens e/ou malandrear de qualquer maneira que lhes permitam não entregar o ouro a algum aproveitador. Infelizmente é um mal do jogo, e quanto mais jogamos, mais isso ocorre e mais cuidadosas (e demoradas) as pessoas se tornam. Esse não parece ser o verdadeiro espírito do jogo, e mais um problema "gamer", no entanto ele está ali. Fica o aviso e veja se seu grupo saberá lidar com isso.

No geral, o Arcadia Quest diverte o suficiente - sem muito comprometimento nem pensamento profundo: é realmente para ser um jogo leve de rolar dados e bater nos outros heróis e nos monstros. Não querendo que o jogo seja mais do que isso, você estará feliz. Se desejar mais, há opções melhores.

Absolutely love this game. The game really revolves around its campaign system, which is just so addictive - after finishing one game you will want to start the next one, just to try out your new equipment! As a miniatures game I like this better than, for example, Kaosball. It is similar to, but also better than, City Of Thieves (although not for everyone, because COT offers some more decisions during the game and not everyone likes to play a campaign). The game is just a superb blend of simple and intuitive rules, a short playing time, very little downtime between turns and an interesting campaign system. Pretty rare for this type of game. Bring on the expansions!

It has a nice blend of randomness and strategy. And a large dose of pure fun. It gives you just enough incentive to screw over the other players, but reigns it in by not letting you win if you only PvP.

Amazing production - the minis are gorgeous, and the tiles are well illustrated.

Plenty of variety in the base box too - don't worry about all the KS exclusives out there.

After finishing our first full campaign, I have to say this is one of the most fun games I have ever played.  After every scenario, we wanted to play the next one, to see all our cool new loot and fight more powerful monsters!  I am already excited to start a new campaign with new characters; either using all the scenarios we skipped on our first campaign, or the Beyond the Grave campaign.  So far, we have played 2-players and 3-players, which seem to be played two different ways: 2-player campaigns are more of a race to win first.  3-4 player campaigns are also a race, but also feels more head-to-head and competitive.  I feel like 4 players will be the most fun, so I can't wait to start another campaign with another couple to see how that goes.

Each play seems to make me love this game even more than before.

It's a silly romp where that's light on rules and heavy on conflict.  Really it plays like an Arena more than a dungeon crawl.  There's no where to hide and vendettas will grow.  Should be obvious, but if dice frustrate you at all then this game will also.  You have to be okay with odds swinging wildly.  You might roll 5 hits and think you've easily vanquished that hero with one hit point and then he pulls an insane string of defensive "crits" and ends up killing you next turn instead.  If you're fine with that and can laugh in the face of your own misfortune, then this game is devilishly fun.  The game is light, but the tactical decisions are there, you have to weigh your choices constantly and look ahead for potential traps for those unsuspecting heroes in other guilds.  Some turns you might just be moving to set up for a future turn, or passing completely to refresh your characters, the game keeps trucking along briskly.  

The charm comes heavily from the video game feel, it's exciting. The production is beautiful, it's all flash and pizzazz and unsuspected thrills.  The whole concept of building up heroes, and gearing up as you play through scenarios that really sells it for me.  Great fun!

I will say that if you just play a random one-off scenario and wrote the game off, you're  missing out.  I'd rate the one-off scenario experience a 7 or so, playing through a campaign is magic.

It's kind of surprising that this kind of FPS-style deathmatch gameplay hasn't been ported to board games before, and that the first game to bring it in is a fantasy romp.  Nevertheless, here it is.  This skirmish, attack-first gameplay works well and is quite quickly resolved, but I'm not sure there's much game here.  There's little of interest beyond tactically trying to meet your goals as quickly as possible, and the portals make the board very, very small.  There's an awful lot of luck in this game, and a few die rolls will swing the game.  I get the sense that the campaign game is the real way to play this game, but I don't see that realistically happening for most groups.  On the plus side, the miniatures are truly incredible.

RATING: 7.5
Only played a single (easy) scenario and a single round of a second (medium) scenario.

Infinitely better than the awful, neverending Super Dungeon Explore.

First game was like a four/five-way boxing match won on knock-out in the first round. Rush in bash opponents and monsters and after a few rounds someone achieved the required three goals (fx. kill two different opponents and three monsters or close/touch two portals). Lots of dice rolling. Gameplay primarily card drafting to put together your three-character team and equipment and tactical combat.

Good fun - not instantly great like Blood Rage but likely to improve with full campaign play with player/equipment progression and more difficult scenarios.

Good enough to definitely kickstart the new Arcadia Quest: Inferno stand-alone game/expansion - excellent value with all the Kickstarter exclusives; probably also the optional new pets (sidekicks) and dragon (extended end-of-campaign co-op scenario) expansions. Still not decided if to go all in and also get the original base game and the Beyond The Grave expansion for even more heroes and the two additional campaigns.

Very unlikely to go completely mad and get all the optional small, 1-2 figures heroes, monsters and pets packs - there are plenty with just the many Kickstarter exclusives and with the original base game and/or the Beyond The Grave expansion there would more than you would ever need/play.

The minis are in a really fun style. You wouldn't know it from the length of the rule book, but the rules are pretty easy to understand. As long as one player fully understands monster activations, your group is good to go.

played @ Essen 2014. Nice game, but wasn't what we were looking for. Nice minis and other playing materials. If you are looking for a campaign driven arena type of game, this might be it. For me there was too much luck involved. I rolled terribly and there was no way to accomplish anything unless you rolled at least decently.

RATING: 8
Good streamlined game system that feels different from  dungeon crawl style games due to the PvP competitive aspect. I like the sense of progression and that the campaign is only 6 games long, you could probably play it in a single sitting if you had the day set aside since the games are relatively short. The set up time is a bit of a beast and sometimes takes longer than the game itself which is the main downside.

Waiting for Inferno to arrive before jumping back in - painted all the core box monsters and some heroes.

Advantages
+ Lots of fun, laughs at 3/4 players
+ Great characterful miniatures
+ Quite simple rules set
+ Fast turns
+ Achievable campaign length
+ Still fun for one off games
+ Entertaining to paint

Disadvantages
- Set up time
- Degenerate combos (poor character balance)
- Loses its appeal at 2 players
- Expansion bloat
- Luck fest

Fun game. Only reason my rating is not higher is because I've only played it once. I'm guessing after some more playthroughs and additional leveling that it will either go way up or down. Time will tell!

This is a fun boardgame with some really nice minis. I'm sad that my boards are a little warped, but they don't get in the way of the mayhem. Not to be played with people despise backstabbing, or think that dice own them.

I haven't won yet, and I'm having a blast.

i bought this game as a bundle with promos and expansions. i paid a really good price for it and although i didn't seem like a game i would enjoy but man this game is great! i really like that "arcade" feel to it. you die, you re spawn, simple and that campaign mechanic is awesome

Awesome game. Makes for great stories. I like the combat system, I like drafting in this game, the gear is nice and interesting, monsters are cool etc. Campaign games are always hard to bring to the table because it implies having the same players at each session, but the short time for playing a quest makes up for it, as I normally only require two game sessions to cover a whole campaign play.

Love it but just can't find the right group to play an entire game. Team start snowballing after 1 or 2 victories.

Fun game play, worried about falling behind early and not being able to compete. Shall see how that plays out as our campaign continues.

Tentative rating based on a single solo play.  Minis are nice.  Combat rules seem pretty standard.  Have not had a chance to explore the campaign aspects yet.

It’s not good 2 player and it’s a straight dice chucker. Probably a fun beer and pretzels games with 3+. Maybe.

Really enjoyed AQ. Played 4 scenarios with my fiancee and we had a blast.

Decided to back the KS for Inferno the same day I got the original. Next day I went out to get Beyond the Grave.

Because of my love for AQ, I have been looking to make my foam box layout, my own custom hero cards, a DIY dice tray, and possibly painting the miniatures myself one day.

Easily my favorite 4 player game.  Always fun to play and great to get your friends riled up with the pvp action. Minis are awesome and not too bad to set up.

I've played two full campaigns so far and simply love the game! When playing with the right group this game leads to tons of fun. Quick game play, low entry level and a lot of head to head combat!

If you have a consistent group of four players and like player conflict, this should be on your short list of games to check out! This would be an easy 10 for me except for the player count stipulation.

Each player controls a "guild", a team of 3 heroes, in an effort to dominate a scenario by completing 3 objectives first, killing monsters, finding treasures, and stopping the other players from doing the same! Then, the players can take their guilds through multiple scenarios, building them up along the way.

Once you jump the hurdle getting to know the rules, there's a lot of fast-paced mayhem to be had. 

The core box alone is fantastic--don't worry about missing out on the Kickstarter extras! There's plenty of expansion material on the retail market so that you don't have to worry about getting enough variability to keep things from getting dull.

Terrible first experience. Randomness pretty much defines this game, with critical explosions and unreliable defense dice it gets rather stupid. Also, so much grienfing...

It doesn't help that I hate the art style.

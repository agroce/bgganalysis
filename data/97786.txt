Rating based on one 2 player game.  Small World with bells on and a load of new races and powers.  Great fun....

Pick funny race. Do nothing. Roll dice. Do nothing. Pick another race. Do nothing. Roll dice. Do nothing.

Surprisingly shallow. Worst case of "Call me when it's my turn again."

As good as the original, plus a few fun bonuses.  I played this version with 3 new players and they did fine, tho some of the powers are a bit more advanced.  Many of the powers have to do with going into decline.

Attacky, gaudy (although oddly beautiful), but clever, I enjoyed playing this for real after many games of the original Small World on iPad. The game can be affected by AP with some opponents, leading to down-time issues, but otherwise it's all rather good fun.

I have too many good, new games, so I don't get to play this as often as I would like. Definitely a great little gateway game. I think I even prefer this to the original. But that might change tomorrow. Or the day after. Or...

I like the variation of the map/relics/new races, etc.  However it is Small World again, but that's not a bad thing.

The question is do you need both versions? If you only need one, which one is better?

I'll give the slight nod to the original because there's more expansions, but I honestly think the relics give the Underground base game an edge.  Either one is a great choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My exposure was limited, but I would certainly give it another try.  It has a lot of variety to keep it interesting and fresh from game to game and has the flexibility to play as little as 2 players or significantly more.  If you are looking for some light conflict, it will scratch your itch.

RATING: 7.5
A decent variant of Small World (the normal version). It tries to introduce some new mechanics to the game, which it does well, but which also causes the "always" straight-forward rules of Small World to change into the "often" straight-forward rules of Underground.
The art of the board is nice, but not surveyable at all. That leads to frustrating mistakes which could easily have been avoided.

The races are a little more balanced than regular SW, but that means they're a little blander as well. Some, like the Drow, are incredibly situational. The relics and places add in a bit of spice and perhaps imbalance which puts it pretty much back into the same realm as the original game. Not sure how I feel about the river, or the power that can conquer it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

More of the same. But to make it different, now there are relics and places to attempt to control.

There are much worse games out there, but there are also much better ones...

RATING: 10
Great expansion, stand-alone game. 

Adds more creatures, features and abilities. 

Prefer this over the original map due to the diversity, but still use most of the creatures/abilities from the original, so both is a must have for all fans. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Our initial reaction was that this version is better than the original as it addressed the OP issue with some of the special abilities in combo with specific races in vanilla Small World (most notably the Magicians). In the original, there was usually one or two combos that were sought after during the drafting process because they seemed clearly more powerful than the rest. In this version, the combos felt much more balanced, but also muted in the sense that there was little excitement and appetite to spend a little extra to pick one up. Also,  it feels like there are more entry points onto the map, which made it easier to start your first incursion, but made it more challenging to be able to figure out where your next attack was coming from to the point where it was too chaotic to bother tracking. In addition, the river down the middle of the map was a huge deterrent in moving units across it to the point where it felt like you were playing on different, unconnected maps. Still, a solid game overall, but one in which the vanilla version would probably be preferred.

I wasn't sure I was going to like it (got a bit tired of Small World), but this game was a pleasant surprise. The new 2-player board is waaaay better than the original, the game feels more crowded with difficult terrain and impassable regions, I really like the river, the relics and places add a lot of tactics, and the new races and powers are really fun. So, all in all, this is an improvement over the original Small World.

RATING: 7
Pros
- Excellent gateway game
- Cool power and ability combos
- Awesome components and board
- A tray for you to keep your pieces
- Set up is fairly quick
- A war game that is not about rolling dice for combat 

Cons
- Downtime could be a problem since there's nothing to do on someone else's turn

Sold/Traded because:
- Got burnt out after a while
- I have other gateway games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Clever little game that is easy to learn and looks really pretty.  There's more thinking going on here than in regular Small World, where you just sorta take what you can get and occasionally attack whoever you think is in the lead - having spaces with various abilities makes decisions a bit harder, which is nice.  Also, the powers are more based around trickiness and movement, less raw combat stuff than in base Small World.  Not a fantastic game, but reasonably solid.

Stands alone, great on its own. "Darker" sounding races is a simple twist. Conquering regions occupied by "monsters"--equivalent to the "lost tribe"--to gain a Righteous Relic or Popular Place gives a reason or an incentive.

It is slightly more complex and complicated than the older brother, SmallWorld, but I would not say it brings a lot extra. I like the darker setting, but in terms of strategy it is still the same, an enjoyable game, with decent replayability (is this even a word?) and I would like now to see the expansion to combine both of them into a mega game. Until then, this is a fair 8.

Update: decreased to 7.5 after one more play and due to adjusting all my rating to reflect better the reality.... at least my reality.

This game is a great refinement to the original. The river opens the map for conquest, the races/powers care about terrain types in all new ways, and the monster guarded treasures give reasons aplenty to go out of your way to conquer your neighbours. Now, combine all that with the other expansions... JOY! 8-D

Excellent family or friend game, that really differs in two players or more.
Good global balance, lot of replayability, cut-throat moves, easy to teach and play, while highly tactical.
It hits the table the most often in my friend group that prefers light games like catan or carcassonne, while far deeper than those.

Compared to small world, seems more equilibrated, more varied (thanks to artifacts), and less fiddy to play, because it uses generally less tokens.

This version scores 1 higher than regular Small World due to the neat treasures you get.  It adds a lot to gameplay.

I know many people love this series of games, but I'm not a big fan.  I love the race-creation mechanic (where you combine an adjective with the race to give it a unique blend of powers and rules), but, as someone that enjoys games like Axis and Allies, Fortress America, Twilight Imperium, etc. the combat is just too simplistic and "Euro-ish" for me.  The art is great and My kids love it, so it scores higher than the 5/10 I'd probably give it otherwise.

Visually this is more appealing to me than the core Small World game, and the races are just as charming though some do feel redundant mechanically with preexisting choices. Anyway, it's the cutesy 'Underdark' of the Small World with some hilarious race choices like 'Dark Mime', and some relics and monster mechanics (which sort of fill in the role of the Lost Tribe).

I find that there is too much variation in the usefulness of the locations and artifacts.  Since you have to spend extra guys to grab one, it becomes a crapshoot that destroys what is good about Small World: find the most points for yourself while denying the most points to the player(s) that is the real threat.

RATING: 3.9
Virtually the same as Small World: A fun, light-weight game, which suffers from "bash the leader", and doesn't have a whole lot of staying power. (The initial promise of near-infinite replayability turns out to be hollow, as most of the powers and races are too similar in execution for the variety of combos to really offer anything new after a few games.)
I like the new dynamics of the river and monsters, but think the new races / powers are lacking compared to the original set which came with Small World, hence a slightly lower rating for this clone.

I love Small World, but Underground added a few unnecessary rules with the relics and places. I could do without those, but I understand the river and making everything tighter. I'd like an expansion for Underground to add more evil races, but it seems like they're running out of ideas...
EDIT TO PAST REVIEW: I just played this last night and I realized a reason why my friends may not want to play this game. Learning the races and special powers takes a lot of time. Then, adding in relics and special places (which do add to the game, unlike my initial thoughts) makes the learning curve even steeper. I want to play this again, but I know I need to help the other players to learn the races.

As far as I love Small World, I still can’t share the same fondness for Small World Underground: somehow it feels like the original game’s winning formula, its simplicity, has been lost with its successor, too thwarted by the increased complexity and the attempts at making it more strategic.
Simply put, it doesn’t feel true to the original game.

I really appreciate the attempt at giving Underground its own feeling with both the relics/popular places and the river but sadly they look only half-successful: the deeply thematic river only manages to split the game in two concurrent subgames while the added relics/places are now so powerful and central to the game they induce players to concentrate on them only and neglect anything else.

Even the new races and abilities aren’t fully satisfying since most of them are or feel too fiddly, such as the increased number of powers activating only when declining a race are. They surely make a player’s choices and overall gameplay more strategic, thus requiring a better planning of their actions, but I feel uncomfortable with this higher layer of complexity: I play Small World because I want to have a light fun, not because I crave for a heavy game requiring deep thinking.

A longer review can be read [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/780621/shortly-small-world-underground]here[/url].

[b]Update[/b] - Two years later, Underground is still way too clunky for me to be as enjoyable as the original Small World: thus, in April 2014 I lowered my rating from 8 to 6.

Having played both Small World and Small World: Underground, it's Underground that's earned my love. I like both of them - they're pretty quick to play, and it's difficult to feel picked on (unless everyone is ganging up against you) - but there's a little extra randomness to Underground that appeals to me. I like enough randomness in a game to make up for my inability to plan ahead!

This one pains me, but after repeated attempts, I just don't enjoy this. I love the declining mechanic, but the game just turns into a "take that war."

That would be fun, but all of the various little powers and artifacts and whatnot suggest that the game will be more strategic.

Basically the same game as Small World.  Actually a pretty great game just not necessary if you own SW.  Although for a completionist the extra races and abilities tile is a no brainer.  The board is also gorgeous.  Just doesn't add much to SW original.

A more interesting version of Small World, that doesn't need expansions to spice things up like the original.  I especially like the addition of relics and places of interest to the game.  The wife and kids like this a lot so I'm usually willing to give this a go.

RATING: 9
I've heard a lot of complaints about the garish nature of the graphics, but I like them. It's underground. Sure, it'll require a little visual reorientation, but I like that it's quite visually different from the core game, and parsing the information isn't so hard once you get used to it. The original had some information presentation issues also, the new one isn't notably different in that respect. In my opinion anyway.
---
Quirkier racial and special powers make for a somewhat less elegant game, and the artifacts can encourage conflict ... But let's face it, Small World was never short on conflict to begin with, and some of the artifacts and places are pretty strong and can be swingy in a way that doesn't feel great, and there are some not-terrific interactions between places and powers (the powers that protect a space even after decline become very strong in combination with a decent-scoring place). Also, some of the Monty Python referential humor feels a little out of place. Lastly, it's not mechanically or thematically straightforward to combine expansions and sets. Most things are fine, but you'll need the ability to edit on-the-fly.

Still, with that off my chest, this is still Small World, which is a surprisingly good game. Not as clean as the original, so introduce people to the game with that, but some of the new quirkiness makes things interesting tactically, and despite having so many powers already they've managed to come up with a bunch of good new ones. The appearance is generally great and up to Days of Wonder standards, and the insert actually works :) All in all despite some minor irritations I'm quite happy with my purchase.

This gets the same rating as plain old Small World from me.  A nice alternative if you want to play pretty much the same game with a small twist!

The most notable change is that when you beat the "natives", which are now monsters in Underground, you get to unveil a special ability for that space of the board, which is usually something somewhat powerful for whoever controls that space during the rest of the game.  It's an interesting new twist, making various map spaces more desirable than usual.

You can also use the Tunnels promo to combine your vanilla Small World and this into a mega game!  It's a bit of a pain with all of the bits, but works well and is fun!

Suffers from a lack of expansions. Otherwise it is a nice twist on Small World. Would love to see underground specific expansions.

RATING: 6
After playing the original Small World, I decided to give this a shot as well.  There is a new relic system that adds an interesting component, allowing players to take control of new powers while they control the relic.  Unfortunately, this causes the players to just fight over control of the relics.

I do appreciate that the game forces the players to battle for territory a bit more, but I think some of the new elements over-complicate the game a little.

If I had to choose, I would say the original is a little better.

I really like Small World, and as such, also quite like the Underground standalone. That being said, I think it adds a few too many things that make it seem a bit gimmicky, and in some cases potentially unbalanced. I enjoy it, but I think I prefer the base rules with race/special power expansions.

The board is a little too dark for our preference (in comparison to the original Small World board- makes it more difficult to distinguish different territories, etc.) and the rules (in regards to race and power abilities) aren't as clear or concise as the original's (perhaps a translation issue?).
I do like the addition of artifacts and wondrous places though - adds another element to the gameplay.
And at the very least you can use those artifacts and places, along with the new races and powers, in the original game!

This area control game I took a little bit to warm to. The overwhelming feeling of all the different races and abilities was a lot to take in.

This really does build on the original game, and the rules are written such that it assumes you have already played Small World.

I've now played this game about a dozen times and I very much want to be play it more. So, in my opinion, this is a very good and enjoyable game.

I've played the original aboveground Small World several times too and to me it really doesn't matter which one of these two games you use. My friend has owned the original one for a couple of years so I didn't want to buy that one. The rules are pretty identical (give or take a few minor extras) so the difference is the map and the races.

I like this game because this is a strategy game but not a too deep one. There are days when I and my friends want to play a game of TI3 and then there are days when we want to play a couple games of the more lighthearted Small World. Both are enjoyable in their own ways.

RATING: 8.45
This is in essence a mega-expansion if you already have the original Small World.  There are many new races and special powers which can be mixed into the regular game if you choose.

There are 2 key differences that make this unique.  First, a river runs through the center of the board, which requires just one unit to conquer, but can not be claimed (Krakens being the exception).  This makes the geography a bit more complicated.

Secondly, the lost tribes have been replaced with "monsters" which when defeated open up either a special place or a relic, all granting additional powers.  Special places remain stationary, while relics can be moved, but are dropped when a race goes into decline.

Not drastically new or necessary, but if you enjoy Small World, this will provide new twists of fun.

The game goes against the 8th general preference about games in my profile.
I stripped another full rating point for the particularly misplaced hidden trackable information (HTI) rule about the Victory Coins (see my 6th general preference for why I don't like any HTI in games and detract at least -0.5 rating points for any noticeable HTI). I would like Small World considerably better with a normal VP track which shows the current VP of all players. This would also alleviate the multiparty-conflict problem alluded to above: At least it would be much easier to specifically target the leader.
I like the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamemechanic/2015/variable-player-powers]Variable Player Powers mechanic[/url] (see my 11th general preference).

I love Smallworld. It is one of my 10s. And I have been really looking forward to see Small World Underground. And after two games I have to say, that I'm not disappointed, but also not excited as I expected. SWU is more complex than original SW. This brings some new tasty flavor to the game, but also opens place for rules misunderstanding and confusion. Smallworld was better for its simplicity which SWU is losing. I enjoyed first two games and will most likely play it again soon, but still original is better game for me... at least for now.

Overall this game is ok of you love Smallworld why not pick this up. The only thing that really irks me about this version is because the river is always down the middle it feels like odd number of players always end up in someone dominating or one person being shut out. The river is passable but it seems like most of the time people would rather not use a unit on the river and just use more units to kill other peoples units. The new relics and places tiles are ok but make the ease of explaining combat more difficult to new players.

This is a basically a new version of Small World, which in turn is a new version of the much earlier game, Vinci.  The Small World rules are almost identical, with some added extras such as a river, which you can cross but can't remain in.  Also the neutral sites now guard sacred places and relics, which grant random but powerful abilities when conquered.  Overall, if you love Small World, you'll want this for the new races, traits and maps.  If you simply like the game, then what you get here is a very chaotic variant.  Also, the graphics are dreadful - ugly board and way too garish for a game where sweeping the board looking for detail is important. I enjoyed it, but do not need to own this one.

RATING: 9
The board and counters have excellent graphics. All materials are from fine quality. The boards are two sided and already dictate for how many players each one is fit for play. The interaction is fun and interesting. Rules are fair and clear. Each player starts with a race which has specific abilities and provides certain talents during game play, tries to conquer regions and accumulate gold coins. When the race expands to its limit then it declines and gives way to a new race to enter game with other abilities and fighting techniques. The winner is the one with the most gold coins at game end. Lots of choices and very many abilities are given to each player to achieve their goal. Innovative game mechanics. The end is unpredictable and no game play matches with a previous one.

RATING: 7
The same basic game as Small World, but with a different selection of races and powers and a few new tricks.  The biggest change is the Righteous Relics and Popular Places, which are rewards you get from defeating the monsters that start on the map (similar to the Lost Tribes from the base game), and the new races and powers are fun and creative.

This is kind of a mess.  Graphically, there are some real misfires.  The board is hideously ugly, the black mountains are hard to see.   On the other hand, the race tokens are very clean and distinct.   It's hard to believe, but the rulebook and reference sheets are actually WORSE than those in the original game, and in some places contradictory.   The Relics and Places are a nice idea in theory only.   In practice, they are so much of an annoying lure that the overall tone of the system gets lost.   Plus, they are too random, and just not that funny either.   A number of the powers are redundant, regurgitated from the base game.   The river works well, and the maps are tighter, which is probably a good thing.  But the whole package just feels too forced, like the publisher is just reaching too far.  The advertised semi-compatibility with the base game is a bit misleading - it's not really as compatible or as desirable as they want you to believe.  Underground makes for a nice variant, but the base game plus all the race/power expansions remains a more pure and better format.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What I like most about this is that it is a closed system (at this point at least). The artifacts gives players a little something to go after and adds a little confrontation which is good and needed. It is fun but there's part of me that hopes they keep this as a stand alone thing and use the regular version as their sandbox.

Same as the first game as far as I can tell just with a darker theme.

I love the art.  I really enjoy picking out my race and power combo and thinking about all the glorious things we're going to do together, but as I place my pieces on the board the game just loses its life.  On the other hand, sometimes this game just sparkles magic and I really get into the spirit of my race combo.  I guess, I like this game the most when I play the combos I'm into as opposed to the ones that I think will win the game; and the game's magic just explodes, like the Sun vomiting starlight, when those combos win you the game.  You get pretty damn proud of those Swamp Trolls and Rapid Halflings or whatever.  The people you play with can also really amp this game up too if they're inclined to get into the spirit of their combos.  So, sometimes it's a 2, and sometimes it's a 9.  I'll give it a 5.

Conquering is so simple and yet inevitable that you don't feel picked upon or ganged up on when your races are conquered, especially when they are in decline.

Numbers seem to be a particular consideration and the special abilities a secondary concern but I expect that will shift the more games I play.

Underground offers some differences to small world namely the relics/places. I am still not sure whether this is a good thing or a bad thing yet.

This is a stand alone game/expansion with new races & powers, board, & bonuses.  

I always look forward to the new races & powers, even though some are specific to one of the two maps.

The board is visually striking with bold colors and grabbing graphics.  The board looks busy, but the areas are easily discernible.

As with many expansions of successful games, elements are added that complicate the basic game.  So it is with the added relics & places, which are bonuses.  However, I enjoyed it. The bonuses are so rewarding it has changed the thrust of the game.

Interactions in this game intensified with frequent fierce fighting over the better relics--players could score 20+ points with the right combinations, so take overs were common and extremely expensive. 

I am sure this one will be chosen often by our group--perhaps more than the basic game.  Was generally well received.

Everything great about Small World and then some. The big attraction for me is the introduction of Places and Relics: both add a whole new dimension to the game. Some of the racial and special powers are a little wonky. The original game is pretty intuitive, and all of the powers make immediate sense, but Underground requires pretty regular checking of the rulebook, and some house rulings can be required by weird combos.

I think I like it as much as the original, but not more. My other SW-playing friends seem to agree: none of them felt the need to own it in addition to the original, but everyone agreed that when playing at our house, Underground is the version they would request. :) 

We own the [thing=109632]Tunnels[/thing] expansion, and we're eager to try it out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The powers, races, items and locations are generally are more distinctive and positional (in a good way) and for players to be more aggressive. There's more to think about on each turn, and it's considerably more interesting than the base game.

However there are lots of rules problems and misprints:
* Liches have 5 tokens in the components but 7 in the rulebook
* "Cultist" instead of "Cultists"
* Shiny Orb is "once per turn, per opponent" in the player aids but "once per turn" in the rulebook

There seem to be issues with the balance too:
* Vengeful is strictly inferior to Commando
* Immortal raises the potential for superpowered combos (eg Immortal Iron Dwarves)

The components and art are beautiful, from the regions to the poodle Cerberus.

Largely compatible with Small World (Hill, Underground and Farm spaces don't exist), though many powers are disappointing repeats.

Fantasztikus grafika, egyedülállóan végiggondolt és kvitelezett doboz, jó hangulat, mély tematika. 

Az első (kétszemélyes) játék után kiváncsian várom a folytatást. Egy kicsit félek tőle, hogy hamar monotonná és unhatóvá válik a felváltva pakolgatás. Ugyanakkor a rengeteg variáció, a több játékos esetén előálló több frontos háborúk, valamint némely kiegészítő nagyon ígéretesnek tűnik.
 
Majd meglátjuk! :)

As I expected, this is very much like the regular Small World.  However, there are races and effects that have a bit more going on with them. This diminishes the elegant simplicity of the original game somewhat, but adds just enough new and interesting things to make it a game worth exploring as equally. A bit more fiddly and more referring to the rulebook instead of just intuitively knowing from the tokens themselves what the rules are. A bonus is that I like the theme of this one. A nice, companion piece to the Small World universe.

RATING: 6
This was a tough one to rate because I like [thing=40692][/thing] a lot. However, when rating a game based on how much you want to play it (as BGG encourages you to do), the existence of better alternatives is going to drop a game in the ratings. This one comes in at a 6, but would probably be up at least a couple points if it had come out earlier (I rate the original Small World a 9).

Small World has a great mechanical structure to it. I think some people don't like it because they feel there aren't a ton of choices to make when it comes to actually moving your dudes around the map (and that's at least partially true), but the real game is about deciding WHOM to attack, when to take your civilization into decline (you get a turn of very few points, but you get a new strong civilization next turn), and most importantly, which civilization you want to use. You have 5 choices of race/power combinations but they each cost different amounts of gold. Having the most gold is how you win the game, so taking anything except the first civilization in the queue is going to mean sacrificing points now with the hope of getting more points later. There are tons of great decisions packed into a short playing time, and the cartoony theme really makes this fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.

All that said, if you have to make the choice to play Small World Underground or Small World, it's no contest: Small World wins by a country mile. SW:U has a less interesting map (removes even more decisions from troop movement as it adds features to the topography that are restrictive), special powers that run for a couple paragraphs instead of sentence or two (like the ones in the original), and even a rulebook that contradicts the included player aids. 

Rated simply as an expansion for Small World, it's decent (though integrating them does require some rule changes), but I would recommend simply getting Cursed, Grand Dames, and/or Be Not Afraid, all of which are much better anyway. I can only recommend this to hardcore Small World players who are need more variety than the base game and the three aforementioned expansions offer. Otherwise, stick with the original as this one is pretty much the definition of "bloated".

Simple mechanics and quick to teach, but great variety and new strategies in each play because of the random races/powers combos. Underground adds two new layers with places/relics as well as a river bisecting the map that can be crossed at cost but not conquered. It is a deeper game at the cost of a bit longer play time, but worth it. This is the place to start with Small World, but not essential if you already own the original.

Underground is a stand alone game with all new races and powers. Also new are some special sites and powerful items, most of which are worth fighting over. New maps are also present, but not radically different from the old maps. Underground doesn't stray far from the formula and that's fine. It rates about as well as the original for me: pretty good.

In many ways a better game than the original Small World. This is standalone game, although you can mix it with Small World and vice versa, with certain limitations, but Small World is not required to play. In my opinion the theme is better, the races are better, and there's new game elements that add a lot of depth to the game-play.

RATING: 8
The lightest, quickest, most volatile and most fun game of area conquest with tons of race/trait combos.
You place a very limited number of funny dudes on a quirky map, and there is deterministic battle resolution +1 die. 

Btw: hiding the collected victory points is an attempt to get rid of kingmaking/stopthatplayer discussions, but I find it sometimes leads to even more discussion and (worst case) memorizing enemy VPs.
Many extra game elements for special powers or points.

RATING: 7
This is a bit more complex than vanilla Small World due to the relics and a few other things. I'm a bit mixed on Small World. The game is very mathy and the sheer number of power and race combinations can make one's head spin. 

This is a very well designed game, but I often feel it's a war game that doesn't want you to fight. It feels like combat and attrition is almost always the incorrect choice. I tend to prefer more direct and aggressive war games, so I tend to just be bad at this.

See comments for Small World.

The addition of monsters and the relics/places they protect gives players something else to fight over, replacing the relatively useless Lost Tribes.  In the above-ground version, defeating Lost Tribes was generally a waste of effort (unless your race had something to benefit from it), but defeating monsters leads to an often game-changing reward.

I definitely need more plays before I can give this a thorough evaluation... but so far, it looks to be just as good, if not better, than the original for multiplayer games.  However, 2-player games often result in battles to hold relics/places, and some races seem extremely powerful (e.g. Royal Flames seem near unstoppable with a couple of good relics/places available).

My favourite game. Works really well with any number of players. And its the best next step after giving newbies their first taste of board gaming- their first flavour of strategy. 

Although the strategy feels limited once you've played a number of times. A player's best course of action is fairly obvious and feels pre-determined by the race & power combo and current game state.

The Small Worlds are good games, but I do not think SM and SM Underground are both necessary. We originally bought both base games together, instead of 1 base game and several expansions, so that way we would have more races and abilities. I think that many of the races are too similar, and I wish I had bought only SM Underground. But now that I have both of them, I do not regret it (there are still several races and abilities that can be mixed and extra maps are cool). Just that if I had it to do over again, I would only bought SM Underground. UPDATE: It is a great game, but one that I could do without.

Smallworld was one of the first boardgames I played after discovering games like King of Tokyo and 7 Wonders. The art style is amazing and each turn feels like a pivotal strategy point with all players trying to balance when they should summon a new race to battle with. While it's best played with 3-5 players, a two-player game creates a very different feel and is as equally as fun and challenging.

This one has potential; it feels a bit like a (much) faster, more to-the-point Britannia, and with lot of replay value. However, I only played the 2-player game so far, which I found a bit lacking. I'll revise my rating when I get the chance to experience it with a different array of players.

***UPDATE***
After playing many games, with any number of players, I can safely say that this game is a great choice whenever you want to scratch the itch of strategic confrontation with low luck, but in a short, mellow way. It's a great next step for new players after true gateways like Settlers and Samurai. My rating goes from 7 to 8.

A game is similar enough to the original, however it also includes some interesting new features. A river, which can be crossed, if really needed, monsters, special places and relics. All this adds to the play weight of the game. However, races and special powers of the original game are more natural and more clear. This is understandable, because it is not easy to fit something new and simple in very good and simple game.

Žaidimas pakankamai panašus į originalą, bet taip pat turintis ir pakankamai įdomių naujovių. Upė, kurią galima pereiti, jei labai reikia, monstrai, ypatingos vietos ir relikvijos. Visa tai prideda žaidimui įvairovės ir šiek tiek sudėtingumo. Kaip ten bebūtų, originalaus žaidimo rasės ir specialios savybės buvo paprastesnės ir aiškesnės.

Yes, I copied and pasted, since most of what makes Small World great is the same for this release. But now it takes a darker turn. Underground features more evil feeling versions of the races, as well as relics and a couple more difficult game play mechanics.

Essentially Small World with races/powers which are way less fun both theme- and mechanics-wise: Merchant Tritons, Commando Skeletons or Seafaring Trolls are cool while Quarreling Drow, Royal Iron Dwarves or Fisher Mummies are boooring. Most races/powers seem either derivative from the original or totally contrived. The only significant difference in gameplay is the addition of Relics/Places of Power, which are a nice diversion, but not interesting enough to make up for the significant loss in the fun factor. Still, the game preserves most of the traits that make Small World so great, therefore an above-average rating. Only improvement to the previous game is the new race tokens tray, which makes digging out the last dwarf way less frustrating.

I haven't tried the Tunnels expansion yet, maybe it will make Underground more interesting.

Small World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers. Each player will control several creature/power combinations over the course of the game – spending points to draft these combinations – and will use those creatures to claim control of various subterranean locations. Some locations hold relics or are designated as "places of power", and monsters must first be conquered before a player can claim these special benefits. At the end of each turn, a player scores points for the regions he holds, and the player with the most points at game end wins.

Small World Underground is playable on its own, but can be combined with other Small World releases. The publisher recommends that players be familiar with Small World before playing Small World Underground.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
This one is never as certain as the original Small World. Often it seems like one player is going to win, until another player comes up with the most outrageous relic/race/power/place combo and totally obliterates the current leader. This can happen in the original Small World too (minus the relics and places), but not to the extent that it happens in Underground, mostly because those relics and places push the craziness of interesting power combinations even higher. So it's more unpredictable strategy-wise.

The relics/places are a mixed bag: the added abilities make the game more exciting and cutthroat, but it seems that other areas of strategy can be slightly less tight as a result. For example, mountains are sometimes undermined (hehe) or ignored outright, in favor of the special places and relics, which are often more hotly contested. And with these relics and places constantly changing hands, it's difficult to see the long-term effects of some of the decisions you make. This might also induce more analysis paralysis compared to basic Small World.

About the river: it's great. What a cool feature that can be used offensively (sneak attacks from across the board, at a temporary token cost) and defensively (opponents might not want to bother crossing the river to attack you, when they can just attack someone else right next to them).

I rate this roughly equal to the original, because it's more complex in an enjoyable way, and a bit more varied because of the relics and places, but it's also a tad more chaotic in a way that isn't necessarily good (sometimes the relative straightforwardness of regular Small World is refreshing). I love that the two games are compatible with each other. But for a sequel/expansion, this has quite a different feel to it!

This is a much more vicious and potentially chaotic game - makes for a rip roaring time but if you thought Vinci was better than the original, you'll hate this one worse!

LIKES:

* Fun for a change of pace where the game gives you the option to go after relics and special places that can give considerable advantages (IE, the stinky sock!).
* While there is a lot of conflict in Small World, I feel this game gets even more nasty with a fair bit more to take that in the game where you take points away from people - literally robbing them.
* Brings in different physical dynamics to the game board in that there are various locations around the board one cannot travel into/across and there is also a river which you can cross by spending one guy but it doesn't count as a region for points.  
* Some of the races are really quite interesting and unique in their abilities.  

DISLIKE:

* There are a number of races that feel like a copy of a race in the original Small World.  What's up with that?
* Uncertain about some of the relics as they seem potentially overpowered.  Still, our game score range was relatively tight.

RATING: 8
This features two very minor additions to the core gameplay of Small World: a river down the middle of the map, and a handful of tokens (relics and places) that offer certain bonuses to whoever holds them. Despite being minor additions, the impact on gameplay is significant. In Small World Underground, there is a much greater emphasis on moving around the board, attacking others, and generally doing things other than hiding in a well-defended corner of the map. For the first time in a long time, Small World feels like it's won not only by choosing the right race/power combo, but by making the right moves on the map.

Of course, the downside is that the game becomes a little bit more thinkier, and as a result, I'd probably still use the original Small World as a starting point.

RATING: 8
Possibly this game came into being because the designers had a couple dozen new ideas for races and abilities that they did not want to cram into yet another expansion. Just as likely, the mad genius who illustrates these games sent in some sketches for underworld landscapes and inhabitants, which made everybody go "We have to put this in print".

I agree with everybody. Although it can’t be accused of a lot of originality, the zanyness and attention to detail of the game’s look won my heart over. The counters for the underworld denizens/guardians are a good example of this, with seven different illustrations running the gamut from poodle cerberuses to clanky golems. Totally extranous ruleswise, but just fun to play with.

I’m not sure whether I (or anybody) need to have both the original game and this version, but if you have neither so far, then this is a very recommended purchase.

I find the gameplay dull and lifeless.  I think it has to do with the fact that it is so simple and mechanical, with few interesting decisions.

Small World Underground mini-review:

theme: 8/10
good variety of underground/dark races, there is a perceivable tone mismatch between the goofy art and the serious "race exctinction" gameplay

mechanics: 9/10
great chaotic gameplay and mechanics that allow power swings and setup plays.

pacing: 10/10
game is fun all throughout, early rounds are not boring and uneventful and late rounds are not overly complicated and long.

duration: 10/10
Perfect. Does not end too early and does not drag on for too long.

balance: 7/10
good balance overall, some race/power combos look too strong, but the game duration mitigates that.

Generally a better game than Smallworld, but I would still recommend Smallworld. Underground introduces some really great mechanics that gives some good varied plays, but... The theme. The smallworld theme is so much easier to sell, as it's classic fantasy. Underground is a mix of all kinds of fantasy creatures, but not many well-known ones. If you don't care about theme, then Underground is the one to buy.

I actually like this one a bit more than the original base game. You are never safe on this map and attacks come from all directions. The Powerful Places also give you a lot more incentive to attack certain spots, so you see more races roaming over the map. Also, the absence of the Lost Race tokens provides a lightning fast start with more immediate confrontation.

The downside to this is added complexity and a less streamlined ruleset, therefore making it less appropiate for beginners. The end result is an equally high rating for both base games.

Small World [i]should[/i] be good.  All the clever little parts are there but in the end it just doesn't add up right and the sum is summarily just "some" of the should-be-sum. The issue is that the best strategy is essentially "camp where most profitable to you" but since players build their races to be profitable out of a fixed pool of attributes, it ends up being uncommon for players to be after the same tiles.  And that isn't even to mention that any game that trades on conflict having "camping" as the strategic end doing a great job of aiming down at the closest extremity before pulling the trigger.

Underground at least tries to force player conflict by adding wrinkles in random locations to incentivize conflict, but the punch was pulled and what should have been a quick fix is just shrug worthy.

RATING: 9
I think the only people who like this version less are purists of the original and those that fear its asymmetry.  This game is intended to be unbalanced, so if an opponent is a threat, then temporary alliances must be formed.  Everyone has an equal chance of having powerful or useless combinations come there way, depending on turn order.

RATING: 5
This one is more interesting than I thought it would be on the surface - I somehow thought it would be more Risk-like in play, but the deterministic combat and the way the race+abilities work makes it feel more like a puzzle. Calculating your maximum score for any given turn is one thing, but the focal point of the game is in timing your decline correctly, and considering your choice of race as they are far from equal. Also, the way the powers on the board work can change things up a bit (making things less straight forward).

The downside is that ultimately, if you are the one that gets the least beat on - you'll probably win, but that is more of a player issue (though the hidden scoring makes it easier for a player to mistake another for the leader - If you track so it isn't much of an issue, but that won't always be the case (though if that isn't the case then open scores most likely wouldn't change things either based on my experience)).

Enjoyable, goes by quick and you get to feel clever when you perfectly time your decline so you not only get to steal the perfect race from someone else, but also then use it to force an unwanted decline for another player. The idea of harassing the active rather than the declined race is something people quickly grasp (forcing them into decline to be able to do anything, which will wipe the current race in decline off the board as well).

A good game, I won't compare it to the main game as I've only played that against AIs on a tablet - but they seem about equal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Game in a Nutshell:  Take everything in the original Smallworld (read my comments on that first if you’re not familiar it) and add relics and other stuff that add extra powers for races to fight over.

Played as:  4 player

Pros:  Great art and production. The all-new race powers seem to be more deeply integrated into other parts of the game.  The relics and special places give players a greater focus and objective than simply fighting over just another piece of land. I especially like that the maps have fewer areas to occupy making the game more in your face from the get go with few easy gains.

Cons:  It’s been said that this is a less balanced version of the game and I can echo that. That’s fine in some cases but if you’re playing with a less astute group of players who don’t understand when it’s time to beat up on the leader, then it’s generally not possible to bring balance to the game by yourself.  Getting to a point of familiarity with the new powers takes a bit such that the game begins to move at a good pace without constant reference sheets checks.  The relics and special places only exacerbate that. 

Other:  I haven’t decided yet if I prefer this to the original version or not. My initial reaction is no because so far the additions add complication and reduce accessibility.  Honestly though, I’ll need to play more where my mind might change as I grow accustomed and the game starts to flow at a more comfortable pace.

Best Use:  Smallworld fans looking for more powers and more conflict.

RATING: 9
Almost the same game as Small World (and so mostly the same game as Vinci as well). 

The variety with new special abilities is welcome, but some are slightly more complicated than the original. The relics and places add some complexity as well. I'm not 100% sure the trade-off is worth it.

A slightly more complex version of the original game. This one is in the process of slowly growing on me. At first I did not like it at all, but then I began to see the good things: high replayability, short playtime, and a fair bit of strategy. 

I still don't like that it has so many pieces though, which often fall all over the place when the box is stored. Also, I like the art of the original version better. Good one though!

It's great that Small World Underground isn't the same game as Small World, while managing to maintain cross-compatibility, but I don't love the changes. What I do love is the new races and new abilities, as well as the next-level graphic design. When I first opened the box, I didn't want to pop the pieces out, I was so in awe of the colors. But I don't love the additions of places and objects. The mechanic is handled well; this is not a poorly-designed game by any stretch of the imagination. I just happen to prefer the version without these extras.

I have never played the original Smallworld, but I didn't find this game fun at all. Seemed like a watered down war game wrapped in a light fantasy setting. Seemed longer than the game should be as there wasn't a lot of deep gameplay. Really liked the idea of asymmetrical races being combined with a random special power. This created some light jokes on the way but for me the fun ended there.

RATING: 5
My son loves this game - easily his favorite, and one that will permanently stay in our collection as long as he enjoys it. His favorite parts are seeing how different combinations of races/powers lead to different strategies, and uncovering relics and places of power on the board.

I generally dislike Small World. It feels like a simple bash the leader game that lacks enough meaningful choices to justify the playing time. Hidden scores also bug me: playing with people who don't keep track of the hidden scores can quickly create a boring runaway leader situation, dragging a mediocre experience into an outright bad one.

However, Small World Underground added just enough to design tweaks to be enjoyable for me. River spaces divide the board in an interesting way, while special tiles on the board give shared incentives to battle over. Still not something I'd ask to play - unless my son is sitting at the table...

Still not a favorite game of mine, but I'm willing to play if asked.

RATING: 6
Rating after 1st play. 

Sounds pretty innovative in theory. In practice, it's a pure tactical and classic victory point optimizing game with a small dose of randomness. My main complaint: Prone to analysis paralysis due to a great number of choices, with the decision on the optimal move heavily influenced by the last player's turn. Doesn't get you in the flow and feels mechanical to me. That would probably change with internalized knowledge of the various special abilities, but still, after the first play, I can't really say I loved it. 

Additionally, I have to express a definitive dissatisfaction with the chaotic graphic style that makes it hard to distinguish between the various chits and board information.

If you love Small World and need a change of pace then this is a great choice. You can really get on a Small World kick and play many games in a row. This can lead to wishing to play something else. That's why I really like this Small World. It is a complete change of races and terrain, creating somewhat of an opposite environment from the original game. I also believe it is equally as good. If your game group is begging to play Small World then having 2 options to play will keep the game fresh enough to play Small World more often.

Essentially the same experience as the base game, and gets the same rating - no need to own this if you own the base. It has different races and powers, but really it's all the same kind of stuff. It adds bonus powers to various places on the board which start out harder to conquer, and those bonus powers are granted to whoever owns those spots throughout the rest of the game, making for added interest in what spots to go for. It makes for a slower game to begin with while everyone gets used to all the new powers, but that'll obviously lessen with replay.

8 plays (2,3 and 5 players):

This seems to add variety and some additional goals/ weapons, but doesn't really change the fundamentals of the game. I would suggest the base game over this version. If you want something that gives you a deeper battle experience, there are a load of really good games out there that do this better. Small World (the base version) does what small world does best - provide a light battle/ area control game that is accessible for new players. 

Overall though, a solid game.

When you mix up both versions (Underworld and regular) it becomes too much, just a random mix of powers and effects. Just Underworld works well as it is basically the same game. The secret objects add little and just become target areas. If you have the original, don't bother with this one.

I'd say it's more complex that Small World. The racial powers seem to outclass the title powers a little so I am hesitant to combine it with the older races who seem to be the other way around.

Not sure why this isn't just an expansion but I suppose it's a way of selling new races that are effectively the same as old ones.

Probably what I would consider my "classic" board game, one of the first that I've ever played of hobbyist games.  Risk, but more relaxing, with a surprising amount of depth, especially with this version over the original.

Sometimes less is more: the added complexity of Underground hinders rather than helps the Small World formula.

RATING: 8
Clearly better than the first one, yet keeping to what made the first game good. Adds nice pluses with artifacts and special buildings adding an extra power to your race. However these can be stolen. I think these are actually the strong point of the game. I think inexperienced players can get a bit more confused, as there is also the powers of artifacts and buildings to keep in mind. Some army powers are interesting, others kind of copies of the original game. 

Had to let it go, because it's not as light anymore, and I've got other combat based games that I'd play instead.

I prefer the original Small World but that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the new elements of Underground. I think the map feels a bit tighter, which is better in a 2-player game.

Very similar to the original, this spin off adds a few new features. The primary one is the addition of relics and popular places. These are often game-changers and add a whole new level to the game.

Now I find that you will throw yourself into a situation that may not be optimal to wrest a relic from someone's hands!

This game is just like Small World only it takes place (spoiler alert) underground! A bunch of new race and power combos add fresh air to this game system.

Ok, but don't enjoy as much as the original. Partly I think the graphics are not as appealing.  I see what they were trying to do with the abilities - many of them provide a benefit when in decline, so there is more strategy about when to go into decline - but it just felt a bit too complex for what it is.  In general the races and abilities are less offensive.  The relics are cool in that they make certain areas more attractive to control, so there can be a lot of back and forth fighting over these, but in the end that's probably a losing strategy.

Wasn't quite expecting to like this as much as I do. I think it's probably worked itself into my top ten. It has similarities to Cosmic Encounter what with special powers breaking the rules of the game in unique ways. I love that, and I love the theme to death.

No groundbreaking difference to "Small World". It's a good and rather quick game but something doesn't hit me ... the game fuels expectations that it can't fulfill. Gorgeous artwork, though.
By the way: I hate the rulebook!

EDIT: Traded for the new edition of "Fortress America".

Not quite different enough from the original Small World to really justify owning both, but kind of necessary to justify owning Realms. Overall, it's fiddlier and more crowded than the original, but I can't say that those things improved the game any.

RATING: 8.5
It's as good as the original; I only rate it slightly lower because it re-uses a lot of the same power concepts, applying them to the new terrain types. So in those respects it doesn't seem like a new game. The main differences are the relics/places, which add a new twist, kind of like the cards from the one expansion, and also the river that splits the map, in lieu of a sea that borders it.

This is a lot like Small World, it just isn't as good. I don't care for the way the river divides the map, a few of the places are really powerful, and some of the new races/powers aren't too interesting. There's good though, it's basically Small World, some of the races/powers are very fun, and the items are really cool. Overall it's good, but not as good as the original, and it's more complex.

Great, beautiful game. Rules are easy to understand and the gameplay feels fresh and new. Our first game took of really quick and we tried some tactics. It isn't really punishing for mistakes, so it's pretty newcomer proof! :) I like the way you build up and then disband to build up a new empire.

RATING: 5
Looks like they found a new way to milk the cash cow because who needs expansions when you can just forsake everybody who already owns Small World + expansions and make them buy a new standalone game? Yes, you can match the 2 games together, but it becomes an exercise in matching keywords to irrelevant artwork and is not worth it. Plus some of the new powers just don't mesh at all the old ones, creating problematic overpowered/redundant combinations. Some way to have both an overground and underground game simultaneously, with links to the two, would have been better-integrated.

Can't help feeling this is a reboot, to break from the shackles of previous races/powers, redo the storage tray etc. Maybe this is a standalone instead of an expansion exactly because they couldn't figure out how to add more tokens without the storage tray situation getting silly.

As for the game itself, there are just a couple of welcome bells and whistles. Relics and Places attract attention from all players (starting to be a common theme in euro-fied conflict games), are a good embodiment of the reactive luck that permeates this game (like with the much-maligned Tales of Legends), and give a nice "questing" feel. The dichotomy here is that they do just enough to break up the same-y-ness of repeated Small World plays, but the luck, no matter how reactive, can swing games (which makes it another undesirable trait besides the starting combo draw).

The river divides the board up in an interesting way, and gives another spatial option besides abandoning everything. On the other hand, nothing is standalone-worthy. The artwork is atrocious. I liked the quirkiness of Small World, but the color scheme here makes my eyes bleed, and doesn't mesh with the grotesque monsters. 

If I were a new player, I'd pick Underground, just because it's more flexible and this is supposed to be Small World perfected. As a board gamer and Small World owner, I'd rather Days of Wonder release a good new stand-alone game instead of dressing an expansion up as one and leaving us in the lurch. Reminds me of BattleLore and Ticket to Ride all over again.

Small World: 4+3

The relics and popular places counters add a layer of complication that makes each player's turn more complicated.  "I f I use my racial power and my special power, then I can attack this area and steal the magic sword.  then I will be able to...."  It doesn't make it worse, just longer than the original game and expansions.

RATING: 6.5
Played once with 2P. I've never played the original Small World, but I assume that the two games are very similar. I love the mash-ups of races and their powers, the not-so-subtle pop culture references as well as the choice of when to put your race into decline. The relics and popular places add some complexity, although it seems rather unnecessary. The sterile combat system feels out of place in such a quirky premise. Having near-deterministic battles means that if you're outnumbered, there's simply no way you can pull off a miracle. And I think the game is worse off for that.

A silly, yet strategic game.  Trying to make the most of each turn to gain points is important, realizing that your empire may not last long.  The key is learning when to let your current reign go so you can move onto a fresh one.  The artifacts in this one make things interesting, too.

Több helyről hallottam, hogy azt ajánlják, hogy akinek nincs meg a Small World az már ne is azt vegye, hanem ezt, azt Undergroundot. Érdekes, mert nekem ez a sötét tábla meg sem közelíti az alapjáték szép tábláját. Az újdonság tulajdonképpen a folyó, ami kicsit érdekesség teszi az új térképet, illetve a varázstárgyak és varázshelyszínek. Nos ez utóbbiak elég nagy szerencsefaktort visznek a játékba, ami szerintem egyáltalán nem hiányzott. Vannak kevésbé jók és elég erősek is. Nem teljesen egyértelmű mindnek a használata és szerintem teljesen feleslegesek. Aki már sokat játszott az alapjátékkal annak talán érdekesek lehetnek, de nekem egyáltalán nem jöttek be. Így egy ponttal kevesebbet adok.

I like the gameplay -- like the original, its grown on me, despite being just "OK" at first. Hate the color clashing on the board, hard to look at. When I had the choice between buying this or the original, I went for the original because it looks better, and I thought it'd be a shame to not have staple races like Elves to instead have obscure stuff like Fungus.

Own both now though :)

RATING: 7
I'm a big fan of Small World and own all the content for the base game (3 expansions and the Tales and Legends cards) but stopped once they released this as another stand-alone game.  I finally got to play it to see if there was anything I was missing and I'm glad I stopped when I did.

That's not to say that this is a bad game, it just isn't different enough to warrant a purchase.  It's essentially the same game as Small World, but re-released with new art to make some more money off the franchise.

The maps are essentially the same but with new artwork and new names for the areas.  Instead of a forest we now have a mushroom forest.  Instead of sea areas we now have river spaces.  Instead of mountains we now have black mountains, etc.  It is actually kind of lazy and many of the races/powers in this game are clones of ones in Small World but for these new areas.  For example instead of a race that gets +1 VP for each forest owned at turns end instead it now gets +1 VP for each mushroom forest.

The ones that aren't exact clones are very similar or they've moved a race special ability to a power tile.  For example, the Immortal power gives any race the Elves power to not lose a tile when conquered.

There are still some original ideas here, to be fair, and some fun combos to play with.  The one main addition is the special place and item tiles.  Instead of one lost tribe starting in certain areas there will be two neutral tiles protecting a hidden tile that contains either a special place that gives the holder a bonus ability or an item that does the same thing but can be moved by the discoverer.

In the end though, still not bad and I'll play it if suggested, but there is not enough new here to be worth it for someone who already has Small World.  And honestly, in my opinion, I would still recommend Small World over this to new players.  The art is a little bit too saturated for my liking and the new races and powers feel a little too wonky, like after releasing a game and 3 expansions worth of content they were having trouble coming up with original ideas that worked as well as most of the stuff already released did.

RATING: 8
Reimplementation of 'Small World's' fantasy themed area control/influence conflict game. The big question is does the new setting merit a whole new game as opposed to being just a set of new races and powers? The answer is yes as it offers something fresh to the world of SW and can also be played in conjunction with the original game (with the small 'Tunnels' expansion, annoyingly absent from this game) to create one giant 'Small World' experience. The relics/powerful places, which bestow the owner with an increased number of ways to obtain victory points, are a welcome addition and introduce another level of strategy as players jostle for these to make their races stronger. Some of the races/powers seems to be a bit too similar to their counterparts in the original game, which would suggest that maybe the designer is running out of a few new ideas on that front, but overall this is a very fun game if not taken too seriously.

Gave the races of this one a play. Great races, more variability is always a good thing. Some really nice additions in powers. Races, when compared to their 'base' part equivalents seem to be on the high-power side but the nature of race selection evens this.

Definitive plus that all races except one (spider something) can be merged with the base game with no or minimal rulings (f.e. mudmen: exchange mudpools for swamps and they work in the base game as well. Same goes for Will-o-the-wisps keying into Magical areas).

However, cannot give a good rating yet as the board + relics are other integral parts of this game, which I haven't tried out yet. Will be hard to do that as well, as I use Smallworld mainly when playing with inexperienced gamers, moving on to meatier things when they outplayed this. 

For Smallworld fans, DEFINITELY worth they buy if only for the full set of extra races. Better value for money if only for that compared to any other Smallworld expansion so far.

It's a mixed bag for me.
It's a new map, but there are less ways to move about and less routes to defend your empires from.
It's got new races, but many of them are duplicates of races from the original game.
It makes taking on Lost Tribes more interesting, but it adds another very random element to an already random game.
It's a new way to play, but it shifts the strategy from keeping your empires in tact to retaining control of key locations.

I rate vanilla Small World a 5 because it's light and tactical, but Underground gets a 4 for now. Underground makes the fight for territory a fight for relics and locations and territory. The addition is simply too fiddly for a game system that I think is merely okay to begin with. It's now even more difficult to plan ahead because it's easier for other players to entirely change the board in between your turns. However, I will say that if you love Small World, you'll probably love Underground. And the darker artwork is lovely.

A new twist, and a pretty fun one at that. The addition of the relics and places of power make for a more dynamic, varied but also chaotic game. The selection of races is not as vast as the normal game when including expansions, but they are each more flavorful.

Takes the classic Small World experience and adds random buffs, an awkward board, and boring races, most of which reimplements already existing ideas or copies other abilities for this map specifically. Do not recommend.

The good: It's reminiscent of Cosmic Encounter in that it's a simple ruleset and the players each have their own rule-breaking races.

The bad: All open information and very low luck with a shit-tonne of options make this an AP nightmare.  This game takes waaaay longer than it would if turns were less deterministic.

I love Smallworld, and Smallworld Underground is almost as entertaining. It adds a few rules into the game, but none of them are that difficult. You can mix and match races with the base game as well if you want. The new rules are a lot of fun, like I said, and they do add a different strategy into the game that makes it challenging as well.

So much fun - way better than Risk. I haven't played the original Smallworld, but I'd be interested in trying it.  It takes a while to explain to beginners (putting empires into decline is counter-intuitive the first time you play, I think), but once you know how to play, it's great.  Have played with 2 and 4 players - 4 is better, but 2 is doable.

RATING: 2.5
First Impression:

A family(!) area control game with pseudoconflict.

Good points: It doesn't have luck (just player chaos) and it's pretty. High replayability thanks to the many factions. Clever faction picking mechanism.

Bad points: The gameplay and scope kills it for me. You attack until your race can't push it any more, then go for another race and attack from another spot of the map. All the while hoping that the other players will avoid you. Rince and repeat. That's the whole game. Strategy and tactics end with the selection of your race, so you face downtime even while You play. The game is also fiddly with all the various tokens.

I think it's obvious I didn't like the game..

Mostly like Small World: if you don't like this one one, you likely won't change your mind after playing Underground.

If the game was to be played with open VPs, I would give it a .5 bump in the rating.

As is, the game can derail if someone is not paying the proper attention.

The game do allow for some neat combos and uses for races and powers, but I just hate that players attack on the "supposed leader", when this person is likely in third place and just had a very good last turn, or someone that started well is trounced from round 4 to the last and finish in last.

But, with the right people, I'm down to play it.

I actually thought this was a bit more fun than Small World. It gets a lower rating, because, as a gateway game, it's not as successful as  its older sibling. If you want to know how many armies you must use to conquer a territory in Small World, you simply count the pieces of cardboard already in the territory. Then you apply special powers. The relics and places of power are really fun, but the addition of pieces of cardboard that don't figure into this tally is confusing to someone unfamiliar with hobby games. Since I tend to play Small World with new players, Small World Underground was never going to make it to the table.

+ The Places/relics add more variety for people are looking for that.

+ Compatible races & places/relics with Small World.

- The board is a bit dark and gloomy.
- A lot of special rules/powers to constantly look up, during the game.
- Places/Relics adds even more special rules, you constantly have to look up.

! If I had to do it over, I would buy the regular edition of Small World instead. As I'm not overly a fan of the places/relics and the dark gloomy board.

An improvement on the original thanks to the random treasures players can unlock from conquering specific zones. Now players will have access to 3 (or more!) powers between their racial, bonus, and item powers. It plays faster than the original and feels a lot more enjoyable for players that don't typically play strategy. 

Would probably recommend the original game for competitive play over this one just because the rule set is tighter without the relics, but this game is truly a blast.

I'll admit that I've only played this once while I've played the normal Small World many times. It might have been my mood, but I just didn't enjoy Underworld as much. I will need to update this ranking once I play it more and especially once I link it together with normal Small World and give that combination a try. I didn't like the races as much and the relics seemed like they altered the game too much (at least with my gaming group) to the point where it was just a slaughter fest to get to certain territories.

RATING: 7.5
This game really appeals to my tastes, so probably rating it higher than it deserves from a more objective stance.

The game is relatively easy to explain, players pick up on the strategy very quickly, turns move along at a good pace, the whole game finishes in a nice amount of time.  The way races and abilities are paired up offers TONS of variability and replayability.

Also, the additions to Underground are really great.  Having harder to conquer NPC monsters that grant random rewards really add a new dynamic to how games play out.  The river I didn't like the idea of at first, but now I really like how it splits up the board.  Really makes the Kraken a fun race to play also.

On that note, there are some REALLY fun new races, Spiderlings and Flames pouring out from Chasms for a surprise attack, Cultists summoning Cthulu.

Game is just great fun, one of my favorites at the moment.  Easy to play with lots of layered strategy are always going to be a big win with me.

Small World Underground includes 15 fantasy-themed races of creatures along with 21 special powers. Each player will control several creature/power combinations over the course of the game – spending points to draft these combinations – and will use those creatures to claim control of various subterranean locations. Some locations hold relics or are designated as "places of power", and monsters must first be conquered before a player can claim these special benefits. At the end of each turn, a player scores points for the regions he holds, and the player with the most points at game end wins.

I was not a huge fan of Small World. I found the game play to be both too simplistic and very repetitive. I have had a much better experience with Small World Underground. There are just enough added wrinkles to bring up the difficulty level without over burdening the original, fairly simplistic system. In other words, this is sort of the "gamer's" version of Small World. Much akin to what the Marklin release added to the Ticket to Ride system or that Aquaretto adds to the Zooloretto system. A few tweaks to add more tactics and options, but not enough to really make it a whole new game.

I like this new take on Small World. I might even ask to play it, on a completely voluntarily basis. Trust me on this, That's a huge endorsement coming from me. I might even stop calling the original game "Mancala wars".

Everything that is good in the original is here, except the readability of the map (here the different zone are not so easily told apart, the colors are too gloomy).

Always a wonderful game, one of my favourites.

Definitely the best version of Small World that I've played. The base game can feel bland and samey, but this one makes you fight for certain tokens and that really makes it a better game.

I very much like this game and most people I introduce it to think it's at least decent. A lot of explaining is required for newer players which is cumbersome but once everyone knows the rules/races (2 or 3 plays) it plays much more smoothly and is great fun. I slightly prefer this to the original because I prefer the art and the additional tiles you get in the game for extra abilities.

Only played this once, and it is very good.  I would recommend playing the original game first, if possible, because this one requires that you know all the original rules, plus there are additional rules and things to be aware of with the addition of the Relics.  Great game for those who already love Small World and want a little more strategy, or just want to see different races and abilities.

Easily as fun as the original.  The relics and powerful places are a spunky addition.

The racial and special powers could have used some clarifying, though.  There was quite a bit of headscratching in our early games of Underground, as compared to the original.

I've got this rated just slightly below the original because some of the races and powers seem slightly unbalanced [i](although admittedly it might only appear that way at first and maybe more plays will even things out)[/i].

I've played quite a bit of small world and my rating has declined mentally from a 9 to a 6. The game makes a wonderful first impression. It's funny, flavorful, and tells good stories. As time moves on a lot of the strategy becomes played out. It's a great intro game to strategy or territory control but as I've started playing meatier games I've calmed down a bit with SmallWorld. Definitely a buy if you're new to gaming or play with people who are new.

RATING: 9
I made the arguable mistake of purchasing Underground before the original Small World.  I was NOT impressed.  The game felt pithy with exceptions to rules that seemed vague to begin with.  Does this race's power negate this relic's? Does this power not do the same thing as this other one?  
I'm not sure why, but I decided to get the original Small World, and had almost the opposite reaction.  Why would I bother with this race?  Why is this even a power?  How is the outcome of this game not simply determined by who went first/who had first pick of the random races?
So, I gave [Underground] 6.2 (and 6 for Small World).  Passable, but way too complex [Underground]/simple [Small World] for my taste.
NOW, a year and a bit later, I've revised my thoughts, having played SW again, and properly re-learning the mechanics.  Seeing as SWU is the successor of sorts, I'll actually base this review on my SM review.

So, here is/was my review of the original Small World

New SW review:

Well, after pretty much ignoring this game for ... a couple of years even, I decided to brake it out the other day with my partner and have done a complete one-eighty on this game!
Maybe it was the fact that I RE-learned the rules (which, I might have been less clear on the first few times) or it might be the fact that I've learned the nuance of how to actually gain the victory points that determine the outcome of the game.  
Once you understand that your race is dispensable, and that by the time your opponents have finished their turns, you may not have a race worthy of keeping, you can actually form somewhat of a longer term strategy - valuing not only the synergy of special power and race, but also active and in-decline races.
Also, understanding when to be passive verses aggressive [and to WHOM you should be aggressive] makes a HUGE difference.  Sometimes attacking your opponent will actually net you LESS victory points than simply expanding into unoccupied territory, or even simply passing up any movement whatsoever.  I missed this strategy completely when we first played Small World, opting instead to almost always go for the throat - and then ending all our games baffled as to why the victory points didn't match what we thought were our successes in combat.  
Now that I've figured this game out I have no doubt it will be one that is long lived in our gaming group.  Like Cosmic Encounter, I'm itching to play with different combos of race and power, and to pick up any and all expansions that facilitate those myriad of combos. 

Old SW review (I gave it a 6):

I think i'm missing something whenever i'm playing this game.  Mechanically it seems to work.  But the it's just not... not as fun as it should be.  
The area control and race selection mechanics are good.  In fact, I love the race selection.  It lends itself to interesting combinations of powers, similar in a way to those of Cosmic Encounter.  And you get to play as more than one (you put your race into "decline" and purchase a new one to champion).  
I think a key flaw in the game is that when you do give up on a race, you must essentially skip your turn.  and in a game with limited turns, that means you'll do very little for at least one or two rounds of a game.  
Also, there is the fact that the rules are somewhat vague for certain races/abilities.  The quick reference sheet isn't bad, but with so many races and abilities, you'll be looking at that sheet and clarifying rule vaguenesses for longer than you will be actually moving troops on the board.  
 Again, I feel like i'm missing something that I can't quite put my finger on.  The alternate/expansion, Underground, adds some "item" and "location" mechanics that make the area control a bit more focused - with out it, your movement choices often come down to "am i strong enough to screw over my opponent here? or am i better of not being combative and just pick up points in another empty place?"  The board is small and SHOULD make interaction and "screw you over" happen more often.  But I feel like you never get ahead when you "screw over" people, so why bother?  Atleast the items/locations in Underground make an enemy location more tempting.
I'm not sure what could fix this game, but it just isn't that fun.

Nice variant of the game. Many interesting racial and special powers. Relics and Locations bring interesting things to the table. But a big gripe about the amount of race tokens included in the game. Many of the special powers require you to take more tokens, but in many cases you already have all your tokens on the  board just from the special power-racial combos. This makes many of the special powers useless as you don't get to use them.

I played original Small World once and I really enjoyed it, so I bought Underground for us. Well.. We tried few games, and nobody enjoyed it.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

Mein Lieblingsstrategiespiel, weil es so abwechslungsreich ist und man kaum auf Glück angewiesen ist. Man behält immer die Kontrolle und wenn es schlecht läuft, kann man sein Volk einfach untergehen lassen.

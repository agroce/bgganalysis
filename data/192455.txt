If the goal of this game was to simulate the tedium and boredom you are most likely to face in Mars, First Martians: Adventures on the Red Planet definitely does its job. You are just running around the same circle over and over repairing the colony that has started to disintegrate at an accelerating pace. Moreover, the game is insanely complex for such a shallow experience. There are several things to keep track of and you have to manage quite a number of little details in each phase. Thus it is really easy to make small mistakes that can basically flush the whole purpose of playing down the toilet.  For me it is hard to accept this level of complexity because you are basically just micromanaging several game components/concepts that are more or less identical in their function. The game would have benefited from further abstraction by reducing the number of these modules to just a generic three or maximum of four, so that there would be more room for the narrative, fear for your own survival and excitement of exploration.

Speaking of exploration, this is one of the major sources if boredom in the game. You just do find anything of interest on the planet when you explore it. This may be thematic but I would have wanted the game to rouse my imagination. The only remotely interesting moments emanate from the smart device app that you must download to play the game. It presents a background story to the players and creates all random events taking place in the game. I think this is cool but the thing I would have wanted the app to do for me is all the administrative tasks so that I could have concentrated more on the survival story.

One more thing I could not fully appreciate is the ambiguous use of symbols. More precisely, symbols serving a completely different function have very similar appearance which further adds to the confusion and makes the game susceptible to mistakes.

The bottom line is that if you find satisfaction from re-tightening that one bolt that just keeps unscrewing itself every day, this might a game for you.

Disclaimer: I didn't play the campaigns yet, but I did play every scenario that comes in the box.

First Martians is a game I really really enjoy, which is probably not surprising given how much I like Robinson Crusoe. It offers the same sense of story and the same interesting challenges of its "brother", but it stands very much on his own.

One of my favorite things about the game is the production. When I saw the first photos of the game online, I was a bit worried by the color choices. After a few plays in person though, I found myself really liking the whole visual impact. The best thing about the production, however, is the components: I love the concept of the facility tiles with their green and red cubes, the translucent action pawn and even more the dice... these are my favorite dice in any game ever! I'm excited to play the game even just because of them!!!

The game-play is very good too. Just like Robinson Crusoe, I don't think that First Martian is a very puzzly cooperative game. You know what you have to do and the different possibilities to get there. What you need to figure out is how to reach your goal while dealing with so many unpredictable events. And the mechanisms are VERY strong. I'm crazy about this worker placement system, where two pawns guarantee success while one is a gamble, but it's more efficient. I also love the 3 dice system to resolve these actions. If you like mechanisms of Robinson Crusoe, you'll like First Martians too. And just like its brother, in First Marians every scenario poses different challenges and tells a different story... so the replayability is huge!

Now let's address a few criticisms that I've seen online. First the rulebook: It's not nearly as bad as people say it is. I had no problem learning the game from it. Just, it's a complex game and it takes a while to master its rule-set. You'll feel confused and lost in your first games, but it's just because there's a lot of things to remember. It gets SO MUCH better an easier after a few plays. Second, the story. This is very much depending on personal taste, but I really enjoy the hard science theme and the game succeeds at making me feel like I'm on Mars doing research and dealing with problems. I do however agree that the writing of the events could and should be better. Yet this doesn't stop me from enjoying the game.

In fact, the writing of the events is my only complaint about First Martians. The writing is not bad across the board though. There's plenty of well written and exciting events. However, there's also a lot of them that could be written in a way that the story would transpire more. Fortunately, this is all in the App... which means that this issue could easily be fixed in the future. And I do hope they will fix it.

Overall, First Martians is a game I really enjoy and one that excites me every time I come back to it. I can't wait to try the campaigns and see what Portal Games has to offer with the future updates and events. At the moment I like it a bit less than its brother Robinson Crusoe, because of the writing in some events, but it's still a great game and one that has a huge potential because of the App. I'm super glad to have First Martian in my collection: it's a fantastic design and another struck of genius from Mr. Trzewiczek! Don't believe the haters. Great game!

Two plays of 'A Guessing Game'; one loss and one win.  I enjoyed both games from go to whoah as my friend had done the hard work of sorting the rules out beforehand in a couple of solo games.  The theme came through nicely, and we picked an exploration scenario to try to bring it out all the more, but the rate of equipment failure was ludicrously high (of course, to make a game of it).

A decent resource management game. It has tension but after several plays I feel it lacks excitement. Lots of  decision making each round and always more to be done than the time or actions you have available will allow you to do. The theme isn't as strong as I would have liked and the rulebook isn't great as many have said. I have struggled through several scenarios feeling as thought I have house ruled the way a certain interaction should be played.  Oaky but not the great game I was hoping for.

Wow, wow, did I hate this game. I simply do not understand why this is considered fun. A few peeves:

1) Apps can be excellent in games to do something a player can't do. This app replaced some card decks and generated random events. Somehow, none of the complexity of the game became managed by the app? That is a wasted opportunity.

2) This game is too complex for no reason. When Rodney Smith at Watch It Played takes nearly an hour to explain it, you know something is wrong. 

3) You have such limited decisions. You take (possibly) 2 actions a turn - that have the chance to whiff. You can also get random events so you have even less actions per turn. In a 7 turn game, that means I make... 14 choices. That's it. 14 choices for what's going to be a multiple hour game.

4) Upkeep. Dear God, the upkeep in this game. There are multiple parts where you just have to follow the app instructions and update the board status. And it just goes on and on. This might have the worst ratio of upkeep to decision space I've ever seen.

5) Difficulty. Maybe some people find this fun. I do not. When a random event wipes out what I spent last turn doing (plus some!), I don't know why I'm bothering.  We lost on turn 3 and I don't know what we could have done different.

This game is a tremendous pass for me. It might have been the worst 'designer' game I've ever played.

Spot on thematically. There are some minor holes in the rules and essential mechanics; systems management may not be for everyone, but I love it. For a NASA-ESA facility that must have quadruple redundancy for all their systems design, things fail way too often (but that is needed for game excitement). App will tailor experience in the campaign, but because of the presence of the app, I only give it a 9; otherwise it would have been a 10. After playing the two campaigns, my impression dropped from 9 to 6. Essentially disappointing endings for both, unfortunately. They were a let down for me. (I so much wanted to fall in love with this game...) And, there's no other way to say this: the app does NOT deliver at all.

Like seemingly every other Portal game up to this point, the rulebook for this is a train wreck. The game play in this is overwhelmingly dull and luck plays a big role in a number of missions. There are no interesting choices, just dull, almost forced non-decisions as you simply react to events without meaningful context. The story of missions, if you can use that term, is simply not there. This game needs something to make it interesting but fails to deliver on all fronts. A number of things in this don't even make thematic sense; idiotic things like group morale goes down by 1 because you traveled through this edge of a ring "because reasons", let alone the way some events simply play out "because reasons" without any thematic or rules-based reasoning. There aren't enough green or white cubes in the box to actually track what we did in the first 2 scenarios we played, one of which was the recommended "tutorial" mission which seems insanely short-sighted: you KNEW what these missions were and how many cubes would be needed, so how could you not include enough to cover that scenario?! I really had high hopes for this one but it ended up being a massive disappointment. The grammar in the app and rules is also awful; this is a professional production - there is no excuse for this sort of thing from a big name publisher. Hire a damn proofreader. This is the last bad game from Portal that has blacklisted them from my shelves. Had a really hard time selling this game for much less than its retail price which might be a little indicative of how this game is being perceived.

I've been wondering when folks would catch on to the fact that "exploration and settlement of Mars" is a Large Unexplored Area of gaming.  Looks like it's starting, but since learning that this design requires an app, it's off my list.  I refuse to play board/electronic hybrids; if I wanted a computer-game experience, I'd play one.  Disappointing.

This is a 6-7 for the stand-alone scenarios and the promise of the campaigns. I will update once I get through at least one of the campaigns. For now, the game play feels like it would be decent at 1 player, fine at 2 players, but not worth it at 3+. This feels like a solo experience with more thought given to a co-operative mode. My biggest concern is the writing. If this game is going to have legs, it needs to show vast improvement.

The difficulty of this game's rule set is vastly overblown--especially if you start with the new almanac. A careful reading of the materials combined with a practice run of the tutorial scenario makes it quite playable. From there, you'll have to focus on how each scenario changes things, but it flows pretty well. Just enter with a mindset that you can't do something the rule book, app or scenario card doesn't positively allow. You can remove the shrink from the box and complete the first scenario within 3 hours.

The app is decent and serves as more of a guide than a way to inject theme (we'll see if this changes with the campaigns). They almost should have gone further and incorporated more of the decks into the app, as they are pretty much dice rolls in card form. Doing that would have streamlined setup and lessened table space some more, but I'm sure that would have brought other complaints about the cross-over of board games and software. Additionally, First Martians definitely feels like a game that once you're done with the content you can set it aside. Thus, its reliance on the app is perfectly fine. As of now, I have zero concerns about wanting to play this 20 years from now. 

Overall, the system works pretty well and the individual scenarios show some of the different levers that can be pulled within the system. The foundation of something interesting is there. The board and other aspects of the production do a decent job of bringing out the notion that these are astronauts stranded on Mars. But prior to the campaigns and as of October 2017, the writing of the flavor text is, to put it mildly, lacking. For one, the event text is largely descriptive and does not improve the experience. When flavor text is present, it is forgettable except for when it becomes laughable. The main emotion that comes through is one of immaturity. It feels like Mars is occupied by college freshmen instead of well-trained astronauts, and Earth's command center is a curmudgeon customer service representative. If the campaign does what it should do and/or the writing improves, this could go up. If those don't occur, this rating will go down.

It is incredible that people still give very low scoring to complain about Apps being used in a Boardgame.

This is ridiculous as the game play can be enhanced with such mechanics in a good way.
Look at the positive side of things:

1. Human errors are reduced (they happen all the time in solo games).
2. Bookkeeping is done perfectly.
3. The interaction with the board is mostly very smooth and having a tablet by the side doesn't disturb the joy/fun of the Boardgame components at all

It is time to grow up and I pity people who complain about this on forums and Facebook while they stay on these tablets all the time.

I have yet to see a modern day hybrid game that dissapointed. Descent2 with the new solo App did TRIPPLE the sales of this year long product. Mansions of Madness2 with the App revived the franchise and made it one of the hottest sellers in 2016/2017 (with a third reprint in less than a year). XCom was almost perfect as a first trial.

Oh and btw those who use the "time" element of software. I can play ALL my hybrid computer boardgames from Avalon Hill of the 1981-1983 era ... perfectly... these days on my Windows 10 machines (among them the Surface 4 tablet).

It is called emulation mode and these 35+ year old games run better than ever on modern day hardware with open system OS.

Giving low-red ratings just for the sake of using an App is an insult to the excellent game designers who make board gaming a step forward in design and ... instead of hyping about "Legacy" mechanics where you need to tear up cards and put stickers on our BEAUTIFUL boards and so destroy them, one should be pleased that in App assisted boardgames these things are handled by the computer without destroying your beloved components you invested so much money in.  Enjoy the ride !

First play was a little chaotic. The rules were not easy to decipher. The graphic design was a little jarring and confusing. It is still hard for me to play a game that is completely app dependent.

Amazon made my wife an offer she still should have refused for this game.  It's not the worst game I've ever tried to play, but it comes close.  There might even be a good game somewhere under all the incredibly fiddly pile of components.  The game feels like an early prototype with ill considered components.  The quality of the components isn't the problem, but rather an unmanageable number of moving parts preventing enjoyment of a simple game that could have been excellent with richer theme.  In our single play so far the app did nothing that couldn't have been done better by a deck of cards.

I really want to like this (I love Robinson Crusoe). But it is even more fiddly. Even with the app. And certain decisions seem so counter intuitive or arbitrary that they are difficult to keep track of (like the two different ways that oxygen and food are used with the supply tracker). And the rulebook is another disaster. I'm hoping that once I get immersed in the campaign that will make up for the shortcomings

I have never played Robinson Crusoe so I cannot compare the two but Frist Martians looks great on the table and takes up a lot of space! Most of the components looks great but we had some issues with the amount of cubes included; we ran out of green cubes very early in our scenario. I've heard the campaign is great so I may have the rating later but I was really underwhelmed by the scenario we played. I feel we used the one action over 50% of the time so it became really repetitive. The rulebook is confusing too. I did like the app a lot to keep track of everything, similar to Ma soins of Madness. Definitely not impressed by the single scenario but willing to give the campaign a shot.

RATING: 6
I waffle on this one. There are genuinely excellent elements, and I really dig the explorations and system basics. The app works pretty well in its current state the Almanac rules revision does its job pretty well. I think the scenarios and the creative breadth there (similar to Robinson Crusoe) really is wonderful and one of the best parts of the system.

But, this game is heavy and can be a bear to fully grok. It's very clinical and procedural in constantly maintaining systems and the churn of functional degradation serves as an action waster as you try to do what you need to do to progress in the mission. This works, but it's not always the most fun.

It definitely does feel more scientific than Robinson Crusoe, partially due to the maintenance aspect as it's more rigid in its systems.

All in all, I think this is a decent game that does some great things, but it also has a host of attributes which keep me from loving it.

Our game group likes legacy games, so we tried this one out. Unfortunately, the gameplay was difficult/frustrating, and the legacy part of this game felt like it was sort of tacked on as an afterthought. It didn't really feel like that was playtested; there were lots of questions about mechanics and it was overall sort of frustrating to work so hard and get a lot of work abandoned.
That said, maybe the game wasn't meant to be played legacy-style (despite having that), and the regular play could be okay.

RATING: 8
This game is infuriatingly difficult to learn. I have tried 3 times now and have so many questions that cannot be answered by the book, and as far as I can tell, there is no one to tweet while you play if you have questions. I honestly don't know how so many people are able to figure this one out. I can teach games like Scythe and Agricola and other intensive worker-placement games, so it's not like I'm going from Monopoly to this. But I'm really scratching my head here. I watched the watch it played video I read the directions thoroughly. There is just a lot of confusion and I don't think they play tested the rulebook as well as they could have with people who maybe don't grasp their Concepts or who have never played that game that this was based upon. And it was not a cheap game! I'm sweating at the money I'm going to lose when I try to sell this.

The app is great, and really helps, but I wish you'd just had a few more step-by-step sections. I don't know, I'm sure it's all there and I just haven't found the answers I am looking for. But I think that's a problem, too.

I will also say that setup is a bit ridiculous. There are about a hundred little tiny blocks that I have to keep track of on this board now. One false move by my cat and it's just Doom. There must be a better way!

A game thats made for the sake of putting out a game for portal games. This is a DUMB game disguised with tons of rules and app integration. Game mechanics feel forced to justify theme but not necessarily enjoyable. I can say the same thing with robinson crusoe. Ignacy has great ideas for theme but cannot translate his ideas into a game that really works. Overrated designer.

NOTE: I HAVE THE PRE-ORDER VERSION.
This game creates an engaging puzzle/adventure that forces you to prioritize immediate dangers and impending issues to reach a goal before disaster strikes. If you are into hard sci-fi over horror, then this will be the game to pick over Mansions of Madness. The narrative and ambiance is still stronger with MoM, but First Martians is an amazing hybrid that fits the theme and makes perfect (thematically, anyway) use of app assistance. 
The game really shines in Campaign mode, as does the app, which lets you record ALL tokens and tiles on the board so you can put the game away in the middle of a campaign without losing track of ANYTHING.

So - I think my least favorite part of BGG is when it causes me to follow the groupthink. 

I read SO much negative about this and the rulebook that I just ignored it for months.  I finally bought it when the price was too attractive to ignore, and lo and behold, I love it. 

It’s relentless and it’s hard, and you’re hanging on for dear life, but it works. It totally gives me the vibe of running a creaky complaining space station with no staff. You know what it feels like?  It feels like someone who loves science fiction wrote “a board game using the real science of the early days of interplanetary travel” - in that science fiction timeline. 

I like it a lot. I like it as much as Nemo’s War. I’m angry that I followed the herd on this one. It doesn’t deserve the whining and loaning it’s getting. I had no trouble learning from the rulebook and watching some videos. 

I hope it picks up steam and sells well. It’s worth it.

Great theme and app integration. 

In the end, the randomness of both malfunctions and actions served to make the game feel less like a system to work against and more like a bunch of frustrating chaos. This took us out of the game. I'm sure that frustrating chaos is what it would feel like on Mars, but I'm no astronaut and from my table it is not life and death. We felt very similar things about Robinson Crusoe, though we gave that a longer leash.

RATING: 5
Played 2x when it first came out. The game is ok. It didn't do a lot of the things I liked about Robinson Crusoe, which is fine, just not my preference. For instance, in Robinson, you generally start with nothing and have to build tools you need to survive. In First Martians, you generally start with everything working and things break down over time. Watching your camp slowly improve is more fun to me than watching your Mars base slowly (or quickly!) degrade. 

(As a sidenote: I like the *idea* behind the mechanics--your Mars base is  a series of closed systems that affect each other, so one critical malfunction can cause things to spiral out of control. I'm a big fan of Kim Stanley Robinson sci-fi books that explore these kinds of systems, so they are definitely fun to read about, maybe not so much to actually play...)

I also thought the app was clunky and didn't add fun to the game. I hear it's been improved since when the game first came out though. 

Finally, I never tried out the campaign, which is probably where the meat of this game lies. Basically, I have too many campaign games already (haven't even started Voyage of the Beagle) so ultimately this game did not find a spot in my collection.

I have to admit, the game is actually fun both in theme and mechanics.  However, the complexity of the game, combined with the poorly designed instructions, and the app (which I really don't mind), have caused me from maybe a 8-9 rating to a 5.  I would suggest waiting until they work out the mechanics of the game and instructions a little more before buying.  

BTW: I have about 5 games under my belt and have not played RC.  I have heard that they are similar in game rules/functionality so those who like RC may be able to easily adapt to this game.  I am also a very avid gamer and typically don't have a hard time with picking up new games.  This one took me about 2 hours to read through the instructions and a run through of "Watch It Played" to pick it up.  Some details covered in the video are not detailed in the instructions (grrrrrrrrr).

Best wishes to anyone who plays.  Like I said, I like the game...but it needs some more work for me to improve my rating.

Ignacy  is a sadist and apparently  I am a masochist.  I wish the rules were a bit clearer, and that there were a few more cubes, but this hit my top ten.  After I do the campaign  I may ammendment this, but this theme is spot on.  I was on an aircraft carrier for 3 years, and being in the middle of the ocean short on replacement parts, dealing with the same people, day in and day out.  This brings back those feelings.  We had to decide which systems were canabalized to get others running.  We all had our own quiet places.  Even on super sized ships, things were stark, functional not pretty, crowded, and stressful.  Bravo Ignacy, a job very well done

This was one of the worst games that I've ever played.  It felt incredibly mechanical. From my reading, this may have been because the initial scenario we played was designed because Robinson Crusoe's rule book was so atrocious that the designers felt the need to create a walk through scenario.  I don't know.  If that was the case, then I suspect just creating a better rule book may have been a more appropriate solution.  I can find redeeming qualities in almost any game that I play.  I was looking forward to First Martians and was very disappointed.  In a nutshell, this game not only lacked fun, it also attempted to suck all enjoyment out of its players like a board game vampire.  I give it a 2 because of what it could have been and because the person who tried to teach us how to play started our Gen Con experience by arriving 15 minutes late and saying "I hate cons" upon arrival.

RATING: 5
This game has a lot of issues. And most of them haven't been fixed from its predecessor, Robinson Crusoe. I can enjoy RC with the right group, although the game has problems as big as the gorilla that almost killed us all.
 The big issue I have with FM is that it does nothing to address the issues in RC, and just bolts on more of its own. Unsatisfying action resolutions, alpha players, lots going on across the board, and bulks of new rules each scenario- all these issues are amplified. The thing that made RC so enjoyable, the haunting story cards, are stripped into an app, with writing about as descriptive as a nutrition guide. ...When will that event pop back up? I would honestly have no clue if it did, because the writing is bare, disjointed, and fed to me via a screen. The companion app can keep track of things a deck of cards can't, easily, but it does a bad job at what it tries to do and the rules still ask you to print things out from Portal Games' website - a thing a companion app should be there to remove the need of. The app doesn't manage enough to be very interesting, and it bodges what it does. The scenarios take 20 minutes to learn the rules to, the game takes longer to set up than Star Wars: Rebellion, and it's mostly a drudge. I love the ideas in this game, and the presentation is fabulous, but the mechanics are about as deep and engaging and functional as a hole punch. But hey, maybe you really like trying to hole punch really difficult pieces of paper - if so, the puzzle this game offers is for you.

Having started the campaign, I feel a lot more invested, and can enjoy better the struggle with the thought of future consequence looming overhead. The non-campaign scenarios deal with minor parts of the broad scope of mechanics, which makes all the things you don't need to do a mystifying, haunting presence. Now, because of the campaign setting, every action you take makes you think about the action you're not taking now but will need to take later... The thought of needing to survive next week makes the game much more involved. Unfortunately, the storytelling is still like watching a bomb go off in a bunker from outside. The story being the bomb, and the rules being the metre-thick concrete walls. You feel as though story has impacted what you do in some way, but fortunately the rules didn't let more than a slight tremor hit you. 
Still, there's definitely more enjoyment in a campaign if you can get that far.

Built on the core of the awardwinning Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island, First Martians: Adventures on the Red Planet pits players against the hostile Martian environment and a whole host of new adventures and challenges.The immersion experience is further enhanced with an integrated app that maintains the balance and challenge throughout. Players have the option of taking on the design as a series of seperate games, in a custom campaign mode (like in Legacy games) in which each successive game builds on the last, or even an Open World mode in which they are free to roam about the Martian surface and explore for as long as they can survive.

I picked it up two days ago and have already played it 6 times, so that probably gives a good idea of its initial impressions on me.

I still haven't figured out if I like it better than Robinson Crusoe yet.  I generally like the hard science Martian theme more than the deserted island theme, but I also tend to like "build things up" games better than "Stop things from falling apart" games, and First Martians sits mostly in the latter category.

With all the negative feedback about the rules, I think I overprepared with watching videos, etc., before I sat down and played my first game.  I found the rulebook perfectly usable (just don't assume anything unless the rulebook says it and you should do all right), and had little issues with learning the game.

Please note that 90% of the negative reviews out there come from either not liking apps in general, or having trouble learning the rules.  There are a lot of resources out there now to help learn the rules, and once you get beyond that, there's an excellent game here.

RATING: N/A
Based on the strength of Robinson Crusoe plus the theme, this would have been a must-buy for me—without the app. However, I simply won't consider it with an app. As you can read below, I am highly skeptical of boardgame/app crossovers both because of design considerations as well as structural business model incompatibilities that limit the longevity and stability of the product.

TL;DR: Boardgame design is a discipline sharply circumscribed by the cardboard medium, which is precisely what makes it unique and notable. Furthermore, bits rot, but cardboard is forever. Technology must be fed or it becomes obsolete, usually far faster than predicted. Both of these risks undermine the goal of making great games.

IMHO, running a game on wetware in meatspace is the primary constraint on boardgames that make them interesting versus the vast richness of video games. It is precisely because they are stripped down to human scale that they are notable. Design decisions are different and generally less well-considered when you have the resources of a computer to throw at the problem. 

I believe that boardgames are objectively better games than most video games precisely because of the inherent limitations of the medium. Of course, an app like the one included in this game is not a full video game. But the injection of technology into a game design allows much of the open-ended design sloppiness that is endemic in the video game industry. I can see why the ability to innovate is attractive to some game designers, but it also brings with it all the ills of unconstrained creativity.

But how could *less* creativity be a bad thing? Well, recall the Star Wars prequels, which are widely considered a debacle. Many critics, myself included, believe the failure was that George Lucas could put anything he imagined on the screen using technology. And he did. Yet all of his ideas were not great ideas; a lower barrier to creation allowed the lesser elements of his vision that should have been winnowed away to persist.

I draw this analogy because apps let game designers do something similar with their boardgame designs. Unfortunately, when anything can be done, it often is. Yet it is the careful, ruthless curation of ideas that makes a design great.

The fact that the cardboard medium constrains design decisions is a benefit to gamers, as well as a limitation on designers that can sometimes feel suffocating when they have an ambitious idea. Unfortunately, as with any creative discipline, it's easier to have ambitious ideas that are weak than those that are strong. Good design is the process of eliminating the weak ideas, leaving only the best. Technology is a double-edged tool that can allow weak ideas to thrive in the hands of a poor designer. Cardboard, by contrast, is less forgiving, to everyone's benefit.

I'd go so far as to say that if a game is complex enough that it requires a computer as a prosthesis, then it is by definition lacking as a boardgame. Instead, if the design really requires it, make an awesome video/mobile game—it will sell far more copies as an app than it ever would as a boardgame.

Turning to more pragmatic matters, even if you don't care about the design aspect of using an app in a game, there is the topic of longevity and the impact of technology. In short, it costs a lot to maintain an app. New OS versions, new technologies, new UI conventions, new hardware form factors, changing audience behavior, demographic shifts, backend services, data collection, security patches, localization, and more make technology extremely volatile; no field has advanced more or changed more quickly in human history. Unless you're prepared for that, it's going to bite you.

Especially from a smaller publisher, there simply won't be the resources or financial incentives to maintain the app over time. Even bonafide boardgame hits sell just a few tens of thousands of copies over their published lifetime. Even if this game were amazing, in 3-5 years this game won't sell enough copies (if it's still in print) to pay anyone to maintain the app, and any profits from prior sales will be long gone. It will become just another financial albatross around the neck of a small company, and one for which there will be dwindling business incentive to support.

Having been in technology my entire career, I feel like the designers who are making the decision to use apps in their games are novices at understanding the implications of that decision. They see only the upside of expanded possibilities and fewer constraints. Yet practitioners in the software field have heard and understand that the vast majority of the cost of software lies not in initial development, but in its maintenance. (This is even more true when targeting closed platforms like mobile OSs instead of open standards like the Web.) Thus, it's naive to think that changing technology won't have a major impact on any game that incorporates it, and ultimately limit its longevity to the attention span and financial wherewithal of the publisher.

Remember, app (and boardgame) publishers don't make a dime when they upgrade or maintain an existing app. From a business standpoint, adding technology to a boardgame adds an external risk that in 100% of cases will require spending money at a future date. Boardgame publishers are simply not structured to operate this kind of business model, and their cash reserves are usually low and very periodic.

In effect, a publisher supporting an app receives an unexpected "invoice" every time a vendor releases a new version of the OS because potentially breaking changes or changing conventions require app updates. When this happens, every business will weigh the returns of honoring that "invoice" before they decide whether or not to pay it. Unfortunately, customer satisfaction and goodwill are generally lower priority than paying employees or releasing new products that generate more tangible returns. Simply put, the business incentives are just not there for boardgame publishers to support this business model.

However, while I disagree with the judgement, I think it is understandable that boardgame publishers and designers could analogize with video gamers who are happy to spend money on a console or PC game with a known limited lifespan. Why couldn't the same be true for boardgamers? They will play the game for awhile, then move on to new things (and we do, admittedly). If it does well, in half a generation, the game can be remade or the license revived to sell more of the same to nostalgic customers without too much concern for maintenance costs.

What I don't think they consider, though, is the enormous amount of money spent in the video game industry on backward compatibility and the lifespan of gaming technology platforms. For example, consoles are embedded hardware that never changes. Sony plans a 10-year lifespan for PlayStation, and by that time, standards have moved so far that playing older games becomes a niche market.

But the mobile OS platforms are not nearly as stable, nor is their casual usage pattern a driver for OS vendors to maintain backward compatibility. In fact, OS vendors thrive on frequent updates to apps and platforms to continue to drive engagement and sales.

Just think: 3 years ago (2014), iPhone 5 and Android Lollipop were being released. How many mobile apps do you use from then, or from 9 years ago (2008) when the first app store was opened? And how many apps have stopped working because their developers simply stopped updating them as the OS changed beneath them? Ever open an app that hasn't been updated in awhile and been repulsed by the aging look and feel or outdated UI conventions?

Keep in mind that Agricola came out "just" 10 years ago, before the invention of smart phones. Catan came out 22 years ago, long before most people even had a personal computer, much less a tablet or mobile phone. Imagine such a game today, if it required an app?

Maybe in 10 years time, no one will care about this game; after all, it's no Agricola or Catan. But it would be nice to have the option to play it, or sell it to someone who could. And I'd say if you're a designer looking to craft a great game, shoot for immortality—planned obsolescence isn't something you should allow to taint your thinking.

I'm confident that eventually publishers will learn that the costs of building and maintaining apps is not worth the perceived short-term benefits. And I hope that gamers are savvy enough not to fall for a business model that relies on constant remakes or rereleases to stay relevant. There is a tremendous business advantage in a self-contained product that can be printed, warehoused indefinitely, and sold without any external dependencies or future costs. But I fear we'll have to suffer through a generation of obsolete apps and wasted designs before that realization hits home.

I suspect the low opinions come primarily from either people who didn't really know what to expect (haven't played RC) or people who expected the app to do more of the rules' heavy lifting (it's more of an easier-to-patch errata monitor than helpful app).

That being said, the game does involve lots of upkeep and vigilance and isn't for the faint of heart. (Like Robinson, I intend to play this solo exclusively.) I do enjoy the game, though, and look forward to exploring what it has to offer.

FM is an excellent game with an interesting theme that tells an plausible story as it unfolds.  The rule book is a bit difficult to follow due to its organization, but stick with it and you’ll be rewarded with a good experience. We made a few mistakes during our first play, but that only challenged me to dig a bit deeper for my next game.

First impression: Even as an experienced Robinson Crusoe player, the first play through of FM was bewildering, to say the least. It comes across as solid, with a number of interesting choices along the way. RC seems more... atmospheric, I guess, and the much-touted app has potential, but for now the flavour text is so brief that it doesn't really convey much beyond "Something is broken" or "Another storm is coming".

RATING: 3
Thank you, First Martians, for finally giving me the clarity to swear off Portal's games for good. At their very best, their designs have been some combination of kludgy and/or unsatisfying--making their vaunted claims of narrative absurd on their face.
And this is Portal at their worst. Playing whack-a-mole with failing systems is utterly unengaging, and the horrific excuse for a rulebook and the wildly inconsistent iconography fight you every step of the way. I don't object to the app in and of itself, but it fails to improve much on a deck of event cards. All the added upkeep of the modular scenario structure isn't going to help if the core gameplay is dull and tedious.
Two final insults that the game subjects you to: -The game doesn't come with enough components to play the first scenario. It's missing green cubes. Come on, seriously?
-The app will devour your battery alive.

Maybe I need more plays, but I struggle to bring myself to play this one.  I was really excited at the prospect of Robinson Crusoe on Mars.  However, it doesn't have the same sense of adventure as Robinson Crusoe.  It feels more like a logic puzzle with lots of rules that plays best solo.  Not a good spot for a game I expected to be thematic and amazing for a small group.  Portal has tried to improve things with the Almanac (which is great).  I enjoyed the early launch mission (Removal) but never managed to beat it before it was removed from the game.  The removal of that mission sort of removed my desire to play the game.  I will update my rating/comment if I find the desire to play the campaign.

First impressions (2 scenarios played): Solid co-op worker placement, resource management game.
However, I think Robinson Crusoe is the more interesting game. Martians has less flavorful events than Robinson Crusoe (75% are basically "something broke, fix it"). The scenarios seem to be more scripted. Gone are the "tool"-cards and they aren't really replaced by anything comparable and as fundamental for game play. Seems like Martians has a smaller decision space and less interesting story. This comes at the benefit of the app handling events and their consequences if not managed. First Martians seems to play faster, which is the result of a lighter rule-set. Hopefully they campaign scenarios can compensate for the less interesting game play and story that the stand-alone scenarios has.

Beautiful Components but boring play.  There are no decisions in this game.  The scenario/app/board presents problems with a linear and obvious line of play.

If you liked Robinson Crusoe you will like this. While many of it's mechanisms are similar to RC the overall game is quite different. You are not scrounging for food and to build a habitat, you already have them. In fact you have the power and oxygen you need to survive. But you need to keep them running while completing your mission tasks. The HUB is constantly breaking and you need to keep your systems running long enough to survive. Great game!

I did the preorder of FM, and although I like the game and what it brings to the table, I feel that Ignacy made a few  mistakes on productions that shouldn't be present for a company with the trajectory of Portal: 1) back colour of Malfunction cards, orange and red in my copy are almost the same, 2) colour-blind people will have a really hard time with this game for some choices between red and green, 3) I understand the idea of having a same-ish colour in the board, but the facilities may have been colour coded with the Malfunction cards, 4) probably the rulebook should have been made available earlier, because it has some of the same problems as Robinson Crusoe (that been said, Ignacy did an awesome job replying all our questions on this forum).

Disappointed with it, did not live up to my expectations as a successor to Robinson Crusoe.  Feels like it was rushed to production without enough cleaning up the rulebook, board, and app.  Especially bothered by the poor grammar after asking Ignacy during development to ensure that the English translations were done well.

Soo bad game. Don't waste your time for playing it! Play 51 State, Imperial Settlers or Robinson Crusoe Ignacy's real gems!

RATING: 6
For some reason First Martians just feels a little lackluster for me. In Robinson Crusoe you have the sense of actually building and crafting things while exploring the island foraging for food and building materials. This one just felt like I'm just patching leaky space hubs. You do an action and the hub starts falling apart which doesn't make a lot of sense. The first scenario also felt less challenging than RC's introductory scenario. Need to play more to give it a more accurate scoring but I think Ignacy's games just doesn't suit my gaming taste.

Played solo. I like the theme, and found the game relatively easily to learn. The rule book is good at explaining the mechanics, no complaints. It does follow a lot of the Robinson Crusoe mechanics. I somewhat prefer Robinson Crusoe in the sense of adventure and survival, but like this one as well and am happy I picked it up. My only complaint is thematic, that any competent engineer would actually design such a station is a bit comical. The game design is such that something on the station is constantly breaking down, and there is no redundancy to counter negative events. Thematically, this is pretty ridiculous. One needs to pretend there has already been a series of unfortunate events leading up to each scenario (e.g. The Martian movie type deal), and then this design decision makes more sense, but it's still a stretch, and the app and rulebook do not do anything to call this out in the starting mission. Overall a fun game, though theme is a bit wonky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So much potential, so many great possibilities and opportunities. So many mistakes. 

The rulebook isn't just bad, it will be a blight to Portal Games' reputation. Shame on Portal for accepting and distributing this level of quality control in their products. I would have much rather seen a delay in the game with a complete and well written rulebook than to be left stumbling and unsure of the questions asked. Leaving a paper in the box with an email address for rules questions is not enough. Both the rulebook and the app are full of spelling errors, and opaque language. The rulebook is entirely unsatisfactory for rule explanation. Familiarity with Robinson Crusoe is not enough.

In regards to the amount of upkeep to maintain the state of the board, First Martians doesn't make any significant improvements. The few strides and improvements it does make is offset by simply under-delivering with the required number of components. We found ourselves immediately running out of red, white and green cubes in our plays, making the board turn into a hodgepodge of colors.

I know many complain about apps, but I found it more than capable and enjoyable to use. it isn't complicated to use and it utilizes the strengths of electronic devices, with built in FAQ, obfuscating information, and utilizing memory use out of memory. However, I did find the battery usage of the app to be absolutely brutal, with my phone, which normally lasts a day and a half with moderate use, to being unable to a manage single game starting at 75% battery life. My phone died in round 6 if the first game. Optimization could help out here.

I will continue to play this game, because there is a fun experience to be found in the marred game. But its sins and flaws should not be ignored or glossed over.

Not quite the Robinson Crusoe on mars I was promised, but an excellent game in the same vein. Loses half a point for making a mandatory app which is not really required (the app would be great if it was optional, but it's mandatory). The crisis are different but the overall system is the same. The game is also possibly the most bang for buck I've ever seen in a box. 6 scenarios which are very replayable, a 5 mission campaign and a legacy campaign complete with sealed envelopes. Ignacy and crew have really outdone themselves this time.

The scifi theme on this is a lot of fun, but I feel the game lumbers under its own weight. The rules are obtuse and difficult to remember, sending me searching through the manual throughout the game. The designer answers posted questions quickly, which helps, and when everything comes together it is a tense, fun game of cooperation.
I haven't tried the campaign yet, which is supposed to be game changing.

Robinson na marsie. Baza w rozsypce a kosmici przyjdą na obiad ;) Trzeba dbać o prąd, powietrze, zapasy, laboratoria i dobre samopoczucie załogi i jednocześnie wykonywać misje. Można będzie ustawić poziom trudności by ludziska nie chcieli zlinczować autora po pierwszej partii. 6 niezależnych misji + jedna kampania złożona z kilku (5?) misji wzajemnie powiązanych + jedna kampania typu legacy (jednorazowa) również z kilku(5?) misji. Zamiast kart przygód aplikacja. Aplikacja w kampaniach ma kilka istotnych błędów związanych z jej działaniem jak i fabułą (17.08.2017). Podobno mają być poprawki - zapewne tylko do działania. W pojedynczych scenariuszach więcej walki z techniką niż przygody. Kampania pierwsza podobno z mało ekscytującym i przewidywalnym zakończeniem. 
23.10.2017 Jedna z misji (2?) nie jest możliwa do wygrania na dwóch graczy, nawet jeżeli wszystkie rzuty kością będą udane - nie wiem, słyszałem ;) Chyba jednak lepiej poczekać aż wyjdzie nowsza (poprawiona) edycja. Jak nie wyjdzie to znaczy że jednak nie taki sukces straszny jak go Ignacy maluje ;)

RATING: 6.5
This is actually a rating of 8 with some deductions.

Minus 1, because Portal used the first 3000 early backers as blind-playtesters. The amount of questions, ambiguities, errors that came up in the first 48 hours could have easily been discoreverd during a short period of blind playtesting. Not very professional (...and I´m talking about obvious stuff, not edge cases).

Minus 0.5, because from a game of that price point I expect to have enough components in it to play at least the 6 basic scenarions. Needing to use cubes from other games to have enough for some scenarios is ridiculous. And standard cubes are not that high of a production cost.

Other than that, enjoying the game and looking forward to play more.

Game's biggest downfall is the ratio between playing the game (making interesting choices) and fiddling around with upkeep (managing the AI part). I feel more like a cog in a huge machine rather than a player actively making tough choices. Rules to complexity ratio is off for me. Instead of making an interesting playing field for the players, the rules mostly cover the sprawling AI which defines the game overshadowing the players and their actions.

[b]3: Poor game. Will strongly resist playing.[/b]
I very excited about this game, even considered pre-ordering but decided against it. Fairly glad I didn't. A friend of mine let me borrow it. Reading the rules, I thought things would be fine, that is, until I got it on the table. 

Just a ton of back and forth between the rules and the game. Hard to understand, any immersion I had was stripped away when I had to check the rule book. 

Ultimately, for me, wanting to play this solo, this is a no go, I have zero problems with the idea of having the app in a board game, I like it actually, it adds/drives a good bit of story. Sadly given how poor the rules are, how little flow there is to the actual game, checking the app was just yet another thing that stripped my attention from the board. If I wasn't having to check the rule book near constantly then I don't think looking at the app would have been as big of a deal. 

This came down to the question after 4 plays, of "Once I finally learned the game, would I be able to shelve it, play other things, and then pick it back up easily?" For me that answer is no, I don't think I would retain much of anything. Beyond that, there's just not much to the game in terms of things to do. You're mainly just reacting to things breaking or building/growing things of your own. Don't get me wrong, I get it, it fits the theme, it's just very dry. 

There's a story in the game, but its buried very deep in rules questions, second guessing yourself, and muddle. :(

Based on several two-astronaut solo playthroughs of the 'Make Yourself at Home' and lauch event 'Removal' missions. The game provides a solid challenge and the events can be quite thematical. Especially when you have to guess what may happen if you do not deal with them. 

Basically you're trying to solve an optimalization puzzle with very limited resources. It may very well be that RC does a better job of hiding the puzzle behind the theme, but overall FM feels solid. 

The rules were quite difficult to learn especially when new rules/effects come into play for different missions.. the later provided online almanac does, for me, a better job to explain the nuances in the rules. I prefer that style above the original manual.

I can not yet put a verdict on the campaign since I have not played it. This is mainly because I want to be absolute sure not to make any (rule) mistakes which might break the (legacy?) elements of the campaign..

I still do get frustrated with FM, just like with RC and This War of Mine, when I feel I have made the best possible decisions and still lose by a stroke of bad luck.

I was excited to get this game and then was faced with another shit awful rule book from Ignacy who when asked about this very same thing said 'all the rules are in the book so the rule books fine'. I'm done with his games and wasting hours trying to decipher rules and search online for FAQs because this designer is so arrogant and flippant as to not care. A 1 is appropriate as even the best ga,e ever made isn't any good if you can't learn it or are faced with hours of miserable rules deciphering. Where's the fun experience then? Lost £20 on the resale of this and will never buy one of his games again.

This could easily be a 10. I adore this game after just two plays of the most basic scenario!

Update: Played several more times and started a campaign. Solid 9. Great great game.

Updated to an 8. Can't get it to the table often. The story-telling and mechanisms are very good, but nothing compared to something like Pandemic: Legacy. Not enough to get us excited about setting up and continuing our campaign. *Certainly* not enough to get us excited about setting up for a single scenario. I'm a bit disappointed, just because I expected to adore this game for a long time to come.

Adding a 10 to offset the immature 1-3 ratings as well. Not fair to the designer to give poor ratings without even playing the game. The dislike/fear of using an app is not a valid excuse to bash on the designer for trying something different to enhance the gameplay. If you don't like it, walk away.

Like many games from Portal, especially first editions, First Martians is a mess. The board looks like a series of tracks that the app tells you to manipulate and move around depending on what happens, while the app itself tells you the "fun" stuff, such as events and the like. As a result, you feel more like an accountant than a player in a game. 

Games that use apps should be WAY more streamlined than this, especially considering how long this was in development for. Between Seafall and this, I don't know how much I trust these games that have been in development for years. There definitely seems to have been an urgency to rush both games out, and they have each suffered as a result.

I wasn't that big of a fan of Robinson Crusoe, but I can see how some would enjoy it. There's definitely an interesting experience there. I don't see how anyone can enjoy First Martians as much. They stripped what little fun they could out of RC, and threw in an app to replace the deck of events. Granted I didn't play the campaign, which has the potential to be more interesting, but again, the lack of fun factor keeps me from wanting to.

Quite disappointing overall. Portal should have taken lessons from Fantasy Flight, and what they did with the second edition of Mansions of Madness. That game gave you far more freedom to the decisions you make. Here it feels like you're in a straight jacket. The worker placement phase from RC is largely the same here, but otherwise this feels like a very on-rails, bookkeeping exercise.

I liked how the game captures the atmosphere of isolation. All these low ratings are a showing of the success in setting up the atmosphere. Maintaining systems is a meticulous, repetitive, and often drab experience.  The misunderstanding of the rules is just the same mistake my group got into when we first played RC. Played the intro mission twice and I don't see how this is fiddly at all.

Comparing this to my favorite goat isn’t fair but yet I’m doing it. 
Solo it’s not even half as good as Robinson. Multiplayer can be fun but most missions are pretty dry. The story in the campaign is not very strong. The theme is there but mostly it’s to random without making sense.
All the extra rules per scenario are a pain in the butt. I wish I could like this more, but I don’t. I will be playing the extra scenarios that are promised to come, other than that, this won’t probably hit the table much.

Excellent game system with tons to do. This game will keep you entertained for months. Incredibly finnicy with lots of things to keep track of in true Ignacy fashion, but a great game.  Everyone goes on about the rule book.  I snapped the first edition in 2 games and really did not have a problem with it.  With that said, the game was just not up my alley and I sold it.

規則:
*遊戲可進行戰役模式或是個別任務模式，指定回合內完成主要目標就過關，且有人死亡就失敗
*腳色每個技能每輪只能使用一次(放黑色方塊表示用過，如果是卡牌就翻面)，戰役模式要額外花研究行動獲得額外的腳色技能(個別模式三張技能卡一開始都有)，當一個樣本到達發現階段每個腳色都獲得一個自選的技能卡，且能馬上使用

1.事件階段  根據APP指示將一個失控軌上升一格再根據APP結算事件
2.士氣階段  起始標記玩家根據目前士氣軌拿或棄士氣標記，不夠棄每個扣一血
3.生產階段
>加總能量跟氧氣白色方塊旁數值，扣除所有設施有對應需求標記的數量，如果有剩，除二後(向上取整)加到上方的供應區，不夠則要隨機放對應的缺氧或缺電版塊到你選的設施上，一個設施上限各1，有缺X版塊的設施不再受事件卡影響，且生產階段都要加二壓力，直到被處理完
>農場的右邊生長軌一起向上推一格，第六的移到左邊對應黑色格旁的空格，然後根據左邊有幾個白色產幾個食物，然後每個人吃一個，不夠吃得少一血，超過的一樣一半紀錄到上方區

*行動階段可以放一個行動圓片到關閉版塊上，把他翻面獲得獎勵後移除，在所有行動結算完後做
4.行動階段 所有玩家同時決定要怎麼行動，放置行動圓片到對應的行動點(多個玩家可一起，都迭起，最上方為主要結算者)，之後再根據行動結算順位結算所有行動，AOM配件可以獨自行動，由使用的玩家拿走該卡代表之，Rover一定要有玩家操作，一個行動一台，可以多個玩家跟一台，Froggy探索多兩行動點，Scorpio只要在hub外的行動多一點(探索蒐集研究建造)，使用完放回倉庫，如果行動需要資源，則放工人時就調整，失敗不會回來，配件則失敗會回手，結算完行動時圓片就回手

>實驗室(研究 種植) 只用一個行動圓片丟藍骰，成功時，第一次檢驗樣本時從貨物艙移動到研究軌的第一格，之後則都是右移一格，三軌用完可再放下面，理論上可研發樣本數不限，種植行動需求一樣，成功就放一個白色方塊到農場的左下1格(一輪一次)，種植區的上限等於右方黑色方塊旁的空格
>工作艙  一個行動圓片需要丟棕色骰，成功時修理設備可拿花備用設備，把紅色換成綠色，或用其他設備的綠色跟他紅色對調
*獲得升級卡時可棄掉改拿備用設備也可以不花行動直接被一個設備的綠方塊被紅色，來獲得對應的備用設備，修理機器成功士棄掉損壞標記，升級成功時，棄掉卡片放對應方塊在對應設施上
*不屬於上面的行動在上面行動全部結算完後執行
5.失控階段 根據任務表選擇要丟的失控骰，如果該區方塊為紅色也要丟，上中下三區，根據設備紅色方塊的懲罰標記跟骰面來增加對應的失控軌格數，每一軌只要到達或超過5就抽一張對應的失控卡結算，然後重置為0，並把下方區的方塊換成紅色(最下方會影響最上方)
*如果抽失控卡跟要結算的關鍵字不同，則棄掉繼續抽直到相同
6.清理階段 設備區棄掉所有!上的標記，並把>>上的移動到!區，把所有貨物艙等待區的移動到可用趨，升級版塊就放到對應的設備上，白色方塊回到第一階段位置，人物卡上標記使用技能的方塊棄掉，起始玩家左傳，回合標記右移一格，並按APP一下
*玩家在完成主要任務時勝利，如果有限制值則要比他低或等於，其他狀況都失敗
*1~3人時起始就有自動掃描升級(對應卡棄掉)，三人時每個任務可以選一個AOM使用，兩人時每個任務選兩個AOM使用，單人時使用兩個太空人，所有AOM可使用，但一輪最多兩個
FAQ:
*除了要求多行動圓片的標記外，其他效果不疊加，關閉的設施也不能升級
*有勾骰標記的位置，一行動圓片結算時照樣丟骰不變，兩行動圓片時要丟成功骰一次

Wow, this game is a milestone that got three awards from me.  1.  Top 10 worst game ever played,  2.  Most frustrating non game game ever played,  3.  First game I have ever dumped in the trash.  After 7 attempts at this boring puzzle box I was going to sell it but do not want to do anyone the injustice of having this game.   

A bad thing ( not really even a game),  Feel ripped off.  Not buying portal games after this until played thoroughly before.   What a dissappointment and waste of money.  I am not regretting the fact that I threw it away.   Warned my two local gamestores not to stock this.

I really wanted to like this game.  The hype was tremendous, and the concept seemed awesome.  Upon receiving the game, it looked beautiful.  

Since the gameplay was modeled on Robinson Crusoe, I expected the game to be an easy learn, and I jumped in on the first scenario.  After half a dozen false starts, I am done for now.  I didn't even get to a campaign.  Maybe I will try again in a few months.  What are my issues?

1) Lack of clear explanations and directions in the rules.  

2) I expected the app to provide guidance to the game play, but no, the app handles some things and ignores others.  

3) Extraneous crap.  The malfunction box? The player profiles? 

In Robinson Crusoe, it worked for me to start with no determination tokens, as they have been shipwrecked and are happy to be alive.  But not here.  At the start of the game I am fresh, and on top of my game... but I can't use any of my skills until I start screwing up?

Unclear rules, poor design (colours etc.). No immersion at all. Worst companion app I have seen, with typos and mismatches between description, visual representation and manual. Setup time exceeding play time. Played 6 times single scenarios, tried first campaign but couldn't bear the pain of both: looking at the game and trying to get through unclear mechanics. I honestly feel cheated by publisher and author each time this game gets to the table.

Wow - the app and the game almost seem to have been developed completely independently. This game makes zero sense. So much not covered by rules,  so many keywords and icons, fiddy rules - all of them siphoning away any chance of fun. Plus the app misses every possible opportunity to help the player get to grips with things. I actually found this unplayable. (I am familiar with Robinson Crusoe BTW). Such a shame and I think these problems are going to sink what could have been a super game.

Update is: I watched a full hour how to play video. Spent another 3 hours setting up, learning rules. I understand more about how to play but like the game a lot less. Too much book keeping. You don't so much play as go through the rules. I still have to search & go online, etc etc every 3 minutes.

The worst, most disappointing game I have ever played. Ignacy is wrong. It is not enough for a designer to say 'Email me if you have any problems.' Design something elegant and fun where some basic measure of human intuition will help the players. Describe it accurately and comprehensively in the rulebook.  

This game is horrible stuff. I honestly feel the best option from Portal games would be to offer people their money back and take this one back to the design room.

I found this game to be a fiddly mess. The setup alone takes forever. Why wouldn't the board indicate clearly which tiles needed to be placed where? Why have those tiles on the board at all? They could have easily been two 12"x12" boards with the holes punched into them that you simply place beside the Mars map.

Beyond that, I really didn't enjoy spending half the game with my nose in my phone finding out what to do next. If I wanted to play on my phone, I'd play an app.

The game itself was interesting enough, but I don't see this as an improvement whatsoever over Robinson Crusoe.

Easier to learn if you've played Robinson Crusoe. I like it. Hoping to improve rating once I get to the campaigns.

Tried to play once and took over an hour to go through setup, rules, and a partial round.  It dragged on and decided to quit.

I own and love Robinson Crusoe, however this game seemed far more unnecessarily complex vs RC.  I also hate game which require apps to play.

The game warrants a full play, though, once rules are mastered.

I really liked Robinson Crusoe as a solitaire game. And I was really looking forward to this game because I'm a big fan of outer space and technology and complex games. But after reading through the rules several times and setting up several games, I kept running into rules problems. I could find various references in the rules book and on line but rarely clear answers. The app wasn't terribly helpful. For instance after telling me which random event occurred and reminding me to calculate how much oxygen and energy I had available, it never told me when to start assigning tasks for my astronaut(s) or ever noticed that I had not assigned any tasks at all.

After a few attempts, I decided I would have more fun playing a different game for the moment. I hope to come back and try First Martians again after the rule book has been revised.

I like First Martians. My science-driven, calculating heart finds satisfaction in the idea of pioneering a mars settlement and undertaking the preventive maintenance of my quaint little base. I felt that conveying the many aspects of the theme was well-thought out, and the app-driven implementation has been refined sufficiently since release to be more streamlined. In fact, for a game of this genre, there is nothing that offers as similar a grounded experience in space *settlement*. 

"Settlement" is the operative word here. Players coming into this game expecting an overarching space opera need not apply. This game is about realistic, scientifically-grounded settlement of Mars; Ignacy has pitched this from the initial announcement. Your problems in-game will not rear their head as gut-busting aliens, but rather, systems malfunctions. 

With that, the game becomes quite sterile, and though this operations management game may appeal to some, I can see how the greater populace will turn their nose up at it. I can appreciate the design, and the thought and planning that Ignacy has invested into the development of this game. It results in a breadth of problems to be solved in each scenario in an attempt to simulate the more realistic brutality of space-exploration. However, First Martians lacks any proper emergent excitement, as each scenario is simply working towards a deadline of sorts. Thus, my fun does not last very long. There are numerous more exciting or engaging co-operative titles out there.

(+) After the bulky mass of rules have been scrutinized, interpreted, and digested, the actual mechanisms of play are rather straightforward. In fact, players being taught First Martians will likely have an easier time learning it, than the player who is burdened to learn the game from the actual ruleset.
(+) Re-playability is present in the amount of "game" content: a multitude of re-playable missions and -two- campaigns in box. The component quality is downright outstanding.
(+) The gameplay retains some pizzazz in the uncertainty of the rolls, while still rewarding careful planning.

(-) Game documentation has typos and various errata. Out of the box, this is going to bewilder and frustrate many.
(-) Extremely high rules overhead. The most recent Almanac files here on boardgamegeek now mitigate the very poorly written rulebook, but I fear it is too late to retain the less-motivated masses of players who dismiss games upon a single play.
(-) In the end, it is a systems management game where excitement is lacking.

Very bad rulebook, too. 

Has the potential to improve but in its current state is simply not a good game.

RATING: 6
The app aspect, while thematically valid, was more of a turnoff than I'd predicted. Mechanics work well with each other, but literally everything is run through the app, almost feels like the board is just a physical surrogate. Not the prettiest board either, though well built.

If one person start to be familiar with the rules, game go smoothly. In that keys it is also easy to jump in, you just teach basic rules rest you tetch when it heppened during gameplay (newbis dont need to knew ewery rule to start and enjoy play). But getting familiar with rules at beggining (when you start with rules book) is kind of pain in the ass. Hope so that little changes in app make it easier to lern.

The first play was a bit of disappointment. Overall the game is an improvement over Robinson Crusoe, but it has the same language/rules issue 1st edition RC had. There were a few card texts that we couldn't exactly understand its effect, and some rules questions that we couldn't find the answers to. 
The biggest disappointment is the App. All it does is randomely generate events which I assume it has some ties to the Identify of the characters but there isn't a clear indication that this is the case nor a good narrative to suggest that. The app could do so much more such as tracking the malfunctions and resolving malfunction cards, as well as morale track and stress track. It could also do a lot better job at telling narratives for the events but at its current state the app add very little to the game. 
I really hope some of the wording/rules issue get resolved and the other missions are more interesting.

Fantastic game that if you use your imagination...even just a little, immerses you into an amazing world. Ignacy has done a great job in capturing the suspense and adventure I remember feeling when I fist watched Apollo 13. The system works extremely well and if you just invest a bit of time into getting to learn how things work you will have unlocked the portal to an amazing adventure you can visit again and again

-Heard the game gets more interesting after the tutorial scenario, but I don't really have a desire to give it another try since my first impression was so terrible. Heard Robinson Crusoe is better, so might give that a try instead and abandon using an app.

I was pleasantly surprised with gameplay. We used a couple of stand-alone scenarios to learn the game and then went with the non-legacy campaign. I enjoyed the longer-term ramification of campaign game decisions and the inherent uncertainty in future scenario goals (we found it helpful though challenging to make some longer-term investments versus focusing on short-term firefighting). I do think that this game requires the right group of players to cooperate effectively and maintain interest in the campaign.

Honestly, it didn't even really feel like I played much of the game.  We learned the rules for an hour, and then we made 4 or 5 decisions each over the course of another hour.  Then we lost due to one of us dying.  That was it.  I'll hold off on my final thoughts until I play a game of it where we definitely know we are playing by the right rules, but I'm not excited by what I've seen so far.

I held off on picking this up for 6 months based upon the amount of negative feedback, and I'm so glad that I did. Bear in mind that I only play this solo, but it is right up there with RC for me. I enjoy the theme just as much - it's just different is all.

I can understand some of the issues that people have with the game - my first couple of plays were spent consulting the rulebook and Rodneys watch it played pretty much constantly, but now it runs pretty smoothly. What I don't understand is the continual whinging about the rulebook. It could be clearer in some respects, but this is a complex game with a lot of exceptions. It just takes a bit of patience, but that patience will be rewarded.

RATING: 8
Familiar, but totally new.  Similar mechanisms to Robinson Cursoe, with the pawns either single or double usage to chance or guarantee an action.  Same dice to determine your chance actions.  A ton going on, like lots and lots to keep track of and the app helps a ton but at the same time doesn't do a ton for you.  Which is good, it is after all a board game.  There's so much more i would like to do to play and solve this game/system but it's dense and complicated.  One or two minor screw-ups could most definitely be the cause of a win or a loss.  Mat and I played 2 players on the intro mission and we needed two chance elements out of three to come up positive for us to win in the allotted rounds.  We lucked out, but we even after questioned whether we had done everything correctly.  We didn't even use all of the possible areas.  A lot more to explore with this, hope to have the opportunity!

Rule book is very confusing.

Very frustrating because I had high hopes for this game.

„ Pierwsi Marsjanie – Przygody na Czerwonej Planecie”, czyli Robinson na Marsie?

Plusy:
1.	Solidne komponenty.
2.	Grafiki.
3.	Aplikacja (daje wielkie możliwości rozwoju tytułu).
4.	Tryb solo.
5.	Kampania.
6.	Mechanika.
7.	Poziomy trudności.

Minusy:
1.	Brak wypraski.
2.	Aplikacja (bateriożerność).
3.	Instrukcja.

„Pierwsi Marsjanie – Przygody na Czerwonej Planecie”, wrażenia po 4 rozgrywkach solo w 1.(x2) i 2.(x2) scenariusz. (Wersja przedsprzedażowa)

Po otwarciu pudła ukazują się naszym oczom bardzo ciekawe grafiki, solidne i klimatyczne znaczniki oraz figurki (aż trzy), ale są one bardzo szczegółowe i wykonane z twardego tworzywa. Plansza na pierwszy rzut oka nie zrobiła na mnie wielkiego wrażenia, lecz wystarczyło przygotować ją do rozgrywki (przy pomocy aplikacji) i z kawałka tektury stała się panelem sterującym z tablicą kontrolną i radarem. Znaczniki z półprzezroczystego plastiku wydają się świecić jak prawdziwe kontrolki (oczywiście przy odpowiednim oświetleniu), za to czarne kosteczki czasami mi „znikały” (to może też kwestia oświetlenia… a może tylko ślepoty). Aplikacja zastępuje nam karty wydarzeń i przygód, które znamy z Robinsona, w zamian dostajemy karty uszkodzeń, ulepszeń, badań i jeszcze kilka talii. Jest też dużo żetonów, kafelków i innej tektury oraz kości, które działają tak jak w Robinsonie.
Podczas rozgrywki często (a może i zawsze) będziemy zmuszeni wybierać mniejsze zło np. zastąpimy niedziałającą część z działającą częścią z innego pomieszczenia, w którym ta usterka będzie mniej dotkliwa dla funkcjonowania HUB-a (w danym scenariuszu). Będą zdarzać się sytuacje, kiedy będziemy zmuszeni odłączyć całe pomieszczenie, aby uporać się z deficytem tlenu czy energii elektrycznej a maszyny, które mają nam pomagać przetrwać będą ulegać awariom. Opuszczenie HUB-a w celu eksploracji Marsa jak i pozyskiwania z niego niezbędnych surowców to niebezpieczne wyprawy, które mogą zakończyć się długą i bolesną śmiercią…, ale żeby nie było tak strasznie Mars skrywa też rzeczy, które (jeśli żywi dostarczymy je do HUB-a) ułatwią nam przetrwanie na tym czerwonym diable zwanym Marsem. Warto wspomnieć jeszcze o „kartach” przygód, ponieważ w przeciwieństwie do Robinsona nie możemy przewidzieć, jakie i kiedy pojawią się konsekwencje naszych decyzji.
Jeśli uda nam się przetrwać i zakończyć scenariusz sukcesem daje satysfakcję, która wzrasta proporcjonalnie do poziomu trudności.
Czy „Pierwsi Marsjanie” to „Robinson Crusoe” w nowej oprawie? Stanowczo i bezapelacyjnie NIE! Mamy tu mechaniki, które znamy z Robinsona (po 2 pionki do zarządzania działaniami kosmicznych osadników, po 3 kości do rozpatrywania akcji, itp.), ale trzeba pamiętać, że gry korzystające z tych samych mechanik bywają od siebie bardzo różne i tak jest w tym przypadku. W „ Pierwszych Marsjanach” mamy zapowiedzianą przez autora szczyptę gry euro jak i losowość oraz przygodę, takie połączenie do mnie przemawia i moim zdaniem to bardzo dobra gra. Aplikacja daje ogromne możliwości rozwoju gry bez konieczności drukowania nowych kart a to może (i mam nadzieję, że tak będzie) przełożyć się na ilość darmowych dodatków i długowieczność tytułu. Grę polecam i oceniam na 8/10

Given how much we loved Robinson Crusoe and the book/film the Martian, was a must-buy and quite an experience. But not as fun as a I thought, though I played through all 16 scenarios (Lauren gave up after 1 game). It just doesn't have the adventure of RC, though I am glad I played it and sold on.

I still am having issues understanding all the  nuances in the game & it frustrates me. I have played Robinson Crusoe & I really enjoy it! I also have learned quite a few rather complex games.  (e.g. Mage Knight the board game) But this game is quite difficult to understand all the concepts & mechanics, as a whole. I notice all the comparisons between Robinson Crusoe & this one, however, I wanted to treat this as it’s own game rather than just a reimplementation. It has a lot of fiddly mechanics, the components are quite nice but also quite abundant. I would likely try to play the game again & perhaps it will play smoother nex  game. But as for the first game, there were too many little questions I couldn’t get resolved, I  consistently had to consult the rulebook. (Keep in mind I had already watched the Watched it Played video & thoroughly read the rule book prior to playing). Oh, and that music that plays in the app is simply awful! I can either mute the phone or turn the sound off in the app which cuts the music & all sound effects. It doesn’t seem fitting for an adventure on the red planet. ????

After two plays I understand some of  the criticisms of this game and why its currently selling around $20.  Quite similar to Robinson Crusoe (RC) mechanically but whereas in RC the theme helped the mechanics and iconography feel intuitive and brought through a strong story, I have a harder time connecting those in First Martians which leads to a less enjoyable experience. I do want to play this game more, but at this point I feel I can safely say RC is the better game. My next step it to play through the campaign.

A 1, 2, 3 or 4 rating is simply rude for someone as wonderful, creative and accomplished a designer as Ignacy. In addition, all games are puzzles, so those that believe cooperative games are limited by the scope of their mechanisms need to rethink their idea of what a game is. My rank of 10 is a pure counter move plus keen insight - I may never rank this game lower because it may never need to be lower. ((Robinson Crusoe is brilliant)).

I bought this with the intention of playing it with my nephews, but the rules and maintenance didn't suit this game to playing it  with a younger crowd. Overall, the game is realistically only solitaire with limited replay value, but purchased off Amazon for $27 that is more than acceptable. It is probably wiser to view this as a video game that happens to have a board, than vice versa. It won't endure as a game you come back to over and over. The app is novel and perfectly suited to a game of this nature, but it could have gone even farther to reduce some of the maintenance throughout the game. My rating is solo, which this was never intended for, but I'm enjoying it.

[pre-order copy with a few extra stuff]

Overall I like the game; it's well produced and there is a ton of stuff inside; missions are varied and science-focused. 

Disclaimer: I rate Robinson a 10, have played it more than 150 times;
as an engineer with scientific background and loving everything about space exploration, I love the theme of First Martians much more, 
but I do not enjoy the gameplay as much as Robinson (not as good balance between mission objectives and surviving, fewer dilemnas overall)


[+] Theme, Components and Artwork (wish there was more), both Campaigns are great and show the potential of the app for story-telling/immersion, short play time (1 hour), rules are hard to learn but not complex once you know them, lots of missions to choose from,
[-] Events can be very swingy, you are forced to take risks (roll the dices) in order to have a chance of success due to time constraints, sometimes feel like it rewards luck more than smart decisions, often need 4/5/6 pawns for a single action (on ring 3), the App could do more (randomize setup, pictures/sounds, achievments), missions that ask you to print something beforehand

included Adventure Book: it's a really nice touch

Really love this game! My favorite right now (among a decent sized collection). To learn it best, watch the 'Watch it Played' video by Rodney Smith, and download the Almanac from the Portal Games website as a substitute manual. Also know that the training scenario is somewhat unexciting. That should eliminate the hurdles, and you'll discover that the other scenarios are excellent, and the first campaign is an awesome and immersive experience! I've yet to do the legacy campaign. The app is great too - I can't imagine how many extra cards there would be (in an already very full box) and how much shuffling.

Ok now I have played this a second time, well I guess one and a half since I couldn't get through the second game. There seem to be two camps when it comes to this game, one camp that dislikes the game largely due to the less than effective rules (being kind here),the needless complexity, and hardly helpful at all app; and then there seems to be another group that somehow gets past all of those issues and really enjoys the game. 

I am sad to say I fall in the first camp. I really cannot express how much that pains me to say (Robinson Crusoe is a 10 for me!), but I am confident I will never play this again. Now I am wishing that they would have made another Robinson Crusoe expansion instead of this.

I was so looking forward to "science-ing the shiitake out of this" co-op planet outpost survival  campaign with its beautiful expansive board and components, exciting possibilities with the inventory of assets and personnel, anticipating the next app driven event, and the dizzying array of system status indicators continuing into the horizon flashing green 5x5,  But then things go haywire with rules uncertainty and system admin begins to grind.  So frustrating--putting this aside for a bit and come back to it later.  I like Quinns suggestion, maybe cordon off an area in the game room and work through it with a solo run.

Lights and shadows for this game. I'll started for the lights:

- Much more easier to learn and play than I expected. Unofficial rules (that can be downloaded here in the BGG) helps a lot.
- Setup much faster than I expected. Once you have made a setup the rest are very fast.
- I find the game funny. It's true that most of the time you must be concentrated on the malfunctions inside the HUB, but since each mission has its own goals you have to make different things, so it's not repetitive.
- I don't mind the apps in boardgames, and I think its app adds a better experience.

This game could have a very good rate for me but these are its shadows:

- If you have bad luck at the beginning I find it very difficult to recover from this. I've had to left some plays in the middle because it was very obvious that I wouldn't been able to achieve the objectives.
- Some missions are very hard to understand.
- The worst for me, for some missions you have to print some tables from their website so you can track some goals! It's incredible annoying. Please, add these tracks in the game!!

Conclusion: I will play it more times for sure, but it's not the best game I've played.

Robinson is my favorite themed game, and my favorite coop.

If this has a similar experience with half the time investment then we're going have to change BGGs ranking system to go to 11.

If you want a great looking game that you need to house rule to win...then MAYBE First Martians is for you. Do not buy if you like losing games, reading instructions, watching other people playing it, being pissed off, losing, and long setup times.

I really wanted to love this game. My son bought it for me for Christmas, and we've played upwards of 8 times. Played all the variations of players. Played multiple scenarios.

I love:
- the visual style
- the missions are pretty neat
- the variations of the games are great.
- how it makes you feel like the movie The Martian (with MATT DAMON...tee hee)
- we actually liked the app. Could it be improved? Sure...but it's not as bad as some made it seem.

I hate:
- losing because the game can't be won
- reading hours of instructions
- having to rewatch setup videos again and again
- requiring house rules to make it better (we haven't, but feel like it would be improved if we did.)

Sadly I think this may end up being sold soon. We probably won't play it again.

Glad I went ahead and bought this despite some of the negative feedback. Works very well solo and thematically hit on all levels for me. Only complaint so far is how the malfunction box works... I think that needs some tweaking. Price has dropped as well so worth grabbing as long as the app works... speaking of the app... I like it. Didnt think I would, but I do. Works fine and works with the theme of the game - science'ng the shit out of a constant barrage of problems while trying to meet mission objectives.

Hate to say it. Tried a stand alone and the campaign and I truly just don’t care about what’s happening. Like things suck, try to make them suck less. That’s not fun.

1 play / 3 players

LIKE: Tense game, because there isn't much time to build your engine before the game is over. Love the dice for power, can I just roll these all day? I also enjoy the roundless aspect, because some planning can be calculated to play that to your advantage.

DISLIKE: Not as much focus on the engine as there is in obtaining points as a means to an end. The scoring bonuses are revealed randomly which can occasionally be swingy.

OVERALL: Solid game, but the engine building isn't as satisfying as I had hoped. More plays needed.

RATING: 7
Very fun worker placement game themed around buildings (cards) and the environment. I like the idea of placing workers anywhere - but first placement is cheaper (easier) than later. I don't find the dice for getting resources very compelling. The idea of continuous turns is also quite interesting and made the game flow well.

A little of the [b]Manhattan Project[/b] feel, but much more reminiscent of [b]Power Grid: Factory Manager[/b] to me.  Build your engine, but manage pollution.  The relative value of the resources is somewhat unclear on first play.  I think I like [b]PG: FM[/b] more.  The chunky bits and art here are nice.

Easy to learn and teach, fun but strategic, plays in a reasonable time and looks beautiful.

The downside is the luck of the draw for certain things like events or achievements. 

Overall a great game to play and I def. want to play it again.

RATING: 7
1st play: I was not a fan of Manhattan Project so I was pretty skeptical that I'd like this.  I was surprised by how great it is.  The game is well produced and it feels like any path could be successful to victory.  The dirty energy technologies are profitable but they pollute and make it harder to score some of the in-game victory point goals.  The nations give a different start position so you're nudged toward a particular path as being stronger, but I'm not sure how different they actually feel.  I'm looking forward to trying it again to determine if it feels similar each time.

2nd play: This time I tried to match a country with a goal that didn't make any sense and completely wrecked my progress.  I still loved the game.  Polution can really take a toll, managing very limited resources with a worker placement recall mechanic that is done differently than in other WP games, and I like the tension of recalling for a goal vs stretching for just one more round.  Serious improvement over Manhattan Project.

Played the pre-release version at GenCon 2015. The game is definitely a different game from Manhattan Project. 

I like the risk-taking elements with pollution. I think the only issues I had was 1.) timing with the resolution of the Climate Cards (at least I think that was the name) and the completion of my turn and 2.) down time due to larger groups of players. 

I can't wait to see the final art for this game.

RATING: 5
Early acquisition in the holiday season. Was really excited, but the game play just fell flat for Jen and I. 

Only a single play, something I somewhat regretted as I was mailing it off, but that session was so uninspiring as to negate any real need for reassessment. Jen particularly found the decision space in this game unenticing (many turns filled with bland choices that weren't ever particularly exciting).

My biggest gripes: 

1) no real sense of escalation with the buildings. This makes sense since Build A could arrived at the beginning, middle or end of the game (they have to be bland enough to accommodate the range of timings).

2) Combos were fairly basic, and the "singular color activation per turn" for building rule mitigated some interesting tableau dynamics, though I appreciate the extra layer it added to the decision of primary action. All in all, the tableau card activation stuff [i]was[/i] the best part of the experience, but all in all it left me wishing I was playing Feld's Macao instead.

3) Far too often towards the end of the game our desire for main board actions dried up. Most of our moves were of the "well.. I guess I'll take this resource" variety, and were driven more by our desire to activate personal cards than use public spaces. Jen even found herself stuck needing to activate brown personal card, but not having any spaces available to her (due to costs for placement and/or pollution placed on the region). I can only imagine this gets worse with more players. 

I succeeded in making it to the end of the game with zero pollution, and won by a point. 

Plan to re-evaluate a (re)purchase when/if an expansion gets announced.

RATING: 7
One play, feels like a reasonable entryish level worker placement. We missed the often missed rule where even if you don't pollute, YOU STILL REMOVE ONE POLLUTION FROM THE STACK WHEN RETURNING YOUR WORKERS HOME. Seriously, don't miss this rule or the game becomes interminable. Even with this considered, the game feels like it's missing something. There aren't really satisfying ways to build VP engines and no sense of escalation, just the same actions happening over and over with not much changing. Don't need to play it again but wouldn't hate it if I did.

I was all ready to dislike Energy Empire when I was persuaded to play it.  An engine building, resource converting, worker placing game, complete with cubes to push  (albeit cute transparent pink ones) and a point salad to finish.  Somehow it turned out greater than the sum of its awful parts.  All too often this combination of mechanisms produces games whose goals are opaque, and where getting from A to B takes you via C,D, E and F.  In contrast, Jolly and Laurie have made Energy Empire accessible, uncomplicated and smoothly playable. 

The artwork in the style of The Manhattan Project is appealing, while production quality is very good.  I particularly liked the little oil barrels and the girders.

This is a good worker placement game. Manhattan Project is my favorite worker placement game and this... is not a replacement. I like the pollution mechanic and the ability to stack workers/energy to go over another players action. However, I prefer the 'race' to get across the score threshold in MP rather than the game timer from MP:EE.

Fun and Enjoyable, a point salad worker placement game. I prefer the original MP over EE, as I feel this game has more things going on in it, but less strategical depth.

Absolutely great game. And yes I think it is better than the original. MP: EE is a worker placement game, but other than MP, there is less confrontation. The rules are fairly simple, but decessions are though. The game can be played in less than 2 hours. I absolutely love this game.

This is now my favorite worker placement game.

1. It has clever, novel mechanics. Among these are: non-exclusivity of worker spaces, but with increasing player-determined cost & different suits of buildings that allow you to specialize and splash your engine.

2. Great supporting systems: the pollution board, energy dice, global events, and oil drilling / buying are all tightly integrated and interesting.

3. Top notch graphics and components. The little wooden I-beams are wonderful.

4. Manageable session and turn lengths.

Impressive design.  All seemed very balanced.  I went for a Trump Nuke strategy.  The other two players went green.  I finished a close second, with the in-game green points - which I lost out on - proving decisive.  Flow of game exceptional as you increase placements onto cards you have purchased alongside more dice giving energy.  Players refreshing at different times worked well.  Very engaging game.  Hope to play again.

Very good medium weight worker placement game. Has strategic and tactical play. The dice-based energy collection is an enjoyable way to add dice rolling to this euro-style game. The choice between working or generating helps keep the game feeling dynamic. The game seems to have taken a bunch of popular mechanisms (variable player powers, variable set up, soft blocking, engine building, pace control, etc.) and combined them into a solid package.

One of the better new games I've played in 2017. It has an interesting worker placement set up with tableau building for your own workers and for scoring. Power plants are represented by dice and provide energy (sort of like bonus workers that just aren't quite as good) and pollution (not good). Dirtier plants give more energy, but also increase the chances of pollution. I knew nothing about this game before I played it and I've quite enjoyed my two plays of this game. That doesn't happen too often anymore.

RATING: 8.5
This worker placement game uses familiar methods  such as dice for resource production, and a use a worker or return all of your workers per turn choice. However, this game does so in a very fresh and enjoyable way, and with a theme and mechanics that flow together well enough to get into the game. While there are a lot of choices and certainly different paths to victory, the unique starting countries give you a more focused path that's fairly easy to go after without too much analysis paralysis. The components are good quality, and the mechanism of pairing your workers with energy to use a spot that has already been occupied helps the game avoid some of the typical frustrations that players often encounter with worker placement games. I'm ready to play this again with different player counts but so far I like the game a lot.

At first I didn't want to buy it because The Manhattan Project didn't work for me.

But it is a really good worker placement game with some cool mechanisms (energy dice and stacking of workers on energy).

Not sure there is a ton new here, but everything comes together really well, with the theme shining through as well.  The risk / reward of energy generation vs pollution works really well, and finding ways to mitigate the penalties is a fun puzzle to solve.  The whole thing having the Manhattan Project "brand" on it is stupid, as the games are nothing alike, but this game is one I am very much excited to try more of.

Based on one play...really enjoyed the engine/"civ" building aspect.
It's a pretty straight forward worker placement mechanic. Nothing overly new here but it comes together as being fun. Almost a bit too short...you want the game to go on a bit longer.

After 8 plays, there seems to be a dominant strategy of going for the green buildings that clean your environment.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great worker placement point-salad game with a strong engine-building element to it, but without any negative direct player interaction. 
++ Great theme (Building our nation from the mid 20th century to today, while still considering (or not) our environmental impact of doing so) that is really well implemented throughout the game and that is not often used in board games.
++ I love the Global Impact cards. It's a great implementation of "unknown" events cards that happen throughout the game after each stack of pollution are depleted (what I called the end of a decade) that introduce some fun randomness with varying effects. This Global Impact cards also very thematic.
++ I like the Energy Dice and their risk/reward mitigation. You have to consider whether you want productive die that can pollute, or clean energy die that are not really productive but won't pollute and in the end, in what proportion you buy them. Then the rolls, even though a form of randomness, are not that bad, since the span of the energy on the die faces is narrow (1 to 3 only) and by buying more productive dice, you will generate more most of the time.
++ I really like the asymmetric nation cards that tell us our starting ressources and our unique way to climb the United Nation track. This make the game even more thematic to be a nation and to have somewhat different starting resources and strategy.
++ Great graphic design of the main board, the player's boards and the cards. Everything you need to know is on the main board or the players boards, so it's easy to learn at first and easy to put to the table even if it has been a long time since.
++ Great components overall, especially the ressources tokens: The metal oil barrels, the wooden steel I-beam and even the plastic cubes are thematic.
++ An expansion is in the work.


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- There is some luck involve with the available cards to buy at the different market. So your required ressources to climb the UN track might be scarce in the game. This will not make you lose the game, but might make you lose the race to the top of the UN track though. But still, an experience players will adjust and mitigate this and make points elsewhere to compensate for this.
-- I would have wish for more Global Impact cards, to give every game a really different feel/flavor. The base game have 9 Early Global Impact cards but only 6 Late Global Impact cards, so I would have taken 3 more Late cards (I have ordered the Missile Crisis card to mitigate this).
-- It's weird that this game have a slower start than endings, as players tend to paralyse into analysis at the very beginning since there are so much options upfront to pursuit, and too little direction to take (but your Nation unique ressources cost to climb the UN track).

RATING: 6
I'm generally a fan of engine-building games, so it's not surprising that I enjoyed this game.

I thought the worker placement system was neat where you could add energy to your guys to duplicate someone else's placements, and the system of recovering your guys from the board meant you could watch what other people were doing and try to time things appropriately. The way you get to activate your cards to run your engine after playing in certain areas of the board was also neat.

Now, a couple things that made it so I didn't absolutely love the game:

1) The cards you build your engine with are pretty boring, and are mostly the standard "produce this thing" or "convert this thing into that thing" sort of thing. Games like Terraforming Mars have ruined games like Energy Empire for me, as they have a bajillion different unique cards that a ton of thought had to go into, and you're pumped when you see all these unique cards come up, and always excited to get your hands on new cards. You also sometimes play cards where you really feel you've made a big play in games like Terraforming Mars. In Manhattan Project, the cards are just pretty stale and samey in comparison, and you never feel like you hit the jackpot with anything... you just kind of plod along making minor improvements. 

2) I'm liking engine-building games less and less that don't allow you to shift gears easily. Here, you build up some cards, and eventually you auto-pilot the running of that engine, feeling like you just keep doing the same thing.  It kind of gets boring once you get into that mode vs. games that allow you to shift your engine a little more.

If you love worker placement, this is a pretty good riff on that sort of thing, and if you love engine-building games, it's also decent at that. Put together, everything just felt "pretty good" to me, to where I'd be happy to play if someone suggested it. Nothing mind blowing, but a well put together game that does a couple neat things.

Really good, medium-weight worker placement. The artwork and components are great and for a Euro, the theme is very well integrated. I love variability in my board games so I really enjoyed the asymmetrical countries and achievements to start the game as well as the random global events that come out each game. I also really like the choice between the cleaner dice that don't give as much energy versus the coal and nuclear dice that can really pollute your board. It lasts a bit too long with 2 players due to the number of pollution tokens per player to get through but highly recommended at 3+.

It has all of the issues of the genre though in that interactivity is limited to a rush for spaces, and even then it isn't much of a big deal since it just costs a little more to get in, so you generally don't pay much attention to the competition. It also highly encourages specialization, so in games with more than 3, it is important and somewhat beyond your control to specialize in the type of building others are not - otherwise you are competing for those spaces. 

I don't see huge replayability for the game. But could be fun for a few plays.

I'm guessing 2 players is not the best for this since all we did our game was specialize in 1 of the 3 areas and ran our engine as best we could with almost no care for what the other was doing. When you place a worker in a color area all cards you have of that color activate and there only seems to be an advantage for specializing in 1 color as much as possible with no real disadvantage. The engine you create with these structure cards was also not very interesting as they mostly get you some resources or convert resources and that's it, no special actions or feeling of uniqueness like the cards in Terraforming Mars or Viticulture. I also found getting energy to be too easy as I could keep doing whatever I wanted with my cards, and rarely felt like I had to make any tough choices. It is probably a better game with more since you would compete in certain areas, but I just don't have an interest in finding that out.

The first play of this left us feeling like the game went too long. I don't mean in terms of minutes, but, rather, we were able to have clean environments, 5 maxed-out achievements, and 5 dice well before the end of the game. So, the last several rounds were spent just buying the buildings with the most points whose pollution could readily be cleaned up. It got old quick at that point. A point-salad game needs to make me be restricted in my ability to get all the toppings. If I can max out all the options, then they aren't adding anything to the game.
We also wanted some player interaction. At 3p, there was not nearly enough interference. We were almost never prevented from doing everything we wanted.
To address this, on our next play (5p) we removed the first stack of pollution (we resolved the event, but not its scoring) and 1 pollution from each column. We increased the Achievement cost to 3 and also made a rule where you could use someone else's buildings, but you forfeited your worker when you generated. It turned out that price was too high - it should probably be $1 and an extra energy for the long commute.
These modifications greatly improved the game, but it still was not very interactive (I did have to dodge people a few times, at least), and we didn't max out each category like we had before. Winning score was 99 instead of 130-something, which was largely reflective of the difficulty in getting and completing Achievements, which felt much better.
Regardless, I don't think I will work to tweak this one further, but, rather, I'll let it go to a new home where it will be well loved.

I really enjoy worker placement games where you can play on any space as long as you have enough resources. This game also features some dice rolling and buildings where only you can play workers (a la Belfort). I like this one a lot more than the original Manhattan Project.

I helped to playtest versions of this game as a part of the Midwest Tabletop Design Group and a helper for Minion Games.  I saw it on the table through many iterations at Protospiel, too.

Very solid standard strategic game of economic management!  Easily on par with things like Imperial, Manhattan Project, or Puerto Rico.  And a good theme - the prosperity dividend from an era of peace post WWII, with its political jockeying and environmental, development concerns.

Tried to get them to name it The Long Boom... tragic it ends up with our other name suggestion.  :)

Hmmm.... I'm about 4 games in, and I'm just not sure about this one. It's way more point salady than Manhattan Project. In fact there is really no overarching "try to do X" at all. There's "build buildings", but not really a goal, since more is simply better. There's "keep your pollution board clean", but it's more about avoiding pollution than actually accomplishing something. There's "advance on the United Nations track", but that's really devoid of any life. Finally there's "get achievement tiles', which give unique goals per player. None of those things are awful, but it just makes players go, "now what am I trying to do exactly?" I will say that the way dice are used to get energy and possibly pollution is kinda neat. Overall I'm probably being a generous, but my son loves it, so I'm giving an extra point because I enjoy playing with him, I suppose.

Fantastic Worker Placement - many paths to victory, interesting engine building, and does it all in a quick time frame. The splash of dice rolling, 3 "zone" placement board, and player-controlled game tempo make Energy Empire a unique entry in a well-trodden game category that should keep it coming off the shelf with the other modern classics for years to come.

Updated after more plays - I continue to enjoy this game more each time. The variety of engines you can build is massive, and each nation gives you a different engine to try to piece together. Each aspect of the game offers you a new tension to balance, and you will rarely ever build the same strategy twice. Upped the rating to a 9 to reflect this becoming one my favorites.

Worker placement in which each player takes on the role of a country in the '70s-'80s, and tries to score points by developing its economy whilst safeguarding its environment.

Each round players place workers, consisting of labour and/or energy. On the main board you have to place labour, and if you want to use an action already containing a worker, you have to add 1 energy (if there are already 2 workers, you have to add 2 energy...). Each time you place a worker on the main board in one of the three main areas (commerce, industry and socio-environmental) you can also buy a structure (shopping mall, uranium mine, chemical plant, recycling centre...) linked to that theme/area. These structures (cards) can then be activated as well by means of labour and/or energy, each time labour is placed on an action field in that particular area on the main board. Energy alone is sufficient to activate the structures. A lot of the structures lead to pollution (air, soil or water) in your country at the moment they are bought. Some of the actions on the main board also trigger pollution. And each time you choose to regenerate (take back all your labour and throw away both used and unused energy) you have to throw dice in order to determine the amount of energy you obtain for your next round of actions, which can also trigger pollution. Energy dice can be obtained as a separate action on the main board, or by selling oil. The dice obtained on the main board can be stored on the country board (max. 5), the oil dice are temporary. Environmental clean-up is of course also one of the possible actions on the main board and on some of the structures.

Points are scored for:
1) a clean environment (max. 21 points at the end of the game + for clean air or soil or water each time a global event is triggered, which happens 6 times (each time a stack of pollution chits is emptied))
2) the structures you bought (each card has a VP value)
3) achievement cards you can obtain when you choose to regenerate when you still have at least 2 workers left (each achievement gives you a max. of 5 points, and this can be for the number of oil wells you have drilled, the number of industry structures you have, the size of your plastic or steel reserves...)
4) your advancement on the United Nations track (a separate action for which each country has to pay a different mix of money, steel, plastic, oil, science).
5) the number of energy dice you've collected (2 VP per die)

Seemed like a typical worker placement, resource gathering game with some interesting elements here and there. The unique country ability makes setting up the game different every time and the crisis cards to add some challenges. Overall one that I'll play again but nothing here really blew me out of the water.

[15 Aug 2017] - 7 (8 plays)
Took a bit of a break from the game and would rate the game higher after playing after this break. It's a decent worker placement game that plays pretty quickly. The crisis cards are random but impact all of the players equally so it's not going to unequally impact anyone in particular. There are lots of bits in the game and the amount of stuff on the table makes it less than fun to clean up. A custom insert would make this concern a mute point.

[29 Dec 2017] - 7 (10 plays)
Sold this game after completing the 10x10 challenge with it for the year. It's a fine worker placement game set in the MP universe. The game seems to decently through the use of dummy workers blocking off particular spots. After 10 plays, it just got routine for us and didn't offer enough other challenges or different game play. I suspect that the game could gain more life with an expansion that offers some additional crisis cards as well as some additional countries. Scenarios like the OPEC gas crisis of the 70s might also provide some interesting game play too.

[January 2017 - 7.3]
Relatively simple worker placement game with strong theme and good quality components. In that sense, it's a nice intro game, but certainly takes playing once for beginners to grasp what means what and how how everything fits together. I like the balance between energy/economy production and keeping your pollution at bay, plus, there would seem to be quite a few paths to victory. That being said, I think the game is a little too loose. Even at the player max of five people, you never feel much tension of being blocked out of an action -- you might have to spend more energy, but by mid game, you usually have enough to do what you want. So, not much interaction. The UN track/victory points is a bit lackluster... and similarly at the end of the game, the best thing tends to be to just buy a structure worth the most victory points, even though you don't really care about the structure itself. I think the ideas in the game are really clever, particularly with the energy generation and dice mechanic, but I feel like there should be more consequences for what decisions you make... like more pollution to your card actions, etc. The global impacts don't seem that damaging either, and for replayability, I'd like to see more of those cards as options. The good thing is that the game has a nice timer to it and plays quick in both turns and total time (about an hour, when everyone is up to speed).

There is nothing inherently [i]wrong [/i]with Manhattan Project: Energy Empire (other than perhaps the gratuitous branding since the game has no link to [thing=63628][/thing]), but there is nothing great about it either.  

To be fair the first half of the game is interesting as you build your engine and seek out card combos to get your machine working well.  But then rather than rising to a climax the game peters out and you simply end up attempting to trigger your card combos on rinse and repeat auto-pilot.  Nothing is difficult or challenging: pollution is easy to get rid of, events are rather uninteresting in their effect, achievements end up being of similar point value, and resources are not difficult to get hold of.

So it all works fine but no more than that.  Just OK and easily forgotten.

Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is not an expansion to Manhattan Project. Rather, it is a new worker placement game. It's has a similar place or pull worker aspect to it. That said, this game is far less confrontational than the original and includes dice. This could be good for some or bad for others. Beyond being less confrontational, it's also harder to block players from action spots than typical worker placement games. The theme of pollution is not wholly unique, but I feel is well represented.

This is a mid-weight euro that has pretty good variety (when you consider the starting nations, the building card stacks, and global events), excellent artwork/graphic design, excellent components, and a reasonable playing time. I would definitely recommend this game to people who like games such as Stone Age, Lords of Waterdeep, and Champions of Midgard.

What a delightful surprise this game was for me!  A solid euro-game with multiple interacting mechanisms interacting seamlessly and synergistically; some unique twists with regard to worker-placement/action-selection mechanisms; variable starting  resources and abilities; multiple paths to victory, with various tactical and strategic options; and a theme which aligns with and shines through the gameplay beautifully.  And then there is an included solitaire mode.

This game is a most satisfying solo euro-single-session experience, thus fitting nicely into this particular functional niche for me.  Should also prove to be a very enjoyable multi-player game.  Kudos and well done to all involved in its development.

RATING: 6
Manhattan Project: Energy Empire retains the basic worker placement scheme from the original Manhattan Project but otherwise works out quite differently. First off, player interaction is minimal. While I consider this slightly better than the original in-your-face agression this sits firmly too far on the opposite end of the spectrum. The scoring somewhat resembles a point salad to the point that it doesn't really seem to matter in what way you expand your energy empire just as long as you do. Strangely, though, towards the end I felt like it was sometimes quite hard to generate a meaningful amount of VP, so maybe a little bit of foresight wouldn't hurt after all but the random building supply makes that kind of difficult. In any case, the progressively shorter run-generate cycles lead to quite a few dead turns and additionally dilute the timing problems at the heart of the worker retrieval mechanism.
The restriction to five achievements and a maximum of 5 VP per achievement make them feel more like a consolation prize for players that cannot meaningfully use their remaining workforce than anything to actually aim for. That in turn unfortunately pushes the game strongly towards the tactical end and no doubt is a big part of the reason why it feels so salad-like.

Amazingly enough, this game was not designed by the folks who did Manhattan Project, and yet it feels very much like it is in the same vein, though they are both very different games. The same core concept of worker placement vs. recall your workers is there, but otherwise Energy Empire is its own thing. The worker placement aspect is pretty standard, though there is a nice way to outbid players to take used actions and possible block others from using them. A nice diversification of actions to take and buildings to buy. The pollution board is a nicely themed component that works well for the game. Little surprises from the Event deck keeps the game feeling fresh. Investing in Achievement bonuses by taking one or two fewer turns each round is smart. Turns go quick though lots to think about each turn. I am impressed by the quality of this game! At the end of the day though, it is a resource conversion game and as about as Euro as they come. But if you like Euros and worker placement games, there are ratings to be had from Energy Empire. Good show, Minion Games!

18JUN2017 : First solo game. Rules are really good and the game is easy to learn. That's a plus. I didn't like that I ran out of gold tokens though. I've also read some things about solo game where players tend to play their last few rounds playing off their purchased structures. That happened to me as well, but I don't feel like it's a bad thing because you can make your game really tough if you like. Just put more RED Global Impact cards up at the start of the game by replacing the green ones to calibrate how tough a game you want. What I really like about the game is all the things you can choose to do. Not sure this is good or bad, but I found I stuck to purchasing structures that didn't pollute and then getting Achievements that worked to produce victory points. I think 3 or more players make this game a lot more challenging although I've not played the game with anyone else yet. 

19JUN2017 : Second game. Really had fun with it. Not to hard to setup for a second game once you've played one. I love the engine building and synergy. Even when I winged it on this game, I found ways to make victory points. It's quite fun.

If this was just "Energy Empire," it would be better.  This is a solidly made Euro but it lacks the soul, feeling of theme and art style of the original.  It also lacks the freedom of the original because, instead of being able to go to any building that you OR your opponents have built. you can only go to buildings of your own that match the color of the action you take.

-Very little player interaction.
-Board is wide open so reduces tension even further.
-UN track might be a little over-powered. Absolutely necessary to hit that every turn.
-Scoring is all end-game but this can be house-ruled to score as you go.

United Nation serves no purpose and should be removed or improved. You could put bonus instead of useless crappy VPs on the track like rebates on cash expenses due to good relations with other nations, and higher would lessen the effects of war or other bad things.

Things that just give VPs are useless and should not be included in a game.

I think this is the biggest thing about poorly designed VP hoarding games, useless VP generating spaces like the UN in this game. I would never waste my time and resources increasing my status in UN while I can increase my wealth or production or research/gov.

Also, the game could have had probably a better way to determine a winner than dull uncreative VPs. Probably the one who accomplishes his goal first, achieves the common goal, or the wealthiest nation at the end of the game if no one achieves the goals for example. That would give the game three different endings.

I am pretty much tired of VP games, they are just clones of each other with a new gimmick, but are pretty much the same thing as the last one. :/

Very nice and thematic game that captures the pollution problem better than most other games that tried to fill this spot. If this was just a bit more complicated or filled with more stuff, I wouldn't like it as much. Just a small tad more and I would call it clunky.

Great stuff and miles better than the name giving original.

An accessible medium weight Euro.  Game is well balanced as scores are usually a close affair.  Components are very thick.

Game mechanics are straight forward and make sense, making the game easy to pick up.  You will need to play one or more games to see some of the possible combos

Theme is well rendered, although some items are a bit odd (Education generating 1 pollution).

The six game events, triggered by the Pollution time clock, keeps the game different and provides good reply value, as those the appearance of the different Government, Industry and Commerce structure cards.

Game can be played solo, which is a plus for some of us.  :)

Very quick but solid Euro game.  Doesn't have the bombing or espionage that the original Manhattan Project does, but it does stay true to the worker mechanic and improves on it.

The game feels like it is over before you really get involved in it.  Number of turns is limited so you need to execute your strategy quickly or else you will fall behind.

Only the first play and it was just a learning run through.  I want to love it.  At first it seemed cool and the theme really shined.  I played Canada vs China and I found myself making thematic choices.  

But there were two things that dragged the game down for me.  The path to VPs seemed obfuscated (to me) and I found it hard to connect to the best path forward.  It was pretty easy to max the goals since I could only get 5 vps per goal so it felt like I was wandering around the board a bit at the end.  

Finally, assuming I was playing correctly, in order to activate my building I must put workers on the industry and then on the actual building.  It seemed weird and made it cheaper to play the common areas for resources vs my own buildings.  

Hopefully I've made rules errors (likely!) or will find the game shines with the competition of an actual adversary, but I'm worried my gaming partner is not going to be up for this game.

RATING: 9.3
Full disclosure: I've never played the original, so I don't know how it stacks up.

This is a brilliant, mid/heavy economic simulation game with the theme of the international energy industry. Kind of a Power Grid+ in terms of theme. The mechanics are rock-solid; it has a few twists on worker-placement that make it unique in my mind, but it never bogs down a-la Simurgh.

The production values are top notch; excellent resource bits combined with beautifully printed and illustrated cards and board make it pretty to look at when set up.

It works fantastically at two players, and I can only imagine it'd fare better at the higher player counts (at the expense of longer play times).

While the stacking mechanism doesn't quite substitute for the direct player interaction of the original, this is a very good, tight worker placement game with difficult choices to make. Complaint: the nation cards are almost useless after the first few rounds, as everyone rushes to score points in the UN. Wish they had a multi/second function.

Did not enjoy this as much as I was expecting to. Doesn't really feel like you have many viable choices or paths to victory. It's not a game where every choice you make feels good. You can't do what you want to do, you really have to follow a prescribed order of actions which is not enjoyable to me. One thing I liked is that it doesn't have the leader targeting MP does but also isn't as enjoyable with 2p as MP to me.

I'm a little bit tired of worker placement games, but something about this one just pushes all the right buttons for me.

This has some similar elements to Manhattan Project, for instance, you must choose each round whether you will pull your works back or put one out; and also you have a tableau to manage with buildings you can purchase and that can only be activated by you when you put a worker in corresponding area on the board. Layered on top of this worker placement/engine building game is a unique resource management component.  The game forces you to manage "energy production"-- energy is crucial because it can act as workers (in some places) and allows you to occupy spaces already occupied by other players.  Energy is acquired by purchasing permanent dice or converting oil into temporary dice, that are rolled when pulling workers back -- but generating energy causes pollution (as does purchasing some buildings and processing oil into resources).  To maximize your points you must try to clean pollution off of your tableau. Thus, the game centers around acquiring resources, combo-ing your structures, and clearing pollution to maximize your points. Energy Empire totally removes the "take that" that was present in orginal Manhattan Project and the tempo of the game is very different instead of racing to build a few bombs the entire game is centered around making choices to maximize your points. The game presents a nice little puzzle based on the available buildings and starting country choices as well as crucial timing choices (when to pull workers back, when to take pollution and perhaps, trigger global events). Overall, this is a well designed game can play in 60-90 minutes with 2 players. Because of the more even tempo and removal of the tack that element I prefer this to Manhattan Project.  While I cannot begrudge anything about the design (it is rock solid) or the components, the game does lack a certain "fun" element- this is likely because being forced to manage a negative (pollution) is inherently not as fun as always being able to always take positive actions. All-in-all while there are better worker placement games out there this is a rock solid and enjoyable game.

1 solo play. Nondescript and boring. Just convert one thing to another, with no tension and very few obstacles, to try and get as high a score as possible - I had reached the requisite 100 point goal and achievements well before the end of the game without really trying (as out of frustration and a growing lack of interest I decided to calculate my score before the end game was triggered). Cards are samey, with the Global Impact cards especially underwhelming. As the game has been getting raves it appears the solo mode was an afterthought. Will drag myself to try it again with different nation cards to see if it redeems itself due to the amount I paid for the game. The solo variant of the original Manhattan Project posted on BGG is far, far superior.
EDIT: After three solo plays with different nation cards, my rating has gone up marginally but initial impressions remain. Create your engine, accumulate resources, game end triggers and calculate your score. The game runs smoothly as far as it goes but it's otherwise unremarkable, with no no surprises or moments of brilliance. All in all, the solo game is more a practice run for multiplayer sessions than a compelling mode in its own right, which is probably the intention. Probably will sell.

My first solo play was okay, but the 2-player game was much more enjoyable. I think I will revisit the solo game, and I really look forward to 3 and 4 player games. I fear that 5 player might be too tight. 

Good game with an excellent theme and interesting take on worker placement. I very much appreciate the way you can trigger your buildings whenever you use the corresponding section of the main board. The importance of the timing of your reset/energy generation is another really great feature.

However, I really have little desire to play this again. Probably I will keep it for a while longer and see if it is better with 4 players.

It's not bad and certainly has some nice ideas going for it. But overall the gameplay just didn't captivate me enough. The end game was considerably prolonged as most players were avoiding pollution and so the last couple of turns really dragged. There was no longer any really progress since a couple of players had already achieved everything for their strategy and others couldn't do anything meaningful to advance theirs and so everybody was just grabbing whatever cheap points were left to be picked up.

One of the best worker placement games I've played. The theme comes shining through in every way. From the buildings to purchase, to the artwork, and abilities of each of the different countries. While the game has a lot going on and a small munitions dump of components, the game is rather easy to play and understand. 

It had multiple paths you can take to victory, load up on high cost pollution buildings and dice, or go small energy dice no pollution and low VP no pollution buildings. Those are just 2 of the possible paths you can take. Really great game and of of my favorites of 2016.

Very well flowing game with interesting game mechanics and a very motivating save-the-environment-theme. Only small problem: It feels not like an Energy Empire, because energy production and the powerplant dice have almost no impact on scoring. Think about it more like an "Ökolopoly" or very much "20th Century". Still that it why I really enjoy it.

After some plays we noticed that the best strategy is ignore workers, environment, power plants etc., just make the round as short as possible and always only grab one cheap building. At the end most times you will win because the other strategies have no time to develop. But this really feels like cheating the game, almost breaking it, because this can't be the intend of an "energy empire". Rated down to 7. Have to observe...

Really have enjoyed this one and I can't wait to bring it to the table again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first play of this one. Seems to be a couple different avenues to points and one is building a bit of an engine as one can activate all the buildings of one color if one has enough energy/manpower when one chooses an action of that color. The use of energy to either allow you take an action previously selected or as a token available to use for one of those building actions is nicely integrated. The dice providing energy and pollution is also well implemented in the game. Worker placement done well and in an interesting manner. The pollution aspect on your own board as well as it potentially affecting your scoring when the global crisis cards strike is also a nice touch. All in all, I found it fun with meaningful decisions.

First things first, I love engine building games so this game immediately hopped on my radar.  Unfortunately, this is a very generic engine building game.  Only played 3 times so I don't have any insightful comments.  The cards felt too similar and the resource conversion also felt very bland.  It never felt like you were making any sort of big moves, even when you were triggering a bunch of cards.  The pollution aspect also felt pretty lackluster.  It was fairly easy to remove pollution so there wasn't a big spread on points earned for lack of pollution.

RATING: 8
Excellent worker placement game with an engaging theme and wonderful presentation. Worker placement is handled perfectly, with every decision linked to others in different ways. The mechanic of "stacking" workers with power to pay for spaces already played by others is unique and results in lots of interesting decisions.

The theme is executed perfectly, with the custom power plant dice stealing the show. Player boards can quickly become choked with pollution and reward balance between meeting the needs of a growing economy and maintaining a clean environment.

Bought from Amazon 12/29/16.

A really solid worker placement.  While the engine building works well, it doesn't really do anything new.  Managing pollution and energy production is fun, and the game has a good sense of escalation.  Around half of the buildings don't seem very useful, often leading to one of us buying a building just for the points and because we have extra resources.

All in all, it's a good game, but I can't see us ever clamoring to play it like Terraforming Mars or Scythe.

+ Good production quality
+ Good sense of engine building
+ Cards combo into huge epic turns
- A lot of buildings don't feel very useful
- Nothing new

Nicely designed but ultimately run of the mill worker placement and resource conversion game.

Update - Warmed up to it a little more on another playthrough with three players instead of twoDeciding whether to use all of your workers/energy or stop and get an achievement is an interesting decision point. The board is also a bit tighter, especially the card purchasing slots. Also interesting is determining which cards to activate. Sometimes you might just buy a card for the points (especially if it doesn't hurt the environment) and not want to activate it.

This game has the makings of being great, but I've yet to determine where it will ultimately fall. The mechanics are deep with a lot of room for subtlety, and all information is essentially public, making this one of the better competitive board games I've played. 

The only downside is that the game end mechanics are at best frustrating to new players and at worst unbalanced, heavily favoring being earlier in the starting order. I'll know more as I play more, and this is certainly one that will see a lot of play in the near future.

One of my favorite worker placement games of 2016 and one of my favorites of the genre overall. Most games start out the same with players competing to get up the UN track the fast then it transitions into an engine building game. Worker placement in this game is very interesting. You do not block a space from another player, instead you make them work harder to use that space burning their energy. The component quality of this game is awesome so much high quality wood and plastic. The cards are very good quality and if the piece needed to be card board its super thick card board. This game marries worker placement and engine building brilliantly and I'm always super excited to get it to the table. There's a reason why this game won many people's 2016 Game of the Year Award.

Stored in bitbox medium. Original box stored in Box #2 at Dad's.

This was fine. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but as far as worker placement games go, this is a pretty solid one. The environmental theme is one that is prevalent and isn't used all that often, so it has that going for it. I just found the overall worker placement aspect to be kind of half-hearted. Most of the advantageous places to put them are in your own buildings, and this is one of those games where you can just decide you want to dabble into one kind of energy over another, which gives the game a very unfocused feel. There's all these different resources, and they only really serve to create alternate forms of getting the same thing accomplished. I get that this works thematically, but it just felt a little too unfocused for my tastes. It felt very Rosenburg-esque in this way. Overall I thought this was a decent game, but not as deserving of the praise it has been receiving.

I also think it was a mistake to brand this with the Manhattan Project name, especially since it has nothing to do with that game at all. I think most people will see this game, and compare it unfavorably against the original MP. At the same time, it's tough to sell an environmentalism theme.

I've played with 2, 3 and once solo.
Wouldn't recommend solo. 2 was good, 3 was very good. Nice mechanics and out-of-sync worker placement interaction. Would love to try 4 or 5 players. For an engine builder, it can feel like it is lacking a sense of escalation in the late game, but if you get enough of the right buildings and activate them all in one move, you can get that.

RATING: 4
I got bored of this game very quickly when I 'figured out' how to play with a winning strategy, and my method also slowed the game down a lot, which meant it dragged excessively. Quality of the components is so-so, would have preferred nicer 'workers' and better player mats.

A great reimplementation of the Manhattan Project system.  This game is the best of the three as far as fitting in our family's gaming style.  Plays less combative than the original game can be, but in a longer and more fulfilling way than the Chain Reaction game is.  Definitely worth a look if you like worker placement.

Players are a country, using workers and energy to buy buildings, advance on the UN track and activate buildings.  It's a worker placement game in that you can buy buildings after you place a worker in an area. To activate a building, you need to have a worker in that area as well.  When all your workers and energy are done, you can generate, which gives you more energy but generally creates pollution on your enviornment. If you can manage your environment, by getting clean dice, then you will score more environment points. 

There are a lot of interesting things going on, but there is some downtime as you watch your opponents activate a string of buildings. Sure, the more you play, the more you get used to it. I don't mind it. I played once, and willing to try again, but it didn't strike me as one of those games I want to play over and over.

Only played solo so far, but I've really enjoyed it. There are a fair number of concepts to learn, but the game is so thematic and the theme is really well-integrated with the gameplay.

A nice worker placement game with little in common with the original other than the name.

The rounds can move very quick, as the pollution tracker seems to advance at quite a rate. There are some nice decisions, do you go for industry early on and just take the hit on pollution, or focus on science and then deal with the pollution as it happens?

Wow, this one blew me away (pun definitely intended)!

I like me some worker placement games, but this one was a surprise to me. It's also a tableaux-builder, which is something I enjoy working through. Generating power is also a nice thing to do on your turn. Rolling those weird environmentally friendly/harmful dice is a lot of fun.

I like that each player plays as a country, and that their starting resources loosely reflects that country's strength in the real world.

[b]The Manhattan Project: Energy Empire[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Prior to picking up Energy Empire I played the original Manhattan Project and really enjoyed the combination of worker placement and tableau building. However; I wasn't too keen on the bombing mechanic. This was not due to the direct conflict, but more because it didn't seem well integrated into the mechanics of the game and going down that path could really push you back in other areas. Still I thought about getting the game because of the tableau/engine building of the game was a lot of fun. After some research I decided to instead get a copy of their follow up game Manhattan Project: Energy Empire because it seemed to offer some game play improvements and added more complexity while still using the same game play mechanics. 

I've played a few two player games with my son and we've both enjoyed Energy Empire immensely. The worker placement mechanics are the same as the original Manhattan Project with the addition of having energy as well as workers. Energy be used to trigger some building powers or be stacked under workers in order to use a space already occupied by other workers [i](your stack needs to be one higher than the tallest stack already there).[/i] Also, when you recall workers you will also generate energy by rolling energy dice you have built which may lead to your player board getting pollution. Pollution is something you have to manage since having a clean board can be a significant source of points. 

Also added to the game are end game achievements you can collect, these goals will influence your strategy and keep the game fresh as you explore different scoring opportunities. The other significant change is how the buildings you own get activated; the main board is divided into three sections. When you place a worker onto the main board you can also activate the buildings in your tableau that match the building type of the one you just activated on the main board. There are some more differences, but I think it's pretty clear that Energy Empire is a step up in complexity and overall game play variety compared to The Manhattan Project while still maintaining all of the mechanics that made The Manhattan Project so much fun to play. 

Energy Empire is a mid-weight Euro [i](maybe leaning towards the light/medium side)[/i] that plays quickly, my son and I were playing games in under an hour. I am really coming to appreciate games that offer a deep game play experience that wrap up in an hour [i](I've also been enjoying First Class and Coal Baron: TCG, a couple of newer games that fit this model)[/i]. I would highly recommend Energy Empire to folks that enjoy both worker placement and/or tableau/engine building games. The game play is smooth, the rules are easy to learn and there is plenty to explore in terms of strategy which will give Energy Empire a long shelf life.[/i]

Great theme, but doesn't work that well with two players. One color buying strategy is too strong. Once you get two or three buildings of same color there is zero incentive to split to another color.  Too easy to get rid of pollution. Last third of game is going on autopilot as you keep running your engine over and over. The achievements are too similar and boring.  The hidden events not exciting either. UN track must be played or you will lose. 3 plays and done. Great rulebook. Very easy to understand.

Gioco davvero bello. Appartiene alla categoria dei german "medi" che amo molto perché facili da intavolare e giocare con chiunque ma in grado di offrire un livello di sfida ed una profondità non banali. Per capirci qualcosa di equiparabile a Marco Polo.

Venendo al gioco si tratta di un piazzamento lavoratori con combo di carte e gestione risorse. Nulla di particolarmente originale sebbene l'idea delle pile sia carina non è una novità assoluta. Tutto però scorre bene ed è condito con materiali davvero sontuosi (purtroppo anche il prezzo è, conseguentemente, importante).

Carina anche la grafica sebbene le plance a "foglio" sono robuste ma mi infastidiscono.

Il gioco dura poco (in 5 si sta in due ore anche alle prime partite) ma offre tante scelte mai banali e una discreta varità di vie per la vittoria. Per me promosso a pieni voti quindi.

Manhattan Project: Energy Empire is a dynamic worker-placement game in the same vein as the original Manhattan Project.  Players can place workers to perform certain actions, and depending on what actions they have taken, they may also activate one or more personal buildings by placing workers on them.  Occupied spaces aren't necessarily blocked off either, as players can place more workers on the same spot to also take that action.  Once all a player's workers are placed, they can spend a turn to take their workers back.  Players can also buy dice that are rolled during each take-back turn that provide them with more workers to use, but those dice might also produce pollution, which are placed on the player's map board and reduce their point scoring.  There are a number of actions that can be taken, such as getting more workers, cleaning up pollution, trading goods for money or other goods, speculating on the oil market, or buying buildings that do many of these same things.  I enjoyed this one, and felt that dynamic worker-placement worked very well without the take-that that's in the original Manhattan Project.

I was SUPER surprised to find this game was not an expansion for Manhattan Project. Honestly, I think it is a terrible name for the game and they should have reversed the title. Ah well, too late now, but I tried this game. It is a worker placement game with the use of dice to help manipulate your energy production. It really is an engine builder but it plays out so quickly I barely felt the building part to the game. I left me feeling a bit incomplete. I never fully got going before it ended. Would benefit for a few more rounds I think. For me it was OK and I would play again.

Clean, crisp engine builder that is very easy to grasp and plays pretty quickly. It does seem like the game ends a little too soon. I felt like I just got my engine rolling and then the game end is triggered. Overall, I love the action chaining mechanics by activating cards with the same category as well as the pollution and cleanup elements. I feel like the UN track is too expensive (worker/energy-wise) in the early game.

RATING: 8
A dynamic worker-placement game. I liked how hit provided some different avenues to score points, and includes a bit of engine building. Buildings are in 3 major categories and you can activate all the buildings of color if you have enough energy and workers. I liked the use of energy to extend the power of your workers. Workers don't really block later actions, but do make it more expensive to perform so you do have plan ahead. Once you've placed your workers and energy you take them back and use dice to determine how much energy you get for the next turn. This can cause pollution which adversely impacts your score. 

A fun game with a lot of meaningful decisions.

I had the choice of waiting several months for my FLGS to get copies or over pay for one now.  I have to also consider that in a month, I will be getting a new addition to my family, thus I won't have as much time to play games.

I chose the latter and was happy to find out it was so worth it!  The components are the highest quality I've ever seen, the game oozes of theme, and mechanics are so smooth and streamlined.  We will be playing this game as much as we can this month!

I enjoy worker placement, and this one didn't disappoint.  What I love about this game is how fast paced it can move when you have a group of people who know what they're doing.  Play to the board, then while you work on your tableau the next player can be playing to the board.

There are so many great decisions to be made while playing.  I simply can't praise this game enough.

A wonderful mid-weight worker placement game. I like how you aren't truly blocked from a spot. You can add energy to your workers to move into occupied spots. Energy is also used to activate purchased buildings as well and therefore very powerful. It's not something just given to you and you have to work to get energy producing dice (which add a slight element of luck, but I didn't find too swingy). The fact that there aren't designated rounds to get your workers back is very interesting and gives you another level of control. Pollution does need to be managed and can yield a decent amount of points throughout the game, but I've heard of people having success ignoring it as well. The United Nations track does give you some initial goals to work for with a good amount of points available there. The unique player powers of the nations with starting resources and ways of moving up the United Nations track is a good touch. So much to like about this game.

Hmmm, not mindblown after 2 plays. I think this game will shine with 3+ players. 2 players felt quite open, and I never felt like I wouldn't be able to complete anything if I timed it right. I do like the global impact track, which acts as the game's timer, ensuring games don't drag at any player count, and that is quite clever. I do like the engine building and variety of things to do. However, I felt like the buildings were all super basic and mostly similar all throughout the game. The game is interesting though, and it has a beautiful presence. I also feel like it has potential to be very good with higher player count, so I'll take it to the game group and try to get it played with 4 or more.

For me it's a game of two halves. The first is fascinating as you build your country up with all these new technologies and buildings. Every turn holds a plethora of choices as you try and get some engine built up where the pieces work well together. Unfortunately the second half of the game is rather dull. By the time you've built a good synergy you then find yourself in a run-run-generate cycle, or even just a run-UN-generate cycle. Choices become more obvious. The lack of player interaction becomes more noticeable. The excitement simply isn't there. Events are fairly meaningless. The achievements usually always end up being worth an easy five points each. All the resources (including money) are just too easy to come by. Pollution too easy to get rid of.

I enjoy the worker player system and the building and the beautiful bits. I get the feeling that a rules tweak could greatly improve the experience. For a start, the ability to just run all your buildings of a certain type at once - energy permitting, and it usually is - well, it encourages the specialisation that makes the end game boring.

Gosh, I'd hoped for something better. I'm rather disappointed in this one because I can see the potential is there.

A less tense and more relaxing offspring of The Manhattan Project. The game scales well at all player counts and plays relatively fast. While playing one gets a distinct impression that this game has been thoroughly play-tested with all the rough edges smoothed over.  The end result is a somewhat forgettable, but fun, gaming experience.

Really enjoyed this game.  I like worker placement games and this is one of the better ones I have played.  Lots of choices and options to gain vps while tracking what your opponents are doing and trying to beat them to the punch or knock down their strategy a bit.  I also like the theme of building an energy empire while trying not to pollute the environment.

Awesome eurogame, gets bonus points for the great components.

There is basically no interaction in this game, the engine building is nice but is not enough to keep me interested. A pity really, because the theme is so well implemented. For me it directly competes with Troyes, which is just a much better game.

Also one promising strategy seems to be: "Just build buildings and ignore anything else". I witnessed several games where a total noob crushed experienced players with this strategy while not even utilizing the buildings much.

I liked this way more than I thought I would. It has a lot of different mechanics going on but it is implemented very well and I did not find it in the least bit difficult. Our group played this back to back the first time we played. That is extremely rare with us and points to how good it is.

A worthy companion to it's namesake older cousin.  It's worth owning both.  This game scores a little differently than TMP, but I think I like this scoring more.  You are rewarded for building buildings, moving on the UN track, and achieving personal goals.

I played the prototype and it is a multiple solitare game where you are trying to limit the amount of pollution in your countryside while creating energy to run your empire.  The mechanics drive your to concentrate in one or two of three areas that is decided by choices you make before the game starts.  Your countries starting provisions often drive you to select choices in one of the three areas then the mechanics keep you primarily in those sections for the rest of the game.  I felt like the game ...... to a certain degree was playing me rather than I was playing the game.  I would look over the entire board to decide to do things but the advantages of staying in one area over trying other things overwhelming that I stayed in the commerce area and had a powerful commerce money making engine.  I would play the game again.

played the real game and I still styed in commerce and kicked but with a vp engine that was producing about 9 vp's each turn

RATING: 9
Wonderful, well-oiled machine that engages throughout. Multiple layers and constant decision-making may lead to some brief AP until you get used to things, but that's OK - the game still flows exceedingly well.

Love the thick cardboard pieces. The 10 individual nations are a nice touch.

This euro actually has theme (shocking!).

The solo game is just OK (especially when learning the game), but it falls apart when one realizes the best strategy is to focus on non-polluting structures for VP's. I have not tried the automa variant yet.

The game "wowed" me - an instant classic!

Energy Empire sits within the Manhattan Project brand but has no links that I can see. it is a very solid worker placement system that supports an interesting business/environment game. it is almost outstanding but there is something missing. One of my correspondents doesn't like worker placement. Another dislikes point salads. A regular opponent doesnt like cube converters. This is all three. I would have been pleased to have designed this, but as one player said, they have a machine for worker placement games these days. A sound 7.5.

Aaah, marketing. You have a popular game. You have a new design that has little tot do with the first one, except that they're both strategy games. Why not slap the first game's name on the box? Won't hurt sales, even thought his game has nothing to do with developing nuclear weapons.
Anyway... Players start with different resources. These are used to do actions to get more/other resources. And to eventually build buildings and other things that give abilities and/or points. Nothing new there. The main mechanism is a worker placement system almost identical to [thing=143515][/thing]. Nothing new there. So not all that original, but who cares, it's put together efficiently. It's a fun challenge to play. It does feel like you need to work really hard to only accomplish a few small things, so that makes the game a bit heavier than expected.
I find this a very solid, if unoriginal, design. Certainly worth a go!

The past few years have been really sparse for me as far as gaming goes.  Life has a way of stealing time even when you are looking, so when you aren’t looking, which I tended towards for awhile, it’s like time just gives itself away.  But I digress.

I guess this game made the rounds after it came out.  I always wanted to play the original Manhattan Project, but just never got around to it.  After playing Energy Empire, maybe that was for the best, as EE is outstanding in almost every way.

From gameplay to presentation to components, it falls just short of entering the same space as Scythe (which is still the benchmark for those three categories combined).  

For a mid weight mostly Euro game, the first game just whipped by.  Maybe if I had enough time and patience to play many times and dissect the game, I’d find something to dislike.  But as of now, I have nothing but good things to say about Energy Empire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First play impression: It's really good. Similar to the excellent Steam Time in that it doesn't do anything new with worker placement, but perfects the formula.

In Energy Empire you can acquire new structures, which are basically worker placement spots that only you can access. This lets you set up little combos and plan for the future.

I was curious about the impact of the dice going into this, but they work really well in practice. There is a risk/reward element to the dice where you can get more guaranteed energy from certain dice, but they're also more likely to give you pollution, which results in negative points unless you waste actions to clean it up.

The achievement system is well done here. Each achievement gives a maximum of five points and you can only ever have five achievement tiles. So you never feel like somebody just got lucky by getting the strongest or most achievements.

Multiple paths seem viable, as we took different paths in my one two-player game and ended up within one point of each other.

So far I'm really liking the game. Will rate after more plays.

02.04.17 Worker placement game. Workers don't block the other player.  Resource slots generate energy dice.  The dice produce pollution which is the time mechanism and energy for bonus actions.  Pretty open ended with choices and paths to victory.  Can finish the game in 1 hour.

Heard about this in BoardGameDesignLab podcast #2, "How to work with a co-designer with Luke Laurie", from Dec 13, 2016. Luke made this game with Tom Jolly.

You can go for different types of energy, but each one you go for has different trade offs (oil leads to more pollution, nuclear has random meltdowns, and solar/wind is less efficient). The theme sounds cool, though the podcast focused on the mechanics.

Does not work for low player count. It's far to easy to 'achieve everything'. In my past games, both players had >25 points from environment, 5 dice each, 25 points from achievements,  both on spaces 14-17 of UN, both around 30VP from buildings.

Also does not work solo, because of how punishing it is to take pollution. You are basically forced to keep things as clean as possible.

It may be much better with 4 players, but with 1-3 it's just not fun/satisfying.

Energy Empire is loosely connected to Manhattan Project. They share a similar art style, and they both use "place a main worker and trigger the buildings you own" and "recall all your workers" mechanisms.

In EE you have three workers which can be placed on action spots. In addition to workers, you also generate power, which can be used to augment workers or trigger your own buildings. On the main board, you can only place on an action spot if your worker is "higher" than any worker that's already in that spot. You do this by stacking power under your worker until you achieve sufficient height. Your personal buildings can also be powered either by workers or by energy.

In the game you are mostly gathering resources (plastic, steel, oil, money, science tokens, etc.) to do various things, like build buildings and acquire energy dice (the main way of generating power). There's a few other things you can do, like trade goods, get money, hire a worker (which you won't do much), look ahead to see what events are coming up, clean up pollution and advance on the nation track (which is just returning some special set of goods particular to your country to go up on a track... only one person can make it to the last spot, so it's a bit of a race.)

At the beginning of your turn you roll your engergy dice to see how much power you get. You can also spend an oil to get a temporary brown energy die. You sum up all the energy numbers on the dice and take pollution equal to whatever is shown on the die with the higher number (usually one).

Pollution is a game timer, so even if you don't take one during the energy production phase (which happens if you have more eco-friendly dice like the blue hydro-electric die), one pollution always gets discarded. If you do take one, it must be placed on your personal board in the air, ground or water. Later on at the end of the round you'll be scoring for one of those areas, so choosing well (or peeking at the future event card) is worth some points. Pollution is negative points at the end of the game, and there's some bonuses if you keep the furthest columns pollution free.

Once you have your energy, you place a worker on the main board, do that thing and then trigger all your own buildings you want/can. Workers and energy are committed until you decide to pull back your workers on a subsequent turn, at which point all the energy is discarded and the workers come home. As workers on the main board force other players to spend energy to place in that spot, the timing of this can be crucial. If you have two leftover workers/energy when you pull your guys home, you can claim a bonus tile which gives you points for various different things (usually having x).

A large part of the game is about building buildings, which give you points, some special ability and sometimes pollution. Build your buildings with an eye towards combos.

Each round ends when the pollution stack for that round runs out. The game stops after that turn and a new event card is revealed. There's some bonus/penalty that happens and then some area (sky/ground/water) is scored. After the sixth round the game ends.

The game was interesting. It wasn't a huge wow for me, but there's something worth playing there.

First couple of plays, exactly what I hoped it would be: a heavy-ish but not too long worker placement game that plays well with two. (Although two or three more dummy workers moving through the locations automatically might not hurt in the 2p game.) What I hadn't realized is how brilliantly the theme would be carried out--though that's not a huge deal to me, it's still quite clever.

Couple more plays: Lowering from 10 to 9 because the United Nations thing seems tacked on and over-weighted. But that's really a quibble, and this is a great game, a dazzling design from the thematic point of view. I'll have a better understanding of some of the balance of the mechanisms after more plays, the ranking may go up or down.

Initial impressions after 1 play:

I Prefer this one to the original Manhattan Project. It gets rid of the aggression, has a better worker placement mechanic, and a better theme having to balance energy and pollution and in this case it makes for a better game.

The original Manhattan Project has bombers and espionage mechanics that add some diplomacy and in-your-face elements to game, but it gets annoying after a while to watch the buildings you paid for either get continuously blown up or squatted on by other players turn after turn. It makes the game feel like a randomized engine builder.

Energy Empire has minimal interaction comparatively, but if I wanted mean player interaction there are tons of other games that I'd rather play to capture that atmosphere.

Worker placement tableau-building game with lots of interesting decisions (and dice), Need to manage when to recall workers.  Worker spaces are never "Full", but require additional workers (or energy) to be used.  The temporary "Energy" workers add a unique twist.  Points Salads, lots of avenues to victory.  Managing the amount and location of your pollution.  Thick punchboard counters/workers/energy are obviously high quality, but my only complaint (with is really minor) is that I wish they had been wooden meeples.  Still extremely good value.  Great game.

Worker placement and tableau builder of energy conversion.  Stand alone sequel with some familiar but mostly new game play.  Following the threat of nuclear war, countries now focus on economic growth and United Nations leadership powered by a growing demand for energy with escalating pollution.  Objectives reward being green.  Action selection is the signature element of this game. Increased stacks of workers with energy can use an already selected action. Selecting an action type activates buildings in your tableau with more workers and/or energy--This is an engaging strategy puzzle that quickly highlights the need for power.  When exhausted its time to generate energy with oil and resource dice. Countdown pollution timer triggers end game. Not much interaction. Startup country roles don't feel very thematic, just a way of randomly determining starting resources and a conversion action.  I like that global events can be peaked at ahead of time.  Thematically predicting an impending problem while mitigating randomness.

RATING: 8.5
Pros:
Rulebook is excellent. I read it, understood it, there were very few questions from the group, any questions were clearly explained if we had to look them up.
Playtime is quick. 3 players, with rules and teaching was just about 1.5 hours. With a group who has played I imagine you get it to an hour easy.
Downtime is short. I played with our resident AP player. Even with that, and I'm normally not this guy, I ended up saying "Oh, it's my turn already?" quite a few times.
Even with a quicker game, it's full of interesting decisions. There are a ton of options, you can't do everything, so you're always trying to figure out what's most efficient thing you can do.
Components are nice. Even with the retail edition you get little oil barrels and little steel beams. No boring wooden cubes here. The art is clean with lots of text reminders and iconography in the different locations to help remind you how things work.
And I actually made an engine! The worst thing about certain engine builders is they end too soon. Despite losing I still felt like I had something going by the end of the game.
No rounds. This is similar to the original MP, but it's worth noting because it's unique. There is no tradition rounds here. Each player is working in their own phases. The phase you are in dictates if you are adding workers or withdrawing them and gaining energy. Deciding which phase you should be in at what time adds to the depth.

Cons:
Limited player interaction. While not quite multiplayer solitaire blocking other players comes at the risk of making your engine less efficient. While you can do it, it also could hurt you.
It's not new. While this particular game is new, it's not doing much outside of what has been done before. It's refining and streamlining other mechanics found in other games very well, but it's not revolutionary.
Might eventually start to feel samey? With limited interaction and a lot of actions you can normally do regardless of what else is going on, after a dozen plays I wonder how samey the game will feel. There are a ton of different cards/structures here and we didn't even touch half of them, but I'm curious how differently those different structures alter the game.

Additionally, while the worker+energy thing to use occupied spaces is a plus over other worker placement games, I found it to be a bit fiddly when it was time for your generate action because you had to then separate your workers and your energy. The achievements were nice and I liked how many there were, but capping them at 5 VP's each seems arbitrary, and probably only exists to keep someone from 100% focusing on oil or energy or unpolluted spaces. Why not let people experiment and go all-in with something?

The engine building is satisfying when you can perform lots of actions in a turn. With 2 players the game doesn't feel very tight. By the end I feel like I've done everything and I'm just buying buildings for points.

Played twice at Gen Con 2015. First game was four-player, finished close second; second game, 2-player with Luke, got my ass kicked :)
Really enjoyed, lots of decisions, lots of replayability. Best new game I played at the Con

As far as worker placement goes, one of my favorite titles. The personal board with the pollution markers is a great mechanic.

Worker placement game in the same universe of Manhattan Project, but with slightly different mechanics; there is now a mechanic for when you retrieve workers from the board -- which is rolling dice.

Your a company building industry, but the game rewards you for having a clean environment of water, air and sea tiles not being covered up by pollution tokens which also act as a timer for the game.

The game is quite solitaire in nature, you never attack your rival players; the only exception is when you go to the main board and could spend/use energy to make worker placement spots more expensive; but all that really does is make them delay their actions, it slows them down.

I liked the whole engine building, and the different types of buildings, industries and combos.

Other than the down time might be a bit too much for new players, the game is reasonably quick and one must be aware of when each phase is ending as it can be very quick.

Update: 26-Aug-2017.   I've had it with this game at 5 players; the downtime is too much; there's no way I'm waiting 10-15 minutes for it to get back to you before you take an action; you're not involved in anybody else's turn, the whole game is multi-player solitaire with the only conflict in taking worker placement spots.

No longer willing to play with 5 players; and I'm not even sure the game does anything at all for me; go here do something do something else; or wait you've ran out of workers, wait 10-20 minutes before it gets back to you; rinse and repeat.

Overall, 6.0

Such a fantastic game, plays very well with 2 players, you can choose to play non-conflicting or do things to screw with your opponent and both ways are satisfying. The theme really resonates and the tension is good. Takes a few plays to get the rules down, but once you do most games are tight till the end.

Had an unusual chance (due to holidays) to buy and play this new game 5 times in short time period. It is everything they say - perfect engine builder with not so usual turn structure (without rounds), sound theme, variable viable goals and strategies, medium heavy, very short and very satisfying... It is the perfect modern euro game, blend of course, nothing particularly innovative, but fine tuned, top notch product.

There is only one minor problem: mini euro size cards for structures kill the theme a little bit because very nice art and structure names are barely visible. Of course, if they had been bigger that would require more table space, bigger board and probably higher price, but the game already takes a decent amount of table space so...

Other problems are not by any means objective... it's just that I wasn't wow-ed by the game. It was one of my most anticipated games and one of very rare interesting games this year (compared to 2015 and reviewers propaganda aside)... I wasn't "over-expecting" because I got acquainted with every detail before buying. It just didn't give me tinglings as say Marco Polo, just mere satisfaction... It kinda shows through the fact that I cannot say anything about the game that wasn't already said in reviews by Rahdo, Man vs. Meeple, Dice Tower and so forth. 

It definitely is the best engine builder of its length and such a nice, flawless blended product (and I am not the one to look for particular innovations - Marco Polo, also a blend, satisfies me perfectly)... 

I'm writing all of this only to somehow justify to myself not giving it a 10... and I don't really know why...

Played this game for the first time this weekend, had to own it. Resource management, world building, luck and skill all combine to make an amazing game! Despite the multiple parts and complex look, game play is very smooth and clear after one round. The different starting countries and victory objectives make for great replay value. Managing your production, environment, citizens, energy, and U.N. status make for multiple victory paths and strategies. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking to add an advanced board game to their rotation.

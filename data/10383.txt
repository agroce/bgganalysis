Takes every element of Risk 2210 and changes it for the worse. The only use for this game is to make kick-ass protoypes!

Interesting variation on the game but ultimately suffers from the same flaw that most if not all games that have the RISK logo on the box have.
Being able to sweep across in this case an entire continent in one turn.
Better than a huge chunk of the entire planet I suppose.

People seem to like to dislike this game, but it was great to play with my somewhat precocious nine-year-old son. He was lukewarm at first, but when he started trouncing me in turn two or three, he exclaimend, "Wow, Dad, this is really fun!"

[i]Posted: 4/6/2007, Rated: 7[/i]

The short version: despite all of its bells and whistles, there is no escaping the fact that this game is still [i][thing=181]Risk[/thing][/i].  If you have worked yourself up into a frenzy decrying its dicefest battles, then you can stop reading now.  You won't like [i]Risk: Godstorm.[/i]

The long version: [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i] feels like Avalon Hill's attempt to create an "inba" (in between) title that fits between [i][thing=181]Risk[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i]  The idea of ancient cultures and mythological gods clashing is an enticing one.

The map on the main board is of Europe, the Mediterranean, and North Africa.  It lacks the ocean colonies of [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i]  The separate playing board for the moon has become the Underworld.  Spaces in the Underworld aren't counted when allocating armies and faith points (the currency of [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i]).  Therefore, there are fewer territories overall.

The space stations in [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i] are now Temples.  A slight change here is that at the beginning of your turn, each Temple that you control provides one army [i]and[/i] one faith point.  Space stations yielded a single army.  Conquering three territories in [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i] earns a card, as opposed to a card and a unit of energy as in [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i]  Purchasing cards costs two faith points instead of one energy.  These seemingly small variations result in a game that feels very cash-strapped in comparison.

Commanders have become Gods, and their numbers have been reduced from five to four.  Their corresponding card decks are absolutely [i]brutal![/i]  One card allows you to sink an entire continent!  Their viciousness means players will have to be spending money to resummon their Gods quite often.  It also means that a game of [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i] can have wild fluctuations.  A minor quibble: the scoreboard from [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i] is missing in [i]Risk: Godstorm[/i].  It was a nice touch in the heavier game.

[i]Risk: Godstorm[/i] succeeds as the "inba" game it was designed to be.  It has great flavor, proven mechanics that were introduced in [i][thing=1829]Risk 2210 A.D.[/thing][/i] and a reduction in overall complexity.  My enjoyment and my rating fall in between the other two games as well.

[i]Updated: 8/29/10, Rated: 6[/i]

[i]Risk: Godstorm[/i] is still an improvement over its progenitor, [i][thing=181]Risk[/thing][/i].  Like its subject material, it hasn't been able to withstand the test of time and the rise of new ideas.

Second game of Risk ever.  Not a terrible game in my opinion, I might have enjoyed it when I was younger (duking it out with large armies and cool powers and stuff), but given the choices I have now, I would rather play other war games (struggle of empires/conquest of empire).  And to nullify this opinion completely, I'm starting to think traditional world conquest games are just not my piece of pie.

Let’s be frank: as fun as it used to be back in the days, Risk is now quite boring.

So it’s not a surprise that Godstorm is even less enjoyable, as it betrays Risk’s original formula: as a metter of fact you don’t play to crush the other players anymore but to scrape together as many points as you can, as though you were playing some boring eurogame.

As far as theme and gameplay go, it’s just a fantasy-flavored mixture of peoples from different ages, led by the same yet differently named gods whose use isn’t as prominent as the title would suggest: besides, turns are everlasting and there’s only five of them, which means you have only five chances to attack your neighbours. 

To make everything worse half a game revolves around an almost useless struggle for hell’s domination that is too long, cramped and almost useless towards the main game.

There’s no need to play Godstorm as long as Risk is still around: the original game is so much better.

Similar in style of play to RISK: 2210, this variant introduces Gods (a kind of leader for armies) and territories in the underworld as well as fighting across a map of Ancient Europe. Magic also plays an important part and is employed by expending "faith" points. It all sounds good, but, for some reason, doesn't come across with nearly as much fun as either RISK: 2210 or RISK: LOTR.

RATING: 7
Nice version of risk, seems to work with 3 which is good too. If you don't like the basic mechanics of Risk this won't change your mind - but I like it. Fixed turn length (although there is a card to extend it by 1) and it builds to an interesting end game, 'money' (faith) is very tight and you can get swings in fortune (but it's risk, what did you expect?). Like the theme and the fact that eliminated units go to the underworld to fight again.

This game ROCKS! My favourite Risk game so far, excluding Axis & Allies.Some say too complicated, I say BETTER. The most interesting twist to this game is that when your units die, they're not instantly removed from play, but ascend to their 'heaven' on a separate gameboard, and can now battle for the underworld. Each team has four Gods which can be placed in armies to give them various combat bonuses, aswell as having various 'miracle cards' associated with each of them. These can be played to provide a myriad of effects from defensive to strategic to offensive to just plain annoying! The 5-epoch game system makes for an interesting game element, beckoning the unavoidable 'bidding for turn sequence' feature. An all round bloody classic, this game is a must-have for any board-gamer and his family.

Some minor changes for the better from risk like... Auctions? OK... Or event and action cards? Yeah, they're pretty fun. How about a battle for the underworld where you fight with all of your dead units? Now we're talking! But aside from it all, we were still all crushed by someone in one turn doing the classic risk strategy of "sweep the whole board with one giant pile of dudes." Reminded me of why I don't play risk anymore.

This is almost just a re-themed Risk 2210. After one play, however, I think I may enjoy this version better. It's slightly less complex (ie 4 Gods vs. 5 commanders) but the game play is very similar. The Heaven/Hell (in place of the moon) is a nice twist as well.  It may be that I've out played 2210 and this is new, but I like it!

This would be a good option if you like Risk and are lookng to purchase one of the many other versions out there.

RATING: 6
Individual army pieces are well constructed and lots of fun to arrange in formations with my son--only to roll 'divine tennis balls' at them and see which ones fall down.  Great fun!

Another fun one is 'family snake attack' where we take some plastic snakes and drop them on the unsuspecting armies.  Only the elephants tend to fare well in this encounter...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.25
It's the best risk game I've played (haven't played 2210 yet), but that's not saying terribly much.  It's dice, dice, and more dice.  The new options seem cool, but don't work as well as I had hoped.  The whole underworld thing seemed cool, but it has very little impact on the outcome of the game, and it takes a long time to resolve.  There's also a lot of down time between turns, especially late in the game.  It's another not-so-hot Risk game...

A good, if worse, alternative to Risk 2210 A.D. Fun with its ancient mythology theme. Some of the cards are powerful, to the point of breaking the game. Hard-core strategists are likely to be enraged by the card "The Siren Calls."

I enjoy 2210 A.D risk a bit more.  But this is pretty satisfying as well.

As much as I love regular Risk, the addition of Gods and the miracle cards really changes the dynamics of the game for the better.

The underworld is an interesting addition, but most times I've played it has been left out due to bogging down the game. Also, for the number of guys going onto that board, they made the spaces WAY too small.

A Risk-variant set in the ancient world. Play as the Greeks, the Egypts, the Babylonians, the Norse or the Celts and use your four Gods and magic cards to conquer the world. You win by points (each territory is 1 point, plus continental bonuses).

A new Risk game featuring ancient civilizations, four of their gods, heaven, the underworld, and decks of gods cards that range from weeny to cataclysmic!  The game plays well, but the strategy rapidly goes out the window as the number of players increase.  The confined nature of the board and powerful cards certainly give this game an "epic" feel.  A larger underworld board would have been nice.  Not bad, if Risk is your thing.

Good condition.  Played twice.  I'm not a fan of the risk combat system to begin with, and Godstorm adds even more randomness.  The flaw with a lot of Risk variants is that the player that gets the last action gets a huge advantage, as they can spread out in a normally unsustainable manner and not be punished.

I really like this game, certainly more than regular risk. For one thing there's a set END of the game, which Risk desperately needs. Secondly there are Gods! And cool powers! And an underworld where the dead fight! And god battles! Plus there's Atlantis... and you can sink it! Same basic rules of risk but all the extra makes it a whole new, amazing game.

Basically a rethemed Risk 2210, but with a bigger chaos factor due to a wider range of card effects, and an underworld sub-game that at least partly mitigates the runaway leader problem.  Sadly, the underworld map is too small, and the effects of controlling the underworld aren't enough to have a major impact on most games, thus the underworld really isn't that interesting and just serves to bog down the game. Still, minor complaints aside, this is a solid addition to the Risk universe, and the graphical presentation is top notch. Whether this or 2210 is the better Risk game for you will mainly depend on your taste in theme.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Big, loud, brash--Risk that plays much more quickly and is just all around fun.  The bits for this game are gorgeous, probably only rivaled by those found in War of the Ring.

Similar to Risk 2210, this one is much more chaotic and REALLY feels like you're throwing around the will of the gods with powerful miracle cards that can change the game in an instant.

Some complain about the power of these cards, but I like how most of them help counter the two prevailing Risk strategies.  One is the "uber-army", and the swappers and direct damage cards help with overcoming your opponent's 10-stack with 2 gods in support.  The other is the ability to pick off a territory with a lone unit...I've always hated the "trail of onesies" that most games of Risk encourage, this time it's too dangerous.  My first game I fell into that trap, sweeping through Germania and leaving behind a trail of onesies.  BOOM--card gets played that hits one of every unit in each territory on a continent.  All my work to try and control Germania undone in an instant...and all I would have had to do to protect against it would be to keep an extra couple of soldiers here and there.

Not perfectly balanced by any means, but I was pleasantly surprised with this one and will gladly play when the opportunity arises.

I have to credit Risk: Godstorm for introducing me to "modern" board games. There are lots of unique elements that improve the traditional Risk experience, such as bidding on turn order and an economy based on temples and faith to purchase gods and their powers. Unique terrain includes mountain ranges that cannot be transversed, an underworld that serves as a secondary battleground and Atlantis, which can be sunk. When Godstorm first came out, I would give it an 8/9, but these days it is hard to get to the table. Everyone should try to play it at least once, if only to see how it has influenced other modern board game designs.

RATING: 8
Fun Variant of Risk. My biggest problem with this game is that once you are losing, it seems like there is no way to come back because of the turn orders. You have to bid on turn order and roll on ties. But if you have no faith you can't bid so if you are in last place, you tend to not have much to no faith and end up going last and just getting beaten. Also the God Of War Deck seems way to unbalanced. It has a lot of card with no cost that do a lot and then have some that cost lots of faith but don't do much. Overall good but ruthless game that could use some more balancing.

RATING: 6.9
Kids and I played this to death. It looks great, and we like the fighting and territorial take over element from normal Risk, with the added interest of all the gods and the different looking map. Though sometimes the power of certain cards and the element of luck can really grate on me, especially when a powerful card is played when you're just about to win. Saying that, we have had some great games that have taken over many a long afternoon when its 40 degrees outside. The timing mechanism also keeps the game under two hours or maybe a little longer.

Good varient of Risk.  Game mechanics are alot like 2210.  Gods are similar to commanders; command cards are similar to miracle cards; faith tokens are like energy tokens, devastated lands are similar to plague areas; games lasts 5 rounds; territory cards are not collected for reinforcements.  I am surprised when I see reviews that trash Godstorm and praise 2210.
The underworld does slow up the game but can be easily removed with a few house rules added to keep the God of Death interesting.

Probably worse than standard Risk all things considered.  But the amount of random destruction that the cards can bring will cause several players to rage over the game and quit with gusto, possibly throwing over the table.

An interesting versionsof Risk in many ways which initially I hated and put to one side to never touch again as it can be at times extremely chaotic and the best laid out plans can be shattered in a split-second (in general by the extremely powerful cards).

Nowadays I see it as a valuable addition in my board game collection as it provides newbies with a level playing field as all the advantages of certain tactics or knowledge of rules by frequent players are easily offset with a powerful card.

So in my humble opinion a very good introduction for newbies to Risk; After 3-4 hours they walk away with a sense of 'I was in the game and dictated the outcome' rather than 'I was a run-on for hours'.

Fun Risk variant that rewards luck more than skill, and so is good to play with kids.  I really enjoyed the treatment of the theme.  I liked that you can seek to dominate Atlantis only to have it sink underneath you, and I thought the addition of the Underworld made for an interesting twist (warriors who die in battle go there, so early on a player who suffers more losses can at least dominate the Underworld).  The Labor (Miracle) cards are very powerful, so expect your plans to get foiled by opponents' gods; I like that cards can be purchased or earned.  All in all a fun variant.

Love this game!  Best risk game I've played.

Have only played game once, but it was the best gaming memory of my life.  Best friend (arch enemy in all games) put EVERYTHING on Atlantis Island then drew the Sink Atlantis card. He showed us the card bragging how Atlantis could NEVER be sunk now that he had this card. I thanked him for letting me know he had the card and IMMEDIATELY played my card (STEAL 1 CARD FROM ANY PLAYER & PLAY IMMEDIATELY). We still laugh about that one:)

Ebay purchase, one of the first few games I bought, which started the gaming craze. Sold on BGG '10.

Enjoy this game with rules more similar to 2210 A.D. house rules, probably my favorite map next to LOTR Risk

Quality rating: 6
Willingness to play rating: 5
Fun rating: 5

The map is great, but how the gods fight and the underworld are pretty lame, in fact the underworld takes up a lot of time that could help the game move faster and smoother. Good idea though.

Weak Risk variant.

Messy/underdeveloped underworld.

Random/too powerful cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This risk variant suffers from the problems that all dice games suffer from, but Risk is an institution and there is a place and time for dice-fests. I like this one because of the power cards and the theme. Also the after life board allows for a few small twists but not enough to win the game for a player, rather to serve as a tie breaker and spice up the turn actions. Disapointed that solid Risk strategy can be completely undermined by a single card, so for deep thought I'd still go back to LotR or classic Risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I think I've only gotten to play this once, but I'd play it again. (Preferably with 3 or 4; I don't think it would be any good with 2, and it went a little long with 5, but that may just be because my friends are slow; see my session report.)

My main objection is the amount of downtime; this kind of game has a lot of sitting around waiting for your turn.  But, hey, sometimes it's OK to kick back, relax, and shout at your friends to hurry up.

Update: no... no, it's never OK to kick back, relax, and shout at your friends to hurry up.  Those bastards are just too damn slow; I don't have the patience.

The best Risk I've played. Satisfies my occasional beer-n-pretzels war-boardgame yen. God powers added in with the beer and pretzel mix. Play only for fun, do not take seriously, and not deeply.

If you think about this game, that's too much. Risk is to Crap what Godstorm Risk is to Fun.

If you missed out on your chance to buy this game - so what? Don't worry about it. I'm thinking too much about this game; end.

Another good Risk variant.  I actually think I prefer Godstorm to 2210AD, ...though I can never seem to put my finger on exactly why.  The Underworld is an underdeveloped add-on; it doesn't really play a major role in the game, but it doesn't necessarily detract from the experience either.

Although I didn't know it at the time, this game was my first foray if you will into Euro Gaming. They redisigned classic RISK into something more akin to Euro Games. There are Epochs which you progress through instead of all out annhialation (which you can still play). This is a very interesting and fun adaptation involving an Atlantis country that can sink (along with every soldier on it), Gods that grant certain abilities to your soldiers, and an Underworld (Hades) board that your troops are sent to upon death; but which they can battle out of to come back! 
Very fun.

I'm not a risk lover. Played it tons in the past, got tired of it... But this was fun. It's only one game, about 3 hours long. But this one, with players who know the game, can easily be played in 2hours. Nice twist for bidding for turn. Having spells that could change the world in one turn, and the underworld are nice twist. It's making me think about getting or at least, playing the other risk game variant. Might move to a 7!

My playgroup really enjoys this version of Risk and it is frequently on our shortlist to hit the table.  The gods and their powers you can buy for them really make the game a different experience each time you play and help make it easy to forget you are actually playing "Risk".  Easily my second favorite Risk variant right behind LOTR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My favorite of the Risk variants. I think, with only a few small flaws, it builds on successful ideas used in Risk 2210 and makes for a fun, flavor-filled game that feels like Risk but also feels like something much more. It's got a lot of strategy, a lot of style and really does make it feel like you're a God controlling ancient armies when you play.

UPDATE: I still love this game but am considering getting rid of it because there are just so many other conquest games that are tighter, more fun, and more interesting. This one is still great but it has all the same faults as Risk for the most part.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Takes the decent game of Risk and adds a ton of flavor and godly and undead warfare. I think the game could have been improved by giving the different pantheons of gods unique powers. Since the game is limited to five rounds it can't go on forever like some classic Risk games (a plus imo).

This is not your typical RISK game. It has a very unique feeling (being set in a world of mythology with gods walking the earth. It's very cool). The use of gods to boost your armies is a great addition and the miracle cards adds a great diversity to the game, although when you buy miracle cards you tend to go for magic Items, since they are permanent effects and are typically very useful. The greatest difference is the use of the underworld. So your soldiers die, let them conquer the underworld and some of them may actually come back to life. The only real annoyance in the game is that it only lasts for five turns, but you can always decide to play more turns. So if you like RISK play this game. If you don't play it anyway. You'll be surprised how great it is.

I hate Risk! So in hindsight it was probably a mistake buying this. It is better than Risk, with a much improved endgame, but it still plays like Risk and we found little opportunity to use the extra additions such as Miracles.

Some of the cards are weird but hey... i guess the gods are just that powerful.  It's kicking risk up a notch.  Great game if you like screwing people that you don't like by making a pact with them and then backstabbing them when they are weak.

I want to play this game more but it doesn't get much game play.

Several games through and still it's one of the first games I reach for if there's a few people around.

The ancient world is up for a fight, and even when your armies die they still fight in the afterlife in the hope of resurrection back to terra firma, for more fighting!

The rules are a little sketchy in places and it would have been nice if the miniature gods had been personalised a bit more. Also Celt vs Egyptian?

But it is only a game and as games go it's fun and frustrating in equal measure - as RISK can be. Spending a whole turn to get hold of a whole region only for your opponents to then rob you of your prize 5 army or the 20 armies that get decimated against an army  of 3, just because the dice like the number 1.

Luck based yes but fun - definately!

If you can get your hands on a copy you shouldn't be disappointed and if you are you're playing it wrong.

RATING: 8
The best version of Risk out there, as far as I'm concerned.  The gameplay still suffers from a large amount of dice-rolling, and someone will be forced to try to develop an indefensible continent if you are playing with enough people.  The Underworld requires a lot of maintenance and is generally useless, and the Magic cards are vastly overpowered.

Having said this, the gods and god cards make strategizing more fun, and Atlantis sinking is a neat addition.  The layout of the board is probably the best out of any Risk versions I've seen, and the randomized plagues ensure that each game is different.

Risk: Godstorm is definitely worth a play if you are a fan of Risk.

Very similar gameplay to Risk 2210. Different theme, and frankly, not quite so well balanced. The underworld is interesting, but doesn't seem as relevant as the moon usually winds up being in 2210. It also gets extremely crowded by the end of the game; could've used a bigger mini-board. That being said, you gotta love being able to sink Atlantis.

RATING: N/A
Purchased for my friends who prefer something with a title that they can (somewhat) recognize.

Update:  After (most of) one game played, and definately playing it incorrectly, it's hard to jump to conclusions on this.  It has the skeleton of R:2210 but with the facade and theme of ancient europe.  I'm very likely to play this game more often as its the only title that contains the word 'Risk' and many of my non-gaming friends are asking me for games with the word 'Risk' in them. (in a roundabout way)

Update: I just gave it to the friend.  Enjoy.

I like this game along with Risk 2210 much much better than original.  This one incorporates use of Gods, Underworld and Miracle Cards quite well for some fun, interesting, and thematic play. Agree with some of the comments regarding the power of some of the cards, however being aware of their power does provide some planning opportunity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Beautiful game, which is the first thing you'll notice.  WOnderful colors, pieces, etc.  It's neat because it has all the normal mechanics of Risk, but it is also very different.  You only get five turns (so it doesn't take long), and the Gods, Faith points/cards, and the underworld all make this a very interesting twist of Risk.  The super scaled in board takes some getting used to, like LOTR risk.  And sinking Atlantis is great fun.

Another good themed Risk variation. Like 2210 A.D. I enjoyed the addition of the gods and the cards. However "Hell" is far too small, especially when 3-5 players are playing, and the rules regarding hell aren't very clear. Otherwise fun game.

RATING: 5
One of the better editions of Risk. Introduced God powers and a separate board for the underworld, which had the cool consequence of the death of your troops allowing you more chance to vie for control of Hades. It's still Risk though so it couldn't really hold up to newer more interesting game designs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I find this game very enjoyable.  It takes basic risk and adds a big chaos factor in the God cards.  The Gods themselves also help out in battles adding more variety to the game.  I would cost temples at 3 tokens, not 5 as in the rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I like Risk. I like the theme of Godstorm and enjoyed the mechanics of 2210. Unfortunately, not enough time was given to developing the game. Faith is too scarce, the cards are to powerful resulting in a chaotic mess. There should have been a better balance between the powers and the amount of money as a single card (drawn at random) can radically change the game. In a game that only lasts five turns this is not acceptable. In addition to that, the Underworld is useless until the last turn of the game. Why don't Underworld territories count toward reinforcements? It replicates the Moon in 2210 but offers nothing toward your territory count. Consider playing 2210 and not counting the Moon each turn! Would anyone ever bother? I firmly believe they rushed this game for some reason. The mechanics and theme are there but the game play is flushable.  

If you play just the conquest game (eliminate the cards, gods, etc), basically original Risk on a different map, then I would rate the game an 8.

6 - For a while this was a frequent game, a new map that's fairly well balanced, and has a cool theme made for a nice change from classic risk.

We didn't play with points, and we rarely used the turn counter so our games ran too long and became less and less fun.

Also whoever decided that two of the five colors should be yellowish-orange and orangish-yellow should be fired.  I spray painted the more orange ones black.

A risk variant with some potential, but also deeply flawed. Where to start?
At the rules - the ones in the game are ABYSMALLY written, chatty but NOTHING about the set up and game play is highlighted! Download the field manual if you want to understand how to play the game.
The concept behind the gods and the god's cards are interesting even though it adds a lot of random events, it provides the welcome addition from standard risk. It is what gives the this risk variant its interest.
The underworld is also a decent concept but seems to not be completely implemented.
It does suffer the problem from the rich get richer since both faith and armies are continent controlled dependent. I would like to see faith and the underworld to be more of a catch up mechanism.
Some ideas I'll try out:
+2 faith if you don't control a continent. (balance out controlling a small continent).
+1 faith for each alter in the underworld (make stronger assumption who has a lot of units there is weak aboveground).
Start with 1 temple (capital) cannot attack capital the first turn. (can't get eliminated the first turn).
Start with 1 god your choice.
(Deploy these after deploying all armies).
(Showing how badly the rules are formated, I completely missed the fact that the game setup includes a temple and the war god at the start.
Death god - preventing armies going to heaven occurs on both offense and defense.

I like this old world, Risk spin-off.  The board has less places to hide than the original, and the limited amount of turns encourages constant combat.  The gods and artifacts are a neat twist, and certain powers placed in the right area can drastically alter the game.  Plus, dead troops battle for control of the underworld and possible rebirth.  What's not to like?

About equal to 2210.  Better than regular Risk in that there is much more to the game than just rolling dice.  The 5 turn limit is great, but that damn "turn back time" card or whatever really sucks when you're just about to wrap up turn five, and all of a sudden it's back to the beginning of turn 4 :(.  Still a pretty long game at 2-3 hours, which is mainly why it gets the rating it does.

This game has great quality pieces and is so rich with theme; in this case western mythology. My group found the rules too convoluted so created alternative Secret Mission rules which keep the fun elements while reducing the upkeep. The Underworld was the first thing to go. I appreciate a game that comes loaded with minis and counters and allows you to modify rules to suit your own preferred level of complexity. Very easy to house rule. My alternative rules are saved in the Files section. My only gripe with this game is that there are only 2 types of figure whereas most Risk games will provide 3. I wish they had provided chariots to go with the warriors and elephants.

The good thing about this game is that it's only five rounds long. The bad thing is that the rules are fairly complicated. These days, when we feel the need to wage war with each other, we tend to play Kemet or Cyclades. Godstorm has a very nice theme, though.

Played once and I'd like to play again. Seems considerably different from Risk 2210 with the different map, commanders, command cards, and the underworld map.

While I'd like to play it again, the gameplay the first time didn't really draw me in. It seems clunkier than Risk 2210 A.D. I could see myself trading it as I have so many other games in this genre that I enjoy more such as Risk 2210 A.D., Nexus Ops, and Risk: Halo Wars. 

I am interested in it because of the great pieces, the power cards, and the chance to sink Atlantis beneath the waves.

I'm not quite grasping the whole underworld section to the game.

I can see this going to the trade pile.

RATING: 4
I was super excited when I got this game.  In execution however, it doesn't seem to play that great.  It's not broken, but for a game called 'Godstorm', there was very little actual godstorming going on.  In order to play cards affiliated with the corresponding god, you have to keep them alive.  In order to keep them alive, you really have to keep them away from the front.  If you keep them away from the front, you never have gods facing off from eachother.  Losing a god in battle is too expensive to recover as you want to spend that money, 'faith', on cards which are way more useful.  Kinda sucks.  The Underworld, which sounds really cool as the more you lose on the overworld the more powerful you are in the underworld, just ends up being a back and forth see-saw with very little strategy involved, just more dice rolling.  It's a different spin on Risk, but I would recommend Risk 2210 AD well before this one.

I don't hate risk--I just find it tough to love.  This game is a bit less tough to love, but I still don't really care for it.  The best strategy can still get utterly demolished by dumb luck (and it's usually the person at the table with the least skill who has the most luck...for that reason alone, it's entertaining to watch, I suppose...).  Greater dynamics, brings currency into the game, but it is yielded on a 1:1 ratio with troops (and luck dictates how many of these you get too, since it's all in how many countries you take over).  The temples and gods aspect is intriguing, and the board is cool.  I also like the factor of the cards...but, at its heart, you're really still playing RISK with different window dressing and bits that are even fiddlier than the original ones.

It's a mess. Did not enjoy this at all. The black sheep in my game collection. Will never ever play again

I found this game to be WAY too short. And the Temple mechanic is useless. Nobody I ever played, or talked to has ever built one. I am a huge risk fan and own all the other versions.

Kim and I thoroughly enjoy this game. Of all the Risk variants out there, this is easily our favorite. It's much maligned by the BGG community (partly just because it's Risk, partly because of the Underworld mechanic), but I think it's good points fra outweight its bad points. It's a beer and pretzels game — not a wargame simulation. It's nice romping around the board for a couple of hours, gods vs. gods, men vs. men, and the occasional sinking of Atlantis. I'm definitely a proud owner of this game.

Good theme play.  Game is easy to learn and play.  Plays somewhat differently from base Risk game.  Army types and combat system is the same, but combat is enhanced with cards, the gods, and temples.  Cards can also effect other aspects of play and have added dimension of the underworld.  Game play still heavily influenced by dice rolls and the cards seem to have very random, powerful events.  The components are excellent - colorful mounted board, plastic playing pieces, and somewhat durable cards with above average artwork.  Rulebook is in color and clear.  Game length is set at 5 turns which seems short, but game time is about 2 hours.

Gameplaywise it was very promising, with the accessible decent Risk wargaming system coupled with God-like powers and nifty cardplay for epic sweeps of warfare.

In reality though, the powers and cards were too unbalanced, chaotic and the game totally fell flat in combination with the luck factor already omnipresent in Risk. Tried it a couple of times before I finally gave up on it.

Glad I managed to sell it off in 2005 already, never regretted this decision.

I love mythology... but firstly, I can say this as someone who has spent many a night having fun, playing Risk until the morning, and Risk definitely supports a "rich get richer" type of gameplay, where once someone gets on top its only a matter of time.  You would think that the intervention of the ancient gods would help out the underdogs... but it doesn't, and the rich just get richer faster.  The only people who have the Faith Points to do anything cool are the people who DON'T need the extra help.  I was also quite disappointed that every pantheon is the same.

An okay Risk variant even if parts of it (especially the Underworld) are woefully underdeveloped. Like all Risk games, it's tough to come back from behind, and even with the shortened game length it can take a while between turns with the full complement of players. Lots of potential here, but just doesn't fulfill.

Have only played a few times.  It's basically Risk on crack, there's some really interesting rules and concepts but ultimately the whole game can just fall apart if one player can get a big enough lead.  We only play this on a whim sometimes to see if it can be fun, but usually it's only fun for one or two people...

While Risk games aren't my particular thing I gave it a shot. The game itself isn't horrible, but the cards seem to be super powered, and there's a definite 'rich get richer' phase of the game. Far from a disaster, and it would be more fun if it played a lot quicker.

A quality Risk varitant.  Better than 2210 but that may be that I just enjoy the theme better.  The games are completely different so then again maybe not.  This game is still driven by the Risk battle system so if you absolutely HATE that you won't enjoy this.

Enter a time of myths and legends. Enter the world of Risk Godstorm, where ancient faiths and fears rule. Battle across the Earth and in the dark regions below. Harness spiritual forces to strike with devastating power. Command five ancient cultures -- Greek, Celtic, Babylonian, Norse, and Egyptian -- in a continent-spanning battle that will determine whose civilization reigns supreme. Rest assured, the gods will not sit idle in this war.

I only played this game once and it was kind of a dissappointement.
Maybe its because it didn't meet my expectations. It bodered me that i couldn't take over the world :-(. I also didnt like the underworld and the reincarnation aspect. Ther is a lot going on in Godstorm. The game also suffers from some downtime, there are a lot of things to do in one turn.
I will give this one another try in the future but for now i am not a fan of Godstorm.
I do like all the components, everything looks very nice.
Also it is possible to play normal Risk with this version.

This isn't a terrible Risk variant. I like how Hasbro has been taking some chances with Risk and introducing new elements into it instead of just changing the art when a new or licensed edition comes out. This has card play and a sideboard, similar to the Risk:2210 rule-set but using slightly different mechanics to utilize them.

I don't think the variants they tried here work quite as well as the ones in 2210, however. The sideboard is a catch up mechanism, as troops that are lost from the main board go here to fight for bonuses. It's supposed to represent the underworld, with the idea that if you were weakened by losing most of your guys on the main board, you would then gain an overwhelming advantage on the bonus board. From there, you could then use those numbers to stage a comeback. It looks really good on paper, but the reality is that the underworld just adds another ten minutes to every turn. Risk already has a reputation for dragging on too long, so this not a good feature.

The mythology aspect is decent, but it would have been far more interesting if the different pantheons didn't have the exact same powers. I guess they were going for simplicity, but a little differentiation would have helped to keep the game from getting stale too quickly. I do like the cards, they add a nice layer of strategy and the one that sinks Atlantis is pure genius. Do I take all those free armies that are just sitting there waiting for me or do I avoid wasting my troops because that continent is going down...and soon because my opponent just drew a card and started evacuating.

There's nothing terribly wrong with Godstorm, but I find myself now owning five different Risk variants. This is the one I find the least fun, because the additions here all make the game last longer without contributing anything I can't live without.

 ancient meditaranian version of risk, lovely bits especially the teeny elephants, inclusion of special abilities form cards and gods as uber units make this osund fun, not to mention the inclusion of an underworld board where dead units fight on in the afterlife.Sadly the cards in my opinion slow down the game and while the underworld is a nice aidea the actual underworld board is woefully small and the whole thing seems rather frivalous and tacked on and could have been better impelented through card play, the good thing about it is teh game can at most last for only 6 turns thus giving it an obtaianble ending

RATING: 8
Really enjoy this version of Risk.  Love the elephants and all the same things I like about 2210 Risk.  The gods really add something interesting but it is a race to see how many permanent god cards you can get before the deck runs out.

RATING: 7.9
A worthy addition to the Risk series.  Plenty of theme and potential to follow different strategies (go for the Miracle cards or push your armies hard).  The off board underworld and potential sinking of Atlantis are nice inclusions.  Similar to Risk 2210 but themed different.

Rate downward quite a bit, this game suffers from serious runaway leader problems.  This is not sour grapes, I have been the runaway leader in question both times I've played this. Numerous other issues, see Ynnen's review, most of it is very accurate. This could have been a good game, but it was very poorly developed.

I enjoyed the game because I won, but it's still Risk.  One of the players was pretty much out after two turns, and sat and watched for the next 90 minutes.  I like the chaos of the cards, and the gods are fun, but again, it's still Risk.  Better than classic Risk, but it still has all of Risk's warts.

For the most part, Godstorm is Risk 2210 AD with a Fantasy theme rather than a sci-fi theme.  The biggest differences are the map (Europe and North Africa) and the Underworld map (replacing the moon map).  The Underworld map is a nice idea, although it impact is minimal and the map should have been printed to a larger scale.  The God cards are a bit less clear and well-written than the Commander cards in 2210 AD.

This game is a good example of a board game that I buy without finding out more about it other then what's on the back of the box! The good news is that now I make sure I know about a game before I put money down for it. The game is ok, but my game group and I play way cooler games then this, so it rearly get's dusted off and used.

More of a sequel to Risk: 2210 than anything else, this has many of the same elements (five turn limit; "unlockable" decks that match certian power figures; credits needed to bid for turn order and pay for cards) this does feature some new wrinkles, mostly an "afterlife" board where dead pieces continue to fight to earn more points or even make their way back to the main board. It's a good idea, but the board is way too small to handle the huge amount of pieces that are going to pile up on it. Also, the god rules aren't quite as elegant as one would hope, with powers that overlap and aren't consistant with with other rules, and that "god labor" idea was a good one, but just try to remember to carry them out over the course of a game. One of the more awkward Risks, but worth it for the completist.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. Godstorm is rife with numerous problems, especially if playing with 5 people. It is a very unbalanced game. In fact, a player can actually be eliminated from the game before they even get a chance to have a turn! The only thing that prevents this from being a 2 or less is the fact that the components are nice looking and fairly high quality.

The theme is really neat I just hate how the underworld seems to drag the game on for far too long and for such little reward.  We plan on making the underworld a lot less boring by adding some house rules that will limit how many troops can actually end up there.

This is a cooler version of risk, but I wouldn't say its leaps and bounds superior to the classic game of world domination. ;p

Risk: Godstorm is pretty good for as far as Risk games goes. I must of played this one about 12-15 times now. After about 6 games underneath my play groups belt we decided to make some house rules for this. 

It was apparent that everybody was going for the god War right away. He's super good with his ability to win ties and his cards are really good and super cheap. So we made him cost 5 instead of 3 and his cards cost one more too. Yes, he is that good. 

The other house rule we done was drop the temple from the 5 cost to 3. Nobody usually bought any and the fear of having them taken didn't help the issue.

RATING: 8.3
In the same realm as Risk 2210 A.D. so it is a great game but there are a few factors that make it not quite as good of a Risk Variation.  Some of the cards are just far too powerful, leaving the game a little bit too much up to luck of the cards.  The sink Atlantis card is just brutal.  Also the map I feel is one of the least balanced Risk maps.  It is alright but it feels very funneled at a few spots.

Adds mythological theme to the base risk. I love the map and I love mythology. The game attempts to solve the problem of player elimination by implementing a limited number of rounds, but that is less than satisfying. Also, the underworld map is way too small and is not balanced for less than 5 players. I usually discard the underworld map and round limit with some house rules and removing some power cards. Overall, better than normal risk but with the same inherent problems that limits normal risk.

RATING: N/A
This was my first real experience with Risk; it's  the base game (from what I've read at least) with Euro mechanics added to it (i.e. bidding for turn order and limiting the game to 5 epochs [rounds]). It unfortunately suffers from a bit downtime (10 actions per player per round all to be executed one after the other), difficult-to-understand instructions, and a useless Underworld (which is where your armies are given one more chance to battle it out when they die) which simply lengthens an already-long game. Though the game board and pieces are great, and the mythological theme adds an interesting feel to it, I'm not particularly sure why it's called a "godstorm" if all of the gods within each pantheon have the same exact powers. I also feel that miracle cards (special cards) are far too expensive making it impossible to go through at least half of the deck meaning you're always basically forced to invade territories each turn. Some might argue that this simply adds variety each time you play, but if this is so, then the Euro theme isn't very well executed nor does it help much to really expand the base game. I'd only recommend it with 5 players if they can all move quickly.

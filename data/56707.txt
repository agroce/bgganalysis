There's nothing broken in this game, except that it is not fun to play. Colonia is a collection of nice mechanics, which sum up much less than their initial value.
1+1+1+1+1+1+1=3

Add some crappy paper money (in four different currencies) and you end up having a "2".

Poor.

If I rated anything a 6.5, this would be it.  It was fun, but for the time it took (3.0-3.5 hours for a 3-player game), I could have played 2-3 better games of similar weight.  The mechanics are right up my alley, and the game is very simple and extremely glossy, but I shudder to think what it would be like to play this with 6.  Don't know if I'll keep it.

Update: Traded away.

One of my favourite games. Even though it's wash and repeat 6 times round it is such a tight game that players used to hardship and dissappointment will really enjoy. Something about this game where you really struggle to get the end result is very satisying when you win, or don't come last. Have not won this yet.

Not as good as Alhambra, but this game has a beautiful presentation and a very interesting turn structure in which the resources and actions of particular turns will continue to affect the next. Ultimately you're trying to get relics in the city of Cologne, which score you VP, and there are many cool steps along the way...voting on edicts, buying resources, contracting those resources to various craftsman, making goods, shipping goods for different currencies, and then using the currencies to acquire the relics...sounds complex, but the flow of play is pretty compelling. Did I mention it looks fantastic?

Coffin sized box, it's a serviceable game that is much like any other, but has a HUGE footprint of table space and isn't terrible by any means. For 4 or more only to be realistic.

RATING: 6
First game was with six players.  There is a lot to like about the design.  Spreading the seven stages over the seven days of the week was clever.  But it is easy to go horribly wrong, in particular to get your family members tied up with Thursday’s craftsmen.  With a bad die roll they can be there for three turns - half the game.

There was a lot of groaning throughout the game, with players unable to do what they wanted.  The lack of available currencies (from the boats) meant several occasions when the relics were simply not acquirable.  Turn order is very important.

Interestingly, all players felt they were doing poorly.  A function of the system where doing things is often difficult.  5 players finished within a point of each other.  Close.  More frustrating than fun, with AP setting in with certain players.  Would play again but would prefer playing many other games instead.

Played collector’s edition.  Is it worth making two editions of the same game?

RATING: 7.5
Colonia is a good game, is fun, and it is nice to look at.  But it does not seem to offer anything really new, and the objective of the game is a bit overcomplicated (get resources to get products to send them in ships to get money, in 4 different currencies, to buy relics which give you points!)
A bit long, also, and not so easy set up in between phases.

RATING: 7.3
A pimped version of before the wind. A respectable pure euro,resource converting triple time,with nothing too exciting to offer.I can't pinpoint what's missing from the game,since strategically it looks robust. Slight changes in the mechanics should offer the boost the game is lacking.

The game looks great but it isn't. You change resources for goods which you ship for money to buy some relics. The whole game you change things for other things. The decretes do not change the gameplay a lot and the planning is very difficult and luckbound.

The worker return mechanism is nice but other than that it's got little appeal for me. Repetitive as there's no progression throughout the game, just repeating the same phases 6 times with no escalation. Too long with 5 or 6 for what it is.

I have been aware of significant 'less than positive' feedback about this game before I played it. The criticism seemed to be that it was too linear and plans were thwarted too easily at the end if the random allocation of artifacts didn't suit your currency.

It was with some trepidation that we started our first game. And now having one play under our belts, I must say the game is no way as bad as I'd been told.

Yes there is a linear aspect to it, and some limited randomness which can aid the undeserving but all in a well engineered strategy will be rewarded 99% of the time. Artifacts from previous rounds can be reserved by placing a meeple on it and you get a glimpse of the next ships to leave port so know whats feasible and whats a risky bet.

All in the criticisms I heard were mostly non specific, lots of wrinkled noses and shrugs. Admittedly this isn't a deep game and is quick to learn, but there is quite a bit to take onboard and planning against the actions of others is key to success.

I'd certainly be happy to play it again.

But 4 years later the game still hadn't got a second play. Its clear this isn't in my top 100 games and so needed to be sold on.

RATING: 5
Long, repetitive and fiddly. It feels like there are two more steps than needed. I'd like the game better if the points you got from shipping added up for your total score instead of converting to money then buying points. Too much going on here than necessary for me. 

About the game:

Here is another worker placement game with some new twists. At it's essence, you place guys to get votes to determine some optional actions later in the round. Then you plan as well as you can with imperfect information to budget your workers, get your goods, reserve your spot on a boat for your goods, get money in the type of currency to purchase points (matching the currency type).

I would like this game much better if you played four weeks instead of 6, but I fear you need the six rounds to balance out the swinggy mechanics. 

I think the game outstays it's welcome, but if you love cube pushing games, perhaps it is worth a try. Definitely try before you buy! 

After three plays and giving it the benefit of the doubt, I'm done with this one.

A good economic game by Queen.  First play, 3 players.  It didn't really take long to get into it as the rules were laid out nicely.  How things tied in took a round.  We all enjoyed this one.  If you are not a fan of having some luck in games like this you might not like it.  At least for me, I liked that part.  You have a general plan but you really need to have a plan B and plan C in mind as you are never certain what part of your plans can go wrong.  I like the worker placement/management part from turn order all the way to being able to ship.  I found this interesting as you can look ahead also with enough randomness that you have to think on your feet.  A solid 7 for me and it could go up after more plays.  I'd like to play with more people...that could be interesting.

Egy rendkívül érdekes mechanizmussal van kitalálva ez a játék. Egy hetet kell átfogni egy körben és 6 kör van. Befolyás szerzése a városházán, alapanyag beszerzés, készáráru vásárlása, majd ezek kihajózása pénzért, mert ezen pénzekből pontok azaz relikviák vásárlása. Bonyolítja, hogy négyféle fizetőeszköz van, attól függően, hogy milyen hajóról jött a bevétel. A relikviák is eszerint választhatóak, úgyhogy előfordulhat, hogy épp olyan pénzünk van, melyből semmit nem tudunk vásárolni. Közben még a befolyás tekintetében lévő szavazás is megbolondítja a köröket. Jól kitalált hangulatos játék.

I should learn to trust my instincts and not get talked into playing a long game I suspect after the first 5 minutes of rules explanation will be a tedious euro. Colonia fits right into that category, and pretty plumage doesn't save it.

Most of what I dislike about euros - no drama, no immersion in theme, no interaction (unless you count beating someone to something as interaction ...) and no real feel of development, each turn is the same thing repeated (and you have to do it 6 times, zzzz).

Not a bad game, just dry as dust, long and dull - why bother?

RATING: 7.5
Es un juego en el que cada jugador representa a una familiar que debe competir con el resto durante seis semanas (turnos), cada uno de los cuales tiene siete fases (días). Es un juego básicamente de gestión de recursos. Hay que conseguir mercancías, transformarlas y embarcarlas para conseguir dinero (cuatro tipos de moneda, recordando un poco a Alhambra, del mismo autor) y con ese dinero conseguir reliquias.

Es interesante el uso de los "miembros  de la familia", que una vez que se utilizan para una fase, no volveran a estár disponibles hasta la fase siguiente del turno siguiente. Hace que tengas que estar pendiente de cuanta gente necesitas. 

Me ha parecido bastante original y entretenido. Le casco un 7.5

Can't quite put my finger on my frustration with the game, but felt hopelessly behind the whole time even though I ended up coming in second.  Should be a game right up my alley - tight worker and resource management, dry dry dry -- but it did not blow my skirt up.  I suspect that I'll like it more the next time I try it now that I have a better idea of what to expect.

We have become so inundated with Puerto Rico/Le Havre type games where you grab one corner of the market and hold on for dear life. THIS game IS different. Yes, absolutely there's luck involved. But this game is about what you do with that luck (good or ill). You have to plan ahead, and hope for the best. There are other games out there just like this - perhaps this one is a little more unforgiving?

I can totally understand where the designer is coming from - a game where you grab what you can, make the most of what you can, and push everyone else out of the way to get any relics you can to make yourself the 'most influential family' in town. This game IS a wolf in sheep's clothing - it has much more bite than you think.
Unfortunately the last turn can be a bit of a letdown. This is my only knock against a very good game.

Colonia looks great on paper, but just has to many layers of goods conversion for it's own good.

a) gain raw materials
b) convert those raw materials to goods
c) ship those goods for specific kinds of money
d) use that money to finally buy relics that are worth points

It all sounds like it will be a cool and interesting puzzle, but you find that so many levels of conversion results in a chaotic game where not much of any forward thinking or planning is possible.  You know something isn't quite right when everyone finishes the game and doesn't know what they could have done differently to do any better.  There are no strategies to pursue here.  You get goods and mash them through a machine, hoping the right combination of stuff falls into place to make them useful in the end.  And to cap it all off, the game just takes too long for what turns out to be an overly-repetitive exercise.

To be fair, there are some cool ideas here.  I really liked the voting, and the workers hanging out on the street before they are freed up to be used again also makes you carefully manage your use of workers.

Overall, I really wanted to like this since it's such a beautiful game.  Unfortunately, it just came up short (or long?) for me.

Een spel dat heel wat planning vereist. Doordat de acties in een welbepaalde volgorde dienen te worden uitgevoerd blijft het relatief eenvoudig. Wel maar 1 manier om punten te scoren (nadeel van de eenvoud): relikwieën verzamelen. Hiervoor is geld van een bepaalde valuta nodig. Deze valuta kunnen bekomen worden door schepen van de overeenstemmende buitenlandse bestemming te bevrachten met specifieke handelswaren. Om deze handelswaren te bekomen, dienen bepaalde combinaties van grondstoffen verzameld te worden. Dit alles gebeurt via het inzetten van familieleden.

RATING: 6
There is a great deal to this game. Seven phases to each round (or whatever it is) each requiring its own level of strategy, while also considering all the future phases in that round and rounds in the game.

So, there is a lot to think about...maybe too much if you're not in the mood.

The production value is great. The board looks terrific and the components are good too.

Why the lukewarm rating then? Well, at the end of the game, maybe 2 hours or more, the winner is the one with the most points. This itself is not unusual. However the problem is the winner might have only 12 points or so, which leaves me feeling unfulfilled for the amount of time I've invested in playing the game. The obvious answer is to multiply all scores by 10 or 100, but it still wouldn't feel quite right.

This is very close to being a very terrific game, but is a bit of a let down at the end.

Players are merchants in medieval Koeln, trying to make money and invest it in holy relics.  The game is played over six weeks (turns), where a seven step sequence of play (Monday to Sunday) is worked through.  Players buy raw goods, pass them to the craftsmen who turn them into products, which get shipped off to four Hanseatic cities for money, which is invested in relics.  Standard turn A into B into C to get D game, full of resource management stuff to ponder.  Good points - looks very nice, plays cleanly, and offers 2 to 3 hours of good thinky fun.  Bad points - it feels an hour too long, very difficult to plan as you are continually butting heads with the other players via the worker placement mechanics, and other games do the same thing better.  For three hours, there are about 30 other games I'd rather play.  Happy to play again if suggested, but not one I need to own.  Fresco does the convert stuff into points in a much more charming, and faster, way.

I really thought the game would of had more meaningful decisions, but it just felt flat for me. Sure, you try to plan your resource chain for the end relic, but in the end, I just ended up grabbing whatever goods were convienient and spent them where they fit. To be fair, I only played it once with three and it lacked tension, but even at the lower player count I got bored halfway through and felt it was about 25% too long.

First of all a gorgeous game.  The board is designed beautifully so that the flow of the game through a round (a week) is not confusing, but instead easy to follow.  It is fiddly with many components, and set up takes a little time.  Victory points are extremely difficult to obtain--6 of us played and the scores ranged from 2-9. I liked playing with 6--the competition for player order and resources, shipping, etc. was fierce.  The mechanics for turn order are different and add a very strategic level to the game.

Worker placement with a time delay release of the previously played workers.  Acquire ressources, purchase goods with these and sell lots of goods to acquire currencies, which ultimately help to gain religious artifacts.  Score is based on the acquired artifacts, so you can't skip a step on the way; the trick is how to balance your workforce.  Brilliant.

Gyönyörű, vicces hangulatú darab. A seftelés, majd relikvia vásárlás különösen vicces. 
Elég sok ponton hasonlít a Cubára, ami kicsit furcsa.
Egyetlen hibája, hogy több ponton is erőltetett és nagyon erős szerencse szerep van. Amivel nem is lenne akkora baj, de egy 2-2.5 órás játéknál ez szerintem irreálisan sok. Ráadásul egyik sem az alapmechanikából fakad, emiatt érthetetlen, hogy miért kellett direkt beletenni egy kiszámíthatatlanságot egy olyan játékba, amibe érezhetően nem való.

RATING: 4
Colonia is a resource conversion game. Players collect resources, turn them into merchandise which they then sell to traders in the harbour, and use the money to buy relics that increase their prestige which is equivalent to victory points.

Like with most other games of that type there is quite a bit of planning involved in order to optimise your production chain and produce the required goods at the right time. Unlike many other implementations, however, Colonia includes a number of features at all steps in the process that obsolete many of the carefully constructed plans and hand the supply chain management over to plain luck instead. It doesn't help that it is overly procedural in execution. A round takes quite some time even though there are very few interesting decisions to make during that time, and even those few are largely overwhelmed by lucky draws and the vagaries of turn order.

Colonia is a competently crafted "typical Euro" sort of game in the now slightly old-fashioned sense.  I enjoyed my first game, but ultimately I don't think there's enough payoff for all the placing worker cubes and reclaiming worker cubes and taking resources and paying resources and taking crafted goods and shipping crafted goods and taking money (in four currencies!) and spending money and gaining victory point cards.  All of that happens every round, and not just a little bit of it.  A lot of it.  And there are six rounds.  I just don't think all the shuffling bits around the absurdly oversized board is worth it for this lather, rinse, repeat game with no story arc.

Colonia is beautiful!! 

The game idea is great, during the length of the week send out your people to town, go to the market, get resources, turn them into products, load those onto ships, get money for them and for cash get relics. Sounds interesting and fun. One caveat... you don't always get what you want, which makes it harder to get money to do ANYTHING with them. Most of the time the cash you have, can't buy you things that are available right now. Plus the boats are so finicky that sometimes you get lots of cash, sometimes not. And the cash you might be getting is not of the currency that you wish you'd get since the relics are in different one. The 4 different currencies really throw a "curve ball" into the whole game. If it was just one currency, it would be much easier to get more relics. Otherwise your points at the end of the game are ranging from 3 to 6 or 8. If you get more, you're just lucky.

Those 2 things, the boats and 4 currencies throw the game off a bit. But you can still plan ahead and get the right products onto right boats, only you have to be very vigilant about it.

Despite that, the game is very enjoyable, but it might take a loooong time to acquire anything worth getting, products, money, or relics. Sometimes you need 2 rounds to get something good, and the game only lasts 6 rounds.

Overall an enjoyable game. Tight with resources and getting money. And the relic cards just throw a monkey wrench in your plan every round.

In this game you need to heavily "think backwards":

To get victory points you need money.  To get money you need to ship goods.  To ship goods you need to get put them on the right ships.  To get goods you need to get the correct resources to manufacture them.  And to get resources you need to claim them from the board.  All this is done in a turn order which is determined at the start of the round.  So you need to carefully plan your actions "backwards" starting from the desired result.  This is nothing unusual but unfortunately, the planning is rather fiddly and the actions of the other players heavily interfere with your action.  So during one turn, each player has to re-iterate his actions again and again and again.  And unfortunately, this does not change for the entire game of ~2 hours.

I love complex games and I have no problem with planning my strategy in advance, but this game is simply no fun at all.  It's boring & repetetive work.  Our group was exhausted after the game and will most likely never play it again.

This game is purely tactical, and there is way too little you can do to mitigate bad luck. Played a six player game, and the game would possibly be better with only four player, as you have more workers in circulation. 

But still... there is so many step to produce a Victory Point, that just one step not clicking for you, be it wrong mix of resources, production-dice not going your way, ships doesn't want the mix of products you have or the money you have doesn't fit (four diffrent currencies) with what cards are availible, then you are HOSED by the game!

This one is just way to random, and that is coming from someone who think that there has to be some form of randomness in a game after setup...

Good looking, and clear and functional board, with good iconograpy, but gameplay is lacking, and it is too long for what it is...

It's the good kind of beefy euro we haven't seen in a while: A little complicated but well streamlined. It is easy to see how every step affects the next step down the line, but not so easy to plan several steps ahead. The voting mechanism is very interesting. Great looking board and production. On the downside, it's a bit on the long side and does require a lot of fiddly housekeeping. Still, I'd like to see it hit the table more often.

Adquirí este juego en primera medida por lo vistoso de sus componentes. En el juego eres una familia que planifica sus acciones para toda la semana, principalmente intentas adquirir materias primas para transformarlas en productos, posteriormente los vendes y adquieres el dinero en 4 diferentes tipos de moneda, lo que permitirá comprar diferentes tipos de reliquias, las cuales representan los puntos de victoria en el juego.

Al jugarlo no fue uno de esos juegos que le dejan a uno la sensación de querer repetir una partida, pienso que su mecánica euro se queda solamente en intercambiar cubos de un lugar a otro. Me gustó el hecho que halla diferentes tipos de monedas y la planificación de la familia a través de la semana, sin tener la posibilidad de recuperarlos hasta la semana siguiente, al igual los decretos y su votación de acuerdo a la influencia. Pienso que sería un juego mejor si no fuera tan fácil adquirir las materias primas y se tuviera menos cantidad de miembros en las familias. Igualmente se me hizo bastante extenso para hacer  exactamente lo mismo cada ronda.  En últimas un juego euro familiar que tendré guardado por bastante tiempo antes de que vuelva a salir a mesa.

Lots of bits do not necessarily mean a complex game, but in the case of Colonia, they do.  Every game piece serves a purpose and everything from the cards, resources and map are all functional and (more or less) required.

At its core Colonia is a worker placement game.  Your meeples are used to influence votes, hire craftsmen, and load ships.  The ones you use this round are not available again until after the next, so there is a great balance to the game.  And considering that there are only 6 rounds... every decision counts.

My problem with the game is its randomness.  Way too much.  In a 6-player game you only get 21 meeples and, that is NOT nearly enough, especially if you want to vote, buy, produce, ship, and gain relics in one round (and save enough to vote in the next).  When the minimum shipment is worth 2 and the minimum cost for a relic is 5, it will take three rounds to buy something... and that is assuming you get the right currency (out of four).

The game also plays a little long for my tastes and the decisions to be made each turn don't make up for that.  I initially gave this game a 7, but after a few solo plays, I dropped it to a 5.  

A few house rules might make this better... the first thing I'd do is add at least 2-3 workers per player each round, then drop the four different currencies down to 1 or 2.  This would make the game much more competative.

The worker management was innovative and interesting.  The board was very cool, kind of a mini-game in and of itself.  The rest of it felt fiddly to me, and a little stale; get resources of type A to turn in for resources of type B to buy resources of type C felt frustrating (probably because 4 of the 5 players kept mixing up the colors of barrels needed for resources) and unnecessarily complex, the whole multiple currencies thing is old and annoying (again, the colors were terribly chosen), even the setup each week was annoying -- do the market stalls really need a different number of goods each week?

Now this was the game I really wanted in the maths trade where I got Caylus. I happened to mention to the guy who had put it up in the maths trade that I had wanted it. He said I have two copies, I'll sell you one, he did at a very very good price.

It has not been very well received, people seem to think it's too complicated to be a gateway game and too easy to be a gamers game. Which must mean my taste is somewhere in between as I really like it. 

Each player controls a medieval family in the town of Colonia. You buy resources, manufacture goods, sell them abroad and with the money you make buy religious relics. Family with the best relics wins the game.

Cuba scratches the same itch in less time and less mess.  I do like the voting and market and production and shipping.  The conversion to VPs is lame lame lame.  Colonia also makes a lot of use of overlaid 'efficiency' - e.g. a 1VP relic costs 5, a 2VP relic costs 9, a 3VP relic costs 12, a 4VP relic costs 14 and a 5VP relic costs 15.  I really dislike that kind of thing - its artificial and clearly designed to generate 'agonising decisions' *yawn*.  Really elegant game designs don't need this kind of thing.

Henn's take on worker placement à la Pillars of the Earth. I wonder if Cologne ever shipped merchandise to Novgorod or London or if it just was taken as a reference to increase sales. A Hansa theme would have been more appropriate. Bremen is not taken yet as a game name. It can feel a bit procedural with 6 similar rounds being played. For my taste, the graphical design is overwrought.
Notwithstanding these niggles Colonia is a fine game where your decisions matter and which might rise to a better rating with more plays.

I think this game is underrated. The components and board are beautiful, the rules are clear (even in translation), and the design has twists enough to keep it compelling. The competition for the various things you need is tight but it never seems hopeless; voting on edicts can sometimes help you or make it harder for other players; and it seems that never enough ships sail! The theme is nicely integrated and I would consider this a potential gateway game too, if a bit on the heavy end of that spectrum.

During rules explanation I thought Colonia is a parody of modern eurogames: no drama or real player interaction apart from "I took something you might have wanted" and core mechanism is placing cubes to get stuff, which is converted to different kind of stuff, which is converted to different kind of stuff, which is converted to victory points.

Turns out the game isn't actually that bad. Its just very, very, very bland and forgettable.

Played once, 5 players.  Pretty good, but pretty long.  This is really just a currency exchange game, though, for all its prettiness.  You have one resource, which you trade for another resource, which you trade for another resource,  which you trade for another resource, which you ultimately trade for victory points.  There's a hint of push your luck in there too.  Worth playing more, but not too often.  This was too long with 5, and I imagine it will be unbearable with 6.

This is another game I really wanted to love but learned to almost dislike in my first game.  Not sure if I even want to give it another go.  There are so many chaotic elements to this game despite the illusion of control that appears to be present.  I was able to usually gather as many resources as I wanted, but the market was usually very frustrating as you couldn't trade those resources into the needed commodities to ship in the next day for one of four specific different types of currency which then are used to purchase like colored artifacts.  The last round can be particularly vicious as you cannot really plan much for it and if you aren't first in turn order, you stand a great likelihood of being screwed over.  Nope, not a game for me after my first play.

This game needs to be SHORTER. 

There are 4 sections: The Market , The Craftsmen, The Ships, and The Relics 

All 4 are random and all 4 need to align somehow to allow you to make points. That's not saying you can't save resources, goods, or money for the "right time", but then making money with your goods is difficult as how many ships will sail is also random, and if like in our game an average of 1 ship sails, there aren't many opportunities to make money.

Random, random, random, and if you get lucky you make points.....and I came in second.

Sorry, this one is a PASS. It only gets a 6 for the core mechanisms.

Game in a Nutshell: Use worker resources to exchange for good, which gets traded in for other goods, then sold for money used to buy relics worth victory points.

Played as: 3 player

Pros: Beautiful board that's also well laid out to follow the logical progression of each round. The game is fairly intuitive to understand and flows as nicely as any game I can think of. It's an interesting exercise in looking ahead and puzzle-piecing the steps to what you want while taking into account how others are going to screw with you along the way. Being able to vote on the random rule breaks is a nice added level of control and adds a bit of variety. Probably a good next step game for people want to try something a little heavier then the ordinary gateway games.

Cons: I thought something could have been stripped out of the game: one of the trading steps, the final buys stage, a couple rounds... something. As is, there's a lot of same-same. Trading one thing for another (which is virtually all this game does) isn't a bad step if it's small in terms of a bigger picture, but in this game where it's 5 out of 6 active steps each round, it reminds me of that snake eating its own tail hardly any sense of purpose.

Other: I think the game lacked tightness with three people. My hope would be that it is far more competitive with more when the jockeying for position at various market stalls could possibly over-shadow the constant trading of one thing for another.

Best Use: Could be a tight tactical mid-weight game of resource management for 4 or more players. More likely a stepping stone to something with a little more bite.

A game where you are constantly changing your goods and tokens from one phase to the next where finally, after 5 conversions, you can do things that score you points.

The production value of this game is really gorgeous, and it had me enraptured for a large chunk of the game.  Mid-way through the game however, the production values do not hold up the game-play of constantly changing your goods from one thing to the next over and over.  It becomes repetitive and tedious.

There's no story arc whatsoever, it's just six rounds of exactly the same. Very tedious. The mechanism for the worker supply is ingenious, though.

Has the suckiest paper money I've ever seen. Also, the colors of the currencies are extremely hard to tell apart from each other. The meeples in the collector's edition are a lot less usable than cubes. The Wallenstein-sized box isn't too user-friendly either.

Alhambra on steroids, here featuring a classic waterfall conversion structure. Play 6 rounds. Each round you get resources, turn the resources into goods, place the goods into cargo holds which match to 4 different currencies, then buy victory point cards using the specific currencies acquired. Turn order is crucial as there's luck everywhere, and the way things pan out (with everyone playing 1-use turn-order cards from identical decks) everyone will have their fair share at going first, but will all the stuff you want come out when you're ready to go first or not. Turn order is crucial as you maintain first spot (say) through the whole round - first pick of resources, first pick at picking goods, first pick at loading cargo holds, first pick at picking up victory point cards. On any other turn, you're going to be hosed by those going ahead of you. Meaning that's a lot of turns where you don't have a lot of control. At 2 hours there was way too much repetition and work involved, with analysis paralysis strike-able as you're trying to work out who's going to go for what cargo holds / currencies, then work backwards to work out what goods you might be able to get, and then work backwards from there to work out what resources to take. Too much guesswork required, so just take a bit of everything, get what you can for cheap, and hope the victory point cards with the matching currencies you want to collect don't appear at the docks until you have a shot at going first. After 1 game I've felt I've explored it and I don't need to play again.

What it is, though, is convoluted: you have to do this to do that, you have to do that to do this, etc.  And it does take a while to play, and AP can really drag the game to a halt.  So, while I really don't mind the convolution, I didn't really find that there was any one part of the game that was hugely compelling.  It was still enjoyable, though.

A smooth flowing game about planning a few turns ahead. If you're not paying attention, you can find yourself caught off guard at the worst possible moment. That being said, it doesn't take much effort to get what you want in this game. Most of the time the only real threat comes from the players ahead of you in turn order. Some scoring methods are clearly better than others.

Overall, a pretty basic game. Deluxe edition is very nice to look at. Love the puzzle connection board. Gameplay could grow stale in time.

This game is a heavier Euro type game.  Feels like a mash up of Alhambra and Fresco with a little Pillars of the Earth.  You try to outguess your opponents with the start player order (Fresco) then go around the board and try to convert resources to good (pillars/ fresco) and then trade them in for multiple currency types (as in Alhambra) to buy relic which is really the main way to get points.  The market portion s of the board remind me of pillars because your trying to choose locations that to get resources but also trying to block opponents from getting there's especially when they are low on workers.  Anyway, just a great mash up of a game with multiple layers of tactics and strategy.

Beautiful game. You think you got a large family so you can do a lot. Well, that turns out very different. And we played it with 3, so with all the 38 members. You can emagine how tough it is to even get e relic when you play with 6.

This is quite an interesting game - after playing for the first (and so far only) time in the summer of 2014, I was very surprised to find it rated so low here on BGG. While the basic flow of the game is a pretty generic conversion sequence - get resources, use them to produce goods, load goods onto ships to get money, then spend money (which comes in 4 different currencies) to get victory points - this game has several fairly unique features that liven it up immensely. The first is that you need to allocate meeples for each action, and have only a finite number in total - and each allocation keeps them there until the same point in the next turn, so you are constantly having to decide what the priorities are for placement of your meeples. Especially as you often want to keep a fair few back for the start of the next round in order to claim a better turn position - being late in turn order can kill you in this game, as you'll have last choice of everything. The second unique feature is that there are 3 possible additional rules each turn, which are applied or not based on a vote of all players. Placing more meeples in the "council chamber" not only puts you further ahead in turn order, it also gives your votes on these greater weight. (And makes this quite different from the voting in Lancaster, the only other game I have played with a similar voting mechanic.)

This is not a game I'd want to play every week, by any means - but it is certainly interesting and unique. And full of interesting and meaningful decisions - which is what you want of any game.

nice mechs BUT WAY TOO RANDOM.
final scores were 13,13,12,12,12,8 but cld all have changed in last phase of last round depending what cards/ships were drawn that round.
kinda game i dont mind playing but would be happy never to play again
will point out that this is NOT my kinda game - it requires u to not only plan your entire round at the start of the round but also plan most of the next one as well - same kinda thought processes as age of steam and it seems i suck at this :(

RATING: 6.5
Fairly chaotic for a game of this (considerable) length.  Actualy, it was less that there was TOO much chaos and more that the consequences of getting a LITTLE unlucky were pretty harsh.  Failing to get an order filled at a craftsman ties up cubes, but also means you didn't get to fill that order at the harbor, and since the ship sails away, you don't get a second chance.  So a little unforgiving.  Still, elegant and fun.

Yet another Euro in which you get resources to exchange them for other kind of resources until finally you're able to buy victory points.  Of course, some mechanics and luck are thrown in to let the resource exchange be a little bit different from other similar games out there, but at the end they all feel the same.  Perhaps too long for a game of this weight.

RATING: 6.5
I like some of the ideas here: resource conversion, voting, placing a limited number of workers for turn order.  However, I think that if the money were simply generic and there was not a phase to get resources (you simply placed workers to create goods), it would be a much faster and enjoyable game, while still having most of the great flavor of the current game.  Essentially, it is long for what it is and too cumbersome.  However, my rating is buoyed a bit by my friend's enthusiasm for the game, although my initial impression was tainted, so maybe this rating is just right.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The only thing I wish was different in Colonia is the lack of rules to scale available meeple and number of rounds to the number of players.  The recently posted house rules to allow players to trade with each other may have spiced things up, but I'm not convinced that wouldn't undermine the importance of everything else.  Maybe allowing for bribes to counter some of the randomness that puts many people off?

For myself, I think it is refreshing to have a euro game that is not centered around engine building, but rather simpler-than-it-sounds resource to money to VP conversion, wherein the board itself is the engine and the players are "operating" it to attain maximum efficiency.  The other interesting thing here is that  obstacles come both from the board itself AND the other players, as well as from your own mismanagement of resources (meeples), which complicates the process.  I think the game at it's core revovles around the importance of how the players manage their meeple, which is to say optimal allocation will trump the randomness overall.

I do think it is possible that Queen wanted Dirk Henn to "dumb down" the game with luck, but we won't likely know as the man doesn't appear to be very vocal about his work.  I actually think there are variant rules he probably wrote that we will likely never see.

Gorgeous production, as expected of Queen (and that in the standard edition!). At its best it's a dry cube-pusher, to which I certainly do not object, and the mechanisms for managing turn order and worker commitment are clever -- the timing of recovering commited cubes has a lot of potential. Even the capricious production is quite enjoyable, with a fun push-your-luck aspect. It's not a bad family game.

But as a gamer's game it fails on almost every level. The scoring system is tedious and artificial. The many, many random elements (goods, production, shipping opportunities, purchase opportunities) make long-term planning laughable. And it runs far, far too long for a game with this little to offer.

Played a 6 player and felt that there was always someone else who was just about to do what I wanted to do but they would be going before me. Even when I became mayor on the last turn, an edict came up that was voted on which sent the ship I had been planning to put goods on, off before I could do it. It was a very frustrating experience and resulted in my final score being 6 points. It is a game of almost total open information and if you've got a amazing memory or take notes, I'm sure you could reduce the problems I had by avoiding doing what other players were doing. I would give it another go and see if it was just me being very unlucky.

RATING: 5
Single 4-player game. Very processional & repetitious worker placement game. The biggest problem seemed lack of opportunity. You can only grab what's available and there's (almost) no way to get anything by an alternate route. If market stalls have no white resources, you can't get white resources so you can't make shirt or shoe goods. Without shirt or shoe goods you might not be able to load into today's ships, without loading into a ship you can’t get cash to buy VP. In our game, one player ended with lots of a currency who's VP cards didn't appear in the final round, [-]and most of the final round was skipped because only one ship would be sailing and it was already fully loaded from the previous round.[/-] The 'worker return' mechanism is interesting, but not interesting enough to make you forget everything else.

[i]Update:[/i] we missed that [i]all[/i] ships sail in the last round, so maybe there's hope for an improved rating.

I like most of the game except the shipment stage. There's a "buying in bulk" aspect to that stage followed by a "buying in bulk" aspect in the relic stage that it feeds in to. That multiplies the benefit to a point where the players are pretty much sitting on goods to jump on $15 shipments and then buy 5vp relics. All the lowest shipments and relics were left by the players. So most of those relic cards and small shipments only have the effect of being duds when they're flipped up for that week. So on average there only ends up being 3 shipment done in a week and then 1 or 2 relics bought. It seems like a lot of activity for the previous part of the turn just to have everyone pounce on just a few opportunities at the end of the turn. So each player has a turn where they might pick up 10 raw materials and then turn that in to 5 goods but then maybe 1 shipment and then MAYBE 1 relic.

I enjoyed my first play of Colonia and my rating may improve with subsequent plays. I like that the game is so transparent about turning one type of thing into another and then into another (a chain of five consecutive stations in Colonia) while still holding up fairly well in the theme department. Having the five areas laid out in order on the large game board allows players to at least try to plan several moves, and sometimes even several turns, ahead. I have the "collector's edition," and having the little mini-meeples is somehow more satisfying than placing generic cubes :)

Like a Hollywood blockbuster, Colonia represents the pinnacle of two hot trends while not being a great work of art.  The trends are worker placement (228 count'em wooden workers) and resource conversion (workers-materials-goods-money-relics).  How far can we go with this?  There are too many unpredictable events in the lengthy game.

Colonia was hilariously miserable. Somehow a great designer and a great publisher teamed up to create a game that is so dry and procedural as to be drier than the ten driest Knizia games rolled into one. I was begging the other players to abort the game prematurely, but there was one stubborn holdout who steadfastly refused. The conversion of tan resource barrels into gray resource chits into purple resource slips of paper into purple resource cards just makes me sad. The game consists of 6 disconnected rounds to artificially add length and substance to this procedural exercise. Over and over the players walk through the conversion of resource barrels into resource chits into resource slips of paper into resource cards. The players feel no connection whatsoever to the game and no real involvement in the endlessly churning gears of the mechanics. I can't possibly care about the conveyor belt of resource conversion, and not caring making for a very boring experience. This is a game that could have worked just as well with 3 or 4 rounds instead of 6, and just as well with 2 or 3 conversion steps, but instead the game piles in as much as possible, overloading the game well beyond anything that the framework can bear. There is more information overload in this game than I could have thought possible, but just enough randomness in terms of what resources are actually available along the conveyor belt and what victory points are waiting for you once you reach the end of the chain that planning is a lost cause. You're just a hapless cog in the game's machine. I feel as if I just have to say here that I love Dirk Henn's Wallenstein and really enjoy his Atlantic Star, and I'm a big fan of many Queen games, such as Aton, Chicago Express, and Roma. But that just makes it harder for me to fathom how a game like Colonia came to be.

Beautiful game. Get the collector's edition! it is a great game. The rules are simple but there can be a lot of analysis/paralysis until you can figure out how the ships connect to the goods and how the goods to the resources. It is just too much to easily keep track all the info, plus how to hinder other players. There are a lot of choices to be made in this game, and it may seem in the first play that it does not matter how many meeples you send to each place, but you will discover soon that it makes a big difference.

Colonia is a worker placement game that is economy driven, with an ultimate objective of collecting rare artifacts/relics that are worth victory points at the end of the game.

The game seems well made, but there are a few elements that our group didn't seem to care for.

From a components standpoint, it is VERY tough to tell the resources and money apart from each other.  Both use a bland color palette that is tricky.  Some were ok with it, but others were regularly leaning into their stockpile and the table to see what the heck was going on.

Gameplay wise, it is really dry.  Like, Sahara dry.  You're ultimately all competing for the same resources for different reasons. 

The "Artifact Bucks" are a good idea, but the way Victory Points are calculated seems like a bust.  There is no reason at all to diversify between artifacts, as Victory Points are based on raw score.  The multiplyer cards are a good idea, but aside from that, there is no reason to get one type vs another.  (contrast this to a game like Tigris and Euphrates that forces you to diversify, or Seven Wonders where you can get multiplyers for sets, etc)

I basically felt hamstrung for 2 hours, which isn't a great feeling, lol.  I like games with tough choices, but this felt either too tough, or not enough choice, or both.

Colonia in the Middle Ages. The largest city of the Holy Roman Empire is renowned for its famous cathedrals and versatile trade. Reputable patrician families hold influential positions in the City Council and are in control of the city’s fortune. They are always striving to increase their riches and to consolidate their power. Each family wants to be the most influential - but only one may achieve this goal!
The players take on the role of influential patrician families in Medieval Colonia. They strive to lead their family to the most powerful position by acquiring precious relics. In order to achieve this, players must buy commodities and produce and sell goods. Only families selling their goods for a high price can afford expensive relics. The player owning the most valuable collection of relics at the end of the game will be the winner.

On par with the meatier games released in the Essen 09 crop.  I like the prodution conversion element and don't have a problem with it being a longer game though maybe the number of turns could have been scaled to the number of players.  There's a lot going on which may push things out of the family game realm and for me puts it closer to a gamer's game.  Need to play more to see if it's getting an unfair rap from the predominantly Euro crowd playing this game.  Also, I got the "collector's edition (#806) and from what I can see, the only difference is that this comes with small meeples figures instead of just cubes.  The meeples are also smaller than your standard ones so I'm not seeing a great need for anyone to spend the extra bucks on that version unless you can get it for a good price.  The box art is a bit fancier and there are dividers in the box but I don't know if the basic version comes with these or not.  Still, for a deluxe edition I would have expected more.  Played with the full complement of six players and had a good time.  It went about 3 hours with rules explaining which is about right for six.  I didn't think it outlasted its welcome and will play this again.

Busy, busy, busy!

Not only the board itself but I felt like I was constantly pushing cubes around for the entire game.  The worker allotment mechanic was pretty much the only highlight in Colonia, with everything else having a been there done that tiredness to them: blind bidding for turn order; collecting resources to turn them into contracts which will then fill specific boats for currency of a given color (Alhambra-style); use money to buy victory points; there was even voting, three times each round no less.

If you like frantic pacing to your games, then you might be interested in Colonia.  I, on the other hand, felt like I did a lot of busy work for very little substance in return.  Decent, but I've played better stuff than this.

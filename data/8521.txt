This is THE game to play for WW2 aircombat. Anything you can do i an aircraft, you can do in this game. Excellent damage system too : you can kill the enemy early if you punch a hole in the pilot or cause a fuel leak and engine fire.

This is the game I have played most over the last 2 years. The basics are very digestable, but the depth of play and advanced flight rules available truly make for a game which will keep you grasping for its mastery.

This is NOT a simple game - some call it the 'ASL' (Advanced Squad Leader) of air gaming. I personally do not think it is nearly as difficult as ASL is, but it is certainly not Down In Flames, either.

Excellent game, but requires commitment to learn. The quick start rules are the place to begin. Also helpfull for me was the game example at www.users.bigpond.net.au/mantis/FW/FW.htm under quick start pack. It brought the game to life for me.
this is esentially a flight simulator on paper.

RATING: 10
THE game for playing plane v plane combat in WW II.  I have played many of air combat games and this one is the only one that keeps me coming back for more.  I liken it to a constantly changing puzzle as you strive to get into firing position.  Always enjoyable--even when shot down!!

Part of the challenge is learning to fly in the vertical AND the horizontal.  But that is the essence of fighter combat.

Start with the Quick start rules.  After you learn how to fly move on to the full rules.  You'll be glad you did.

ENJOY!

Huge step up in complexity from Buffalo Wings, and I've only begun to scratch the surface. Still working on the mechanics of movement in my first full game, and can't even imagine how it'd be if I didn't already feel comfortable with air combat maneuvering. While the system works and has plenty of detail, the fact remains that its step wise spreadsheet management nature makes it a very different thing than a real time flight simulator. Not necessarily bad, but no where near as visceral and exciting.....Addendum 7/2015. It's like a football game that makes you calculate the angle and vector of force for your pass, while doing the same for your receiver. Once you're in the ballpark, roll the dice to see if he misses it. It's a simulation for physicists who wish they were pilots.

RATING: 2
This is an absolutely fascinating table top flight simulator.  In my solo flights I've learned a ton about flying, and I love learning about all the planes and actions of the era.  But, this is really just not a dogfighting game.  It's a flight simulator.  There is no excitment or reaction or uncertainty because of the horrible initiative system.  If you win initiative, the other plane moves first, and you have all day (playing PBEM) to do the math to figure out how to best approach him.  That initiative system is just horribly unfun.  How about simultaneous resolution like Wooden Ships & Iron Men, but winning the initiative makes the other plane tell you just his bank direction for the turn and his transition direction.  Then once you got good at the game you could speed the turns up enough to really feel like dogfighting instead of flying for Delta.

This isn't a 2 because I still read the manual and daydream about bouncing fools from out of the sun.  (Back to a 2 hoping I don't get yelled at by the designer again.  Updating my ratings.)

RATING: 10
The best WWII air combat game bar none.  The flight mechanics are easy to learn, the results are reasonably accurate to scale (so you can play "what ifs" to your heart's content), and it includes air-ground and air-ship combat to boot!  What's even better is the community that the game's designer, JD Webster, has built on line; they're a bunch of great guys who are continuously playing games by e-mail, using excellent VASSAL and Cyberboard modules, and training newbies.  If you have any interest in this period of aviation history, you'll enjoy this game.

The apogee of the FIGHTING WINGS system series and its highest/most complex expression.  Not for the faint of heart, especially when air-to-surface attacks against ships are played!  Learning curve is not steep; be prepared to spend a good bit of time with the system before you become comfortable with it.  The detail and nuance can be overwhelming at times, but once absorbed it's well worth it for the narrative it produces.  This is the ASL of air games!

RATING: 6
rating based on the 'richness' of the rulebook; difficult to find opponents willing to put in the time to learn the game.  Very nice to play, but having an expert on hand is fairly important (and I'm not an expert).

The difficulty scale of this game has made it impossible to find players.

Includes Achtung, Spitfire!, Over the Reich, Buffalo Wings, Top Cover, and Check Your 6!

Miniatures 9mm (1/200):
(6) Polikarpov I-16 18/24
(2) Petlyakov Pe-2
(4) Brewster M-339 Buffalo
(2) Curtiss H-75A
(2) Morane-Saulnier Ms.406
(2) Fiat G.50 bis

rating is a recent downgrade of all complicated air combat games.  I have had an epiphany that for all the mental overhead, they just aren't that fun to play and it is too difficult to find opponents.  Many of the games just end up being indecisive turn-fests, or won by a lucky shot/initiative die-roll.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
You can see this game as follow:

Rules: very complex, but realist. Fortunately, there is "quick start" rules aivable!

Historicity: great, it seems to be a priority of this game, and aircrafts are different each others, so you can't pilot a P40 as you pilot a A6M2...

Playability: the great threat is the "rule gap", first you had to be familiar with them, then you can explore the rest of the game, but simply reading the rulebook I can say that WD is a complete game. You can play air-to-air, air-to-ground and air-to-naval combat, (but not ship-to-ship battle ;-)). You can also play entire missions (from take-off to landing) and even campaign. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Good air game that has TOO MUCH detail, so the ammount of work to have the planes going around is high. The flight model is very good, the playability is also good, but a lot of work even with the QS-Rules.

Pros: very detailed; a lot of planes; programmed instructions; very well supported by author; a very active player community.

Cons: very detailed; too much work for 4 seconds of real time turns.

The finest game available on dogfighting aircraft in World War II. It is the most recent in the Fighting Wings series of games, following Over the Reich and Achtung Spitfire!

In addition to dogfighting, Whistling Death covers air-to-surface combat against naval and ground targets. There are a great number of aircraft and ships covered in this wonderfully produced game.

A wonderful tactical simulation of flight. It uses clever abstraction to model realistic physics. Games such as this are engaging and a bottomless pit of depth. Even learning to master a single plane could take a life time, let alone understanding multiple aircraft all in the air at once, the mind boggles.

RATING: 8.75
I'm the designer and I was asked to rate my own game.  Okay, then, I would say this is my best effort to date on the topic of WW2 air combat.  Give myself a 10 for research.  Especially since it has a wealth of detail in the air-to-ground and air-to-ship scenarios and also introduces night-fighting rules.  As far as board games go, effort has been made to make the game system more accessible by including a quick-start section of rules that has you flying and fighting after reading only 4 pages compared to the 80 pages of full rules (flying is just 15 pages).  Is it the best GAME in the genre out there? I'd say yes for the moment on the topic.  Of course I don't give myself a 9 or 10 rating since, all though this is about all I play these days, I still see areas for rules improvement and development - and the style of game (hexgrid, logsheets, detailed movement system) doesn't have a wide appeal in the general game market (6-7 for appeal / playability).  It is definitely a game for the person who has a high interest in WW2 air combat, and who wants to understand how and why certain tactics were developed in that war for the different planes involved.

Ooh, and don't worry about being accused of "shilling" by the older geeks here. In time, air gamers will prove their point with a valid say on the Genre.

Excellant simulation of WW II aircombat manuevering. I get a sense of why some planes excelled at dogfitting and others at Boom and Zoom. It's major flaw is the (necessary) complexity (but the enclosed set of quick start rules help) Expandable to all theaters and similar eras (plenty of data charts availible from the FW series)PS. Just finished a PBEM game, Yaks and Me 109's using the Quick Start rules from this edition, had a blast...I died in a head on collison with my enemy, Long live the Rodina!

While I'm still partial to the European Theater of Operations, I will still recommend this game to the Fighting Wings fans out there.  The Whistling Death rules set can be applied to your Over The Reich and Achtung Spitfire games.  Don't let the "Advanced Squad Leader of air combat games" descriptions scare you.  I own/play those games, so I can tell you that Whistling Death is somewhere between Squad Leader and Advanced Squad Leader in complexity.  Like SL/ASL, you learn by playing the game.  Some of the more intricate descriptions in the rulebook will make sense after you see it played out on the map.  Quick start rules are available (and recommended) for the players that are unfamiliar with the Fighting Wings system.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've never found the Fighting Wings series as natural to play as the Air Superiority series was, and its flight mechanics have grown a bit fiddlier in recent years, but it's far and away the best WW2 air combat game system around (and the operational system is a delight).  WD is worth buying for the massive scenario book and aircraft data cards alone.  Only real low point: the stunningly low-quality 3-hex ship counters fobbed off on buyers by Clash of Arms as a cost-cutting measure in an otherwise nice set of  components.

RATING: 5
Very complex game, latest version of the Fighting Wings series rules.  Designer provides excellent support here and through the Yahoo groups.

A quickstart set of rules is provided to ease you into the game, but a lot of time will be needed to learn this game. 

The Fighting Wings games are very detailed, and thus, very complex simulations of aerial combat in WWII.  It takes a lot of time to manevuer aircraft into position to attack, and that doesn't happen very often.  It takes hours to simulate a few seconds of real time.

RATING: 8
Lastest game in the Fighting Wings series (Achtung Spitfire & Over the reich, and their more distant cousins in the Airpower series: Air Superiority and Air Strike, and Speed of Heat) covering the pacific war with air to air and anti-shipping scenarios. 

All I find lacking are some good air-to-ground missions on land and a corresponding map (there should be enough to choose from, from the island hopping campaigns)

WD sports the latest version of the Fighting Wings rules (2.0), which brings some additions that greatly improves vertical maneuvering and 3D-geometry. Quite a hefty read, but a retrofit of WD's rules to the earlier games is a must!

The counters are gorgeous, the map a bit less so and the amount of tables and player aids is also somewhat large, neccesitating a fair bit of flipping.

Haven't played it F2F yet, as opponents are a bit hard to find, but analysing the training scenarios has been good fun, so I might do some solo play

WW2 Air Combat - "Fighting Wings" pacific air combat.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
What's to love?

It's the biggest and most comprehensive WWII air simulation ever - by far the best set of rules of any game. 
Unbelievably well researched - like all of JD's games.  
The airplane and small ship counters are first rate. Over 100 scenarios - many solitaire frendly.  
The quickstart rules are only 4 pages long but they could have been presented better.
Incredible customer service from JD and others.

What's not to love?

Only one map and it's blue and featureless.   
The capital ship counters are thin cardstock and badly printed.    
Game is very tedious - not as bad as preplotted games but still quite a bit of recordkeeping per plane (or ship).  
Flying more than a couple of airplanes per player is hard to manage.Hard to find opponents.  
Planeloads of errata.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I've played this game system (Fighting Wings) more over its lifetime than anything else.  I love the granularity in distinguishing aircraft and that the game does a good job of giving a feel for the tactics and flying within the confines of a fun game.

There are a ton of aircraft data cards and scenarios.  A huge amount of play value.

Because they're all the same system (though the base system has been refined over the years, I play all of them with the latest rules and there is full backward compatibility in the games), I have the same comments for Over the Reich, Achtung Spitfire! and Whistling Death.

The ultimate edition of the Fighting Wings system, introducing naval units and the Japanese to the game. Years of refinement have added greater resolution to the game, particularly in its handling of movement in 3D.

The research behind the data cards is outstanding and should satisfy the die hard air warfare fan.

RATING: 8
The additional complexity (especially in the vertical dimension) introduced in these rules compared to Over the Reich and Achtung Spitfire! is just too much of a good thing and results in rules that are overall much more fiddly and opaque. WD 2.0 is to the 1.0 rules as ASL is to SL. So, the fraternity of elite FW pilots will have to carry on without this 'nugget' as I trudge along trying to digest the 1.0 rules.

The 8 rating is for the wonderful counters and scenarios. The 2.0 complexity would drastically slow FTF play and would best be applied to PBEM.

(OK, I'm going to give these rules another try.)
(Even training Scenario 2 has my head spinning, there are just too many special cases.....)

J.D. Webster's Fighting Wings series of games are the best World War II air combat games ever. The learning curve is steep, but it is worth it.

RATING: 10
I would rate this game as a definite 10--perhaps the most intense game I've ever played.  But only via email...which is funny I suppose...but the problem is it's just a little too complex to be fun for me in a face-to-face setting.

That reads kind of odd, but for me the fact that the 30 second dog-fight is such a slow, procedural and conceptual effort, it plays better over a period of days/weeks, as oppposed to a few hours of F2F time.

To play it face to face I have to REALLY be in the mood for it.

Complicated but extremely accurate and complete.  It is by far, the most accurate translation of flight to game that I have come across.  This system is fantastic!

Been playing this one for years now, and if I could give an 11, I would.  There simply does not exist a more tense, more brain-intensive, more thought provoking game.  The pbem tournaments JD organizes are simply fantastic--new planes, new VCs, new players (okay not a lot of *new* players, but a lot of players).  This game just gets better and better!

Played a Achtung! Spitfire and Over the Reich a lot in the past. This is really good extension to those. Just right amount of chrome without sacrificing flow of the game. Realistic flight engine. However, word of warning, it takes few sorties to get basics running but since that it works like a dream. :)
Additional value for the game comes from very well designed tactical and operational scale play and massive amount of scearios that is provided.

Simplified flight engine available on Buffalo Wings.

Very complicated, but once you get use to it, you realize that it it is never unnecessarily complicated and that you would lose something important by cutting more rules.

Was fortunate to play with 1/72 airplane models mounted on antennas allowing us to change altitude, climb, and roll on the models which made the game a lot more intuitive and fun.

Great fun if you can find someone else dedicated enough to WWII flight to learn and play it.

The updated mechanics (over OTR and Achtuyng Spitfire) are a noteworthy improvement.  The whole system (and its other support) can now simlulate damn near any WW2 period tactical aerial scenario (1936-1952 )

My favourite tactical level air game. Very deep on details and a thriving online community. The only downside for me is I sometimes struggle to find the relevant rules in a situation. Anybody contemplating the game but unsure of the commitment needed should try the free Quick Start version.

The Fighting Wings series is the most detailed WWII air combat boardgame system.

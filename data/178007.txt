A strange game in that it is kind of a Euro/Ameri-trash hybrid in every sense. I guess the phrase is a "thematic Euro" which I thought was an Oxymoron, but here you are...

The theme is really cool and you feel like you are fighting for your life. Placing the dice to perform certain actions is a great idea. At the end of the day, this is a cooperative puzzle. The ability to solve it will depend on lucky rolls, so this may be a game with a limited audience: most Eur-ah-gah-mers hate luck and most Ameritrashers hate self-determining puzzles.

Me? I kind of like it. But it is one tough puzzle to crack.

Clever card based enemy mechanic makes you plan a few steps ahead. Provides a good challenge and using dice for actions makes you have to think about the best way to squeeze the most out of your turn.

Initial Impression: This game is a puzzle in a box. The components are fine, with the 3D aspect of the pillars adding to the overall experience. The only thing missing is standees/minis for the enemies. Although the dice-based actions make the game seem like a luck-fest, there are usually methods to mitigate unlucky dice rolls. Being able to share dice with teammates makes this a very cooperative game. Teamwork is essential in order to survive in this game. This game reminds me of Ghost Stories but with a preferable theme. Overall I enjoyed my first session, which I found tense, excitinig, and fun.

Slightly disappointed in this one.  The core dice system is interesting but the resolution on the board lacks tension and consists of a very heady, unwinding of timing.  Reminds me of the Neuroshima Hex battle resolution but you have to do it every turn and evaluate it painstakingly.

Remains unplayed to date. The game has entered the collection as the result of a discussion on flaws in Ghost Stories: Apocalypse Chaos is rumoured to put decisions [i]after[/i] dice rolling. And indeed it does. Now to get it played...

[b]Update[/b] Not the experience I was hoping for. The gameplay is annoyingly calculative, with players being asked to carefully take stock where enemies will appear and how much damage they will do to the play area. Players can then assemble the dice on their boards to maximise damage while taking the least amount of hits. This is what computers were developed for. 

And yes, (nearly) everything is deterministic once the dice have been rolled. But you are at the mercy of the buggers just the same. At times there is simply no avoiding being caught in the crossfire of the hellbeasts, and the damage dealt to you is lethal in a turn or two. Given that healing is in very short supply... you get the idea. Okay, players can add their shield power together, but that presupposes you actually rolled shields, and can be together most of the time. I suppose the idea is then to use a room ability for an 'emergency' action of sorts. It all makes for very opportunistic Duckduckgo-play which wears out its welcome very quickly.

It's likely me, but over time I've grown to dislike coops more and more; especially if they think it is a good idea to jack up the difficulty level to a very challenging degree in order to lure people back for more. [i]One more go! This time we'll beat the game![/i] Sorry, but no. Apocalypse Chaos appears to be no exception to this rule, and so I will not continue experimenting with it.

[b]Update the last[/b] Let the game go.

I like this game quite a bit.  It is a programming game, in that after you roll the outcome of the round can be predetermined and other possibilities can be puzzled out.  I like to solo it with 4 characters, and enjoy the fact that it has a campaign with the possibility of user made missions or even user made campaigns.  I do think it could use a little bit more content in terms of enemies and equipment.

RATING: 7
I like the way enemies flip to become boons once you kill them  I think I will like the puzzle of this game.   

First reactions from the rulebook: There are some major points of confusion in the rulebook.  Be sure to see the Rules thread here where the author has been fantastic with clarifications. Also, solo play with 1 character looks like it will be relatively uninteresting because there is not much  you can do about your dice roll.  I'll use at least two characters (after first play or two) so there is potential for dice swapping.

Played a couple solo games.  As I expected, you'll want to use at least 2 characters.  This is a very puzzly tactical combat game, and it is pretty good.  It reminds me of Space Hulk and Assault on Doomrock, but is quicker to play than either of those games.  The games are nicely balanced and pretty tense.  The enemies turning into equipment will you kill them is quite enjoyable.  However, I feel like sometimes bad die rolls can really mess you over.  Not my favorite in the genre, but still pretty darn solid.

Apocalypse Chaos is some sort of puzzle version of Space Hulk: Death Angel. I recommend solo play with two characters and trying the missions campaign. The game is fun, tense, brain burning (but not too much), material is really good and design is nice. And I'm totally in love with the graphics from Lorenzo.

RATING: 8
First off, the rule book is not good. You'll need to check the forums for clarifications so you are able to play correctly. But after you get those clarifications, this is a very nice puzzly thematic rampage.

This reminds me of Ghost Stories but is, in my opinion, better. It has an interesting balance between the feeling of being relentlessly run over but still being able to fight back surprisingly efficiently. It is a very satisfying game to beat.

Only played solo so far. Will revisit the review after playing with other people.

This is probably the most difficult coop game I own. So far I've only won once which was with the skin of my teeth. And I still love it.

The game looks amazing. The colorful dice are a nice touch, the 3d aspect of the board is pretty unique and the artwork and theme are all great.

Each turn in this game is a real puzzle as you have to figure out what every enemy is going to do and how to deal with that best. It can get a bit too much with more players when enemies are swarming everywhere, so I'll just play with 2 or solo.

I have only played it as a two-player game. Each turn is a mini puzzle, where short term vs long term goals has to be considered. Has great use of dice.  It's a fairly difficult co-op (except when playing with the cryoscan room, then it's a cakewalk). Fits in the same category as Ghost Stories.

Was not for me. Way to puzzle-ly for my tastes but not in the vein of Roll Player or even Legends of Andor, that bad type of puzzle where one little mistake will bite you in the butt 3 turns later.

Fun solo game when I'm in the mood for a good brain burning sort of puzzle. The bits are a little fiddly and the truly solo (one hero) mode is just not as rich as soloing with two heroes, which is a shame since controlling two heroes burns the brain out much, much faster. All in all, it will definitely remain in my solo rotation.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2017)

As is usual from me, I bought Apocalypse Chaos without knowing anything about it. I bought it on a sale a long time ago. When I read the rules, it was a surprise to find out it was a cooperative game.

The rules of the game aren’t too complex, but there are lot of rules and each player has a different power, so you can explain the game under 20 minutes. Playtime depends on the scenario (or on how quick you die) but gameplay keeps flowing at a fast pace.

The game´s components are very good as is the art. Once you assemble an scenario to play, the game looks gorgeous on the table with its multilevel floors. The art is pretty good as well. The custom dice are very good.

The theme is great, I love it. Best with 3 players, but I would think it plays very well with 2 players as well. With 4 players the downtime is excessive. It also has a solo mode if you like that sort of thing (I don’t).

Apocalypse Chaos is a hard game to win as any good cooperative game should be. The game´s decisions aren’t obvious. All your actions depend on the dice you and your teammates threw, so it has a healthy luck factor in it, however, there seems to have many ways to mitigate the luck of the dice, so I’m not sure if luck is decisive or not. You have to calculate and plan a lot to succeed in this game and that bothers some people.

Once you assemble an scenario, it can be hard to read the cards from the other side of the structure, but perhaps, this part of the game is good to the cooperative effort, no player control all the information at a glance. 

I really like that the game comes with a campaign mode, I would like to play through it but I, most likely, won´t.

It is hard to see the info on the other side of the structure, but perhaps that part is good to the cooperative effort, no player controls all the information easily and players have to really cooperate.

I would have thought the game to be much more recognized as I think it is a good cooperative game and many players would love it. I´m surprised it didn’t have more buzz, perhaps it is an underrated game.

Bottom line, Apocalypse Chaos is a quirky and innovative cooperative game. Last year I would have kept it among my collection but I’m trying to reduce it to a manageable level so I sold it. Still, I think it is an ok to good cooperative game, but my desire to play it again isn’t that high.

Very nice game. The difficulty level is well balanced and you might win sometimes. It become's harder as number of players increase but if you keep the player interaction things will work betar.

The theme is strong and the characters are very cool! Their special abilities helps a lot and star entry dice is just perfect for each one!

I believe this is an underrated game because not much people played it.

Rating after a few solo games (playing as two characters). It works very well solo. It is very hard and I haven’t even beaten the introductory game yet, but I have been getting better. This game is very puzzley. It will make your brain burn. It is a bit like a tower defense game since you have to keep your Pilar’s up. The way the dice are handled for your actions is really neat. I love the art. It is also easy to set up and start playing, but I recommend a storage solution for the damage tokens since you will be using those a lot.

-It is a mentally taxing solo game, because it presents some tough decisions each round.
-Quick setup and tear down time.
-There is no wasted space in the box so you aren’t wasting precious storage space on a box filled with air.
-Works very well solo playing as two characters. 
-Fantastic art.

Quite a heady game. The frequency at which enemies spawn and the limited actions to fight them with give this game the slowly spiraling doom feeling that I enjoy fighting against in co-op games. The aesthetics are appealing and the way in which enemies activate (mixing up moving, attacks and special abilities on an enemy-per-enemy basis) does a fantastic job of capturing the chaos of being under assault by forces of unknown strength. The ability to share dice around balances out the randomness of the rolls to give it a decent feel of strategy. Definitely cleverly designed, it remains to be seen how much replay value this has!

Despite discovering a missed rule or a misinterpretation of a rule, the game is a fun little coop puzzle where each round players have to decide the best allocation of their dice to do the maximum amount of damage while taking the least amount of damage. 

There are better games out there if your interest is just blasting baddies; this game emphasizes being efficient with how you use your dice and that may mean some players will go turns watching others fight while they manipulate rooms or activate special abilities. 

I believe the game works better with two players than a bigger group; but your mileage may vary.

This is for puzzle fans only, each turn is going to enter you into a debate over best way to proceed. Doesn't really work with a single character, two is best. More than that and  the sheer number of bad guys vs. the number of potential dice options can lead to decision paralysis. Under appreciated but certainly not for everyone but hugely rewarding. Lots of replay-ability as tiles are double sided and set up is random to a degree. It's a shame there were no miniatures for the heroes but don't let that put you off. Manual is a bit of slog to go through but it's worth the persistence to grasp it.

I like co-op games and I like the theme for this one. It was too difficult for a new player (the aliens strength was too much), so I cheated by reducing alien strengh -1 (to a minimum of 2) and by allowing 4 heroes in the same room.  It was still brutal. It seems the game is intended to be played with the campaigns feature.

Knocked the rating down by a point for the terrible rules which completely fail to explain key concepts. (For example, "LOS" requires straight lines; this is never mentioned in the rules). Still not sure how some things are supposed to work.

Slow paced, high-frustration, puzzle-feeling game where the "puzzle" consists of lots of numbers to analyze. Dice provide possible actions. Tendency to keep trading dice to the same key hero means some players often have a lot less to do.

Co-op strategic dice allocation.  Sci-fi ship defense represented by a literal 3-D structure of modular room tiles. Scenario based or build your own missions. Variable player powers. Each player rolls a pool of special symbol action dice to place and share on their player boards. Spawning points for alien cards that have programmed actions on card. I like the co-op feel from sharing dice and coordinating actions to activate rooms and defeat threats including a mechanic to delay your action to control timing. I'm not a big fan of the 3-D games.

A puzzle-tower defense game. There are so many way to assign the dice, the more heroes the more choices. I find it easier to write down the enemies attacks on each tiles on a paper. Then you can figure it out which tile you better be on, and how many shield you need. 

I've played mission 1-5 so far and most of the time I found myself spending dices on defend and walk rather than attack (especially on mission2-5). In fact, I can win easily without having to attack enemies at all. 

Updated: ok, after playing  all 7 missions from the rule book, I found out mission 2-5 are more like walk to the objective and walk back mission. While mission 1,6,7 encourage more fight.

Pi mal Pflauman is essentially a bidding game in that the highest value card played to each trick gets first choice of a card to keep.  The plum cards are an effort to compensate the player with a hand full of low cards, who hasn't much hope of getting the card he wants.  The game's interest lies in the play of low value cards with actions so that they don't blow up in your face (the steals) or help another player too much.  There's something there but it doesn't feel quite enough.

The rather lovely artwork looks like it came straight from the pages of an old fashioned botanical guide.  Card quality is good.

RATING: 6
A basic "play and collect cards" game with some hidden depth.  In this game, in turn order, players play a numbered card from their hand until all players have played their cards.  The numbers then determine the order in which each player collects one of the cards played in that round.  

Why collect some cards rather than others?  In addition to each card having a number on it, each card also has a type of fruit depicted, and further, some cards additionally have special actions that you can take when you acquire them, or victory point conditions that can be satisfied with the card, these cards being essential to winning the game.

All in all, an interesting design, capably executed, but curiously, not a particularly tense or fun game to play, at least on first play.  Might deserve a second play to sense that hidden depth, which I am guessing, is there.

Simple rules but lots of interesting decisions in this unique blend of set collection, auction and trick taking game.    In my one game i got a lead going into the last round which made me a target and ended up finishing 3rd.  With experience I think I would want to have Pi's and the dog going into the last round and be willing to sacrifice a few points to get it.  Still a lot of fun and a game I will normally love to play - would work with gamers or casual players and with each it will take me a couple of rounds to get into it.  Quick playing which is a bonus probably 40 min with newbies and 4/5 players and less with three or experienced players - probably under 30min which is a great time frame for something with this amount of fun.

A simple card drawing game. You may try to get some plans, but everything you do is just a matter of chances what appears on the table. Seeing only own cards in hand, you can't really foresee what may be available, also having better cards can't be easily countered.

It is an interesting twist on set collection, and does have good art. I thought the Pi cards were overpowered, as they give you up to about a 9.5 wild card to play on top of your number card, though you do have to use one of your six plays that round to get those cards. Have to play more to see if its actually balanced. I did actually like this better than Tichu, which was not nearly as intuitive in picking up cards and building sets to score.

Great, unique trick taker with lovely artwork and a quirky (pasted on) theme. Certain cards have effects/opportunities to score, and the winner of the "trick" gets the first choice of one card from the trick, rather than swiping all the cards. This is a large portion of the root of all strategy and dilemmas in the game and what makes it stand out from the other trick takers my group enjoys. Seems to be becoming a regular on game nights.

Set collection and trick taking game. The interesting twist being that the high bidder takes the card she wants. The positive modifiers gave a bit of spark, but the game felt overall like an exercise in card counting and deck knowledge. Which needs a lot of discipline to do in a game with 9 suits. The dog and steal actions felt like an afterthought. We played several times in a row and did not understand the reason for the deck distribution. The game did not feel exciting enough to invest in learning the deck, so at the end it fell flat. The art is nice, but the suit icons on the card corners are all the same color so not easy to distinguish fast, especially since the art on the cards does not coincide with the icons.

An ok game that I will not seek to play again.

The style and iconography of this game made me think it was going to be more difficult to grasp than it actually was. After one or two hands, we had easily got the concept, yet the strategy of what card to play when will take a few plays to master. It has a really nice flow of play, very satisfying trick-taking mechanic, interesting decisions and beautiful artwork. Plus Pi cards (which pleased my son), a cute dog (which pleased my daughter), and plums (which pleased all of us!). A lovely surprising gem of a game.

RATING: 8
This game takes a play or two to wrap your head around. The reason being: the cards you get dealt are NOT the cards you will have in your tableau.

This little detail makes the first play seem random and chaotic. Four plays later, and that could not be further from the truth. This game is GREAT!

Bonus 0.1 points for the dog card.

edit: Have now played this quite a bit (12 times at all counts including 4p partners) and layers of depth continue to unfold. We are starting to pay attention not just to counting card values, but also card types: specifically how many dogs or steals are left unplayed. This is the best trick-taking game I know.

a Matthias Cramer design, he of some great euros such as Lancaster, Rococo and Glen Moore. With Pi Mal the mechanic of the game is a straightforward trick taker and there are not even suits to follow. Highest card wins. The winner of the trick chooses which card from the trick he wants to keep for his set building. And that is the essence of this simple game. 

The sting in the tail comes from the powers that certain cards have, including some which allow you to steal from other players incompleted sets. Ouch.

So, it is easy to teach, easy to play, and full of venom. Terrific game.

After 1 Play: An interesting twist on trick taking games. Cards have values which represent turn orders, fruits which represent suits, and abilities to score of perform one of three other special abilities like steal, get turn order modifiers, or protect. 

There seems to be just enough take that in the cards to make you feel like you better use the cards you have in front of you, but no too much to turn this game into a random take that card game. 

The strategy of playing each of the three hands started to make sense by the end of the game. But from experience, don't misplay or miss a scoring opportunity because unless you have the dog...all your cards are belong to us!

Good game, excited to play it again. I could see this going up a bit, but probably not falling.

Adding variable powers to a trick taking game is an interesting idea, too bad the scope of the few here are limited and bland. As I'm sure others will of already mentioned, the artwork is lavish and really the selling point for the game.

It is an OK game if your only trick taking game, but it doesn't really hold up to others.

Very hard to control and very dependent on what you get on your hands even if there are interesting choices to make. They are highly tactical though and strategy can be obliterated by stealing or bad hands.

Wenn man das technokratische Wort "Mechanismus" bezaubernd nennen kann, dann in Matthias Cramers kleinem Stich- und Sammelkartenspiel PI MAL PFLAUMEN. Was für ein süßes Ding! Die Retro Art Direction der Früchte ist herausragend und eine Auszeichnung für Dennis Lohhausen beim Art Directors Club Deutschland wert. Die Schönheit, die sich zart in den drei Kartenstapeln von der Larve zum Schmetterling entpuppt, ist pure Liebe zum Detail. Hier hat der begleitende Redakteur den Mut gehabt, einem vergnüglichen Spielchen nicht den üblichen marktfähigen "Lustig-Look" zu verpassen, sondern durch das Old-Science-School-Artwork dem Spiel eine Ebene hinzuzuaddieren, die den Feingeist entzückt und PI MAL PFLAUMEN zu einem Kleinod macht, das sich sofort in mein Herz gespielt hat. Wer bis dato nicht wusste, welche Zahl sich genau hinter Pi versteckt, weiss es jetzt. Der kleine Flundi zum Beispiel.

Opinion: good filler to take with you and play when you have some time. With an appearance of a very simple game you have one with lot of interaction and more things to do than expected. Play well the cards to set the turn order, choose wisely the one you are playing so you can take the one you need, or mess the plans of others. Then take care of the formulas you have to complete to obtain VP's

Plums/Pi mal Pflaumen is a clever set collection game with a trick taking mechanism driving the collection.

Cards are played in three rounds of 5-6 tricks.  Cards have one of several fruits, and some show Sets of mixed fruit that can be collected and turned in for points.

Winner after three rounds is the one collecting the most valuable sets of mixed fruit.

Hm. I have to admit I was a bit disappointed by this, after hearing good things. Sure, it is very pretty, but I don't find the artwork functional at all. We played with five players which seemed too many to see the details of other players' cards. The central mechanism is auctioning rather than trick-taking, and the tasks to fulfill are, while somewhat balanced, fiddly and a bit unmotivated to me. So the game passed without too many highlights. For a somewhat similar concept (trick-taking and set collection) my desire to re-play Sapotagem is far greater.

とても精密に作られていて、ゲーマーがガチで遊んでもそれに応えることができるし、一方で気楽に遊ぶこともできる。トリックテイク風ではあるが、トリックをテイクするのではなく各自が出したカードのうち1枚を、数字が高いカードを出した人から順に獲得する。どちらかというと競りに近い。獲得したカードでセットコレクション。たくさんセットをコレクションして点数が高い人が勝ち。
スートがないため、どのカードでも出せる。よって、出す順番を選択することでゲームに参加するわけだが、出したカードがどういう結果を引き起こすかはプレイヤーの選択の結果というよりは、プレイの綾であるように感じる。ちゃんとカウンティングすれば読み切れると思うのだけれど、あまり競技的にゲームに向かうモチベーションがない。

Combine a dog, fruits and the pi number.  What do you get?  A card game called 'Pi mal pflauen'.  A twist on German expression meaning: 'roughly' or 'more or less'.

Kind of a trick-taking game but no player wins the trick. Instead, the value of the cards played determine the order in which players choose one of the played cards to put to their display. From the cards on display, sets have to be formed to gain points.

The artwork is neat, the gameplay is original and entertaining. It's difficult to say after one play how much influence the decisions have and what importance the dealt hand has. Okay for the time it takes but I rather play a real trick-taker instead.

There are some interesting mechanics, I like the idea that you keep some cards after each trick. But it's hard to figure out how to play those cards during the trick taking part to get what you want.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Not sure what to think exactly after one play with three players as it is a blend of trick taking and set collection (set collection being defined as collecting cards to fill a goal card in the game which is often part of that set). Each card won can only be used for one set. Also, there are cards that allow you to steal other players' cards and dog cards which protect you. The artwork is quite beautiful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Clever trick taking game with scoring based upon set collection of fruit cards. Scales well from 3-5 players. Beautiful artwork on the cards. (Though the filigree design on the sides of each card is unnecessary and distracting.) I like the pi cards as a way to manipulate the value of your card played for the trick, and the plum cards are a valuable consolation prize for choosing a card last. I've taught this game to about 10 different people and 5 of them subsequently ordered it. Of course, most of the fun in any game is who you play it with, so maybe my group that barked like a dog when the "dog card" was played happened to enjoy the game the most. :p

This game is great. It is increasingly getting played and I enjoy it more and more with each play. Definitely try it if you like fairly quick unusual trick taking / set collecting variant card games! But why oh why are they renaming it for the US market! "Plums" what a boring name, when did the world stop revelling in the unusual. "Pi Mal Pflaumen" is so much nicer!

Previous thoughts;
A Matthias Cramer card game which I knew I had to get as soon as it was announced. Then I heard the theme and I thought wtf, then I saw the artwork and thought WOW! This is a great game with fantastic artwork with a theme that takes longer to explain than the rules themselves.

You are collecting fruits to build fruit mixes (or fruit punches as we prefer in our household!) is the general theme of the game, furthermore dogs and the number Pi come into play as you would naturally expect!

It fills the perfect niche for me that I like in trick taking / set collection card games. This one is both and is fairly quick with an easy rules set that promotes interaction on a level that means you can plan to interrupt another players plans but it never seems overtly aggressive. I really like the way all cards have to be played in tricks to a central pool before they can be scored with drafting (talking) from the pool dependant on your position in the trick win order. This leads to some lovely light decision making that really suits a fairly quick card game.

One we plan to play loads more.

RATING: 8
An interesting trick-taking game that uses trick-taking gameplay to create an auction system.  The gist of the system is this: Each card has a number from 1 to 25 and a fruit.  The fruit is the game's "suit" but unlike most trick-taking games, there are no trump suits or following suits required here.

After everyone has played the card, starting with the player with the highest number and going down from there, each player takes a card used in that trick to add to their play area.  Some cards also have special abilities that trigger as soon as you acquire them.  These abilities are: Stealing a card, get three "Pi" cards, an objective, and Watchdog (prevents stealing).  The person who took the last card takes a "Plum card" as a free fruit.

The objective and Pi cards is what drives the game.  The objectives tell you what you need to claim that objective which can be anything from three of a kind or five different fruits.  Once you claim a card and complete an objective, you discard the required cards in your play area and put your objective facedown to signal that you have completed that objective.  Difficult and time-consuming objectives are worth more points than the easier stuff.

Pi Cards throw a curveball to the typical trick taking stuff.  After you play your normal fruit card, you can throw in a Pi card to add +3.14 to your card's number.  You can also play multiple Pi Cards (6.28, etc).  The reason for the decimal is to prevent ties.

With all these things mixed up, you have a game that constantly requires your attention and reading other player's intentions.  Trick-taking is an important aspect of the game, but it isn't the drive of the entire game.  I would go as far as saying that the trick-taking aspect is merely background prop for the bigger play going on.

Due to the auction style of gameplay and some cards having unique powers, the game does allow players to screw each other even by playing low cards. For example, you can throw in a card with a "steal" power to divert their attention away from a card you are keeping an eye on to complete your objective.  You also need to pay attention to other player's play area since you don't want to throw fruit down that helps them complete their objectives.

Would I ever own this game?  If I found it for $5 or $10 bucks, I would grab it, but otherwise, not really.  I would never turn down a game of this. It is an enjoyable and unique game with an awkward theme attached to it.

This is a game of collecting fruits to score the most points. It plays a lot like a trick taking game, only each player will receive a card at the end of each round, but the player who played the highest value chooses first. The player who chooses last, however, also receives a plum card. All cards feature one fruit or another, some cards also feature a special ability or bonus like the watchdog, the chance to steal a card from an opponent or to take pi cards in order to manipulate their card value at a later turn. Some cards feature scoring objectives, which requires the player to gather a specific distribution of same/different fruit types in order to score it. Plum cards can be used towards these objectives.

At the end of three seasons the player with the most points wins the game. It's simple enough to teach, fun to play and it looks absolutely gorgeous.

A pleasant bidding and bluff game, with a wacky twist in the ability to add pi to your bid score. Unfortunately the card draw is a bit too make-or-break, and I would like to see this played under 'Turn the Tide' rules, whereby everyone gets a turn with the same set of cards.

[b]Pi Mal Pflaumen[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I had one underwhelming play of this game, but it was late at night and one player couldn't have been less engaged. I love trick takers because they typically offer quick game play combined with an interesting decision space. The problem I have with Plums is the tacked on bits which prevent it from being a streamlined trick taker. 

- Player order cards kill the flow of the game and make it drag.
- Pi cards which eliminate skillful play since keeping track of who has which cards is rendered useless since they can bump up the value of their card with Pi cards. It makes the game easier for folks not used to trick taking games I guess, but just feels like an unnecessary novelty to me. 
- The dog If you want to include stealing in your game then don't nerf it with another card you have to keep track of. 

I did like the idea of adding set collection to a trick taking game and I'd like to play again. However; I'll no longer be seeking out a copy because it is somewhat clunky to play and I don't think it'd be nearly as good with three (which is a common number for me to play trick takers with). [/i]

1 play with 3 and I must state immediately that I'm pretty sure this is the worst number to play this game with. 1 player will have the watchdog and as long he/she has that, the stealing will be between the other 2, which makes the game has a very high take-that - feeling with 3.

RATING: 5
This is a beautifully illustrated game played over three rounds. Each round a stack of cards is divided evenly among players. Then each player in turn order plays a card. Then whoever played the highest numbered card gets first pick from the cards everyone played. Some of the cards have special abilities that activate when taken, and others have scoring criteria. After taking a card you are allowed to score. It's got enough depth and take that to be interesting and allow for somewhat flexible strategies. Determining when to play which card can make for some fun tension if you are the sort of person who likes trick-taking games. After a few plays I found I don't have it in me for the situations when all the cards you have fail to take anything useful hand after hand.

A thoroughly uninteresting game in my opinion. I won my first play but largely don't know why, nor does anyone else. I personally heavily doubt there is much depth here and I suspect that there is a pretty low cap on the level of skill. I don't think this game creates very tense or interesting decisions very often. 

On top of all that the artwork and theme really do not do it for me. In a rare circumstance I actually found it offputting--I'd rather have just had very plain cards with no theme whatsoever. 

Overall with a shallow gameplay, oddball unattractive theme, I'll be happy to never play again. I don't hate it so much I won't play it, but I'll never be suggesting it or excited to play it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Way too tactical for my tastes. It feels more like an auction game than a bidding game as players can't force other players to play certain cards.

Feels a bit like [gameid=12830] except more frustrating.

I wish there were some kind of pattern to the cards (i.e. the combination of rank, suit, and special action) so I could better gauge what cards are still out there.

David Parlett's [url=http://www.parlettgames.uk/oricards/cloudnine.html]Cloud Nine[/url] is similar but way more satisfying: More intuitive, deeper, more tense, and more strategic.

--May2016-- It's quite cute.  Though after a single play, I'm not confident I'm happy with the take-that elements.  It seems (very naively) that one is occasionally more motivated to steal a card from someone who is losing (rather than a strong competitor) because of the utility of the various available cards.  And that's not quite a pattern I'd want to encourage.   (I could be wrong of course;  I might only be seeing an artifact of groupthink and bad play, too.)

It is pretty.

Enjoyable 30 minute bidding game. A lot depends upon the cards you are dealt and the turn order, but there's also enough control not to turn me off with the luck of it all. My question with these games is how much of a choice do I have each turn and how much does it matter what I choose? Well it turns out that how you play, if you want to play well, is guided by what you're dealt, but there's a lot left to reading the other players, what they have in front of them and a touch of memory to boot.

It's rather a fun 30 minutes, or less, and the game is blissfully easy to teach. Not a bad little card game to throw in the travel bad with playing with the infrequent gamer crowd.
----------
Several more plays in now and we are really enjoying this one. There's a lot of jostling for turn order and eyes on the cards that have been played already. Much more depth to the game than we first saw. On top of which it's fun! Good stuff!

Supposedly a trick taking game which isn't a trick taking game (at all). It's a bidding game of collecting sets with scoring cards also being part of the bidding - usually with a low nominal value. Uhm, that's pretty it - you go though 3 "ages" and for each you get a new hand of cards from a special deck for that round. Mostly a tactical game of timing and combinatorics. Themeless, but the visual style is unique and kinda nostalgic. 

All in all the game is kinda on autopilot and while passes the time, there's no real group dynamics, psychology or long term plans. The whole thing is driven by card powers.

It's not a bad trick-taker (sort of), and the artwork is beautiful, but it's not great either. I'd certainly play this again but it isn't something I would seek out, especially since I don't really play many trick-taking games these days.

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are 3 decks of cards, one used each round. Each deck has uniquely numbered cards showing a type of fruit each (10 fruits total?). Each trick, players in turn play a fruit card (plus any number of pi cards, each of which add 3.14 to your card value). In descending order, each player claims one of the played (non-pi) cards (also, this sets turn order for next hand; in a 4er game the last player gets a bonus plum card). Some cards are also contracts, showing a scoring pattern (e.g., AAA, AA BB) -- you may fulfill these when you get the appropriate fruit combo. Others have a special action (e.g., take plum card from supply, steal a card from an opponent, take the dog to protect yourself from theft, or take 3 π cards from supply) which is executed immediately. All collected fruit cards are placed in your personal display (sort by type). 

The round ends after x turns (varies by player count). After 3 rounds (hands), score VP according to completed contracts. The player with the most VP wins!

[Pegasus Spiele 15 edition] {Flowers; set-collection; optimal 4p} Pi mal Pflaumen is a weird game.  It has both Pi and Flowers in the same game, which is not really related.  Using "Pi" to increase card value looks artificial...

It's not a conventional trick-taking game.  Players need to follow suit (there is no suit at all).  There is no trumps, etc.  It balances the advantages of high card with an additional Plum card for the player with smallest card in a trick.  Every card will be used in a hand; so, players can count cards in a play and adjust their moves.

Players have to get the best score in 3 rounds.  Each round, 24 (value 1 to 24) cards will be played.  Players selects cards in a trick in descending value of cards played.  Players have to collect cards that would give them combo scores.  Some cards will provide additional actions (such as defending, additional Pi cards, or stealing opponent's card).   Player interaction is good.   I don't think it's possible to adjust your card play (only 6 cards in a round) in order to avoid your opponent get the cards they want.   Only the player played last have more meaningful options.

The illustration is beautiful.  There are unique flowers on the cards.

RATING: 8
Beautiful artwork. The game itself is tricky. More bidding than trick taking, reminiscent of [thing=192][/thing]. We play cards sequentially, then in descending value of cards played, we each take a played card face up in front of us. All cards have a fruit (suit), some cards also have an action, for now or later. Some actions attack or defend, some give other bonuses, other actions enable you to score fruit sets you've collected. Getting the scoring cards is obviously vital, but its often hard to predict which card you're going to be able to take.

tl;dr: to mean for me

How many numbered-suited-cards games does one need? The answer is: as many good ones as one can find! So if one comes out with great artwork and is has [person=34699]Cramer's[/person] name on the box, I take note.
So, pretty straight forward: everyone plays one card, highest card chooses first from the played cards and you try to collect certain fruits based on the goals printed on some of those cards. There's some special actions tied to some of the cards, to switch things up a bit. One of those actions is stealing cards. And to my feeling there was a bit too much of that going on in our 3-player game. Maybe it's better with more players, but this first play wasn't what I was hoping for.

Really needs at least four players. With three players it's possible that the cards don't get spread around enough, and the "thief" cards that let you steal from another player can have a much bigger influence on the game at lower player counts.

Fun game. It's sort of like a trick-taking game, which is a genre that I love, but not quite. Each player plays any card from their hand, and then those cards get split up in order of who played the highest card. So you really have to think about what you're going to play and when to play it. You might have a card in your hand that you really need, but if it's a low value then you're less likely to be able to claim it for yourself. But if you throw it out when other players are playing valuable cards, you might be able to sneak by and get it as other players take even better cards.

There's just nothing that really makes this stand out over other simple card games. I've got plenty of excellent trick-taking games, plenty of excellent simple "colors and numbers" card games, so even though this game isn't bad it won't be staying in my collection.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 4-5[/b]
The game needs at least four players. Otherwise the cards don't get spread out enough and the game is far less interesting.

RATING: 7
I had seen this game being played but didn't know anything about it. It looked interesting enough that I wanted to try it.

First off, what an odd combination of choices... the title, which is apparently a play on the phrase Pi Mal Daumen, which means "rule of thumb". But I'm not really sure why it's a play on that phrase nor why that phrase should be the title at all. Apparently, there's now a version called Plums... which is only slightly better as a title. And the game description mentions Maria Sibylla Merian a naturalist and artist whose illustrations were apparently the inspiration for the art style of the game (which is lovely by the way). It also mentions Leonard Euler (pronounced "Oiler"), and hey... kudos for mentioning a famous mathematician, but thumbs down that the only thing in the game that is mathematical is Pi. And Pi is an odd duck in this game. It literally has no tie to the rest of the theme at all.

All that aside, the game is about collecting fruit cards. Some of those cards also give you special abilities or scoring opportunities. Each stage (there are 3 stages with 5 rounds each in a 5 player game) you have a hand of 5 cards, which you will play over the next five rounds. The cards have various fruits on them and are numbered from 1 to 25. Each round, players play a card to the trick clockwise from the start player. Then players are assigned an order in terms of who played the highest card. In that order, they each take a card from the trick to their tableau. As they take their card, they have the opportunity to score any of their cards. A card might allow them to score 5 points for having two pairs of matching fruit. The scoring card goes into their scoring pile and the rest of the cards are out of the game.

There are also cards that allow you to steal a card from another player's tableau, guard your tableaus, get plums, or get Pi Cards (which can be played with your numbered fruit cards to increase their value by 3.14 each).

The game is interesting and I enjoyed it. I had a bad break on the last round when four different scoring cards came out, and I was the first person to draw a card to my tableau. Despite many scoring opportunities, I just barely wasn't able to qualify for any of them... and any of them would have given me the game. So luck can be a bit of an issue, but it's a fairly short quick game, so that's okay.

Beautiful artwork - the fruit looks edible. Stunning. Game is an excellent trick taking game. Maybe I should rate it higher but unfortunately trick taking games just don't get the table time they deserve.

Unique and beautiful looking game, that has a structure that takes a while to get used to.  My in-laws had some problems grasping some of it.   Needs more plays.

The theme is great, and the art is pretty. I typically enjoy trick-taking games. I would give this one a higher rating if it didn't employ stealing from other players as a game mechanism.

"Rule of thumb" trick taking card game for sets of fruit. Time when to add your "pi" cards to bump your bet. Highest value to lowest determines draft order to grab fruits for points. Stinker gets the plum as a consolation prize. Dog wards off card theft.

I rather like this one.  It's like [GAMEID=19857] only better.  Plays pretty fast and is prone to similarly crazy combos.  I like having a common offer for buildings.  Give this one a shot - it's pretty good.

Uchronia simplifies Glory to Rome and eliminates the over-powered combos.  The artwork improves hugely on GtR's juvenile cartoon characters.  I even find the classical dinosaur civilization re-theming quite amusing.  

So, what's not to like? It feels to me as though, in smoothing off GtR's rough edges a lot of the fun in this game has ended up in the sawdust.  What's left is by the numbers tableau building, with a touch more player interaction than is usual in this genre.  Perfectly painless, but not very compelling.

Very good card game. It is a pity that everyone compares it to Glory to Rome. Uchronia is quite different from GtR. It is more steamlined which means that it is easier to teach it. I also like that they got rid of the vault and the game ending buidings. The artwork looks nice, inviting you to try the game.

Despite its somewhat mediocre ratings, I knew I was going to like this game, but then again, I love Glory to Rome, which is one of only 3 games that I rate a 10.  I still prefer GtoR, but Uchronia is a worthy mod.  It's a bit easier to pickup for new players and the art is much better.  I'll have to play it a few more times to be sure, but right now, I'm not in favor of the rule changes that reduced player interaction and the power of combos.  But then again, if they didn't change that, not sure why you'd bother ....

I guess the designer had to redress his previously popular game, Glory to Rome in a completely different outfit. The sad part is that the outfit is an incredibly heavy step in the wrong direction. A game that was initially developed as streamlined became needlessly bloated by weird iconography/terminology and really odd design choices. Two different card types, orange and red, have internally inconsistent color consistency, greying the distinction between some cards if lighting isn't perfectly clear. The building cards are some non-standard card size. They are needlessly huge without utilizing the space for text that can be read more easily. 

One thing that can be said about this game over GtR for some people, is that the game is less chaotic. If I wanted a stable engine building game with a pasted on theme, there are plenty that are better. As it's own game, the mechanics are sound. Without the existence of GtR, I'd say this is a quirky, lighter Euro with questionable component choices. Since GtR exists, I tend to want to play that when I play this game.

RATING: 8
Full disclosure: I have not played Glory to Rome, so for all I know that was a much better implementation of these game mechanics. However, I do really like this game, the dinosaur/utopia theme is a little vague in the details, but I like how players distribute cards about their domain, produce buildings with the resources, and take other Orders like hindering other players with Draconians. Good design.

Glory to rome v2.0 with many common mechanics.
Most prominent change is that there is a dedicated buildings offer. This is a game where the number of players plays a major role I think. I would definetely not recommend the game with 2 players, 4 would be the sweetspot, 5 would create much downtime.

Simpler, pared-down version of Glory to Rome. Looks great as you expect from Iello, slightly odd mixture of themes (Roman dinosaurs?), but it kind of works. I much prefer GtR, however - in Uchronia, the buildings are on seperate cards from the resources which removes that great dilemma that you get in GtR about how best to use your cards. Perhaps useful as a learning tool before stepping up to GtR, but I doubt it will get much play in comparison to its big brother.

I like this as much as I loathe Glory to Rome (although I'm told Uchronia is Glory to Rome dumbed down ... guess I'm a dummy then).

Only downsides are I think some of the buildings are really really good (much better than others) so grab one and you're set, and the game is colour-blind unfriendly :( I really can't differentiate between 'yellow' and 'orange' buildings unless they're both on the table next to each other, really frustrating, especially in low light.

In the category of retreads by Chudyk, I place this game significantly below Glory to Rome, but better than Mottainai.

Here's the thing, it is, even though the rules are much shorter, harder to learn than GtR. Why? I think it's because the boards are not as informative (or perhaps too informative) and the two sets of cards, instead of only one.

Also, the buildings are very texty and in the middle.

The game plays faster though, as turns are very very quick (the downside is, is that there is much less playing off of each other, making the game much more individual).

Unlike GtR, but similar to Mottainai, very few cards are broken, many are nearly useless, but some are very powerful.

You'll build quite a few buildings before the game ends, so you'll have quite the array of powers, and after you get half a dozen cheap powers, it does start to add up. But it doesn't give you that heady feeling of omnipotence that GtR gives you.

The physical implementation of the game isn't great either. My boards are warped. The tiny cards, of which there are many, are impossible to riffle shuffle, so shuffling is a Sisyphean task. And the buildings are very very texty and hard to read unless they are in your hand, but being a shared resource, they are in the centre of the table, so everyone wants to pick them up to read them, which slows the game down. Finally, the red and orange are a little similar, which is a problem because the red buildings don't actually match either shade, and the bricks at the bottom of every card are identical, regardless of colour, making it tough at times to figure out which cards are associated with which material.

I like Glory to Rome quite a bit, but I don’t care for Innovation or RftG. Uchronia is definitely closer to GtR than the other two games and I don’t think you need to own both unless you’re a huge fan of either. Anyway, Uchronia was an enjoyable game! The designer is the same who created Glory to Rome and in my assessment of the game I will have to compare the two. 

Uchronia is lighter than Glory to Rome but not by a huge margin. Even though it felt like it used the same overall mechanics as GtR, I think the designer still managed to create a somewhat unique game with a different feeling about it. I think the overall reason is that the interaction is lower than in GtR and that the winning condition is completely different from GtR. In GtR you play a certain number of rounds until the building foundations run out at which point you calculate your scores, whereas in Uchronia you play until the first player reaches 15 points at which point he or she immediately wins. 

As I said, the interaction in Uchronia isn’t as big as in GtR because everybody does not get to follow the action you choose for yourself. There is still lots of interaction, mind you, both in the overall goal in which you can steal some bonus cards from your opponents and in general with the various buildings.

Currently I do not own this game, but this might change depending on the price. My first hand impression is that it isn’t as good as Glory to Rome, but I do think it was a really interesting game which I would happily play again.

I'm so glad they made this game. Producing a game so similar to Glory to Rome was a risk, but I say it was worth it. Fantastic game. I find it a little heavier than San Juan but a bit simpler than Glory to Rome and Race for the Galaxy.  The rules are a bit rough. Don't try to come to a perfect understanding before you start.  Reading the supplied player boards helps as you go.

EDIT: I still like the game but we felt we needed to play with a variant. Occasionally, the game can bog down way too much due to lack of foundation cards in the forum. This can lead to very defensive play and a tedious experience, in my opinion. My variant is that you could discard two matching cards from your hand and a third matching card in the forum to form a wild and serve as a foundation of choice.

This game is grossly underrated.

1. Turns  are relatively short and sweet.  This is a HUGE bonus.
2. Even though this ^, you can still play turns that are hugely satisfying.
3. Play time is at the sweet spot--For experienced players, 30-40 minutes for a 2-player, add 10-15 minutes per additional player.
4. Strategy and planning are also at a fun and engaging depth--deep, but not drowning.
5. There is minimal negative player interaction. By negative, I mean the "Half my fleet just got wiped from the board" variety. Player interaction isn't always pleasant, but you can always recover from it relatively quickly.
6. The artwork is cool.
7. It's a great game in a little box--without a doubt one of my favorites!

Other stuff:
-One the whole, there's not a lot of direct player interaction.  However, you must watch what other players do on their turns to be more successful on your turn.

-Not much to offer in the way of theme--more of a race for points.  This is normally a killer for me, but not at all here, since everything is so nice to look at.

-There can be a lot to keep track of as far as options on your turn with activities, structure bonuses, and monopoly bonuses.

-The orange and red colors are too similar. This is not an issue for me, but has been for others I play with.

-After many plays, I do not find the imbalance of power among the buildings an issue.  In fact, I think it's a strength of the game overall.

Glory to Rome with dinosaurs.

Wait, what?

That isn't even in the top five odd decisions this reimplementation makes.  The resource cards are tiny.  Two of the five card colours are orange and a slightly redder orange.  The building cards, which are now placed on the table, are huge and square, but the font size means you're constantly having to pick them up to read them.  There's also a bunch of production issues, like misprints and unclipped card corners.  Essentially, the whole thing feels like a rush job.

The Rome + dinosaurs artwork is kind of insanely great, though.  Kudos to the artist for rolling with it.

Every single play in Glory to Rome is a tough decision, but by Uchronia divorcing the building cards from the resource cards, much of that tension is lost.  You can always draw another blue resource.  You might not draw that awesome building that fits your strategy again.  But the player to your left just lead a Merchant and you really need a Merchant and what're you going to do, hotshot?  What are you going to do?

I never felt that tension in Uchronia.

Uchronia would be better for children, and people who dislike the controlled chaos of Glory to Rome might prefer it, too.  But for me, the choice is easy.

[b][FirstImpression/PlayOnApril7th2014][/b] The game shares a lot of similarities with Glory to Rome although it's a different game. The main difference now is that material/action card is now separate from building card.

A lot of confusion when we played the game, most probably because we weren't familiar with the rule, and also because the owner himself wasn't that familiar too (probably he hasn't play the game before).

I find it to be okay, although I don't see the point of owning both this and GtR.

The action/material cards are awfully small, the two building colours (namely wood and clay buildings) are almost similar and the game is not colour-blind friendly (my friend is). They could have at design a unique symbol of each material type instead of using a single symbol for all types of material.

Explaining Uchronia in GtR terminology:

Players start with 6 cards and each player discards 1 card to the pool.

On their turn, players either lead or think.  

When players lead they place their order card(s) on their camp.  The order card doesn't go into the pool until the beginning of their next turn.  Other players are not allowed to follow or think when a player leads.  In addition, there are no Jacks in Uchronia but you can play 2 identical actions to perform any action.  When you perform your action, it's boosted by patrons.  

When you think you might have the option to perform a single action.  If an opponent has a card on their camp and you have a patron matching their order, you may do that action once but it's not boosted by patrons.  Regardless of whether you copy an order or not, you will draw cards to your hand limit (starts at 5) or 1 card if you're at your hand limit.

Buildings abilities have been separated onto their own cards.  There are no site cards.  There are 5 building cards available in a row and when one is moved to a players area for construction, a new building is revealed so there is always 5 available.  If 5 buildings of the same color are in the display, they're discarded and a new 5 are revealed.  There is only 2 of any given building regardless of the type of material they are constructed from.  All buildings of a particular material type take the same number of material to complete as GtR and they are worth the same number of victory points (ie wood 1 material & vp, etc).  There is no influence on your camp.  That said players can only have a number of patrons on their camp equal to 2 + # of buildings they have completed construction.

The other cards still have materials and patrons on them.  They also have useful iconography for what the actions associated with each patron do.  The five actions cards are as follows:

-Move cards from the pool to your stockpile
-Move cards from your hand to your stockpile
-Move cards from your stockpile to your patrons
-Choose a building from the building display and put it in your 'to be constructed area' and discard a matching colored card from the pool [b]OR[/b] add a resource from your stockpile to a matching building that's in the process of being constructed.  If you have patrons of this type, you can mix and match those two options but buildings have 'Construction Sickness' and can't have materials added to them the round they are put into your play area.
-Basically Legionary with these differences: (1) If a player doesn't have a card on their camp (ie they did a thinking action instead of leading on their turn) they are immune to the action and do not have to provide you with a card. (2) It effects all players who have a card on their camp, not just their neighbors. (3) You take a number of cards from the pool cards equal to how many cards you show which is based on your patrons as long as they match the type and quantity.

There is no vault on your camp.  What Uchronia has in place of the Vault is Monopolies which works as follows:  When you have more patrons of a specific type than any of your opponents you gain a monopoly of that type.  When you have a monopoly each patron of that type is worth 1 VP.  In addition, when someone completes a building of the type of monopoly you have, you take a card from the pool that matches that color.  If someone matches a player in patrons, the monopoly does not go back to the supply.  The player must exceed the opponent in patrons to steal the monopoly.

VP's are calculated in real time based on the following: monopolies, completed buildings, and building abilities.  When a player hits a threshold of VP (based on the number of players) the game ends on the last players turn... Basically the player at the beginning of the of the game that's designated as the first player gives a 'Last Turn' card to the player who's last in turn order.  The person with the most VP at the end wins.  Ties are broken by number of buildings in play.  Rejoice in shared victory if the number of buildings are the same.

[u]Opinion[/u]: I enjoyed it but it seems less interactive than Glory to Rome due to no following and the buildings seem more tame by comparison but we only saw 2 different types of red buildings.  I like the Monopoly system a lot more than the Vault system.  I'm not sure how crazy the buildings are but I don't think there is an instant win or instant game ending building.  I would actually consider continuing to pit Uchronia against Glory to Rome if it were not for the following:

1) The fact that I can't sleeve the square building cards because I don't know of a manufacturer that makes square sleeves of this size and I don't care to do a lot of investigating to find them  The FFG ones don't fit and mayday doesn't make square sleeves.

2) The stack of non-building cards is huge (like 174 or something like that) and it's small cards.  I don't necessarily mind small cards in moderation (see Ora et Labora and Battlestar Galactica).  Shuffling mini-cards in that large of a stack is a pain in the ass.  It would even be a larger stack with sleeves.

Was better with 3 players, with 5 there was too much downtime. Maybe that would be fixed if everyone knows the game well enough. There are some nice functions on buildings, some of them are evil to other players. Game components deserve some complaint: there is huge pile of tiny cards that are very difficult to get shuffled and seemingly those square shaped building cards cannot be sleeved because there's no suitable sleeve in the market.

Take Glory to Rome and weaken every element of the game. Tada! You've got Uchronia. 

Too much player interaction? Now you don't discard your orders until the start of your next turn, so you get first dibs on them. More notably, you don't do anything on other players' turns. 

Clients too strong? Now you can do only do a single client "Follow" on your own Thinker action and each building only ups the client limit by 1, regardless of resource cost. 

Cards too complex? Well, now they no longer function as buildings, just roles and resources. And all the resources have the same image. And there are yellow, orange, and red colors/resources/buildings that are poorly distinguished from one another. 

Buildings too game changing? No worries, they're now "balanced", and they're laid out in a row for anyone to choose from. Oh, but someone has to have previously discarded the right cards to the pool to start building construction. 

Legionary too strong? Players who Thought in the last round are now immune.

Theme too relatable? Now there are dinosaurs everywhere. 

Glory to Rome was wonderful in how everything was dialed up to 11. Everyone was trying to break the system with overpowered combos or trigger the final scoring before someone else got their combo working, but the game was fast and exciting. Uchronia has none of that. It's boring, "balanced" drudgery.

I found this one flat and annoying. Flat in that while everything worked together in theory, nothing exciting was happening on the table. Just some rather mundane card play to build some buildings and get some points. No great ooomph that makes G2R what it is. Rather, it felt like a muted version of G2R. 

Especially annoying is that you have to un-learn some G2R tenets: DON'T put your role card in the pool at the end of your turn; the craftsmen equivalent DOES NOT put cards from your hand to a building; it goes to your stockpile instead. Several times I screwed up out of habit with G2R and my opponent had to correct me. Gah! Pass.

Azt olvastam róla, hogy egy butított Roma, ezért sokáig nem is érdekelt, de végül az első játék után azt kell, hogy mondjam, hogy nem teljesen értek egyet ezzel a véleménnyel. Tényleg nagyon hasonlít a Rómára, tényleg egyszerűbb, de mégse csak egy egyszerűsített Róma. Pl. kivették a követés lehetőséget, ezért teljesen más ízt kapott a játék. Közös poolban vannak az épületek, ami csökkentette a szerencsefaktort. Stb.
Nem mondom, hogy elsőre teljesen összeállt: úgy tűnt, hogy az építés akció, és így a hozzá tartozó activity mindennél sokkal fontosabb.
Kell még vele párat játszani, hogy teljesen kikristályosodjon a véleményem.

I used a friend's corner rounder on my building cards and have never looked back (although if people here hadn't pointed out the issue, I would probably not have given it a second thought).

Anyway, really enjoying this game and glad when it gets to the table.

This is a neutered Glory to Rome.  Same designer, different publisher.  The streamlined design was not enough to make up for the lack of the follow mechanic.  Now you are just waiting for your turn to come again like every other game out there.

RATING: 4.5
Fairly interesting mechanics, but the gameplay lacks in fun. It takes just a few buildings for a player to end the game, but a very long time to build them. Buildings seem to be either overpowered or practically useless. The actions themselves are also unbalanced (it seems obligatory to get a building activity as early as possible, for example). Furthermore, the cool theme of a Roman-like civilization with dinosaurs is totally wasted, as the game feels very abstract and the art is just average.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (May 2014)

Very reminiscent of Glory to Rome (obviously :D), still I prefer the previous game over Uchronia. I have come to heavily dislike variable cards offerings (Legendary, Resident Evil and Uchronia) because they aren’t fair to all players. Pure luck (tactics) if you are able to get the building you want in your turn. This doesn’t bother me on Glory to Rome (and RFTG) because you have access to many more cards, thus you have many options to pursue and consequently you can plan much more in those games.

Another turn for the worse, is that now players can´t “follow”. This simplifies a lot the decisions you need to think each turn AND the downtime begins to creep up because most of the time I don’t do anything unless it is my turn.

I need to play a lot more, but I feel luck has more influence here than in Glory to Rome, making Uchronia a worse game for me. Is only advantage over GtR is that it is a lot easier to teach (because it is lot simpler). Cool theme but I didn’t saw any dinosaur in the game. I hate square cards because I can’t sleeve them easily.

Bottom line, Uchronia suffers a lot when comparing it to GtR, still it is a good game on its own and I will play again in the future to review my opinion about the game. For now I won’t buy it.

2/5. Pretty art and some interesting concepts, but really fell flat. Some fiddly and hard to teach rules make it difficult to get to the table. Don't like the table presence or card typefacing (or square corners). Does have some interesting mechanics but it just didn't work for us.

Comments after 1.5 plays:

As a big fan of Glory to Rome (I rate it a 10), I was eager to try this out.  The artwork is much better than GtR, but there is a problem with matching the colors: it seems like the Red, Orange, and Yellow buildings are hard to distinguish.

As to the play, it took about half a game to get used to the slightly modified procedures and the totally new terminology.  

GtR has outrageous combinations, which is one of the main draws for me.  Uchronia seems much more sedate and linear.  It also seems to take a long time to make steady progress toward the goal. It seems to take around 90 minutes or more which is too long for this game.  Hopefully the time will decrease with experience.

RATING: N/A
In Uchronia, you are the patriarch of a great Uchronian noble house, competing with the other houses that commit their wealth to building the city, enriching it with new constructions, and striving to win over the people.

In game terms, players start with six resource cards in hand, then each discard a card to the shared forum; each resource card shows the type of resource (with color-coded five resources in the game), an activity icon (with, for example, all yellow clay cards showing a pick), and an order (with yellow showing Production). Five building cards are placed face-up in the Great Works area and can be built by the players; any time a building is taken from this area, reveal another building card.

Didn't much care for the store-room.  I'm sure it has been play-tested, but off the cuff that card feels very overpowered.  Most likely, this card could be devalued if everyone else is very careful about their actions, but I'm uncertain.  Outside of that, this is a bastardization of Glory to Rome which I think I prefer although this is definitely simplified and streamlined.  Also not sure how dinosaurs fit into the theme but whatever...:-)

I’m not sure I’ve ever played a complete game of Glory to Rome, the game this is a rework of. Every time I tried, it seemed to go on forever and was a learning game for someone. But there seemed to be something there, so a rethemed (though pointlessly so) and more streamlined version was something I was looking to try. This is certainly something I’d rather play than GtR, but it’s still a bit of a mess. It just plays like throwing as many things in as one can, hoping there’s a strategy game that comes out of it. It pretends like it’s in the same family as San Juan, but in reality it reminds me more of the dry piecemeal tedium of Agricola, where everything you want to do takes a million steps. Unlike Agricola, though, what stymies you isn’t so much the other players taking your actions but having the right cards in hand. (I’m starting to think that if you have a rule where you can use X cards of one type to represent a different type, maybe you need to re-examine why that rule is there.) A description of this as “San Juan on steroids” might be accurate, so long as you remember that steroids turn perfectly fine people into bloated, misshapen freaks.

Much better than I expected from the ratings here. That was to be expected because the game suffers from comparisons to Glory to Rome. However, I feel that Uchronia is quite good and also different enough in comparison to Uchronia. I'm happy to own both. Uchronia is much easier to teach and looks better than Glory to Rome, so I expect that I will eventually play this more.

Some negatives: the dinosaur theme is pretty much non-existant and the rather large box contains a lot of air and a useless insert. It seems Iello cut corners everywhere except on the cards.

Essentially, this is Glory to Rome lite. Where in GtR you get actions based on others actions, Uchronia distills this down much more so you get one action on your own and maybe bonus actions depending on how you set up your "Activities." The war mechanic is much more vicious in this game as opposed to GtR, too. I get this game much more quickly than it's predecessor, too. Not a bad game at all.

I've never played Glory to Rome, which I know this game has a lot of similarities to. I really like the aesthetics of this game, and its mechanisms. It's unfortunate that they didn't choose different iconography and made the colours more different as you can at times mistake one for another.

It's a game that is easy to teach, but requires a few games for people to really grasp the strategy, and an experienced player can really easily grab the upper hand when facing a newer player, so I think equal footing is especially important when playing this game.

The card-play and engine-building in Uchronia is really well-done.  There is not a lot of negative player interaction, and the negative interactions that exist are off-set by interesting "leeching"-like interactions.  This is a fine game, but the poor theming actually keeps it from shining.  I find it really hard to relate to this dinosaur-civilization theme, so I end up thinking of everything as just mechanical.

This is the game I wish GtR would have been.  I really believed a great game could have been created within the mechanics of GtR.  (I'm sure I'll be in the minority with that statement.)  I felt that GtR wound too far out of control with crazy combos leaving other players stranded in the wake of the leaders broken engine.  (That's not to say that you can't have great combos in Uchronia.)

Uchronia is far more streamlined.  It starts off slower, but creates a lot of tension towards the end of the game.  In addition, the production is far more superior than any version of GtR.

Heavily simplified Glory to Rome with severe usability flaws.

The usability issues include but are not limited to:
- Utterly horrible color scheme constantly disturbing the gameplay.
- Square cards with sharp corners.
- Microscopic font.
- Cumbersome scorekeeping.
- Poor box design.

The simplifications make the gameplay very dry and slow-moving. Separating roles and buildings to different decks also takes away a majority of the appeal of the original game, and the building effects seem watered down.

Game where rules are in the way first couple of games. After that it gets better and you can start seeing diffrent strategies and what buildings to go after and how and when to play your orders and monopolies. Good game which really seem to benefit a lot from repeated playings. (As the designer is same as on Innovation it just might be his way of doing things).

[i]I have been wanting to play this one for a while since I really like Glory to Rome. Personally I found this to be a far cry from GtR; in my opinion all of the tension and interesting card synergies are missing. The locations are all very lackluster and are just worth 1, 2 or 3 points with very generic powers. The worst part of the game is how poorly the theme is tied into the game.  Dinosaurs, awesome... except none of the theme comes through with any of the cards. 

This game was a major disappointment and not something I would seek out to play again.[/i]

I thought this was a leaner, cleaner and more elegant version of Glory To Rome. The cards are either an action or a resource that are used to build the buildings that now come on a different set of cards. It makes the game much easier to teach. This and the fact that you can't follow, and don't have to take that into account, make turns faster. Now you're just dealing with actions to acquire the buildings you want (building them and using their powers are key to success), get extra action capability, get the resources you need, and then build those buildings. There's a couple of other tweaks that add interest, but the game works well. At least now building powers are seeded to the board for anyone theoretically to get (seating order notwithstanding) rather than just being drawn randomly into your hand, which is definitely an improvement. It's maybe a touch too long for what it is, but then again that does give time for an engine to shine if you can build compatible buildings. Anyway, it's a version I'd happily play.

I enjoy this. Similar, yet different game than Glory to Rome. I like the 2 separate decks of Buildings and Orders. Artwork is really nice.

I think it plays faster than Glory to Rome, and it seems a better 2-player game.

I thought from people's comments that this game would be much lighter; I discovered that it is not, which is fine by me.

Production issues: Square corners on square cards. Off centered printing on the order cards.

This might be my 2nd favorite tableau builder next to 51st State. I still love Glory to Rome, BTW.

An "8" rating after one play. Could see this becoming as loved as Innovation and Impulse.

Component issues might keep it from becoming a 10.

Oct 2014: Played quite a few more games, including a few 3-player. Definitely a lot to explore here. I think I am starting to see it being a desired game, but it is lacking... something... that will keep it from ranking higher than an 8 for me. I'm not entirely sure what it is. I did pick up the promo cards for $13, and we tried a couple of games with them. They are cool, worth getting if you can get them cheap.

In two years, played 31 times. As of 9/23, we've been playing Draconians wrong. Discovered accidentally tonight. Raised this game to a "9". This will balance it and remove a problem we've had with red being under powered.

Not a great initial experience.  Chudyk's penchant for expansive and vague rules works against him here.  Innovation clicked almost immediately for us, so I was a little surprised that this one didn't.  
Admittedly, I screwed up the explanation for the game (thinking you could have as many cards at the top of your tableau as you wanted..not so), which made it frustrating.  I think if the rules had a slightly more comprehensive FAQ or some more examples, it would help tremendously.  
That said, cool theme, and I like Chudyk's games generally...so, I figure I'll give it another shot sometime. 

Update: Upon replay, the elegance of the mechanics began to show through, and it was much more engrossing and entertaining.  There seems to be a "winning strategy" of focusing on getting Building activities early, but I'm not certain it is necessarily the only way to victory. Still, it is a deep and rewarding game that requires some commitment. Improved the score by 1.5.

Leaving aside "missed opportunities" (red/orange similarity, imbalance in building powers, strange terminology and using identical symbols for 5 different resources), I like this - a lot.  Glory to Rome hasn't been out of the box in the three months since I first played Uchronia (even though the long wait for GtR should have meant that anticipation levels were sky-high).

Initial concerns about the length of the game have completely evaporated - with experience, players have realised that (a) they need to build (ideally as fast as possible), and (b) Activities are really powerful.  Games only bog down if players try to collect too many resources, rather than utilising the ones that they already have.  Even when the building stack throws up a lot of one colour which can't be built, games still only take 45-60 mins.

It's easier to teach than GtR, easier to play, turns are quicker (as there's no follow/think decision), but it still has a similar feel.

If there's one thing that's a bit odd, it's that Uchronia seems to get remarkably little attention compared to GtR, because it's the better game IMO.

Great card game. Better than Glory to Rome, in most regards. Definitely a suitable alternative until I can track down the black box edition. I would choose Uchronia first if it had better production quality. The player boards don't fit in the box and are made of flimsy cardboard, and the cards are basically unsleevable. Still, the game is good enough that I would buy another copy once this one wears out.

I will note that I believe it plays best with 3 or 4 players.

It's a sleeker more elegant version of Glory to Rome.  It takes the best bit of that game and simiplifies them, while removing the tracking mess that stops me playing Glory to Rome with more than 2 players as a rule.

This is a reworking of Glory to Rome, but I think I prefer the original -- I missed being able to do something on everyone's turn (there's no "following" in this game). This one certainly has a more acceptable art style, though, and should be easier to learn for newbies.

-Why are the cards in a format that doesn't fit any standard sleeve size?
-Why are resources only distinguishable by colour and all have the same icon? Unplayable for colourblind people.
-Why choose reddish and orangy that are friggin hard to tell apart as colours?
-Why does the play-aid have some critical information but completely omits other important stuff?
-Why rework Glory to Rome when both games end up the same: extremely brain burning while also egregiously random?

I picked this one up when Glory To Rome was out of print. It simplified some of the rules in such a manner that it feels solved. Use your cards, buy resources, turn them into buildings, win. The production outside of the artwork also looks and feels cheap. I wouldn't turn down a game but it is basically just a tactical display on how to use your cards to buy victory points and nearly meaningless specials. Basically it's a cube pusher but uses cards instead.

Glory To Rome without the bonkers element. Is that I good thing or not? I thought it would be but I'm not so sure.

Engine building games aren't really my thing, though the fact that this plays in 30 minutes or so is a big plus.

It felt... very souless. All just churning cards and paying so little attention to each other that monopoly bonuses kept being missed.

I'm sure it's interesting in premise, the fact that all of the cards seemed to be almost overpowered is a curious thing, but the game entirely lacked any spark for me.

I'd play again but only to see if my opinion changes now I almost know what I'm doing.

very similar to glory to rome, but maybe a little more streamlined.  i don't like having the buildings on separate cards, but it might actually create a little balance since everyone has access to the same buildings.  it is a race to a certain point total, which adds a little more tension.  there is more of a 'screw you' factor in stealing monopolies from other players (one of two ways to get points).
i like glory to rome better, but if you don't have access to it, this is a decent alternative.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Harmless enough, but really very flat. Very little happens, the buildings don't do much and the game sort of puddles along until someone has a number of points and then it's over. Ho-hum. 

The card colours are also horrifically similar. I don't know what the graphic designer was thinking.

I bought this waiting for Glory to Rome to be reprinted.

Not a bad game, despite the terrible terminology. I think GtR is probably the better game, but this does try some different things.

My plays are all 2p. I am thinking 3+ would be ideal for the game, since one of the roles feels weak in 2p.

Probably won't get touched again now that Mottainai is available, and uses fewer components.

I was never that fond of Glory To Rome, finding both San Juan and Race for the Galaxy more enjoyable implementations of the same idea.  Uchronia is much better competition to those two great games - the rough edges of GtR are gone, and the art is nicer.

I think this is actually a far superior version of Glory to Rome. Not only is it prettier, but it removes the storage action, (or whatever it was called in GtR. The action that lets you store a resource for victory points) In GtR the storage action felt like the best option every time. It was extremely effecient, extremely rewarding, and conveniently cut out 70% of the roles.

Without that action you are forced to use all the roles and look for interesting building combos.

exciting theme was promised, no theme was found...
very mechanical gameplay, takes some time to get it, unfortunately standard rules just don't work... it's almost guarented that you will hit some locked-down state with available buildings not matching the color of available resources... so basic houserule: separate the buildings by color in 5 stacks; play with the top building of each stack available, so that there is always one building of each color available.

was hoping for Innovation-feel with a dino-theme, very disapointed on both sides!

[+] with my houserule, gameplay is smooth with a strong progression, mechanic offer some good tactical choices and even strategies (with basic rules, no strategy possible)
[-] no theme! game can end suddenly (even with one more round) with monopole shift; keeping track of score and number of monopoles is a pain (always have to re-count), same thing regarding the increasing number of triggers to check...

1e essai à 5 joueurs. Essayé immédiatement après notre 1e partie-découverte de « La gloire de Rome » (du même auteur), nous n’avons même pas terminé la partie (abandon d’un commun accord). Selon l’auteur, Uchronia se veut une version "retravaillée" (en moins chaotique) de GdR et en cela, Uchronia est effectivement plus ordonné et me semble un peu plus abordable que GdR, mais ni un ni l'autre ne sont des jeux à mettre entre toutes les mains. Finalement, il serait trop long d’expliquer tout ce qui m’a déplût mais en résumé, je trouve qu'Uchronia fait malheureusement figure d'un GdR ayant perdu toute sa saveur.

Better than Glory To Rome. Less chaos, more planning, balanced buildings, more streamlined. And not that easier than GtR. Depth and flavour remains the same, so don't expect family game here. Euro-ish version of GtR. Strange components' quality is absolutely bearable. I was thinking about laminating cards, now I'm not.

Sent to a better place, a big fan of Chudyk. I realised I never wanted to teach this so hopefully it'll get played in its new home. After playing Mottainai and Red7, I'm keen to see the newer evolutions of his designs. Uchronia strikes me as a bit old-school for him, and I really think he's improving with each new design.

from the one game I have played I enjoyed it.  I like that the card has multiple uses, and can be used different ways.  I also like that if you don't have the card you need you can use 2 of the same cards to perform the action you want to do.  I like this because it keeps the game from bogging down and allows you more options on your turn.  I want to play the game some more!

Ancient city building card game that reimplements Glory to Rome to construct buildings. Multi-use cards can be played as an action, used as a building resource or tucked under player boards to increase mastery of a discipline (e.g. production or building) where the leader gains a monopoly bonus. I love the recycling aspect of the forum for spent action cards to be used as building foundations and its interplay with other actions. The game comes alive as buildings are completed and their special abilities start playing off each other, building synergy and combos. I wasn't expecting to like this but find it addicting and fun building the engine and the race to complete buildings while managing majority of the monopoly bonuses.

Really great alternative to Glory to Rome.  In some ways I prefer it to Glory to Rome.  I like that players vie over a pool of buildings.

My one complaint is the same one you hear all the time--component quality really needed to be better.  Just full size cards would have been great.  What were you thinking, Iello?

Edit: 2nd play of this was really, really flat.  I might play it one more time before shipping it out.

Sure, it's a simple Glory to Rome, but that doesn't mean that Uchronia isn't fun. I quite enjoyed it. Oh sure, I hate the hobbit-sized cards, and that the resource icons are all bricks in various colors. I also disliked the square cards with square corners, and the lack of symbols on those cards to identify which resource they go with, as the game features colors which are just too close to each other.

Still, I had a blast playing the game, and would easily play it again. However, only if Glory to Rome wasn't around at said time.

Glory to Rome light.  Easier to teach, but not as much fun.  The buildings were boring.  The colors of the building were hard to distinguish if you are colorblind.  I miss being able to follow.  Given the choice, I would always choose Glory to Rome, but the artwork may make some people more willing to try Uchronia.

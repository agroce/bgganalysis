Very similar to Love Letter, but it only plays with 2 players and essentially is a Rock-Paper-Scissors style game. It does what it sets out to do - provides a laugh for 2 minutes, while waiting to play a real game. It's so short and luck-driven, you can't take it seriously, but I can't deny that it is fun.

1st play: More fun than a game this size has a right to be. The game is all meta, and the art is pleasing to look at. Turns are fast, but unfortunately it only plays 2. Still a fun game though. 

No 2nd play: the game is simple and fun but I never find myself seeking out fillers so they pretty much top out at 7. Still I enjoyed this one

I actually own "R" which is the original Braverats game, and I totally love it! I played this for the first time for money, like a gambling game, at a party and it was very cool! Though the drawings on the Braverats cards are super cute, I still prefer the more serious artwork in "R".

2 player bluffing game. This is quite silly, but fun. Each player picks one character from 2 identical sets of 9 and flips them over. Highest total wins round. There are lots of exceptions and special rules that can change that however. These kind of quick double guessing games are right up my alley.

Very fun little game. Can easily play 5 games in 30 minutes or less. I've suggested it several times and wouldn't turn down a game of it because it goes so fast. Also makes a great time-kill game while waiting for people to show up for a heavier game on game night.

One neat aspect occurs when you can play say 5-10 or more games back to back. Eventually you start playing against your opponent's expectations of what you expect them to play. The layers of meta get very deep very quickly.

Juego de cartas tremendamente sencillo, que se explica en un minuto y una partida dura menos de cinco minutos. Son dos sets de 7 cartas (los conjuntos son iguales para cada jugador), y en cada turno cada jugador juega una carta. Gana la carta más alta, y además, las cartas tienen acciones que se ejecutan. Está bien. Se puede hacer uno una versión casera sin mucho esfuerzo.

Cute little 2-player game, but this is no Love Letter. The primary aspect of this game seems to lie in bluffing and guessing what the other player is going to play, whereas Love Letter has more deductive aspects of what players still have in their hands. Still a nice little game, though, even if choices are obvious (We've literally had hands where both of us played exactly the same cards).

RATING: N/A
This game is split about evenly between getting into your opponent's head and playing the odds, though those odds sometimes include considerations for future rounds as well as the likelihood of winning the current one.

If I had to summarize the feel (based on one play at 2 AM, mind you), it might be "Cat-and-mouse, but both players are both cat and mouse", which isn't bad for a game of 14 cards and a rulebook. And it's lightning-quick. Would cheerfully try again.

Ahora mismo, mi microjuego favorito para 2 jugadores. Muy rápido, sencillo y con un pique terrible XD A diferencia del Love Letter, en este juego si que tienes que tomar decisiones, y aunque la suerte está muy presente, el decidir si te arriesgas o no es lo que termina decantando la partida. Muy recomendado!

It's great for what it is -- and it's honest about that fact.  It's extremely short and only has 16 cards, but it's sophisticated simplicity and pretty art style.  Need to settle a quick decision; this is a fun and far-better than a coin-toss or a die-roll.  Got a few minutes to kill while waiting; this is a fun way to kill that time.  I appreciate that it comes with a huge number of variants already in the rule book and the design lends itself to many more.

[thing=112373][/thing]is a wonder.  A 2 player microgame par excellance.  It is a seemingly ridiculously simple game, where you each have cards numbered 1-8 and the one who plays the highest card is the winner.  But it is transformed into something on a much higher level by giving each card a special ability.  Like "lowest card wins", or "this round is a draw" or "next round you add two to your card" and so on.  First to win 4 'tricks' is the winner.  It plays quite literally in 3 minutes and it is a game which begs the question "why has no one ever thought of this before?".   Stripped down gaming excellence.

It's Love Letter light made just for two. Don't let my mediocre rating fool you. Brave Rats is a fun diversion and it even has a few challenging decisions to make.

R is, in short, Love Letter for two. It takes the make-or-break structure of the multi-player game to make it into something more-than-workable for two. Simultaneously picking special-effect cards (with some having effects that carry over) from a dwindling group means that options continue dropping, and the stakes continue rising. It creates so much from so little and puts players in a direct relationship with one another: the cards are a but a pliable (and beautifully arted, with its wood-block print aesthetic) medium through which rivals butt heads.

Great filler for 2 people. Can be taken almost anywhere but doesn't have that much replay value. It seems that most of the time we ended up playing the same card. However, it's a lot of fun to try and guess what your opponent will play and counter it. Really fast game easy to learn.

With the new "rats" theme or whatnot.
This game is not AS timeless as love letter. But it's close. The pictures and character abilities ooze theme. It's over so fast that you can play 3 games in 5 minutes if no one has analysis paralysis.
For 10 bucks, do yourself a favor and pick it up.

Very good little bluff game that takes 5 minutes or less to play, and about 1 minute to learn. Decisions are tricky since it revolves around double-think, it feels a little like a Love Letter game for two people (note I have not played LL with two, but I imagine this is similar in feel) or a boiled down Citadels for two.  

Have not tried any of the MANY variants as game works good, but might soon since it doesn’t have that much for legs.  It’s a VERY quick filler, and only meant to be played that way and not 7 times in a row or once a week which will wear it out quicker as there isn’t much to explore. At any rate variants look interesting and its nice to have them there for other options to help keep it fresh.

I like R as a very quick 2-player filler that has some nice strategy. I also love how this game is Love Letter for two players. I don't really like Love Letter with only 2 players, but R takes the idea of Love Letter and perfects it for 2 players.

Quick and fun.

Super simple bluffing and deduction game that feels like a 2 player version of Love Letter (or perhaps Love Letter is multiplayer R, given R was first in print).

Takes about 4 minutes for a game, so 'best of three' feels like the right way to go.

This is a great, quick, role selection game. Sprt of a cross between Love Letter and Libertalia for two players. Really glad I picked this one up. The theme is really cute, too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Each player has eight cards, each with their own power, to try and win four rounds of "War"-like combat (highest card wins unless power says otherwise). It's definitely a quick game for two players, but has the same level of enjoyment as "War" (meaning that you reach a point you're done with it now).

PLUS: enjoyable, very quick
MINUS: cost, never pulls you in beyond a few plays

As a microgame with a bluffing element it's okay. We still use it as a fun "tiebreaker" for other games or decisions.
On its own this game got old very quickly due to lack of depth and variety.

RATING: 5
Light five minute bluffing game that is referred to by some as [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129622/love-letter]love letters[/url] for two. This is a very short, light and portable card game consisting of just sixteen cards. But also one that gets boring and the same thing over and over again after a couple of plays. So I guess there is a difference: it doesn't have the same longevity as love letters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun filler with a bit of thought thrown it. Not a lot of depth, so it Will get old if played more that a few times in a row, but is "ok" to bring out every few months for a quick 5 min game.

About as deep as a puddle, but plays fantastically fast, and provides some great moments of trying to outthink your opponents if you can predict which card they're about to play. Terrific art, and a fun way to fill a few minutes while waiting for others at a game night, or restaurant, etc. Shame about the tin, as this would otherwise be amazingly portable.

Great microgame, never gets old because reading the opponent plays a big part. The Rats-re-theme does nothing for me, though, and the offered "variants" I find worse than useless (they spoil a good game). (Btw, I don't get those frequent comparisons to "Love Letter". The only things these completely different games have in common are the number of cards and the designer.)

This wasn't too bad. The game is basically a 2-player version of Love Letter, and it feels like the cards of Love Letter were meshed with the game, War. It's a neat little game, but there's almost no game space within the rules. Games of this can be as short as a minute, and sometimes everything is going to hinge on a single card play. There's a lot of double-think going on, so fans of LOTR Confrontation and games like that will probably appreciate this one. If I want to play a 2p micro game, however, I'm probably going to stick with Cypher.

[i]Overall very uninspiring 2p variant of Love Letter; not a game I need to play again. I enjoyed my first play, but after playing it again it just fell flat. I am starting to realize that I really don't care for micro games that play in a few minutes and I'm not interested in playing multiple rounds of this game. Instead I would rather play a quick dice filler like [thing=117942][/thing], [thing=111148][/thing] or stick with [thing=129622][/thing].[/i]

With Love Letter, Chronicle and now this, I'm ready to call Seiji Kanai one of my favourite designers. It's another 16-carder, this one for two players each with an identical deck running from 0-7. You play cards simultaneously, highest card wins, and first to four wins the game. That doesn't sound like much, but each card also has a special power -- a running theme for Kanai -- which turns it into a delightul dance of double-think. Like Love Letter, it belongs in a new (?) genre of 'micro-filler'. It's over in five minutes and the rules even suggest using it as a way to decide start player for a longer game.

RATING: 7.08
Interesting game.  It's a 2P micro-game similar to Love Letter (same designer), but you each have your own set of 8 cards.  You decide which one card to play for each battle (each has a rank 0 to 7, as well as a special power).  When you win 4 battles, you win that game.

You can think of it as similar to war, with 3 MAJOR improvements.  1) you can look at your cards and decide which one to play.  2) each card has a special ability which adds an element of strategy to the game, and 3) it's shorter.....you don't play until you win all the cards, it's a race to 4 victories

The game is extremely quick and fun.

The first time my daughter and I played the game, we put down matching cards 8 times in a row!  I have never seen that happen since.  Great minds and all that....

The rule book also suggests several variants.  We enjoyed the 'hand of 3 cards' variant, which adds some luck to the game.

Our favorite variant was one player takes both princes (highest card), the other player take both princesses (the lowest card).  If you play the play the princess against the prince you win the game...not just the battle, the entire game.

RATING: 7
My wife added this game to an online order we did in around May 2015, because it was going cheap - I had never heard of the game but, on the evidence of 4 or 5 games so far, I am glad she did. It is yet another Japanese game - from the same designer as Love Letter and Lost Legacy - with again just 16 cards. But this one is rather different, being a 2p-only game and with no luck of the draw, each player has their full 8-card "deck" to play from, and the game is about trying to read (or "guess") what your opponent might do in order to win "battles". I find it really rather interesting, and am surprised it has such a low rating on BGG. I can perhaps imagine it being solvable, in a probabilistic sense, with certain plays being clearly better, but so far I really enjoy, in the last couple of battles, working through what options I have, what counters my opponent might then be able to play, and where that would leave me for the following battle if they played them. And the rulebook seems to give plenty of variants to mix things up if it does become boring.

So this looks to me, at this stage, like a very nice little game with even a little bit of meat despite the lack of components and very short play-time. It's still light though, probably too much so for me to ever rate it above a 7 - especially since I'm not in a rush to play it all the time. But it's a very nice little game.

Very short small fun filler game of simultaneously deciding which card to play until someone has won 4 card pairs, thus it's a game of psychology + luck + calculation. It gets an admirably clever high amount of mileage from 2 identical decks of only 8 cards!

26-01-2015. Rated after several plays. R is a very simple game, a two person version of love letter. I think I like Love Letter better but R is quite interesting. The game is several rounds long of cards that win in certain situations. You try to figure out what your opponent is going to play and play a card that allows you to win over them.

It's interesting, I liked it. But I am not sure if it's going to be a long time favorite. It's mostly just a fun diversion that is fun for a while but nothing special.

RATING: 7
Very quick card game for two players. Typically lasts no more than five minutes. Each player has an identical hand of cards and there's no shuffling or drawing from a deck, so there's absolutely no element of chance. In that respect it has almost a chess-like feel - it's all about trying to predict your opponent's choice of cards and pre-emptively counter it. Again, it's extremely quick but certainly a fun (and pocket sized) way to pass some time if space and/or  time are limited. 

As an aside, the rules mention several variants, some of which can accommodate more players, but they're almost all just other games using the same cards - things like the old 'match two face-down cards from the grid' tedium. Ignore these 'variants'. They're weak. Good game otherwise, though.

Love Letter perfected for two players. Actually I prefer this to Love Letter. You've got a small hand of cards with values and special actions. The winner is the first to four points. Each simultaneously revealed card can win a point (or two). As cards are played your hand is depleted and the game becomes less guessing and more educated guessing as you can see what your opponent has played and what they're still holding. It's over fast and leaves you wanting to play again. Perfect while waiting for a plane, or waiting for a plane to take off. Good stuff.

A really clever little ultra-quick game.  When you first open the tin and see that there are only a handful of cards, that they are identical for each side, and that the basic mechanism looks like the old children's card game War, you don't expect much.

And then you play it.

And play it again immediately after finishing.

And repeat.

It's easy for this to snowball and you can quickly end up in a situation where any card you play will result in you losing the point.

But, the whole game takes 2 minutes, so that's barely of note.

Another cute design that makes for some interesting, semi agonising, decisions.

Update: Oh, wait. This is great. Played over a series of hands, it become a mini chess match of working out what people's tendencies are and playing accordingly, but even over one hand, this is an amazing little bit of great design.

From the designer of [thing=129622][/thing], this is another card game with minimal components that plays quickly.  Both players have identical decks and choose cards simultaneously.  It's basically a trick taking game where the higher number wins the trick, but of course there are various effects on each card.  And if nobody wins the trick, it caries over and the next trick is worth two (or three, or four...).  I'm pretty "meh" about [thing=129622][/thing], but this is a clear step up, at least for 2 players.

A completely lack of randomness means this card game comes entirely down to strategy and reading your opponent. Every play has a counter if you can correctly anticipate what will happen, but skillful play can set up opportunities where you can't be beat.

With so few cards, I wonder if the game will become stale, but it may be able to keep my interest. The first plays were really, really good.

RATING: 8
This game is just what I was hoping it would be. A very simple, light two-player game that still has room for some clever plays. For example, you might play your "my next card has +2 strength" card, but that leaves your opponent free to play their "lowest strength wins the round" card, so what do you do?
Or you might be one point away from winning the round so you could play your Prince card for a guaranteed win... but if your opponent plays their Princess card, they'll win the whole game instead.

My only concern is that it could become too same-y after a while, but the variants in the rulebook should be enough to extend the life of the game for some time.

Copy of R English edition. Really nothing much to see here except to play a guessing game with your opponent and to gauge the next card your opponent will play. This guessing gets better as the game progresses as you can see what cards are available in your opponent's hand. I find the limited card hand variant to be slightly more tensioned filled since you don't always know if you opponent as a certain card in hand. Game is also better if you know all the card powers ahead of time.

It is not a strategic game nor is it a cerebral game. But then again, what do you expect in 5 minutes?

I like games where you're trying to out-think your opponents, so this game appealed to me right off the bat.  The game is straightforward: Each player plays a card at the same time, and the higher power wins, unless the special action of the card changes how to determine the winner.  There are a lot of cards that can cancel each other out, so it's never clear which card to play on a given turn.  The first turn or two might be very random, as it takes a couple of cards to get a feel for how the game will progress, and there will come points in the game where you know which cards to play based on what the other player will play, but you have to take a gamble on which to play.  I don't mind it (that's the source of the tension I like in the game), but it won't be for everyone.  On the plus side, it only plays in five minutes.

You can clearly see how R was a step in the evolution towards Love Letter. It's a fun game, but as a complete "I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me" game, it ultimately comes down to a whole lot of luck. It's not completely without an element of skill, definitely not, but at the start of each game you basically just have to count on luck. Sure, if you know you're opponent you can try to out think them, but then you're back to the "I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you" dilemma.

I enjoy it, and play it sporadically, and usually many times in a row. It's a game I will suggest from time to time, given it's quick and addictive nature, and it works great as a means to determine the start player in other two player games.

After creating a couple of Dutch editions of Love Letter, we had some blank playing cards left. We wanted to do something with them, instead of hiding them in a drawer, were they probably would have to stay unused forever. While surfing on BGG, I bumped into another cardgame designed by Senji Kanai (the designer of Love Letter), which also used a very small amount of cards. Read the rules, and we decided to make a copy of it for ourselves. As all the necessary images were on BGG (we needed 10 different images to create 16 cards), the only thing there was left to do, is to translate the cards into Dutch. Within, about an hour, of looking at the game for the first time, everything was ready for printing, sticking and cutting. Played 5 games in a row, it took about 15 minutes. Not as much fun, as Love Letter is, but a nice game to play, if the available room is very small.

Two player simple simultaneous action selection game. There are numerous variants in the rule book. I'll try it out sometime.

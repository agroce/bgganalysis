It's been a few years since I played the full-sized version, but I remember it being much harder than this one. Maybe I've just gotten faster, more coordinated and luckier?? It seemed just like Gnip-Gnop to me. Mixed with a sling-shot and played in a box-hockey box.

[3 plays] Remember Gnip Gnop?  This is essentially the exact same thing with a different dexterity action (and one calling for a bit more dexterity).  It's a fun little game, and although game length is theoretically quite indeterminate, in practice it's usually about 5 minutes.  So a good game to have sitting around for when you're waiting to do something else.

NHL Fastrack
MFG: Blue Orange Games
#of Players: 2
Age Range: 
Overall Construction: Fastrack is a mostly wooden game. It is constructed very well. There is a little cloth net bag that is used to hold the hockey pucks. Be careful when opening the bag because if you don’t the clamping device that holds the bag shut it can slip off the end of the string and you will have to find a way to slide it back on. There are 2 elastic bands, one on either side. They are good, but like any elastic, I see it degrading over time. The pucks are cool. They are wooden disks, but have the shape and markings of actual hockey pucks.
Gameplay: Simple enough, take it out of the box, place it on the table, & divide the pucks in half (should be 5 pucks each). Place the pucks on the side of the board. Each player simultaneously takes the pucks on their side of the board, one at a time, and try to shoot the pucks through the hole in the center. It is possible to shoot it over the wall, but not advisable because if you accidentally shoot it off the table, you have to hold back that puck in reserve until all pucks have been removed from your side of the board. At that point you can try to get rid of it. First one to empty their side of the board of pucks wins the game.
For real-ish NHL style action flip the table after someone wins and play 3 rounds, for a best 2 out of 3 rounds. 
Yes/No Recommend: This can be a quick easy game to play and although I suggest not shooting the pucks over the wall, it can be great fun. At first I had concerns about the bands & what I would do if they would break. Thankfully when I contacted Blue Orange I found out that they sell replacement bands. 
You will notice that the pucks start to leave black streaks of the surface of the board. You can clean them up with isopropyl alcohol and a cotton swab. I’m not sure about other methods. I worry about the isopropyl because it appears to remove some of the lines as well. I will continue to test other methods of cleaning them. A suggestion I made to Blue Orange was to sell a Zamboni shaped eraser to help clear up the black streaks. They seemed to like the idea so we will see. In the meantime, if you don’t want black streaks on your board you can always try the original version of Fastrack.
Where To Get It: This game has been around for a little bit so most game stores should have it. I have not seen this game at any big box store. For more information on this game and other Blue Orange Games please visit their website at http://www.blueorangegames.com/index.php/games/nhl-fastrack

Bought on a whim after seeing the original large-scale version at Origins last year. It's silly fun but gets old pretty quickly, so overall a disappointment. Also the rubber bands sometimes jump up over a disc when pulling back to flick, which is a (minor) annoyance.

I have a weakness for dexterity games and this is clearly the smallest version of one of my favorites, le Passe Trappe.  

It's small but surprisingly it works great. I thought it would be too tiny and light to work correctly but thankfully I was wrong. Occasionally a piece may launch off the board but we just pause and continue once we retrieve it. 

It's fun, it's cheap and I recommend this, especially if you can't go all in on buying le Passe Trappe.

I don't really mind kid's games, but this is a dexterity game. I like a few dexterity games, like the PitchCar-type games and Crokinole. But this wasn't enough like them to make turn the tide. Plus it's a speed game. Which, now that I think about it, is the thing I should've focused on originally. I don't like speed games.

A simple but enjoyable dexterity game. Also known as Pucket or Le Presse Trappe. This is the cheaper version and shows it in build quality, however for the price you can't really complain.

This two player game has players trying to flick wooden disks through a small gate into the opponents side using elastic stretched across your end of the wooden arena. The first person to get all 10 disks on the other side wins!

1 play

Super quick skill game: The game board is a walled rectangle divided in 2 by a wall with a puck-sized notch in the center. Each player has an equal number of pucks on their side of the wall, and an elastic band. Play simultaneously, racing to fling all the pucks over to the other side. It should be over in less than 5 minutes!

I knock the micro version down half a point because the little guys sometimes fling completely out of the game, and you have to stop playing to return it to the play area!

RATING: 4
This isn't a game, it's an activity and not one I'm terribly fond of.  The "game" is just a board with two sides divided by a barrier with a small slit in the middle.  On each side of the board is an elastic band and a number of small wooden disks.  The goal is to use this band to flick the discs from your side of the board through the small slit to the opponent's.  When all the disks are on one player's side of the board, that player loses.

It's mindless and really just comes down to whoever has played this more or is simply better at dexterity games.  In fact I can see this game dragging on infinitely with two evenly matched players...

This one is so fast and so easy that it can't help but make it to the table under just the right circumstances. And whenever it does it will get about 10 plays. It will probably have the incredible distinction of being one of my lowest rated games but also my most played.

Strange.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 3
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 3.75

RATING: 4
Le Passe-trappe is a strange dexterity game where the winner is the first person to get all of the disks to the opponent’s side of the board. The trick is that there is only a small gap in the middle of the board through which the disks can pass. The second trick is that you have to bounce the disks off of a taut string at the back of your end of the board, rather than sliding them directly towards the other side. These two things combined make the game rather difficult for beginners, or at least for me, especially when you’re playing against Dan Karp, who later reveals that he owns the game!

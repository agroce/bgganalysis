An incredible, meaty, brain burner of a tile layer. After struggling through with incorrect rules, we played it a couple times correctly and it was incredible. The ability to pick up your caballeros before you play a tile leads to many situations where you may not be safe when you thought you were. The advanced rules don't add much to the rule set but greatly change the game in a good way. I can't imagine not being down to play this game whenever

RATING: 7
Imagine El Grande without a board.  El Caballero takes us to a new world, where the areas we will try to control are gradually discovered through tile placements.  Instead of cubes or meeples, El Caballero has double-sided tiles with a number on each side.  Place one next to a land or sea area and the number shows how many of your guys are there.  Beyond exerting control, these tiles are useful for blocking the further growth of a land or sea area.  However, they are also vulnerable; a second land tile placed next to one and it is removed.

Important things to understand are why you would want to remove a Caballero tile (to allow further growth of a land or sea which your opponents had not bargained for), and the great value of the 9 power cards, which allow two land tile placements in a turn.

A bit of a brain burner that usually resolves into a tight, tense contest. There's certainly potential for analysis paralysis as Kramer and Ulrich offer plenty of possible actions that can be done in any order.  And then, of course, there is what your opponents might do to consider. In view of this and because it is turn-based, it is probably best played with no more than three.

Production and artwork are both decent, though it really did not need the big box that the few pieces would rattle around in, where it not for a giant insert.

Get your thinking caps on! This is definitely NO light game, but a German style game with forethought as the main prerequisite. There is an abstract nature to the game that gives it tremendous depth, but thematically and historically it misses the mark. Nevertheless the components are nice and the replay value is quite high once you get a handle on the strategy.

RATING: 6.5
Played with 4,  and I agree with the comments that suggest this is too many.  (Too much downtime.)  The game itself is good,  but I haven't played it enough to see much of the strategy.  The problem I have at the moment is how to reign in someone with a good area.  I got nuked twice trying,  (I admit to inexperience in caballero placement,  this was my first game),  but even with experience, I could see this becoming an expensive war between 2 players,  while the other player mopped up points elsewhere.

I suspect that Carcassonne would not be as good as it is, had Bernd Brunhoffer (HiG) not cut his teeth on this first.  This game is much too negative to be fun, or for me to want to play again.  Seems to be all about stuffing your opponents and there is little you can do about it.  Similar cards to El Grande allowed it to trade on that great game's brand.  A disappointment.  (Sold Apr-06)

RATING: 9
A game that deserves to be much better known than it is.  Shares little in common with El Grande apart from the card mechanism for "reinforcements" and order of play.

The theme is even more "pasted on" (discovering and colonising the Americas) but the game play is even deeper and the game is a real brain burner.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Before playing the game, I wanted wooden pieces for the Caballeros...but after reading the rules and playing the game, I found that I highly enjoy rotating and flipping the Caballero cards.  Playing with the Governors and Grandes is a must. 

Anyway, El Caballero is definitely a gamer's game for the rotating of the Caballero cards would probably seem especially strange to non-gamers.  I read about the ship strategy on BBG and found it very powerful.  

The main downside to El Caballero is that it's perhaps too clever and unique for its own good.  Although the gameplay is both challenging and innovative, it also can be described as being unintuitive and brainburning.

First Play: Admittedly I got a rule badly wrong that wrote off one turn and we all seemed to miss that you can play 2 Cabeleros card on your turn. As a result its a classic example of allowing the first game to pass off as a learning experience.

However, there doesn't seem to be much meat in this sandwich. Yes there is room for strategy and positioning but somehow it left me a little cold and feeling that it was a dumbed down version of El Grande.

Played 1.5 times.
First time was 2-p...late at night, burned out after a full day of gaming. I was explaining the rules to someone else who also hadn't played before. It went very badly, and we agreed to stop half-way through. I was saying, "I gotta trade this sucker - this is just incomprehensible".

Well, the next day, two other friends wanted to play. I said   ok. Damn - it was sooooo much better after I had had some time to think more about the rules and what to do. Even though the other 2 were first timers, it all started clicking after the first scoring round, and some nasty moves started to appear soon after. Lots of fun, but still far from the most intuitive game I've ever played. It'll need one more game to give a rating, but my thoughts of trading are gone now!

Wow. This was much heavier than I'd expected. So much to watch out for. I won my first game, but I don't feel like I should have. I made some obvious mistakes and definitely missed some stuff. I don't have a handle on this one yet. I can't wait to play it again. I expect my rating to go up after more plays.

UPDATE:
I've definitely gotten the hang of this game, though I still sometimes miss something that someone else sees. I really like the game. It's different every time: Sometimes there's a huge water area that everyone's trying to get a piece of, and sometimes there's one big huge land area. Always different. There's a lot to think about, and it's very intense--especially the last three rounds, leading up to final scoring.

However, I never want to play this game within a few weeks after having played it--and even that would be a bit too soon. Even with three players who know the game well and are usually very fast in other games, this game takes three hours. There's just so much to think about and consider--especially in the later rounds--that the turns take a long time. You can think about your turn ahead of time, but chances are that the tile you wanted or the spot in which you were going to place tiles is gone by the time it's your turn, so you need to reevaluate everything. There's a lot at stake, and you can have what seems like an unlimited number of choices, so it can take a while to figure out what the best move is.

RATING: 5
One of the heavier German games I have played.  With a rules complexity on par with Tigris and Euphrates, it manages even more depth of play.  This is not a newb-friendly game.  Unfortunately, a tendency exists to degrade into analysis paralysis and excessive downtime.  Furthermore, the nature of the game results in more players (with an accompanying 10 more turns) increasing game length tremendously.

Update:  Further playings have not been kind to El Caballero.  What is at first glance a game with a great breadth of options in a turn, is in fact much less.  Don't believe the hype, this a bone-dry game, with little tension and torpid mechanisms.  Get El Grande and forget about its rightfully neglected sister.

Dry, dry, dry. Sadly, this was the game that convinced my husband that he didn't like Wolfgang Kramer as a designer (which has serious ramifications for several other games in our collection). It is basically an abstract tile-laying puzzle, but unlike Carcassonne, it is mean: you can spend several turns building something up only to have it taken away from you right before scoring.

The biggest problem I have with the game is the turn-order mechanic. Whoever goes last in the previous turn gets to choose their card first in the next turn. This has a distinct disadvantage, because when you choose your card, the other players can decide whether to play higher or lower than you, thus basically deciding turn order for themselves. This can set up a cycle: the last player gets stuck being last player again in the next turn. Generally you want to go first to be able to choose tiles, unless it's a scoring round, in which case you want to go last, so you can oust your opponent from an advantageous spot: this is easy to accomplish for players who have been going first each turn, because they will still have most of their low cards. It's a bad system, particularly bad in a two-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While it was never a favorite style of mine, I'm finding I have even less patience for this kind of perfect information, turn maximization type of game anymore.  The game play is so stoic as everyone spends their turns trying to min/max their positions and compute the permutations of what their opponents could and might do.  It ends up feeling staid and uninteresting.  Games this dry really only work for me if they are two-player games because then they are faster paced and you can take some pride in victory because there's no 3rd or 4th person involved to throw the game to someone.

On the one hand, I do kinda sympathise with the feeling on this one that it's just too heavy; but I like it a lot. It manages to be a tough, challenging game, but yet to have just enough trappings of your average "fun" eurogame to make it engaging. You get to watch the continents grow, your choices are just constrained enough that you have lots of options but not so many your head explodes. This is probably one of the few "card-game" style spinoffs of bigger boardgames in which the nominally smaller game is more intense than the big-box game! El Grande is still the better game because it's a lot more accessible and intuitive, more varied and replayable, and flows more cleanly. But I like El Caballero a lot.

Played a single game of three players and thought i almost managed to win. The basic game was decently simple but offered a huge variety of choices each turn, often leading to seemingly long turns and lots of downtime, but the game was over in an hour and was very strategically and tactically satisfying. I was told it was based on El Grande and that made the game instantly make so much more sense for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating after just one play, with the expanded rules.

I very much enjoyed playing this. I like the cut-throat nature of the map-piece positioning. It has that similar blend of obviously tactical play with nonobvious long-term strategy that El Grande has. The supply/court interplay with the same kind of action cards as El Grande is one of my favorite game mechanics. 

The only thing keeping this one from rating higher right off the bat for me is the slowly grinding turns. I don't generally mind games that some people label as "analysis paralytics" and this one is certainly in that group. Also, as the map gets more complex...the turns get slower and slower. 

I THINK the gameplay would speed up with more familiarity. In the game I played we were 4 new players. If we could trim our play time by 1/3 I think this would be an 8 or so for me. 

Initially I didn't think there was much relationship to El Grande besides the art on the box and the graphic design. The action cards are straight from El Grande. But as I played more, I began to realize it IS about area control....married to tile-laying. Its really a beautifully integrated mechanic. I don't think El Caballero gets as much credit as it ought to....but there is no doubt that its a brain-burner, cut-throat and tricky. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Overlooked semi-oldie by Kramer and Ulrich that is the much more gamey precursor to the Carc series. Basically take the El Grande card auction and guy angst, and then team that up with a Carc style tile collection which is, instead of being a blind draw ala Carc, drafted from a pool. Somewhat brain burney because of all the possiblities for each tile, but not as overwhelming as I'd been led to believe. 

The thing that makes this game difficult (but also fun for me) is the interesting timing decisions, indeed, I would say learning how to time moves is probably the thing that makes playing this game well so difficult. When you do something can be just as important, if not more imporant than what you do. Removing and placing caballero cards, placing governors, placing ships, using your tile(s), using the grande...all of them offer little decisions which can add up in the long run.

I highly recommend playing with the Governors and Grandes though, both add a lot of interesting tactics to the game. Overall a fun design with enough things going on to be interesting...a gamers only title though, and a little on the dry side.

Cerebral. Carcasonne squared. Too bad I always got the tile laying rules wrong, which is why I had to create a player guide explaining them in the clearest possible language. Next time I play the game (the fifth or sixth), it will be according to the correct rules. I'm deeply embarrased by this. (I've created a little reminder [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/258145/overlooked-rules]here[/url].)

So, after a few genuine attempts I am able to assess this game in a better fashion. I regret to say that things did not work out quite as well as I had hoped they would. Despite offering a lot of flexibility with the near-free action choices and thus a lot of opportunity to string these together kicking out opponents from unassailed positions, I am of the opinion that the game is too rule-heavy, with some annoying gamey details. There are differences in what happens to ships in the event of withdrawal of a caballero card, and you must pay attention as to how withdrawn caballeros end up in your court. For a game which in essence is tile laying with simple shapes of terrain and a majority mechanism, things devolve quickly into a slow, plodding, and computationally rich progression where the charming subject ('the disccovery of Las Americas', at least in the Dutch edition) is pushed far to the background. What also doesn't help matters much is the rather bland design. Of course we're talking a game over a decade old, but still, the cardboard is thin, the colours are somewhat washed-out, and following the contours of a large plot of land can be tricky. 

All in all my interest in this game has begun to decline. If I want to play a majority game, I want it to be appealing, and regrettably most games I know featuring this mechanic [i]are[/i] more appealing. Even the unclear Bison: you really don't need free action choice in order to create tough choices for the players. My current verdict: I'll join in a game upon request, but I'll be hesitant about suggesting it myself.

Components: Attractive area tiles. I find the rotating caballero tiles very cumbersome.

Experience: There are a lot of choices during my turn, but often none of them are very attractive. Typically the most powerful thing to do is to place an area tile, but that is very constrained by the luck of the draw. It is very difficult to protect in-play caballero cards from the double-land elimination rule. Interesting, but feels like work.

Hosszú idő után elővéve újra. Alapverzióval játszottunk csak -fáradtság-, de a vélemény továbbra is: könnyedebb játék, ahol jól gyúrták egybe az El Grande és a Carca tulajdonságait, kellő mennyiségű kitolási lehetőség, sőt akár véressé is tehető, jól szervezhető, taktikázós. Kellemes 1 órás, a rövid verzió. A hosszabban több kombináció.

El Caballero is a very good mix of Carcassonne and El Grande.

I recently replayed this game. I find it very good and enjoyed it even more than my first game since I knew what I was doing a whole lot better. Matter of fact I won the second game.

I am surprised that it wasn't very popular and there is not a reprint coming out. It is a good game nevertheless in my opinion. A real brain burner. El Caballero is better played in the afternoon than in the evening when your tired.

Excellent game. Don't know way this game is not vert popular. Too bad it's out of print. I real gem.

Same game family as El Grande.

Very nice game, now out of print, well worth grabbing. Not too tricky, it can turn into a bit of a spoiler, I'll play this tile not to score for me but to mess up you. ** Played again afer years. Too much downtime and analysis paralysis. The rules and gameplay are very very simple, but the variation of possible moves is hard to compute optimally, and the game can take way too long for 7 simple rounds. And it was to easy to push somebody right out of contention. And the rules set needs re-writing in better English.
*** Played it again after 6 years, and I like it! It certainly works very well as a 2P game. Now I want to play it again. Fickle, moi?

El Caballero is the mean-spirited ancestor of Carcassonne. At its heart it is a similarly simple tile laying and area majority game, but there are significant differences that turn it into a much more vicious and challenging game.

Each turn there are five tiles to choose from. Players bid for turn order and replenish their caballero supply El Grande style. More than one player can lay claim to a single feature and there are ways to evict caballeros again.

Considering how strongly El Caballero apparently inspired the subsequent game of the year it's a bit surprising that it gets so little time in the limelight.

Combines Carcassonne-like tile placement with some El Grande-like area control elements.  First impression is that Carcassonne is highly derivative, but more streamlined... El Cab has some rough edges in the implementation.

Carcassonne's older cousin is among the deepest and most thought-provoking German games of the 1990s.  The rules are quite succinct, but both the mechanics and the strategies can be somewhat counterintuitive.  The way the caballero tiles operate is just plain weird, and there are a lot of little tricks to learn related to moving them on and off the board.  If your first playing of this game leaves you confused, dismayed, and/or drained, don't worry - El Caballero is a game that rewards repeat play.  Plays best with three players.

I used to like this more, but people in my group discovered some killer strategies which take away some of the creativity from the game play and replace it with "do X and try to prevent opponents from doing the same." Still a pretty good game, though. Those who have never tried it before should definitely take any opportunity to give it a spin. Also note that the basic game should be completely ignored--go directly to advanced.

Stemming from 1998, El Caballero is the non-linear love child of Carcassonne (2000) and El Grande (1995). This game revisits (or previsits) some very familiar elements from both game, but with a fair dash of its own dark flair. Yes, this is a game in which you are rewarded for being an ass (a creative ass albeit). From El Grande, we have the sequence bidding cards which allow you to add "dudes" to your "court" as well as area majority scoring; from Carcassonne, we have tile placement and a somewhat familiar scoring structure. However, this is a Kramer game, so the action sequence is plural and non-linear which allows for a lot of space to really muck around with what your opponent(s) are doing (especially since the game allows for the "booting" of opponents off the board with a little planning or ill volition). Overall, the result is a darker, mooodier game that is, in short, a bit more of a brain-burner than its actual (i.e., El Grander) and spiritual (i.e., Carcassonne) lineage.

Interesting game that I would certainly be happy to play again!

Played once with four players.  It worked really well!  Comparisons with Carcassonne are fair, except it actually works with several players!  I find Carcassonne rather tedious with more than two players, but this has mitigated those issues by adding turn order bidding (al la El Grande) and by ramping up the potential for conflict.

I find that the theme is tenuous, and the way that Caballeros are represented by tiles alongside area tiles rather than tokens atop the area tiles does not help matters.  Still, it *is* a tile laying game, so what do you expect?!

An area majority game where the value of the areas being contested emerges over the course of the game. I really see this as a gamers' Carcassonne, it shares many of the same mechanisms, but with much more scope for offensive and defensive play. It's a heavy thinking game, so it can stretch well beyond the advertised 90 minutes with the skill really lying in how you remove your caballero tiles and replace them with area tiles. A bit too dry to reach any all-time favourite lists, but an enjoyable mental workout.

Poor translation makes this much harder to learn than it should be.
Even if it was translated well, I am not convinced it would be good. I found it very unintuitive. The tiles are also pretty ugly. Loses a point because the box is so much bigger than needed.
I am not a fan of Carcassonne but it is far better than this.

Oh boy, this is truly awful awful design..

Not exciting, not deep, you have limited options which decrease (instead of increase) towards the end of the game.  You cannot plan, you feel all the time 'tightness' of everything: rules, possibilities, space - in negative sense i.e. whole the time you feel the game limits you instead of creating possibilities (for pursuing some strategy, for development, for anything).

Try GHEOS if you want similiar mechanics.  Gheos is much, MUCH better and shows a good approach towards this kind of mechanics as represented in El Caballero.

One more thing:  very very rarely mechanics is so loosely connected to the theme as here.  Here, there is even no sane connection between them, even more: mechanics plainly contradicts the theme which makes the latter look absolutely ridiculous.  It would be better to release this title as a pure abstract.  It wouldn't help the mechanics, but it would've been at least less ridiculous.

The Gamer's version of Carc and more...

initial rating 2 games with 2 players basic game 

Carc-a-what? Woahhh now this is the shit! A LITTLE brain burning/AP prone yes so maybe not one to play at the end of the night but an excellent strategic game for 2 or 3 players as a full course, with 4 downtime would be high, AP will get worse and chaos might ensue as well. AP/downtime really wasn't an issue for 2 players and I think 3 will be okay too. Although long term planning isn't really possible you CAN plan here and it is very necessary to winning. I really don't think this is complex at all although it can be slightly tricky to learn, with a turn summary turns are taken quite smoothly/simply but it is not easy or better said that "there are not a lot of simple moves."  

Built around the successful card mechanic of El Grande and it also works very well here, other than this the game feels very very different than EG. I quite like the basic game at least with 2 players and I seen something in the optional rules that I'm not sure I'm keen on but I'll know better soon.  There is a big screwage factor in the game and it is accomplished easiest with playing the one "9" card you have, this allows you to slap down 2 tiles instead of one and opens up some nice possibilities like kicking some of your opponents caballeros off the map so timing this is crucial.  

Our first game was very good but our second game was even better as even more subtitles surfaced such as removing a Cab tile to strategically place a land/water tile to double your points or screw an opponent, this never happened in our first game. 

It is on the dry/abstract side of the spectrum so it won't be for everyone and most likely only really favourable to Gamers.  I quite like it but my rating will stay between 8 - 9 as the 'fun' level isn't quite there to go higher. 

Have not played with optional rules yet so looking forward to this and more players and will update. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 8 Played with 3 and while it was good it was that much longer and screwage was even higher so I think I am leaning towards 2 players is best here. Must now play with the advanced rules and see what it adds...

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Advanced rules add to the game by allowing the use of areas that would otherwise be unplayable by using a Governor(enclosed land or water regions). The Grande allows a rule breaking power by allowing one cab tile to touch more than one land. These are good additions IMO, the translated rules are not so clear but questions in forum shed light.

Like Carcasonne on steroids, this one is one of the best 3 or 4 player games that was once on the market.  It has simple rules with incredibly complex strategic possibilities.

A bidding and tile placement game that revolves around scoring for majorities. My group plays the advanced rules which I recommend. Of late we have seen control of the seas to be the path to victory. We've also seen very defensive play by all allowing each player to set up a "wall" of caballeros. This makes it near impossible to ever remove an opponents caballero card from the board. That being said I'm still enjoying the game.

Describing El Caballero as a thinky action point based gamers' version of Carcassonne is not far off the base although it predates it by three years. Some elements of El Grande are visible as well but these are more cosmetic than gameplay related. It's a bit clunky in its handling of the caballeros and towards the end heavy AP will set in which is why I wouldn't want to play it with more than three players. Recommended but it will be difficult to get table time for it.

Not nearly as brain burning as everyone says - we found it to play very simply, though maybe we weren't thinking enough. While I can see that there are some choices to be made, none of them seem very interesting, and the game feels dated, everything that happens here has been done better in other games that have come out since. It is a mystery to me why RGG insists on reprinting this. 

There is nothing to do with El Grande aside from the graphic design, and this has to be one of the very worst offenders for having too large of a box. It is almost embarrassing how large the box is.

I have only played this game as a 2 and 3 player game.  I really enjoy this game.  I would not call it a difficult game.    I really enjoy it but can not find someone to play.  I enjoy games where there is planning and strategy involved.  This game fits that mold of planning and strategy. I could see how some people may not like the game but I think it is a great game.

I actually prefer El Caballero as a two-player game rather than a multiplayer game. 


[Bill Campbell, '99]
Like Bill, I also prefer this as a two-player game. With more players, it is very hard to plan your actions, and things can get a bit random. It is very easy for players to gang up on a single opponent! Although the rules do not state it, I'd recommend to let the number of available tiles depend on the number of players. Use five tiles with four players only, but with two players, it's best to use only three tiles. 


[Peter Hein van Mulligen, '00]
I agree that El Caballero plays very well with 2 players. It is at least as good as the multiplayer version and may, ultimately, wind up as my preferred way of playing this game.

Got this at the flea market at BGG.con and played it for the first time last weekend.  It's been a long time since we played El Grande, a game many of us like, but rarely seems to find the table, so I thought this one might have better luck, since it seemed somehow lighter.  I loaded up on boats on a big water section, and snuck into a large landmass on the final scoring round to come from dead last after round 1 to tie for the win.  I found the caballero tiles somewhat confusing to work with the first game, but I suspect that will be much easier on the next play.  We managed to learn and play it in about an hour and a half, so I think it will see the table often, and might lead to El Grande being seen regularly too.

I think I would rate this higher if the box weren't so unnecessarily big - makes me cranky. Not sure what to make of the gameplay though. One player dominated the other the entire game...so it may not be good as a two player or it may have just been that one of us couldn't wrap his brain around the mechanics properly.

Not as good as El Grande is - not even close. The biggest problem is, that you can make your moves anywhere --> players turns takes too much time --> downtime problems.

I have always thought it's the missing link between El Grande and Carcassonne (even the date suggests this.)
Having playes the game I'd say it's more in the middle of a triangle where the third corner is Tikal. Surprisingly lot of connections to that 1999 game.

What's my problem with this admittedly good game, this thinking man's Carcassonne? Nothing really, only I think the three corners of the triangle are all better doing what they do, they have a stronger personality. Even though it's a lot deeper than Carcassonne, Carc works better as a streamlined gateway game. And El Grande and Tikal are classiscs, unlike this good one.

While it uses similar terminology as El Grande, this game is very different in gameplay.  Definitely a bit of a brainburner in trying to set yourself up for scoring while taking away or limiting opponent scoring.  Uses the same 1-13 cards as El Grande to determine first to play and number of caballeros in one's court...Vicious, cut-throat game, particularly in the scoring rounds where things change like crazy.  Very AP prone as you analyze all your options.

I like the game quite a bit. My gaming group was not impressed by the game and discredited it for being very abstract (which is true). For me, however, this is simply an El Grande inspired and more strategic Carcassonne, which is a good thing, since I don't like Carcassonne in its pure form that much. =)

This one predates Carcassonne so I’m forced to believe that this has to be an influence. Further it feels like a cross of Carc and El Grande; the latter is no surprise.

It’s incredibly abstract, quite engaging, very tense, and a little too long. It can take some time to build up steam and luck of the draw still has a large impact regardless of the 5 tile display.

Perhaps if this had come earlier in my gaming career it would have been more fascinating and garnered a higher rating, however it’s not the lack of merit the game earns but rather the sheer amount of competition for time it has these days.

Perhaps one day it will see play again, but that wouldn’t keep me from trading this game away.

1 play.  Interesting game that was difficult to visualize how it was going to play out until about 3/4 of the way through.  Until the half-way point I hated it.  But, after that it sort of clicked and I grasped it.  I had a very difficult time with the cabarello discs, their placement on the board and their dual purpose as money/action point and area control value.  Would love to play it again now that I think I know how to play it.

After one game, this one strikes me as rather so-so.  It's not a bad game per se, it's just that there's no real thrill to it, no tension, no big finish.  Perhaps it's because I was taught by someone who remembered key parts of the rules when it was convenient for him.  I'm willing to give it another shot and perhaps raise the rating, but when it come right down to it, I'd rather play El Grande.

Update: played again after many years. Not a very good game. No tension, two players had a bit of a fight over the one large land area. The other two could just watch without much useful to do. Not worth it further exploring, there are so many better games around these days.

Tough first game. It takes a while to get the system and to oversee the consequences. I want to play it again for a better judgement, but it being a Kramer, I must say it did not meet my expectations.

The bidding mechanic in this game is designed to balance turn order and how much a player can do in their turn. After one play it seems that you want to try and disrupt large areas that are dominated by one player. The ocean areas can be very lucrative if one player can grow them and retain exclusivity. Other players should work together to bash the leader, otherwise one player can run away with the game.

Wow! I am amazed anyone would trade this away, but very grateful. A brainburning, brutal classic. El Caballero is a tile laying game with a Conquistador theme. The players are leaders of rival factions attempting to control lands in the New World... but the theme is really quite unimportant.

In turn, players add tiles to expand the map. They also have a limited number of "Caballero tiles" which exert control over land and sea areas. Controlling space generates victory points after four and seven rounds. The crux of the game is that Caballero tiles can only touch one land tile - they are instantly removed if this rule is violated. The game is a cat and mouse affair as players balance turn order, their available supply of Caballeros, and both offensive and defensive placements.

El Caballero comes in a ridiculously oversized box, and the tiles are lightweight, but they look attractive and are quite adequate.

This is a game that turns your brain to mush. Too much analysis required to be a truly enjoyable multi-player game. It should only ever probably be played with 3 reasons being:

- Less down time (which can be considerable - this is a thinking game with spatial gymnastics involved, and twisted thinking along the lines of if I remove my caballero card here, then I can whack his caballero card with this island I just picked up)
- Less chance of you getting sidewhacked by cumulative tile placements from your opponents that you couldn't plan for.

We play the advanced game, it providing for more interesting play than the basic game. It has some clever design features which are fun to explore.

The mechanics and strategy just don't appeal to me for some reason.  Perhaps more play with more players would change that, but I didn't find the theme to be strong enough or the mechanics and strategy to be interesting enough for me to really push to try it again.  I would, but there's so many other games that are worth playing that it's difficult to make a case to try again.

Part of my problem with this game (and Carcasonne, like it) is the lack of a boundary to the board.  If find the lack of limits makes it easy to limit player interaction and reduce or eliminate "the tough choices" that I think really make a game worth playing.

Hasn't been off the shelf in a long time, and not particularly likely to do so that I can see.

This is a tile laying area majority game, where rather than have cubes or meeples, you claim areas with personal tiles, and the number of guys you have in an area is the number printed on the side of the tile facing the land mass. If at any point, your claim tile has two sides touching land masses, it gets removed from the board. This makes the game very strategically punchy, as you vie for position with the other players. There are a lot of options in this game as you get to pick one from a spread of 5 tiles per turn, and you need to manage the number of guys in your supply as well as your turn order, just like in El Grande. I was drawn to it because it solves a lot of issues I always had with carc. Carc has deterministic player order, and restrictive ability to fight people for valuable areas, and the limitation of not being able to plan your turn until you draw your tile. Additionally, you are able to adjust things anywhere on the board rather than just on the one tile you place that turn. This makes the game feel a little slower and heavier than Carcassonne, but a little more rewarding too. The tiles in this game do look extremely dull, and the score track/player aid could be a lot better in terms of clarity.

Note that I don't like area influence games to begin with, nor do I like tile-laying games that involve edge-to-edge matching. El Caballero has so many fiddly rules and exceptions that I end up screwing up one of the rules every time I play. As for game play, it's almost impossible to wrest control away from your opponent's islands.

UPDATE: Raised it to a 6 because I'm trying to force myself to like this game. It's a dense game that's very portable. Visually ugly and unclear: unlike your typical tile laying, edge matching game, you don't get the satisfaction of seeing closed off regions. The game is *so* slow moving compared to El Grande: the board doesn't change as dynamically. However, there's still room for clever screw over your opponent play.

The brain melt factor doesn't come from the amount of decisions you are able to make (there aren't that many) but from the necessity to analyze all the possible ways your opponent can potentially screw you over. And in this game, opponents can *really* screw you over!

It's still difficult to catch up to leaders in this game, though.

UPDATE: Changed from 6 to 7. Now I'm finally playing this game properly. 

PROS:
* You can attack your opponent' influence on land by the "tile popping" mechanic ... I adore this mechanic.

CONS:
* The downtime is atrocious. Because of the threat of having your caballeros popped of the playing area, players must consider every tile laying possibility during bidding for turn order *and* during the tile placement phase.
* Still, one of the most visually inelegant games I own

UPDATE: Dropped from a 7 to a 5.

* It's simply too difficult to dislodge an opponent's control from a territory. There are simply not enough tiles played during the game to do this. In addition, there are quite a few restrictions in playing the Caballero tiles. There are usually not enough openings to play these control tiles next to islands. Also, opportunities to pop opponent's off the board don't happen that frequently.

Compare this to Carcassone where you have more freedom to place your control markers (meeples) and have enough tiles to attempt to take over other opponent's territories -- or rather, have enough tiles to have territories for yourself.

* There's another problem with not having enough tiles to play: turn order is incredibly important. So there has to be a turn order auction before every round, which dramatically slows down play.

Every Ulrich-and-Kramer game I've ever played seems to reveal its depth only after several plays. Princes of Florence, El Grande, and now El Caballero all follow this pattern. El Caballero looks like a Carcassone variant, but turns out to be much deeper!

I like this one.  Clever, aggressive.  Good with 3 players.  Some of the logic is wacky, but it is an engaging, if somewhat abstract game.  The randomness of the area tiles can matter sometimes which is nice.  The generation of caballeros doesn't feel as tight a system as it could be, but overall a very enjoyable game.

I played this game only once so far, but am looking forward to a second attempt.  Interesting mechanics create a much spicier and thoughtful tile laying game.  Each turn has a lot of stuff to think about and tatics to execute - plenty is going on here.  Brain burner, but fun.

A mix between El Grande and Carcassonne. Sort of Advanced Carcassonne, and since I played Conquistador before the popular Carcassone game, Carcassonne never made it to the table in our gaming group. Will never be bought as well. No need to buy seventeen expansions either!

RATING: 7
Rated after one play.

Plays like a fusion of El Grande and Carcassonne. As in El Grande, players compete to exert influence over areas on a map to gain victory points. But the map, itself, grows via tile placement, much like Carcassonne.

As in Carcassonne, tactics involve players laying tiles in such a way that only they can benefit from the resulting areas, or in such a way that they gain advantage from areas other players supposed to have claimed for themselves.

A strange and unique game that exemplifies the term "brainburner."
Superficially borrows the structure of el grande, but radically departs from it in almost every way. It's a bit nastier than a typical area control due to the potential forced removal of caballeros, and it's easy to leave an "opening" for an oponent to attack if the options are not carefully studied each turn. The advanced rules make the game exponentially better with an extra layer of strategic depth. El Caballero is a sleeper hit that's certain to grow on you if you give it a chance.

As I liked Carcassonne (actually, Carcassonne H&G), I like El Caballero. It is certainly a more substantial game, with a great many more options to do on your round, and some interesting tactical side-effects owing to the way the rotation of the caballero tiles interact on the board.

But seemed to get crowded on the board real fast.

RATING: 5
Well...this certainly allows you some paralyzing thought processes!
The similarities with Carc are slight, in Carc you are trying to get into areas and others out whereas here you are trying to get others into your land area in order to get them out!!
The battle for the seas are as intriguing as those for the land...so many choices...
Certainly a game where some sort of friendly timer could possibly be used otherwise this game could lose all its charm. Just over an hour for 3 players is about right.
Great stuff!!

[1 play] It was late in the evening so we weren't as sharp as we could have been to be learning this game (and we chose to play the expanded game). So it took partway into the second round before we were figuring out what was going on. I think we mostly enjoyed it, but I'll reserve a more definitive judgment until I can play it again.

Anyway, I can say that this is a highly confrontational game, not as elegant in mechanics and theme as other Kramer designs, and the learning curve is steeper than other games of this weight. For those who have played El Grande, the comparisons are inevitable, and I can't help but think that the designer of Carcassonne must have been heavily influenced by El Caballero.

Most recent play 9-14-07 with Corey, Michael, and Alex.

Don't think that this game has anything to do with El Grande, just look at it as a better Carcassonne, after much was stolen from this game to make that one.  I don't understand the whole brain burner labeling that this game gets it is a pretty simple game.  Works well with two.  My only problem with the game is that it seems to lack heart, what that means intrinsically I can't tell you.  But, as much as I think this is a well designed game I will never love it.  Perhaps, it is that there is no long term strategy, as it feels over at the point where it could be getting great.  Regardless, I never have felt attached to any of my moves, they only just felt like the "best" and "only" good move.

UPDATE: This is now over 10 years old and it still stands up to an occasional playing.  I offers more choices than what I initially had assumed, but most of the time you are still hunting for the best choice.  Your path and long term strategy is often more determined by what is left available for you by other players (yes that is most games, but it feels more obvious and channeled here).  It's fine, but nothing to jump up and down about.

Wonderful game - I find this game very intense and the tactical nature of it is exhilerating ... Who wants first choice of tiles, Which one will they pick, What will they try to accomplish this turn, How will it affect me? What options will I have based on the different tiles available this turn ?  Feels like a horse race to the finish.

Solid game, but an odd mix of Carcassonne and El Grande. There's nothing in El Caballero that I dislike, but I like both Carcassonne and El Grande better, and I can't help but think of them when playing this. Partly it's the gameplay. Partly it's the aesthetics. But those games cast long shadows; in those shadows, El Caballero gets lost.

While I chuckled at the sub-title calling El Caballero “a refined strategy game,” (what makes a strategy game refined?), I really enjoyed this game. It reminded me a lot of Carcassonne but with more elements, more trade-offs, and more strategy. Basically, you play as explorers following Columbus as he discovers new islands. The Caballeros are your “minions” that you have at your disposal to assist in taking over territory, purchasing ships, or building Castillos. You have both a supply and a court which houses “activated” Caballeros. Disperse them wisely to take ownership of land or sea. While definitely not the most important element of the game, keep a close eye on the gold and fish tiles which increase the value of your area control.

There are many trade-offs in this game that are very balanced. Firstly, do you want to go first at the expense of receiving more Caballeros that round, or do you concede a tile placement to receive more Caballeros? Do you focus on hurting the other player(s) or do you hunker down and build up your own wealth (if you can figure out how to do both at the same time, you’ll be in great shape!). How far do you push to obtain ownership of land (which is worth double the value of sea)?

Tip: Really, really try take advantage of every opportunity you can to harm the other player while building yourself up. In order of priority, here is what I would focus on: 1. Destroy another’s tile while placing a tile that greatly benefits you. 2. Block another’s expansion while playing a tile that benefits you. 3. Place a tile that benefits your expansion. 4. Destroy or block another player. 5. Place a tile to protect your investment. I would say #4 and #5 are interchangeable. Recognize that the return on investment can fluctuate with all of these scenarios, but I would keep this priority list as a general guideline. Tip #2: The cost of protecting your investment with a Castillo is well worth it. Unless it’s completely blocked from being destroyed, I wouldn’t play a single tile (if at all possible) without a Castillo. Tip #3: While the land ownership is worth double points at the end, don’t overlook the value of placing ships to capture sea points!

Overall, I really like this game. I did get frustrated at times at how easily my hard-earned investments could be completely wiped out at the play of a tile. The game has a very “attack-or-die” feel to it which I like (but I know some don’t). I give it a 7 with a high recommendation to give it a shot.

Interesting and fairly complex tile-laying game. I much prefer this game with two players, because adding more means much less control. In that case, you really can't plan ahead, because chances are that at least somebody will screw up what you're trying to do. I prefer the advanced version, which is actually not much harder than the base version.
It's been ages since I played this; it really should hit the table again some time soon.

Single play: 4 players; basic game. I had to teach everyone straight from the printed rules, so while we were pretty clear on what we could do, we had to learn why we might do things, and how we might achieve things as we went along. In my case, the second scoring was dramatically better than the first. Approaching it as a mere stepping stone between El Grande & Carcassonne is misleading; attacking & defending are essential skills to pick up.

Beaucoup plus rapide que El Grande car il n'y a pas de cartes de mouvement de cubes (qui fonctionnent comme à King of Siam). C'est surtout un jeu de tuiles.

On peut se faire voler une majorité par le simple fait qu'on se retrouve à jouer premier ou deuxième dans le tour de scoring.

I get the game, and I think that it has some very tough choices to make, based on the weird situations that arise in the game.  I just find that the game is heavily balanced toward the PROactive side, instead of the REactive side.  This is fine and good, it's just that I tend to do very poorly at these sorts of games, and I wind up being more frustrated with the experience than anything else.  It's simply too hard for me to figure out how to arrange the board to make something pop, and by the time I do, I've already been smoked by the other player.  It's just too much like work.

Although called the sequel to El Grande, El Caballero shares very few aspects with its namesake. This game is a fun but intense brain-burner in which players explore and attempt to control the lands and waterways of the New World. 'Exploration' in El Caballero consists of picking and placing land tiles that are most favorable to you, and 'control' is attained by having the most caballeros camped on the edges of the resulting land masses.

I like the exploration, but I'm not sure I like the maneuvering in this game (any more than I like similar style maneuvering in Carcassonne). I also feel like some of it is superfluous like bidding for turn order using power cards and managing caballeros (a mechanic lifted from El Grande). Where turn order in El Grande really feels like it matters, here it seems to not matter too much (or at least not in proportion to the amount of thinking you're doing when choosing a power card).

After 1 Play: My only play of this left me pretty lost.  You really want to lock in points, but this is nearly impossible to do completely.  I'd need more plays to fully understand it, but I'm not sure if I like it enough to put in the effort.

As someone who followed the Kickstarter, this game delivers MORE than what was promised. The gameplay is great and fairly simple, which is important as a miniatures game. The game is also extremely flexible on rules and the various scenarios within the game. The game really makes you feel like you're in control of a group of Survivors in The Walking Dead world.

For me this is a typical Mantic game - the rules are simple and easy to learn but there is enough depth there to keep me coming back for more.  As the threat level increases this game becomes very tactical too. Recommended.

Es un juego que salió por kickstarter. Multitud de figuritas, atrezzos y demás. Es para uno o dos jugadores. No tiene un tablero propiamente dicho, sino que se contruyen escenarios con elementos de atrezzo y la misión depende de cada escenario. Hay eventos y cada jugador puede llevar varios hérores.. aunque imagino que eso dependerá del escenario.
Las acciones y sus consecuencias dependen de distancias y niveles de alarma. El ruido es un factor a tener en cuenta, porque puede atraer a los zombies. 
Es un juego de escaramuzas y escenarios, con objetos y demás. Es entretenido y sobre todo muy espectacular. Los escenarios tienen pinta de ser cortos.
Es un juego muy caro. Incluye mucho material y muy exclusivo.

Played the PnP version and had a blast using proxies. Will rate again after receiving and playing the game with proper miniatures. Therefore, the rating should be higher.
Well, I received the game and played and love it! 
Finished painting the Walkers using monochrome colour scheme and I'm almost finished painting the survivors.
So much fun. This game is the one that my eldest lad (17 years old) asked me to play. So, I raise the rating accordingly!

Surprisingly excellent game. It's all about unpredictable narrative outcomes spiraling out of control. A miniatures game where the zombies are dynamic terrain and you're really taking on an opposite group. It feels like a smoother implementation of what All Things Zombie (the miniature game) was trying to do.

A wonderful game that is true to the original graphic novel. Hopefully they will expand into the TV series characters too. Rule are easy to pick up with the included tutorials. If you can get your hands on a Kickstarter edition, you will not be disappointed; so many many more miniatures and 3D terrain (vehicles and scatter). The miniatures are second to none, when it comes to board games. The quality looks like highly detailed styrene plastc models, usually only found in multi-part wargaming models. The best that Mantic has produced.  I can not wait to produce my own 3D game boards and buildings to make the gaming experience more immersive.

I really love this game system. It offers a great AI for how the walkers are controlled, as well as a lot of variety in characters, equipment and supplies. Of course though, that is if you buy more than just the base set. The base set is nice and gives you a good way to learn the game and decide if you want to get more into it. If you enjoy the base game and want to expand, I would recommend the Days Gone By expansion as a first next purchase. 

This game is also great because you can play it in so many ways. You can play solo, co-op, 1v1 or team vs team. You can play on a small 20"x20" play area or a 6'x4' play area. You can create your own characters with the rules from the Days Gone By expansion, and scenarios are easy to create as well for those that want to.

This skirmish level miniatures game takes a fairly typical build and makes it exceptional through the use of AI controlled walkers infesting the map. The use of the Walking Dead comic IP is strong here, many of the characters are present with thematic rules and scenarios are available that allow you to recreate the events of the story. The quality is also pretty high while Mantic have managed to keep the cost a bit lower than other similar games.

Very fast, frantic, and tense skirmish game. Fast to set up and play. The ability to manipulate the walkers movement to draw them into combat with your opponent makes the game very unique.

My only concern is for how much variety we will get in the scenarios. Mantic's Mars Attacks game had great story variety... I hope this lives up to the same standards. The two learn to play scenarios felt very generic but I have yet to play the 'real' scenarios...

One of the biggest surprises with the game is how many modes it supports...  It plays solo, 2 player vs, co op, and in team formats...

-- update after playing prelude to Woodbury--

So far this introductory rule set is much clearer than the retail set for teaching the game and introducing gameplay concepts. The introductory scenarios (from Kickstarter version) had you play 5 solo scenarios with event cards not designed for solo! They also were designed to play with characters that weren't included requiring you to redesign them to work for existing characters. This resulted in a negative first impression.

This solo expansion is a far better introductory experience and the final scenario is brilliant in its theme and difficulty. I hope they end up creating more brutal/thematic scenarios like this. This one scenario really captures the soul of the franchise without having to copy scenes from the comic. The great thing is that this is a theme that is implied but never shown... these are the types of moments the game designers should focus on.

My first Kickstarter - base game plus Woodbury and Prison expansion. I passed on the custom mats as shipping to the US would have been prohibitive. I followed the development and liked the concepts and figures. Having read the nearly finalized rulebook, and using the print and play test components, I am happy that I decided to go with this game. Will update rating and comments when it arrives later this year.

“Don’t open... Dead inside.” This miniatures combat game takes an additional step. Instead of just being a simple combat game of one side versus the other side, both sides also have to deal with the eponymous Walking Dead. The walkers are a third faction that are controlled by no one player, instead reacting to the actions of both players and being driven by events. Actions like firing guns or running or simply shouting can attract nearby walkers and cause havoc on a situation making each move on the board more than a simple question of, “How do I get the other guy?” This game holds tons of depth and with options to play solo scenarios based on the comics or with others in head to head battles, each game is truly a test of your survival skills.

Miniatures game with board game components. Easy and smooth. 1-2. Solo mode! Cool playmats (base game ones are in paper). Money sink. :-)

You have to purchase an additional starter set (Prelude to Woodbury) for the solo scenario and full solo rules (as well as the solo event deck).

Might be cool with my sons, one day.

Finally saw the sculpts, and they look fine, not chunky like the KS, at least by themselves. However, I don't like that they only put two characters from the comic into the base game box, and one "name" character per mini-expansion.

From Miniature Market:
* Core set: $40. USD Carl and Rick.
* Days Gone Bye: $32. USD Dale.
* Miles Behind Us: $32. USD No one, unless you're a Hershel and Otus fan.

For Michonne, Glenn, Andrea, Negan, etc. each mini-expansion is $16 USD each.  Seems pretty obvious that they're milking the franchise as much as they can, when they could have packaged multiple "name" characters together.

Great game, even if you're not into minis...the skirmish system is easy to understand and plays fast. The best part for me was the walker movement and the threat level, that really put pressure on the players as well as being a tactic element that you have to manage. Overall, excellent game!

The mechanics of the game are excellent! Panic, threat, nerve, noise and mayhem are all accounted for, as well as solid yet simple skirmish/shooting rules. Mantic has gifted a wonderful canvas for players to create their own thematic narrative missions and it has been inspiring seeing people bring their post apocalyptic game-board  worlds to life.

A rapid game that always allows for something cinematic to happen (usually to one of the heroes)

The speed of the games, does allow to link 1,2 or 3 into a small narative of the course of a few hours

It does need a scenario though (starter set provides you with the supply run and the story mode gives you ideas) as a 'deathmatch' can be a grind

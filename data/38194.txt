This is another older game. We played a 6-player game and I liked it alright. This one plays where there are several 'monsters' laid out in a display. Then everyone secretly selects one, two or three of them to 'win' the match. Each monster has a value from 1 to 10. So you'd think it'd be obvious - the highest value wins, so everyone should select 10, right? Not so fast! There's two other things to consider. First, there is a 'judge' for the match - another card that is revealed in which some cards are not allowed and a maximum 'mana' value is set. Second, players take turns playing 'spells' (with a mana cost) to each monster. So you could play to boost that goblin because you want him to win - or play to reduce the value of the dragon that you want to lose. That's the idea - very simple. Some cards are played face down - so you can't tell exactly what's happening. Other cards are used to do crazy things - like swap monsters, reverse values, dismiss cards - crazy stuff. This is a game you have to just let that happen - it's full of chaos. But if you take it as that, it's alot of fun. Silly to be sure - but fun. Seems to support 6 players just fine too.

I give it a thumbs up. But again, not a game I have to own just yet.

RATING: 5
This game is like Colossal Arena but good. You spend the game playing the role of a wizard betting on monsters fighting in a arena and using your magic to impact the outcome. The trick is other mages are also betting on the monsters and doing the same thing but no one knows who is betting on who or who is casting what spells on which monster until the end of the round. A fun game with the same artist that did one of the love letters and chronicle.

Kind of a silly, twisted version of a betting game.  Reminded me somewhat of [b]Magical Athlete[/b] and [b]Colossal Arena[/b].  It's very confrontational.  With its short length, you won't be angry for long if you have a bad beat.  Good fun in a short time.

RATING: 5.5
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Light, quick and portable filler game, but also very chaotic and difficult to control. Ever if I think that probably a lot of people are going to like this unpredictability of the game, it's a little too much for my taste. The production also doesn't particularly resonate with me. Cards and coin tokes are very good quality and probably very resistant, but I find the artwork to be a bit mute. It's not bad, but I don't really like it either.

So, if the idea of wizards taking part in a bidding war over fantasy creatures fighting in an arena is admittedly fresh... the game unfortunately doesn't shine for me, especially in comparison with other titles in the same category. I surely would rather play something like Biblios over this one. Unfortunately mediocre.

RATING: 5
1st play: Funny, quick playing card game with reveal moments and the judges provide a cool "busting" aspect. Not super deep, but a fun filler with a funny theme.

2nd play: Still liked it. Plays very fast, and good reveal moments.

RATING: 6
Decent take-that game with three betting rounds. Since the amount of rounds are finite there could be a problem if one player takes a big lead in the beginning. Makes it easier to figure out the other player's bets and could ruin the experience somewhat.

The basic premise is similar to Knizia's Colossal Arena.  Monsters do gladiatorial battle, while the players try to bet on the winner and influence the outcome accordingly.  Cheaty Mages amusingly casts the players as mages who cheat by casting spells to effect the outcome.  Each round a different judge modifies the rules; limiting the amount of mana that can be spent on any monster and possibly declaring a spell type illegal.

Cheaty Mages is pretty chaotic, the more so with higher numbers of players.  Nonetheless, it has the filler virtues of quick explanation, set-up and play.  There is plenty of variation in the spell cards, resulting in dramatic reverses of fortune and plenty of laughter.

The original Japanese artwork isn't great and I'm surprised that AEG didn't opt for a Love Letter style makeover.  Production quality is pretty good and the rules are clear.

RATING: 7
Bet on creatures that fight in an arena, and throw down spells to mess with the results. This is certainly a good enough game to appease a Beer & Pretzels crowd that wants something light, silly, vicious and thematic. But not Seiji Kanai's best design.

A pretty game and thematic game of betting on monsters, and then playing cards on them to make them win.

Altogether fun, light game, with beautiful artwork.

The only issue I have with the game is that because of the way you bet, you could easily be out of the game, with no hope of winning when it comes to the last round.

This game is crazy and chaotic, and I did find it to be somewhat enjoyable. The idea is very reminiscent of Colossal Arena, but things are a little more chaotic here, which isn't normally a bad thing for me. One aspect I found lacking is simply the fact that each player was somewhat hamstrung by the cards they are dealt. Of course this is true in almost any card game, but it just seemed that certain cards were overpowered and played a much more significant role in the game. My #1 biggest issue is that I just don't love games where people all secretly set their own goals, and sometimes they will heavily overlap with others. This simultaneous secret choice creates unintentional alliances that the other players can't hope to benefit from, so they find themselves on the outside looking in. It's different in Colossal Arena, because there you can throw a late bet on a monster if you see yours getting ready to bite the dust, but here you're stuck so you just have to hope you were fortunate enough to select the same monster(s) as other players. I don't mean to overly criticize this game, because I did have a very enjoyable time playing, I'm just not sure it is right for me.

The game that Colossal Arena wishes it was...

The game actually offers some really tough choices, and by not always drawing back up to your max hand size, you really have to decide when it is best to go all out.  Really looking forward to more plays of this.  4p was fun, but I expect that the game would actually get better with more players.

My group has played this one 2x now and it's currently one of those games that I'd be happy to play anytime with anyone. It's a lot of fun and has a good amount of cheat to win / press your luck going for it. The only problem I have with it is that it can tend to have a problem with players being able to catch up if someone hits a longshot bet in Round 1. This has happened in both of our games and leads to the other players needing to make crazy and sometimes foolish plays in attempting to catch up. Really good game though!

Was scared by the comparisons to Colossal Arena, of which I'm not fond, but has much more going on than that.  Chaotic, but short enough that it's not a huge problem.  Rating based on one play, expect it to change -- not sure yet whether up or down.

Update 2015-09: 3 player is way better with 10 cards per player. This is how we'll play it from now on. 

Much better as a 4-player game - there are 8 more cards in play and the risk of going over the mana limit is commensurately higher. 3-player should really have 10 cards per player, minimum. Jo didn't seem to care for it much, though, so probably we'll be stuck playing 3er a lot. Still, the kids enjoy it and I'm glad we have it.

The theme is fun and the art is cute. Unfortunately there is very little strategy since you often have no idea what other people have bid on, so you just end up spending most of the game trying to waste your turn in order to get a better sense of what's going on. It's very chaotic, which can be fun, especially when the face down cards produce unexpected surprises (we ALL bet on that card?!), but at the end of the day it's only OK. I probably wouldn't turn down a play, but I'd rather play Love Letter.

I bought this on a whim because it was by the designer of Love Letter, but it has become one of my favorite games to play with people that aren't really into board games. So far, every time I have played it has been a blast. It's got cool art, a really fun theme (I suggest enthusiastically reading the intro if there's anyone new playing the game), easy to learn, bluffing, portability, low price, and I love how tense every turn is. The only negative I've found is that if one player gets way ahead the first round, that can either guarantee them the win, or force everyone to bet on a limited choice of monsters in the next 2 rounds. However, I found the game was still pretty fun even when that happened. One more thing I like about it is even if you've played it a bit, new players still have a decent chance of winning.

People say Clossosus Arena is better but I didn't like it as much. While Colossus might be more sophisticated, it can be pretty confusing to new players and it takes itself too seriously. Cheaty Mages is cute, silly, and much better for non-gamers.

I expect this game will be hammered by many for being way too random.   It certainly can be chaotic.  However, there are some interesting decisions as you weigh the mana totals in your head, and simultaneously try to decide who you think is currently winning.   Also, choosing which cards to hold for future rounds can be important.   Not deep at all, but has enough choice that I enjoy it, even though there's not a ton of control.   Good artwork, too.... very distinct and original, in the same style as the black-box Love Letter.

This is a fun thematic game that is very unique.  In it, the players are all mages at an arena betting on monster fights.  You see what monsters are fighting, you place your bets, and then, because you're mages, you subtly cast a spell or so to try to effect the outcome of the monster fight in your favor.  Simple to pick up, understand, and play.

-fairly quick and simple (~30 mins)

-simplistic card art (very minor)
-possible to have no chance of winning before game ends, i.e. game is still a card game and is luck based

This game is based on three elements that I find very annoying: high randomness, low effect of player actions (i.e. it doesn't really matter what you do) and deduction/bluffing. I should have read up on the game before playing, as it was now it felt much, much longer than it really was.

Definitely not for me.

Learning the rules took all of 5-10 minutes and after the first round, even our 10 year old made some good bluffs. 

I believe winning is a bit random with 5 as there are too many adversaries to counteract but it does not matter; very quick and FUN game!

You play cards on fighters, not the players, and thus it is not a direct confrontation, a good thing if you have children who get upset if they felt they were being picked on.

I bought the game after our play and I expect it will see regular plays.

The short playing time makes it a good game to play at lunch.

Really fun, filler style game in the same vein as Love Letter.  Unlike Love Letter, this game seems to have gone under the radar, which is a shame because I think it deserves more praise.  Like any filler game, it's not going to blow you away, but Cheaty Mages is worth your time.

A game I purchased because it was designed by Seiji Kanai, who was popular for a while. 

Doesn't seem to have enough room for interesting or subtle play. Also, the secret bidding seems prone to multiple player bidding on the same fighter. 

It's not bad by any means, but Colossal Arena is better and widely available.

This is a fun little filler game that can get really intense as the game progresses. I loved betting on a character and then tossing out spells to help ensure his/her victory! This is half trying to predict what your opponent is doing and half randomly throwing stuff on the field to help your bet.

RATING: 6
Fun and (very) chaotic game of predicting which monster card from a selection of 5 will accrue the most influence. The monsters each have starting influence to which the players can add / subtract through card play, some of which is face up, some face down.

Sometimes you'all do well, but at others you'll be the only player supporting a monster in which case you're screwed.

Very reminiscent of Knizia's Colossal/Titan Arena.

This is a pretty great little card game. Players take the role of wizards at an arena who bet on competitors and then cast spells in order to try to make sure their chosen combatant wins. Some spells are played face up, some face down, so you never know for sure what's going on. This is a surprisingly thinky game, and a lot of fun.

Update: I still like this game, but it suffers from an issue where frequently at least one player will be playing the 3rd round with no hope of winning. It doesn't ruin the game completely, but it makes me a lot less eager to play it. I'm lowering my rating from 7.75 to a 6.

Quick card game where you secretly bet on various fantasy monsters/people and then everyone plays cards either face up or down to each of these creatures to help them or hurt them.  At the end, the cards are resolved to find out who "wins" the duel amongst the monsters and then the bets are resolved.  Amusing zippy card game with hidden information.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This reminds me a bit of Colossal Arena although with quite a bit more chaos and randomness in the "spell" cards.  Still, I find it enjoyable in the different ways cards are played (different types of spells work differently), different monsters, and the different judges which also effect the winning conditions.  This is a betting game in which you can bet on three creatures (you win half the gold if one of them win), or bet on two creatures (and win the full sum of the creature), or bet on one creature (and win double the gold prize).

This is one of my favorite underappreciated AEG games. It has everything you'd want in a fantasy underground cage match: betting, sabotage, divine judges, crazy fantasy creatures, and magic missiles. My tried and true strategy of betting for two of the middle HP creatures has led to a ~80% win rate at this game. Don't get me wrong. I like challenging myself and trying new games, but every once in a while, it's fun to play a game you know you'll probably win.

Another great Kanai game with a ton of theme and excellent play in a tiny box.  Take on the role of a magic slinging mage attending a monster tournament.  Secretly fire off your magic at the monsters to swing the odds in your favor.  But you aren't the only mage willing to cheat.

Be careful though as there are judges that will shut the whole thing down if you are too over the top with your magic.

That's the game in a nutshell.  Brilliantly done and small enough to fit in your pocket.

This is a fun "heavier" party game.  That is, it's just complex enough that I couldn't easily break it out with any old group on non-gamers.

This is one of those games that gives you a sense of control over chaos.  I believe that luck will always determine the outcome, but players can make steps to position themselves to best take advantage of the chaos.  Still, bad hands of cards, choosing a winner that nobody else at the table backed, or a random move by an opponent can and will knock you out of (or into!) the running.

This game is more choatic and luck driven than I'd normally like, but the fast play time, small deduction element, generation of table banter and brinkmanship save it.  I've found the game can be very group dependent.

RATING: 7
This is what I wished Colossal Arena had been. Monsters battling, hidden bids by players and lots of spells flying around to help. Love the hidden spells (Enchants). Love the spells that do crazy stuff (switch bids, judges, etc.) It's light, so I'm not going to suggest playing it often. But it's a fun filler.

Borrows some ideas from [thing=105]Titan: The Arena[/thing] in that you're betting on who's going to win a battle and then playing cards to try to affect the outcome. The theme matches up as you're a wizard casting spells (cheating) to affect the outcome of battle. 

Bets and cards played are blind though making for a lot of randomness but you can hedge your bets (receiving a lower payout) and see who played cards where and how many cards were placed on monsters. The deck of cards you can play cast spells, lower or decrease power. Also, a random judge is drawn each round who has rules on what can / cannot be played.

Its fun and quick with cool art. Just don't expect too much depth.

What a great theme!  Was tricky because what I thought were the "normal rules" were actually the first round judge's effects.  By the third round it seemed everyone was way behind the leader and we all bet on the long shot and made sure he'd win...but the leader did as well!  So, a bit anti-climactic.  After one play, I think it would be better if there were points for 1st, 2nd and 3rd monster instead of the winner taking all.  And it would be neat if the surviving monsters actually fought each other with dice according to their remaining power, and I could make fun battle noises and so on.  So there seems to be a lot of room for improvement.  But great theme!

The last round can be anticlimactic, though, if one player has a sizable lead. The guy behind has to bet on a specific fighter and the leader can hedge between 3.

A fun concept, but earlier rounds can dominate over later rounds. A leader going into round three can simply bet on the weak monsters.  If the losing player bids there, then they both win and the winning player still wins.  If the losing player bids on a safer monster, it may not pay out enough to catch up to the winner anyway.

RATING: 7.3
Players bet on who will win a fight between various monsters. Then they throw spells to muddle things up a bit. If you are prepared to accept having your bet destroyed by some cleverly cast spell - which I do, then this is a very entertaining filler.
It is even more exciting on early plays when you don't know what spells may be cast!

Way too random for my tastes. Too many people betting on the same creatures, too much hidden information to be strategic, and not enough control over what cards you're able to play. I can see how some would like this, but it's a little too chaotic for me.

詐賭巫師，維持設計師Seiji Kanai的一貫風格，各卡牌都有簡單卻又不失調皮趣味的插畫風格，但因為小品所以美術遊戲配件只能達成某種等級而已，不過整體品質尚能配上價格，讓人可以接受。

規則:0.8
先決定裁判，以及出場的怪物，然後下注，接著怪物上場廝殺，我們的巫師開始輪流動手腳詐賭，最後看看那個怪物存活並且能力值最高，你就獲得你押注的獎金。遊戲就怎麼簡單好懂，除了一些功能牌需要解說注意外!基本上都是推坑新手的好遊戲!

要決定裁判、怪物、個人籌碼及壓牌號碼，分發手牌。很簡單就可以開一局。

路線:0.2
本遊戲從下注那一隻怪物開始，大致上就是讓它能力爆表、超過裁判的容許值，自動出局。基本上還是依據對手的行動來選擇行動，很難做到某種程度的規劃。且本遊戲很吃牌運及賭運，有時候隨便亂打還是會贏。

互動:0.8 
本遊戲基本上就是很吃玩家間的互動，幾乎所有微桌遊都帶有這種強烈玩家互動的傾向，或許規則變化不大，需要靠玩家互動來撐起場子。

個人:0.5
個人接受度算高，有時候策略遊戲玩多了，還是需要一點點刺激又無厘頭的派對遊戲。

朋友:0.8 
小朋友超愛的，因為規則簡單又有賭博下注的感覺，勝負感很強烈，一些太和平勝負趕不強烈的遊戲，就難激起朋友間的火花，大人朋友也覺得還不錯。

想玩:0.6 
可以偶爾開一下，尤其是過年，小賭可以怡情，但本遊戲勝負不確定因素過多，遊戲時可能會發生吵架，要小心為妙!

收藏:0.6
價格不貴，體積小，可以方便開，且又是帶有主題性的賭博遊戲，可以收藏一下，順便鼓勵東方的遊戲設計師。

RATING: 5
Place a secret guess on which of the 5 monsters will win, based on absolutely no information, then play spells to either improve your monster or downgrade another monster. Improvement spells are much better than downgrade spells (your monster is "up" against 4 other monsters, whereas with downgrades you've only sent 1 down and the other 4 are effectively "up"), so drawing good and powerful spells is luck based and important. Of course if you're playing with 4 other players, you're only going to contribute 20% of the spells, so even drawing great spells isn't enough. Your strategy in this game is to guess (with absolutely no info) what 1 or 2 other players are also going to bet on and hope your monster gets up with your combined effort. Which makes for a fairly pointless gaming exercise. There's a modicum of fun when all the hidden (about half) played spells are revealed (see, even more pointless, you have no idea even while you're playing spells what's up and what's not), where the winning monster is found and bets revealed. It's for those who like the theme and don't mind some mindlessness for 20 minutes.

[b]THIS is what I wanted Colossal Arena to be !![/b] Applause and Thank You Seiji Kanai, Noboru Sugiura, Kanai Factory, and AEG for this updated addition to the AEG small box line.

Players are mages betting on and casting cheating spells on fantasy monster battles before the eyes of various judges. This is easy to teach and learn. Playing it rocks. I could play this again and again.

I haven't tried this with 3. My wife and I enjoy skyzero's 2 player variant:

Nothing original here, seems like I have played a few games exactly like this one in the last year. Five monsters come out and you can bet one one, two or three of them. Next you each play cards, some face up and some face down to alter the power or reward of each monster. The monster with the most power wins and as a result if you bet on him you win gold. Seems like they will surely add new cards as it is really basic, which is like buying half a game and setting yourself up for future purchases. Nothing original.

Rules are very simple and gameplay generally is pretty quick with the right people. Not sure how well this game plays with more than 4, but it's quick enough and light enough to not really matter how lucky people can get. I love the artwork and the theme. My only complaint is the card quality is a bizarre smooth finish that makes the game REALLY hard to shuffle and a couple of the cards aren't as clear as they could be. Also, the rules contradict each other in a few spots, but it's nothing terribly bad.

I really liked  this game. With 3 players there's strategy with 5 there's crazy fun. And quick. Little bit too much setup and a little too complicated unless you're going to play it regularly. My group didn't like it so I gave it away.

8.5 - Played a few games and it works really well, some take that, some strategy, some magic, and some betting all come together to make a game that's fun and fairly quick to teach and learn. I've dropped the rating only because the game doesn't have a lot of replayability because of the limited gladiators.  I hope AEG does an update because I love the theme and feel of the game.

Found this to be just awful. Wouldn't have been so bad if a few of the cards didn't simply trump all others, but as some do, just awful. One card removed all other cards played on a monster, which invalidated like 6-7 cards the rest of us had been playing. Game just felt entirely random with the only players having any real control the few who drew the really good cards, while the rest just didn't even matter. Will never play again.

A Kniziaesque design not very far from Royal Turf or Colossal Arena, though faster and simpler than both. If a player does well in the first 2 rounds the third round could be meaningless as they could be impossible to catch because a player can't lose money. I still find this fun, it's a take-that game where you beat on the fighters instead of the other players, and revealing the cards at the end of the rounds is pretty dramatic. - :thumbsup:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Erm...no. It's very chaotic. There's no way to recover from a crap hand. Also, nothing you can do with a crappy hand. Plus, crap hands. 

You know how Knizia will take an okay game, Kniziaze it and make it way, way better? It's like someone did that in reverse with Knizia's Colossal Arena.

Cast spells on a Colosseum battle between fantasy monsters. A fun card playing game of changing the strength of different monsters and trying to get your bets to win at the end.

I usually play with a house rule where if you bet on one you instead get an extra 50% and NOT double your bet. If you double the winning then everyone MUST do that or have no chance of winning the game.

RATING: 6
Super light filler game.  There are lot's of potentially fun ways to manipulate a good hand of cards, but ultimately, there are so many crazy things that can happen that whatever you do can really be thrown to the wind.  So, you have to take the attitude of knowing you are just tossing a bunch of cards down and seeing what happens.

Sadly, it is also easy to get a crap hand (especially with 5 players).  The hand size is so constraining that while it makes the hand management aspect rather fun, it also makes the potential for competitiveness fragile. This is the kind of game that would be better if they threw out the weak cards, and just embraced the chaos. More times than not there isn't enough information on the board to make an educated decision, so why bother trying to limit anything?

RATING: 7
Like Colossal Arena, but with some actual fun! Plays pretty quickly, too.

--- Summary ---
A random set of monsters (differing base strengths 1-10 and payoffs if win round) fight in the arena. Each round, a random judge is chosen. Each judge varies in the amount of magic they allow to be played, and may have other restrictions as well. Players (wizards) first "place bets" on which monster(s) they think will win the round: betting on 1 creature pays double base value; 2 --> pay base value; 3 --> pay half. On your turn, play a card (some are played face up, some face down) on a creature or pass; round ends when all pass. Then reveal all cards, apply judges rules, and see who won. After 3 rounds, the player with the most money wins the game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun filler. Bluffing element is often negligible because the cards that people get are random. Game could be improved with some sort of drafting system. The runaway leader problem could potentially be fixed by having the game end in 5 rounds instead of 3.

I like that it is short and has betting, but the card play is pretty weak, and it feels awfully chaotic.  With 3, if 2 people end up betting on the same monster, it is very likely to win.  Also, if your hand is terrible, it is going to stay that way, and there is nothing you can do.

An odd little game; it's swingy and pretty random because of the card draws, but it's also oddly engaging.

Cheaty Mages is a gambling game where 5 mythical creatures battle each other and you bet on the winners.  Each player can play spells on the various creatures to help or hinder them.  There are various judges that can disqualify creatures if certain criteria are exceeded (usually if too many spells are cast on them).  The bets are made in secret at the start of the fight and weaker monsters give better odds than stronger monsters.  Some spells are face down and some are face up.  [b]It's simple and plays quick, and does a nice job of creating bluffing, deception, and intrigue with a thin fantasy theme.[/b]  Not really my cup of tea, but I'd play it every now and then.

Decent filler, not to be taken too seriously.  It's fun seeing people throw spells on a guy not knowing if they're healing or hurting him.  I recommend playing with 5 instead of 3 as it became obvious who was backing who usually.  There's be 2 creatures with no spells on them and maybe 1 creature with 1 spell.
Not amazing game, but for a filler, it's not bad, especially for the price.

The strategy in Cheaty Mages is subtle. There's a lot of luck involved in getting powerful cards or betting on the same fighters as another player, thereby unofficially teaming up to help one fighter win. However, there are enough decisions involved in bluffing with direct/enchant spells or suddenly changing the rules of the round that leave room for moments of strategy.

Another game that positively suprised me during play, as I feared for complete chaos and total randomness after reading the rules. But all three of us liked it quite a bit, even if we normally enjoy more serious (euro) games. The spell cards are really fun and diverse and cause quite some surprises during play. I am happy to have this game in my collection, even though I also own Colossal Arena (which feels sufficiently different from this crazy Japanese game).

RATING: 7
Cheaty Mages is rife with chaos and unpredictability. That said, I actually enjoyed the game tremendously because it did not overstay its welcome. Three rounds of game play with each round lasting 10 minutes or so. Players try to influence the outcome of an arena battle by supercharging or handicapping monsters in the arena with a variety of spell cards. A cool twist to the game comes in the form of judges sitting on the sidelines limiting the amount of spells cast on each monster per round.

This Kanai game share a similar mechanism with his other co-op design, Say Bye to Villians in that cards are played on the table either faced up or down. This face down cards introduce a random element of luck and chance since it is tough to predict if the cards can hurt or aid the monster.

10/2016: Yeah, this game is still ridiculous and the cards are silly and unpredictable. Still, there is a lot of fun to be had with the right crowd and right mix. Do not play this game with serious gamers that can't stomach large doses of luck, lack of control during card play because this game just won't sit well with them. For the rest of us casual gamers, show me the FIREBALL! Bump up ratings by 1.

RATING: 6
I see similarities with this game and Colossal Arena, though Colossal Arena probably has a lot more control over the game than Cheaty Mages does.  The face-down cards create a lot of uncertainty, but they do wind up making the "discard a card to see the face-down cards" option more valuable at the start of a round.  I like the way the mana interacts with the judge, and how the disallowed cards both force you to rethink your strategy, and give you options for which cards to discard.  I'd like to play it again to see how well it holds up over repeated plays.

The only similarity to Colossal Arena is the concept of betting on a creature to win the round (by having the highest power rating in the end).  The game itself is hardly original, and although it is highly unpredictable (or if you prefer, chaotic) due to most of the cards being played faced down, I didn't mind it too much.  It was actually fun trying to mislead the other people, even if it never worked.

The judges are kind of hit and miss.  Most of the fighters are just vanilla characters with no special ability.  A lot of times someone can get so far ahead on a lucky wager that there is really no way to catch up.  At least Cheaty Mages is quick enough to never overstay its welcome.

Suprisingly playable 30-minute filler. Five monsters or different strengths battle in an arena, players secretly select one they expect to win, and then in turn play spells on the monsters to increase or reduce their strength. Some spells are placed face down, some face up. Each round, there is a limit as to how much magic power can be played on each monster, if that's exceeded the monster is expelled or dispelled. Monster with highest total strength wins the battle, all players who bet on that one gets money, player with most money after 3 rounds wins. Interesting card combinations makes this little game really enjoyable.

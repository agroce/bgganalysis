Another in the "victory in the west" system and until "the killing ground" easily the most complicated. Lots of chrome with amphibious landings, paradrops & Italian collapse. Very long for a magazine game. As with all games in the system I enjoy but too long and a small bit fiddly.

Played. Nice, but I feel that discovering the true value of your troops at the first engagement was more realistic in other settings, earlier in the war... At least for the Axis. I agree with a reviewer: it is the Sicily with the most water that has ever been seen.

RATING: 6.5
I've never played this game through to completion. Its so much fun for the first  half of the game, but gradually grinds into a slugfest on a very narrow front (as happened historically!) which becomes less interesting to endure.

Victory in the West System stretched a bit to cover this campaign. A 300 counter magazine issue game. Nice map, with multiple terrain levels, one of Redmond's finest.

Bigger campaign than the original offerings in the series, so a bit more complex to cover initial amphibious invasion and naval aspects. Many of these rules have been incorporated to good effect in the forthcoming VCS Salerno game. 

If you are planning to play, well worth getting a copy of the designer notes and variants from Moves magazine #60.


Rating upped to a 9 now I can play this on vassal...it's intricate, it's fiddly, but it's a helluva game!

This game has an excellent system.
However, the situation makes it boring for the Axis player, who just need to check on the map the highest hills on the island situated on the road to Messina and sit tight....
Then good luck to the Allies with the dice rolls...
The designer should have allowed for more dynamism

Not a bad little game, but igo/hugo hex games ain't my favorites.  I had fun playing it, but my rating means that I probably won't get back to it any time soon.  What Sicily really needs is a good card-driven or area/impulse game...  :-)

RATING: 7
First S&T game for me - kind of sad considering what happened next.  Repurchased this recently, and I am impressed. It's a bit of a slog because of the situation, but is nicely put together with both sides given difficult problems. Bad weather in early turns can hold the Allies up quite badly... although that actually makes for a nice race game. It's almost inevitable that the Allies will clear the island in the allotted time, and at that point how many units the Axis managed to evacuate should have a big impact on who wins, except it doesn't because the only benefit of evacuation to the Axis is that it means the units aren't destroyed. A tweak to award VPs for evacuated units would probably make it more even. The other issue is that some early die rolls (Italian coastal defence) and the weather can dramatically affect how things go. Best go with historical weather on the first turn (Heavy Mistral) to slow the Allies down. Fantastic map - Simonsen at his finest. Only a pity he couldn't squeeze the CRT on there too!

This was the best of the old SPI VICTORY IN THE WEST series games.  Definitely a simulation of the battle, which tends to devolve into a slugfest in the mountains mid-to-end game.  One of the best S&T issue games of its era--and one of the last during the old SPI "golden age."

Good system and decent game, but degenerates into a slugfest on either side of Etna very early.  While this is, to be fair, historically EXACTLY what happened.....it does not make for a terribly exciting game.  Maybe I am being unfair.....after all, I guess the goal is to reproduce history, and this does.

RATING: 7
Old S&T magazine game.  Decent representation of Operation Husky with moderate number of counters.  Many people don't like the variable strength chit draw system with all the extra "fiddly" strength counters that are placed on top of the unit counters to give some degree of fog of war.

Great-looking game, peak of SPI graphics.  Another application of the fun VitW system, with far more special rules than the others in the "series".  The special rules and tight, rugged terrain make for a long game...plan on a very long day for the full thing.  Plays well with three.  Problems: highly variable Italian coastal forces and Allied paratrooper landings can require a mulligan; breakthrough CRT results end up transporting the Allies across vast amounts of difficult-to-traverse terrain (making an Axis defense there a bad idea!); the biggest drawback is that it's not much fun for the Axis player.  Would make for a terrific DG revision if they could be trusted to do anything right.

Best of Victory in  the West series. 300 counters and 8 pages of additional   rules make this an interesting look at the Sicily campaign.

Terrain plays a major part and those numerous small Italian units can make a difference in the rough Sicilian interior.

RATING: 9.5
Sicily, S&T #89 The Race for Messina is a slugfest for both sides. It simulates the lessons the Allied needed to learn in 1943, to succeed at Normandy, France the following year. The game has some mandatory rules that although painful to comply with, do force us to recreate the battle under much of the same conditions that the commanders faced. There is an alternate invasion plan that allows the Allies choices at their beachheads. Also many of the variable and optional units that could have taken part are available. Excels at teaching the lessons of terrain difficulties, seaborne landings, support for troops ashore in enemy territory and airborne problems. The Allies have a big job to make it to Messina in the same amount of time it took the real commanders. Works well with 3 players too.

Great little game. Like the part of not knowing the actual strength of either my own or my opponents units. Also a nice Map and counters. Maybe I am rating it a bit high because I like the beautiful island of Sicily so much but I think the game is a very good one. Recommended.

RATING: 5
Best (but most complicated) of the first 3 VitW series games S&T put out.  Game play is very smooth.  I'd say it moves quick, but the movement phase can really slow things down.  Several special rules also slow things down the first few times through.  Variable strength and Support Points make combat interesting and add to the 'commander's fear factor'.  Components (map, & counters) are nothing overly catchy, but very solid and work well together.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Like the system and the way it models uncertainty in the strength of your units.  But in the end it's large Allied units beating up on small and weaker Italian units with the odd German thrown in.

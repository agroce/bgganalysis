Decided to give this version fo Dice Masters a try because of its theme. Green Lantern ( Hal Jordan) is  my favorite character in DC ( or he used to be until DC ruined all their characters with "The New 52") and the storylines involving him and the other Lanterns are some of the best. But this game never got started. We just couldn't drag ourselves through it. Plus the rules are oddly written. They lay out how to play a demo game using only 2 characters each and some actions cards but never tell you how to set a standard game?

Another really solid set with some interesting cards and mechanics, my only disappointment is that it feels like we're just going to endlessly recycle characters that appear in multiple storylines, and I'm slowly learning that I'm just not a fan of the 'storyline' release pattern. Much cooler if they had just blown this thing up with a ton of the DC characters we'll never see. But for sure, this is a good looking one with clean dice designs.

Great set, a little more internal synergy that other sets but I love the new characters and powers. The War of Light was one of my favorite story arcs so I am probably biased.

This seemed like an odd choice for the second dice masters set in the DCU. I like the lanterns story line so I purchased it. I have to say this game does not come out to play often.

RATING: N/A
This is a fantastic game with clever game play.  It is fairly easy to grasp, and the choices in the game are quite involved.  My wife very much likes to play this game, which means quite a bit to me.  

However, the game is ugly.  One of the resources is represented by a green dot, while the corresponding resource disc is brown.  This is quite irritating.

RATING: 7
Played this for my first time ever in a Rainbow Draft with 7 other players. I enjoyed myself and thought it was a neat game. Probably not something I will seek out, but still cool never-the-less. And I definitely wouldn't turn down a game were someone to offer to play. Now I just need to get one of the starter sets so I can play whenever I want.

I like the bag building aspect as your buying dice to add to your bag and possibly pull to roll later. It had a deck building feel which is probably why I liked it so much

Same game as War of Light. I am currently collecting Avengers: Age of Ultron and DC's War of Light. They are the same game. I love the superhero theme. I absolutely love this game and am addicted to it. People erroneously call it a dice rolling fest, but it is not. It's a great game of managing calculated risks, much like American sports, particularly football. I would liken it to Poker mixed with an abstract strategy and/or tactical game. You have your team of guys and gals and go to battle, calculating odds of your opponent's success on his/her subsequent moves. And you weigh that calculation against your own odds of success with each decision you make. But you're always looking ahead to future turns, much like a game of chess, except there is a random component, like there is with Poker. So you make decisions based on your odds. That's risk management. Risk management relates to everything, including litigation. Yes, I am a trial lawyer so I really like the calculated risk taking about this game. 

Of course, my brother and I suck so far. But we are constantly discussing strategy. This game is not that hard to pick up, although confusing at first. But the strategy in it is deep, much like a game of football. The objective is simple, but there are pros and cons to every decision. 

The superhero theme just adds icing on the cake, as I love the color scheme of the dice that represent each individual hero. And I really like the art on the cards.

While I have a lot of characters and a decent amount of dice. I just don't have enough dice to play with standard tournament rules. I can play with those rules, but that would limit my options to fewer characters that I own. So to get the most out of my game, I play with 5 characters, 10 dice, and 20 points. I think strategy changes depending on the amount of dice to point ratio you have. The way we have it so far seems to work like a charm. I didn't want anyone to be able to successfully nickel and dime the whole game to a victory. That kind of strategy is too much luck based, in my opinion. I wanted more margin for error and required thought for well thought out and planned attacks to get those points down. I still might go to 15 points at some point. But for now, we do the full 20 with 10 dice and 5 characters. Even with the amount that I play  with, I have had a match were 19 points were taken in one player's turn to win the game. That game was THE game of Dice Masters games that I've had. The score was 19 to 2. And the winner took away 19 points to win the game in improbable fashion. It was actually quite unbelievable!

Update: Decided to move to 15 points with 10 dice. It's more balanced, I think.
Update: Moving back up to 20 points. More skill is required and there are other reasons. Playing with so much fewer than 20 dice makes it really hard to purchase high cost characters. Playing with 15 points makes it nearly impossible to buy them.

We are also going to start mixing in a few tournament rule games since we both have more than enough cards and dice for that. It's just that for a game like this, I want to be able to play with every last card I own if I wanted. And I am very into thematic teams, teams that fit together strategy wise, but not so much like what is done at the tournament or hardcore level. I love theme. I like the idea of being forced to use a pain in the a$$ character who just is not all that helpful in hopes of trying to see if you can work around that weakness. I think that part of the game is awesome! That being said, we are also going to start playing tournament rules with assembling teams for maximum effectiveness, too. We have never really played like that before because we didn't have enough dice per character to assemble a full team.

RATING: 7
From a play standpoint, this set might not be as good as the ones that come before it.  Unless you are talking about a draft format, then it might be even better.   The lantern colors are exclusive to this set, so mixing with the other sets doesn't yield good synergy.   Still, it's fun to collect and play.  Great artwork, bad production quality, as is expected from WizKids.

Better than Quarriors, but not in any actually interesting way.  The dynamics of how the dice work and life points works better, but it isn't better enough to assume it's a better game.

RATING: 9.5
A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

RATING: 2
The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I like this one slightly more than the Age of Ultron set if only because Green Lantern is my favorite superhero and I honestly prefer DC to Marvel in general. Minus Ms. Marvel. She's awesome. But yeah. Easy game, super fun. I enjoy playing with my brothers very much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Continuation of the collectable dice game -- but, like all Lantern-based sets, there is a heavy reliance on different Lanterns who should all basically do the same thing. The ultra rare are all Lantern variants of the League members, just to make it more desirable.

PLUS: more characters
MINUS: Lanterns are boring

Rating is for all Dice Masters games and not this version specifically. Its a fun game with nice artwork, but its randomness on randomness. The bag draw is random as well as the dice roll. Sure you have means of mitigation for both those elements but for me the game is too dependent on elements out of my control. Update: I have played and enjoyed other versions of Dice Masters, so maybe I just not enjoy this set specifically.

Great game that is hampered by its collectible nature and requirement to keep up with the relentless release schedule. Those factors made me give up on it.

PROS
- Great licensing here allowing you to play DC vs Marvel vs TMNT vs etc.
- overall the dice are very cool.
- quick playing with a small footprint.
- really good fan-made solo variant.
- "Dice building" mechanic twist on "deck building"
- There is some depth to the game if you get serious about it by collecting the "good" cards and/or looking for good combinations.
- Two good, serious players going head to head can be quite the cerebral battle as both attempt to setup combos and defensive counters.

CONS
- collectible nature of the game with tiered cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc) means that it's not a level playing field like a LCG. Some people have cards others didn't get access too or weren't willing to buy in the secondary market.
- Wizkids quality control.
- Wizkids release schedule.
- The game doesn't promote characters as much as just random individual cards... so if you want to play Superman and Spiderman just for fun, their cards could potentially be terrible whereas Cheetah or Aunt May could be amazing cards.
- It's hard to play the game casually because then you miss the depth of the serious game. It can just become a random grind or very unbalanced because of the cards drafted or chosen for fun.
- Related to the above, there isn't any support for the casual player with for example recommended starting teams.
- Overall, not worth the price of keeping up with the game, hunting down cards, list building vs the overall gameplay experience.

Dice Masters is a MTG type deck building game that uses dice. You build a team of 8 characters, and by rolling for "energy" you can add better dice to your pool. The game incorporates MTG style rules (my fav. game) with deck building mechanics (another fav).

The second DC themed expansion for Dice Masters is once again a solid addition to the collection. The biggest pro and con to this set is how much the cards reference and interact with each other, while this makes it probably the best set for drafting in tournaments it does make the cards seem less useful when combined with all the other sets.

I've done a previous review of Dice Masters, so will only review this as a set.

It does have some good mechanics, but there is way too much internal synergy for my liking. Some cards simply don't work at all without using other cards from the same set. This really limits the replayability and interaction with different sets. All the "Lanterns" that combo off each other, even on other sides of the field, is kind of annoying to me - as I don't follow DC and didn't know the symbols at all. I much prefer the simplicity of other sets, where the symbol at the top of the card is all you need to see - it makes it much easier to explain to newer players.

Overall, I don't really like it and don't see myself playing this set much.

8/2/2016
After myself and Julia purchased a new Gravity Box and tried a few draft matches, I've came around to thinking this isn't as bad as I first thought.
While it still isn't a go-to set for me (like D&D), I'm not against playing a draft setting with this one from time to time. Some of the cards even seem worthwhile to play outside of the set!

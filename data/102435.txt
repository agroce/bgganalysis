I have only played the walkthrough which is pretty extensive and will take several hours to complete. The game is a bit of a head scratcher at the beginning as it is not obvious which option is the right option on each stage, however in the end I ended up doing whatever sounded more exciting when in doubt and enjoyed living through the journey of the Navajo people. After the walkthrough I continued the game to completion and it was very satisfactory even though it took very long. This game is absolutely beautiful from a component perspective and it feels like a labour of love for its designer. It has strong elements of civilisation building to satisfy euro players too but it primarily has a very strong flavour of war and fighting is sometimes the best and fastest way to strengthen and advance your tribe. However you could build quite a lot too without being always on the attack.

After four plays (all with the basic scenario, so I really should try the longer ones), this is a game I like conceptually and thematically, but it still takes a long time to wrap your head around what you should be doing strategically. It's a game that tells a story, but also a game you are supposed to try to win, and sometimes the former comes at the expense of the latter. I like breaking it out and setting out all those beautiful components to experience the story of the Dine, but as a game, I just can't love it as much as I'd like.

Seems to owe some influence to state of siege games. The tutorial is good - given the rulebook is not intuitive. However I didn't find it very thematic (as I don't most state of siege games). However unlike state of siege game play is very unclear ie how you influence what is going on and the margins of winning and losing are very close making victory somewhat random and very dependant on card order. At least in states of siege there is some purpose to strategy!

A great game that provoked a deeper interest in learning about the Navajos and the associated history of the American Westward expansion. There is tons of depth in this one.  It will require many plays to appreciate the interplay of actions and to develop effective strategies.

RATING: 5
A little too procedural. They say that you only start feeling the game dynamics after a couple of matches.
Let's see. So far, not very impressive.

Also, I didn't like the options of possible actions with the families. It seemed that all you do is raid and run, raid and run.

But seeing all the positive reviews, some of these from people whose judgement I respect, I'm inclined to believe I didn't "get it".

It has taken me a number of games to get the mechanics of this game down to the point where I can experience it and think about it from a thematic point of view. What is really remarkable about this is that, I believe, thinking about the puzzle of the scenarios requires considering the historical context and theme. This is a tremendous design feat, in my opinion. I find myself setting up the game, establishing a strategic plan gleaned from where I went wrong in my previous defeat only to discover that I get swept up in managing the unrelenting calamities beset on my families, lose sight of my plan, and ultimately lose outright...then I set it up again. 

My only complaint is that an auto victory is very anti-climactic for the hard work that goes into achieving the game state conditions that it requires.

RATING: 10
This is an incredibly unique game, one that simulates something that few (aside from Phil Eklund and a couple much older paper games) have tried to simulate: the rise and fall of a culture. It has some aspects of a war game, but is not a war game. It has a few similarities to a Civ builder, but is not one of those either. In essence, you are the gatekeeper of Navajo civilization, and you are trying to hold the line against outside encroachment. Because what it simulates is a bit unusual, the mechanisms are very unique and fresh, to the point that it does take multiple plays before you really understand what is going on and have a clue as to what "good play" might be. Once you get the hang of it, though, this is one of those rare games that will teach you something about a topic that is unfamiliar to most of us, and do so through play, not exposition. Even if you don't like solo games or the theme, I'd highly recommend this because it is incredibly fresh, with mechanisms you'll see nowhere else. Outstanding.

There is a good game in here somewhere, but this one isn't quite it. It's the usual thing - an incredibly sprawling game that spends too much screwing with bookkeeping and levers that don't really do anything, and not enough focus on real player engagement. In an attempt  to cover all the major elements of Navajo history, Navajo Wars lacks thematic energy and ends up not covering anything in any compelling way. From a gameplay perspective, too many decisions are uninformed guesses (you can be royally screwed by the card flow for no good reason) or non-choices (because you have to take action X because enemy activity Y is coming down the pike and will run you over). The weird dichotomy between operations, planning, and time passing serves to unduly constrain player choice and take one out of the simulation (as long as there is food, presumably the Navajo are going to go ahead and have kids even if leadership doesn't do a planning operation?). Anyway, a lot of pieces to like here, but they just aren't put together in a very coherent fashion. GMT really needs to work on their cadre of developers. Some of them are good, but too many of their games feel like almost no development work was done.

Wow, an incredibly impressive game sitting on a too often ignored time period. And I would love this game as an Android App (gladly paying, I don't know, 20 for it, which is more than any other app I've ever bought) because it would handle the too complicated for me rules (I don't like referring to the rules more than once or twice the first time I play, and not at all subsequently) and all the moving chits, which take up too much time for my taste.

*6* (Initial plays)
I ran through the first scenario and really couldn't get into this, so keep in mind these are preliminary thoughts. It felt overly complicated and tedious with a long setup. I was exhausted after the setup and rounds to even finish the game. A game that requires a good amount of consistent playing and time, but the game is beautiful with enriched art and components, and the game happens to be deep in theme and history.

I am not usually a solitaire player, but this theme and narrative perspective really pulls me in. Learning the system takes some doing, but I found that I was able to arrive at a full understanding of the mechanics after only a couple of hours. The strategy is another question entirely, however. It is a very difficult game to win.

RATING: 7
Card-driven, heavy (but less complex than COINs) solo game, with a unique historical theme. The game is interesting and engaging, and sports some truly innovative mechanisms, namely the programmed opponent chit rondell and raids.  I loved my plays of the game, but do not feel this is something I will pull often out to play, which considering that it is not an easy game to pick up after 6mo, makes me think I want to let go of it. Also, the cards are shared between all the scenarios, have duplicates and feel generic, and some cultural events seem stronger (must have) than others. But mostly, what turned me off a bit was the sheer randomness of the roll of the die, that can destroy the fragile VP fight between enemy morale and military  just because you rolled a couple of 1s and lost the fights. A d6 for such purposes is a big randomness pot, and this should have been mitigated. Granted, somebody might say that war is war, but this is not a war game, this is mostly a euro game. And I don't fancy losing such a long (5h or so) euro session based on a couple of rolls. There is strategy and tactical puzzling out, of course, but luck seems a bit too strong a factor for me. Still, a solid design with sparkles of brilliance. Thoroughly enjoyable.

+ couple of great innovative mechanisms
+ strong unique theme, treated with much respect
+ an engaging and tactically and strategically rewarding solo game
+ great components and art

= a tough game to understand and play well, and one that needs to be re-learned every 6mo

- replayability (not input variability!) of the scenarios seems low base on the same card deck
- too much luck that can ruin a long, tremendously fun experience
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a non trivial solo challenge and so far I have won it once.  

My take on this game is that you need to take a few chances at the beginning and get ahead of the curve.  If the risk taking does not pan out the game AI is quite efficient at beating you.  However once you have got a small advantage you can start to play more conservatively and try to plan for the nastier events that are hiding in the deck.

At first you feel like you have only a little agency and are subject to what appears to be unpredictability and chaos.  Simply playing the next card for maximum effect would give this impression.

To win you will have to:
Make and adapt a plan
Keep track of when the scoring cards are due
Have a mental picture of the contents of the cube bag
Make predictions about the AI
Mitigate against risk
Know when to be bold
Start manipulating the AI and the cube bag to your advantage

You may have only three ways to take a turn but the decissions are non trivial.  This perhaps the best solo game I own with a lot of hidden depth.

Just never 'got it'-seemed as if I were just a human compiler-move this, increment that. Long, confusing circuitous flow charts for many of the moves-and that "awesome AI" that everyone seems to rave about? Its two columns of chits with an A action on one side and a B action on the other and sometimes you swap the columns and sometimes you don't, sometimes you flip a chit, sometimes you don't-the chits (human compiler again) move up the 'stack', and when at top you 'pop the stack'- but I never had any sense that the movement was really in response to the game so much as just a random instruction to do this or that....the odd map layout probably needs to be given credit as it is unique and nice to look at-but in the end-very glad to have gotten this albatross off of my shelf.

After playing the first two scenarios, I think I'm ready to call this one a masterpiece of solitaire design. No, I know I am. The rating stands at a 9 for now but has serious 10 potential; I just want to play the full game first or at least another scenario that uses rules I haven't encountered yet (e.g., Forts). 

When I try to vet the game, I wasn't sure where the fun was. While the board is pretty to look at with the stones and all, I wasn't sure what kind of game I was looking at -- didn't look like a wargame yet I didn't think it was a euro, what with it coming from GMT and having a bunch of chits. I guess I'd describe it as a unique strategy game, perhaps a "weuro" since there are tactical battle considerations as well as resource management. 

The fun comes in using your three main operating categories -- 1) take actions, 2) plan, 3) passage of time -- in light of what the Enemy Instruction Display is showing as his (probably but not definite) upcoming actions. The EID is a brilliantly elegant mechanism for rendering a sophisticated AI that is viscerally understood by the player. 

In addition to being a game I love, this game turned me on to the designers other projects (Comancheria) and the genre of heavy solitaire gaming in general. A watershed game for me.

RATING: 8
You don't simply pick up and play Navajo Wars. The expression "a steep learningcurve" is well deserved in this case. Not because the rules are hard to understand but rather because it is hard to get a grip of the overall gameflow. I can recommend designer Joel Toppen's video tutorial. Great way to get a feel for the game.

So, do I like the game?

Very much so, but I suspect it's not everyones cup of tea.

RATING: 10
This may be bias on my part as a newbie to historical games, but I found Navajo Wars to be stunning and unique.

I've always appreciated games that encourage me to research external sources to more fully understand the material and mechanics, but I've mostly only experienced this in video games (like Kerbal Space Program or Crusader Kings). Seeing this happen with a board game was revelatory for me.

It took a tutorial playthrough and an intro playthrough to come to terms with all of the procedural mechanics and to begin to see through them and start to understand the underlying stories that are told, but once that started to happen my investment in the game deepened further.

This game's modeling of the different time periods in the history of the Diné is nuanced, respectfully honest, and engrossing in a way that reaches beyond the game itself and can often make a session that I lost feel just as compelling as getting a "win" condition.

Beyond an eye-opening experience of Navajo history, I also feel like this game has inaugurated my interest in more historical games in this vein: not necessarily wargames that pit armies in conflagrations on a battlefield but models of complex conflicts that go beyond military operations and encourage the player to inhabit motivations and points of view that might be foreign and sometimes unnerving or heartbreaking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fantastic theme/gameplay mix.  This is the best solitaire game I've played so far.

One play of the introductory scenario Rise of the People.  Ended in a Minor Defeat (Culture - Morale = 0).  

Once you've spent a bit of time reading through the rules and playing through the tutorial, there's very little reason to open up the rulebook again.  Other than the charts for the Battles, you'll only have a few instances where you'll need to check out a rule.  Not as daunting as I first expected.

After my second play, I can't help but give it a 10 rating.  It feels so perfectly designed.  

Third play: Spanish scenario again - automatic defeat at 26th of 45 cards.  I'm really starting to understand how thematically what I need to do and how to achieve it.  Actually doing it is another.  The Outposts took my Culture points down very quickly with a couple of Expand actions in a row.  A half dozen cards before I lost, I thought I was totally in control, but things changed quickly when I stopped being aggressive.  Seemingly failing every Elder action/death roll didn't help either!

I still can't beat the Spanish scenario.  I've come close, usually losing in a Minor Defeat, but you can't lose focus on Morale at all.  Knowing when a Victory check is coming is important.  I have to remember to count the cards in the discard pile periodically to be prepared.  Six games in, and the game only gets better.

Beautiful, beautiful middle-heavyweight solitaire gem. Disregard those negative comments for the errata (everything can be fixed with a few minutes confrontation with the errata on GMT site). Different scenarios allows huge replayability and AI is smooth and clever.

The game is easy to learn thanks to an excellent playbook/rules of play learning system but really hard to play.

Not putting a 9 according to BGG ratings as I would never want to play all the times a game this complex.

Kudos to Joel and Steve for coming up with a very original system on an ignored place and period.  The components are generally quite nice, though the board takes a little getting used to.

Have now logged a couple games with the intro scenario, including a win.  I am growing to really appreciate the innovative and rich system that delivers a lot of variety in game-play with a minimum of fiddlyness.  Lots of tough decisions, and thinking through situations.  Makes for engaging play.

Really like the designer's notes.  Makes we want to read up on the Native Americans in the Southwest as they were overwhelmed by the Euro-Americans.  Very interested in learning more about the pre-existing civilizations there.

Finished the tutorial - all I can say is wow.  It's a tough slug to wrap your head around the system and process of the game at first - but by the end, regardless of chat referencing and rules look-ups, the narrative that is told is a truly amazing thing to experience.  

My guess, as I play more, is that this game will show its true strength as a story-telling game: rich in history and compelling in its projection of a narrative of a people that should not be forgotten.  I felt the angst of caring for and preserving my families and culture amidst an enemy AI that is handled cleverly and given a sense of spontaneity.

In fact i loathe solitaires by now.. so even though i'd never play this again in my life i leave it at 4 because it was the best & most thematic solitaire i've ever played.

__________________
Incredibly good game.
It's just that i don't enjoy solitaires that much anymore.

The artwork & historic feel of the game is outstanding! The fact that you're trying to avoid fighting most of the time is a very refreshing change to the usual "beat everything to pulp" in other wargames.
That along with the ardous task of feeding all your people conveys the feeling of being under constant threat & the need to lure those settlers into traps and fruitless depleting campaigns while grabbing all the livestock you can get your hands on.

The map is not only a piece of art but has a very good usability. The historical notes are combined with the pivotal event cards did teach me a lot of navajo history.

Also kudos to Joel (the designer) not to shy away from depicting an american period that saw continous injustice against the native americans. Something you don't see in american game designs very often.

*Have only played the Spanish Era Scenarios*

Good options for the player to pursue different strategies which will develop the board in different ways. This means that the player will be thinking strategically rather than just comparing odds. The game is tough though so I think there is a need to find and stick to certain efficient strategies to win, but figuring out what they are seems to take time. Certain elements of it's design, mainly abstractness and the convolution of multiple systems, make it sometimes feel more like a puzzle than an experience. It has elements of pushing one's luck and always needing to be one step ahead. Some people like this concept of "tension". I actually find it stressful. Still it is a unique design and topic, which is well crafted and gives one much to ponder.

Changed the rating from 9 to 5 and what i mean is that its an awesome solo gameplay experience but for me the theme is a killer, i just don't like it and I have plenty other solo games that are waiting to hit the table and this is the only reason that Navajo Wars ended to the [i]"take it or leave it"[/i] category, for me its over, i will never come back to it...

=======================================================
ok, so I finally put it on the table and I was determined to play it! The GOLDEN RULE is to play the tutorial at the PLAY BOOK and watch 2 video walkthrough's and thats it! Ok, I enjoy it, it looks very solid and it is, its not that difficult after all but rather medium difficult, its not a 100% wargame either, more like civilization game I would say. Its a mix of the State of Siege system (point to point movement, organize the play deck, limited reactions), absolutely card driven, a bit of mathematics (calculate the enemies future action points/reactions etc), a bit of luck (dice rolls) and a vision of your tribes destiny! Overall a magnificent solo gameplay experience that every solo gamer must try it outhtere and deserves a [b]9[/b] but I would love to see this kind of successful mechanism to a medieval themed game because as I said indian history isn't attractive to me at all. (November 2016)
===========================================================
ok, i have decided to give it one more chance, bought it again... Game added (back) at my collection: July 2015, 
although that every time I try and watch a gameplay video I'm bored to tears...
=========================================================
I've sat down in front of this about 3 times now, and each time it bounces off my head and I can't get started. 
Update: The game as usual left my collection unplayed, dont know, although i am a solo player the indian history didnt click my enchephalus...

I thought that I hated "war games". But goodness is this game amazing. The story in this game is thorough and immersive. It is challenging, but rewarding. While the mechanics are detailed and nuanced, they also have a narrative flow that makes sense. I have had very little trouble with them now that I know them well. With that said, there is a fair amount of fiddly-ness. It is well worth it, though.

The learning curve is high; but you should invest the time. You will learn a lot and have a lot of fun.

However, the book tutorial and the online tutorial ease the gamer into the game.  I have played 4 games so far in the same scenario and finally had a major victory.  Each game has played differently, even with the same scenario.  Great game!

It has arrived.  Wow, one of the best covers n a game I have ever seen.  Looks to be quite unique among the solo games in its manner of play.  Very excited to get it to the table after such a long wait.

My geekbuddies were not wrong.  Unique game.  Have so far played the learnign scenario but I can see the choices involved and the flow of the game and it looks to create a very compeeling story.  A bit tough to follow the rules alone, but the playbook is superb.  Cannot wait to try again.

July '15: got it down again to relearn.  Managed a slight win in the basic scenario.  Excellent game... Will need to bring it down before I forget how to play and try a tougher scenario.

[u]17-May-2016[/u]:  Navajo Wars is an excellent, historic, thinky, and long-playing solitaire game. The player takes control of the Diné (or Navajo people) through many years of their history, from the Spanish Period of the late 1500s through the American Civil War in the 1860s. The best way for me to describe it briefly is an advanced States of Siege style game. There are several tracks on the map with a “central” location (it’s actually on the right side), but the player occupies and defends, so to speak, all tracks as the Enemy comes from the single location, Santa Fe, New Mexico…rather than the reverse as in a typical SoS game. There is a deck of cards which determines the number of actions the Enemy will take, as well any events that may occur throughout the course of play. It is up to the player to manage several Navajo families as they grow crops, raise animals, deal with drought, nurture their culture and traditions, and of course defend themselves from the Enemy encroaching on their land, their history, and their wellbeing.

The components supplied by GMT are excellent quality. The game board is quite stunning with its use of colored stones to represent point-to-point areas of movement. There are several nice touches, including authentic looking “bowls” to store the various cubes and chits on the board. I think the board could use some slight alterations as the main space for the current event card is a little far away from the player. And there wasn’t quite enough room along the top of the board to store all of the Cultural Development cards you have in play during the last scenario, when you have the most available to you. But these are minor issues. The counters are standard, good quality GMT fare. Cardstock is nice, although a little stiff for shuffling…but there isn’t much of that needed anyway. My least favorite part of the game though, is the player aids. These are essential for the player and will be used constantly. The main one is a three-page pamphlet that opens wide. It is unwieldy and inconvenient. Thankfully, I found a set of player aids on BGG that work excellent for my needs and only require the use of the GMT supplied ones for certain situations.

As for the gameplay, it can feel somewhat long and repetitive as you are basically doing the same handful of actions from turn to turn. And I feel this way about the States of Siege games as well. What keeps it from becoming a slog though, is the way the games presents the narrative and history of the Diné as you progress.  It doesn’t tell you the history of the Navajo people, it shows it to you. You witness it play out in front of you. You participate in the narrative that evolves over the course of the scenario you are playing. 

The main engine of the game is the AI action matrix. It’s a thing of beauty for us solo gamers. It’s thematic. It’s predictable and yet constantly changing, offering a different set of actions from turn to turn for the Enemy. And it’s very easy to implement, while offering a complex set of results for the Enemy to perform. There are three sets of counters available representing the Spanish, Mexican, and American time periods, and each one has a different “feel” to it. This action matrix is the heart of the AI and will keep the player on his toes and always needing to adjust his strategy accordingly. It’s an excellent system that I hope to see more of in future games of all types.

Navajo Wars is challenging, interesting, and full of historical narrative. It’s also long and mentally draining. I can’t honestly say when, or even if, I’ll take this back down from the game shelf. There are many games in my collection (like many of us), and it isn’t always easy to make that kind of commitment to a big game such as this one. But I do like having this one as that option. I’m definitely curious to see how the next game in the series updates and changes the basic system of play, Comanchería. I don’t know that I’ll get it any time soon as Navajo Wars seems to fill that itch for me for now. But I’m happy to see the series continue. And as I stated earlier, I’d love to see this type of AI engine be implemented for other games. For now, Navajo Wars is going back on the shelf, but I’m really glad to have put the effort into learning and experiencing all that’s in the box.

Navajo Wars is unlike almost anything else in my collection and is certainly one of the best solo games I own. While the game is extremely procedural, and I don't find that that detracts from the stories it tends to tell. My only complaints are that the strategy is extremely opaque (I still have never achieved more than a "marginal victory") and that it takes some work to get back into the rules after not playing for some time.

The best solitaire game IMHO.

Extremely thematic.  

The game can be procedural at time but all the procedures are aligned with thematic elements.

The AI is smart and highly innovative.  

Contains ground-breaking mechanisms in the area of solitaire gaming (AI, Resource procurement (raids on New Mexico mechanism), .   

Going through the play book tutorial once or twice will be necessary to get the flow of the game.

Going through the procedures can be considerably sped up by using the player aids available from the Geek.  

Also do not forget to use the official errata.

Rules are written well but could have been written in a way that would reduce the amount of cross-referencing that is required.  This can be mitigated with available player aids.

It will stay on your gaming table for months!

Too much is decided by the order of the cards, and this makes the game too random for me. If you're unlucky, you have no chance of winning.

This one gives me a good puzzle, but it is stacked against you, and the game is too often decided by luck.

RATING: 8
rich in rules
poor in choices
(like virgin queen)
would have preferred the opposite !

(while not really " complicated "
the game requires constant reference
to the player aids (very well done) so
it moves at a rather slow pace & more
annoyingly, you'll soon discover that
your choices are few
(if a raid is possible (on new mexico
or an outpost) you will probably do it
& take option A (" take actions ") /
if no raid is possible, you will
make a planning (option B) / if
you've got a new family ready,
you will take the " passage
of time " way (option C)

so, on your turn, you will have only
3 ways to go & most of the time, 
best one will be obvious

(A.I. follows the same track, looking
impressive with 8 or 9 different counters
but, in the end, offering only 3 main actions
for the enemy : subjugate / make a raid / 
add outposts

this being said, I've got an immense respect
for Joel Toppen & I don't see how he could have
made the game better (the game also suffers from
the Geronimo (Berg game) syndrom : as a player
you would like to see the indians attack, & fight,
& win, but in the game, like in the real life,
they mostly had to defend, protect & flee

Rating pending. It probably will go up, as I'm really excited about it. It tells such a great story. The rules are not easy and there's a lot of nuances that just slip from mind when playing. But now with 4,5 games under my belt I'm starting think about less and less about rules and more and more about what to do and how to do it. Most excellent game.

Excellently designed solo game with some very unique AI in it. The rules are a bit of a bear to get through though and I found myself constantly referencing both the rule book and the aid sheets. It is an engaging simulation / puzzle to run through but I don't really have that much fun playing it.

[b]Rating History[/b]
• Original Rating: 8 on May 01, 2015 after 3 plays
• Revised down to a 6 on June 14, 2016 after 4 plays. The game is very well designed and the AI is excellent but I just don't have much fun playing it. It is too much of a constant beat-down and too much referencing of rules. It was my first "complex" solo game and I think my original rating was influenced by that initial wow-factor of discovering these types of games. I prefer others in my collection now.

Surprise of 2013 for me. I love big solo games that I can leave up for an extended period of time and nibble at slowly over the course of weeks and even months. Pickings are pretty slim in that family of game, but Navajo Wars is fantastic. 

Player has many,many decision points, all of which are meaningful. The strategies needed to win are subtle. You can easily spend 5-10 minutes thinking about your next move, almost as if were a game of chess. Good variation. Player needs to be flexible. Tactics which work wonderfully in one game may fail miserably in the next. Not too random - player always feels like he is in control in spite of all the dice rolling and chit pulling.

My first play of this took almost 6 hours with the tutorial as well as clipping the counters. I found the game to be okay, but a lot to wrap my head around. After my second play using the same scenario, I have to say the system, while still busy, isn't as difficult as I had initially felt.

The game plays relatively quick once you start to get into the game (although I feel like your first 3-5 games are going to be glued to the rulebook). The flavor is there, but it felt a little light with the OP cards. It almost felt like filler until you got to a scoring card.

I really liked how the enemy behaves, it's both fast and simple, without looking up too much. I also would have preferred the player aid to be split into single pages since the 3 page one is a pain in the ass to use.

Overall, a game which has me thinking about when I'm not playing it. I feel like the rating is either going to rise or drop a point depending on how the next couple scenarios go.

Really excellent game, quite beautiful too.  This is my first true solo gaming experience, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  I've thought that I may as well be playing a video game (but I'm not really interested in playing video games, and I don't think there's many video games that I'd find as interesting as NW).  I really enjoy soloing multiplayer games in order to learn the rules and explore the game interactions, but this game feels different.  I'm also still new at it, and there's a lot to internalize, so with another play or two things should progress more smoothly (game mechanics-wise).

The game provides an excellent abstraction of a very one sided conflict.  Your Navajo families are (hopefully) riding out a tsunami of invasion, both culturally and militarily.  The tokens representing the man, woman, and child for each family make me feel more personally invested in their well being... it's hard for me to commit to any action that risks losing a family member, even when it's clearly in my best interest.  The theme is gripping and interesting, and that's with frequent rulebook double-checks and flow-chart following (it's not as bad as that last bit makes it seem, I promise).

Lastly, the rulebook is excellent and the example tutorial playthrough was very welcome.

With the BGG scale it's a 7, but that more reflects my desire to play a solo game than it does the game itself.

Interesting topic that is well represented here. Given the breadth of the game (centuries pass), I love that it still includes horses, sheep, corn, elders, firearms, etc. The historical periods are well differentiated. AI doesn't react but sets the agenda, which is historically correct and also makes for a smarter AI. Lots of paths to take, lots of decisions.

Possible drawbacks? Procedural as f*** all. A bit heavy on errata, possibly the consequence of trying to be too helpful to the player. Certainly some luck is involved in game play, which is fine with me. But I think you can shuffle a "bad deck" (e.g., Pueblo Revolt is the first card).

Thematic materials often cash in for things like re-rolls, deck re-arrangement, etc. This is also the sort of game where you may find yourself counting to see exactly how far a raid will go, or peeking ahead to see the major event. These aren't necessarily flaws, but aren't the stuff everyone likes. Perhaps they take you out of the story a bit.

This is an extraordinary design. It's certainly not for everyone - the rules overhead is large, each game took around 5 hours, there's a lot of dice-rolling, and well, it's solo. But if you think you could cope with those things, I'd really recommend the experience. I love that you don't play the conquering heroes like so many games; you play the losers, gradually getting run over by an unstoppable force, and just trying to maintain some dignity.

Surprisingly easy to get started on playing this one, given the complexity of the game. Not too difficult to figure out the rules for how to do a number of things. The tricky part is in figuring out how to reach a certain result - which things do you have to do along the way in order to try and get to that result. 
Nice with a game that isn't on the side of the 'white conquerors' as so many other games seem to be, but actually view things from the side of the people who used to inhabit the space. Also very nice that the land seems to play such a big role.

You can't just read through the rule book and start playing.  You have to go through the tutorial all the way, but it is a very rewarding game!

Brilliant. Brilliant. Brilliant.

I wasn't sure if I'd rate another game 10 but Navajo Wars just gets better and better. It is tense from start to finish, the decisions matter, bookkeeping is minimal and it generates narrative. It is such a clever design and such a great playing experience. The whole thing is enhanced by really beautiful production values making this game a total joy to play.

And...back down to a 9. Its still a great game but a few unsatisfying games leave me thinking that some of the rules (auto-victory and the transitions in the campaign) aren't quite right. It's a diamond that isn't quite cut right.

(reprinted from my review at www.armchairgeneral.com)

Navajo Wars is a new release from GMT with an unusual focus. As the game’s designer, Joel Toppen, states in the extensive designer’s notes included in the game, he lived amongst the Navajo for most of his life and his interest in their culture propelled him to design a game based upon the Navajo experience.
 
“I started to make a conscious effort to look at things through the eyes of the Navajo . . . I began to see just what a valiant and epic struggle took place in the land I walk across every day! As a gamer, I also saw potential for a conflict simulation,” Toppen writes. Navajo Wars meets and exceeds that potential.
Navajo Wars is a complex solitaire or two-player simulation of the struggles of the Dine (Navajo; it is pronounced “dih-nay”) people from the Spanish incursion in 1598, through the Mexican invasion and continuing until the Dine’s ultimate subjugation by the American Army in 1864. It encompasses not only military actions but also cultural, religious, farming and trade goods and all other aspects of a macro view of Dine life during these time periods. As such, it becomes a complete simulation of a way of life but, as to be expected in a game of such scope, it is difficult to learn and master.

Navajo Wars features a stunningly attractive design; the 22 x 33-inch mounted map is a work of art. While many wargames try to make their maps realistic, Toppen has gone for a representation of Navajo Territory including parts of New Mexico, Utah and Arizona as the Dine would have drawn it hundreds of years ago. The land is broken into seven distinct territories and within each territory are areas that are rated by foot and horse movement rates. The deeper that the territory goes, the more difficult the region is for outsiders to navigate, and the easier it is for the Dine to either ambush or lose any forces following them. Unfortunately, the deeper and more remote the area is, the harder it is to farm. Paths connect all the areas and territories.

Each of the areas is represented on the map by a different color stone for ease of differentiating between them. Other parts of the map are used to track events, culture and military points, place resources, track families and their possessions, track Dine elders, and track enemy forces as well. The game mechanics that control the actions of enemy tribes as well as the foreign invaders (the Spanish, Mexicans or Americans depending on the time period) is based upon a unique S-shaped matrix on which order chits move, flip over or trade places depending upon different events. When the enemy of the Dine has enough action points to activate one of the chits, the current action is initiated. These actions include a raid to take slaves, major attacks into Dine territory, enemy Indians who have been subverted to help the foreigners, calling a general outbreak of “peace”—these are but a few examples of possible actions. The entire design motive is based around spirals and circles, much befitting traditional Navajo design motifs.

The game comes with different color cubes and a bag to put them in. These cubes are drawn from the bag during combat actions and the results cross-referenced on one of several tables depending on the type of combat. Types of combats can include Dine raids on outposts or forts, raids into Santa Fe and combats against either foreigners or other Indian tribes.

Also included are three colorful dice, operations cards, cultural development cards, ceremony cards, historical event cards and transitional event cards. Counters are also included and the production value is equally beautiful on these as well.
Each scenario tells the player what cards, counters and number of cubes to use.
Each player is given a specific number of families, which make up the tribe. Each family is made up of 1 man counter, 1 woman counter and 1 child counter. During specific situations, a family may lose one of the counters, and it is then imperative for the player to try and complete the family again. Men add ferocity and combat ability to the family unit, women can use specific skills to generate trade goods, and children ensure the future of the family. Each family is also rated for its skill at evasion and its ferocity. Additionally, if the family has possession of horses, its ability to move is increased. If a family has horses, it can raid deeper into enemy territory.

Additionally, the tribes have elders that give them specific abilities including increasing or decreasing the ferocity of a family, giving the player more action points, etc. But be aware that as the years go by elders get more powerful and wiser, but the increase in years brings the elder close to death.
Each turn is made up of the following: draw a card from the deck (this could be an operations card, historical event or a ceremony), resolve the card instructions (there several things to do on each card) and follow through with events, check to see if either side can call a victory and then discard cards. When resolving the card instructions, a player can try and prevent an enemy from performing an action, move families through the areas and territories, plant corn, attempt ceremonies, try and reverse the effects of drought, have elders help with planning, raid the enemy forces, attempt diplomacy with other tribes, attack other tribes, follow up on reports of traders and hunters trespassing on your land, etc. There are so many things a player can do that it makes learning the game somewhat daunting.
It is this open-ended nature that requires a huge ramping up to learn the rules and play. The Rule Book states not to attempt to memorize the rules but to play through the tutorial in the Play Book. Even so, it takes a goodly number of hours before the player can understand the complex system of Navajo Wars.

 While learning the game, I combined a read-through of the Rule and Play Books with several hours of on-line YouTube courses taught by Toppen, himself (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJsuGzDmesY). After about three hours, I felt comfortable enough with the rules to try a new game without training wheels, but I still made mistakes.

A third book should have been included that would give an outline of setting up the game, followed by a detailed look at what can be done for each turn. This would have cut down the ramp-up time dramatically.

Additionally, the Rule Book needs an index for ease of use. Plus, there were several errors in the Play Book tutorial, which could have added to the confusion of learning the game, had I not watched the YouTube training videos.

With all the components in Navajo Wars, I wish the box had been designed to be at least ½” deeper. As it is, the box lid doesn’t sit deep enough to make me feel comfortable that it won’t come open.

There are many things to be aware of while trying to guide your people to victory: The more population that you have the better, but, you have to make sure you have enough food (corn and sheep) in order to avoid starvation. Don’t group your population too close to each other as they will be adversely affected by starvation, disease or enemy attacks in force. It is important to keep you culture points high but also to balance these with military points. If your culture and military points drop to zero, your people have been conquered.

Peace is wonderful but as it goes on, your enemies will try and expand their reach into your territory. At some point, if you want a strong culture, you have to push the foreigners back into their land. At times, it is beneficial to make alliances with other tribes in order to try and form a unified front against the foreigners, but be aware that the other tribes may turn on you and help end the Dine culture.

Navajo Wars is a fascinating and innovative game and provides a unique gaming experience. It is highly recommended but be aware, it takes time to learn and even more time to master.

Based on 4 plays and 1 win. At first I was not feeling too comfortable with the flow of the game. Honestly, I didn't know what the heck I was supposed to do. But luckily it didn't take too long (1 scenario in 1 evening) to get into it. The best indication that I'm playing a great game? When I start to figure out my next moves without sitting in front of the game. Done! thx Joel :-)

After my third game I have yet to get a win but that hardly seems an issue at the moment. I am just enjoying so much the journey of getting to know how this extraordinary game works. As you get more familiar with the procedures and rules - aided by the wealth of helpful postings at BGG - the actual game gets much clearer and less complex than it first seems. 

Another solo game I have played a bit is Mage Knight and I find that very complicated and too hard to make decisions as I am playing. I much prefer the complexity in Navajo Wars - underneath is a small set of important variables to weigh up and timing is everything when choosing your operations. It has definitely repaid the effort and time spent learning it.

Feels like it takes a lot of effort to learn; quite intimidating at first. Complicated games are not usually a challenge, but exhaustion from personal life and the unique nature of this game made it seem to have a high entry barrier.

Very good solitaire game, when someone plays it for the first time he will find it complex enough because when you take an operation (planning,take actions,passage of time) there is so much you'll have to plan but after some plays all are simply enough.
After lots of crushing defeats i managed to win the Spanish and Mexican scenarios and now it's the time for the Americans hehehe.
I find "Navajo Wars" a very cleverly designed game with the right amount of atmosphere, tension and interesting strategic decisions.

A recommended solitaire game :)

As a big fan of Hampton Sides' book "Blood and Thunder" about Kit Carson and the Navajos, this game immediately intrigued me when I first saw it. The game does not disappoint and does a great job of simulating about 250 years of colorful Southwest history. There is an initial time investment required to get into the full swing of the game (playing through the tutorial and mastering the rules), but it is well worth the effort.

The game is very well designed to deliver a complex narrative in small chunks that you can evaluate and respond to.  No aspect of gameplay seems lugubrious or labored.   It is fun to play, and stressful too as you see the predicaments unfold, one by one, that force the management of your Navajo families down the path of survival.   I've only played the "easy" scenario (early Spanish period) around six or seven times.  I've won the scenario once.

I appreciate games that break new ground and take board-gaming outside the box.  Navajo Wars is one of those games. It is different from most, both in theme and implementation.  I enjoy the historical narrative this game generates.  This is a terrific solitaire game which borders more on being a eurogame than a wargame.  At first glance the rules were a little daunting but with a little perseverance things fall into place quickly. I was nervous that the rules for implementing the AI could be a little tiresome (as per Andean Abyss when playing 4 player AI) but [b]one of the standouts for me with this game is how smooth and quickly the AI operates once one understands the procedures.  This allows my focus to be on strategy and tactics rather than running the game engine. [/b] My only disappointment with the game has been the errata, it really bugs me having to rewrite sections of the rulebook (-1pt).  

Great game Joel.

  A very interesting, creative, and frustrating game. But frustrating in a good sense; don't expect to master this in one or two plays. It's a challenge to prosper against the Spanish, Mexicans and Americans (as it should be). And the AI is superb. 

  I like the fact you can choose what 'skills' you want your families to have.

  I've only played a couple of times, but I think my rating will only increase over time, as I learn to play (and appreciate) this game more. Hats off to Joel Toppen and GMT on a fantastic game.

A rather intimidating learning curve, but once you're in, this game creates a really beautiful and tragic evocation of a fascinating chapter of history.  Disaster always seems to be right around the corner, driven by an unpredictable and really creative AI that manages to feel like it's powered by pure spite.  I need to come back to this game more often, because it's a stunning piece of work.

Also very curious to try the 2p variant, even though I doubt I'll ever get the chance.

When I saw GMT's announcement for Navajo Wars, I though, "Oh, that should be interesting; I'll look into that when I have a chance."  Then I read the blurbs on GMTgames.com and BGG, and I thought, "Holy crap, this looks awesome."  

I wonder if I should put myself in a coma until it is shipped?  That way I don't have to experience stress of the months of conscious waiting.

Good overall solitaire effort. Lots of choices you can make. Enemy instructions mechanic works well. Victory Checks seems like chaotic randomness of adding and subtracting, moving and matching just to keep you at either +3 or -3 for a win or loss. There is a lot to remember as well like when to spend, raise or lower Ferocity, AP's, MP's, Morale and Culture and games can run long. Overall, very satisfied with the game and the theme.

The design goals are thoughtful and the core AI a brilliant innovation, among ideas like a lovely raid mechanic that flares out from Sante Fe like the long tongue of a snake. 

Read the designers notes on page 28 of the playbook. If you are drawn to them, and leave the game out for some time & work through the rules, it ebb & flows beautifully as the Dine withstand cultural & military incursions.

This kind of game is long overdue.  There's umpty-billion games treating the overrun and exploitation of the New World from the white European perspective, and it's great to finally get something that makes the natives more than just speed bumps to run over on your path to domination of the continent.  The gameplay is very different from anything else I've played.  Not only is it solitaire, but the actions you take are very threaded, and it's not intuitive how they fit into one another.  You have to play reactively, taking what the game allows you, and it's impossible to do everything you want.

From my limited understanding, this models the period pretty well.  The Dine (Navajo) might weather the early period alright, but it gets very, very difficult to keep everything in balance.  The pressure mounts from the successive invasions of first the Spanish, then the Mexicans, and finally the Americans with the dreaded Kit Carson.  The empire will start out alright, but it can crumble very quickly.

[COLOR=#FFFFFF][BGCOLOR=#000000]1P[/BGCOLOR][/COLOR] Navajo Wars is the first game in Joel Toppens First Nation series. A highly thematic and near perfect card-driven solitaire game that simulates the rise and fall of the Navajos. I enjoy the historical narrative this game generates. There are a lot of unique and clever mechanics in this game and the AI is both smooth and challenging. I'd even go so far as to call it a masterpiece of solitaire design.

RATING: 8
I'm not sure how much "fun" this one is, but I will say it is an achievement in cardboard A.I., with a very clever order system that telegraphs future moves; yet it also allows surprise actions to hit you when your guard is down. The game itself is like being trapped in a locked room full of unlabeled levers and buttons. Every action you take leads you down a long convoluted list of procedural steps, the output of which is often a surprise, particularly when you are first learning the game. It has taken me a few long, painful plays to start being able to connect the dots, but I'm there finally, so now it's all about finding a better way to avoid the traps the game sets for you.

In that respect, I think the game does a wonderful job of presenting the troubles that plagued the Navajo. Raiding the forts and towns is the only way to get the resources needed to fight the encroachment of the outsiders, but violence begets violence and that path leads to your tribe being hunted. Leaving them alone however, gets you nothing but more encroachment, missions built on your land and the culture of your people eroding to non-relevance. Combine that with a harsh land to live on in the first place and it is not hard to feel for these people, trapped between a rock and a hard place.

That sense of theme and storytelling is hard to unlock here, but once you get to the meat of it, your little cardboard chits will take on a life all their own.

Positives:

- It's a really interesting idea for a game. It's great that designers are looking to unusual or less well covered topics for their games.
- The graphic design is very evocative. 10 out of 10 to the artists.
- A huge amount of thought and effort has obviously gone into the game.

Negatives:

Laurel and I played the solo game together. We really wanted to like it, but in the end the game fell flat for both of us. It just didn't hold our interest enough to want to play it again. I don't know whether it's the procedural nature of the game or that there seemed a lack of options during the main part of the turn, or something else, but it just didn't work for us.

Final thoughts:

One thing that the game isn't though is under-developed. This seems to be an increasingly popular criticism of games, which in the vast majority of cases I don't believe is warranted. Yes, there are a handful of recent releases that I can think of that it wouldn't be unfair to label thus, but for the most part I think it's just a case of one man's meat is another man's poison. Sometimes you just have to accept that attitude to games is largely subjective and that you're not going to like every game you play.

This is a hard game for me to get my arms around since you rarely pursue your goals directly which makes it hard to develop a viable strategy. In that regards, it reminds me of the first few times I played Labyrinth: The War on Terror, 2001 – ?.  Since I play Euro and other games, I am not hung up on whether this is a wargame or not, but I am still trying to decide if I like it.  It has some interesting mechanics and the AI is decent, but I simply do not find this game that interesting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Navajo Wars succesfully finds the sweet spot between playability and complexity: running the AI leaves most of your brainpower for your own game while still holding up the illusion of a smart opponent.

The designer succeeds in what he has tried to accomplish. Playing Navajo Wars creates a narrative where the Enemy keeps doing unfair and unforgivable things to the Navajo people. Every time. Winning is incredibly rewarding, because it's difficult and rare. If you only stare at the mechanics, most of the little details, switches, gimmicks and moving parts are kind of unnecessary. But each and every one of them exist for one important reason: the narrative.

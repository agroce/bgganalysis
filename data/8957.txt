Loved this game for 6 years and integrating it with Interceptor and Leviathan.  But that got tedious.  Notwithstanding a universe that mixes Star Wars and the Roman Empire, its Sci-fi vision is detailed and mesmerizing.  The  template damage is fun, but actually increased the amount of time needed to play. Combining this game with Dirtside II is a great way to balance the time factor.

RATING: 8
Certainly the best of the Renegade Legion line.  Well-designed, very playable.  A less complex and more playable damage system than Interceptor.  Lacks the illogical scaling system of Leviathan.  It's damage system still inspires great games today, like Warmachine.  And who can forget the effect of Thor satellites?

But man, I still have a soft spot for Leviathan.

I remember the vehicle construction rules in this one being a little less than perfect, but that's a small problem in a game that had the COOLEST DAMAGE SYSTEM EVER!! Again, a lapse on my part caused this one to depart my collection...

Liked the background (tanks that can attack from orbit, and infantry that can turn off gravity at will!), but only got to play once. Reasonable system based on reading.

RATING: 10
Superb game (especially for the time) with grav tanks racing around a battlefield just above the surface of the ground. Lots of variety, good mechanics, and even a couple of fiction books to get you in the mood. Great classic game.

RATING: 3
Picked it up used from a friend, along with the Cohort packs (a bunch of plastic tank miniatures).  The system is a little dated - even clunkier than Battletech.  The damage system is interesting, but it's not enough to make the game playable.

RATING: 7
Probably the best overall of the Renegade Legion skirmish games.  Very fun land combat, the damage system strikes a happy medium between Interceptor and Leviathan.

I have the first edition, with the 3d tuckbox counters, and I actually like them better than plastic minis.  I really like how they use die cut stands to denote altitude.

I'd really like to try combining this with one of the other games sometime.

This is not a board game but is really a miniatures game in a box.  2nd edition even came with miniature figures (1st edition had little boxes for the tanks).

I always LOVED this idea for armor penetration!

Vastly under-rated here IMHO and I am now working on two forces from the old FASA plastic boxed sets!

This was a game of hover armored combat, Hammers Slammers anyone? The system had unique mechanics that I had not see before. I liked the title but sadly never got to play it much.

Fun game with small number of units. Definitely has a SF feel, as opposed to 20th century rules with a tacked on SF theme.

Not as interesting as Interceptor to me, since the things I liked (damage and ship construction) aren't as fun.  The underlying game is probably better, but oh well.

Haven't played this one in years (almost decades).  Still, I remember it was a lot of fun, in the Battletech mode.  Also, it has minis!

Did a good job of giving its grav tanks a very different feel than conventional warmachines (in many ways, they handle more like aircraft than land vehicles) while retaining a certain combined arms emphasis.  Complexity level is quite high, however, and players will need to understand a lot of different concepts to play the game well.  For my money, the best offering in the Renegade Legion series.

Just tried this with my 10-year old. He got the game, and it still plays well, though the Declaration Phases added to the Resolution Phases, especially with the Laser Painting set of phases really slows down this game compared to others. We might adopt squad-level turn (rather than individual unit turns) and drop the declaration phases to speed things up.

I played the hell out of RL:C in high school, but never found anyone who enjoyed it enough to commit to its lengthy play time after that.

I absolutely love the damage templates -- one of my all-time favorite game elements, period -- and the fold-together cardboard ships from the first edition. The rules are solid, and I remember our contests being evenly matched.

Really the only downside is a punishingly long play time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better than expected.  A solid SF tactical armour game with good thematic feel for flying grav tanks.  Thor satellites and orbital bombardment are devastating, but not instantly lethal iirc.

Deadly fast paced combat, probably the best game in the Renegade Legion series of games.

Could never buy into the ridiculous setting of the game universe with a reincarnated "Roman Empire" conquering the stars.

Not a bad FASA entry. The setting could be interesting, but you don't see enough of it. The damage templates against armor are an interesting idea, but it seems to me it makes all armor ablative, which isn't how it normally works.

The game works well enough and has very interesting features. However it is very slow to play which makes little sense when you are supposed to be gaming incredibly fast grav vehicles.

Centurion has two standout features. First, the armor system, which actually tracks the shape of the damage pattern from different weapons and munitions using a schematic of each tank's armor and internal components (e.g. lasers make a straight line impact, HEAP munitions carve a big pit, etc). Second, the antigrav movement, which had tanks moving a lot like "space fighters" do in many 2D games, but with considerations for safe speed over terrain or flying high (and vulnerable) to avoid such concerns.

Much love for this one.

RATING: 5
I love the combat resolution system where you use a template to determine how the round penetrates the armor. However, I don't care for the movement rule that requires a tank to ground because it has some velocity points remaining. That seems so arbitrary, but it's difficult to come up with a viable alternative using a hexboard. If you used miniatures on the tabletop instead, then your tank could move a fraction of an inch for the remaining velocity points.

More interesting and smoother game-play than Battletech. Could have used better infantry rules, but this still sees occasional play on my gaming table (with minis, not those stupid 1ed box things). Best of the RL series games; gets more interesting with the vehicle briefing and Technical Update books. Loses two points for the inane "Romans in Space" setting.

Trade interest low.  Extra copy, never opened.  Still shrink-wrapped but wrap is starting to come open on the bottom, box with minor dents and some wear on corners.  This is the first edition, with the cardboard tanks - NOT the second edition with plastic minis.

This game is fun, but not as fun as Battletech from the same makers.

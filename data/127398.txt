Fun game, a timing and strategy puzzle, and pretty challenging. Elements of Castle Panic, Mage Knight, even a bit of Arkham Horror. Setup time greatly reduced by custom insert from Kevin S. Can be punishing to risk taking but no player elimination. Recommended by the 1 Player Guild.

RATING: 5
Not at all a fan, but rating a 5 because it's a functional game and might be a fun solo. Played twice. In the second game, one player with slight input figured out the strategy for victory, laid out the plan, and then we just spent all game executing it without any real decision-making. Nothing came up to really derail us, despite some monster spawns.  By the time we reached the boss we had to take down in the scenario (not mentioning  which one to avoid spoilers),  we were all so well-prepared that despite his best double-six rolls, he died in a single turn. One major issue with the game was the huge downtimes. Sometimes it was very advantageous to have one character waste all their moves on one very short task. After that, the player had nothing to do  for the whole scenario. As a result, players who had finished until the next day would go chat with friends, leading them to not be involved in the big decision-making. By the time they returned, the strategy was fully laid out and their move was already optimized. Sometimes people chose to do something suboptimal  just for fun, but it's annoying to me when a game makes it so clear what the optimal moves are. I felt the game was playing us rather than us playing the game. Moves are tight in the game and the right move is clear, so it's impossible for alpha gamer types to not dominate. Overall - I can't say I had a bad time playing this game, but compared to the ambiguity of games like Pandemic or the hidden information  of games like Dead of Winter, I doubt I could justify actually playing this game again, unless I was playing solo. And frankly, there's better, less-fiddly solo games out there.

I wasn't impressed. events are random, but not too random that makes replayability better. turns can be slow sometimes. needs the right group, as this is can turn into a "quarterbacking" game, which it did for me. a random event killed us in one turn, very odd.

RATING: 7.5
I think for an easy to get into fantasy, this is the best way to do it. For balance, it swings alot. It starts off deceptively easy - too easy in fact. And then after a legend or two, you get dumped into the deep end of the pool. The game at that point becomes a stressful puzzle requiring repeated plays to solve. Not sure how many times I'm willing to do that. Such a technique works in a computer game, but given the over all set up and play time, not sure in a board game. Still, I like it and would like to see the expansions in English (I'm certain I'm not alone in that).

EDIT: I did eventually solve all of it. It *was* purely a puzzle in the end - once you find the solution, the game is tense, but mechanical. It truly needs expansions to keep it alive, but I find my interest is waning in the view of other fantasy romps heading to my collection soon.

Very unique game, a campaign style adventure that unfolds in front of you with surprising twists, a gorgeous map and components and with a puzzly feel to it. It has male and female heroes to choose from, who you can customise, it has all kinds of monsters to kill but be careful of the time mechanic as some events (like killing monsters) will trigger the adventure to go faster. The game mechanics may be a bit too prescribing at times and it might feel clinical

Although this game has some nice aspects it gets deleted from my "interested to buy" list. The components are great and I mean great! The graphics are perfect, the cardboard is thick and nice to play with.
The theme is nice but light fantasy themed and therefore better something for families with small children.
But the game is quiet challenging for family gamers and probably a bit too hard.
The replayability for casual gamers is very low. 5 legends come with the game but we played two of them succesfully in about 3 hours.
Sounds perfect for expansions with more legends.

RATING: 7
Monsters moving to the castle reminds me of [thing=65532][/thing], but outside of components (DotR has GREAT plastic), this game is superior to Defenders in every other way.  
The story is more engaging and the game play is less Euro-y.  It can run a bit long and maybe has a puzzle aspect that takes away re-playability, but that just means I won't buy it, but I'll be happy to play somebody else's copy.

Kudos to Menzel for creating a game with a minimal initial ruleset!  The art is really, really terrific, and many of the mechanics work quite well together.  Alas, it is a co-op game, and it suffers all of the problems that comes along with that subgenre.  And it seems like it may have limited replayability.  We already got to an unwinnable situation and had to end the game early.  I really want to like this more.

I played this game only three times, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I've strong mixed feelings about Legends of Andor. The first time I played it I was really disappointed, because I was expecting a very different game. I felt the mechanism of the storyteller to be restrictive and annoying, because I wanted to kill monsters freely instead. Starting from my second play I approached it as a puzzle to be solved instead of an "hack and slash"-kind of game and I liked it much more... but still felt kinda limited by the rules of the game.

There are many reasons to like this game. First of all the artwork is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. The board is full of tiny interesting details, that really make the game come to life, and it's maybe the thing I like the most about Legends of Andor. At the same time the game presents itself pretty well also mechanic-wise, as the turns flow smooth and without much downtime. It's also interesting to see a fantasy adventure game with such strong euro-mechanisms combined with a strong narrative frame. For sure this hybridization is part of the game's success, as it appeals to different kinds of players.

Yet, as far as I'm concerned, I liked the game but not as much as I wanted to like it. I felt restricted by its mechanisms, because there's always a few moves that you HAVE TO take during the course of the game and I don't like the fact that basically the game is forcing me to make a specific choice. It's really a pity though, because I've been searching for a good cooperative game for quite some time and I thought this could be one that would fit my taste. Maybe that's why I've such strong mixed feelings... because I see what this game could have been for me, if only a few mechanisms would have been different. That's why, even if I enjoy it and I recognize that it's a good game, this seems like a negative review, even if the rating is positive.

I wanted to love this game, but I expected something different from it. I still like it, I would gladly play it again... but I can't help being a little upset for a few mechanisms, that significantly reduced my enjoyment. Good game, but arghhh!

Many co-ops feel like you are completely at the luck of the draw. This means winning or losing feels like its determined by a shuffle. Legends of Andor didn't feel that way at all. The story is driven by the cards and the gameplay is very smooth. Did not feel clunky the way many coops do. 

Bonus points for the way the game is learned, I hope more games adopt the tutorial mode approach.

Pros:
+ Brain-burner adventure
+ Beautiful art, really impressive
+ Very nice narrative
+ Overall good quality components
+ Somewhat fast game (1 to 2 hours)
+ Very enjoyable as solo or co-op
+ Simple rules; excellent rules book; excellent learn as you play system

Cons:
- Bad English and Portuguese translations; there are errors in game components that interfere with game play
- Low replayability; requires new legends to maintain interest

Neutral:
+- Cards are on the cheap side
+- Creatures AI is predictable but that is what drive the puzzle aspect of the game

как сразу же заметила Л., сюжет всё-таки ощутимо обогащает игровой процесс. кампания состоит из пяти связанных друг с другом сценариев, шестой автор предлагает придумать самим (даже вложил пустые карточки). 

сама игра - не вполне традиционное фентези. оно с первого взгляда может показаться америтрешем, но на самом деле это скорее головоломка. кубики играют куда меньшую роль, чем в "Аркхэме", а каждый убитый враг передвигает фишку рассказчика (= кладёт жетон безысходности, ускоряя пробуждение Древнего). т.е. тут нужно именно выполнить задания сценария, а биться только по острой необходимости. автор, кстати, адресовал данную "проблему" в первом же большом дополнении к игре ("Легенда вторая: Поход на Север") - там рассказчика двигает только каждый второй (а позже третий) трупик.

другая любопытная деталь - я не уверен, что вчетвером играть проще. город тогда нужно оборонять куда тщательней, а прямая выгода от четырёх героев - лишь в битве (ну и ходить можно в разные места, возможно в других сценариях это будет важно).

(ожидал, что примерно такой игрой будет "Властелин колец" Книции)

воин и маг решают.

Лида после четвёртой легенды: "Хорошая игра, есть ощущение, что голова постоянно работает, а не просто следит глазами за некими действиями, с плохо обусловленным выбором между ними".

Great game, co-operative play means that players of different skill levels (read: older and younger siblings) can play together without the weaker players feeling taken advantage of.  At it's heart it is a puzzle game, which means it can be "solved" if played a lot, but the setting and artwork really captures the imagination, and the official and fan stories creates emotional investment.  Great game for families (adults and kids playing together).

Pretty fun. I was expecting it to be sort of like Pandemic, but with more theme and story, and I would probably say that's a fairly accurate description.

Unlike Pandemic, there's collaboration right off the bat. Everyone has to work together as a team, not just haphazardly run around clearing up cubes. And, since you need to split your attention between multiple goals, there's a lot more strategy of deciding how to balance your play. And despite all of this, it's still a fairly straightforward game to learn. You move or fight. If you move, you get to do the whatever at the place you stop.

So I definitely like it better than Pandemic as a game.

But, on the other hand, it's really a bear to set up. Besides going through checklists of components to hunt down and allocate, you also have to deal with the haphazard arrangement of numbers on the board when placing things. Of the 90 minute playtime, you could easily spend 20 minutes doing setup. If you're just planning to play once and then tear it down, it's probably not worth it. I'd suggest passing on this one unless you can set it up and leave it out on a table for a week or two while you play through the campaign.

And as to the campaign, I have so far only played the tutorial (Legend 1) and Legend 2. And, in both, the real engine of the game is killing monsters that are encroaching on the castle. I'm not sure how the other map works (on the backside of the board), but I'll be a bit disappointed if every Legend amounts to playing the tower defense style game, while running a few mini-missions to the side. And, unfortunately, that's really how the "story" felt in the game. While you will often get 2-3 (tarot card sized) pages per chapter of the Legend, the story blurbs are probably less than 20% of the total text and most of the rest of it is new numbers to find and put monsters on, for the tower defense game.

Given the still rather slight quantity of story in the game, the sheer quantity of little chits seems excessive.

So...I like it as a cooperative. I'd appreciate the thematic elements more if I could leave all the chits out and not have to clean up and set back up each time I play. But as a game to take to meetups, this one is probably not going to see much light. It doesn't tell a good enough story to make it worth the hassle.

RATING: 6
 Καθαρά συνεργατικό fantasy παιχνίδι όπου οι παίκτες σε ρόλο ηρώων προσπαθούν να φέρουν εις πέρας αποστολές ενώ παράλληλα προστατεύουν το βασίλειο από επιθέσεις ορκ. Κλασσικό theme αλλά αυτό δεν είναι απαραίτητα κακό.
	
Το παιχνίδι αντί για μινιατούρες χρησιμοποιεί χάρτινα stand-ups. Τα τόκενς είναι καλοφτιαγμένα και το artwork είναι εξαιρετικό (εγγύηση ο Menzel) οπότε δεν με ενόχλησε καθόλου η απουσία μινιατούρων. Οι ήρωες γενικά προχωράν στο χάρτη, σκοτώνουν τέρατα και υπάρχουν κάποια σημεία που αλληλεπιδρούν με το ταμπλό. Κάνουν Level up και αγοράζουν εξοπλισμό.  Να σημειωθεί πως το ταμπλό είναι διπλής όψεως με άλλες περιοχές στη πίσω πλευρά.

Περιέχονται 4-5 πίστες οι οποίες συνδέονται σεναριακά κάτι σαν ψευτό-campaign δηλαδή. Η κάθε πίστα έχει συγκεκριμένα events που συμβαίνουν σε προκαθορισμένα χρονικά διαστήματα και προωθούν την ιστορία. Εδώ βρίσκεται και το πρώτο πρόβλημα του παιχνιδιού καθώς ναι μεν η όλη φάση έχει πολύ ενδιαφέρον την πρώτη φορά που παίζεις την πίστα αλλά από την άλλη άπαξ και ξέρεις τι πρόκειται να συμβεί τότε χάνεται η μαγεία και αρχίζεις να  προσπαθείς να τρέξεις ή να καθυστερήσεις το επόμενο event. Με λίγα λόγια οι πίστες πάσχουν από replayability.

Το άλλο που δεν μου έκατσε καλά είναι το γεγονός πως ο χρόνος τρέχει κάθε φορά που σκοτώνεις κάποιο τέρας και επειδή ο χρόνος γενικά είναι λίγος πρέπει να σκεφτείς πόσα και ποιά τέρατα πρέπει να σκοτώσεις. Προσωπικά βρίσκω αντι-θεματικό το ότι το παιχνίδι σε τιμωρεί αν σκοτώσεις πολλά τέρατα. Τι σούπερ ουάου ήρωες είμαστε αν αφήνουμε επιλεκτικά τέρατα να μπουν στην πρωτεύουσα??  

Τα όποια μειονεκτήματα του παιχνιδιού πιστεύω πως λύνονται με 1-2 expansions και το καλό είναι πως το παιχνίδι είναι φτιαγμένο έτσι που να είναι εύκολα expandable. Αν δεν θέλετε να μπείτε στον κόπο μπορείτε να παίξετε μια φορά όλες τις πίστες για την εμπειρία και μετά να το δώσετε για ανταλλαγή.

Top five artwork of any game. It's impressive and immersive and very different from average board games, such that it doesn't even really have a rulebook per say. Each scenario plays differently, and feels like a grand adventure in another world.

+ I've yet to experience the involvement this game elicits! You really feel like you're in this kind of Lord of the Rings universe where you and your team are fighting against the evil.
+ Legends of Andor is more a puzzle than a wargame, you carefully need to plan which monsters you will eliminate. (Trying) to kill all monsters will accelerate the game, thus making it impossible to fulfill your quests and win the game.

- Unfortunately a game of Andor takes some time (+ setup and cleaning up!), that's why we do not play it as often as we'd like to.

I find this game enjoyable for the POTENTIAL for a good story, the questing elements, and the varied characters/abilities.  All in all, the game delivers.

My major complaint about the game is that the story is sadly weak (they probably felt they had too much text and the story was pushed aside to explain rules).

My other major complaint is that this game is HARD! Really hard.  Anyone who says otherwise is probably cheating.  

But I do not regret this game in any way and love it!

Kellemes meglepetés, aranyos kis bevezető fantasyjáték, pár egész  jó ötlettel. Pl. a bábuk helyének definiálása, az automatikus mozgásuk a nyilak mentén kifejezetten tetszik, a legenda hangulata pedig jól átjön a körítőszövegek révén. A magyar kiadásba bekerült pár hiba, de szerintem túl volt ez lihegve, nem érzem zavarónak! Simán elmegy még a nagyáruházak polcain is, bár a nagymama nem mindenhol fog vele leülni játszani:) 
Nem könnyű, de azt hallottam egész nagy szórások vannak a küldetések nehézségében. Szerintem elég jó az "alap motor", amihez könnyű új küldetéseket kreálni/kiadni, így biztosítva van az újrajátszhatóság...

Solo with two adventurers at first and failed scenario 1 twice! Then switched to using three heroes and have succeeded at Legend 2 with archer, warrior and dwarf, at Legend 3 with warrior, archer and wizard and at Legend 4 with warrior, wizard and dwarf. Returned to warrior, archer and wizard to squeak a victory by the slimmest margins over the dragon!

Would mark higher, but just concerned about how much replay I will get out of this. Think it is probably best solo as well.

No rate since our first experience was so strange.  I think the first learning adventure is a really boring way to learn a game, and we found ambiguities in severeal texts.  We were not really understanding what was going on.

Unfortunately not better than robinson crusoe, and it got out at the same time. It seems a perfectly wonderful family coop game, with less depth than robinson but still a good game and wonderfully produced. I expected perhaps some new impressive mechanics, but I did enjoy it. The gameplay decision level reminded me of Knizia's lord of the rings. I only played the introductory scenario, looking forward to another game.

Michael Menzel is one of the most renowned artists in the boardgame industry, and I am a big fan. When I heard about his first design, and about all the marketing Kosmos put in place for it... I was intrigued a lot!

The game itself is a coop adventure, where the german school of design intrudes in a field that's normally the domain of ameritrash: mechanics are simple and elegant, and dice rolls can be mitigated in various ways.

The game's aesthetics are obviously top tier, and the absence of plastic miniatures is barely noticeable, thanks to the wonderful stand ups Menzel drew.

The game itself contains five different Legends (or quests), and only the first couple (designed as tutorials) are not replayable: the others have an amount of random elements and can be replayed at will.

Definitely a good game, that deserves its prizes!

Interesting fantasy game with frustrating mechanisms and poor scaling below 4 players. My biggest gripe was inability to win without forknowledge and favorable deployment rolls. Has been surpassed by newer "dungeon crawls"

Menzel's a hall of famer in the industry for his art alone, and this game only enhances his legacy. Great classic fantasy feel; a captivating, unique, thoughful adventure for group or solo play. But don't think there won't be some high-fives around the table -- there ARE dice after all!

RATING: 6
For the most part, I enjoyed the plays I had.
My main drawbacks are the puzzle-feeling and that the story-chapters have only limited replay value.
Especially towards the end of the game it turned into a puzzle for me. One session I was able to prove that we have no chance at winning 4 turns before the game regularly ended :(
And if you know the story of a given chapter you already know what will happen and can therefore prepare and don't get caught on the wrong foot.
The 2 drawbacks add to each other – the more I know what will happen, the sooner I leave the fantasy-realm and begin to start to view it as an abstract, a puzzle.

Now my comment sounds more negative than it's meant to be :)
I enjoyed playing the game, but be wary that you may only have quite a limited amount of plays in the box (bang for your buck).

A beautiful co-op that I enjoy immensely but it suffers from being too puzzle like. I mean, you have to do things in an exact order to complete any mission after the introductory one. And, you need to get super lucky chucking dice to beat the few combats that you are required to have. If you go into this remembering that it's NOT a grand fantasy, hack n slash fest, but a puzzly co-op where your best option is to usually NOT fight enemies, you will have fun.

Con [url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com.es/2013/07/resena-n-22-las-leyendas-de-andor.html#more]Las leyendas de Andor[/url] estemos posiblemente ante un juego que no encaja con ninguno de los lectores de esta reseña (yo incluido), pero que nosotros no somos su público objetivo, somos el hilo conductor. Jugado en mi grupo habitual, Las Leyendas de Andor no pasaría el corte de la segunda leyenda (la primera no cuenta, es un tutorial) y se iría directo al fondo de la estantería, al mercadillo o a la mastrade, pero con mi crío esto cambia, la liga en que juega es otra, su baremo es otro. El que suscribe vive con intensidad y al unísono las aventuras a través de sus ojos, de su perspectiva, con su percepción de lo que acontece, donde cada combate, cada lanzamiento de dados, cada lectura de carta, cada evento y contratiempo es una nueva sensación para él y a mi, me recuerda lo que sentía cuando a su edad, jugaba con mi hermano al Heroquest.

La excitación de la planificación del turno, diciendo cosas como “… papa, no te preocupes, de éste que me encargo yo, porque mi guerrero puede lanzar cuatro dados. Después con el oro, me voy al mercader a subir mi fuerza”. Llevo cuatro partidas en una semana (él ya está de vacaciones), no hace mas que pedirme otra y presiento que estoy ante un juego incombustible, ya que no le importa repetir escenarios (hemos hecho dos veces las dos primeras leyendas para consolidar conceptos) aunque sepa que es lo que va a salir.

Y es que el germen ha sido plantado. Antes de encarar el reto de la destrucción del anillo único en “La guerra del anillo” o evitar que despierte el primigenio en una lejana ciudad de Massachuset en “Arkham Horror”, tenemos vivir, sufrir y prepararnos en “Las Leyendas de Andor”.

 Legends of Andor is overflowing with theme and there is just enough strategy and tactics to keep it engaging. It really is a unique and engaging co-op. Although the don’t-Kill-too-many-monster dynamic confuses some people thematically, it is really a great idea that creates a lot of tension.

Initial rating (9.5) after first play of the 1st legend. Cracked open the box and just played along and it was one of the most awesome experiences i have ever witnessed in a first play. All four of us were completely blown away although we only started playing at midnight.

Absolutely brilliant.

Update after two more plays (Legend 2, failed both times):

This is a perfect 10 for me. It has everything that a game needs. Interaction, Dice, an Adventure that is being told and lots of cool stuff for the Adventurers.

Awesome ! Absolutely recommended especially for families with 7+ year olds.

Update: Slight downgrade to 9 which will stay for a while i think

I need to play it at more player counts to see for sure but so far this is my perfect co-op adventure game. It really jumps off the table for me in a magical way. I tend to find I enjoy the art more than the theme in a lot of thematic games. So rather than bring up the tired discussion of theme matching mechanics, I would argue that in Legends of Andor, the art and graphic design matches the mechanics. This is likely because the artist and the game designer are one and the same. This makes me want to try some Ryan Laukat designs to see if I feel the same about any of those.

Very interesting fantasy monster slaying game.  Different than most--much more of a puzzle--kill too many monsters, and you run out of time.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best cooperative games out there.  Don't go in looking for a dungeoncrawl slashfest.  This game is a puzzle wrapped in a fantasy world.  The theme is definitely present and you feel like you are going on a quest, but time is limited, and you can't detour from your mission in the slightest or you will lose.  One downside is that the quests in the base game have limited replayability (In my opinion).  You'll get 5 quests, at maybe 2 games each.  Legend 3 is slightly more replayable.  Still pretty good value for the game.  I highly recommend the star shield expansion which is an extremely replayable legend.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Played the first legend, which is a nice way to learn the game (although it isn't that complicated, and I think they went a bit overboard with the tutorial, there are some components that are just used to explain the game).

The combat and movement are somewhat very "fixed" and the gameplay feels a little klunky at times. Furthermore I think the replayability is low as you know the setups and what to do when you have played a scenario.

RATING: 9
Wonderful co-op puzzle that not only rewards coordinating actions, but often requires full collaboration (as in, players fighting together in the same battle). The scenarios are challenging enough that you don't often win your first time, but you have a better chance the second time around. There is a problem with knowing what is coming, though, which takes some of the fun out of it. Since we don't plan on playing this dozens of times a year, the lack of replayability isn't a problem for us (we usually forget what happened in a scenario when the game hits the table again). 

However, why oh why hasn't FFG agreed to support the expansions?!? And for a Spiel des Jahres nominee for that matter! If there's any game that absolutely would benefit from expansions (e.g. adding replayability with different maps/scenarios), it's this game. Because it's so language dependent, an English edition is a must. Fantasy Flight, come on!!

UPDATE: Yay! Kosmos to the rescue!

Puzzle co-op with some difficult scenarios.  The theme can feel strange considering the mechanics of the game (killing monsters advances the clock, so you will often have to let monsters sack your castle in order to have enough time to win the scenario).  Fans of Ghost Stories will like this one.

A fantasy themed puzzle.  Great for cooperative work.  The random setup creates nice variability but it also dictates the difficulty of completion.

The first scenario took us 3 attempts to beat it. When we played it a 4th time, we noticed we missed a space that would have made it much easier. Also, our dice rolling was much better. So it wasn't as challenging. But I still want to continue exploring it.

UPDATE: After playing all 5 scenarios, I still very much like it, but the variability in the quests and events may be too severe.

Andor is a pretty good cooperative game, but it is too puzzle-y for me. If you make one misstep in the game you're basically screwed which can be really frustrating. The bigger enemies are also unrealistically difficult to beat.

I had high expectations for this game! I really like cooperative games, and because of the “rules-as-you-go”, this game definitely seemed different than most of the cooperative games out there. I only managed to sneak in a single play of this with 3 other players (whom I met in a gaming club in Copenhagen). It was scenario 1 and we won quite comfortably; this scenario is almost like a puzzle and I’m eager to find out how the other scenarios feel. I do not worry that much about replayability as I would guess I could get around 3 plays out of each scenario which equals almost 20 plays, which is more plays than a lot of many other games get. I do think my rating will go up when I get to play it with my “real” friends and family, as that’s where cooperative games really shine I think.

The game is the opponent the players need to work together to beat it.
At first I was sceptical of this game due to its generic seeming and childish storytelling but I soon realized that this is a serious challange! The tasks are pretty hard at times and every won game is a true success.
Gameplay is fast and fun, the Characters each have their own style in gameplay and the tasks are diverse. I alwas enjoy this game that woks for all playertypes exept competitive ones.

My score for this game has gone steadily downward. The mechanics are simple, the graphics are great, the components are of good quality and the fact each character is playable as a male or female version complete with its corresponding figurine is simply awesome.

However, that is where the positives end, in my opinion. The set-up is quite elaborate and differs for every legend/scenario. The game is scripted, which feels like railroading. Also, since not all the information is out in the open at the start of the scenario and the scenario cards are only revealed during play, the odds can change unexpectedly during the first play of a scenario. During subsequent plays, the element of surprise is not that big. This means the game rewards experienced players and becomes less replayable over time. I find myself dreading new scenario card reveals, as they more often than not result in more bad stuff for the players.

In short, my gripe is that everything is either scripted and bad for the players OR entirely random. The game feels very unfair and does not allow for anyone going about their own business to even the slightest extent.

The board is beautiful and the action can get deliciously tense as hordes of monsters converge on the castle, with only you and your stalwart companions to save the realm. But the game does suffer from the "Alpha Gamer" issue that plagues so many co-op games like this and Pandemic. Beware one member of the team ordering the rest around. The game certainly rewards cooperation (it's indeed essential), yet it's far more enjoyable if a little free will is permitted.

Cooperative game in which players have to work together to complete the scenario. Played the introduction quest and we made a mistake with the victory conditions, so only ended up half completing the quest (we lost). 

The theme isn't bad, and the components are ok (although miniatures would have been nice). 

3/8/13 - Played again, and lost the second legend this time. We realised that you need to invest a fair amount of time planning an optimum strategy in order to win this game. Frankly it doesn't seem worth it, as for me the game isn't sufficiently appealing to make that kind of commitment. Feel like it should be a shorter more casual game.

Very interesting mix mix of euro and ameritrash. cooperative fantasy quest driven game? I must like it no matter what. You must look at the game as a puzzle like, quest oriented fantasy adventure - not as a dungeon crawl fight orgy.
I found the learning process very original. I also like the fact that the more creatures you kill more time will pass (so you have to decide which ones to kill and which ones let to the castle).
Theme is strong, art is beautiful.
Not the game you want to play every week, replayability is mediocre.

Just got this game the other day along with the Star Shield expansion and 5th & 6th player expansion.  So far I have only gotten to play the basic game but I already see that I love it.  Simple to learn (reading instructions & youtube vids) & fun to play.  I will be buying the expansion kits for more adventures.  Also, you can download more characters and legends (for free) from the website for the game, as well as blank legend cards so you can make your own story should you decide to go that far with it.  Great artwork and a good heavy board (double sided).

RATING: 4
I see the same main problem with this game as many of the other people who commented:
I find it utterly idiotic that the legend marker which makes you loose when it reaches the end advances for defeating monsters. Sure, fighting monsters takes time, but that is not reflected by the legend marker, it is already reflected by advancing your time marker one hour for each round of battle. If running through the forest for an hour doesn't advance the legend marker, then fighting a monster for an hour shouldn't, either.
I don't find thematic storytelling issues too important for most other games, but the very strength of this type of game should be that it tells an interesting and most of all comprehensible story about the actions of your heros as the main characters. It feels completely unheroic and illogical to have to meticulously plan if you can afford to kill another monster who wants to kill the women and children in the castle you are defending because that would cause a mysterious out-of-story storyteller to accelerate time or tell your legend faster or whatever and thus make you loose.
If there was some in-story justification for having to avoid fights such as "these monsters aren't really evil, just misguided, so you need to absolutely make sure to not kill a single one more than you have to", that could be OK I guess. Or much better, one could fix another illogical weakness of the game by making loosing against monsters have more severe consequences (short of killing the hero because player elimination sucks). That would also give the players an incentive to think about which fights they pick, if that is what the designer wants.
But no effort whatsoever seems to have been made to provide a logical in-game explanation consisent with the story that is told for why defeating monsters makes you loose.

I have only played the first introductory legend once and thus can't yet rate the stuff that gets added in the other legends, but the problem above was so off-putting for me that I didn't have much incentive to play it again.
If I still do anyway, I might change my rating a little (up or down), but I doubt it'll increase appreciably.

Other issues I have with the game are the inherent follow-the-leader tendency and the very limited replayability.

All in all, this is *by far* the most disappointing Kennerspiel des Jahres for me. Well, actually, it is the only disappointing Kennerspiel des Jahres so far, I love 7 Wonders and like Village and Istanbul.

I kind of have a love/hate relationship with this game. I think it's a fantastic game for the most part. The artwork is gorgeous, and I love the gameplay, quests, and combat. It's just really demoralizing and so very frustrating when you lose, but it's glorious when you win. The game just isn't very forgiving at all. Kill just one too many monsters or the wrong monster early in the game, and it can be the difference between winning and losing.

The game doesn't scale very well to the number of players. Legend 2 is easier with 4 players and too difficult with 2 players, but Legend 3 is too difficult with 4 players. In Legend 3, more players means more Fate cards to resolve before you can fight the final Big Bad, and that takes more time and you can only let one monster into the castle before it is overrun. Fate cards which take farmers out of the game are the worst, especially in a 4-player game.

I think the tutorial in Legend 1 is actually very innovative, but I do wish there was a more conventional rule book to go with it. When you need a clarification on some rule, it can be hard to find the rule because all the rules are spread out between the the tutorial, the Standard Setup Legend cards, various other Legend cards, the Battle board, the Merchant board, etc. There's the 4-page rules summary which attempts to bring everything together, but it's missing a bunch of rules in my experience.

I lost the first legend the first time I played it, and beat it the second time, the second legend went more smoothly then and I have now played through the 5th, but not beaten that one. That sort of soured me on this game. It has to go perfectly to win and then still relies on die roll luck which is not fun in my book.

Most of my time w/this game has been spent with solo play. Playing solo isn't very hard, but it does require a lot of room in order to get all of the character cards set up in front of you, and still be able to reach the map. 

This game's biggest drawback seems to be that every scenario is kinda a puzzle. There's a twist about 2/3 of the way thru the scenario that usually makes you lose your first time thru. Then when you try again, you know how to avoid/compensate for the twist, and you win the scenario.

Cooperative game in a phantasy setting. A nice learn as you play intro game lets you get acquainted with the basic game elements. In order to fulfill the objectives one does need to carefully study the map and the way in which the enemies will move in future turns. Just slashing gors is not a good strategy, as this is time consuming, and each legend needs to be finished within a specific time frame.

Only three plays in as I write this, but it's clear that Legends of Andor is an amazing design that will both frustrate and delight all at once.

Bought this to play with my wife and nephew. All of us were super exited after barely solving the first Legend.

And then we experienced Legend 2.

It's interesting to note everyone's experience: I became practically obsessed in trying to solve the "puzzle" ... but my wife and nephew wanted to dumb down the game in order to win after getting frustrated at the difficulty.

To me, LOA is quite the litmus test; I look forward to playing this with others to see what happens.

Update: Still can't crack Legend 2 after five attempts -- I'm clearly stupid -- but I think I see a path for success now.

The artistic display is very nice, the theme and the missions (stories)  are also well conceived, however, the gamethrough turns out too much heavy (for what it offers), the missions are too much hard (usually are only achieved on 2nd or 3rd try) and, even worse, every time there's a fail, that story has to be played just right from the beginning, even being exactly like the first one..like a computer level!

Lack of normal rules is very annoying. The concept of introducing rules as you play is interesting but I find that it doesn't work well. It's all to easy to miss some detail and too hard to find an answer with rules spread over cards and rulebooks. 

Setup is a pain. Again the rules spread and lots of thematic bits make it only worse.

Rating increased to 9 after a second session.

This is a well-polished and fun-to-play cooperative game.

The story narrative is simply top notch - it feels like you're in a role-playing adventure. The game provides plenty of thinking opportunities where different perspectives are useful.

Highly recommended.

Only tried the first scenario but it felt rather scripted to me.

Some nice ideas here such as that killing monsters will end the game faster (logic behind this?) and the timer (a la Thebes) for movement and fighting. Still the usual cooperative game problem that you either plan your turn together or have one person telling everyone what they should do.

Nice art and components.

Update: Great with the kids, would rate it a 8  here.

Players represent heroes, summoned to Andor to protect the kingdom.  Cooperative fantasy game, told in story/event format.  Players have 7 hours in the day to take actions around the land, and may "exert" themselves to take three more hours.  Players may attack monsters roaming the land, but with the caveat they are accelerating the story which may bring on more monsters, and hasten the end of the game.  The plot advances with a deck of legend cards, which bring on monsters, give the heroes quests, and tick things over.  Monsters move in regular fashion, advancing from space to space, but always edging closer to the castle (and player defeat).  Combat is almost pure Talisman, roll some dice and add strength.  Really well designed game, with some nice ideas, great way of presenting the rules, and looks stunningly beautiful.  Five legends to play, double sided game board, tons of bits in the box, really low entry cost - you could sit down and play this with grandma.  Descent has been bumped - this is so much nicer to play, and offers a good thinky challenge.  Excellent.

interesting and fun game -- although largely luck based on dice rolling combat -- however, board artwork is brilliant, and game play set up superb -- however, we played through the 5 quests (wrongly, as it turns out) .. a big minus being there are no more quests written out !!!  .... afraid this would become very very stale after a while -- however, we should have to play according to correct rules (mistakenly did not) and perhaps will re-rate after -- but lack of new quests would make replay value fairly non-existant -- however , it was very good fun, and a challenge to play, would play again, but not purchase however .. need a good solid night, and people without aversion to tossing dice all night ...

We started to play and were fascinated by this game. Yesterday we played it three times in a row and finally defeated the black dragon.

What I really love about the game:

+ It is really storytelling
+ Every time it plays differently
+ The artwork is great
+ It is a fantasy game but with lighter theme
+ Although there are random factors in the game, it is necessary to plan and possible to win by good gameplay
+ It sometimes feels like a riddle how and when each character should act
+ Just by killing monsters as much as you can will lead to your defeat
+ The game has kind of an AI, so that the monsters appear and move "by themselves" (but of course the game itself can not really "react" or change its strategy in order to deal with the actions of the heroes. Nevertheless the heroes actions trigger meaningfull events)So sometimes it feels like playing a videogame (in a good sense)

I think it is a perfect blend of an american- and eurostyle type of game and it definitely opens a new era of boardgaming!

Beautiful game.  The way you learn the game by playing instead of by reading the rulebook makes this game one of the best designed games ever. I enjoyed the puzzle style that makes you plan ahead all your moves.  You don't have to kill everyting on your path, but selectively decide who to spare.  In case I want to kill everything on my path, I’ll play Zombicide.

Legends of Andor is a beautiful game. Legends of Andor is a challenging game. Legends of Andor is not a fun game.

I was expecting a co-op adventure game. In reality, Legends of Andor is a demanding puzzle game. You must intricately manage your resources and actions to prevent the monsters from overrunning the kingdom.

It's not a bad game, I'm sure, but it wasn't what I was expecting.

RATING: 7
Fun cooperative fantasy game. It's more "cooperative" than "fantasy" though. So games don't last for hours and your job isn't to clear the board and eradicate loads of critters, but to pick and fight strategic battles to steal victory from the evil forces. There are no fancy armors and weapons, but the items you do have feel really powerful. Every fight pushes the clock forward and there is so much to do and so little time.

Even though there are no miniatures and they use cardboard standups, they are still gorgeous and can hold their own. They are painted from the front and back, so there is still a three-simendional quality to them when you see them on the board. The two-sided board is also beautifully drawn and shows a wide range of different landscapes. The only drawback is that the numbers on the spaces don't seem to follow any particular order so searching for a specific number can be slightly annoying.

Sold this after two plays.  The game was a pretty intriguing puzzle to solve, but nothing about it really wowed me, and since mine was an earlier edition with the translation errors, I didn't really feel like putting in the effort to print out references for those.  I'd still be willing to play the new, fixed edition, but won't be seeking it out.

Wow, very cool cooperative fantasy adventure that is more thematic than your typical move into the next room and kill stuff dungeon crawl. Taking a more strategic approach rather than a tactical miniature combat approach is refreshing. A very effective introductory rules set that teacher you the game as you learn but does leave out some details that requires you to check the reference book.

Storydriven coop adventure game with a very euroish feel, which might be a turnoff for those who are expecting a little bit more chaos and less puzzling. I really like the low-fantasy art in this game, and the fact that the male and female versions of each character look almost identical to the point that it is hard to tell them apart (this is really (and sadly) not the case with most adventure games).

The first scenario is a tutorial and should be regarded as such. The real game starts with the second scenario and then takes off fully with scenario 3 that offers true replayability through the random quests and setup. And scenario 4 has it's own mapboard!

One of the first modern board games I played. I thought it was an adventure game when I first bought it and didn't like it much. But since I have come to see that it is a cooperative puzzle game my opinion of it has gone up tremendously.

This is a game unlike any other I have experienced. Posing as your classical high-fantasy RPG/dungeon crawler, this is actually a very thematic and immersive coop puzzle adventure game. Even while including many of the genre's tropes, the realm of Andor feels fresh, vibrant, and ripe for adventure. The board is the most gorgeous I have ever seen, and it is double-sided! All the other components are just as beautiful, perfectly marrying functionality and aesthetics.

Kudos to Menzel for the learn-as-you-play approach: you can basically start playing after reading a simple one-page introduction to the rules. There are no mechanisms to counter quarterbacking, though, but it is otherwise a top-notch co-op experience. Just don't expect the game to be focused on combat, as its core is instead both the puzzle-y coordination of each hero's actions and the unraveling of the story itself. After the third scenario I decided I wanted to get the expansions, and even the website has plenty of extra content to download. Couldn't be more pleasantly surprised!

Initial rating after playing one legend.

This game is fun but it is presented in an odd way. The rules change for the scenario and then change again during the scenario and the rules are presented in little bite sized pieces. 

Half way through the first scenario the game starts getting pretty fun but the first half it was more chore than game. This game for me is the best representation of a board game / RPG and is a lot different than anything I have played before. 

The board/pieces/box everything looks great. I really appreciate the non-sexualized heroines. Its a box full of components (yay!). Wish the monsters were named with more traditional names. The monster dice seem to hate me.

Re-play value is quite high with the caveat that I might need user created scenarios after the ones supplied with the game.

Nem rossz játék bár egy Odalent után nem nyújt túl sok újdonságot. A hangulata jó, a feladatok se egyszerűek, és végülis jól eltalált az arány a kooperáció, és az önálló döntések között. Kicsit furcsa, hogy nem szabad legyakni a szörnyeket, mert akkor is idő előtt vesztünk, ezt kicsit koncepciómentesnek érzem. A játék persze gyönyörű. Szívesen végigjátszanám egyszer a küldetéseket.

Overrated. The game is fun and beautifully illustrated and sometimes it's even exciting. But all the grandesse boils down to a few dice throws at some point and to counting out where the monsters might jump to over another and that is just too profane to be a hit. I wished some epic sword fights. I got a puzzle game.

Decent adventure game, clean design and superb graphics. I'm not sure what makes it not a whole lot of fun to play. I want to like it but I can't.

The game has the worst possible rulebook. It just gives very basic information, spreading important rules on tiles/cards. Referencing or finding a rule you're not sure about is a nightmare, making the game hard to play. Wish it came with a compendium of some sorts, something that has every rule in one place and easily accessible.

Interesting coop game that approaches the issue from the narrative side. I'm not sure how successful it is: The first time through is pretty nice but I am not particularly motivated to retry scenarios I have already played (irrespective of whether I lost or won). The later scenarios try to improve replayability by including lots of random effects but those are kind of at odds with (and irreleveant to) the story being told and only attack the problem from a purely mechanical angle.

I'll settle for a rating somewhere between the better score for the first play-through and the significantly lower one for repeat plays of the same legends.

The concept & mechanics of this game are as appealing as the artwork is. Unfortunately, starting with legend 3 the games are almost unbeatable playing with only 2 heros in 2-Player mode - you simple don't have enough time -> you need to get extremely lucky to succeed in the legend. This makes the game suddenly less fun than the initial impressions promised...

We'll try to play the legends with 4 heros (2 each) from now, the rating might go up with that tweak.

 I am always impressed with someone whom can deliver the art, the design, the packaging and the game all on their own.
 
 This is one man's dream game. And it's a darn nice adventure game to boot. It's heavy on theme and story and puzzle elements(as it's a coop) with a clever fighting dice pool.  And light on much else. But what's here is very unique, interesting and worth a try.  A couple of the main campaign quests have random elements allowing for replayability.  But once the story is told. It's told.

Fun little game, felt a lot like playing a computer game. Has a lot of rules and our introductory game was pretty tiring. But it has a strong theme as a plus, plays really fast and is really simple after you get the hang of it. I generally prefer games with a simple ruleset and deep gameplay, but this one has a well-designed story to be played out and that kept me engaged. (Although I would prefer almost any other theme over the fantasy setting.) This however also means that I don't think I would ever want to replay any of the scenarios and we have already finished 3 out of 5 on our first try. But getting 10-12 hours of fun from a game is still decent.

Very tight and fun fantasy co-operative game that feels like a more family-oriented version of Defender of the Crown. I like the tutorial board feature; really makes learning the game a fun exercise (and much easier for the rules reader). It's so rare that a game that says "60 minutes" actually play exactly that :-) Awesome art also helps.

Feels like a watered down D&D.  It's a little too easy with four.  Production values are strong - great art, very thematic.  Kind of disposable game, only want to play each scenario a couple of times, at most.  Still a fun fantasy, co-op game.

I have played this a couple of times and found it an interesting mechanic for a cooperative game. The scenarios keep the game interesting for repeat playing, but I think once you've played each one, there's not as much to keep you interested. To me it relies a bit too much on the scenarios and flavour text.

It gets fairly same-y pretty quickly. Yes, you can play the 3rd scenario multiple times, but there will never be new special powers, new items, new interactions...
But the puzzle aspect of the game is still a lot of fun, and it's quick to teach and to play.
So it might not have the legs I would get with a bigger adventure game, but it's good for what it is.

Great game! I immensely enjoy it! I hope there will be a lot more legends and some more heroes coming out in the future!

Replayability of the first legends is sadly not that high, but the legend in the first expansion seems to improve in that aspect. :)

Ended up playing Legends of Andor and embarrassingly getting trounced twice in the first introductory scenario! Its likely playing a tutorial in a video game and getting a game over! Harsh harsh game, very puzzlely. Itching to try it again.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Not quite what you'd expect - this is not a fantasy adventure where you merrily go around, slay monsters and pick up treasure. Instead Legends of Andor is a fantasy-themed puzzle game where you try to figure out a way to solve the adventure with a limited amount of moves. It's unusual, but works beautifully. There is also enough randomness to ensure decent replayability: you can easily play each of the 6 legends through 2-4 times with different characters - and 15-20 plays is pretty good replayability for any game in my book.

Works also very well as a solo game.

RATING: 7
Nice mechanics and design, but very difficult. Either too many monsters enter the keep (= lose) or you fight too many monsters, which progresses the story teller too fast (= lose).

Elegant low-complexity fantasy co-op, clever rules lead-in make it easy to teach.  Concern about replayabilty - but at least you have 5 scenarios to play before you need to test how similar each one will play out a second time.

Played it once so far. I like it, but I'm not crazy about it. The game feels kind of puzzly at times, and I do not really enjoy the idea of getting punished for sucessfully killing monsters (I understand why it works like this gameplay-wise, but it still doesn't feel quite right for me).

I believe the best cooperative game i ve ever played and one of the best games for me in general!I m trying to recall the first two legends that we ve played and it was like having traveled in another world,all three of us had our own word in order to help and defend our position,such excitement all the time,just like being a part of a very exciting adventure film!hope for more and more legends in the future.... 
Thank you Mr Menzel!
 Edit:I started playing again the game from the beginning-with the 1st legend-it works amazingly with 2p too.
 Edit2:Started all over again after 8 months of finishing all 5 legends plus extra legend:Liberating the mine. Regarding replayability which is mentioned all the time,
for me it's like watching a film i love once more-each time discovering more details...
I tend to say it is the best game I have ever played-the feelings when playing are so intense,the epitomy of heart and brain in one game....Looking forward to playing all expansions,I thank my luck I already own!(except the last one...when will it be released in english?...)
Congratulations Michael Menzel!

Once you figure out how to play (worst rulebook ever), it's actually pretty smooth and enjoyable.  We really liked it, but I'm wondering about replayability.

UPDATE: I've tried to bring this game out on several occasions, but it's always with a new group, so I have to repeat Legend 1.  One time I tried starting new players in Legend 2 and there's just too much fussing around and they get lost right away, not understanding how the game mechanics flow together and the time track.  Given that I don't have a regular game group that is willing to learn and focus on this game and work through the missions, I decided I'm going to put it up for trade / sale, but not before my wife and I play through the 4 missions.

We got the game out tonight and I couldn't help but be annoyed at the setup... every time we pull this thing out it takes 20 minutes to read through all the setup.  We chose Legend 3, as both of us have completed Legends 1 and 2.  We probably made it 3 turns in and were both so annoyed at how fiddly everything is and how often I had to refer back to the rules to find out what herbs cost (oh, everything costs $2, okay), or that this guy moves twice, but not before this other guy moves, and what happens if I die in battle again?  There's just so much re-looking rules up that it pulls me out of the story constantly, and storytelling is supposed to be the game's strong suit.  It's just not for us.  Game is in perfect condition, all the parts are counted and bagged and ready for a new home.  If my son was 10 or 12 and wanted to play through this with me on summer vacation, I'd keep it.  But he's 2.  :P

This was a really interesting co-op game, but avoid the first legend if you are playing with gamers and explain the "missing rules" instead as usual. It's quicker to go through the rules instead of playing this too easy "solvable legend". On the other hand I thinks it's brilliant to play this with non-gamers instead of explaining the rules.

There is no fantasy co-op that comes close. "Cult of the new" players, who tend to only play a game twice and then trade it away, will get through the tutorial of this game, get frustrated, and tell you there's no replayability to the game. I am here to tell you that Legend 3, which alone features four different randomisable bosses, personal quests, and a 15 x 6 permutation of early-game monster distribution, contains more replayability than any other coop I've ever played.

RATING: 9.5
From the very best boardgame artist comes the best cooperative game I have ever played. One thing I really like is that there is a story that develops as you play, and it goes on across the various "legends" (scenarios). The potential for creating custom scenarios with your own stories is fantastic!

The mechanics are relatively simple and generally intuitive. The exception to the latter, of course, is that killing monsters advances the time counter. It works as a rule, but it is absolutely unthematic and sometimes a bit annoying. It adds to the feeling of solving a puzzle that the game provokes, which is not what people expect from adventure games. That is probably not a bad thing, as I'm so often disappointed by adventure games and enjoy this one.

A minor complaint: the need to defend the castle often causes the two-player game to devolve into one player taking this task and the other doing all the rest. Another problem is that there are too few scenarios (the alternate side of the board is only used by one of them) and expansions will be necessary to increase the game's longevity. But I would certainly buy them, anyway.

On the production, my only gripe is the choice of cardboard standups instead of plastic miniatures for the heroes and monsters. But that is comprehensible, given the designer's background as an artist. And being Michael Menzel's artwork on those standups surely reduces my discontentment.

I can't finish, however, without commenting on the presentation of the rules. It does not affect my rating, but the learn-as-you-play novelty, with essential rules on cards and the lack of a conventional rulebook, was a terrible idea. I like to read and learn all the rules before I can teach the game, not to mention to look them up if necessary, and this approach makes that impossible. To add insult to injury, the introductory scenario treats the players like morons, with the simplest of rules (such as flipping a token when you enter its space) written on tiles scattered across the board. I'm glad that Kosmos already recognized the mistake and made available an "extended rulebook", but this should have been in the box.

Mine. Regalo de 2014

Es un buen juego de "grupo de heroes", cooperativo, con buena ambientacion. Por la ambientacion y el modo de narrar la historia y de describir las normas es bastante adecuado para introducir en el genero, sobre todo a niños de unos 8-12 años. Por la dificultad no lo es tanto. 

aparte del tema del "no plastico", en mi opinion su mayor defecto es la dificultad elevada sobre todo provocada por la norma de "matar monstruo adelanta paso del narrador" y los marcadores de stats de los personajes se podrian mejorar sustancialmente. 

Es un buen juego, pero le falta un poco para ser magnifico.

This is an ok fantasy adventure co-op game that couldn't convince me. It works and can be fun and engaging at times, but I found it very boring. Just do this and that and try to kill the boss, that's it.

It's just too streamlined for an adventure game for my taste.

Excellent fun, even solo.  I love that you cannot simply kill all the bad guys.  Tough choices have to be made as to when and where you choose your battles. Each hero feels different enough... not as much variety as I would like, however.   I normally play this solo, controlling all 4 heroes.  The game length is just right.  Difficulty may be on the easier side, but one MUST make good choices to win this game.

Legends of Andor is a puzzle/co-op game, set in a Fantasy setting, and featuring not only the wonderful art of Michael Menzel, but his game design as well.

The game sets players up against measured threats, and limits their choices by scenario- sometimes the straightforward hack your way through method is not the best choice, and heroes may run out of time and lives trying to win by brute force.

After a 2-player play of the first scenario, I found it reasonably challenging, and it certainly dropped a surprise or two during the game play.

I am starting this Kennerspiel des Jahres Winner at a 7; if the next scenarios prove a bit more replayable I will be still more pleased.

On the whole this was a nice surprise for me.

Wow! Simply put, one of the best games I have played. I'm kicking myself for not owning it back when it came out, but at the same time ecstatic, because I purchased at the best time. Under the FFG brand , aka the "Ameritrash-expansion-dice-central" of the board game world, Legends of Andor got absolutely no love. It won the Kennerspiel 2013 but FFG was too busy milking out Arkham Horror expansions to give two turds about a sleeper hit they had on their hands. It seemed like many of its fans in North America, would never see any expansions/love to this game. 

Thankfully KOSMOS decided to do the English translation themselves and now many expansions, that the German market have been enjoying will see North American shores. The game has a strong Fantasy feel, almost Lords of the Rings-ish" as you and your partners work together to take on different Legends. The game has all the markings of a typical "Descent-style" fantasy but it is an entirely different beast altogether. The game is indeed more Euro, and scenarios are presented in more of a puzzle, that players have to solve to have a favorable outcome. Going full spartan mode, and charging and killing all your enemies costs you time and resources, and if you attempt it as so, you will quickly find yourselves losing. 

The game is definitely more brain than brawn, and that's why I love it. It has simple combat with dice mechanics, but the meat of the game is finding out the best course of action to take with your adventurers, each of which plays differently, to complete each scenario. The game ships with five scenarios, a few of which have variable setups. I own the Star shield expansion as well, which adds one new scenario with 6 different possible endings.

Good Coop, with a very tense feel. You will spend more time planning out the entire team's turn, than doing it. The storied scenarios, and varied character abilities really make this game drip with theme.

It's nice, but the puzzle you have to solve each game (which monsters do we let through to the castle, which ones can we afford to kill...) gets a bit repetitive and uninteresting.

Interesting coop, beautiful artwork. I don't think the game plays intuitively. You kinda want to kill all the enemies, but in doing so you lose precious time. You have to figure when and where to strike and focus your efforts. I'm not sure about 2-4 player balancing. Needs more plays.

Really like the puzzly feeling of it, yet one has to like the sometimes "limited" choices and the absolute need to play together as a team. The manual and explanations are quite bad though - even though there is a special intro Legend with its own explanations, there are many important explanations missing in those explanations, so to play it without confusion or errors you will have to read the complete manual from beginning to end - and that manual is not very well structured either. Ironically, that makes it much harder to get going with the first Legend, rather than easier.

Large Tolkien-style fantasy cooperative game, where you are fighting off waves of baddies to save the castle, all while completing side quests to further the story or get bonuses to help you.

You and your allies must move around the board, with a limited number of actions per day to use each.  At the end of each day, there may be some advancement of the story but there is always an event card which makes at least something happen.

The game definitely encourages cooperation and planning, you stand a much better chance against the enemies if you fight together, and you often need to take items across the board in tandem.  Also the spoils of victory can be distributed as you please, so this allows for more discussion and general collaboration.

I have only played 2 of the base game Legends so far, but both have been OK and I imagine that the other ones are more of the same.  My only complaints with this game really are that it seems to be relatively easy, and that the theme is completely generic and indistinguishable from other fantasy universes of its ilk.  A fun game though, and actually plays fairly quickly despite it's size and number of components.

Its really unique how you need to balance how many monsters you need to kill and work on the main missions.  You cant just slay all the monsters and complete the objectives. Some will need to be fought and some will get through your castle.  This is a hard game.

The puzzly co-op nature inevitably calls to mind the other co-ops.  The mechanics seem very nice overall (even the controversial killing-monsters-advances-the-legend-track thing; hey, it's a game, not a simulation). It seems that the legends don't scale well for two; it's much more enjoyable with the full complement of four players. We haven't managed to come close to completing legend two yet; with two it seems nigh on impossible (but, hell, maybe we just suck).

Beautiful bits and art, though.

RATING: 7
Very nice first outing for MM as designer here. Similar to Robinson in many ways (less the theme), which speaks well for it in my eyes. 

Robinson is the deeper more involved game with tougher decisions, this one is MUCH easier to learn and also easier play, but its definitely not all fluff like some have passed it off as, not at all and decisions are not [i]all[/i] obvious here, to put it in perspective Robinson is probably the deepest co-op on the market as of 2012, and I would say decisions are a little more thought provoking here than Pandemic. Pandemic and this (or even more so DOTR) also share some things so its another apt comparison. 

Both Robby and this have significant setup time as a negative, but LoA has VERY elegant rules overall, top marks for this, gameplay is pretty streamlined, not checking the rules every couple of turns like Robby... I think the story element comes through maybe a touch more in Robby, compared to others in the genre I would say LoA does quite well here also though, both are thick in theme but don't expect a Dungeon Crawl here, its not. 

The timer moving against you when you kill a Monster is kinda anti-thematic, depending on how you look at it, easy to see why he did it and not a deal-breaker for most I would think. Minis should would have been nice (and another scenario or two, replay suspect for sure)! Make sure you play past scenario one which is just a learning game.

Bokkensprong 18/12/2015. Coöperatief avonturenspel, kruising tussen Hero Quest, Risk,... De helden krijgen een opdracht die ze moeten vervullen per legende. Per beurt kan je een van beide acties doen: verplaatsen of vechten. Elke actie kost een uur op de tijdschaal; na zeven uur is de dag om en bewegen de monsters richting kasteel. Wordt het kasteel ingenomen, dan verliezen de helden. Vechten = dobbelen met x dobbelstenen, waarvan enkel de hoogste telt, en er je kracht bij optellen. Dit wordt vergeleken met het resultaat van de monsters; het verschil in score wordt afgetrokken van de wilskracht van de verliezer. Het volgende uur gaat de strijd zo verder. Monsters die op nul staan, zijn verslagen en leveren een beloning op; de legendemarker gaat daardoor echter ook wel vooruit.
Niet evident met vier; zeer moeilijk te winnen met twee! Lukt beter met wat ervaring.

RATING: 8
Fun, tense, puzzly co-op. I was convinced for most of the game that we had no chance, but the way that the game developed it ended up working out. It stacks things pretty heavily against you and it doesn't let up but it gives you opportunities to improve your situation and deal with ever escalating threats. It reminded me a bit of Robinson Crusoe in that way where you can be a bit proactive, as opposed to something like Pandemic which to me feels very reactive. I really liked how you can't just kill every monster you see because that will push up the time track and finish the game before you've accomplished all of the objectives. But at the same time the monsters are a very real threat and not killing the right ones will very quickly lose you the game. So you have to be very selective in which fights you take. Each adventurer also feels unique and fits the class they're supposed to be. Overall the theme came through pretty well for me.

I like it, but so far I feel like the missions are kind of scripted, i.e. if you don't go here, get this item, go over here and defeat this monster, you won't win.

Edit: After a couple more plays, I REALLY don't like the way the enemies move. It's hard to accurately predict their movement without staring at the board and calculating for 5 minutes. It often looks like you're in no danger at all, but then 5 enemies in a row do the chinese checkers jump and all of the sudden it's like, "Huh, I guess we lose." I'm lowering my rating from 7.5 to 5 because of this, it has completely ruined the last few games for me.

Mechanically simple when seen from a "gamers" point of view. But there's a lot to like in Andor: The scripted legends really make you feel that you're taking part in a proper story, rather than just running around bashing monsters. The components are great and of course the artwork is fantastic. My 8-year old son loves it. :)

The "turn marker" advances when you kill something" controversy is a non-issue for me, the trick is not to see it as a measure of time spent, but as an abstract "how far along in the adventure are we" marker - and progress in the adventure in this game mainly depends on the number of monsters killed.

With only five scenarios, one could worry about replayability, so here's hoping for lots and lots of expansions!

But for now we are enjoying this immensely! Excellent game, highly recommended.

More of a puzzle game than anything. Not one to play with friends that want to just run around and kill everything as you have to be VERY careful with how many things you kill in order to beat a scenario. Sometimes you have to kill enemies to advances the scenario, other times its best to ignore them or kill only what you need and let the rest slide by you.

If you can get past the painful setup process (IMO) then there's a really good game in there. It's an ameritrashy game that's not really ameritrash. It's "fantasy Pandemic" but also not really. What I can definitely say though is, it's quite difficult and losing because of some bad dice rolls can be quite crushing and discouraging. However, careful planning will pay off and when it does it's very satisfying.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (September 2015)

For some reason I didn’t want to play Legends of Andor, perhaps because it is a CoOp game and most games in this category have disappointed me. However I found myself in an uncommon situation, we were two players and only had games for three or more players so we had to play Legends of Andor or go home. Now I’m glad I did as the game surprised me.

The rules are pretty easy, but the decisions aren’t in any way obvious, Legends of Andor is a challenging game (as a good CoOp should be). There is some luck but you can mitigate it with clever play (group combat) or buying upgrades. I like how you spend “time” to get things done.

The game components are ok but the game art is very good. It also tells a good story, that is, it has a good theme that is in congruence with the game mechanisms. 

I think it is best with 4 players (although I haven’t played in that configuration).

What I really like about the game, is that the gameplay feels really different from most CoOps I have played, the reason is that you cannot kill monsters just because, as in most games (I always do that as I’m generally the tank). In Andor every time you kill a monster, the timer advances so you really have to think your moves/kills through. I’m impressed by this because it really adds a new dimension to the game (however this doesn’t make thematic sense to me and this is a minor flaw because the game is supposed to be thematic).

On the bad side, I’m not sure about the game replayability. Once I have successfully completed a legend, there is very little motivation for me to revisit it. I also would have loved that the legends were interconnected, but as I understood the game, each legend is independent (other than for storytelling purposes). 

Bottom line, I enjoy Legends of Andor and I’m open to playing all the legends, however, I think I won’t buy it because I feel the game has a very low replay value for me. Perhaps it is too simple for my current tastes.

It seems that 4th try is the charm, for a fantasy-themed coop. I traded Defenders of the Realm (too much like an overly long, anti-climactic Pandemic), traded Lord of the Rings LCG (did I really think I was going to spend all that money on expansion packs?), traded Wrath of Ashardalon (too random, too un-thematic, no interesting decisions). Legends of Andor is much better than all of those: interesting decisions, interesting discussion among players, amazing artwork, and generally polished gameplay. Highly, highly recommended.

UPDATE: Upped my rating after playing some more, there is a lot going on in later legends, and it is HARD. Don't play with people who don't take a bad roll of the die well./UPDATE 

Good coop. A mix between Defenders of the Realm (I have not played that yet though, but both has a theme of monsters moving towards your castle) and Mice and Mystics (with the story track and storytelling elements. Feels very much like its own game, mind you, works very well. It could go higher as we get into the later legends, I miss some more special player actions rather than move or fight. Components are top notch, the artwork sets a mood for the Andor universe, I just wish the dice weren't so damn small. They are probably perfect for kids though, and the game is much less language dependant than M&M. This is a better family game for non-english speakers

I went into this with high hopes as an adventure game that I could play at equal footing with the kids (12 and 7). In that very specific goal, it somewhat succeeds. For some, I believe that is enough. For me, it turns out, it isn't. 

First off, the 14+ age on the box is a total joke. This is a 10+ game, and playable down to age 7 with some help. In fact, there is not enough tension or interesting decisions in this game to make it anything other than a game you play with your kids. I can't imagine sitting around a table of adults to play this.

My caveat is that I only played the first three legends, but I have no interest in going further. 

What did I like? I do like the fact I can play it with my kids. I think that the mechanics are smooth and make sense.

What do I feel ambivalent about? The game pieces out the rules to you in the legends as you play them. This gets you playing fast, but also leaves you too much in the dark about why it is you are even playing the game. For those who are not used to playing gamer games or learning from rulebooks, it's probably good. For those of us who eat rule books for breakfast, it gives you the sense of feeling around in the dark and is frustrating. A rule book, called a "reference book" is included, but you almost feel guilty reading it, as if it is going to give away some great reveal that will come in a later legend. This style of game teaching is certainly not for me, but it isn't necessarily a bad thing.

What don't I like? The first two legends were WAY too easy. I gave the first one a pass for being an intro, but we won the second legend with 3 days to spare. That is a lot of time! In both legends we defeated the enemies in one day and had two days or so with nothing to do before the next legend card introduced anything new. It is easy to gain strength and willpower and very hard to lose it. While I appreciate that the events are not too powerful and random, they have so little impact as to be practically meaningless. 

Never in our games did anybody feel threatened by anything. Our decisions were obvious, once the game decided to let us know what to do. Even if future legends get harder, which I am sure they do, I don't see much room for the game to get any more interesting. With only 5 legends in the box, replayability would appear to be a major, major issue as well. I could never imagine wanting to play any of these again after playing them through once.

A really big miss, in my opinion, is the story aspect, which should be this game's core strength. I found nothing to care about in the story. No real characters. The legend cards had two sentences of story and 3 paragraphs of instructions. Nothing about them felt legendary in any way!

What did my kids think? (Maybe that is the most important aspect here?) They didn't dislike it, but neither did they ask to play it again. I had to make strong suggestions to get them to do Legend 2. If my kids fell in love, that would be enough for me to call this a sure keeper. But that didn't happen.

Outside of having an adventure game that you can play at equal footing with your kids, I can't see anything much to recommend this game. And honestly, my kids get far more excited about playing the venerable Mystic Wood than Legends of Andor!

This game is pretty mediocre really... for a fantasy game, some stuff just doesn't make any thematic sense such as monsters being able to melee you while you shoot your bow at a location "1 hour away by foot".

The game itself is pretty boring because it's too easy and repetitive... there's only a few items you can buy that are the same every time so you don't get the feeling of excitement from pulling random loot from a deck like in other games of the genre.

After the initial legend I thought this is fun. We had borrowed the game and we had some more time so we continued playing legends 2 and 3. While more elements were added and the legends got longer and harder, the experience didn't change enough to maintain the tension. The same battles, the same strategies. While a single game from time to time would be fine for usual games, it doesn't work too well with this game concept of learning on the fly which lives from progressing through the legends with an equally experienced group learning new elements together. It's similar to Space Alert in this respect. Not sure about replayability either as the variables in each scenario don't change the basic strategy. Nonetheless, unique enough to give it a few tries and I'm sure fans of cooperative games and fantasy might get their money's worth.

After playing it a little bit more, I've come to a conclusion that this is a brilliantly made game. I love that it has more going on than just "slay all the bad guys" which is typical within the genre. 

It's simple, but offers reasonable challenge.

RATING: 8.5
Really enjoying this game. Players take on the role of heroes with multiple objectives. Every turn, monsters move closer to the castle and players must stop them while trying to finish their quests cooperatively.

Production values are good, the cardboard standees are among the best I've seen, although I felt it was a waste to have so much Legend-specific cardboard chits for the introductory Legend. Also, the rules are quite poorly organized.

No en la primera vez que lo juego y para mi gusto el mejor juego cooperativo que existe. Por el tema por las ilustración y por que en realidad supone un gran reto poder salir victoriosos. Es muy amigable la manera introductoria en la que te introduce el mismo juego en las reglas y la mecánica. 10 31/10/2014

A very pretty co-operative game that rarely comes out. The concepts within are very nicely executed, but... the game can be INCREDIBLY challenging. In some scenarios it appears close to impossible within the first few moves and a handful of the legends are not that entertaining within that respect.

Love this game. A little committing timewise but in all other ways, the perfect game for me. I have played this with my regular group, they love it. I have played it with my six year old and he loves it. The theme is a bit derivative but I really think the game is nearly perfect. With so many fan contributions as well to print and play it just seems like a game that keeps giving and giving. Update: Recenly played Legend 5 and it took the shine off the game for me a bit. Super tough boss with not much ability to gear up properly because of the whole kill-a-monster-move-the-pawn process.

Chez nous le jeu est un grand succès avec les enfants qui en redemandent! Par contre il faut savoir que ce n'est pas un "hack and slash", il ne faut pas s'attendre à tuer tous les monstres et ramasser plein de trésors et monter de niveau. Pour cela je regarderais plutôt un jeu comme Heroquest ou Heroscape. Andor est un casse-tête avec un thème d'aventure très bien senti. La gestion du temps provoque un sentiment de stress qui immerse totalement les enfants (pleurs de défaite et cris de victoire, pipis en urgence parce qu'ils se retiennent pour ne rien manquer). C'est un des jeux où la collaboration est vraiment nécessaire, si un joueur fait un tour sans considérer les autres ça met tout le monde en péril.

Un conseil essentiel pour réussir les missions: il ne faut pas essayer de battre les monstres avec juste un personnage, il faut toujours se mettre au moins deux, même pour les monstres les moins forts. On sauve énormément de temps de cette façon.

La puissance des scénarios varie avec le nombre de joueurs, on peut jouer de 2 à 4, et aussi à 2 avec 2 personnages chacun, ce n'est pas difficile à gérer. J'ai une préférence pour 3 ou 4 personnages à la fois.

Nous jouons avec les enfants, mais le niveau de difficulté est élevé, il faut un peu d'aide des adultes pour encadrer les décisions (sans que l'on joue à leur place non plus)

This is a fast-paced well-done co-op fantasy game with an interesting tutorial system that has you start playing immediately... however, if you want to find a rule later on you may have to sift through the cards again to find it, since there is no real rulebook in the box... strange!

RATING: 7
Generic fantasy theme with beautiful artwork. Very specific approach to fighting.  You can safely walk by monsters and withdraw from any fight, also fighting is penalized by time left consumption. So fighting has to be carefully planned - where, when and how, making it more like a strategic game than the adventure. The main drawback is not many scenarios and characters included (5 scenarios, 4 characters). If you like careful planning instead of happy slaughtering of the monsters, give it a try.

I don't know who has influenced Mr. Menzel create directly this story, not zombies or aliens, but I assume that it partially comes from German folklore and literature. When playing Legends of Andor I feel like reading German or Norwegian and of course my - Latvian fairy tales. It's a great feeling!
And music of Carl Maria von Weber's "Der Freischütz" is playing in my head. :)

An enjoyable game that plays very well with four Heroes whether they are controlled by one or more human players. Certain missions/Legends can prove near impossible to compete with less than three Heroes. Very well suited for solitaire play but you would probably need to control  three or four Heroes.

Worth to play to experience the story it presents.
The biggest negative is that you can get so messed up by your rolls at the start of the game that you loose it purely by the luck of the rolls. This was the only game where I did not enjoy to play as a dwarf for the skill appears to be difficult to use.

I got to enjoy it much more the second time I played it. This shows that experience helps to win the game, which is a positive.

Go grab one yourself, just be ready for a lot of reading. This way it feels similar to an RPG, again a positive :)

Cooperative storytelling in a light manner. Players can play as one of four different classes with a male/female counterpart for each class. The game ships with 6 legends. I have only played 3 so far, however, what I have played has not been insanely challenging. The formula works, however, as players spend time collecting resources, increasing their strength, and waging battle against four different monster types: Gor, Skraal, Troll, and Wardrak, with extra additional bad guys in the game. If you enjoy dungeon delving and story telling this is a pretty good and thematic game. I'm not sure on replayability, and I think the game suffers because of it. This game should be an 8, but from what I played it seems like there isn't enough to continually play it. Hopefully more content is released with additional legends, but I'm sure it will be costly. As it is a solid 7.

Legends of Andor is a cooperative adventure board game for two to four players in which a band of heroes must work together to defend a fantasy realm from invading hordes. To secure Andor's borders, the heroes will embark on dangerous quests over the course of five unique scenarios (as well as a final scenario created by the players themselves). But as the clever game system keeps monsters on the march toward the castle, the players must balance their priorities carefully.

Almost really more a puzzle than a game. It can be very tough and forces a very balanced approach not always easy to discern. You can't go around killing every monster.

Nice gateway introduction to the cooperative fantasy adventure genre; although the videogame-style tutorial is something you need to get used to first, it works quite fine, and even the introductory game got tense and needed lots of cooperation by the end. 
After legends 2, 3 and 4 I like it even more. It seems these legends offer more variety as well, although it seems to be obvious that each legend is best when you play them first. So yes, there are replayability issues. But I enjoyed each of the legends until now pretty much. Excitement, rooting for luck (we were quite lucky to win!), lots of cooperation, it's fun!

It’s difficult to approach this as something other than just a puzzle. I assume moving the pawn for every kill is what makes it too mechanical and I wonder if it could have been made more exciting if each new event was drawn at the end of a day…? It tries with the narrative, but I couldn’t engage in the characters or their world at all.

A good experiment but nothing particulary exciting. The use of doublesided chits is excellent, though.

A really interested scenario-driven fantasy game.  It's a co-operative game that feels a little bit like an automated RPG with the game system triggering "scenario points" to moves the heroes forward towards a finale.  And, if the players fail, they can play the same episode or scenario again since it will have variability with each sceanrio.

The game is okay. Some plays were really fun, others were not. At all. I do not like, that you have very little freedom. It is a game on rails with a lot of random factors.

Uno de mis favoritos, sin duda. Es difícil, sí, y me gusta. Requiere una gran coordinación y compenetración entre los jugadores para optar a las escasas posibilidades de victoria que ofrece, y eso sí la diosa fortuna no te da la espalda en tirada de dados y cartas de evento, porque en ese caso ya sí que puedes ir dando la partida por perdida...
Me encanta!!

A veces tardas más en montar el tablero de juego que lo que tardas en perder la partida. Es un poco frustrante, pero un reto a superar. 
No es un juego apto para jugadores de paso, es para jugones con paciencia y capacidad de análisis, ya que hay muchos factores a tener en cuenta y cualquier despiste puede llevarte a la derrota fácilmente.
Me encanta++

This is definitely a more puzzle-based adventure where time management is key rather than say a dungeon crawl. The action points causing some people to have fewer turns per day than other people feels a bit odd but since days are generally pretty short anyways it's not a huge deal. Combat feels like a good balance of not being predetermined and yet not being too luck-based, and I like how the heroes use their dice in combat differently, although team battle seems really strong.

The basic mechanics of this game are pretty simple. Teaching the game via a tutorial legend was a little bit strange, and I feel like telling me all the rules that are used in the first legend right off the bat in a normal rule book format would have been easier than walking me through different parts as the legend progressed. I did like how the tutorial legend took out some of the extra-detail rules though, as I foresee it making this game a lot easier to teach to nongamers.

I've seen some comments of people saying they didn't like this game because you want to avoid killing stuff as much as possible. While it is true that you can purposely let a couple of monsters slip past, you still have to kill the majority of monsters and/or rush to the end condition quickly, and so combat is still very important, you just have to fight in a time-efficient manner. 

There are some very thematic little quirks in this game that makes it feel like it is going the extra mile. For example, there is an event card that causes a howling wind to hurt everyone in spaces 1-20. Seemingly random within this region of the board is a space numbered in the 70's, but on this space there is a picture of a house, indicating you weathered the storm by taking shelter.

The story in the legends while not having a huge amount of flavor text is cohesive and at least in my limited plays so far makes each legend feel unique. Setup time is a bit long.

Haven't played the last legend yet, but of the first 4 the game is pretty easy, which is probably its biggest flaw (barring a special surprise in one of the legend 3 final encounters). While Legend 4's setup looks initially impossible it actually isn't too bad. Legend 3 and 4 feel very different and since 3 plays differently every time, it adds a lot of variety to the game, although I think for the most part it dwarfs Legend 2. While I am disappointed that this game isn't smacking me in the face with difficulty every time I still have a blast playing it, and for that alone have to give it a solid 8.

EDIT: Well I did finish all the legends a long time ago, but realized recently I had been playing the advance the legend track after defeating a monster wrong. While I feared this lack of integration of game balance with thematic sense would be really bad, aftwr playing it again the fact you still have to kill a decent number of stuff makes me not dislike it that much, and I definitely like that the game is more difficult with the correct rules.

A great cooperative game the whole family loves. It is hard and the set up is long, as well as the playing time but the gameplay and rpg feel make up for that. Love the artwork and the characters especially because you can choose male or female side of character card. A hit for us!

I'll get this out of the way first: I absolutely hated the tutorial style they used to teach the game. It did not work for me at all, and I kept wanting to have a traditional rulebook. As it was, there was no way to go back and have a reference to check on specific rules.

The rest of the game: the generic fantasy theme was bland and uninspired. The game itself felt like a puzzle that had be solved exactly right, and the only variation was on the fog tokens. I don't like dungeon crawlers and wasn't expecting that (which is one thing a lot of people complain about), but the game ended up being not fun for us. I wanted something more free form, with more collaboration and more creativity.

I'm adjusting this one down a lot after a few more plays.

The theme of this game almost feels like false advertising.  It looks like an RPG-lite game about character development and combat.  It's really a euro-style race game where you're cooperatively trying to figure out a movement puzzle to beat a "you lose" timer that is constantly pissing you off due to the fact that it goes down every time you kill a monster.

BUT I WANTED TO KILL THE DAMN MONSTERS!!!......

First and foremost, I love fantasy games and I particularly love Michael Menzel's artwork. He is my favorite board game artist.  However, for this game he is also designer and I really like what he's done mechanically with this game.  It is a cooperative but is also very tight and feels a bit like a Euro while playing it.  I love pretty much everything about it and am always up for playing it.

The game is too slow and tutorial driven. Fantasy RPG with co op game play. I understand what the game is trying to provide to the user experience, but it is just not for me.

This is a fun game. The quests kind of jump on you so far but that feels right. Only played the intro solo so far but I like this. Good puzzle coop.

Now played intro again with 4 players and it is a lot of fun. Sat down and worked out how to do the scenario. Discussion was a lot of fun to do and the timing and choices were good. In the first scenario, it is a little problematic that you do not realise that the killings you do are pushing the time track a long and it is slightly alien to not be able to delay the monsters - you just have to kill them.

Good fun.

Update after three scenarios conquered (six plays): rules are indeed fairly simple and the scenarios have more or less the right challenge level. I'm not too fond of having to let some of the bad guys run unopposed (it just feels wrong), but it's already hard enough to get all the objectives done in time.

Das mit Abstand "fitzeligste" Spiel in meiner Sammlung. Ich finde es sehr unpraktisch und schade, dass fast alles mit Papp-Plättchen dargestellt wird, was zumindest teilweise auch viel einfacher und praktikabler über Karten hätte gemacht werden können. So schön das ganze dann auch ausschaut, unter anderem dadurch braucht das Spiel zum Aufbauen sogar deutlich länger als zum Beispiel Eldritch Horror (habe spaßeshalber beim Aufbau des Sternenschilds letztens mitgestoppt, und mit dem Abhandeln der Legendenkarten A1-A4 waren es fast 30 Minuten bis zum ersten Spielerzug). Da das Spiel dann aber eigentlich gar nicht so lang dauert, hat es eines der schlechtesten Verhältnisse von Aufbauzeit zu Spielzeit in meiner Sammlung. Auch die Tatsache, dass dann viele Spielrelevante Informationen und Regeln über verschiedenste Legendenkarten verteilt stehen, nach denen man im Zweifelsfall umständlich suchen muss, kostet wertvolle Spielzeit und fühlt sich einfach nur nervig an. Wegen dieser Mängel, die mich teilweise auch wirklich davon abhalten es zu spielen, leider "nur" knappe 7 Punkte (wären sonst locker 8).

Coops are not my thing, so it is debatable how much sense it makes for me to rate them. Nevertheless, I can appreciate good stuff even in games that I'm not that much interested in myself. And what strikes me the most about Andor is how obviously it is a labor of love.

And if you're a brilliant game illustrator, making a game your labor of love will be quite visible, of course, but there is a lot of ideas and detail packed into the game itself, too. The impact that bloodshed has on the game clock is one example of that, forcing you to carefully weigh when and which opponents to kill.

I've only played the first two legends so far, and I'd not be averse to try the 2nd one again, or delve deeper into the Legends of Andor. Which, from me, is high praise for a coop game, so if you like that kind of gaming, this is definitely recommended.

It's difficult to explain why we traded this one away. The story element really appealed to me. I think what it came down to is that we didn't like the game play. It felt like a lot of running around and killing things by rolling dice. That's not really what we like in a cooperative game.

A lot of ideas in this game are nice, but I also find several things that I really don't like about it.
1) It is too simple and the artwork does not drag you into the theme enough. It has probably too much of a family game for me. 
2) You have only a small number of playable setups, which are essentially exhausted after mastering them. 
3) The mechanism of how a game ends does not fit the theme. In the end of each game, you try to avoid killing more monsters because they will move the time counter forward and end the game before you can finish the quests. So you rather let the monster army approach the stronghold and let maybe even some enter.

Das Kennerspiel des Jahres: Ein optisch umwerfendes Koop in einer eigens kreierten Fantasywelt. Der Glücksfaktor ist überchaubar gehalten. Man spielt sich durch mehrer Kapitel einer Story, die in den beiden Folgespielen weiter geführt wird. Dabei ist auch ein Einführungskapitel enthalten, dass einen schnell in die Mechanismen des Spiels einführt, ohne dass langes Regellesen vorher nötig wäre. Die Schwierigkeit der einzelnen Kapitel steigt dabei immer weiter an, sodass man später durchaus mehrere Versuche zum Lösen benötigt.

RATING: 6
Legends of Andor is a fantasy based co-op game with a euro bent.  In it players are trying to defend the castle of Andor from hoards of invading creatures, while also attempting to complete side missions.

The game is very innovative in that it is episode based, and the episodes teach you the game as you go.  In particular episode one, or rather legend one, teaches placement of pieces out on the board, and how they are used, etc.  Another innovation is that the game uses two time tracks.  One track shows you how much time you have left in a day, or round.  The other one shows how many rounds are left before the game ends.  It's this second track that posses a great problem for players.  You see, as the monsters steadily march toward the castle only a small number can get in before the castle is overrun.  If it is ever overrun the players lose.  So, you must kill monsters off.  However, every time you kill a monster it advances the round track, leaving players with fewer rounds to accomplish their goals.  So, when it comes to killing monsters you're damned if you do, and damned if you don't.  This aspect of the game makes Legends of Andor very difficult to win.  The game is essentially a giant moving puzzle where players must work against time, and space, to do all the things they need to do.

Legends of Andor sports maybe the most beautiful game board ever created.  It is a sprawling vista of the land of Andor - on one side.  The other side depicts the underground caves that exist beneath the mountains.  All the pieces, in fact, are very well rendered.

I like Legends of Andor.  I wish I loved it, but I don't.  It all comes down to that round track.  I feel like the game is cheating me.  I have no choice but to kill monsters to protect the castle, but every time I do the game takes another round away from me in which to complete my mission(s).  Bad form, I say.  Bad form.

I've only played it a few times and only as 2 players but each time left me feeling "that's it?". The combat is really weak in my opinion and it feels more puzzle-y than a good fantasy adventure.

Cooperative game. The game has potential for ample replay, and we probably would have very impressed when it first came out in 2012, but we have had such a slew of great co-op games in recent years -- Sentinels of the Multiverse, Gloomhaven, Spirit Island, etc. -- that it has been robbed of a bit of its shine. Nevertheless, there are lots of fan-made legends to try and it offers got a good amount of tactical and strategic options.

Based on the first scenario ("legend"), this is so random it hurts (and I normally do not mind random). I think the main reason I detest it here is almost the same story will unfold. You see, on one hand this tries to be a story-driven game with randomized combat, on the other hand it wants to be a (hard, it seems) euro-inspired puzzle. That does not mix well.
And to make it worse it does not scale well to 2 players. At least not in the first scenario.

The worst part though is, at the middle of the scenario something happens in the story which changes the win/loose criterias. So I have to adapt, but at this point it was clear that the scenario is unwinnable based due to my previous choices *which were made without this knowledge*. So the only way I can win this is to replay, having knowledge about how the story will unfold. This, to me, is a major design flaw. If they want to make a changing story I should not have to know what will happen in order to win.

And what is up with the abstraction? Whenever I win a battle against a create I have 1 less day to complete my mission. Really? So, just to be clear, character A is running all he can in the east trying to deliver a message, hoping character B, who is in the west, will not battle a creature, thus depriving him of important running time. Yeah, that does not make sense.

If I want a fantasy game I will prefer to look elsewhere (although there is too far between good coop fantasy games), and if I prefer a puzzle I can definitely find it elsewhere. All in all this is a title to avoid for me.

- Stay away if you despise cooperative games and Fantasy settings!

- Try it at least twice if you like fantasy, but don't like coop games too much.

- It's a must have if you like coop games and have no problem with Fantasy settings.

Due to many variables in later "Legends" (scenarios) there is a lot of replayability (this is nothing you just "solve" and then move on).

My son wanted to play a cooperative fantasy themed game. This one also incorporates euro/puzzle like mechanics that also make this interesting for me. In addition, the art work and progressive scenarios are top notch. After you play through them you will be tempted to go onto the expansions, so its somewhat limited replayability might be a negative for people who enjoy, and have the opportunity, of playing the same game many times.

Cooperative game full of tension and really surprising.  I wasn't waiting for anything and this game pleasantly let itself discovered.  The game play is all about managing time and coordinating the team effort.  It reminds me a lot of the mechanism fort the tome un Thèbes.  The first quest is quite easy but the difficulty ramp up pretty quickly.  To play again for sure.

The ideal cooperative game for those who appreciate a High Fantasy theme done right. Too often the writing and ideas used to generate these games are hackneyed and clearly traceable to a specific author -- making this game a welcome find.

It feels like a Pandemic kind of co-op puzzle game, while the components could make you think it's a bit of a dungeon crawl. Given what's in the box and all, I'm actually disappointed there are only 5 Legends. Legend 3 seems to be the actual core of the game, with randomizers to make it replayable.

A co-op game that teaches you how to play as you start playing it. Sounds like a great way to teach the game but for me/us it didn't work. It left us confused as to what were the rules, and what was special case for the scenario more than once.

Gameplay in general is awkward and a bit weird, but interesting once you get the hang of it. It's kind of like a puzzle that you have to figure out how to solve in as few steps as possible.

[u]21-May-2013[/u]:  I probably shouldn't rate this one yet as I've only played the first Legend so far, but I really liked what I saw.  This is another one of my co-op games that I'll probably play only solo.  You are a group of standard fantasy heroes who must complete Legend specific quests before the Castle is overrun by monsters or the time track reaches its end.

There is combat in the game, but the main focus is the questing.  And I like that.  I've got Gears of War and Death Angel for combat games.  I wanted an adventure game, and I think this is a good one.  Again, I've only played the basic / learning Legend so far.  I am assuming things will only go up from here.

Oh, and the components are fantastic.  The artwork is beautiful.  Especially the double sided board.  It comes with cardboard standies, but I don't find them a problem in the least.  And, you can play the male or female version of your character...a nice touch indeed.

I'll probably have more to say after I get more into this one, but at this point, I'd say this is a great adventure game.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]:  Well, I finally played the second scenario...once.  I think this game is pretty sweet.  It's an adventure quest game with a good narrative feel to it.  Not having a traditional rulebook, I think, is what holds this game back for most people.  And that's a shame.  It's really fun and puzzle-y and beautiful to look at.

Este juego me gusto bastante. Al principio queria comprarme el Defenders of the Realms pero no lo podia conseguir en Mexico, asi que vi esta otra opcion, la investigue, me anime a comprarlo, y me encanto el juego. 

Creo que el juego no tiene una mejor calificacion en BGG por detalles como el hecho de que las piezas de criaturas y heroes no son de plastico, ademas vienen pocas aventuras, pero la verdad si comparas el precio de este con otros juegos del tipo con piezas de plastico y mas componentes, el precio se sube como al doble o casi. 

En cuanto a rejugabilidad, es cierto que tiene pocas aventuras, pero algunas de estas aventuras se pueden volver a jugar muchas veces por el azar que ofrecen algunos componentes que hacen cada juego distinto. Ademas se pueden crear aventuras propias, se pueden sacar de internet, y ademas hay y saldran nuevas expansiones.

Una mecanica que a algunos no les gusto es la del narrador, sin embargo a mi especialmente por eso es por lo que me gusta tanto el juego, ya que le agrega estrategia, te hace pensar que criaturas es necesario matar y cuales no,y calcular los movimientos de tus rondas, y no solo agarrarte matando criaturas para hacerte fuerte y pasar facilmente la mision, aparte eso mismo hace que no se alarguen tanto las partidas, lo cual para mi es de agradecer..

RATING: 6
A fun experience but isn't a great co-op - more suited to solo play due to the high chance of the Alpha player

After two solo plays and two co-ops, this is definitely a game that CAN suffer to the quarterback (it is very puzzle'y).  That said, there is the possibility that it can be overcome by not thinking about it too much or not allowing others to tell the current player what to do

In any event, it is a good game that I think is fun to play through as many Legends as possible due to the story, but it isn't something that you would want to replay

Other issues the game has is the high luck factor, with the outcome of battle being decided on dice (with some mitigation when performing a team battle or with high strength) or the draw of event cards

What a strange game. Even after reading multiple reviews of it the first game defied expectation. At its heart Andor is a solid if traditional co-op experience. It's the extra stuff that draws me in as a player- the small exploration aspect of the fog, the paper-doll inventory, the steady alterations to narrative and mechanics that happen as a result of the legend cards. Not to mention the weird obsession with wells. This one went from trade-bait to trying to track down the German expansions in four games. A keeper.

Beautiful board and bits. Relaxing, if somewhat fiddly, to play with the right crowd.  Some will likely gripe at the weirdness of the clock advancing with monster death, or the blandness of the hero archetypes.  I think it's just space for imaginative elaborations: narrative-within-the-narrative can abound here if you let it.  Can't comment on replay value, as I've yet to play all 5 scenarios--played 1-3 with various groups, all of whom had at least a good time.

score based on 1st play of legend 1 & 2. Great theme. Involving story and its not goblins and orcs for once !
legend 1 eases you in. Legend 2 drops you in an acid vat. very tough due to the kill the ever approaching monsters and be penalized by advancing the legend, or I as like to call it - reach the end of this and your screwed track. on 1st impressions this mechanics seems to really unbalance the game sadly as this oozes potential. score may improve

Only finished the 1st legend together with my 6-year old son - we needed 4 tries to win eventually. My son really likes the game and how we need to manage to kill the gors and skral monsters and complete the goal before the narrator finished the story. Killing too much monsters advances the story teller too much so it becomes a balancing act between how much monsters can you let enter the fortress and which ones do you need to slaughter. Rating might go up when we finish more legends.

I have played this a game a couple times. It took about 5 plays or so to complete the introduction. 

I really didn't enjoy the game. It seems like you need a specific way to complete each adventure and if you make one mistake then the adventure is ruined.

I will try to play again to see if the rating improves, but this doesn't come to the table often enough.

Die Legenden von Andor ist ein kooperatives Spiel mit klassischem Fantasysetting. Die Spieler verkörpern die Rolle von Fantasyhelden, dabei werden die genretypischen Klischees bedient: Zwerg, Krieger, Magier und Bogescnhütze stehen zur Auswahl Die Erweiterung "Neue Helden", sei hier direkt Denjenigen ans Herz gelegt, die mehr Abwechslung bei der Heldenauswahl haben möchte. Nachdem jeder Spieler einen Helden ausgewählt hat, geht es mit dem Einführungsspiel los und man lernt die grundlegenden Mechaniken kennen. An dieser Stelle sei direkt die Anleitung kritisiert: Diese ist so auf den schnellen und unkomplizierten Start ausgelegt, dass es durchaus offene Fragen gibt. Die Mechaniken von Andor sind gut durchdacht und greifen sinnig ineinander. Dabei ist es für die Helden wahrlich kein Zuckerschlecken das Zielzu erreichen. Der Schwierigkeitsgrad ist durchaus knackig und die Aktionen derHelden wollen gut überlegt sein. Natürlich spielt auch das Glück eine sehr große Rolle, denn wenn die Würfel beim heldenangriff partout nur wenig Augen zeigen wollen, rückt der Sieg in weite Ferne. Die Szenarien und die gesamte Geschichte werden dabei stimmungsvoll erzählt und schaffen eine tolle Atmosphäre. Als Fan von kooperativen Spielen, sollte man Andor mal gespielt haben.

Pro:
- Very thematic RPG
- In comparison to Mage Knight it actually feels like playing a real story. Mage Knight on the other hand is more of a "you are a hero and now you may run around looking for adventures to come".

- To make the first Legend as a tutorial-like introduction into the game mechanics is genious.

This game is pretty weird. You're "bad-ass" fantasy heroes, but if you kill too many enemies you lose?... This is one of those games where I feel like theme and game play are completely out of sync. Sure, it is an interesting puzzle to solve, but don't punish me in a fantasy game for killing stuff!

Also, you can only really play through the game once. This is not a game I would buy.

I love this euro-style thematic co-op. It is super challenging and there is definitely a lot of luck involved, but the puzzle aspect has a lot of appeal and combat doesn't overtake the gameplay. The tutorial style rules make this game easy to learn, but are not easy to navigate when trying to find specific information that you may have forgotten between plays. The one thing I really wish is that the characters were persistent, well that and it would have been lovely to have minis instead of standees.

I really dislike the fact that the narrator moves forward for each monster killed. I find it unthematic.
Plus, it would have been easy when playtesting the scenarios to adjust the difficulty (because just not advancing the narrator would make the game just too easy).

That makes andor a not very fun neither adventurous game.
But it makes it an interesting puzzle game, which is best solo-played for me.

This is one of my favorites. Has a progressive dungeon crawler aspect, but is HARD to beat, especially in later missions. Lots of "one wrong move and the whole thing goes down" issues, which leads to sometimes heated conversations about the best possible strategy. Fun stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this 2-4 player cooperative dungeon crawl game, players take on a particular scenario, trying to prevent monsters from overrunning their castle, and meeting the victory conditions. The players slowly learn about the requirements of what they have to do as the game evolves.

Players have seven hours in a day, in which 1 hour represents 1 movement point which they can use to move and fight. Players can gain strength and other items by trading in gold. Players can earn willpower (represents how many dice you roll in combat) and gold by defeating monsters, but each monster you defeat shortens the game by one turn. The combat is fairly streamlined, and you can get dice bonuses with helms or witches brew. 

It's a refreshing game in the sense that the quest you play will be new the first time you play it. It's really fun and really makes you work together. I'm looking forward to more plays.

It looks like a Dungeon Crawler but it's not - it's a Euro game that's an efficiency puzzle at its core.

A very good coop game. I like the fact that you should be attentive not to kill too much monsters otherwise the end will come nearer. It's nice to discover for the first time the legends.

A superb game on many levels... The theme and dice rolling belies the puzzley nature of the game. The rules are learned during the course of play, almost seamlessly. The narratives that unfold during the game not only tell a compelling story but also shift the course of your objectives in the middle of the scenario, ratcheting up the always-present time-pressure.

To my mind, this is superior to the current hot game duo of Pandemic Legacy and T.I.M.E Stories, trumping both in terms of unique mechanisms, replay value, and immersion. Really nice looking to boot.

Love the coop nature of the game. Great for discussions. I would be selective in who you pay with. You don't want to have one person who dominates all decisions or someone who gets frustrated by not having a voice. I am on legend 4/5 (probably 7 games in) and it has been great. I would recommend the hard difficulty. While I love this game thus far I do wonder about replay value. However, with the expansions and homebrew legends I think it is well worth the money.

El juego es muy emocionante y respira molancia, pero sin el genio de mi cuñado en el grupo nos pudriríamos a las puertas del castillo. El juego es difícil, además tenemos una suerte miserable, pero cambiando ligeramente reglas restrictivas y con la capacidad de estrategia del cuñado hemos logrado sobrevivir. 
Me gustan los cooperativos y el roleo, y este tiene buenos materiales y ambientación, aunque es duro...

This is the first game we bought without months of research, watching playthroughs, reading reviews... Zeynep chose this game by purely looking at the back of the box, reading the text there, and because there was a 20% off all games at the store, we went for it. And good thing we did, this game is really good! First off the board is the best I've seen in any game, the artwork is brilliant. The gameplay is good, I've read a lot of complaints about the passing of time after an enemy is defeated. I think it makes sense both thematically and mechanically. Technically, if you waste your time fighting monsters instead of doing objectives, of course you're gonna be set back a day. Well, maybe not a full day, but that's where the gameplay aspect comes into play. The players are expected to secure the castle, and accomplish given objectives at the same time. I think the intent is to avoid players just clearing the entire board and only then going for the objectives. The players need to make sure they secured the castle just enough that they can venture off and come back to defend again. There are more legends on the website including a solitaire one. Overall, a big thumbs up.

RATING: 7.2
Even if the theme might lead to think so, this is not a hack n' slash ameritrash game where you have trash your enemies, this game is more like a puzzle. You need quite thorough strategic consideration in order to accomplish the legends, otherwise you will fail for sure.

The learning process is a bit annoying for those veteran gamers like me who are used to read the manuals and don't feel confortable starting to play without knowing how to play... But it works.


What I like:
·) Very original and clever mechanics; different from every other game.
·) The games are tense, the Legends are well designed, there's a sensation of continuity and progress in each of them, you do things and you see how things advance. You don't get bored!
·) The graphic design is superb, a proud work of Michael Menzel. Still, the game would feel better with plastic miniatures at least for the players.
·) I don't know why, but I don't see a very intense "leader effect" in this coop game. 


What I don't like:
·) Lack of replayability. Yes, there are different cards and setups that provide different games, but the overall strategy and the experience is more or less the same. So is the feeling. When I repeat the Legends after a failed mission, they feel the same even if the setup and random events are different. Once you "solve the puzzle", it doesn't make a lot of sense to "solve" it again.
·) There are setups that combined with the random events, make 100% impossible to win. You don't know at the beginning and maybe you don't realize when it happens, but it's certainly there.


This game is really an 8, but the lack of replayability leaves it with a 7.2.

RATING: 9
First of all the artwork is lovely and it's one of the games that is very story-driven and you can really become immersed into the world. 
The characters really have their different strengths, which is nice, because you really have to plan not only what to do, but also who is best suited to do it. 
It's extremly tough in the beginning maybe even a little too much, but after a few more plays I enjoy the fact that it actually is. 
The introduction to it is pretty great, because it is a little bit videogameish and you can introduce people to it that way, which normally would be put of by the complexity that it looks to be like, when seeing all the components. 

The original legends become a little too repetitive after a while, but the expansion helps with that and as with many story-driven games it often just helps to set it aside for a while and then replay it again after a while, when the stories are not so "fresh" in mind anymore.

First impressions: 

Beaten-to-death fantasy setting with stereotype characters and a standard "first move, then encounter" design, and dull combat system. I'd appreciate the story telling element, if the story itself just wasn't so worn off.

The game seems thematic, of course, yet some mechanisms are Euro-ish in the worst of ways, like, for example, the storyteller proceeding with each defeated monster. I hate these kind of unthematic rules in a thematic game.

I suppose replayability is very low.

As we got to the end of the training mission, all we could do was laugh as we realized the game was totally stacked against us.  There simply wasn't ANY way we were going to get past the monsters with the letter in the time we had left.  Perhaps if instead of playing only a single character each in a two-player game we'd both been playing two.  Nevertheless, we had a GREAT time playing and look forward to bringing it to the table again.

Thematic strong, you can feel a part of the story. Replayability is a big question since it is one big story and you have to complete each chapter (which is very hard already at the second chapter). Coop features are nicely thought out (like the way to transfer things between heroes and the fact that you have to play both sides of the big board).

Defined scenarios that may be too fixed to warrant a lot of replay - that's the big fear, that there's not enough randomness within each scenario to warrant replay once it's been done and dusted, especially if you beat it first turn. Nonetheless it's a big hit with my tween boys because of the great art and the simple rule set. You've got seven actions each day (before the baddies move closer), use them to move a space or to fight, trying to beat up the baddies before they get to the Castle, in a homage to Castle Panic. The combat is fun enough though - each player is given a different dice process - and you can use the gold won by beating up the small baddies to buy stuff to boost you for the fights against the medium and big baddies. For those, you need to organise yourselves and take them on as teams, combining your combat values - and that's the essence of the co-op here. There's not lots of hard decisions - it's more about admiring the story, going along for the ride, rolling some dice and coming out on top.

"Gorgeous, puzzle-like, rich-storied, fantasy adventure co-op. Hooray for the hero gender options! My wife thinks the game feels quite punishing, and she prefers lighter games, so she doesn't like it  as much as I do. The setup is just daunting at first, but becomes quick. Legend 3 is very replayable."

What I like:
- Very beautiful art AND functional layout
- Tutorial was a fun way to learn together
- Very thematic, and I love how the story unfolds
- Love the scenario system
- Legend 3 is as replayable as any standard co-op
- Gender choices for the heroes

What I don't like:
- A couple rules are vague and/or easy to overlook
- First plays of legends 1 and 2 make it seem like there is no way to ever win (but they are winnable)
- Can be like solving a group puzzle, with possible alpha player issues
- The tutorial can make you feel like you don't quite know enough, even though you do
- The official solo variant is OK, but not great

This is a really interesting design, and I am enjoying exploring the full world of Andor. I would put the weight around 2.8. It took us 90 minutes from opening the box to finishing scenario #1 (with a narrow loss).

Don't judge the game until you have played Legend 3 a couple times. The other legends are like video game puzzles that you have to play repeatedly to "solve", but Legend 3 has as much variability as a standard co-op game, so is fully replayable. 

I'm not a big solo player, but I have played legend 3 about 10 times solo so far (including with the new heroes expansion). I don't like controlling multiple heroes in a game, but this one is best with 3, good with 2 or 4, and just OK with 1. It's fun enough that I put up with playing 3 heroes. 

After 21 plays (mostly legend 3), I'm increasing my rating from 8 to 9.

Ok WOW! Whilst in principle this game is just good, the way you can customise this and the fact that you can make up your own Legends is amazing! I can't wait to go through all the Legends and start looking into some fan-made legends as well as making up my own. Some of the mechanics that you can take advantage of is just incredible. It has been a while since I felt this excited about a game and I sincerely hope that it stands up to what it seems to promise.

The current rating is intuitive to how I feel about the game, over time I will adjust it for sure, just wondering whether it will be up or downwards!

It didn't strike me at first. I had the feeling I couldn't make neither the cool things I usually do in a dungeon crawler nor the moves I take in a traditional euro. I will for sure try it again.

Thumbs down: somehow the cooperative side of this game doesn't work out as I wished.

Very nice looking game. Lots of shit in the box and it's all very pleasing to the eye. The game is interesting as well, but not super fun. I knew that it wasn't a "kill shit and take their shit so you can kill tougher shit and take all IT'S shit" game when I bought it, but I was still a little disappointed by the restrictive nature of the game. It's very much a puzzle with many moving parts, and if you don't go with the flow, you will get bitch slapped. If you're looking for another Defenders, this ain't it. I'd recommend it to fantasy gamers looking for a change of pace, though.

Solid game that needs to be brought out in short succession to be fun. I've played the first 2 scenarios a couple times now and I really want to dive into it. The game seems tough with 2 players and I might just roll with 2 characters each since it's not really that difficult to do. I tend to dislike playing more than 1 character at a time though since I feel less vested in the story.

Beautiful game, but I worry somewhat about replayability. I'd love to acquire the expansions once they arrive on US shores.

Just 1 play and it was like a co-operative game should be: you have the idea you can win, but you lose close to the finish. So far, so good. 

This game won a lot of prices and even was the 2013 'Spiel des Jahres -  Kennerspiel des Jahres' Winner. And while I can see this is a good game, I wonder why? I mean, what is really new about it? Scenario's: seen before. Beating up monster to prevent them invading a castle: seen before. Develop your hero to make him stronger: seen before. Do other stuff in the meanwhile: seen before. 

The only really new thing I can think about is that every monster you slash brings you 1 day closer to the end of the game. But is it that that makes it win so many prizes? Off course the nice artwork of Menzel probably works. But what worries me the most about this game is the replayability from just the base game. You probably just have to buy all forecoming expansions to keep this game interesting, because once you've done all existing scenario's (and the base game only has 5 :s), the will be not a lot challenge left.

Legends of Andor might best be described as a cooperative Ameritrash-style tower defense - even though it has scenario driven story points and strong Euro-elements. Players take on the role of characters who represent standard fantasy tropes, the Ranger, the Fighter, Dwarf, & Wizard, each with unique abilities, and strike out into the world to fight the forces of evil. What makes Legends unique is the way in which the enemies act. There is a random element to seeding of the board with enemies at the beginning and sometimes throughout the game, but once the enemies have been placed, their actions are mostly prescribed & predictable. The players, then, are tasked with balancing the enemies' steady advance and the other tasks defined by the scenario.

Even see the harder monsters show up. I liked it!

I really enjoy playing this, solitaire only, so far. The downside is that a replay of a scenario reveals only minimal variation; the forthcoming events can be anticipated and planned for accordingly. Nevertheless, solving the puzzle is still great fun and, using Legend 2 (the first real scenario) as an example, knowing that finding the Witch early is, in my games, vital to winning, not finding her early enough means that you can always restart the game rather than continue to inevitable defeat.

Playing a new Legend, when the story is unknown, gives a nice feeling of story progression, especially if the complete narrative is read out loud, rather than merely trotting out the 'game-y' bits.

I played one day and had a pleasant experience, but then never played again.

Probably because rules are too complex compared to the complexity of choices to take during the game. It makes it hard to explain to new players, so you have to play again with the same people if you want to have fun again.
You also don't want to redo the first scenarios when you did them already, but new players won't have fun to skip the first scenarios.

Not sure about this one ... it seems to be on the lower end of the scale of fantasy coops, and it's clearly a German design, missing out many great elements from US made fantasy coop games. The rules are very euro-game like, as is game play. There is no real fantasy feeling coming up. I was bored when I played it. The combat system is nice at best. As a friend bought it, I guess I'll have to play a few more games, but I'd strongly prefer a different fantasy coop. In fact, any different fantasy coop.

Fantasy Co-op story driven puzzle. Dice rolling combat. Beautiful artwork, map, components. Medium weight, lighter than Mage Knight
-Some replay-ability concerns with the scenarios (base game with 5, but only some are repeatable realistically). Set-up can be a little lengthy

RATING: 7
A completely co-op race against time puzzle adventure game with dice rolling for combat. While there is luck, there is luck mitigation through getting equipment and leveling your character. Replayabilty in this case would be pretty much only through new adventures, as each game you see pretty much everything a particular adventure has to offer. The game has very easy rules, that are clear and plays very smoothly. While this doesn't come with minis, the cardboard standups are very well done, and my playgroup really appreciates that they included male and female versions of each character.

:star: Art, Iconography and components functional

Amazing game. Maybe is not for everybody, but if you enter on it, the game is full immersive. I have played it only twice (legends 1 and 2) and keeps me amazed. I played with my two kids (10 and 9) and we have won the two legends. Eagers to play the third

This one is on and off for me.  Owned it for a couple of years, played it a handful of times, however there is so much time in between plays that I end up starting from the tutorial again.  Today played with my 2 kids (ages 7 and 12). The 7 year old seemed to really enjoy it and both of them wanted to continue on to Legend 2.  A bit slow at times, but overall I felt easy enough to run and we had a good time with it.

Ich habe Andor bereits in so vielen Gruppen und mit den unterschiedlichsten Variationen gespielt- und doch fasziniert es mich nach wie vor. Mir gefällt die Vorgabe, nicht jedes Monster ohne Konsequenz abschlachten zu können, sondern taktisch nachzudenken, welche Monster man besiegen muss und welchen Kämpfen man aus dem Weg gehen kann. Leider ist die Schwierigkeit bei 4 Spielern deutlich höher als bei zwei.

I love the artwork, I love the fact that there are female heroes and that they actually for once are appropriately dressed, I like the idea of the game, the puzzle. But somehow I don't have a huge amount of fun playing this one. Maybe it is more fun in a group - have only played solo so far.
Perhaps the problem for me personally is that so many rules are on cards and not in a rule book, and I always end up spending an awful lot of time looking for the right card.

Had a great first game experience with this one. I love the theme of it and I really like how accessible it was--the first legend does a fantastic job of teaching you the rules of the game. Looking forward to playing this a lot more soon. Worked very well at 2, although I do have some concerns that it doesn't scale well across all player counts. (Seems like 4 would be far easier than 2). Also a little wary that it won't be very fun to rpelay legends after you beat them, but I shall see when I get to that point. A smart cooperative game that has you balancing many competing objectives.

Nice time management with the legend teller moving forward after a fight won and the hours passing by on movement and fighting rounds. Good: heroes loose options/dice in fight when loosing power. Not so good: No hidden information private to a player (except "Schicksalskarte" in Legend 3). Nothing too exciting all in all.
Gets me more by the story and graphics than the game itself. Increased rating after some plays.

I like the game despite it's antithematic touches (killing baddies ends the game faster, leave the stronghold undefended to win the legend, helmet helps your attack etc.). The difficulty is ok, you can manage to win a legend on a first try but then it will be very close.
Replay values seems to be limited once you succeded in every legend.

Confused.  I can appreciate what is a very well designed and intriguing gaming experience, but I don't know if I like it. It's essentially a co-op puzzle, a genre I don't have much time for, yet manages to have much more charm and appeal than something like [i]Pandemic[/i].  Unfortunately my gaming collection is big enough that being uncertain is enough of a reason to politely ask a game to leave.

A lot of fun. I love a cooperative game that really knows how to lay on the difficulty. The mechanics are simple enough and the tutorial mission make learning the game a breeze. There's plenty of strategy to be discovered through combos of certain items/abilities, though I wonder about the replay value once everything is discovered.

My big complaints about the game:
1. So much production value, especially in the tutorial mission, but I wish the money was spent on nice miniatures instead.
2. Often the mechanics don't synch up with the theme- like being punished for defeating monsters or how the wizard has almost no use for willpower. 
3. The rulebook is basically non-existant. You're taught the game through cards, and it leaves a lot of questions.

Overall: Despite it's obvious flaws, Andor is a game I'll look forward to playing until probability dictates it grows stale.

This game plays like a story.  You feel like you are on an epic journey while playing it.  There are several down sides to this game.

First, people pretty much have to play through the scenarios in order.  So, if you are constantly teaching people the game you will be playing the first 2 scenarios over and over and over and over.  This just means you need to find a good gaming group to play it through all the scenarios.

Second, which is totally a personal opinion and easily rectified, is the narrator advancing rule.  Every time you kill an enemy the narrator advances, which puts a time limit of sorts on the game.  We HATED this and decided to instead use a variant as follows:

When defeating a creature roll a red die. Do the following:

1-2: Gain 1/2 reward and the creature respawns
3-4: Gain 1/2 reward and the creature doesn't respawn
5-6: Gain full reward, the creature doesn't respawn and the narrator moves.

Respawn:
Roll a red die and a hero die.
Red Die: 1-2 = 20, 3-4 = 40, 5-6 = 50
Hero Die: = Face Value
Place the monster on the space of the Red Die + Hero Die
(i.e. Red die = 3, Hero die = 4 => Respawn at 44)

We have used this house rule for all but the 4th scenario (the 4th scenario is very different than the rest) and we like what it offers.

Finally, the things you want to do in this game are always out of reach.  For this reason I will never play it again with the rules as they are.  The basic game mechanics are really cool - monster movement, battle mechanics, the scenario cards, etc.  The "fringes" are terrible - buying items (especially from the witch), gaining strength, etc.  Our group NEVER purchased anything from the witch (it's simply too expensive).  Uncovering the fog is so fun, but only one person ever really gets to do it - that sucks!  This game is really tight, which isn't necessarily bad; but it becomes bad when it locks you out of all the cool things you want to do in the game.  This game does exactly that - so it's bad!

Once my game group finished the campaign we sold this game.  I hope to never play another game like this again.

Did not get past the second quest (tried twice and failed twice). Next time, I think we will go directly for the 3rd one. A great game, a great theme hold by narrative mechanics and tough choices. My older daughter, who is an eager reader of fantasy novels, loves it. Games may be quite long, though, and setup is a bit tedious, which makes it a bit hard to get on the table (does not get out casually, we have to plan to dedicate some time to it).

This game is more and more boring everytime I give it a try to play it... crossword puzzles are infinitely more exciting than this! 1 point just for the nice components...except for the cardboard heroes: they look awful and it is almost impossible to catch the difference from the male and the female ones.

RPG-Themed Cooperative board game with a wide variety of both characters to play and enemies to kill. Play through the six different Legends, all while "leveling up", looting items, trading gold for items and encountering the many different mechanics used in The Legends of Andor.

Box contains:
- Gear items (shields, helmets, bow and arrow, healing potions, etc
- Figures of 4 heroes to play with (Swordsman, Dwarf, Mage and Archer)
- More than 20 enemy figures (different in size, level and strength)
- An enemy Dragon, which need some slaying in one of the Legends (spoiler alert?)
- "Gold" coins, reward coins and many more
- Deck of cards with random events
- Deck of cards with playthrough mechanic of all Legends
- Huge foldable board with two sided-print (of two different worlds/dungeons!)
And much more...

8/10 - Would definitely play the Legends more than once and would totally recommend it to anyone who is interested in RPG/COOP boardgames

I wonder...
Once you know a legend you know where the 'keys' are... Will you play it again?

Is it a tactics game? Well yes the tactic is there. But once you know the Legend you know what's to come and you know what to do.
Hard to play still, but tactic?

Other downside I find in co-op games is that the player with the biggest mouth controls the game. The other player soon find his dessission: "Ok, I'll do that." then they lean back and wait for there next "Ok Ill do that..."
You best play this game on you own!

Great components, but for us the game soon proved to complicated.
It soon gets old if you have to play an adventure over and over again and fail to complete the challenge.

Innitially we figured we would want all the expansions, but when we kept getting bogged down in that one adventure we lost patience and disliked it so much we don't ever want to play it anymore.

Maybe they'll one day come up with an update for dummies

Michael Menzel híresen jó illusztrátor a játékvilágban - első saját játékában pedig nem fukarkodott. Minden komponens szemrevaló, csak az üres táblát el tudom nézegetni 10 percig. A kooperatív játék magát tanítja meg az első küldetéssel, ilyet eddig sose láttam. Bár nehéz de eléggé puzzle szerű, ami elvesz az újrajátszhatóságból, mégis sokszor elő fog kerülni, csak hogy a szépségét megcsodálhassuk.

Térjünk vissza oda, hogy nehéz... nagyon-nagyon-nagyon nehéz! A jól kitalált startégia mellett kb. egy rossz dobás vihet a sírba - de nem ám azonnal, hanem szépen apránként, ahogy tudatosul, hogy tempóhátrányba kerültünk a játékkal szemben és már nincs is visszaút... de azért is megpróbáljuk újra!

Not my kind of game. Each scenario is programed, and seems crushingly difficult unless you figure out the solution (and have a good deal of luck as well). I didn't have the patience to figure out the single solutions to the scenarios. A friend enjoyed the challenge, and seems content to replay the same scenario over and over until he gets the solution. Maybe he's a better man than me.

Feels like a grand adventure, and very exciting especially the first play through. After playing the stories a couple of times I can become repetitive as certain goals and actions have to be done a certain way for it to be "optimal". Still a very fun low-key adventure game.

RATING: 8.2
Impressed by the introduction mission alone. Looking into the box, still filled with many components not explained in the basic intro, I realised this was just the tip of a massive iceberg filled with beautiful, fantasy adventure.

Coop is a pet peeve of us, and the game engine is tough. Haven't yet mastered the intro-game. I'm not yet sure how much roleplaying is involved in the long run, or whether the game will focus more on tactical decisions, but it offers a challenge either way! Combat seems to be a bit stale eventually, but I like how you really have to pick your battle and are not able to just clear a dungeon and grind your XP. 

Artwork and detail of components alone put this game higher than most of the other fantasy games I've seen to date. The sense of realism of the artwork reminds me of Lord of the Rings. 

The stuff yet to discover in this box has me wanting to go back to the lands of Andor for more. I'm looking forward to gear up my hero and travel far and wide into this magic land. I'm really excited to return and unfold the stories in the Legends! 

Edit: finished legend 2 and I can safely say, this is a great game!

Una gran idea reside detrás de este juego de componentes y diseño gráfico excelentes, pero bajo mi punto de vista, se queda a medio camino en el mundo de los cooperativos entre el eurogamer sesudo (Ghost Stories) y el temático narrativo (A Touch of Evil).

Se queda, como digo, en una tierra de nadie a mí no me satisface, creo que coge lo malo de ambos mundos en vez de lo bueno. Hay otras opciones mejores a elegir en mi colección, y por eso sale de ella.

Recently won the "Kennerspiel des Jahres" 2013, well deserved.

Fantastic experience, easy to get into, no work or preparation, only simple fun. Coop fantasy game with top notch art and easy, fast play. One of the best new FFG game of the last years along with Netrunner. Strongly recomend it for a quick and easy fantasy fix.

Don't mind those negatives comments in the recent threads, those guys didn't get the spirit of the game. Comments about lack of replay value and the fact of the combat advanced the time marker being antithematic are clearly wrong or derived from a wrong expectation by the players. Believe me, the game is awesome, full of adventure. 

There is a ton of 'replayability' (at least for me) and the combat and time mechanic is great and completely thematic. It goes along with a 'tower defense' engine where you have to pick the right fights and get the job done before your time runs out.

Ordered via Amazon on 10-21-16 ($30).

My initial plays of this (solitaire) were not satisfying.  The setting and aesthetic are so generically white European fantasy, it pains me.  The "tutorial" scenario is dull and unnecessary (just tell me how to play your game, damn it).  But mostly, I just find the game to feel incredibly scripted and unsurprising.  I'd much rather play Runebound if I want a generic fantasy solo-romp - and that says something, given how flawed Runebound is.  Maybe this is better as a cooperative experience?  I may keep it in my collection for a while longer, but every time I see it on my shelf I feel a little betrayed.  Why do people like this?

It's a comparatively simple, fully cooperative adventure game. The biggest strength of this title is probably the tutorial, which is integrated into the first scenario.

Very few rules have to be read before starting your first game, which probably makes this a very good gateway game for cooperative board games. Basically that's the same 'niche' filled by Pandemic (another simplistic coop-board-game with little to offer for board-gamers who are already familiar with modern games and willing to read rules) and takes slightly longer to play, but in my opinion decisions are more meaningful and the theme is vastly more attractive in this one, which is why I rated it higher than Pandemic.

Note that, IF you are looking for a game to introduce someone to modern board games, this might easily one of the very best games you could get. In that case: Ignore the rating and just get this!

Игра неплохая, но ажиотаж связанный с ней явно преувеличен. Игре не хватает атмосферности. Вроде РПГ, а "лирики" в игре минимум. Игра слишком суховата и расчетлива. Говорят, что в оригинале на картах больше художественного текста, хотя вряд ли это помогло бы оживлению механики. Подход к освоению правил тоже на любителя. Как по мне, так, лучше бы просто вложили хорошую книжку правил, чем придумывать такую "инновационную" ерунду.

The theory of the game is good, however, there is only 1 way to play each scenario, if you mess 1 thing up you lose, which sucks with how long the game can take. Impossible to win with less than 4 players. Since it is chance/dice roll based battles, you need to boost your chances in rolling better than the enemies, which can be done with upgrades and grinding, however, each time you beat an enemy you move the timeline. Beat too many enemies defend or upgrading, you lose!! Defend your base by defeating enemies, you lose!! Phase timeline moves by default after everyone is out of moves. Can be improved and made enjoyable by one simple change, don't move endgame timer after every enemy kill. Changes game completely to a more RPG adventure, can upgrade, grind, explore, without having to plan every step from move 1.

Beautiful artwork, particularly the main board. Enjoy the learn as you go approach. However, translation and implementation issues make navigating the rules frustrating. Very thematic with highly complementary mechansisms(time track and puzzly prioritization). That said, this game rubs us the wrong way. We've found the mix of luck (dice-driven combat resolution), limited resources (time), and determinism (set story events) to conflict. There's very little margin for error and the game is lengthy, so luck doesn't have a place here. For example, one bad roll early on can lose you the game 30-40 minutes later. As a result, the game is less than the sum of its parts.

Mikor elkezdtem társasozni egyre-másra faltam az új játékokat, kerestem a legbonyolultabbakat is, olyanokat is, amelyek szabályának többszöri nekifutás kellett, hogy kb. derengjen mit kell benne csinálni. Menzel játéka lehet a legjobb időben talált rám. Hihetetlen, hogy 2 oldal jól érthető szabály után már játszható a játék. 4 oldal szabály után már az első kalandon is túl vagyunk. Nagyon jól kitalált a mesébe bevezetés. Lehet családoknak, kezdő társasoknak még így sem lesz rögtön minden kristálytiszta, de gyakorlottabbaknak nem jelent akadályt. Nekem nagyon tetszett ez a megvalósítás. A grafika gyönyörű, de ezt már megszokhattuk az alkotótól. Rettentően jól eltalált a legendák nehézsége. Az elsőt éppen megcsináltuk, a másodikat éppen elbuktuk. A játékot ostorozók az újrajátszhatóságát kérdőjelezik meg. Jogosan, bár én egyáltalán nem éreztem ezt két játék után. Igen, vannak sarokpontok és trükkök, amikkel egy-egy legenda könnyebben megoldható, de bőven van random tényező, ami szerintem többször újrajátszhatóvá teszi a játékot. Biztos vagyok benne, hogy sok nagynevű játéknál többször kerülne elő egy közepesen erős gémer csapatnál. A játékidő is jól eltalált. A rettentő hosszú ameritrash játékokhoz képest, itt 1,5 óra alatt lejászható volt 1-1 legenda. Aki szereti a fantasyt annak szerintem mindenképpen érdemes megnézni és kipróbálni. Nekem nagyon tetszett. Szép munka!

Only played legends 1, 2, and 3, but we're enjoying the game so far. First legend, of course, is a learning game, and we easily fulfilled it.

I enjoyed my first play of this:

I liked the track which triggers reading of cards and advancement of story plot.

I liked the simplicity of the combat system and the way that neither the monsters or the heroes seem overpowered realtive to the other.

I worry about the replayability after having played through the 6 (or 7 ?) stories that come with the base game.  We are currently playing a game of descent weekly which is the exact opposite - It feels that there are endless games possible.

The enjoyment to be extracted from this game is minimal for all the effort the players must exert to solve the puzzle of each scenario, especially when the successful and positive actions of the hero characters are at complete odds with the proper "solution" to the puzzle.

A bit disappointed in this one.  I had high hopes from the beginning, but it occurred to me after playing one quest that the next time I played it, it's going to be just too similar.  I know that things are going to be in different places, but it's just frightening to think about the replayability factor.  Still, it's a solid idea and a wonderful first game from the great Menzel. *Update* - I'm giving it another go-through.  I think this would be best to play solo or with people that I know better. *Update 2* - I've played several times solo and I just can't get excited about this.  There's just something about this game that I can't get behind.  I wish I could!

This is a solid co-operative. I did feel some sense of telling a story, although there is certainly more of a tactical tower defense aspect to this than other titles out there. The combat system is pretty cool, as you use the die you rolled the highest, and I like how you can work together to defeat more powerful creatures. The most interesting mechanic is how time can advance at different rates for the characters, which means that with clever timing, you can get a lot done.

Several plays, mostly solo.

I hate co-ops! And I still don't enjoy this with other people, where you have to do the usual co-op thing yammering about what the best plan might be, and try to convince others to do something! Playing this solo, however, has been much more interesting -- and I don't normally play solo games, either! But I like the fantasy theme, admire the design work that went into this (to make the legends work; provide flexible setups with the various creature tiles and legend cards; number the board spaces so creatures move like they're supposed to, cards work correctly, etc.), and had a fun challenge working through the legends (1-5) with various character combinations.

This is an interesting game.  It is a story-driven cooperative adventure game with a fantasy setting.  The gameplay is very simple but I'm actually okay with that part because the focus of the game is on the story and that really does manage to flesh it out the rest of the way for me.

One major complaint that a fellow gamer has levied upon this game (and games like it such as Mice and Mystics) is that the story progression is very arbitrary.  And it is, the story progresses at the end of every day and also whenever a monster is defeated in battle.  I don't, however, feel this takes too much away from the game.

In my one play of the game so far the difficulty and game tempo seemed to be pretty perfectly balanced is why.  At first I worried that we accelerated the story too much by advancing it after every successful battle but everything fell into place in our first game pretty well (the introductory campaign).

That said I have a HUGE problem with the amount of content that comes with this game.  There are only 6 adventures and really there are only 4.  The first is introductory and meant to introduce the major elements of the game without really giving you the whole experience and the 6th is a cop-out set of blank cards for writing your own adventure.  I'm not that creative and even if I were I don't really want to take the time to do the designer's job.

4 plays is not a lot of mileage to get out of the retail price of a game and judging from my first play I'm sure repeat plays will not be as interesting.

In the end it is a coop game that plays really easily for families and a wide array of gamer levels and plays a little differently than other coops I have so I'm not too disappointed with it.  It's simplicity combined with its lack of replayability do keep it from shining too bright though.

I think the game's method of teaching the rules, which was certainly worth an experiment, has too much downside for what it gives. This is not a particularly hard game to learn for relatively experienced gamers, and it takes just as long to go through the "training" as it would have been to grasp the concepts it teaches--and it only makes the rules more difficult to research when you need to.

Terribly boring puzzle.  Even fans will admit that there's basically one solution to the problem, which means it is completely a take it or leave it kind of game.  The killing monsters means you have less time to win mechanic is completely silly.  It makes very little sense even if you try to argue that you shouldn't waste time killing monsters because monsters are always moving toward the castle.  If some monsters moved off in a random direction and really were inconsequential to kill, I could stomach it.

But therein lies the heart of the problem.  The game is like a trial and error NES game.  Once you know what to do, the only challenge left is whether or not you can actually press the buttons (or in this case, roll the dice well) fast enough.  This means that games literally come entirely down to luck once you happen upon the solution.  This is vastly irritating.  It also means that if you didn't happen upon the solution, you are basically guaranteed to lose.  That's infuriating.  I realize some people like this style of gameplay, but there's a reason modern games moved away from such trial and error gameplay.

Interesting cooperative game with some neat chapter progression; however, the inability to save progress from one chapter to the next means there is less of a narrative arc, so much as individual stories.  I did enjoy the progression within the chapter by the unlocking of events based on the number of days, and accelerating the timeline for each enemy killed really provides a strong incentive to achieve goals and balance gameplay.

Played through the campaign once and really couldn't get into this game. The mechanic of penalizing the heroes for taking out monsters is REALLY frustrating and does not hold up well thematically enough for me to not house rule it. I read through a thread where this was the exact sentiment of someone who argued it with many people at length. If you're looking for a puzzle with fantasy theme, you may enjoy this. Unfortunately I haven't yet found a good trade to dump it out of my collection.

RATING: 5.75
Too much like a puzzle but with way, way too much variance. Can be super easy or literally impossible based on the starting set up. Rolling dice for placement on some huge things? Some challenges are impossible without the right character configurations. Just too much luck for a game that wants to be a puzzle co-op.

Maybe if the system was more interesting, but the whole "must team up to kill everything" or "power level one character to mop up" is silly and doesn't feel right.

Overall, the game isn't bad. But it isn't something I'll seek out. Would rather just play Gloomhaven or a dozen other co-op games.

This game is more focused on exploration and puzzle solving than tactical combat.  Each time you kill a foe, it brings you one step closer to the end of the game, so you have be very selective about who you kill.

I'm able to see that this is a very well designed game. And gorgeous, too. But the puzzly aspect just doesn't appeal to me. It's like a weird blend of Euro and Ameritrash that I can't appreciate. I think I just don't enjoy counting steps and planning four turns ahead in my fantasy themed games. I mostly just want to roll dice and hack and slash. Except that doesn't sound like me at all, so I'm at a loss to why this just feels like an unwelcome puzzle to me. I suspect it would be far more fun if I was playing it with others instead of solo, but that isn't likely to happen often enough, so onto the Trade list it goes...

I had such high hopes for this game. The components are nice, the art is nice, they actually give you an even gender mix of characters and the women look like real adventurers.
The game is well set up to learn, with an intro that gets you straight into the game. I dread the thought of having to look up rules later with this setup however - there's no real "rulebook" at all.
The action mechanics, leveling up and fighting monsters are all decent.
All of which is ruined for me by one mechanic I completely despise. You are under a time limit to complete scenarios. Defeating monsters pushes the timer forward. You are punished for doing what you MUST do to defend the castle! It makes no thematic sense, and leads to incredibly frustrating game that just "feels" wrong. (We have been winning scenarios by the way - this is no way reduces the intense frustration). Most of the game is geared toward fighting monsters, yet you aren't allowed to fight monsters!
I managed to get over this for scenario 3, and was trying to accept it, and then we hit "draw a card and you lose because you upgraded too much" which you never could have known would be a problem. I despise trial-and-error gameplay, and this is trial-and-error at its worst.

Las Leyendas De Andor es un gran gran juego! A diferencia de lo que pueda parecer no es un juego de exploración, ni de matar monstruos ni nada por el estilo.

Este juego vendria a ser...como resolver un puzzle. Es decir: cuanto he de moverme, a quien he de escoger matar, y que he de hacer primero para poderme pasar esta mision en estos escasisimos ... numeros de turnos?

Es un gran juego pero dado su elevadísima dificultad hace que tengas que volver a repetir la misión. Eso hace que como es un puzzle (sin apenas libertad para conseguir de manera exacta tu objetivo) pierda frescura y pierda puntos.

No deja de ser un gran juego!

This is a cooperative adventure game.  Play one of 4 different characters and try to complete the quest while preventing the castle from being overrun.

There are 4 different scenarios.  The storyline of each scenario is played out by drawing cards from a predetermined deck of cards.  Players take turns using their actions.  Depending on what you do, you spend a certain amount of time.  You can do more time consuming actions on your turn and that is made up by other players able to take enough actions to catch up in time.

Dice is rolled to fight monsters.  The way you determine success is different depending on your class.  You can obtain treasure to increase your abilities throughout the course of your quest.

There is no actual rule book that describes how to play this game.  The manuals make you play out the introductory quest to learn how to play the game.  Each part of the introductory quests teaches you one aspect of the game.  I would have liked a manual to teach the game and make the introductory quest optional.  It would make it easier to teach new players if not everyone in the group is a new player.

RATING: 9
Rated this game as a family/kids game (age 8-10). Kept everyone engaged, even my younger kids wanted to be present and roll the dice.

My eldest kept asking for it, getting other kids at our vacation spot to play it as well.

Highly recommended for the gamer dads/gamer mothers amongst us!

As for the game itself: mechanically it is a simple puzzle optimization (feels akin to Mage Knight light), however the thematics in this game are strong and the illustrations really draw you in. This is probably what makes it such an excellent light family game: mechanically easy enough to be grasped by children aged 8-10, while visually engaging enough to draw (and hold) everyone's attention.

Eat your heart out, Defenders of the Realm.

Without kids: too light and dry for my taste, despite the gorgeous artwork. Too much alpha problem as it is a puzzle coop. Drop rating by 2 points: still a fine game but certainly not one I'll suggest on a game night.

[APR 2017] This game is requested over and over by my kids. They really dig it so that's why I keep it around. As for myself, because this can be pretty unforgiving game making the bad decisions I find myself making all the decisions and getting myself a headache by doing it. Basically, not my game of choice but the excitement of the kids is what matters. Played when my youngest want to join his elder brother and friends in some epic monster slaying. Stashed away otherwise, awaiting the time my kids lose interest.

Took 4 tries to beat legend 3 and that was with getting lucky on the fate cards and monster placement. Some of the fate cards are just ridiculously hard and shouldn't exist, plus if you're unlucky when placing monsters at the beginning of the game then you might as well not even start and reset immediately. It appears the game or at least legend 3 is very 'luck of the draw'. 

Still a fun game however.

OK, I guess most of you know by now that I'm not a big fan of co-op games. I like the idea, but I'm still hoping that one will turn up that I really love.
OK, so on to this game. Respectable publisher, respectable artist, first time designer. That could be a winner of course. And I guess most people will see it as a winner. This is one fine designed game. But it didn't blow me away and it didn't feel all that original. It was touted as being a quite original take on the co-op genre, but it didn't feel like that to me.
We skipped the intro scenario and moved on to the next one right away. It proved a good move as this was a challenging scenario for first time players that we only lost barely.
So all in all I found this to be a very solid game, but it is not as original as I expected and it didn't do anything that changes my stance on co-ops.

Takes a lot of table space and some time to set up. But I like the time management aspect, and that it always evolves into a tight win or loss. The story is pretty basic fantasy fare. Suitable to be taken into the theme, but nothing special.

Went in expecting a dungeon crawl, but came away with an interesting logic puzzle.  Sort of an adorable game.  It always seems so limiting to reset with each legend and not advance, but it is OK.  Would be interested in playing with more than 2 players.

This might really lack replayability. The first legend is very short and is just to teach the basic basic basic basics of the game. It really has no replayability and once you've done it, you need never return to it, even with other newbies.

Legend 3 has the most replayability with a whole chunk of randomness in the setup. Even still, the basic principle is the same; protect the castle and try and work your way out from there to accomplish your goals.

It was fun, and it worked remarkably well, but it's really nothing more than Pandemic is.

Update:  Probably the most engaging game I have ever played.  It has depth without AP and an edgy amount of luck.  In all, an amazing coop game that won't be taken over by a single dominant player.  Seriously, thank you Michael Menzel and your family.  If you don't own it, buy it. 

I should mention that I am not a fan of games that require a couple hours of deep, pain-staking calculations where the players can show off their intellectual prowess.  I like fun games, not spreadsheets with themes.  Screw a large portion of the BGG top 100.

First Comment:  I can't disagree with my wife.  She said, and I quote, "This game is nearly perfect--great theme, it's different every time, it moves quickly, it's got enough going on to keep it interesting but not overwhelming and, best of all, it's cooperative."  I've never heard her say this!

Brilliant! I will never part with this!

There are a lot of weird things about the game that seem very unpolished or unconventional.  The cardboard standees, the names of all the monsters, and the names of the heroes in particular are just kind of odd.  It's also strange that you somewhat get punished for killing enemies because it pushes you closer to running out of time.  But all that said, I've enjoyed my first two plays.  The leveling up aspect is kind of lacking, but there is some power growth.  Combat is fairly simple yet somehow very satisfying.  The missions are interesting and really force you to not waste any time.  Both missions so far have come down to the wire with one win and one loss.

Update: After 5 plays I decided to let this go.  The stories were thin and the missions felt like bland optimization combined with swingy dice chucking.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
The rulebook is horrendous, and the amount of set up and tear down time, it seems to take longer than Caverna without inserts. But the game plays well and I find the tightness interesting. You can't kill too much, and each action needs to be game changing. Sometimes though you can do everything perfect and be let down by the dice, and that's a bad thing in a game this long and fiddly. The scenarios however are really interesting and flavourful, despite the generic theme. A game I prefer to play solo though, as this game lends itself to alpha gaming, and absolutely needs everyone to be on the same page and know and plan exactly what everyone is doing and when.

Played the first two introductory quests. Nice coop, and I like the way the rules are introduced gradually. Of course, it has a lot in common with other coops. Go somewhere, keep the threats in check, solve the task and balance all the activities you have and want to do. Not sure about replayability . do you need a new scenario when you play, or can you retry the same challenge more than a few times?

--

After more plays I can see some replayability. The game can be a brain burner, especially on the last few turns. How many monsters can we kill, and how many do we have to kill until one of the end game conditions kicks in? How much strength do we need to kill this enemy? Can we still pick up that object before we must face this threat? Who should start the battle, and can we stilkl make it when we wait for the last player character to arrive? T-hese questions involve a lot of counting spaces and adding numbers, so if you do not like this, stay away from Andor. This is a themed Euro-Coop, not Ameritrash.

An streamlined fantasy co-op.

This game has both a great theme and some very decent mechanics. It works great, and can easily be played by new gamers (which is not the case with most if not all fantasy adventure games of this scale). Luck is only a randomiser in this game, and player actions/cooperation win or lose a game. It flows exremelly well and provides some pretty satisfying gameplay experience.

I've played the first 4 scenarios so far and I dare say replayability may be an issue. Out of all 4 only the 3rd is really replayable and that was too easy in our first play. There is a way to rump up difficulty but I see little reason to do so as it really is arbitary - just less "time" to complete that legend. The second problem I have with this game is the legend track. In all the thematic games I've played I've found some way to translate mechanics into theme - some are ridiculous and maybe laughable but they at least make the mechanics accepted and less arbitary. The legend track in this game has beaten my imagination. Half the time it advances when a day passes and half the time when a monster is killed. I can see it works brilliantly mechanics wise for the game, but I just can't explain it thematically and it bothers me. If the mechanics are the bones of a game and the theme the skin and flesh then there is nothing covering the legend track in this game - it's just bones.

Overall I think this is a brilliant game with two nearly fatal flaws. Some may ignore them, others may consider them trivial but for now I'd rather play some more before I finally make my mind.

I picked up this game in a math trade to play with my son. It's just the sort of game he likes, a cooperative game set in a D&D-ish theme. For our initial play, we played a two player run through of the introductory Legend One.

For those who don't know the game, the first mission, or legend, is just a "Let's teach the new players how the game works" type of thing. So while my initial impression of the game is fairly good, I'm basing that in part on the belief that the other missions will be more fun once the handholding you through how the game works stuff is taken out.

I enjoyed the initial mission. It gave a pretty good idea how the game will play with the standard missions. It looks like it will end up being a challenging co-op, with tough choices.

I have a little concern that the game only comes with five missions, one of which is never going to be replayed once you learn the game. I've also heard there are some "spoilers" so that also cuts down on the replayability... although I've been assured that the third mission in particular has random elements and provides a lot of opportunity for replay value.

I'll probably update this entry once I have a chance to play the game again. It's a little early to come out definitively on this game.

RATING: 7
[thing=127398][/thing] is a light cooperative game with the focus being on theme, not on mechanics. This doesn't mean that the game has poor rules, just that they don't matter all that much, and you can learn them little by little - the game is designed to do this: in the first scenario, you will learn about movement, exploration and using locations; in the second, about fight, the progress of the story in the scenario, the movement of the monsters. Basically, in this sense, [thing=127398][/thing] is a lighter version of [thing=73171][/thing].

The setting is the realm of normal fantasy: warriors, wizards, castles, monsters, dwarfs (and, as is old D&D, the name serves both as race and class - not sure how the dwarfs fell about this). The scenarios are story-driven and the heroes are different (in powers and in story) from each other. The art is really well done and thematic as it should be: they are truly the vision of the designer, since, well, the designer is also the artist.

The game bits are good, but not as much as in [thing=65532][/thing]: the player boards aren't sturdy, nor the game comes with miniatures - for the heroes and monsters the game uses cardboard pieces, which I don't mind because the art in them is good and is the same thing that I had with [thing=15987][/thing], but with better bases.

I liked the game, but, so far, it hasn't posed a challenge yet. I need challenge in my cooperative plays. Though, it is said that some of the scenarios can be really challenging. I don't know if this means "harder than the usual scenario of this" or "at least as hard as to win a game of [thing=38506][/thing]". I guess is the former - I'm interested enough, anyway, to try and discover.

*******

Addition 07/31/13: I did manage to squeeze a game of the second scenario - [i]Long Live the King[/i] - on sunday, and this scenario really put up a fight to be beaten. We had to think about movement (of our heroes and the monsters) in order to deal with the four demands of the scenario (defend the castle, find the Witch, bring the herbs and destroy the Skrall fortress). I won't rise the grade of [thing=127398][/thing], but I can see that, if the next scenarios are at least as difficult as this last one, I might bump the rate to 8.

Nice coop game, but the characters aren't balanced (Dwarf sucks) and the "Alpha player" syndrome is very prevalent. Also gets a bit depressing - not challenging - when only bad things happen all the time. It looked very promising and I played through all the base scenarios in the orig. game and would give it another play-through or two if ppl I play with would want to, but I'd rather opt for something else.

Nice Story with exellent graphic. every legend is good playable on it own, but for the story sake, i play it in row and move on after i won. and some of the legends we (2 player) won really, on the last turn. needs good planning and some luck also.

Pretty well tuned co-op game, but boy are there a bunch of rules that make no sense when  you think about them.  Still, it was fun to try to figure out, though I'm not sure how much replay value there is after you play each scenario.

RATING: 7
Rating based on playing the first two legends, which we ended with a very close victory. I am not a big fan of co-ops, but Legends Of Andor is a breath of fresh air in the genre - just like Pandemic was in the day. When compared to most american co-ops, Andor feels less random and has more of an emphasis on teamplay. The way each scenario plays is very story-driven - almost like Mice & Mystics. Finally, it plays more like a family game than a gamers' game (just like the titles mentioned previously). All in all, it is a game that I have to be in the mood for, but would love to play every now and then. The artwork by Menzel really adds tons of atmosphere.

SUPER beautiful! Unfortunately game play wasn't as exciting. Lots of reading cards and fiddling around for very little and somewhat unexciting game play. I like the idea that you could learn the game by playing - but to me this game is a tad too complicated and fiddly for that. It all ends up easily with lots of frustration. Therefore, to me, it misses its goal.

a kinda fresh idea!i wasn't expecting to like it so much!
although it's light and it hasn't so many rules it's really fun and enjoyable but at the same time tough to win!
i like the fact that it's different from other adventures and has a great adventure fairy-tale feeling!
i kinda disliked the tutorial-based system but you can't have it all...  

it's ideal for families!

It's like every other cooperative game, you try to fulfill quests with the help of dice... I don't like cooperative games at all. This one is at least not that long so it's not a 1 for me.

Great game, but sometimes a bit hard for unexperienced gamers I think. Sadly the last campaign felt like a grind. whenever a new event occured the game wasn't winnable anymore and we had to do it all over again. The dragon fight was also not very good. Overall the game was still really great!

RATING: 4.5
Initial impression, limited plays.  

Seems like a puzzle with randomness (that could guarantee a loss even with "the/a solution").  The scripting of the game (where enemies appear, where they move is all mostly static) is such that it narrows the solution set to such an extent as to make good play just as scripted.  Worse still, there are events (that are mostly static: e.g. this monster appears at this spot on the board, this other monster appears at this other spot on the board, etc.) which are not supposed to be revealed until later in the game and are necessary information to determining the viable solution(s), virtually guaranteeing a loss the first play through.   

Having only played 2 out of the 5 "Legends" (scenarios) that come with the game (there is another official "Legend" available for free download already); it seems like the game will be too scripted and puzzle like for fans of the adventuring genre (even those that generally like co-ops): while being to random, with far too limited replayability, for those that enjoy the puzzle aspect.  

Most co-ops, especially better (in my - probably not humble enough - opinion) co-ops, such as Arkham Horror, Sentinels of the Multiverse, Pandemic, etc. have game AI which forces players to react to it; Legends of Andor seems to want the players to develop a script and then execute that script against the game's script, with any risk mitigation or backup plans factored into the player's script before the game starts.  

One of the aspects of the game which drives or at least factors into the puzzle aspect of the game is that successfully fighting and defeating an enemy pushes the timer forward (essentially forcing all the heroes to lose a day's worth of actions - 7 actions per hero [ each hero may spend health to get up to 3 more]).  This is: 
1) Not just anti-thematic, but actually draws players out of the theme and forces the puzzle aspect of the game in their face 
2) Extremely counter-intuitive - I just eliminated some of the enemy's forces/resources, so now I have less time to accomplish my goals? 
3) Seems to detract from the purportedly heroic nature of the game/theme (we need to allow as many monsters as possible into the castle so that we don't spend time fighting them) 
4) Just generally seems to negatively impact the fun of playing

Replayability seems low. 
Scaling for number of players seems poor.

RATING: 8
Simple rules, difficult and meaningful decisions, and potentially different every play. Wow! Unlike any dungeon romper I've ever played. Not a kid's adventure game or just a storytelling game - it's a strategy game/RPG hybrid! This feels tense, rather than a pointless hack, grab and slash, ad infinitum. Outstanding (*except that Legends can be won or lost, on the luck of a few bad die rolls)! *Also, docked a point (for difficulty level out of the box), and the need for house ruling (and all that errata).  

I'm quite happy with the standees - my Pathfinder pawns just got a new lease - tabletop RPG style games bore the hell out of me anyway. See below (& *above):

If you're the type that requires your adventurers kill everything in sight, whilst gathering up every available resource by the ton, (kill all - take all - sell off) this probably isn't your style of adventure game. *Detractors stating "it has low re-playability", need to engage their imaginations (or P&P skills). This is HeroQuest on Euro-Steroids!! An game of Euro Quest, anyone? *puff puff* Oh, official re-playability. See below:

*There's hope some great expansions are forthcoming (especially, for the reverse side of that breathtaking board).. and please, please, make an ADVENTURE KIT (someone) to ease creating new scenarios... for the PC... someone/anyone - Hint hint... Just to make my GM-ing life easier. Thank you, Kosmos!

I can see myself playing all the legends once. It could have had an even heavier emphasis on the story of the legend. Also it had some, in my opinion, illogical things in that you were severily punished for killing too many monsters instead of rewarded. Unless you carefully calculate and optimize the monster killing in legend 1 it was impossible to succeed.

This great theme, strategy, and characters.  The board and chits are beautiful.  The characters all feel different and have unique abilities.  You really feel like you're in the realm of Andor.

Negatives:
the numbering on the board makes it hard to find spaces
takes a while to set up
not much in the way of replayability on certain legends.  

Hack and slash and dungeon crawl lovers be aware, you cannot just kill everything in sight.  Killing a monster has some consequences on time.  You must pick and choose your battles wisely, this to me is a plus.  It creates a lot of thinking, strategy, and tension.

Overall well done solo and coop game.

Michael Menzel híresen jó illusztrátor a játékvilágban - első saját játékában pedig nem fukarkodott. Minden komponens szemrevaló, csak az üres táblát el tudom nézegetni 10 percig. A kooperatív játék magát tanítja meg az első küldetéssel, ilyet eddig sose láttam. Bár nehéz de eléggé puzzle szerű, ami elvesz az újrajátszhatóságból, mégis sokszor elő fog kerülni, csak hogy a szépségét megcsodálhassuk.
Térjünk vissza oda, hogy nehéz... nagyon-nagyon-nagyon nehéz! A jól kitalált startégia mellett kb. egy rossz dobás visz a sírba - de nem ám azonnal, hanem szépen apránként, ahogy tudatosul, hogy tempóhátrányba kerültünk a játékkal szemben és már nincs is visszaút... de azért is megpróbáljuk újra!

CAN'T EARN PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION UNLESS THEY PRINT EXPANSIONS IN ENGLISH

What fun! A game with no rulebook that you have to slog through before you begin, and where you learn your objectives as you go along. Great fun! The components are beautiful and clearly presented, and the game - innovatively - prioritises teamwork over monster megadeath. A euro dungeon crawl - would you believe it?!

UPDATE: After 3 plays, each quest can be played several times, even after it's been won since the board state is slightly different with each play. In the medium-term, it's got more than 5 plays in it... I've given it several % extra for including a) female characters and b) female characters in reasonable costumes. This is A BIG DEAL for female gamers. Thank you Michael Menzel - you are a star!

Great material, great setting, nice artwork. The whole family loves this game (including the kids (girls, 7 & 10). It's not the game it looked to be first out of the box - we thought it would be more role playing... but it's more a puzzle game with role playing settings and some leveling mechanics. Still pretty good. The author has put up a  few extensions to download on his homepage - which is good, since that is usually the most severe criticism that I have with story driven games: Their replayability is not very high, so then "end" too soon for my taste. Not here - plenty of extra content available.

Очень красивая кооперативная игра, с простой но занятной механикой. Подходит для семейного времяпрепровождения. легко играется как в компании так и в соло. Представляет по сути игру головоломку. Не является RPG, хотя и очень на него похожа (оформление, тематика и присутствие некоторых RPG элементов). Имеет ограниченное количество официальных сценариев (задачек), хотя они внутр себя имеют рандомизирующий механизм, меняющий различные условия по ходу партии. Есть простор для творчества и написания собственных сценариев, благо дизайн игры дает широкие возможности для построение своих уникальных задачек. Правила достаточно просты. Оформление прекрасное. Хоть все жетоны и картонные, выглядит игра отлично. Партии не очень длинные 1-2 часа. Если вы любите соревноваться, любите глубокие ролевые игры или ваша компания страдает от синдрома - "один игрок решает за всех", то игра скорее всего разочарует. Если нравится кооперативные игры и вы любите совместно решать головоломки, а потом следовать выработанному решению, с поправкой на случайные события, то игра может вам понравится.

Intriguing and thoughtful game with extremely limited appeal.

I'd be happy to play through all five adventures, but it's unlikely that I'd ever own it.  I'll rarely, if ever, be able to bring together three other players who enjoy overly analytical coop games that can be sabotaged by distinctly non-analytical die rolls and events.

A game that would be enjoyed by 1 in 20 gamers, at best.  My family and gaming buddies do not fall within that 5%, though I definitely do.

Nicely put together and quite simple co-operative adventure game. The scenario we played was very balanced and it came down to the wire. I liked how indiscriminate combat is discouraged because the time track is advanced for every monster you kill, giving you less time to complete the scenario. That made the game feel different from other dungeon-hack adventures. Streamlined rules, plenty of variability and family-friendliness make this a great mass-market adventure game.

RATING: 8
Theme/Art:
The Art is great, but the theme and setting are a bit too generic for my taste. It's classic mainstream fantasy and it does that very good, but I would have liked some unconventional things.

Production quality:
The design is awesome, but searching for a certain field on the map can be a bit confusing. There are no miniatures, only cardboard figures, but they look really good. There is a LOT of stuff in this game, ranging from cards over tokens for everything and a two-sided board to creatures. Everything feels very high quality.

Replayability:
I haven't played through all the campaigns, but since we lost the first one on our first try and the second one too, I guess it will take some time until we beat the game.
I weight it 3/5.

Depth/Difficulty:
This game has an amazing intro. You don't have to read 50 pages of rules, you simply start a tutorial campaign which explains everything on the go. The game is less complex than it looks, but you have many options to choose from.

Strategy:
You have to work together as a team. Simply doing something and see how it works out will probably lose you the game, you have to consider every step you make and discuss them with your team.

Luck:
Combat is fought via dice rolls, but you can strengthen yourself and group up to make combats as short as possible (short combats are a big part on your way to beat a campaign). There are also event cards, which are drawn from a deck.


A great co-op game, I will update this after I played a few more campaigns.

Very impressed with this. The built-in tutorial works great, and it is a nice mix between euro and fantasy.

Have only completed the first legend so far. But boy was it fun! The amount of game for your buck is amazing.

Fighting monsters is never really that interesting to me.. Roll a die blah blah. But It's truly the story that makes the game awesome. 

Love the fact the board is double sided to reveal an underground and cavern area. And the board is massive!

A nice puzzle adventure that deserves to be played by every gamer, is different from anything out there.

Every legend is a hard puzzle to solve.
Also has the most stunning art on a gameboard.

Cons: Replay value low, although there´s a lot of fan legends outhere (aslo the mini expansion the shields stars generates a random setup legend like the legend #3)

Co-op rpg, but with no need of a GM/DM. It has a great and clever mechanism/automation for the monsters and that makes it different enough. Sadly, ends fast. Needs its expansions.

so far, really impressed by this co-op rpg.  The legends are well put together, and provide a great thematic glue to the outstanding mechanics.  They are very hard though, and will probably require several tries to win.  Maybe there are some balance issues with less than 4 people playing.  Look forward to see what legends are created in future expansions.

At first we were fooled into thinking this was a high fantasy romp. It actually plays like a time management, action economy type of affair with a smattering of dice and card flips for random events. The jury is still out for me on this one, I think I may come to appreciate it more once I understand the mind set that the game rewards.

I'm thinking about giving all the scenarios a try then moving this one along.

Along came Gloomhaven and I no longer want to play Legends of Andor!

Tried it again with selling in mind, liked the 2nd scenario enough to keep hold of this and play it some more. The introductory scenario is a poor start to the game, I have the feeling it is going to improve.

It is a great game overall. But it is like chess. If you know the strategy you can always win with it. It spoils the replayability.

I enjoyed Legends of Andor, but have only failed once at Legend #1. I have an urge to play it again. There are a few odd thematic disconnects to me, such as spending "hours" and buying strengths. However, I still had a great time playing, and want to try it again.

RATING: 9.55
Very awesome and really challenging game.

The trade-off between killing the monsters and letting them approach and maybe even storm the castle is great too. In other games you just run in and kill all the monsters near you, in Andor every monsters brings you a step closer to losing, this makes the game a fantastic puzzle coop.

For people that never played Legends of Andor before: The tutorial (Legend 1) seems a bit boring at first but is pretty great. All the rules are explained step by step, so it's really easy to learn the game. I was also pretty glad that I didn't have to learn all the rules and then need half an hour to explain them. I'm often the one that reads the rules in advance and learns them to explain the game, so this game was an awesome exception!

Def takes some time and space to set up and play, but worth it imho. Free community legends are a huge bonus. Very nice artwork too! GF loves it too, so that adds +1 :D

[COLOR=#EFF5FB]Extremely interesting looking game!

Beautiful board draws me in with a lure. Rules and reviews will decide its 'Cult of New' fate. The art style is terrific, and the theme is an evergreen.

I sincerely hope this game [i]is[/i] the bomb.

Why I bought this game:
I was looking for a lightweight alternative to more traditional D&D tabletop RPG experiences that would work for 2 players and would be something my wife and I both enjoyed.

Experience:
We really enjoyed working through the 6 campaigns this game comes with, and completed them over the course of 8 days or so. With only 2 players, the game was enjoyably difficult and required enough strategy to keep us both engaged as we played through each campaign. The mechanics of the game are also enjoyable, mixing event cards, equipment tiles, and dice rolling quite well. We haven't played with any more players yet, but look forward to seeing how the game scales.

Pros:
- Beautiful artwork and gameboard
- Fun campaigns
- Enjoyable cooperative play
- Can find additional campaigns online for free

Cons:
- Only 6 campaigns in box set, reducing replay value
- Long setup (10 minutes or so)

Overall:
I enjoy this game and look forward to printing off some of the free campaigns online, as well as trying this game out with more players.

It is a great game with one major problem: if you solved one of the missions, there is not much reason to do it again, except with a different player count. that is very unfortunate

The components and artwork look great.  The story was OK.  However, it felt so scripted that I felt it pretty much pushed what actions I would take.  The variability for a specific scenarios seemed mostly limited to what specific space certain things happened so replayability seemed a bit limited.  Can have a lot of downtime if you are playing with 4 people and you do all of your moves right away.

Too much reading and too little action for us, but the game is designed very well. We are going to give it another chance one day.
Had to leave behind in Slovakia.

An interesting game that brings together a lot of different styles of games into a fresh new package. We've got co-op, high fantasy romp, dungeon-delving, American-style dice chucking, European-style action points, elements of pick-up-and-deliver, economy management, exploration. Whew!

I like this one plenty and the other half likes it even more (that's a rarity, by the way). Recommended!

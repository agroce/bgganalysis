Love Blood Bowl, so this sounds fun. 

Enjoyed this at Origins 2012, would like to pick up a copy someday soon. 

Got for Christmas and Birthday 2014, along with both expansions!

Blood Bowl is a lot of fun and I like that is scales well for two to four players.
Medium strategy I think, but very accessible to non gamers especially if the theme appeals to them.

Theme home run for me.  Brings back memories of Blood Bowl and provides a  quick and chaotic game.  Player skill helps a lot but it's more risk management than forward planning.  Blood Bowl fans this is a must, otherwise try before you buy.

A clever deck-building esque game based on blood bowl. All the teams play differently and no 2 games are the same due to the difference in highlights. No catch-up mechanism so some players can get left behind.

Superb game - densely thematic with just the right mix of luck and strategy.

The races complement each other nicely and each has a distinct feel. It would have been easy for FFG to release each team as an expansion but with 6 in the box there is a lot of immediate depth.

A bit of a shame it loses the "spatial" aspect of BB with the long-throws etc, but it captures the campaign feel perfectly.

This is the game that gamers think you are talking about when you mention fantasy football. The game really captures the theme of fantasy races playing a bloody variant of football well. The experience honors the original 2 player tabletop version nicely in a card game that scales up to 4 players. I've enjoyed this game very much and can forgive the swingy nature of it.

I like the game.  The theme is fun, the game is relatively light but there are some good decisions to make.

I like the art style and game mechanics.

Some of the staff upgrades seem to be a bit powerful but it seems manageable.  

It may last a little longer than it needs to but so far every game has been down to the wire.

+Sudden Death

RATING: 8
Great game that has great art, theme, tension with the dice and yet decisions are still meaningful and fulfilling. 

Downside is the game really does play best at 4 players, although it works at all player counts but it shines at 4. Also although not too often but a dice roll can decide a good turn once in a while.  

In conclusion, still highly recommended and can't wait to play it again.

Some of Dominion's spawn now have two heads; A Few Acres of Snow has a soldier's tricorn on one head, for instance.  This one is half climbing game and half deck builder.  (No doubt the holy grail will be a deck-building game where the cards are also workers.)  A fun game that rewards canny play but also involves a dash of luck.

Pros
- The theme is great and fits in well
- Cool different decks to use
- Nice components 

Cons
- You can get destroyed and have to play out the rest of the game
- Runs longer than it should (1.5 hours)
- Some decks seem a lot better than others
- Very swingy 

Sold/Traded because:
- Ran a little long
- Prone to kingmaking during the last matches

This game works best with two players in my opinion. With three or more players it takes too much time for what it is. You have to accept that your decisions might (and probably will) be horribly overrun by the cheat tokens. But that's part of the fun.

RATING: 9
An amazingly fun game that captures the intensity of the board game while including plenty of strategy and surprises! It's also easy to teach and setup quickly.

My group loves it! And cant wait for more Teams!

Only a few of the team upgrade cards feel overpowered to the point where they can break the game or swing things wildly.

One of the great surprises of my collection. I acquired it specifically to play with a friend who was a major Blood Bowl enthusiast, but he moved before we got a chance to play it. It sat in my collection for a year before I managed to get it out at another friend's birthday. Everyone loved it. Tremendously tactical, with great theme. Gamers with no interest in sports even take to it.

Really good fun, the game plays nice and quickly and brings the flavour of Blood Bowl nicely. For some reason my chaps (dwarves first game) get caught cheating more often than not (despite only 6 tokens being whistles I get close to 3 in 4 called every game), but a good investment:)

The dice and cheating tokens can be very cruel in this game, but overall a lot of take-that style card play fun.

The abbreviated season variant is also a fun bonus and exactly what I want.

I havent played this game more than 5-6 times, but i still find it very good. It would make it to the table more often if the artwork was more girl-friendly. I can see this game get multiple plays in a row if the right group is up. WIth all expansions i think its replayability is really high.

This game plays like a more violent Balloon Cup in that there's a tug of war over several cards at once.  I need to play some more to see how all the cards can work together, but I like it a lot so far.

AFTER FOUR PLAYS: This has become my favorite game from 2011.  With four players, it can be a little long, but it flies with two, and it's a very different experience.  None of the races seem overbalanced (I'm 4-0 and have played four different teams).  Hoping for some good expansions in the future!

Took me a little while to wrap my head about this, but I really do appreciate a chance to play something like Blood Bowl in an affordable format without having to sell off any organs. I'm also glad it still features a little bit of head to head action even playing as a manager, and I like the ability to upgrade your team with Star players and special abilities.

Fantasy Flight once again showing that it knows how to use the Warhammer license. Great card-based tactical game. My concern is that it's a *little* too random in that your decisions don't affect the flow of the game, but rather what you draw does, but perhaps the game is like Warhammer in that it's about eliminating the chance out of the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Perhaps it was because I was already tired and a little boozy, but the one play I've had of this game was a bit of a slog. As a deck-builder, it didn't really feature that much deck-building and manipulation, and there weren't that many opportunities for interesting combos. I'm prepared to give it another go, as I'm sure having knowledge will speed it up, but I'm concerned about the number of interesting decisions to be made in this.

EDIT: Further plays, with a clearer idea of how to win and a much shorter play time make this a better game. It still falls a little short of a 4/5 for me, as there just isn't quite enough deck manipulation options

Tight tense game and the artwork is lovely too but, well, I think there are some games that are just crying out to be played with miniatures rather than cards and this is one of them. Wouldn't be the same game of course because there's no need for minis in the game as it is, and as a result I never quite get the feeling of murderous players on a bloody pitch, the cards remove the game to the abstract.

I was hoping this would take what I love about Fantasy Football and turn that into an hour-long game in a goofy orcy setting.  It wasn't quite that really.  I'll have to play it again now that my expectations are more reasonable.

RATING: 6
Sokat gondolkodtam két pontszám közt, végül a kevesebbet adtam rá, de ez még javulhat. Egy schotten-totten-re emlékeztető játék, csak bonyolultabb, és elég hosszú lehet. Itt amerikai foci-meccseket kell megnyerni, amik párhozamosan zajlanak, illetve néha több résztvevős torna is zajlik pluszban ezek mellett, ahol egyszerre 2-nél több csapat is küzdhet a győzelemért. Aki sorra kerül, az lepakol valamelyik meccshez vagy tornához egy játékost a saját oldalára, erősítve ezzel az ottani csapatát. Az új csapattag típusától függően üthet, labdát megszerezhet, csalhat, cserélhet, egy meccs vagy torna győztese pedig növelheti nézőszámát (=győzelmi pont), új sztárokat igazolhat, illetve mindenféle segítő kártyákat szerezhet. Általában a vesztesek is kapnak vigaszdíjat. Nagyon változatos a sok kártya miatt, de ami az előnye, az kicsit a hátránya is szerintem... Nekem a vége felé már túl sok volt a magunk elé lepakolt kártya, esélytelennek éreztem átlátni, hogy ki milyen módosítókat tud használni. Emellett kár hogy ennyire nyelvfüggő, illetve hosszú. Az előírt 5 kör 3 fővel közel 2 óra volt... De mindenképp előnye, hogy 2-3-4 fővel is játszható.

Great, fast game. Good as a filler between longer games or as the main attraction. Nice theme without that being a real let-down factor for non-sportfans (not in the case of some members of MY gaming group anywayz). Good gameplay, even for 2 players with easy mechanics, nice surprise factor with the use of cheating tokens. Try taking that away from my collection if you dare..
UPDATE: I no longer believe that 2-player games are an option. Maybe it's ok for the first 1-2 plays to learn the game and be able to teach it to others,beyond that: 3 or 4(preferably) players a must to really enjoy the game

I was a huge fan of Blood Bowl, since its 2nd edition. Today I have not enough time to play in a league, so I don't really play it anymore since the single game is less satisfying than playing a series of matches with the players increasing their skills...
With this background, I was eager to try BBTM. Well, the game is a fun ride! Everything is quite simple and straightforward, but is also quite thematic. There's lots of luck, of course, but the fast and furious play makes up for the somewhat random feel... The teams play very differently, and there's even quite a bit of interplay variability due to the removed cards.
In the end, if you don't take this game very seriously, you can expect buckets of fun from it!!

Took a bit to get past the rules.  Some things weren't implicitly mentioned.  Was a lot easier to understand after reading some fan made rules summaries.  Game reminds me of Battleline and Smashup, with an element of deck building mixed in.

Best with 3 then 4, followed 2 and lastly 5.

Initial Impressions: Although essentially a card game, this game captures the flavor of a season of Bloodbowl. Team building, recruiting, hiring star players, and striving for the Blood Bowl are all my most favorite aspects of a regular season of BloodBowl minis. And they're all here in the card game. Although the six teams have very different play styles I'm looking forward to more teams and seeing how their unique attributes are represented in card format.

Unbelievable game.  If you like Blood Bowl the TT game this game is right for you.  If you are looking for a superb 2 player game that scales just as well this is the one to get.  It has all the flavor of BB and loses none of the factors that make BB the TT game so good.

I was a fan of Warhammer for a long time and got out of it because I found this hobby instead.  No painting.  Thank god.. I still love the universe though and Blood Bowl was always a cool game.  This is not Blood Bowl, but rather a fairly simple card game where you try to out think your opponent by trying to win hands on opposite sides of the table in order to upgrade your team to gain the most victory points at the end.  You are a manager of one of many different factions from Warhammer with unique powers making every team slightly different thus different strategies required to win.  I like it a lot.

FFG games almost all fall into this same sort of generic category for me.  I never feel like I have just played something amazing, but I am not really dissappointed.  It's like a movie I enjoy well enough to keep watching, but never remember what it is called later.

Nice mix of deck-building, strategy/tactics, luck and player interaction. As a lot of the early reviews were from Blood Bowl players and I'm not a fantasy game fan, I was a bit hesitant to get it. Now, I'm happy to have it.

Simple, fun game.
The theme is interesting, and works even for people that haven't played the original Blood Bowl. The mechanics work perfectly and make the game a wonderful experience

I love how each team plays differently, and feels different from every other

The art is fantastic, and the attempt to reflect the mechanics of the game are honorable; Fantasy Flight came up with a bunch of neat things in their efforts to recreate the game with cards.  Unfortunately it just doesn't feel like the game reflects the theme as well as, say, Death Angel.  Something about the game just doesn't gel with my group, either.  I'll still play it occasionally.

RATING: 9
Better with 3 players, with 4 it takes a bit long for what it is.  I'm sure 2 player is good too, but I think I like this as a semi-light, social game.

Everyone we've played it with likes it.  Even non-boardgamers.

Note: If only one manager has players in a highlight, he gets EVERYTHING on the card!  An incentive to injure!

Fun, somewhat light, but nevertheless there was some definite thinking going on.  Deciding how to commit when you want to Sprint to get rid of a Lineman is interesting, etc.  Sufficient time for trash-talk, but maybe I should've spent more time thinking since several players (myself included) did slow the game down by thinking on their turns.

A bit long for what it is (but enjoyable throughout.)  A definite element of luck. Finally, it can be easy to miss/forget the Team Upgrade abilities of the other coaches.

Blood Bowl Team Manager has everything you may wish for in a game, that is strong doses of randomness, interaction, taunting, humour, narrative and even strategy to some degree: it also makes a good job of transposing the miniatures game into a card game, slightly shifting the focus in the process from winning a success on the field to gaining the most supporters over a season, which is so close a ploy to victory points to practically being the same thing. (May 2013)

[b]Update[/b] - I can’t get this game out of my mind: I enjoy it better and better after each play, which means it fully deserves an even higher rating on my side. Thus in June 2013 I raised it from 9 to 10, the fourth time I’ve rated a game so high.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game rocks.  While it feels like a spin off of Battle Line it clearly does its own thing.  The simple card play actually makes it feel like you're playing some form of Blood Bowl.  Each team is very different and there is tons of variety in the base game.  The game is meant to be played fast...but it invites AP.  Don't over-think it and you'll have a great time.

Demoed and bought at GenCon.  Have only played one full game so far.  I'm a lifelong BB fan and I'm amazed at how well they captured the feel of the original.  This isn't an attempt to turn BB's mechanics into a card game.  It does it's own thing, keeps the flavor, and is great in it's own right.

Okay, I played this as they were looking for a fourth player.  This game wasn't on my radar and normally not my type of game, theme wise.  But you know what, this game was really good and I really had fun with it.  Complete shock and surprise to me.  It is a great four player game of back and forth.  I love the asymetrical teams as it gave it some flavor.  The game play was simple and engaging.  In the lines of games like Battle Line and others that escape me but can play with four.

Kicsomagolás és alkatrészek:
A doboz méretének semmi köze bármilyen szabványhoz és a minősége is ócska vékony papír ami nagyon hamar elszakadhat. Ez így nem egy FFG minőség. Viszont a grafika tetszetős. Kibontás után a szabály alatt egy 2 db kinyomó karton leledzik, mely nem értem miért van fóliában. E mögött van a tároló rekesz, mely egy kétszínű grafikával van nyomtatva. Itt található három kártyapakli, két dobókocka és összeszerelő alkatrészek.
A kártyák grafikái szépek, de a kártyák szélein sorja leledzik. Erősen javasolom a kártyavédőket, legalább a csapatkártyákra. A dobókocka sajnos műanyag, mely asztalon dobáskor nagyon hangos.
A kinyomó kartonból könnyen kiszedhetők az elemek és a minősége kiváló mind grafika mind pedig anyagminőség szempontjából. Sajnos nem fényesek, azaz nincs rajtuk  felületi védelem, így kopásesélyesek.
A játékos kártyák hajszálpontosan illeszkednek a Swam 57x90 kártyavédőkbe, de a kis kártyák 41-es méretűek, még nem találtam hozzá normális védőt.
Az pontjelző alkatrészek könnyen összeszerelhetők voltak és jól működnek.

Játék:
Leültem, megtanították és megnyert engem a játék. Nem vagyok se foci se fantasy rajongó, de mégis úgy tetszik a játék ahogy van. Nagy csatákat lehet benne vívni és ha nem agyalják túl a köröket még pörgős is. Ajánlott darab, aki szereti a kártyás játékokat. Szerintem nyelvfüggetlenné lehetett volna tenni.

This is a fun game with lots of character, but suffers because the actual game play is not that "footbally".  Once you are away, the advantages each race brings to the game starts to shine through, but by that point a game usually comes to an end.  

Not one for every game night, but still fun to break out.

RATING: 7.5
Was very excited to try this game. Got to play someones copy at an FLGS game night. 

4 player game. Was very, very enjoyable! Had all of us cheering and booing. Took about 2.5 hours (all of us new, and sort of knew the rules). Would play again in  a heartbeat, but did move down my wishlist ranks. 

Notes: 
[-] Tons of pieces that need organization (several card and token types), making setup and take down a little obnoxious for the weight of the game. 
[-] Not much depth (although it is a light-medium game). Match rewards and player match-up choices are interesting. Asymmetry between teams is there, but not super noticeable after one game. 
[+] Interactive. I think this game is best with 3-4 players. 2 seems like it would be kind of boring, but 4 did make the game last a lot longer (especially considering the game weight). 

I really like this game a lot, but I just do not see it fitting into my normal rotation. Rarely are my groups 3-4, and it actually took longer than expected for the weight of the game in my opinion (although I can see that decreasing slightly after experience. It is still somewhat lengthy to play with the standard round rules). Depth wise, I would predict that this game would get stale for my tastes rather quickly. I would like it for my collection at some point, but I think it would only get played under perfect circumstances (player amount, mood, and desire for heavier game). Will still consider this for a future purchases.

Take that card game with the very cool blood bowl theme.  Lots of randomness.  Feels a little like a random multiplayer battle line.  Despite the randomness there's a fair amount of strategy and skill here.  Takes some plays to get good at and to make the game will move along more quickly.  So, simple but initially feels complicated and difficult to learn.  Light and random but long, a combination which hurts it a lot for me.  Not a bad game really, but not for me.

Juego de cartas ambientado en warhammer y basado en el famoso (y aún no por mí probado) Blood Bowl. Cada jugador es un manager de equipo. La partida dura cuatro turnos y en cada turno se pone en juego un torneo y cuatro crónicas de partido. En un turno, un jugador juega seis cartas que va colocando junto a la carta de torneo/crónica en el lado que más le convenga (cada lado supone unos premios, en caso de ganar). Al final del turno se comparan los valores de las cartas a ambos lados y el que más puntos consiga es el que gana y se lleva el premio (el de su lado más el premio central). El perdedor se lleva también un premio de consolación.

Las habilidades de los jugadores son variadas y los puntos que aportan al resultado del encuentro pueden verse alterados por varios factores (el hecho de haber sido derribado, haber hecho trampas).

Entre los premios hay cartas de equipo, cartas de poder o cartas de extrellas (jugadores con mejores características).

Es un juego sencillo de jugar y de explicar, pero con un grado de profundidad suficiente para hacerlo muy interesante. Recomendable.

I was going to buy this game on theme alone (I am a BB completist), but was positively suprised to find a very entertaining filler. It feels like a more complex Battleline but ten times more fun. Suffice to say that I have introduced it to over 10 people (including non-gamers) and all of them have enjoyed it. Rules are ridiculously simple, yet I always have fun playing it, win or lose. For once, I am looking forward to expansions.

Initial rating.  Love it for the game it's intended to be.  More plays will help me stabilize the rating.

UPDATE:  I have now played half a dozen times, with two and four players.  It definitely captures the spirit of Blood Bowl, and is a terrific game on its own, too.  I admire the designer's ability to abstract the matches, but still somehow retain the feel of Blood Bowl - and since I have played hundreds of games of Blood Bowl, I feel I would know.

Would love to - nope.  NEED to see some expansions soon. Where are my undead, hmmmmmmmmmm?

Would also like to know if there is any way to engineer multi-season arcs with salary caps and persistent star players... Who knows?  But the game is GREAT just as it is in the box.

1 play with 4; traditional Fantasy Flight stuff, pretty run of the mill for them. Surprisingly unthematic, actually - pretty much just another LCG with poor balance. A better designer would have given better incentives to commit to games early, the last-mover advantage here is huge and unevenly distributed. It might be a lot better with 2, where the playing time would be more in line with how much actual game there is here. If you're not a fan of FFG's stuff in general, you are unlikely to like this much either.

Reminds me of an Americanized Condottiere. All pay auctions (like Condottiere), but with post-decision random elements and special powers on some of the cards.

It's hard to take the game seriously, though. Not because of the art or theme, but because of the cheating chits. They make predicting outcomes pretty tough, even if half the time they help and one fifth of the time they hurt. Without the ability to predict what will happen based off of your decisions, it's tough to invest in those decisions.

It's fairly quick. So it has that going for it.

Take that, BattleLine!

I dig this game, but I definitely have to be in the mood for a take that game to want to play it. It's really good for the type of game it is. I just tend to not want to play things that feel so... reactionary all the time.

The flavor is a lot of fun. The variety of teams is super cool. You always have fewer cards than you want, which gives the game some nice tension.

The setup time is sort of a pain. It's not awful, but it does prevent this from being just a simple quick playing game like BL where you can knock a few games out pretty fast if nobody is prone to AP.

Compared to BL though it just... lacks an elegance. There's some fiddliness that just doesn't exist in BL. BattleLine also has better opportunity for long-term strategy. In this you tend to feel totally screwed if you have to change direction mid-play, whereas in BL it doesn't sting as much, it feels like you can save yourself more through strategic plays rather than just giving up and accepting the consolation prize. In particular, this makes it feel like luck of the draw is a bigger factor here. It might actually not be since here, at least, the luck is all up front every round, but when your opponent just has a hand you can't do anything about you really FEEL the luck.

Overall, it's a fun time. BL is too dry and themeless for you, check this out for sure. However if you prefer more interesting strategy and don't mind an abstract feel, I feel BL is a superior game.

My introduction to this game couldn’t have gone any worse game wise! I had the worst luck ever, it was insane to watch. However, I found it amusing because it was so crazy, and I definitely want to play this game again. 

I had some bad luck when discarding/”sprinting” through my deck, I only drew flutes and 0 star chits, and twice I rolled a double cross and wounded myself (and I’m not counting the tons of times I rolled misses and crosses; I literally think I only made like 4 hits in total throughout the game…)

It plays longer than I would like and the strategy to win seems to be Team upgrades. The Refs can be very annoying and frustrating at times. There really is no catchup mechanic so if your team falls behind its likely you're not coming back. With all that said, I have fun playing this game even with the downsides. It is cool to build up your own team and tackle some peeps.

Good game overall with some clever things going on here. Not a pure deckbuilder but its deckbuilding heritage is there for all to see. I would play again but feel no compulsion to ever own it. I won my first game against three smart gamers, two of whom have played before which leads me to believe one or more of the following: 1) I am a BB:TM prodigy of uncommon ability (snort) 2) that the game is a bit too luck dependent 3) that the game is imbalanced in favor of races/teams that can cycle through their decks quickly 4) that no one at the table has yet figured out a way to beat races/teams that etc. I hope that the answer is 4.

RATING: 9.3
One of my genuinely favorite games. To me, this is an archetypal game made in the modern age for modern players. It harks back very effectively to the original Blood Bowl, but doesn't demand that you have played a 4 year BB campaign to make the most of it. It is a game that is very important to play if you want to further your knowledge out about game design. From cheat tokens to the tackle mechanics, the game is chock full of excitement while still managing to scratch the "euro game" itch for those that are motivated by skill and mind games. I will never decline a game and recommend it whole heatedly.

Great card game which is perhaps a little lighter than I expected it to be. Some say there are too many random elements thrown in (particularly cheat tokens) but I think the general balance of things is pretty fair, and none of the above subtracts from the amount of fun we have.

Számomra azt hozta amit vártam tőle, sajnos mégis keveset vesszük elő, kiegészítőjét meg még ki se próbáltuk. Minden játékos saját egyedi csapatát "irányítja" és próbálja megnyerni a vérfoci meccseket és elnyerni a szurkolók rajongását. Akinek a legtöbb szurkolója lesz a végén, az nyer.

I used to play the full version of Blood Bowl back in the day. FWIW, this game has almost no similarity to that title aside from the theme. In reality, this is a cross between German fare like Battle Line and American take-that style card play and dice rolling.

Players each have a hand of players that have a value between 1-4 starting, and 0-2? once they're tackled. Players also have various attributes like being dirty, being able to tackle, or being able to pick up the ball. Each round a number of pitches are set out that give rewards for having the most points allocated to them. The goal is to just collect VPs.

In practice the game plays like this: I play a card to a field and pick up the ball. My opponent plays a card of their own and tries to tackle me, which is a 50/50 die roll. If I'm tackled, my card is worth fewer points. We do this a few times and at the end of the round, the players with the dirty chits on them (some of the teams have a lot of players who get these random chits when they're played, others don't) can be a boon, granting extra points to their value, or a liability, as they can be tossed unexpectedly.

Really, this unpredictability is why I think a lot of German game fans will despise this game. There are a lot of random factors to mitigate. You don't know if a tackle is going to work, you don't know if that cheating chit is going to win a fight over a given pitch or assure your defeat...&c.

I don't mind random elements in shorter games like this. If played briskly I wouldn't object to it strenuously, though for my money vaguely similar fare like Titan: The Arena is considerably more desirable as it has the same sort of card play without the egregiously random elements of this title. If this runs over 60 minutes it's taking far too long though.

Needs a squig expansion.

Played this one at Wintercon 2012. Really enjoyed it. Of the games we played, the same team won both times and my initial impression was the game was weighted towards that particular team (Chaos). However I think if you became more experienced the strategies for the other teams would develop. Not a casual game.

On the third game I played Chaos won again - before playing next time I think I will need to invest some time developing/researching strategies to defeat them.

Though the mechanics are completely different, this game manages to "breathe" Blood Bowl. Best-laid plans in desperate situations, tension, then utter chaos :) This is helped by the art, most of the original BB-fluff and the overall high production values.

I've played this game now more than 20 times.

I have the Sudden Death and Foul Play expansions.

I've played quite a few card based games and pretty much disliked them all. I tried this game expecting it to be just *meh* but ended up loving it and proving to me that card based board games can be fun.

Despite the apparent imbalance of the teams and rampant chaos in this game it still somehow almost always boils down to a close victory. The plays are very different and you never know exactly what will happen so you will either have to make a bet or play safe. Both strategies work and I love this aspect of the game.

I've read quite a few discussions on the forum about the imbalance of teams or how some of the are easier to play than others. This is acceptable to me and doesn't diminish the playing experience. You can draw a very good team and still lose or you can pick one of the weaker teams and win by a large margin. This game is heavy on the luck factor and some people might dislike that, but hey, this is Blood Bowl! When the referee is down you are supposed to bring out the chainsaws and order your hired wizard to throw in a fireball.

Cons:
- Can suffer from leader bashing. The Sudden Death expansion and the random contracts help with this.
- Base game teams can be a little bland after the addition of the teams in the expansions.

I haven't played the miniatures game, but I found the card game enjoyable. Good theme. The matches are somewhat reminiscent of [i]Perikles[/i] actually, though the mechanics of how each match is won is obviously very different.

The "cheat" tokens are a nice touch, and make the matches less predictable which can be amusing and aggravating at the same time. I think the end of game cards can be way too swingy, however. Still, I would play again from time to time.

Blood Bowl: Team Manager (BBTM) reminds me a little bit of Schotten Totten (or Battle Line if you want). Commit one of your player to a match-up, wait for the response of your opponents and see if you can win the match-up in the end.

What I do really like is your ability to kind of shape your own team strategy. While every team has it's default strengths and weaknesses, you can try to compensate or strengthen your team's characteristics by acquiring new players or upgrades. This gives BBTM a nice feeling of progression.

Another thing I believe BBTM gets right is it's theme. Sure, it not like this is a substitute for a full blown game of Blood Bowl, but the feeling isn't too far from it and it plays in less time. Something which matters more and more at this point in my life. 

Sadly, there are is one thing that prevents the game to get a higher rating: Luck. Normally, I don't mind luck in games, but somehow it bothers me here. Some of the upgrades that give you points in the end game scoring are just a little too strong in my oppinion. And there is no way you can be sure you will see one of it. [Edit: FFG seems to have addressed this point in the FAQ. Here, those powerful cards are removed from the game and are only used in a variant. I need to try the game again without them.]

Not a bad game and there are some fun moments but for me it is a bit too fiddly and plays too long for what it is and for the amount of luck that decides the game.

In terms of the luck you have the dice rolls, your deck card draw, your upgrade card draw, the cheating tokens you draw and whether your plans collide or not with the chaos that is a take-that 4-player game. There also seems to be some over-powered cards and combos.

If it came in at under an hour then I could take the luck level but with all of the card text to absorb a 4-player game is going to take at least 2+ hours which is too long for what it delivers.

There is a well-balanced game here and it does a great job of integrating the heart of Blood Bowl tackle dice, teams, fans, etc. However the game is heavy on chaos, and I don't exactly feel like the often-obvious play choices make a big difference in the grand scheme of things.

Manage a football team consisting of elves, dwarves, or another fantasy race over an entire season.  Deckbuilding elements come into play as you draft new star players, adding them into your deck, and there are also permanent upgrades such as merchandising deals.  The team with the most fans at the end of the season wins.

Pretty decent concept that manages to capture the theme of playing in a Blood Bowl season.   Star Players are added to your roster, and staff and team upgrades are available.   It plays sort of like an homage to Battle Line as players will compete in several different matches each week, trying to have the most strength on your side of the field.   The game is typical FFG in that there is component sprawl and a lot of table clutter.   A refined game this is not.   But, it's not that complicated either.  Due the to luck of cheating tokens and die rolls, it doesn't pay to over-analyze your options.   Quick players will make for a better experience.   And it is better with 2 or 3 players, as opposed to 4.  All in all, it is better than I expected.  And it is fairly priced, which is a welcome change of pace for FFG.   

(bumping rating from 7 to 8 after many plays.  There are some Staff cards that need to be removed per the 'No Salary Cap' FAQ.  Also, the ability to play 4 rounds instead of 5 or 6 is a useful variant.)

i don't really like deck builders so i was surprised to like this game. The game is essentially a multiplayer Battleline with lots of cool special abilities on the cards, some deck building/upgrade chit collecting and a heavy dose of fantasy world american football theme. Its about 20% deck builder 80% card game really. Good game, has several layers of strategic and tactical decisions from choosing upgrades / new player cards, to managing your hand, prioritizing objectives/rewards, taking risks with the dice, and actually playing out your cards for tactical leverage, and guessing your opponents future moves.

Played once. Never played before, read the rules, had to teach to the others. 

Wasn't as fast as I thought. Took a lot of time just talking explaining as best as I could. 

Some rules not well written. Would need to re-read the rules and play again to have a better understanding how the game works overall.

After, maybe game would play faster and the more fluid.

I'll start with the bad:

Like many other Fantasy Flight Game, this game comes as no surprise - it isn't balanced at all. Skaven are the most overpowered of all the 6 races in the box (they have a team upgrade card that gives you 2 victory points even when you loose a match - if you get it early in the game, you will win no matter what). After them, all the races that have an arrow sign on players (wood elves - the most) are in big advantage, because they can escape placing guardians (they litterally don't do anything). Worst are chaos and dwarves, both of which are dependent upon random factor, which might give you something, but can kick your players out (6/36, or was it 6/30 chance, I'm not 100% sure) - in that case, you loose match almost for sure. Also, dwarves (absolute worst) are the only race that don't start with big guy, and I don't see any advantage that would negate that disadvantage. Oh, don't forget their team upgrades - they are also the worst, because they need some conditions to work, and even then, bonuses they give are poor compared to other team's team upgrades (which, I repeat, usually don't need any condition to be met). Orcs and humans are something in-between: orcs have some dependace on luck, but that is balanced out in skills they have, and one of the stronger team upgrades. Human's biggest advantage is that they don't have any major disadvantage. They are true masters of being something in-between.

But then the good:

Our group usually have a lot of funny moments playing this one out. Blood Bowl (normal version), is my absolute favorite game, so it comes as no surprise that I love this one too - it doesn't have all those tactics that Blood Bowl (normal version) has, but it plays quickly, and it can be played by 4 people at the same time (it could be played even in more players if you really want to... you just need something that will represent 1 or 2 more football token). It is great as a filler game. Especially if your group is going to play a game for >4 players, and you are waiting for some of the group members to come.

2015-05-07 : Well-designed pure Ameritrash game which manages (ahum) to compact a Blood Bowl season down to its essentials while keeping the flavour of the various teams intact. 

We played it 4-player and this has the disadvantage that you can't remodel your team for a specific opponent. If you get the choice between 2 star players, one of which works against the Dark Elves and one against the Skaven, which one do you pick if you might encounter either or none of them in the next match ? You really don't need any additional random elements in a game like this ..

A point is deducted from the score because of the decision to use font size 3 (or whatever) on the cards, the failure to put important abilities like "dodge" or "sure hands" as a big icon on them and the color palette of different teams being too similar.

An ingenious, fun game. I never played the minis version of Blood Bowl, but I am only told that this is a good implementation of that game. I personally love the artwork and the mechanics are really cool, combining cards, race powers and a bit of dice. Maybe it's a bit long with four players, but you can easily scale the game down playing one round less or something like that. Pretty good!

In Blood Bowl Team Manager, players will be playing one of 6 unique teams.  Each player will commit players from their teams to various matches (tournaments and highlights) which contain benefits for placing players there and benefits you compete for.  Some benefits are better players, some are general upgrades, some are team specific upgrades, and finally you can gain fans (which are basically VP in the game).  In highlights, only two teams can take part but all players may participate in the tournaments.  So, I definitely consider this game to be more fun with 3 or 4 players than with two.  This is especially so because some teams play better against others.  Overall, it's a fun but not too complex ameritrash card game with a wonderful theme that truly shines.  There's quite a lot of excitement with the dice rolling and revealing of cheating tokens.  It should be noted that there is an issue with some of the Staff Upgrade cards which is highlighted here:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/768304/faq-is-out

In the end, I found it to be a bit longer than I would have liked with 3/4 people and can't compete with other 2 player games I've played.

It's 4 player Battle Line-turned-Ameritrash (but not in a good way).

I wanted a ready-to-play four-player card battler in the vein of Blue Moon or MtG and was recommended Blood Bowl: Team Manager. BBTM might be a good game, but the theme did nothing for me or my group, leaving only a mechanically dry game that took far too long for its respective levels of strategy and luck.

1 play (expansion) - 6.  Was alright, but i think there might just be too much going on for this to be interesting to me.  I.e. too much text to keep track of.  We'll see, perhaps with repeat play it would be manage-able.

RATING: 6
A fun game for the card play and different ways to build your deck/powers as well as score points. There's a fair bit of chaos in that everyone gets new powers each turn. Keeping track of them seems pointless to me so you just play what you have and hope nobody can undo your powers. I like the game and would play if offered but don't feel the need to own.

unfun at more than 2. the card play and mechanics are ok, but I felt the same sense of dread as when playing bloodbowl...3 games into a season and the upgrades drag the game into the toilet.

Gaming: A near perfect card game that captures the feel of the original Blood Bowl, but allows for up to 4 players. There's plenty of room for expansions... that could bring this score up even higher. 

BTW There are dice and hidden tokens, so "luck" is involved. However, it seems to be well mitigated by decisions, as all our games have been close.... just like a real Blood Bowl!

Would rate a seven, except for the truly annoying use of "1" instead of writing out "one" on the cards, and the phrase "1 dice." Really? You weren't short on space, so there's no excuse for putting in the number and not writing it out. And I know over at FFG you're smart enough to know that dice isn't singular.

Otherwise, it's a really fun game that has a bunch of replay value built in. The luck may be too much for some, but the swings should go both ways and even out in the end (and make for better stories afterwards). On the other side of the coin, plays may become obvious, which could be a detriment to replay value. 

I like the elves and chaos teams. The dwarves, not so much.

This combines my love of fantasy football, a fun fantasy-themed universe, and deck-building without the monotonous reshuffling. Regrettably, though, it's far from perfect.

La temática en un primer momento puede despistar o incluso tirar para atrás si no estás en el mundo Warhammer, pero el juego va mucho más allá de eso y todo el tema de orcos, ratas, elfos y demás sirve simplemente de ambientación y para generar las facciones asimétricas. Tiene su punto de caos y su punto de estrategia, y con una duración perfecta.

I've never played Blood Bowl so I found the way the theme was carried out, quite clever--even the goal: most fans wins.  Art work was good as well as the quotes.  Easy to learn and play is fast.  One player pointed out that there is, "time to work on opponents."

Several said the game could use expansions soon so that the game will feel different every time--new events, new teams, etc.

My problems with the game:  There is a lot of luck in this game.  It helps to know the cards (massive text), the teams, and football in general. (For instance, I don't know what a lineman does.  Is he a lineman because he is next to a side line, or in the front line, or the back line?)  This is another game that a lot of players enjoy because of the humor--text and graphic. I miss a lot of the humor because I like thinking about the moves, etc.

Again, I think this trick taking game is well done and clever, just not for me.

The deck-building fit the sports theme, but is just one mechanism in the game; the meat of play is in selecting matchups.

I like the positional element of moving the ball around and the way different matches are worth different rewards, and the six different teams appear to provide substantial variety.

However the depth of the tactical play seems a bit limited, and I wonder if the limited headline cards and reward card pools leads to homogeneity several games in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Score is an average, sometimes my group goes mad for it, other times we are all a little sick of it.  It is at its core a deckbuilder with a lot of bells and whistles.  When we want to play it, we love it.  When we aren't quite feeling it, we jsut aren't quite feeling it.  Still, being able to play 5 with the Foul Play expansion is amazing, since a lot of my games cap at 2 or 4 players (or at least are best with 4 even if they can play more).

Also, this gets across the feeling of Blood Bowl amazingly.  Just another example of FFG doing GW universes better than GW...

RATING: 7
There are a number of games where players duke it out in a tug-of-war of some sort (e.g. Battle Line), and special powers aren't uncommon, either (Caesar & Cleopatra, Ruse & Bruise) but I don't think I've seen an implementation so far that manages to create a thematically dense game and doesn't at the same time descend into pure chaos, especially with more than two players.

Simply dividing the conflict into a number of smaller battlegrounds goes a long way to containing that chaos because that way you don't need to put all your eggs in one basket. Oh, luck still plays a major role, and you can come out of a round badly bruised through no particular fault of your own but it rarely feels like there was nothing you could do, and in any case, the blow is often softened by not all spoils going to the victor.

If you can handle a bit of chaos, and the theme appeals just a little bit, give it a try. It's quite likely not as good with just two players, though.

I really like the pacing and the variety of ways to win, as well as the clear distinctions between the strengths of all of the teams. Beautiful components and great theme (which is par for the course for FF, at this point). The game is dynamic and generally well-balanced, but has issues during 2-player games: it's too short and intense to really allow for recovery after a bad set of matches, and can be lost in the first round if that goes badly enough. Best for 3-4 players.

I've played this about fifty times. This game has a lot of fiddly bits with different cards and variable player powers and it's fun to discover them in the beginning. I liked it a lot initially but it has gotten to the point where we have discovered the whole game and ultimately, it just isn't deep. You reach a point where there's not much to improve upon and the result of the game comes down to luck. It's just not very fun for me anymore when it takes this long and boils down to dice rolls.

An interesting take on a "football" game with Warhammer races.  The mechanics are somewhat reminiscent of Battle Line.  I enjoyed playing this quite a bit as there is some really nice back and forth tension.  I'm worried that some of the bonus cards are a bit over powered.  Really nice game in a small package.

Seems to capture a good deal of the flavor of Blood Bowl in a faster playing game.  Of course, part of that feel is the randomness.  While randomness does not play quite as big a role as it does in Blood Bowl itself, it's still a pretty big factor between card draws, dice rolls and getting ejected for cheating.  I like it.

This game is fun, but needs players of similar experience.  It takes a few plays to understand the relative strength of your choices, and new players might not like the situation.

RATING: 8
The accessibility, the ease of setup are appealing. It has a good mix of strategy, but also relies much on randomness as well. 

It plays like a much lighter version of the board game incorporating some of the same elements (tackle dice, similar star players ect.), but applies it to a card game battle royale. 

One aspect to note, is that the game is really designed for 3-4 players, but is still very enjoyable with 2. There is some imbalance and randomness, but Blood Bowl is still a fun fantasy sports game.

A neat idea, but it all seems a bit messy and actually winning the match ups soon becomes secondary to just trying to snaffle as many cards as possible.

This is a very good implementaion of the board game, all wrapped up into a cool little card game, that's easier and quicker to play. I was kind of iffy on it, when I heard about it coming out, but took a chance and happen to like this a lot. The game is fun and all the different teams, special abilities, star players, team upgrades and staff upgrades are all well done and very interesting.

My first game was a blast, even though my Orcs lost by 1 point to the damned Dwarves. So close and tense it was. I'm looking forward, to many more plays of this.

Really enjoy this one. I think the new "update" in the rules fixes the one problem I had in my plays, that staff upgrade cards were overpowered and tournaments didn't matter enough.
But yeah, the game is a blast and plays quickly. But make sure you don't mind some randomness!

It's an alright game, but not a game I would ever choose to play.  I don't really know why specifically, it's a bit too simple, it's over too quickly, before you can really get into it, and probably also because I suck at it if I'm being totally honest.  I don't mind playing it though, if someone else wants to.

I was a fan of the original Bloodbowl and I was pleasantly surprised of how well the theme was evoked in this "manager" card version.

Beside the theme (which my wife was not into, for example), the game play is excellent and clever, with a few original twists on solid mechanics (card placement and numerical value, but with a few rules which transmit the feeling of a football match, with control of the ball and "tackling" other players).

Really an excellent implementation.

I warmly suggest it to anyone who liked bloodbowl and/or to anyone who likes card-interaction games with strongly different starting positions and asymmetrical powers.

There are things that I love about BBTM and things that I don't love.  I love rolling the dice, and the different abilities, and the cheat tokens.  I do not love how there isn't as much customization of your team as I'd like, how there is a runaway leader problem to some degree, and how powerful and point riddled the team upgrade cards are.  All in all it's a fun game that I'm always willing to play.

*edit* Since they updated the game by removing some of the team upgrade cards I am VERY happy with the result!

RATING: 7
Blood Bowl Team Manager is a card game with a very smooth Euro-like core, plus a generous helping of the sort of aggression and thematic color you'd expect from its Fantasy Flight and Games Workshop pedigree. Each player chooses a team such as Dwarves, Elves, Skaven, etc. Each team has its own unique deck of player cards, and also a unique set of upgrades that can be added between matches. Powerful "Star Player" cards can also be added to the deck, although I wouldn't principally describe BBTM as a deck-building game.

The goal of BBTM is to earn the most fans for your team by the end of the game. Fans can be earned by making cool/illegal plays, meeting goals set by some of your upgrade cards, and most importantly, by entering (and hopefully winning) matches and tournaments. Most matches involve only two teams, and you do have some choice over who you will be playing against. The tournaments are multi-team brawls.

The basic game flow consists of taking turns committing player cards to one of the two or three matches your team is playing that round. The players each have a basic strength value, along with one or more special powers and/or action icons. The special powers could be just about anything. The action icons include cheating, tackling other players, gaining possession of the ball, and drawing more cards from your deck. Tackles involve rolling dice in an attempt to reduce an opposing player's effectiveness (and maybe make him lose control of the ball). Cheating involves drawing an unseen token which may give you the cheating player extra strength or extra fans, or may disqualify him. The winner of each match is decided by the total strength of cards on each side, modified by cheating and possession of the ball.

BBTM is fun if played at a reasonably fast pace. It's not so fun if players are spending too much time analyzing your options. This is a light, chaotic, theme-heavy game. It works best when played as such. Even when played at the proper pace, I feel like the game lasts one round too long if you have the full complement of four players.

The sheer amount of hours put into this by our group testifies to the fact that despite of its shortcomings, this is a great game. Not because it's perfectly balanced (it isn't) but because the gameplay and mechanics are so much fun. The game is really only complete with its both expansions and then there's a lot of teams to try and they all work slightly different each time depending on the opposing teams.

I highly suggest keeping a running score of the games you play. Awarding points on final ranking gives you an idea of the power levels of the teams and the players. Besides, studying statistics is a huge part of football so it fits to the theme perfectly.

Blood Bowl Team Manager is a 2 to 4 player card game.  The goal of the game is to get the most fans after the 5 (4 in a 2 player game) season.  During a season, each manager compete at (generally) 2 highlight at the time.  At each turn, you place one of your team's player on one highlight.  Your objective is to beat the opposing coach at the other end of the field.  The team that have the most Star Power on his side of the field wins the highlight and take the central payout in addition to his side of the field payout.  If the payout is not more fan, it will help you for the next seasons.  You can gain star players, team upgrade or staff upgrade.
Most of the player in your team have skills that can be use to take the ball, draw a card from your deck, tackle the opposing player or cheat.
Some season also have a tournament (with bigger payout) where all players can participate.
The winner is the player who has the more fan after the final season that ends with the Blood Bowl.

There is a lot of diversity in the game deppending on which team you're playing :
- Human are a well balance team.
- Dwarf are tough and well armourded.
- Wood elf  are good at controlling the ball.
- Skaven are fast (can draw more cards) and cheats.
- Orc are tough and tackle a lot.
- Chaos are cheaters and try to injured the opponents.

It has some problems: it is longer than it should be, and there is a stage where at the end the victor's clear with no means for anyone to topple him, or - even worse - you have a bad, bad team and there's no way to get yourself out of the quagmire.

Well as a card game, I wasn't expecting to like it much. But, as a fan of the board game, I thought I'd give it a try. The game was interesting and fun. The game really infused the theme and 'history' of the board game into the card game. I can see some fun in this game. However, in the 3 player game I played, it took way longer then it should have.

Es un juego de cartas con algo de deckbuilding bastante competente. en el juego cada jugador lleva a un equipo de la blood bowl (el equivalente del football americano que existe en el universo de warhammer fantasy) y participa en varias competiciones con el objetivo de conseguir el mayor numero de triunfos (para los cuales no necesariamente se deben ganar todas las competiciones). 

Como ya digo, es competente, esta bien pensado, y es medianamente variado para la tematica que tiene. 

Es un juego que es facilmente obnubilable en una coleccion grande y quedarse sin ver mesa, pero ni mucho menos un mal juego. recompensa las oportunidades que se le dan. no es magnifico, pero es un buen juego. 

PD. desde mediados de 2016 (cuando FFG y GWS se "divorciaron") este juego al dejar de ser producido y publicado, se ganó fama de "buscado" y con ello de "valorado" en la compraventa. En otras palabras: que ahora se vende usado mas caro que cuando se compraba nuevo, y se valora mejor ahora que cuando se fabricaba y vendia. Jolleros powah. Es un juego de 7 y de comprar a 30 pavitos si te pilla cerca y te cae simpatica la propuesta, no es un must have de 9 para comprar a 50+ expansiones aparte. La gente esta muy loca.

Reminds me of a less-balanced, more wonky Arcana--commit dudes to things to try to get stuff. There's more kinds of stuff, to be sure, but things like the cheating tokens strike me as having a bad effect on the game. I'm also doubtful of the teams' balance.

RATING: 6.5
Captures the Ameritrash, confrontational, chaotic, fiddly, luck-induced rage of Blood Bowl perfectly. I mean this in the best ways, but also as a caveat to those who don't like these type of games in general.

The game is area control, with a hint of asymmetrical play and mild taste of deckbuilding. There are 4-5 areas each turn you are trying to "win" in order to gain Fans (VP's), upgrade cards, or additional player cards for your deck. 

The famed (tackle/whiff/digger) Blood Bowl dice are here, for those of you keeping score.

In our group's sessions this game overstays its welcome slightly. The more players, the longer it gets - I worry about future expansions that may increase the number of players. 

Running time exponentially increases due to the game's fiddliness and an increasing abundance of staff and team upgrades each round, so even though it's "only" five matches, you'll be at the table at least 60 minutes, and the last match is a decathlon of checking a dozen cards for effects before, during, and after each action or die roll. Scoring gets more and more fiddly with each match as well. 

AP-prone players may not be your favorites if you play this with them.

RATING: 7
Great card game with variable player powers.  It abstracts the on the field play of the miniatures game so that you can play a whole season .  This allows a deck building mechanic, as your team upgrades from match to match.  

Combines pretty good tactical card play with a little bit of hand management and deck building.  Its really an area majority style game where your units are cards.  The game is as much about timing and card placement as it is what your cards are.  

If you are a fan of blood bowl you will love the theming.  Even if you aren't a fan, the game incorporates enough generic football terminology to make it more than just an abstract area majority card game.

Of course with six factions and a slew of upgrade cards the replayability is excellent.   

My only real complaints about the game are that it is a little long (probably solved with more experience and familiarity) and some of the victory point granting upgrade cards are strong enough to require everyone at the table to take note of them and actively try to stop players who are going that route.  I played twice and both games were dominated by those cards.  I still think its a great design.

RATING: 6
When I first heard about this game, I was intrigued. I've always liked the theme of Blood Bowl and I am big fan of Battleball. Mainly due to cost of entry, I've never played Blood Bowl, so I hoped this might scratch the same itch. Well it doesn't, but I don't think it's supposed to.

The concept of managing a team instead of actually controlling the players doing the skull-cracking sounds a bit boring by comparison. However, there is a bit more battling in here than you might think at first. The best thing mechanically about this game is the ball. Basically, battles take place by each player committing cards with various strengths to each battle. Add up the numbers, highest number wins. Simple, but boring. However, the ball really takes this up a notch. Each battle has a ball that the cards can fight over. It not only serves as two bonus points towards winning the battle, it also is a tiebreaker. Many of the special abilities on the cards revolve around taking the ball, forcing fumbles, etc. and this works very nicely.

However, I was somewhat disappointed by the lack of variety in the teams. Sure, they have different special abilities that give them a different feel, but their stats are almost all the same. Fully a third of the cards are EXACTLY the same across all teams, and there is some duplication beyond this. I think balance could have been maintained while still creating a bit more variety.

There is a minor deckbuilding element as well, which basically amounts to getting to add a random extra-good card to your deck a couple times a game. These "star player" cards are quite useful and have some special abilities not seen on any of the cards in the basic decks. I wish these would have been better integrated into the game, as they add a lot of interest to an otherwise samey game.

All in all, it's a nice effort, a good price, and some really well-written rules (no easy task in a game where players/players/plays/playing all mean different things). I just feel like it's a pretty fun game that could have been a REALLY fun game if they weren't striving so much for balance. Too much of that makes it sometimes feel like a game of adding numbers instead of a game of "kill-the-guy-with-the-ball".

Blood Bowl: Team Manager is a multi-player, multi-location tug-of-war with a lot of special power sauce slathered all over it. With that in mind, I imagine that this is best played quick, dirty, with a pint in hand, and with a sailor's mouth. While that's not how my first play went down (i.e., it was 210 minutes, over-analyzed, and in a space in which no one was too foul of mouth), I can see the potential here. I say potential because this game potentially suffers from over-analysis -- there is *so* much differing text on the cards: this is the bane of players who need to know (or the bane of players who don't like waiting for the player who "needs to know"). However, with the right group playing fast, furious, and on the edge of their seat, this could be a lot of fun. Otherwise, it becomes bogged down by its own textual weight (which makes the game feel "heavier" than its otherwise simple structure conveys).

Dropped to 6. It still is a nice middle-weight game, but the randomness is a bit too much for my taste.

The dice are already random, so why have some cards giving you a total of 5 VPs and others none..? Or a normal mercenary vs. a dwarf deathroller?

Also the teams don't seem to be that balanced anymore, the dwarfs & vampires have a very hard time winning.

The game grows on me. It seems pleasantly balanced & it's dripping with theme.

Dice combat, lot's of strategy & a bit of bluffing too.
Gotta check the expansion soon :)

GAMEPLAY
A game is broken into five rounds of highlights. Each round lets players vie for the rewards from more star players to coaching abilities to fans. Players commit a player from their hand of six to a highlight in an attempt to pick up the ball or knock down other players. Play moves smoothly through the rounds as star players enter the match and upgrades become a big influence. Upgrades range from a mercenary wizard to blast an opponent to extra training to knock someone out to rewards of fans for hurting a player. This ia a fairly strategic game with luck involved in the player deck shuffle, cheating tokens, and the dice roles for tackling opponents. The winner is the player with the most fans at the end of the fifth round.
COMPONENTS
Cards are very well designed with bright colorful and stylized art. The art is spot on blood bowl, unhinged fantasy. The card is good quality and the tokens are all thick stock. The style is spot on Blood Bowl and if you know the world you will love it.
THEME
If you enjoy blood bowl the miniatures game you will enjoy this game. Committing players to highlights is a little abstract, it doesn’t really feel like individual games played each round. There is a good struggle for control of highlights as your more powerful players get mixed in towards the later rounds.
WHO IS IT FOR?
This game should be enjoyed over a beer. It can be learned by younger players but the raucous nature of Blood Bowl is great for a casual play through with some cursing. Playing with 3 or 4 players allows everyone to win some highlights and keep the game interesting.

This is one of my favourite games, even though I'm not very good at it. I love the card play, the differences in the teams that make you have to change your strategy. 

The only reason this is a 9 rather than a 10 is because it is a little long for what it is. But I have so much fun playing it that it doesn't bother me.

I like the idea (the theme, the factions and progression of your team), I just don't really like how it plays out. I have to mention I think this just isn't my type of game, the game being kind of a heavy filler. Much too random and chaotic for me, ESPECIALLY for a game of such length. If it took less than an hour I could live with it, but not 2-3 hours.
Also, all the games I've played (one 2, one 3 and two 4-player games) have had a clear runaway leader early on (after 1-2 rounds out of five) that couldn't be caught up with. Another negative for me is the lack of long-term strategy, which is almost totally absent since most rewards you get are random. That being said, I'm probably the person I know who likes this the least... so chances are you'll like it more than I do!

OWNED SINCE 2012
I bought this game for me (father) because I really wanted the Blood Bowl game from Gameworkshop, which was out of print at the time, and decided on this as a substitute based on the many positive reviews comparing this with the GameWorkShop version. I love this game; it is quick, easy to learn, and a lot of fun and full of theme. I am glad I have this instead of the Gamesworkshop game. I would probably never be able to play the Gamesworkshop version and this one sees a lot of plays because my family also loves this game. My kids 8+ can understand the rules, and those kids 11+ understand the strategies needed to win. Win or lose, every one has fun playing this game, and it is a quick game and gets a lot of play. One of the down sides to this game is that only 4 players can play, but we  use paper to add a 5th person because everyone wants to pay it, lol. The 5th person works. It plays very different then any other game we own and I am glad to have it in my collection.

Juego de cartas que intenta simular una temporada de Blood Bowl. Se abstrae bastante de la mecánica de los partidos

Cada jugador inicia la partida con una plantilla de jugadores. Por orden irá asociando un jugador a un partido en el que pueda entrar. Al entrar el jugador hace acciones.
Una vez todos los jugadores han colocado sus jugadores se comprueba el resultado del partido otorgando puntos y otros beneficios.

Probada la expansión juego sucio. Los nuevos equipos están chulos y no desentonan con los del juego base. Especialmente simpáticos me han resultado los hobgoblins. No he probado los estadios ni el arbitro corrupto.

También probada la expansión de muerte súbita. Los equipos no desentonan con los del básico. No son tan diferentes como los de juego sucio. El añadido de los contratos es un acierto. Nos falta probar el balón encantado

Me gustó mucho la primera partida, recuerda a su hermano mayor pero sin tanta parafernaria y más rápido. Pese todo es un pelin azaroso y las partidas tienden a alargarse demasiado. Buen juego, pero podría ser mejor refinando ciertas mecánicas. Igual con las expansiones...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Trying to evolve a miniatures board game into a cards game is something very difficult to do, specially if you want to emulate the game as the original was. In this case, the designers didn't try to copy that but, instead, they created a new concept using as a base the original Blood Bowl. In the team manager version, what you do is compete against other players in different games every turn, and what is being represented is the highlight of the game: that play where the blitzer killed the quarterback or when the quarterback made the perfect pass through a bunch of rivals... that kind of stuff. I think that the idea is very interesting and, in fact, it works very well.
However, I do think that this game needs the expansions. The game improves a lot. The expansions, as far as I know, and at least in Spain, are out of stock. I do not know if they are going to be reprinted, which is a problem as I only own the core box.
Positive:
1. The theme is well implemented
2. Easy to explain
3. Great artwork
Negative:
1. Better with the expansions (which are out of stock, in Spain at least)
2. There are some number of players that do not work very well because of the amount of games available
3. It may be a bit long
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Mostly tactical game.

Fun, but too long (up to 2h) for its (light) weight, randomness, uncontrollability and too little of advanced decision-making.

I like the ideas for the mechanics, but this is - as it turns out for the zillionth time - a bit too little.  The _real_ mastery is tranforming nice ideas into a playable game with correct time/weight ratio...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I wanted to like this but the dice hated me.  I played orks and felt overwhelmed by Chaos' sheer brutality, the elves ability to steel the ball, and the human's versatility.  All of my best abilities required me to take out opponents but it just never happened.  Maybe I'll enjoy the game more as a different team but the whole thing felt chaotic in a bad way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It owes a LOT to Battle Line, really just a suped-up version to me, which is not a bad thing really, HOWEVER, I remember there being some (a little?) strategic play in BL, where as here is was almost completely tactical, and this was somewhat disappointing for me. 

I would have liked to see more decision making, though I am not sure where it would come in, I guess some DBing or the like, it is VERY light on rules however so has that going for it, and theme was pretty good even if it did not feel like football per se. 

The random cheating chits do add some unpredictability and maybe a little fun, but also as you might expect a fair size dose of luck, as does the tacking (die roll) and of course card draw (least of all though) so luck is definitely on the high side, it should play fast enough (though you might want to shorten 3 or 4 player version) to not be a deal-breaker for most, for me it might be. 

I think at the end of the day, I would probably choose BL over this even though there is some added fun/neat aspects to it and it scales 2 to 4, I should play it again though but really I now have a boatload of card games this has to compete with. 

Update: 6.5 => 6 Played again with 2 just to be sure about this. The game is very well done actually, and the theme is pretty strong, also liked it a little more with 2, though I could see how playing with 4 as two teams might be the most fun, but overall I just don't think the game is for me as too much relies on luck and is almost fully tactical.

Nice game with a lot to think about while playing it.  Got a good lead with the Chaos All Stars but got overhauled by those skippy wood elves!  Apparently we had a few details wrong, which meant a closer game second time around.  A tie for first with Skaven vs Humans.  Third game came second with Skaven, got to love those cheating rats.  First place with the Chaos All Stars in the fourth and fifth games.  Tried Humans this time, reasonable.  Do wonder if there is anything you can do to counter the "end of game FF cards".  Can easily stack into an unstoppable mass.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2012)

A very long and boring game. In theory, I should like this game a lot. However our 4 player game was very long with lots of downtime (the worst sin a game can commit in my book). I bought the game because I think it has a lot of potential, but I will only play it as a two player game. 

The game components are very good.

It is very likely that the game explainer got wrong some rules, I will play it in the near future and I will come back to re rate and re comment. I still have high hopes for this one.

At last I got to play Team manager again. It was better than last time but still not fun enough, I was expecting a better game. However the game explainer had many rules holes so I will read the rules and play it again.

I think it is best as a two player game, but I would be open to play it as a 4 player games in teams. I don’t like free for all because all the other players attack the leader and there is a lot of king making.

Fun card game played in a series of rounds. In each round each player has hand of six cards which are played alternately against one of three 'prize' cards in the middle of the table with the highest total against each prize taking that prize in a similar manner to a number of Knizia card games.

A number of twists keep it interesting, including a blizzard of special effects, a variety of creature decks with varying pros and cons, the ability to improve your deck and a tussle over holding the ball counter on the prize cards which adds two points to your score against that card if held at the end of the round.

Another praise to FFG's outstanding job on the components and art, it's once again top notch. This definitely is a straight forward beer & pretzels game. It uses some minor area control and deck building mechanics and relies heavily on its theme to bring the fun into the game. It also comes with a large dose of randomness and 'take that'. A four player game can last two hours. That is very lengthy, bordering to outstaying its welcome, considering the lightness and chaos in this game. 

Now is it me, or did the [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40692/small-world]dwarves[/url] once again drew the short straw during the moment all the cool powers were handed out.

It isn't Blood Bowl, but it's a pretty good game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
IN BBTM, you play out 5 "weeks" of games. Highlight and tournament cards become the fields of play and define rewards for each match up. Players play to either side of the highlights and tournament cards. In a 4-player game, players each compete on two of four highlight match ups. All four teams can play to a tournament. You draw a hand of six cards and on your turn you either pick a new matchup or strengthen a position you already have. Player cards have a "Star Power" as well as defined abilities and skills. All are executed when the card is played. Players also may have support cards they earned in previous rounds that they can play to help. If you win a match up, rewards are defined on the card. It can be additional fans, team upgrades, star players, and so on. This leads to good variety from one round to the next as new things come into play.

It's not a complicated or "thinky" game, by any means. It is a romp going head-to-head with the other asymmetrical races and teams. Your race and card abilities give you clues as to how to play them and creates a lot of great atmosphere. You are trying to gain more fans, not necessarily win games. It helps top win, but fans can be acquired in many ways. This is a well-designed game of stupid fun that I'll play any time!

Kind of a take-that card game that involves a small amount of drafting/deck building, all themed around a bloody football game played by different fantasy races.
On paper, it didn't seem the kind of game I'd particularly be into. But in actually playing it, I loved it. It reminded me a bit of Chaos Marauders, although I liked this one better. I really got into the theme, and they went all out here, with awesome awesome art, tons of flavor text and theme-related mechanisms. It's got your typical FFG chrome-heavy rules, so you need someone to know the rules well, especially as you get late in the game and have a lot of card interactions. Don't try to play this out of the box. One of the cool things is each team has its own strengths and weaknesses, thematic to its race (orcs, chaos demons, humans, elves, etc), with its own customized team upgrade deck.

Boring.....painted on theme.  Bloodbowl fans are starved for any attention to the game so they might love this.  I was one of them who was so excited when this game was announced as a surprise release.  Bought it at Gen Con before trying it (I knew it would sell out).  Played my friends copy and my reaction was: This is it...really?

I am glad some people are enjoying this but seriously consider trying this out before buying it.

First off, this is NOT a deckbuilding game. This wasn't really unexpected, because of the whole major rehaul thing, so it didn't surprise me. (There are a few deckbuilding elements, but it's very possible to only go through your player deck a couple times in the game, so it's not the focus.)

What's there is a lot of fun. It's like Battle Line + Blood Bowl with upgrades up the wazoo. 2p is a neat back-and-forth and 4p is a great battle royal. Both our games were won by the player who best managed his upgrades, which makes complete sense.

This was a pleasant surprise - 4 player game, felt like I had a lot of control and some good strategic decisions to make. Players who don't like the push your luck aspect can play one of the non-cheating races.

Lots of fun, plays in an hour. Reports of 3.5 hour games... I think i'd need to be drinking heavily if it lasted that long!

RATING: 8.5
I love this game!  Death Sport board games are very, very appealing to me & this game fits the bill beautifully.  The only reason I give it a rating of "8.5" is due to the fact there aren't enough teams to choose from, extra Highlight cards & Headline & Tournament cards in the "Spike! Magazine" deck.  But, with that said, this IS FF Games so I'm sure the expansion sets are lining up for release as I write this.  The concept is fantastic--managing a team within the BB League, with emphasis not only on Team Match-Ups, but Staff upgrades & drafting Star Players as well.  This brings so much more to the BB League world through card-play, deck-building & dice chucking.  The goal is not how many Match-ups you win, but how man FANS your team acquires over a 5 week season.  Again, this makes the game so cool & with the death sport theme, even cooler!  If you are already a BB fan (or a fan of Elfball, GavBall or DreadBall), then you must pick up this game.  When I get the SUDDEN DEATH expansion, I'm sure this game will rise to a rating of "9" or "10".

Blood Bowl: Team Manager takes place in the Warhammer universe, has excessive fantasy artwork, features tug-of-war gameplay. Many red signals but I like it. The teams play so differently that I want to get the expansions. No matter, that I will likely play it only once every couple of years.

Expanding your team, fighting multiple challenges at once and watching the rolls of fate is fun enough without being mindless to make this a good game.

I'm not sure why I keep trying FFG titles - this is pretty much what I expected, a lot of chrome piled on top of a relatively simple idea. For those that are invested in the Blood Bowl universe or enjoy fantasy themes, this probably goes a long way. For me, the theme is a liability and doesn't make it any more fun.

Second, the rules (for a non-FFG player like me) are too complicated for what is essentially a really simple game. More importantly, the play time is too long for a game with this much randomness. There might be a game I would enjoy here, but it would require a retheme and some simplification, but then you would end up with Battle Line/Schotten Totten.

RATING: 7.5
This is a card game based on the Bloodbowl universe. Surprisingly deeper and more tactical than I first assumed. There's a lot to consider. Broken down to bare mechanics, I would say that essentially this is a bidding game. Player bid "footballers" of various strengths to win prizes, which can be taken as Fan Factor (VPs) or new tactics or new players.

Its quite exciting and tense, but personally ran a bit too long for me. Towards the end game, everyone had so many cards in front of them that it was hard to track who had which powers. I'd prefer a quicker, less cluttered game.

Love this game - I loved the Miniature game to death (own 1st to 3rd Edition) and even managed a few leagues back in the days.

The card game manages to provide the core experience while giving you some funny moments if taken as "season highlights" and not a simulation of a matchup (which it isn't trying to achieve) - so basically instead of playing one season of 4 to 6 games and then going for play-offs/finals, this lets you simulate several seasons and then see who "wins" in the end. A pity FFG lost the license, since I don't believe GW will ever produce any expansion or reprints of this fabulous game.

No game has frustrated me more than this game has.  It's an interesting game and certainly there is a paucity of good football games (1st & Goal, Blood Bowl).  This game will only grow better with expansions and more teams but frankly I don't enjoy the it enough to suggest playing it again.  I think the teams that cheat have a distinct advantage over rule abiding teams (I've played the Humans both times and got beat down; I think last place in both games I've played).  And I found I tired of the game and was hoping for it to end a round earlier than it did.

Pretty simple (though it doesn't look that way) card game. I enjoyed it despite not liking pigskin-ball ;)

Every week there are certain highlights we're striving for and either an event or a tournament. After every turn you grow stronger by changing your team's roster, getting upgrades, etc.

Good ballplay, cheating and tackling will get you the fans you're all fighting for.

Nice art as well. I like that Wood Elves are a base game faction.

Basically Knizia's Battle Line combined with a Deck building mechanic along with a kitchen sink assortment of modifiers that makes the game a bloated hot mess.  Loads of fiddly little cards, dice and crap.  A totally adolescent theme is solely intended to capture the attention of the geeks. (Go figure it is in the BGG Top 200!)

Stick with Knizia's Battle Line and throw this game away.

Game mechanics are really good and every game we play is lots of fun!
Unfortunately, Chaos and - especially - Dwarfs are quite underpowered. The latter can be a bit boring, especially when playing against teams from the expansions.
The exact opposite can be said about the Humans. Not the strongest team that will win a lot of highlights but their Team Upgrades are sick when it comes to hoarding Fans. And in the end it's all about getting Fans...

Comment written after only one game played.

The game comes with a lot of good quality and beautifully illustrated material.

Also, there are 6 different teams in the base game (and 3 more in the first expansion) so this makes for much variety.

At first the elves seemed very strong as for their ability to draw a lot of cards but the scoring difference ended to be very low because of the large influence of luck.

What frustrated me the most was to win some battles, not by being better than my opponent but because he had no luck in drawing "cheats" for the orcs.

This is exactly something I would expect from fantasy flight. Very nice components, nice art, overall nice design, but the game itself is lacking. I don't know if fantasy flights strategy is to publish lots of mediocre games, and sell them by creaming them with nice components. Nevertheless, game is somewhat luck oriented card game where players try to fry each other in blood bowl fields. Lots of player interaction, which is expected if the only thing in the game is smacking other players. Nothing spectacular in my books, but still I think it's one of those better FF games. Would play again.

Own it and played it a bunch of times.  It's a killer Blood Bowl game, no doubt about it!  Very easy, streamlined, and well balanced for a FFG small game.  If you're a fan of the GW Blood Bowl, this is a very scaled down version without all the complexities of the miniatures' version.  Out of the box, it's very playable and doesn't really need an expansion.  Although it would be fun to have more teams in the future (like Amazon, Vampires, etc).  This is definitely going to be a heavily played game with our gaming group!  Sure to be an ameritrash favorite.

LIKES:

* Really enjoyable deckbuilding game of a sort where you fight in a couple matches for different rewards.  
* Victory in a match were variable and you could go for strategy cards, star players, or points.
* Each player deck has certain tendencies which are unique to the race.
* The different athlete cards have differing abilities which can effect a match in very different ways.  
* This game has lots of expansion possibilities.  
* Dice are involved in a pretty solid way where you play the percentages if you choose to tackle, etc...
* "Cheating is required" - you have to like a game where this in typed in the instructions...:-)  Of course, cheating is a specific mechanic involved with the "evil" races and can be both good or bad.

DISLIKE:

* Some of the strategy cards seem a bit overpowered compared to others.  
* Game may overstay its welcome by around 30 minutes...particularly on your first play or two as you figure out the text on the cards and/or have AP players involved.

Now this little gem is a tight card game where the whole is much larger than the just the sum of its parts. At its heart Blood Bowl is a simple area majority game where each area is competed over in a number of rounds (usually four or five). Games can move very quickly, especially with players who know what they are doing. The opportunity to make your team what you want it to based on your winning (and even just competing) in some competitions offer a variety to the game. Each team has its own strengths and weaknesses that the player will do well to heed during a game (both yours and your opponents). The components are all high quality (per usual with FFG) and the graphic layout of the components are also well done. Overall the game hums along at a really nice brisk pace, and has a ton of interesting choices to make and a nice dash of randomness that will make every matchup thrilling. Definitely looking forward to trying the expansions as well.

* Components
+ Very good components
+ The tokens were very easy to punch out
- The card drawings are a little dark
$ The cards seem good enough.  I prefer a linen finish to their glossy finish, as it feels like it makes for more robust cards, but these are fine.
+ The insert has the right size.

* After a first game:

I found the game to be quite light, with not so many difficult decisions; much lighter than Schotten-Totten, Memoire 44 (where to move which troops is often not obvious), Claustrophobia (choosing where to go, whether to split the group or not, how to use the dice, etc. require some thoughts),….  However, we did not play optimally, as we forgot to use our Upgrades (Team or Staff), so there *is* something to learn (I look forward to this).

The game was entertaining enough, but felt really too light to be very interesting, for me.  Maybe it could become more interesting if I paid more attention to the distribution of players (which players were played, which are to come).  I should also try to better use the special abilities (including taking into account my opponent's).

Jeder Spieler wählt eine Rasse und bekommt ein entsprechendes Kartendeck dafür. In der Runde spielen die Spieler abwechselnd Karten zu Turnieren aus (ein Team rechts, ein anderes links). Wer am Ende der Runde die höchste Stärke im Turnier hat, erhält Belohnungen (Siegpuinkte, Neue Spieler, Sonderfähigkeiten).
Der Spieler mit den meissten Fans (SP) gewinnt das Spiel nach einer vorgegebenen Anzahl Runden.
Manche Rassen sind scheisse! Das ist ein Spiel, das man wirklich sehr oft spielen muss um auch die Rassen alle mal kennenzulernen. Jede spielt sich etwas anders. Meine sind nur gut, wenn sie auf dem Boden liegende Spieler hat, was ich aber zu vermeiden suche... Naja, nächstes mal wirds wieder eine andere Rasse werden ;)

I've never played the actual Blood Bowl game. I have no interest whatsoever in football, even (and especially) if it includes elves. Dan, my opponent, is exactly the same. Yet we both had a really good time playing this. I was the Eye Gougers and he was the Wood Elves. It's fast and fun, and wildly chaotic. You can and will get screwed by luck (I certainly did). But who cares? It's a grand time. It reminded me a lot of Campaign Manager 2008, which I liked but had a few things going against it. One, it abstracted its theme a little too much, unlike this one which abstracts it just enough, I think. Two, CM2008 made me think about Sarah Palin, which this game does not. Three, BBTM allows for more than two players, and I'm kind of curious to see how that works.

Fútbol americano táctico,azaroso,tramposo y divertido protagonizado por las razas más conocidas del mundo Warhammer: elfos, enanos, orcos, skaven, caos y humanos; 6 razas distintas con diferentes formas de entender y practicar este deporte. Esto es lo que vas a encontrar en este juego en el que cada jugador representa a un entrenador de un equipo de indeseables y facinerosos con un único objetivo: ser el mejor en su profesión gracias al atraer el mayor número de hinchas posible a su equipo.
Un juego más profundo de lo que parece en un principio y con más factor suerte del que uno desearía, pero un buen juego, sesudo y divertido al tiempo, del que sin duda no tardarán en aparecen expansiones con más razas disponibles; expansiones que por otra parte este humilde jugador comprará debido a la buena impresión que el juego le ha causado.

Digo táctico porque cada equipo tiene sus puntos fuertes y débiles y la pericia del jugador consiste en sacar el mayor beneficio de los primeros y el menor perjuicio de los segundos, utilizando en el momento más adecuado tal o cual carta de jugador y sabiendo elegir con tiento qué tipo de "momentos estelares" se ajusta más a las necesidades de su equipo y de la situación en la que se encuentra en cada momento.

Nota 1: Hay diferencias entre ser ó no el jugador inicial de una ronda; según qué razas son más productivas cuando van a rebufo y menos cuando deben llevar la iniciativa; por eso, el jugador debe elegir un tipo de "momentos estelares" con mayores hinchas en la parte central de estas cartas cuando tiene mayores posibilidades de victoria y debe elegir otros "momentos estelares" más conservadores cuando se encuentre en una situación en la que el orden de los turnos le desfavorezca.
También debe tener en cuenta a la hora de seleccionar los "momentos estelares" qué tipos de recompensa de zona debe elegir; unas zonas que compensen los puntos débiles del equipo sería lo ideal, ya que aunque se pierda la recompensa central la de zona siempre se tiene mientras el jugador tenga al menos un personaje en ese momento estelar.
Está claro también que si un jugador tiene amplia ventaja en hinchas respecto a sus rivales, una buena estrategia puede ser elegir momentos estelares donde las recompensas no sean grandes cantidades de hinchas; de esta manera mantiene su ventaja mientras opta a reforzar su equipo para próximas rondas.
Por otro lado, un equipo que va atrás en el marcador necesita todo lo contrario; elegir momentos estelares en los que las recompensas sean de hinchas; así podrá recortar distancias con respecto a sus rivales.
Nota 2:¡IMPORTANTE! Repito, el orden del turno de jugadores es vital, ya que algunas razas funcionan mejor cuando deben defender una posición que cuando deben atacarla. Por eso es importante conocer las limitaciones y ventajas de cada raza.

Digo azaroso porque el azar está muy presente. Por un lado en el lanzamiento de dados y por otro en las fichas de trampa.
En cada uno de los dos dados hay un 50% de posibilidades de que un placaje tenga éxito, luego mala pata aparte es un factor que favorece bastante a las razas con alto potencial ofensivo si no durante toda la partida sí al menos al principio (las 2 primeras rondas), lo que por otro lado puede ser suficiente si en esas 2 rondas esos equipos han obtenido suficiente ventaja; en las siguientes rondas deben preocuparse de mantener esa distancia.
Las fichas de trampa son 30 y de ellas sólo 6 son negativas (20%), ya que suponen la expulsión de un jugador de un enfrentamiento; 4 son inocuas y 20 positivas. Una bendición más que una maldición que de nuevo favorece a las razas ofensivas que suelen ser las que más fichas de trampas roban durante el juego.
Para minimizar un poco el factor de las fichas de trampa lo que he decidido ha sido lo siguiente: una ficha de trampa que ha sido usada no se devuelve a la pila de reserva al inicio de la siguiente ronda, sino que se aparta; de esta manera aumentan las posibilidades de que salgan las fichas de expulsión a medida que avanza la partida y se van robando más fichas de trampas; y parece lógico pensar que a más trampas haga un equipo más posibilidades tiene de que el árbitro les pille in fraganti cometiendo alguna pillería. En el caso hipotético de que se hubieran usado todas las fichas de trampa antes de terminar la partida lo que hay que hacer es barajarlas todas de nuevo y formar una nueva reserva.

Nota 3: Está claro que a más cartas de mejora de equipo y de cuadro técnico y jugadores estrella tenga un equipo más posibilidades tendrá de obtener una victoria, por lo que debe ser algo a tener presente en la elección de los momentos estelares, pero siempre teniendo en cuenta que deben servir además para compensar las carencias que tengan un equipo o bien reforzar alguna de sus virtudes.
Algunas razas necesitan de forma más imperiosa que otras algunas de estas 3 características; intentaré reflejarlo en mi análisis de las razas.

RAZAS

Caos:
Raza ofensiva y equilibrada ya que en una misma carta de jugador tienen tanto habilidades de placaje, pase y trampa; por lo tanto pueden hacer un placaje al rival, hacer que este caiga derribado reduciendo sus puntos de estrellato y soltando el balón, que luego pueden coger con su habilidad de pase. El único inconveniente es que roban muchas fichas de trampa y pueden resultar expulsados, pero ya hemos visto que tampoco es algo demasiado negativo.
Es una raza que funciona bien tanto si es la primera del turno en entrar en acción (tienen la habilidad de pase que les otorga la posesión del balón) como si van por detrás (te placan y te roban el balón).
Es probable que ganen la primera ronda del juego, en la que deberían optar por momentos estelares que les otorgaran el mayor número posible de hinchas para tener un cojín con respecto a sus rivales, pero seleccionando zonas de juego propias que además les otorguen mejoras de equipo y cuadro técnico que siempre son necesarias.
Creo que deberían optar por los jugadores estrella y las mejoras de cuadro técnico.

Elfos:
Equipo limpio que no hace trampas, lo que es más un inconveniente que ventaja. El equipo está desequilibrado ya que algunos jugadores únicamente hacen placaje y otros únicamente realizan pases de balón, pero no ambas cosas en la misma carta, luego pueden hacer un placaje al rival pero como mucho devuelven el balón al centro del campo (pero no a sus manos) y si consiguen el balón mantienen de pie a los rivales con todos sus puntos de estrellato, lo que hace que los rivales lo tengan más fácil a la hora de ganar los torneos y momentos estelares.
No es un equipo que funcione bien cuando es el primero en actuar; debe reservar sus jugadores de placaje para el final si no quiere desperdiciar esa habilidad, por lo que se ve obligado a utilizar a sus jugadores de pase en primer momento. De esta forma los rivales podrán placarles fácilmente y robarles el balón. Posteriormente los elfos podrán utilizar sus jugadores de placaje pero ya no podrán recuperar la posesión del balón y esos valiosos +2 a los puntos de estrellato que otorga. En estos turnos es perferible que los elfos estén preparados para perder sus rondas y elijan momentos estelares con zonas centrales que no otorguen demasiados hinchas pero que tengan zonas de juego propias que sí los otorguen para así ganar algún hincha; tampoco viene nunca mal una zona de juego propia que otorgue jugadores estrella, ya que éstos son especialmente importantes para esta raza ya que pueden compensar el desequilibrio que padecen.
Los turnos en los que van por detrás los elfos funcionan mejor, ya que en un primer momento pueden intentar un placaje y antes de terminar la ronda pueden intentar robar el balón al rival y ganar la bonificación de +2 de cara a la fase de marcador y así intentar asegurarse la victoria. En estos turnos es cuando los Elfos deben intentar conseguir más hinchas en torneos y momentos estelares.
Sus mejoras deben ser jugadores estrella y cartas de mejoras de ambos tipos.

Skaven:
Son una versión más débil pero más rápida de los ejércitos del Caos, ya que son menos tramposos y menos ofensivos. Aunque tienen personajes que hacen placajes no suelen tener la habilidad de pase; las habilidades de pase están concentradas en otras cartas que tienen 2 pases seguidos y que además tienen la habilidad de "Esquivar" que hacen repetir el lanzamiento de dados de un rival que les intente placar.
Son parecidos a los elfos pero con habilidades de ataque mejores, luego al igual que éstos van bien en turnos en los que van por detrás pero no van del todo mal si juegan en primer lugar porque la habilidad esquivar les da una segunda oportunidad ante los ataques rivales.
Tienen buenas habilidades de equipo, que hay que potenciar en cuanto sea posible en las zonas de juego propias de los momento estelares. Los jugadores estrella también serán bien recibidos.

Enanos:
Apenas tienen personajes con la habilidad de pase,luego es poco probable que tengan el balón en sus manos; este factor queda compensado con la habilidad "Mantenerse firme" que evita que sus jugadores sean placados mientras sean portadores del balón. Por tanto, frente a equipos con pocos jugadores de pase puede ser el factor desequilibrante. El poder de estrellato de los enanos de placaje tampoco es demasiado elevado, luego tampoco son demasiado efectivos, pero... 
Tienen 1 ventaja: cuando son derribados el poder de estrellato tiene escasa merma, luego ofrecen una buena resistencia a la hora de dejar escapar torneos y momentos estelares. Debido a este hecho pueden arriesgarse a atacar a jugadores rivales que tengan poder de estrellato mayor que ellos. La habilidad "Defensa" de muchos de ellos potencia este aspecto.
Sus jugadores estrella tienen la habilidad de pase y sus mejoras de equipo son bastante buenas, luego son un equipo robusto difícil de vencer.

Orcos:
Equipo equilibrado que realiza trampas de forma moderada y buenos placajes, factor en el que destacan y que hay que potenciar con sus cartas de mejora de equipo. Aunque no tiene demasiados jugadores con pase (lo que puede suponer un problema frente a equipos que retengan el balón),los que tiene usan la habilidad "Manos seguras" que les hace resistentes a las pérdidas del balón. Aún así es muy recomendable conseguir cuanto antes jugadores estrella que remedien esta carencia.
Algunos jugadores además tienen habilidades que reportan hinchas al herir o derribar a sus rivales, aspecto que permite sumar buenos PV a lo largo de la partida.
Funcionan bien tanto si juegan en primer como en segundo lugar.

Humanos:
Su punto fuerte son los jugadores que al placar con éxito reciben la propiedad del balón.Esto compensa que sus jugadores de pase no son de los mejores del juego. El problema es que el valor de estrellato de esos jugadores es de 3, luego placar y quitar el balón a jugadores de valor 3 ó 4 de puntos de estrellato rivales se antoja algo difícil, por lo que dicha habilidad sólo es efectiva ante rivales no demasiado duros.
Es una raza que funciona mejor cuando va al rebufo y peor cuando tiene que tomar la iniciativa.
Sus mejoras de equipo priman la posesión del balón, luego son recomendables, pero lo son más la necesidad de obtener más jugadores estrella con mejores capacidades tanto físicas como de pase.

RATING: 9
Well, it's a little box, but the game is huge.

There is some luck factor involved, but it's not THAT much important. I'm myself a very unlucky dice roller (i know that statistically it shouldn't exist, but play a game against me and you'll start believing so!), but I NEVER lost a single game in BloodBowl, so strategy (a grand plan, usually crafted around the first upgrade cards you receive) and tactic (the instant decisions and analysis meant to let you choose the right card to play your guys on, or how to pass, which cards to combine to have a solid answer to the opponent's abilities...) comes into play heavily. 

The components are top quality, the teams are fun and feel really different, even if they aren't perfectly balanced, but it could really be a good way to help new players to start the game. 

Lenght is ok, don't expect to finish it in a couple of turns, but it won't waste all your night, either.

In the end, one of the best surprises I had in the boardgaming world.

A solid 9! (because I will give 10 only to the TOP game of my collection)

It's an interesting variation of battle line mechanics.  Different players play their "troops" on different parts of the line, activating game effects when they do so that disable opponent's troops, move stuff around, or seize "the ball".  The ball is worth extra points, and some mechanics interact with the ball carrier.

The gameplay is a lot like Smash Up.

Pro:  

Captures Blood Bowl theme well
Has same fickle luck swings as the board game
Interesting decisions and opportunities for card management     

Con:

No skull symbol on the block dice--an 'X'?  Really?
Nearly impenetrable rules
Seemingly unnecessarily fiddly and repetitious
Takes 90 to 120 minutes to play a game
Seems to have runaway leader and loser issues
Not convinced teams are well-balanced

Overall, I really want to like the game, but haven't enjoyed it due to runaway leader and length of play issues.  I'd rather play Innovation or Glory to Rome, if I want some euro-cardy-chaotic mechanics.

This game was a very pleasant surprise. It's not something I would have normally picked up but I played it at a convention and was hooked. You are fighting for the highlights of the week to be in your favor using your team cards. The teams are pretty distinct as well with some unique powers. There is also a deck building element that helps you improve your team. The way the cards play is very fun. Some cards are good at tacking opposing players for example, some are great at getting the ball. Some cards are guards that help protect your ball carrier. Just a really well done game that's very engaging.

Dense, very thematic, and possibly even better than my first impression of it, because two players are probably not the optimum number. At least I doubt whether such a complete thrashing of one player (final score was 46 to 16 or something horrible like that) is possible with more teams thrown into the fracas.

Everything else appeals a lot: great silly illustrations, relatively painless rules with just the right amount of chrome, good differentation between the various teams, and - perhaps most importantly - a sense of progression throughout the whole game due to getting Star Players on board and improving your team in other ways.

If my guess that this is considerably better with three or four players should hold true, I’ll certainly improve my rating, but even for two, this is a very enjoyable and nasty little game.

Was my favorite 'sports' game until Baseball Highlights came along.  

You shouldn't take this game too seriously.  There's quite a bit of take that and chaos in the game.  Just try to manage the chaos as best as you can so you can come out on top.  Playing optimally won't guarantee you the win in this one, but you'll still do pretty darn well.

All the teams play differently, which is great.  Gives you variety and a reason to play over and over.

Adding in all of the expansion rules is a bit much, but picking and choosing what you want to use is nice.

With no prior Blood Bowl experience, I wasn't sure what to expect from this. I was pleasantly surprised: It's a meaty game (meatier than it looks from its slim little box) full of interesting decisions -- and chaos. Lots of chaos, die rolls, and gambles, but all implemented well in that you have an enjoyable amount of control over it.

As a big fan of the WFRP world, I love that every team's flavor comes out so clearly in its deck and play style. Based on one play, they all seem solid. Flavor across the board is good, too, especially the star players.

Surprise comebacks are entirely possible, the cheating is a hoot, and everything seems to scale well based on player count. Good stuff!

3 / 5 - Good

Sold medium-light card game that bizarrely manages, with the help of some clever mechanics, cool art and flavour text, to actually feel more like Blood Bowl that Blood Bowl does. It's biggest fault is a nasty tension between wanting to analyse and the desperate need to keep the game playing quickly. Once you've overcome that, which may take a few games, it's a delight. Scales better than I was expecting too with 2-player being entirely worthwhile.

Christmas gets some game this year with Team Manager.  A quick read through of the rules and the men are at it for the first Blood Bowl game in what might be a long series of games.  Both boys (12 and 10) like the game and have a blast reading the flavor text.  The adults, me and an uncle, both really enjoyed it as well.  Seems we have a bit of team rivalry going since we seemed to match up in the highlights quite a few times. Uncle B was the big weenie with 45 points.  A definite fun time and a good purchase!

In Blood Bowl: Team Manager - The Card Game players loosely take on the roll of general managers of fantasy inspired football teams.  The goal is to be the team that generates the most fans by the end of the game.  

Using a card drafting mechanic players will make their teams (read: hand of cards) better to increase their chance of victory over their opponents.  On a player's turn, they will play a card out to "highlight" cards in the middle of the table.  This is similar to playing cards to bases in Smashup. After players' hands are exhausted points will be counted up at each of the highlight cards.  The player with the most points wins the majority of benefits of that card.  There are also tournament cards which are similar to highlight cards, but give greater benefits.

Play goes on for five rounds.  The final round includes the "Blood Bowl".  Again, whomever has the most fans at the end wins.

Blood Bowl: Team Manager - The Card Game is silly fun.  It's neat to play your player cards up against your opponent's and see what happens.  There's usually a tug-of-war that happens over a football at each highlight card that you are squared off over.  Having said that I didn't feel like I was compelled to play it again soon.  It's a nice game to bring out every so often.

I really enjoy the contest mechanic - involves some tough choices about placement and just edging out your opponent while not over committing to any specific contest (much like Battle Line).

Some of the teams seemed stronger than others at first (especially Chaos). Even if this is the case (and it is not just a question of learning the appropriate strategies), then it means that the game can be made to be more balanced when experienced players are teaching the game to others.

After only one play, definitely need to play more.

Very swingy.  I was able to triple my score on the last highlight reel, basically by drawing random cards and getting lucky with "End of Game" events.  It's hard to plan for that kind of thing.

Extremely miffed that they used classic Blood Bowl terms (Sure Hands, Guard, etc) in a manner that has no relation to the original game.

Great adaptation of the miniature game to card game. I am not convinced about the balance between teams, and there is a problem with the game length: the game is long, but the turns are few. As a result, while you play and enjoy yourself, the game is over before you manage to actually build your own team - it feels like a deck builder but it isn't.

This game obviously has taken it's theme from the original games workshop's Blood Bowl

BB - Team Manager is almost nothing like the original game when you think of the mechanics, but the game offers the same kind of feeling you get from blood bowl.
Wacky stuff happens here and there, outcomes are not that obvious given the random nature of the game.
It doesn't offer a deep strategy to aim for, but you more often than not win if you play well.

It also sees playtime with people who are not that heavy gamers.

Great mini blood bowl!

All the classic Bloodbowl elements are here but very little of the choice or strategy. Unfortunately the game takes just as long to play as the original without creating the same memorable moments and exciting tension! 

The game may be at its best with 4 players but I've found it lacking with two.

I should really care about my players but because I have no control over when they play (appear in my hand) I feel nothing. It feels like I don't have the power or tools necessary to be an affective coach.

The game game has inherited many of the usual FFG flaws: poorly written rules when it comes to timing of response events and the usual poorly designed box insert.

I am a big fan of all things Warhammer (and 40K), so I love the theme in this game.  The game play, and cards, seem to capture that Blood Bowl \ fantasy setting quite well.

It is easy to learn, and doesn't take long to play.  There is quite a bit of luck involved, but it fits with the theme, and the light-nature of the game.

The components are also well done, and the art is fantastic, which is the FFG standard.  

I do find mixing players from different teams \ races a bit odd, especially with no penalties.

We are no fans (to say the least) of football, Blood Bowl or the Warhammer universe in general, so it's hard to say that we are blinded by the theme... Yet the game delivers, thanks to the solid, strategic gameplay. Managing six cards in a kinda trick-taking game, which requires good timing is a good core. The random elements keep it fresh without ruining any planning ([i]with using the Salary Cap, ditching the unbalanced cards[/i]).

Fantasy Football set in a violent fantasy world. What's not to love? Each team plays quite differently. Fast action, but gives you a lot of choices.

RATING: 7
Reasonably fun deck building game with direct player confrontation. Mechanics integrated well with theme and retains Games Workshop's trademark luck-based core and dice randomisation to good effect. The four different factions plays and feels differently from each other. Suffers from slight runaway leader syndrome, several different bonus draw piles that are relatively undifferentiated, too high dependency on luck when drawing the star players that build the deck, strange shifts in game rhythm when players must show and read drawn cards, and an somewhat convoluted and anti-climactic end-game score tallying.

A fun game, although it doesn't scale well for 2 players. When played with 3 and 4 players we've had fun. Interesting way to bring the Blood Bowl boardgame theme into a card game.

My biggest complaint is the length of the season. The game is ending about the time your team is developed enough to show personality and let your advancing choices matter. It would be possible to play more rounds in a game but then play length would be an issue.

RATING: 6
We got one rule wrong in our play, which allowed me to pull away and win a big victory. However, knowing now what we did wrong, I can see how this is a pretty good game.

It doesn't have an extremely effective football feel to it: It's a card-management game. But the back and forth and the special powers of the players gives it a dynamic, tense feel that I enjoyed.

I would certainly play it again and wouldn't mind owning it.

seemed about a turn too long for what it is ?  some interesting mechanics for a multiplayer card game.  i guess it fits in the blood bowl universe.  could use more thought as a deck building game with a very limited # of cards in your deck which means there is probably more strategy here than at first glance.

not a very high fun factor for me.

Excellent and light Blood Bowl themed game with lots of interaction and fun. The game manages the seemingly difficult job of making a multi-player game that has all flavour of a Blood Bowl season (cheating, tackling, ball handling, fans, coaching etc). Players compete to amass the greatest number of fans as the season progresses through a series of match-ups between individual players. The results of each match up or tournament give players fans, star players or upgrades that can be used in future match-ups.

Very fun as a 2-player game. It's a tug of war over a few different objectives a la Battle Line or Magnate. The factions feel and play differently, and the star players add a touch of customization.

No one enjoyed this as much as I did, so I sold it.

RATING: 5
Better than Blood Bowl, sure. Too much of a chaotic tug-of-war for me, though. I'll play this, sure, but won't suggest. I suppose the two-player game might make most sense to me. With four players, the game is too chaotic.

Indifferent.

What a supremely fun card-game that does a great job of simulating an entire season! Nice asymmetry to the various teams, plenty of interesting choices, and just enough chance so as to accurately simulate the luck of actual football games.

Ihr wollt Eure Mitspieler mal so richtig ärgern und nerven?! Konfrontation ist Euer Ding?! Ihr gebt einenDreck auf kooperative Spiele?!
Dann solltet Ihr unbedingt einmal Blood Bowl: Team Manager spielen!
Das Stand-alone Kartenspiel bedient sich natürlich dem Szenario von Warhammer Fantasy, in dem Mannschafften von Menschen, Zwergen und Orks in einer blutigen Football-Variante aufeinander treffen. Jeder Spieler sieht sich zu Beginn des Spiels ein Team aus. In unterschiedlichen Matches, müssen nun die eigenen Spieler geschickt eingesetzt werden, um möglichst viele Belohnungen zu bekommen. Zusätzliche "Star"-Spieler werten den eigenen Spielerkader auf, ebenso Team- und Personalverbesserungen. So entsteht ein verbissener Kampf, bei dem sich die Spieler nichts gönnen. Am Ende gewinnt der Spieler, dessen Mannschaft die meisten Fans sammeln konnte. Blood Bowl ist knallhart, taktisch tiefsinnig und einfach nur "Voll auf die Omme" ! Ich liebe es :-)

One of only a few card driven games I've thoroughly enjoyed enough to want to come back to again and again!

Yes I'm already a big fan of the Blood Bowl miniatures game, but in fairness this could have been a reason for hating it just as much as it could have been for liking it (as I'm technically the harder fan to please)!

I'm reminded of FFG's Space Hulk Deathwing card game but with deeper, more strategic rules- players play against each other to score the most points for different rewards. Fans (victory points) are most important, but getting star players, special coaching and training cards can also help towards assuring victory.

Quite light with both an acceptable level of randomness and good chance for strategy, combined with a theme that captures the essence of Blood Bowl very well without leaving the uninitiated out of the loop.

Can go on just a little too long for what it is (some of our games have stretched to the 3 hour mark), but nobody really seems to notice it which is a good sign!

Surprising balance between the different teams for FFG too.

The available expansions bring a plethora of additional teams and lots of extra rules to make the game more chaotic and fiddly. I'm not sure all things are necessary, but it's at least fun to have the extra team options.

At first I thought the expansion teams' extra rules and abilities would make them more powerful, but repeated plays has seen them beaten by the vanilla teams on more then one occasion so balance seems to be ok for the moment.

Neat, neat system. Played two three-player games and they were both enjoyable. Unfortunately, the winner of one game was a failure on the field but won through more support cards and bonuses, which I wasn't too fond of. But all in all: fun.

A very well made game. We have played this game quite a bit and every time it is interesting to see what happens. No one consistently wins, sometimes people roll absolutely horrid deciding matches and plays quite smoothly even with 2 players.

Although I never played the original miniatures game beyond an intro session, moons ago, this feels like it MUST replicate it well!

A fast paced, worker placement / deck builder hybrid that re-enacts the vicious world of sports in The Old World.  Each faction feels very different from the others and brings some flavour from their Warhammer Fantasy Battle roots to the field.

Don't let the high fantasy setting keep you from trying a great game!

I rate this one a "meh", and I don't really know what to say about it. It felt like the person who was doing good in the beginning could do pretty much whatever he wanted later in the game. He had a bunch of tactics and star players, and we each only had a one or two. I felt like it was a lost cause for me to even catch up. Because of this, I was ready for the game to be over after round two, and felt kind of annoyed that I had to under two more rounds, even though four rounds seems like a good number for the game. I just didn't have much fun during it, and I didn't see many interesting (to me) points of strategy in the game. I'd probably give it another try, not in the near future, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game. Hope there will be an expansion out soon, though I'd like more stuff, and not so much more rules and types of different cards as the fantasy flight tendensy seem to go towards. (Look at Arkham Horror full sets, I was thankful for the latest set that just brought more stuff and no more rules)

We enjoyed it, it played well, and the theme fitted the mechanics and you got the feeling you were a manager.

Some cards need a bit of balancing I think, though. The Orcs and their injuring people seemed to get fans too easily compared with the other teams.

After second playing I like it even more. The two games were very different, and having a mix of 6 different races is fun. The only thing that doesn't make this game a 10, is the fact that one cannot use this as a filler game, because of time consumption. If it could be boiled down to 30mins/1 hour without losing the fun of the game, then it would be perfect.
Doesn't matter I like it as is.

This one catches the feel of the actual board and miniatures version Blood Bowl surprisingly well. 

There are six teams to choose from, and they play differently enough to add variety. Elves are fast and control the ball, Orcs hit hard and cheat, and so on.
There might be some balancing issues though. Might…

A team consists of 12 players, represented by a card each. Coaches send their players to Match-ups, representing highlights from matches. The team with the most powerful players wins the match-up. However, players have different skills and abilities that spices things up.

This seems rather straightforward, but choosing what player to use at what moment is surprisingly difficult.

Winning a match-up allows coaches to upgrade their teams with star players and different team abilities. And, obviously, get Fans. The team with the most fans wins the game.

Playtime might be a bit on the long side. Apart from that, I really like Team Manager.

Always wanted to get into Blood Bowl, but never had the means - this makes it possible with a colorful, quick, and riotus take on the original Blood Bowl, but without the miniature painting, collecting, and pitch requirements.  Nice!  Loving that FFG is supporting the game with expansions that both add teams AND new mechanics.  Most recent Foul Play expansion has teams with very diverse mechanics - made our latest game a chaotic slugfest - FUN!

Divide your team to play 3 matches at the same time, no need to touch the ball to win. Passing game excitement? No thanks. Player development or injuries, what for? Hitting a down player is legal but picking up the ball could reveal illegal. Only Dwarfs are worth hitting when downed. Elves regenerate with their shuffling skill. There's no better star player magnet than the cleric Mino. Ogre has frenzy; no, not the Mino, the Ogre. Troll can throw teammates in the next stadium. Whatever team you play, you'll end-up with a 50% generic one anyway.

Another deck-building game in the Blood Bowl universe.  Each player starts off with a race (team) and through the course of the game can hire free agents and special abilities.  Games are played each round and people put players at each game (ala Smash Up or other base games) to win the points/rewards from each game.

The game is actually great fun, but I think it goes on tremendously too long for what it is.  I would love to find a game that does this base beating theme in a way that I can enjoy it.  This one is close, but too long.

RATING: 6
I was really hoping for a fantasy football feel to the game. Maybe a draft early on, a few weeks where you got points for how many receiving yards, tds, and etc that your players got, but this isn't exactly what this one was and so I was somewhat disappointed. I'll play it again, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game requires the right... kind of player.  Mainly, someone with the heart of a 12-year-old boy, willing to throw elbows and play dirty in order for his "fantasy football" team to win the playoffs.  It reminds me of the soccer manager computer games that were popular in the '90s with a better sense of humor.  And yet, it requires more than a bit of forethought regarding how you're going to play your hand, which matches are worth going into, knowing when to count your losses, and above all else understanding your team and what it needs for victory.

I'd be ranking this one an 8 if the full spectrum of Blood Bowl teams was represented.  But they didn't, and since it's Fantasy Flight you can prepare yourself for the inevitable onslaught of overpriced expansion packs...

2017 UPDATE: Well, two inevitable updates later, and yes... it's an 8 now.  IF you buy the expansions.  The 6.75 rating on its own remains.  Also, I didn't realize the soccer sims were still a thing -- Football Manager 14 is my new single-player Through the Ages.

I've played with 2 and 4 and I like it both ways.  With 2 it is more tactical and controlled, with 4 its super chaotic but a blast.  Lots of good trash talking opportunities and clutch dice rolls.  I really enjoy the card interactions of the various players.  So yes, there is luck, and there is screwage, but if you are ok with that there is a great little game under the hood here.  I would really like to see the base game teams have new options to bump them up to the level of the new teams.  If they did print on demand like the did for Space Hulk Death Angel that would be perfectly fine, just hook the old guys up with some new chrome.

RATING: 5.5
It's an area control confrontation game with a bit of deck building that reminded me of the recent [thing=158435]Dog of War[/thing]. Blood Bowl is more random, and much more thematic. They have done a great job recreating the real Blood Bowl game experience, and the components are not lavish, but they are top quality, with great illustrations. My biggest complain in this regard is the difficulty to distinguish the cards of some of the teams.

Besides the strong theme integration, the different teams being quite asymetric is the strongest positive feature.

It is a very random game:
-> The luck of the draw.
-> You compete against several players at the same time, if both of them focus their biggest effort agains you, you will fall behind.
-> The reward cards are quite unbalanced, and so are the Star players.
-> The random cheat tokens.
-> The dice rolls.

It would be a great game for me if it was much shorter, but being on the verge of 2 hours, it's definitly too long for such a random game.

RATING: 9
For BB fans I think the game preserves the flavor of the boardgame and adds an interesting twist and perspective. For non initiates to Blood Bowl its still an nice card game focused on control and with a very wide set of choices and strategies starting with the 6 completly different teams. One sugestion: get a copy of Blood Bowl online at steam and enjoy one of the most funny and yet challenging board games about sports.

So full of humour and great artwork that it's almost expolding, yet gameplay itself isn't always convincing. Also, the game doesn't give me the experience I expected: You don't feel like you're controlling a squad of players, you're not crushing elves with your chaos guys.... The level of abstraction is a bit too high to deliver a convincing imagination of comical brutality in a sports match, and it isn't deep enough for a good tactical game either.

 Like every FFG game, this one has a bit of "too much for its own good", especially with the gameplay options introduced with the expansions.

Pretty fun game, the length felt right to me.  There is a good deal of luck with tackling and cheating tokens, but it stayed fun even dealing with adversity.  The matchups in a 2 player game can be very interesting, knowing the decks will help a little.  The bonus prizes all seem balanced in the sense that team/staff/player upgrades are all good.  We did not realize until the end of the game how many points are available from team and staff upgrades.

RATING: 7.5
Pretty sweet little next-gen deckbuilder. Plays like Knizia's Battle Line on crack: players compete to win matchups by playing their dudes on one side or the other of a card that offers various awards. You always get "something" for playing, and something better for winning. Six races, lots of variation in style between them. You can end up with a big tableau of ongoing bennies/boosts on your side, which I found to be a headache to manage (9 cards at the end of a game where I was playing da Orks). 

I worry there's a bit of swinginess in final scoring, and maybe scoring in general. One player pulled a...can't remember, some kind of team upgrade card...that gave him 7 points on the final turn, thereby granting him a win purely on the luck of the draw. Did not love that.

I'd put this one about on-par with Rune Age, as a really sweet, thinky filler.

Schotten-Totten meets Taj Mahal with slatherings of luck. There's 4 matchup cards to be fought over in the middle (and sometimes a fifth) with a reward just for surviving there and bigger rewards if you have more star power there than the opponent who's committed to the other side of that matchup card. There's the Schotten-Totten. Here though, when you play, you usually get to roll so see if you can injure (lessen the star-power) or kill off an opponent's card. There's some luck. Lots of other cards get a random chit, which could be more star-power or VPs or might kill you off. Which means unless you over-commit, who wins is going to be a lottery. The Taj Mahal aspect is that if two of you go all out over 1 matchup card, the other two players are going to clean up over the other 3 (or 4) matchup cards, so don't start a land war in Asia. Anyway, rewards are VPs or better cards or special power cards. Repeat for 5 rounds, most VPs wins. The game is about to trying to manage the chaos as best you can, making best use of the card effects you have to hand, and accepting the luck if you want to enjoy the game. And hope you don't get sucked into too many Asian land wars. There ain't a lot of finesse involved, with the main decision being what fights you want to pick and how much you listen to the whining whinging about who to pick on and who's winning. It's thematically fun but probably runs too long for what it gives back.

By playing your team members on different match ups you battle to win each game, however winning the game is secondary as the objective is simply to earn fans. You can earn fans by winning games, but also by just participating or perform other team specific actions. The cards represent football players with different stats and abilities. It has some strategy and some luck, with many tokens added and some dice rolling, but the theme fits well as it is a chaotic football game. It is a little longer then it should be but still fun.

Medium weight deck building/base scoring game with a fantasy American football theme (orcs, elves etc.).  Uses a competitive card play mechanic where cards are played at 'matches' with the highest overall score being the winner.  Also has some deck building mechanics where better players and tactics can be added to the basic starting team as a reward for winning matches.

RATING: 6
Yes, this is a deckbuilding game, but the emphasis on deckbuilding is very small--you only add a couple of cards to your deck (and they're random), and you probably won't see them more than twice.  The real action here is the tactical play of cards to various "highlights", where you're competing with a single opponent for numerical supremacy.  The "cheating" tokens added a random element.  This game was definitely more tactical than anything else, and did elicit the head-to-head feel of football.  Point swings due to randomly drawing end-game scoring cards was a bit much.

Update: Alright, well after almost a dozen plays of it, I can honestly say this game is a winner. Each team is unique and the game is even more fun once you start to learn and play your team more often. Add in the expansions and it's freaking brilliant. My only complaints are that 2 and maybe 3 players are not ideal and that the downtime with 4 players becomes a bit long if people are slow. Also...apparently the dice hate me. I seriously couldn't tackle someone if I had 20 dice.



Rather fun game for being so light. It's like a more fleshed out version of Battle Line where the battles happen each time you place down a unit. I can't wait to try out some of the other teams. I think this rating could really only go up from here.

Pleasantly surprised.

My mum always said I would be a managing director when I was younger. Who thought it would be a team of ugly monsters. Shame I'm no longer younger or an adolescent. Maybe then I could relate to and love these ugly monsters. It is not like I went into this game blind. I heard and read the reviews and knew it was based in the Game Workshop universe. Even despite this I still purchased the game. I knew it would be difficult to get to the table because of the design but I wanted to know was this a good game. Yes- I like it, no it won't impress my mum. This is a game where you really got to know the teams to get the most out of it. I didn't and wouldn't so as a game played on occasion it is fine but sadly not designed for me.

Didn't make the cut as I am not it's target market. The game itself is pleasant. I won't play it with you though as you know how to play it and will grind me to the ground, which I understand to be the point of the game.

This game was suggested by friends and I thoroughly enjoy playing it. It is definitely more fun with more players. It is a really good balance between ease of play with some random elements combined with some solid strategy.

It reminds me a lot of Warhammer; in that you can do your best to put your troops/players into the right situations and hope you get average dice rolls. Some games you get some really bad luck, but at that point you can just play a spoiling game and try and take down the leading player or try some wacky strategy to try and fluke a win.

I have overdosed on this game a bit but am always willing to play. I feel the balance is pretty solid. I have both expansions and feel they are definitely worth the purchase.

(5+  plays)  This game nails the source material, as well as the "season" play feel.  The big plays work great, the star players fit in well.  I enjoy the game a lot, and expect to play quite a few times - with people that already like GW Blood Bowl.  You need to like the theme/franchise to like this game, and that's OK considering how well it plays.  However, the game does have a lot of parts to keep track of.  Overall this isn't bad if you're used to more complex games, but the team upgrades do get rather fiddly.  There is lot of tiny cards to pore over repeatedly - and they do a lot of different things and take effect in different circumstances.  It seems like something could have been streamlined with those.

Amazing gaming experience. The production quality and artwork are awesome and the flavour text hilarious. Feels like more of a war game than a sports game, but the theme integrates perfectly. Actually reminded me of Call of Cthulhu the Card Game, only much more engaging. Factions are unique, and there are many pathways to victory. Not a great fan of deck building, but here it works seamlessly, also with a bit of drafting, which I like anyway. 

I also like the game flow:at first there not many options but after 2 rounds your opportunities grow exponentially, and so does your strategy, as priorities change.

I would love to get expansions.

Somewhat put off by the bloody-future-sport theme, I never really bothered looking into this: now - with FFG and Games Workshop all split up - I wish I had, as it'd most likely be an overly expensive purchase; which is a shame, because I could see this working really well with a couple of colleagues. I played a three player game which - once the 'obvious' moves of ensuring the best return from the highlights games were done with - became more tactical with each card played. Reminded me of Baseball Highlights 2045 (a good thing!); my only worry would be that the card plays were a little 'obvious'. Bloody good fun.

Very good, for sure better than I was expecting. The game recreates a mini-league for Blood Bowl; the game is a bit cold but some efforts has been made to include a lot of the flavor of the original game, I really appreciated that: flavor is a big component in Games Workshop games.
The box is a little richer than the last FFG games and six teams are enough to add variety and replayability to the game.
I think Blood Ball fans will enjoy this a lot. And also the others! :)

All Fantasy Flight games seem to be the same.

This game feels more like a generic skirmish war game than playing football matches. You don't actually score goals in this game. You score VP in the form of fan points, which are earned when you win a battle.

First impressions after one game are always questionable, but I really liked this.  Lots of fun and lots of Blood Bowl atmosphere.  It takes a little too long (our game was almost 3 hours with 4 new players), but at no point did it drag (and some of us are faster players than others, so games regularly run a bit long).

RATING: 8
My go-to game for a quick session of something tactical, yet, easy to learn/play.

Functions play differently enough to provide enough replayability. The game definitely has its fun, but also, challenging moments.

In a way, you can (or at least I) consider this as a less variety, but slightly more complex (with an element of luck) Smash-Up or a dummed-down Warhammer 40K: Conquest with 2-4 players as a bonus. They all share the basic core mechanic: Various, different functions play area control over some "bases".

Works best with four.

This is what Caesar & Cleopatra should have been all those years ago. Match up those cards, but throw in some dice and card powers to add variety. Works really well, with seasons often coming down to the special scoring at the end. Works particularly well multi-player, and with 1 v 1 there's no whinging about picking on the leader. Theme works better than I expected. In the end, very happy the deck building was thrown away and it was redesigned.

What a refreshing take on the deck building genre (sorry, I was a little tired of Dominion and its many clones).

Like others already said, the game is not simply the card version of the miniatures' one. Yet, it brings several traits from Blood Bowl to the table in a way that it feels complete. Also, it's a shinning example of how to make a deck-building game that never feels like multi-player solitaire. A must for those that would like to play a full season of the Blood Bowl miniatures' game, but don't have the time, nor enough commited gaming buddies to make it happen.

tons of hype for this game that is difficult to live up to but I enjoyed the game.  However,this is a game that shouldn't be taken too seriously because there is a bit of luck with die roll and cheat tokens however, this can also present a press your luck situation which is interesting in itself.  Tough to rate after one play because there are so many races and cards.  It is a deck building game with variable powers.  It will take quite a few plays to really get this game as there is quite a bit of text which can bog the game down.  AP also plays a factor as there   are only 4 or 5 rounds in the game.  Still feeling this one out though.   Good game that has potential to rise quite a bit in my ratings

As a long time Blood Bowl player, I was quite pleased to get to pick this up very cheaply 2nd hand at a convention. Finally got to give it a try at the weekend at Gaelcon

The game is relatively simple to understand, but definitely helps when you have someone to explain it. With up to 5 matches to fight over, which game you choose to participate in can be a big decision. Do you join in for the one with bigger prizes, or go for the lower prize that others will not likely compete against you for?

The game gets pretty chaotic and all the different races seemed pretty balanced to me. I thought it was a pretty fun game and glad I was able to pick it up at a very nice price!

At first glance this is a game where you try to get a majority by laying down cards at up to 4 locations. Nothing new, I first thought. But then there are a lot of ways/mechanics how to change these majorities. I like that these mechanics suit well to Blood Sport, this way the game is not an abstract game but offers a lot of atmosphere. However I also think that the main idea of the game (get majority for a card) is very simple whereas the game is very complex with all those player and improvement cards - it's difficult to keep an overview. I feel that I have not much control when I play this game.

This game should not work or be fun.

It has lots of ridiculous tacked on theme that emerged quite well with the straight-forward and somewhat subtle area control maneuvering.  It has lots of explicit randomness that averages out reasonably well and allows for plenty of mitigation and reactions.  It has lots of leader bashing politics, mitigated with enough tactical efficiency variation to make for interesting choices and informed alliances.  The asymmetric factions have rock-paper-scissors relations that may only be balanced in multi-player matches, but which are close enough to still create tensions in an individual match.

With 2, a little luck can cause an early lead that ruins the run.  But it's still solid and pretty quick.
With 4+, the politics can overwhelm the game and suck up huge amounts of time, making the game overstay its welcome (but not be wholly unsatisfying).
With 3, it's great.  Play with exactly 3.

26-01-2015. Rated after 1 play. Blood Bowl you play a Blood Bowl team trying to score highlights. These highlights are cards that show a certain match highlight that you try to meet. Which is thematically weird. 

Basically, you try to score areas by playing players with high strength. You can tackle opposing players to reduce their combat strength. Each highlight also has a ball, that is the tie-breaker.

Fun game, but it is a little long for what it is and thematically not so strong.

Even when it shares some elements with the genre, this card game is not exactly a deckbuilding one, at least not in the most common sense. Nevertheless, this is without a doubt one of the best FFG games of the last years. Players are team managers that try to win the public affection during a blood football season, mostly winning games and tournaments week after week, but also making great plays and moves. All of that with card combinations and effects. Tension, lots of fun, some strategy and a great dose of luck makes this a great choice.

BB:TM is a fun card game, but it is pretty important to win highlights and/or tournaments, so if you can play your opponent's off against each other, you'll have a significant advantage. 

The change to remove certain staff upgrades is a good one, as those cards are so powerful that I considered digging for as many upgrades as possible to be the optimal way to play. With the change, more strategies seem viable. 

There is a light deck building aspect, but you won't be changing the composition of your deck drastically. The different decks feel different, even though they share cards.

I expected deckbuilding gimmick du jour, but this was more like Chaos in the Old World: The Card Game. Asymmetric cards, upgrades, play your cards ('figures') into one of the highlights ('regions'), count majorities. Deck management is minimal, amounting to the incremental "place on top of draw deck' and 'only go through your deck ~5 times' seen in Mage Knight Board Game.

Spoiler alert: I've never encountered a '____: The Card Game" or "____ Express" that worked. Once you've tried the good stuff, you can't go back, even if playtime is halved.

Sports games now seem to go in 2 directions: actual simulation of the ball game using a ball marker and dice; or 'bracketology' games that cater to the fantasy side. BB:TM goes for the latter, in the vein of [thing=23604][/thing]. Having the ability to play anywhere (not even on your side) and managing multiple teams in the latter was more interesting though. In BB:TM, you contest a maximum of 2 highlights each round, plus the tournament if any (very rare to be able to jump into a 3rd highlight), and any time you win more than 1 highlight is a gift.

Fun as a quick filler and this rating might grow. Some areas of improvement:

The team upgrades don't seem to provide enough replayability, since you can end up decking it out. I'd rather it be CitOW-style choose-your-upgrade (for decision complexity), or have so many random team upgrades that it takes many plays to get through all the combinations (for card/rule complexity). This is probably the smallest quibble (just nitpicking here).

Drafting generic star players from the OWA and CWA decks isn't very exciting. These need to BREAK the game. And my opponents. Give me a MONSTER player deck here.

The players need to be more alive. Most just have "when enter play" abilities, and the rest have defensive abilities. More ways to manipulate and use the already-there players, including the downed ones, and move cheating tokens around would make it more dynamic. Maybe it's coming with an expansion (seemed like it with some cards referencing redundant situations), or it's in the Human, Wood Elf or Orc decks, which I haven't seen.

Lastly, this game needs to replace 'tackle' with JUMP/MUG, 'down' with INJURE/MAIM and 'injure' with KILL/CURB STOMP/POWER KICK IN THE NUTS/SKULL-CRUSHING FINALE. Why so PC?

This has tenaciously kept its spot as my favorite game for over a year now. Chaos in the Old World keeps trying to butt in but every time it does, Team Manager shines just a little bit brighter. Fantastic design. Great theme. Strategic with a thematic amount of chaos (pun intended). Not altogether balanced but 4+ players really helps balance that out. Excellent game.

Bought this on a recent trip to London. Played it in the hotel later that day. Easy to pick up, game mechanics are straightforward. The star players, and team/staff upgrades keep things ticking along. Only negative is that some scenarios are not covered in enough detail so we've had to make up some house rules.

Juego de cartas, muy al estilo del BattleLine, pero basado en el universo Blood Bowl y con mucha más chicha (y caos).
Cada jugador tiene su equipo y a lo largo de varios partidos, irá consiguiendo más hinchas y mejorando su equipo. Al final gana el jugador que tenga mas hinchas. Se ha convertido en poco tiempo en uno de mis favoritos.

Card. Nice card game of competing in Blood Bowl matches. It does have a deck-building component, but it is a relatively small part of the game; in fact, you don't really purchase cards for your deck per se, it's more like one of several rewards you can receive for competing and/or winning match highlights.

Great interaction, replayability from the highlights and events, good theme integration. Solid game; bought at BGGcon and we all enjoyed it.

Traded. Nobody requested it after we got home, so out it went in the great purge of '12.

Amerikai foci kicsit brutálisan. A játékosok csapatok vezetői, akik hetente különböző meccseken vehetnek részt ezzel a rajongóik számát növelve, ami a játék célja. Ezen kívül egy-egy meccs sztárjátékosok felvételét, különböző csapatsegítő emberek, illetve saját fejlesztések elérését teszik lehetővé. Tehát van a játéknak egy pakliépítős része, hogy minél jobb játékosokból álljon a csapatunk, de itt is azt tudom mondani, hogy még pont követhető ez a paklifejlődés, mint a Mage Knightban és nem csak erről szól a játék. Van egy kombózási része is, a különböző segítők és saját fejlesztéslapjaink jó megválasztása tekintetében. Illetve van egy lapmenedzselő része is, hogy a körünkben felhasználható 6 lapunkat hogyan osszuk el az egyes meccsekhez. Jól kitalált a labda szerepe a játékban, jók az egyes játékosok képességei és érdekes módon elég jól megoldott a 3 és 4 játékos mód is, bár természetesen ez alapvetően egy 2 személyes játék. Összességében azt tudom mondani, nagyon kellemes meglepetés volt a Vérfoci. Nem túl bonyolult, mégis bőven van döntési helyzet a játékban. Negatívumként a lapok erősségének nem teljes kiegyenlítettségét tudom felhozni, illetve az egyes csapatokat sem éreztem igazán kiegyenlítettnek, de kétszemélyes játékban talán jobb ez is. Kicsit talán sok a lap, a saját fejlesztések mondjuk nem kellenének bele és jobban követhető lenne a végjáték is, illetve rajongókat sem adnék csak mondjuk meccsekkel, hogy ne legyen túl nagy szórás a végpontokban. Szóval, aki szereti a lapmendzselős játékokat és a komoly konfrontációt annak bátran ajánlom kipróbálásra.

If you're a Blood Bowl fan and don't mind the fact that this game is all down to the random card draws then it could be the game for you and your Blood Bowl loving friends to sit down and have some fun with. However, if you like thing a little bit more cerebral, and want a game that is down to skill then look elsewhere. I've enjoyed playing the game and I think it's a worthy addition to my collection. but I'm not going to kid myself into thinking its some great strategic endeavour.

[i]Funny and Exciting Game Full of Drama. The Only Downside is the Abilities (they Get Fiddly) and Can Run Long![/i]

This is a pretty exciting game. It's always been fun every time I've played it! Cheating, tackling, it's all a lot of fun that can't really be had anywhere else short of the real Blood Bowl game.

Each team seems to have a flavor. Something I always dig. But unfortunately I think the players could stand to be more differentiated. Many of them share abilities across teams, and having every faction start with several identical throwaway linebackers is just boring. Please don't put such intentionally crappy cards in the game, and especially not in such numbers and across teams -- makes the Freebooter ability basically "get rid of a linebacker", and makes card-drawing better in comparison to the other abilities I think

I wish this game had just a little more strategy and depth. For first half of the game I'm usually having too much fun to notice, but this one can go up to 90-120 minutes with 4 players.

4 player is particularly offensive, because the level of fiddliness and bookkeeping surpasses the similar-but-way-deeper Chaos in the Old World. Keeping track of all the rewards during scoreboard phase can be a little tedious

There is errata in the FAQ that suggests just getting rid of certain Staff Upgrade cards. This seems necessary, but doesn't indicate that the game was tested very deeply because it seems to be quite an obvious problem with many groups finding it very early into the game's life cycle

The Sudden Death expansion is golden. Every element of the expansion, from contract payouts to new teams to ESPECIALLY the enchanted balls, gives the game more variability and flavor, more tactical depth, and more excitement (there's more fighting over the ball on the field and more for "already live" players to do because of enchanted balls and downed abilities, and because of contract payouts you don't know how many fans you even really have until the end).

[b]I'd Rather Play:[/b] Chaos in the Old World (At 4+ players)

A fun back-and-forth card game with just a hint of deck building.  Looks to be a fair amount of replayability with 6 different teams to choose from and different tournaments, headlines and highlights showing up each time.  It only allows up to 4 players, but I hope that will be remedied with the inevitable expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A funner thinkier take-that version of Battleline, with enough randomness to strip out the dry abstract quality of it.  I love the special powers, and playing for combos is quite fun.  Timing is a big issue in this, and knowing when to commit is as important as where.  Lots of tough little decisions, but not overwhelmingly so.  Losses aren't as hard felt as many of these kinds of games, as consolation prizes will keep you in the running. I had a blast with this, can't wait to explore all the teams.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fans of the original might feel this game lacks the tactical aspect that makes Blood Bowl so much fun, but this game trades that for accessibility, game length and multiplayer.

A conicse rulebook includes very few rules and simple mechanics but manages to maintain the character of the game and the teams in it.  

I'd love to see an expansion with more teams, but wonder if they'd just be redundant within the simplistic mechanics of this version.

*Added 1 month later* As I play it more some of the shine has come off of it, the dirty player mechanic for instance is bugging me more and more.  There really is no tactical element and I find that just makes me wish to play the original. I would really like to see expansions for some of the other teams.

Downgraded from 8 to 6.

A few things about this one that I found interesting.  First, I don't care for football very much, but the appeal of this game is not necessarily to football fans.  In fact, there's not much resembling actually playing a football game.  You play to situations and you try to gain the most fans, not score the most points.  And you do that with a deck of cards for each team that feel very different between them, and each have different strategies.  The concept, to me, is out of the park good.  We've played it three times so far, and each time has been enjoyable.  Quick setup time and a good deal of fun in less than an hour.  Looking forward to playing multiplayer.

I realize that the game arcs require that you need to have the duration that it has in order to get some of the strategic interest, but it's really way too long for a bit of a back-and-forth take-that kind of game. The theme is kind of neat, but that's about the only redeeming quality.

I played this for the first time instead of watching the Super Bowl. In my initial play, my team was some species of elf, and I won on a tiebreaker. There was lots of text and fiddly pieces, as you might expect of an Ameritrashy FFG game, but it was quite fun and pretty interesting as a 3p game. It's nicely asymmetric and reminds me a bit of Battle Line. It went long, but I was learning the game, and I enjoyed it throughout. 

I've since played again but with 4p and too much AP. Those factors increased the playing time beyond my taste for a game of this weight. But with fewer players, played quickly, I'd happily play again.

This game feels very much like Smash Up but deeper, more fun, and even takes less time to play.  So all-in-all, better in every way.

In this game each player represents a team manager in the world of Blood Bowl trying to accumulate the most fans.  This is done across 5 rounds where each round a certain number of headlines/tournaments is placed out on the board.  Players play their Blood Bowl player cards on these headlines/tournaments in an attempt to accumulate the most star power and get the rewards for that card.  The depth of the game comes from the abilities on all the different players and upgrades you can get and how best to use them and in what order.  And there is a lot of depth and strategy to this reasonably simple game.

Plus the whole game, even with new players and teaching it to them first, can finish in under an hour.  Even quicker with experienced players.

I've heard complaints about the 2-player variant of this game and honestly I don't think it plays that different at all.  There's less competition and I prefer it with 3 or 4 but it works well for players that mostly play duo also.

Hugely entertaining, slightly random, some skill, some bluffing, quite tough to know which battles to fight. It should feel over long and too random - but the game is much fun it flies by and the outrageous fortune of the dice and cheating tokens are part of the joy of the game. 

After having experienced one game that lasted 3 and a half hours my advice to new gamers is not to over anlayse, just play your cards and let the dice roll.

Blood Bowl is awesome. One of the best 2 player miniature games of all time.  It is with a great amount of nostalgia that I play this new Blood Bowl Team Manager card game.    I have played a couple times and I like the flow of the game.  I am pretty sure there is only one way to victory though which reduces strategic options.  But the card play is still engaging and interesting.  I have yet to get over how awesome it is to play with the great star players of BB fame.  Drawing and playing The Mighty Zug, or Varag Ghoul Chewer still brings a smile to my face as I remember fondly crushing skulls with those guys a decade ago.    I have yet to fully make a decision on whether this is a good game or not.  It is like if you went on a date with Megan Fox and later someone asked you to comment on her dress. After basking in her radiant beauty for an evening, I am not sure whether I would have even noticed the dress.

RATING: 8
A great microcosm of a Blood Bowl season in card game form that takes a fraction of the time to play.  Just like real Blood Bowl, the teams are horribly unbalanced and some will always win when pitted against others; that's where playing with 3-4 players to help mitigate this comes in.  An excellent game as long as at least 3 are playing.  With two, you have to ensure that either two bashy or two fast teams play; otherwise, the speedy team will always win.  Not very fun for the bashy player, but at least this is true to the original Blood Bowl.

The theme is a little whack; there seems to be a real disconnect between committing players to "highlights" and "tournaments" and the actual game of Blood Bowl.  How can a simple lineman win an entire game just by being present?  Granted, I understand that the game was probably purposely simplified to keep the complexity low, but it doesn't feel all that thematic because of it.  As long as you can get past this and see it more as a hand management exercise, it becomes a fun game.

Like Death Angel, surprisingly effective at creating atmosphere -- the matches, Schotten Totten-like card clashes with ball tokens that bounce between the two sides, do create the same excitement as a rowdy sporting event, with the tackle dice and cheating tokens generating equal cheers and groans.

My problems with the game are twofold and related. Luck has far too much influence, to the point where no outcome feels like the result of any skill or good play: if it's not a failed tackle, it's a referee's whistle for cheating or lucky draw from one of the grossly imbalanced card decks.

The fun atmosphere would be compensation enough if not for the fact that it goes far, far, far too long for a game with this level of randomness. Teaching games routinely go for two hours! With experienced, faster players and one of the short-game variants, I can see enjoying the game as a filler, but it's not worth that level of time commitment.

Love the basic game mechanisms, but it seems like the game's balance is way off. There are a few star players and abilities that just put others to shame. Especially so with some of the end game scoring cards that can net you a TON of points.

There's a lot of randomness. Dice rolls, cheating tokens, hard draws, card draws, and so on. Overall it just feels a bit too chaotic and luck based for the game length. Wish it was better balanced and had a touch less luck. If you get a bad hand in one of the later matches it can kill your game. Similarly, if another player gets a lucky draw of end game score cards that work together he can amass a huge number of points without actually winning matches. Just seems weird that someone who doesn't win matches or participate in many of them can win the game due to a few synergistic point scoring card combos.

This is multi-player Battle Line but with more information going on.  It does a superb job of capturing the feel of Blood Bowl in a shorter, less fiddly package.  The rules are actually surprisingly easy and the game flows nicely.  I'd say it's a bit long for what it is.

I feel like 4 is best, followed by 3 and then 2.  I'm not sure I'd bother with just 2, but I'm sure it would work well enough.

Very fun light beer and pretzels kind of game. The dice are not your friends in this one, but all the upgrades and different teams definitely are. A little long for what it is, but normally enjoyable until the end, even if you're losing. The theme does a lot for me.

Different take on the blood bowl concept but still gives the great Blood Bowl feel a rather fast cardgame with a decent amount of depth. Expansions adds a lot to the game in terms of replayabilty but dont think that the expansion teams are really balanced enough vs each other (so watch out for that).

Art/components 4/5

I often hear people say that this game is better than they expected.  I'm inclined to agree.  I didn't expect to enjoy this game as much as I did when I first heard of it.  I think it is that the game doesn't play like (North American) football, but the theme makes it feel a lot like football.

Each player is a manager/coach of a team.  Your team consists of your starting deck of players.  When you play cards, you are actually assigning your players to compete for a highlight or tournament.  The player card may also have abilities that help you win the highlight.  Highlights can only have two players competing for them which means that the third or fourth player (if any) cannot participate in that highlight.  There are enough highlights in each round to choose from, so you should be able to compete in at least one.  There may be a tournament in a round as well and any number of teams can participate for the prizes of that tournament.

The goal is to have the most fans at the end of the game.  Winning and participating in some highlights and tournaments will win fans.  There are also other abilities and situations where you can also win fans.  Highlights and tournaments also have other prizes for winners and participants in terms of better team abilities or adding better players to your team.

This game feels like you are managing and coaching a football team.  Each game represents a football season and each round represents a week in the football season.  There are 5 rounds in total before the game ends and everyone tallies the fans they have acquired throughout the season to determine the winner.

The game can drag on.  There is quite a bit of thought going towards playing a card on your turn and you only play one card per turn.  I do like the fact that there is so much thought in each play.  A game with 3 players can last over 3 hours and longer with 4 players.

RATING: 8.5
Really good cardgame. Has similarities with Battle Line and Field of Glory (you are fighting for certain locations called 'pitches). 

Best thing though is that it captures the atmosphere of the Blood Bowl universe really well, and introduces some very fun chaos and campaign-like effects.

Quite impressed that it managed to capture the Blood Bowl spirit so well, differing so much from the 'real' Blood Bowl as actual game.

Will play this more often!

[UPDATEjan 2014] Played this again with friends, we had a great time, enjoyed by all. Recommended for anyone interested in light-hearted fun. It is a tactical game, not much strategy, and turns flow fast so it keeps you going. With three it plays as good as with two (maybe even better). Great game all around.

Fantastic deck building game. You play as the manager of a fantasy sports league. The rules are extremely simple--just throw your guys on one side of a match, and the player with the highest numbers win. But there are a ton of ways to mess with other players, get extra points, and cheat, which keeps this from being a predictable game.

Best played with people who won't care if their seemingly guaranteed win was just lost because of a dice roll or a randomly selected tile. The randomness never feels too harsh or unfair, though.

I love this game. It's simple but fun, the flavor is very funny and well rendered, and although I'm not much of a fan of randomness, in this game it doesn't determine too much whether your win or lose, as long as you factor it carefully. Strategy plays the bigger role, and I just love cycling through teams and try them all!
Great game. All the fun the original miniature game failed to deliver due to ridiculously cumbersome and boring rules. And also much cheaper.

And I have to add...

I love it! This card game bring you the feeling of the competition for the classic boardgame, but in a totaly different way. The trasposition of the background is perfect. The random result is still present but not only in dice rolls. If you hate luck based games forget it, but don't miss this gem if you like Blood Bowl. It could be a great surprise!

After playing it with good house rules this game shines!
- Before starting the round each player should select his action in turn order until all action (not tournament) are selected by two different teams.
- Select secretly player card to be placed in one action at the same time, but deploy them in turn order (reduce the table position effect).
- Remove high score cards which changes drastictly the final score.

Although a wacky multiplayer variant of Battle Line, I must say I enjoyed myself a great deal despite the random elements and fiddly bits.

I am concerned that the staff cards and the downtime will get out of hand if you play with more than three players however so that nudge the rating down a tad.

The randomness of hiring Freebooters and Stars almost breaks this game (and can break some individual plays) but there is enough going on in other aspects to help it retain most of the fun of Blood Bowl, with less tactics and less strategy.

It really doesn't need to be a Blood Bowl game, as it has almost nothing in common outside of theme.

I think I'd always rather play regular Blood Bowl, but this is a decent alternative for 4 people or those who have less than 2 hours.

Update: the more I play this the more apparent it becomes how massively luck heavy this is. A few dice rolls go in your favour at the start of the game and you might get to recruit 3 star players. If your opponent has none, you're then at a massive advantage in round 2. Do well in round 2... snowball effect. Conversely, if you get a couple of useless Freebooters over a Star Player, you're screwed. Some of the power-ups are just better than others. All in all, this is a nice idea, done badly with my pet hate of tiny cards that people need to be aware of across a table.

Rating down from 6.8 to 5.5.

Tentative rating, based on a partial play. I'm guessing it may go up with a full playthrough of the game.

They seem to have captured the right feel for the world in question, which is great. There's still some luck involved, but nowhere near as much as a game of actual Blood Bowl. That's a good thing, IMO.  The original BB game could be very frustrating sometimes.

Update after a couple more plays:  I like it quite a bit.  It's light, with a little bit of luck, but it doesn't have that same luck-streak problem you get in the original game.

Very strong theme, although I don`t feel i`m a football manager, I fight for majorities. 

I have no problems with the randomness of the dice when you atack, but it`s strange yhan even you can`t see you own cheat markers (your players often get this markers and theit could help you by getting more strenght for mayoriyu, but also kick your player out from the fight for majority). 

The teams are different, but it seems doen`t change so much. You will do the same things, but one team will by setting a player on on event atack, the other will get the ball. But you`re still will setting players on events. I don`t feel such variety like for example in Neuroshima Hex.

Please draw a card. Your card directs you to flip this coin. The coin indicates you roll a die against Matrix B. You rolled a 5! Option 5 says pick a random player.

I considered buying the expansion to thicken this up, but the expansion mostly broadens the unpredictability. Why would I want that?

I may decide against selling Team Manager, just because it's a good beer-and-pretzels game.

The game is a lot of fun to play!  The Cheat Token aspect does lead a nice bit of randomness.  And I like that the Star Player deck is chosen from all the teams that make up each of the two factions.  Nice to combine races and abilities in a single team.

Theme is excellent, and does a good job of fitting into the Blood Bowl universe.

Components are well made.  Not sure why it was limited to a 4-player game, when there are 6 races included, other than to make for an expansion.  I'm sure there will be many race expansions, since the main Blood Bowl game contains over 20 races in its current rules.

For an update: This is a great game, especially with the right group.  This game is more of a Beer-n-Pretzel game than a deep-strategy think-fest, so plan accordingly with your gaming group.

Wow what a cracking game. It's deceptive because FFG normally box things dependant on their pro-rata to game length (just a personal view of course!).
So this is unexpectedly meatier than you would imagine - and all the better for that.
It's a very clever port allowing a very good tactical game, whilst still very much maintaining the flavour of Blood Bowl.
I understand that it was delayed as they scrapped the original idea of yet another deck-builder - and I for one am very pleased that they did.
This is original, thematic, and most improtantly a whole load of fun to play.

RATING: 9
I like it. The somewhat-high luck factor, between the dice and the random cheat tokens, really fits well with the theme in this case. This game has a really interesting take on deckbuilding, much like Core Worlds, in that you'll likely only go through your deck a couple of times per game.

Update: Have played this quite a bit now and I still love it. To appreciate this game you have to accept that it is about trying to get the most points while managing the chaos, not about carrying out some long-term strategy. Because of the cheat tokens you can never be sure of a win, so you have to try to spread out in hopes of winning at least something.

I may raise my rating to a 9 over time if I find myself still enjoying this game as much as I do now. I bought this based on a review because I loved the way the theme was handled through the mechanics. I did not regret it. The base teams have different abilities and this creates some imbalance which can lead to a frustrating experience if you get stuck with the wrong team. That said, the theme is VERY well done, there are plenty of options for alternate strategies and the interaction is more jovial than cut-throat (though it is possible for players to team up on a front runner as I discovered in my last play).

First Impression:

A well produced game with a crazy theme: warhammer 40K rugby!

First of all, theme and humour oozes from this game, from it's artwork, text, abilities, categories... pretty much everything. This is a classy thematic game and should be well respected for that. The core mechanism is also pretty solid. Multiple rugby "games" (area control) with variable rewards combined with deck handling/building give players a plethora of choices during the game that really matter. Few thematic games can claim that skill is rewarded more than in this game. The game also excells in the typical fields of thematic games. It's highly replayable, with several teams that feel differently and an impossible amount of extra coaches, transactions and team skills that will make even the same team never play the same twice. It's also quite fun, with just the right amount of tactical take that (and no kingmaking!), luck and agony (cheating!). Finally it flows really well, as the players really have little to calculate and more to commit to, trying to ride the odds and read their opponents.

So what's not to like? Well, I for one can't really say I love rugby. But then, if I ever liked it, it would be in 40K format_. Other than that, as with all thematic games, the real question is whether the theme inspires you, or not. I could say that luck can ruin or fix a team, but that's a moot point in a game that is suppossed to have a great deal of risk in it.

I must admit I really liked this one. Preplaying it, the theme really killed it for me. Now, I'd really love to play rugby (in a boardgame) again!

This has to be one of the most fun games around.  It truly captures the feel of blood bowl, and the hilarity of the universe.  Great game mechanics lend to a lot of fun as well.  It's an ebb and flow game with each player taking turns committing players to a pitch, but the effects of their abilities really make you strateize on when and how you'l play each of your players.

We found that even starting players had impacts on the game later on, which made us find value in almost every player.  Also, with 6 teams now, and potentially more in expansions, the replayability in the box alone keeps us coming back. 

We played 3 games the night we got it and each team has a definitive feel to it which was every fun as well.

Well designed, easy rules, and something you need no prior experience with the Blood Bowl universe even to truly enjoy... although knowing Morg will undoubtedly help you enjoy it even more :)

As mentioned elsewhere, this is not really a deckbuilding game (which is totally fine)-  it's really more of an extended-trick-taking game, like Blue Moon or (more closely) Battle line.  

Unfortunately, it's an extended trick taking game with randomness from the card draws, AND randomness from dice, AND randomness from cheating counters, AND some random events.  I do enjoy Blood Bowl... I didn't care much for this.  I felt like my decisions were too frequently overridden by luck for them to be meaningful.  

In fact, I'd ascribe distinctly more luck to this game than I would to Blood Bowl-  in Blood Bowl, you're taking a lot of actions that either don't involve dice, or are very safely taken with dice due to skill levels/abilities/rerolls.  Then you take a few actions each turn that are riskier propositions.  In this game, there's random at the beginning (your hand, random event), random during (the dice rolls for certain actions, comparable to blood bowl), then random after (cheating).

I do recognize that if you have a bad starting hand one round, that means your hand will be much better the next round.  However,  this still compounds the problem of the other randomness-  When you've got a hand full of mostly linemen, there's very little you can do to increase your lot in life that turn.  So you're hoping the random elements don't junk out your actually "functional" turns. So, generally speaking, you're hoping your functional turns occur when someone else is having a functional turn too-  so that maybe you have the opportunity to outplay them.  and then you're hoping the dice and cheating doesn't negate your good plays.  and hoping the random event isn't bad for your team's strengths.  There's a lot of hoping going on,  just to get to the point where what you do matters.

This doesn't appeal to me, but some people like heavily overpowering randomness, and it's Blood Bowl, so it'll sell.

Oh wait, there's movement!  I think it's still alive!  After all these years it's miraculously showing signs of life. Maybe it's just been in a coma all this time?

Nope, it's just decomposition gasses escaping the remains.

Ok, so that might be a bit harsh.  I guess this is a good game, but it just didn't do it for me.  Don't go into this expecting anything like the Blood Bowl experience of old, it's BB in name only.

This game is better than I even hoped it would be when it was first announced.  The teams play very differently. So, there is a lot of replay value in the box.  The cheat tokens add enough uncertainty to make each matchup exciting, but not so much to make things completely random.  The art is great.  The rule book was clear.  My rating may go up (from a 9).

At first, I thought this would be an only ok game. I bought it because I like the BloodBowl franchise (have it on the computer, unfortunately not as board game). After a few plays, my expectations were way surpassed. :) The matches are very interesting and the choices you made on the field have a real impact in the development of your team and on your path to victory (or total obliteration). And, above all of this, it is so much fun!

Oh yeah, it's pretty good. I have a weakness for football sims of all stripes, which means that a game like this automatically gets me jazzed. This is a good treatment of the Blood Bowl franchise and is effective at reaching players beyond its natural GW fanbase. I'm definitely intrigued to see what FFG has in store as expansions. More teams will go well with the six already included in the game box.

One three player game behind. Ok game if you are familiar with the world and can handle lots of cards with texts. Ameritrash game in the world of Warhammer.

Quite nicely handles the matches without going too much in to the details or not lasting for too long.

A tense, if swingy, card commitment game. The theme is fun (my wife said "ugh" to the title and then got into the tongue-in-cheek theme during the first game) and fits the gameplay well.

There are always important (although sometimes obvious) choices to be made. Those who are luck-averse beware. Between card draws and the dice the unexpected often happens. For me those surprises are more fun than irritating but your mileage may vary.

This is a game that is FUN, and I like that.

RATING: N/A
Blood Bowl: Team Manager is a bone-breaking, breathtaking standalone card game of violence and outright cheating for two to four players. Chaos, Dwarf, Wood Elf, Human, Orc, and Skaven teams compete against each other over the course of a brutal season. Customize your team by drafting Star Players, hiring staff, upgrading facilities, and cheating like mad. Lead your gang of misfits and miscreants to glory over your rivals all to become Spike! Magazine's Manager of the Year!
\13\\13\
Once a manager has chosen one of the six teams, he has five weeks to groom them into the best in the league, culminating with the Blood Bowl tournament. He does this by competing at highlights, collecting payouts, upgrading his personnel, and drafting Star Players.
\13\\13\
Managers begin the season with a starting team deck full of basic scrub players. These players are none too bright and have limited talents, but a clever manager can play to their strengths by carefully positioning them to excel on the pitch.
\13\\13\
Is your team ready to compete against other teams in head-to-head highlights? Highlights are the randomly determined matchups over which players compete. The more highlights a team wins, the more it improves and the more fans it accumulates.
\13\\13\
The season culminates with the Blood Bowl tournament. After the Blood Bowl, the season ends. Players then tally up their total fans and the manager with the most fans wins the game.

RATING: 8
This game does an admirable job of capturing the flavor of Blood Bowl, despite being a fairly simple card game. There are only a few icons on the cards, but the special abilities and team upgrades work well to differentiate the races from each other. Just like in the board game, it's hard to keep the elves off the ball and the chaos team can't even get through the coin toss without fouling themselves right off the pitch. It takes a game or two to understand what upgrades and Star Players to pursue for each team, but once you get a handle on it the strategies for handling opposing teams really open up. It might get a little bit repetitive if over-played, (again, it's fairly simple) but as a quick dose of everything I love about Blood Bowl, the fun factor is spot on. I just hope they eventually give me some more races to play with!

RATING: 8
chaotic (I like to play chaos ifn given the choice though generally we have random teams) game of team manageing in the warhammer worlds blood bowl leagues. each turn representing a weeks worth of games in which you can struggle to play in as many games as possible to win fan approval for the end game victor.

Each team plays quite distinctly  and I find my tactics can often change on the fly as I pick up tactics cards (a favoured tactic of mine involves the aquisition of named starplayers though another card can mean I go for freebooters) 

It is hard to find anotehr game to comapre it to, 
Though in some ways it feels rather like a multiplayer game of dragon dice, in that you are constantly striveing to use limited resources to occupy and win as much territory as possible.

should you like teh game in miniature or on the comnputer you will probably enjoy this

You don't do much deckbuilding here, so i'd rather just not have that mechanism at all. The bases and minions thing works a bit like Smash Up, except with not nearly that interesting combos and that much variety, and all your choices are just obvious, and you keep the strongest card for last etc. Boring.

a little bit of deckbuilding in this fun little card game!  choose which battle (game) to fight for and manage your cards to win.  There are many battles to choose from each round, each with benefits of wining...so you must choose which ones you want, and how many forces to put there.  Spread yourself too thin and you won't win any.  Gang up on one and you will get it, but the others will win multiple battles and you'll be left behind with your "one win".  fun game!  A bit of strategy with some luck of the draw... makes for a good game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
What's not to love about a fantasy sport centered around pummeling your opponent into the dirt? Oh yeah, and maybe you'll pick up the ball once in while, too. Who knows?

I might get some ugly looks for saying this but, you know that game Smash Up? Well, if you like that game, I think you really out to be playing this instead. And what if you didn't like Smash Up? Give this one a try before you write it off. It's got a lot more going on than you might think.

And what is that, exactly? Well, for starters, there's a tiny bit of deck-building here. See, each game starts you off with a basic team. You've got linemen, throwers, tacklers, etc. But as you proceed through different match ups, you can recruit new, unique players to your team. Trolls and ogres and giant, spiky, rolling death-machines. You might also recruit assistant coaches that sit on the sidelines and give you bonuses, or even special upgrades unique to your chosen team.

Somewhat like Smash Up, BB:TM is a kind of area-control game, where players duke it out to win rewards for their ranking. Each of your players has their own skills and special abilities. These might help you take possession of the ball, knock over your opponents players or even cheat when the refs aren't looking!

Each "area" (which represents a highlight from a particular game) has different payouts depending on who wins and which side of the match-up they're on. This is where you get that fun stuff like new players, coaches and power-ups. But don't get too carried away hording your upgrades, because that's not how you win the game. Only the team with the most "fans" (the game's victory points) at the end is the winner. How do you get fans? Often by winning match-ups...but there are some other ways a sneaky team can expand their followers.

This is a delightfully unique sort of game that doesn't take itself seriously at all and get is just serious enough to put you into the spirit of head-knocking competition. It's tricky to explain exactly what makes it so incredibly charming for me, so my advice is...just play it for yourself.

well, a nice surprise. I don't like blood bowl very much and i wasnt expecting anything good from this one. I lost the game, i was last.
But I liked it pretty much! There's a lot of luck but there's also a lot of fun and you can actually devise different strategies to win: go immediately for points, go for star players, go for bonus cards, concentrate on more than a game, try to win the championships. There's a lot going on but it is simple to understand it and live it from the beginning. Very entertaining, varied, loads of surprises due to the skulls.

we played in 4 and it seems in 3 players it has some problems, be prepared to that...

Anyway, a very good 4 players game!

A simple card game that takes fantasy horde teams and pits them against each other through several games, (called match-ups), with varying perks to be won at each match-up, culminating in the 'Blood Bowl'. 

Managers, (players), will place each of their cards, (team members) into play trying to ultimately outdo their opponent with the numbers representing strength on each card. (Think Battleline). 

But, along with cards, players can add to the situation with the card text (team member special ability), and add in cheat tokens for surprise outcomes, and you have a super game. This is not football. But the football theme does this game very well, and it is a game I expect will stay a part of my game collection.

It didn't take us long to discover what Fantasy Flight should have known all along: The Staff Upgrade cards are game-swinging killjoys. At least FFG backpedaled with their recent [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/weblink/122211/official-faq-v1-0-for-blood-bowl-team-manager-th]FAQ[/url] and silently admitted that the cards were a mistake.

Blood Bowl's "fight for reward cards" approach has left me with a strong sense of deja vú, as I know that other games have used the same mechanic. But for the life of me I can't remember which ones.  So, to be as unhelpful and vague as possible, Blood Bowl may or may not be as good as those other games.  There's no doubt, though, that BB is longer and more random than its mechanical cousins, and that isn't a good thing.

At first, the game felt like a variant of [thing=372][/thing], which I wasn't keen on as a two-player game. Blood Bowl Team Manager plays up to four, though, so I was hoping to like it more. It's got elements of area control and collecting power-ups to help you later on, so it's a bit like an Ameritrash [thing=13642][/thing]. I like both Louis XIV and the original Blood Bowl, so I enjoyed this game too but it felt a little long for what it was.

The game gets the flavour of Blood Bowl right in some areas but misses in others. If they're going to use Blood Bowl's SPLAT symbol on the dice, you'd have thought they could also use the SKULL symbol instead of a cross. And it would have been nice to have a bit more control over which new players get added to your team.

Still, decent enough for a light-hearted, trash-talking session.

Designing Blood Bowl Team Manager was among the most rewarding and enjoyable experiences I've had.

Best with 4 players, okay-ish with 5, 6+ is a bad idea.

Dwarves suck, though. An easy pick for me and my group. I like the humor too.

The theme is incredibly well done here... so well done that despite the gameplay being nothing like "real" BloodBowl (expect the block dice... sort of...) you get a nice BB feel out of the game.  

This does have even less of a deck building feel than I expected... mostly due to the limited opportunities and sometimes choices of cards to add to your deck... but the card play on the highlights and the enjoyment of rolling some dice for blocks keeps this engaging and fun. In fact after the second game I'd been grunting for the blocks and cheering for my team so much my voice was a bit sore.  Any game that can get the players that involved on a turn by turn basis is a winner in my book... though the four player game does run a bit too long.

Very nice re-implementation of the Blood Bowl game.
At its core, this is a deck building game, but it doesn't feel like that (which is a thing I like). Some luck is involved, but I think it really gives the feeling of the miniature version of Blood Bowl on a much smaller scale. 
Up to now, all the plays have been engaging and tense. A really good game and I look forward to playing more!

Only 2-3 plays so far and all of those have been 2-player. I believe this game gets much, much better with 3-4 people so I'll probably re-evaluate my score once I get some experience with that but honestly; it's one of those games that doesn't really stand out terribly. Almost seems doubtful that we'll pick to play this over a lot of other things. Not a bad game though!

Poénos kis játék, jó az ötlet (persze régi, de jó, h társas is van belőle). A kártyavezérelt akció mondjuk sokat látott mechanizmus, de ezt a cuccot nem az innováció miatt fogod szeretni. Egy pár alkalom van benne, sokat nem kell várni tőle, de jó szórakozás.

This game is terrific!
It's just Blood Bowl without miniatures, but with cards very well illustrated. 
To win you have to collect more supporters than the other teams. Obviously you'll do this hitting hard your opponents.
IN THE NAME OF NUFFLE!

This is a cool cardgame but light and sometimes frustrating because of the luck of the dicerolls. It stays in the collection because I can play it with a group instead of just 1 on 1. 

I like the tactical play of putting units on locations, though Warhammer Conquest does this more in depth. 

A flaw in the game is that you sometimes can't ever come back, happened to me that I couldn't win anymore at the beginning of round 4 of 5. 

Powercreep: expansion races feel stronger than base races.

Good game. Sold as our group already had it.

Theme is very well rendered. Very good components quality. The box insert leaves a bit to be desired, but the rest is fantastic.

A bit of luck involved, but it doesn't detract from the fun.

Some match-ups seem to favor certain teams strongly over others, so I would recommend playing with 3.

Quick and easy to teach.

I'm hoping they will release more products in the Blood Bowl universe, or perhaps an expansion to this game :)

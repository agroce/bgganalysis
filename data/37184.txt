GAME: Dungeons & Dragons Miniatures Game (second edition)

I have a selection of uncommons and commons I've crossed over for use with Descent: JitD
I've read the rules but have yet to play the miniatures game as written.

RATING: 4
A redesign of the skirmish rules to better align with D&D 4.0 game-play, I was unhappy with the changes.

Great miniatures game. Good as a 'pull out and play' game using just the starter but even better when you have access to more miniatures from the boosters or secondary market. 

Uses a poster-size map board (overhead view) with squares on it instead of specially built tables with custom terrain (used by traditional miniatures war games) which makes it very compact for storage and doesn't take too long to setup to play.

The rules are simple enough to play with kids of 6+ if you help them, boys especially just like to kill the baddies :)

But the real beauty of the rules is that they have enough depth and variety of special abilities to engage older miniatures gamers who want to get into the Warband building aspect or even commit to the game as a longterm hobby. For those of a competitive nature WOTC and games stores run tournaments so the system is well supported by the producer.

The miniatures in the booster packs come with double-sided stat cards which include the 'Miniatures game' stats on one side and condensed 'RPG' stats on the reverse. The Starter set cards only includes stats for the Miniatures game with a few hints and tips on the reverse.

If you're new to miniatures games then it's cheap enough to check it out and it's ready to play out of the box (all the minis are painted - not great from a mini-gamers perspective but probably great for anyone new to the genre).

Didn't have a problem with first edition, but since they are redoing all the cards, this is fine, too.

I am not wasting my money on collectibles...
Ok maybe one booster every month...
I have 8 already...

Discontinued Thank God! Now I can get the minis that I really want for my D&D RPG.

Fun if you like the material and feels like 4th ed D&D with a lot of the extra stuff peeled away.  Collectible game, with all the ins and outs of that game type.

RATING: 5
Skirmish-level battles utilizing fantasy miniatures.  I preferred the 2003 rules to the later (2008) revision.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well-designed, easy-to-play skirmish level wargame that involves real tactical choices. Wonderful miniatures and maps! The volume of information on the stat cards can be overwhelming, so I prefer playing small 100p Warbands. Also, I use simplified rules to calculate LOS (or other lines). Best with 2 players and decent [color=red]solitaire[/color] play.
I use one D&D Miniatures Game set, three "Demonweb" Booster packs, one "Savage Encounters" pack and other D&D [u]minis[/u] and tiles.
All the stat cards are available for download at the Wizards site so you can play with different cards for any miniature.

My favorite collectible game. The new version of the rules are much better than the old ones. Lots of fun if these types of games are your bag. I do not record plays for this game, but it is in the hundreds.

  An 8 rating for the miniatures.  I actually like the softer plastic and the paint jobs aren't bad for pre-painted (which will never be as good as do-it-yer-self).  The sculptures are inspired and interesting, although while good for the skirmish game limit the usefulness in actual roleplaying games

  A 5 rating for the rules.  Basically a mindless dice fest but understandable and fun for kids.  I'd play it over some other systems (Heroclik).

  A 2 for value for money.  The collectable aspect of the boosters kill this game for me.  The figures are too 'odd' for role-playing or for much use other than the skirmish game.  The biggest problem is price.  A starter and a booster isn't worth value-wise  compared say to a complete Runebound board game of roughly the same cost

DDM did not do well in the port from 3rd ed to 4th ed. In fact it was completely lost in translation.

However, despite lacking the key appeal (strategic depth) of the first edition, second edition is workable and still fun.

I have about 30 of these, not enough to play with for long periods, but enough to get me hooked. Now, of course, they are going OOP. Oh well, that probably saved me $100's tracking down minis. Because I had so much fun with it, I ended up printing out proxy tokens for every monster in the game, including stat cards, so that I could continue to play even without the minis. All I can say is - rest your hand between cutting pages if you attempt this PnP nightmare... (although I was quite impressed with my old inkjet for how well it did)...

 A funny and simple game, though there's nothing brilliant in its design. The interaction between figs are really interesting, and you quickly learn from your mistake to build a better force. Its collectability and lack of a specific setting make me lower my own rating. The figs aren't spectacular, too (though there are nice ones).

I love the D&D miniatures, they just look so cool. Great to use for any D&D games/quest or just plain fun for the kids to enjoy. Shame they come in blind packs and no longer make them.

The minis are much nicer with second edition, albeit now at a slightly larger scale. The minis game has taken a step in the direction of 4th Edition, which is just fine for a minis game.

Despite the phrase "miniatures game" in the title, this is a boardgame that uses miniatures as playing pieces on a square-grid map. I love the miniatures, but I find the exceptions-based game system has too many fiddly details for me.

I'm really not big on collectible games at all any more but I have to admit to this game being a lot of fun. The turns are quick and easy but there are always a lot of interesting decisions and tactical options. Unfortunately a good deal of the fun for me is coming up with interesting army combination which means that the more miniatures I have the more options I have available to me for army construction. This leads to constantly wanting more miniatures. Fortunately my days of spending hundreds of dollars on collectible games has long since passed and I've been able to keep my spending on this game to a minimum while still having fun.

A bit of nice streamlining and trimming over the original, and I liked the change to maps from tiles. However, there was simply too much of a delay waiting for redos of all the stats, and it was too much of a pain to print them all. This made us quit D&D minis.

With the right group, this can generate a lot of laughs.  The rules in the box aren't particularly good, but playing with a variant where the card reader picks the best/funniest answer a la Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity makes this better.  Also, allow the card reader to continue to pick until they find a card they like.  Game can go 1-infinite rounds, so play until it is starting to overstay its welcome, then move on to something else.

With Official rules I'd rate this game: 4

With Custom rules - Where you simply have one guesser each turn that gets points for guessing each person's sentence and then rewards the person with the funniest or favorite sentence with a point.  Custom game rating: 6

RATING: 9
Party games generally fall in one of two categories: 
Either players are racing against a clock to do somthing difficult (like charades, Pictionary or Taboo) or they have to be creative with an answer to a situation (Balderdash, Scruples). I would consider this to be the best of the second category (Time's Up and Taboo being the best of the first category). 

The premise is simple (finish this sentence: "Things... you shouldn't do in church"). There's no point in playing to win (the scoring is pretty lame), but you'll never laugh as hard as you will hearing the answers to those questions, and trying to figure out who wrote what!

Sometimes you want a social game. This is an adequate social game. We played with four, and I think it would be more fun with a slightly bigger group, as it was easy to do process of elimination once you got one right. But, if I am looking for a social game (which i do on occasion), I would be up for playing this again.

RATING: 1
Takes forever and a day with eight people.

Things you shouldn't do at a party....play this game (an actual response I gave).

Unsurprisingly the biggest gossip in our group won this. This would be a fun activity without the guessing. Just make up funny stuff to amuse your friends. I tend to be good at doing that without a "game" to help.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
This game is just absurdly hilarious! I would be happy to play this quite regularly! "So why did the talking mouse only give it a 4.5 then?" Well......
The rules are very unclear on a number of points. In spite of that, the somewhat broken rules "feel" like Things is trying to be a "real" game, but on the level of "game", it's a pretty poor experience. Yes, you could try to play it quite seriously, but it so easily degenerates into an absurd gigglefest where people are writing answers that have utterly nothing to do with the subject, eg. (from actual game session): "Things that are harder than they look"; Answer: "Plaid". I mean, I love Things In a Box for the group giggles experience, but purely as a game (even on the level of "party game") it's rotten. And on the level of group giggles experience, it will ONLY work IF, and ONLY IF, you're playing with the right group of demented loons.
So for group giggles experience, I give it an 8; as a game, I give it a 1. Hence, my rating of 4.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I really find the point of this game (guessing what someone else wrote) rather boring and uninspired, not to mention the fact that I don't think it succeeds well in breaking ice and building social connections--the goal of a party game. All it does is re-enforce already existing cliques and inside jokes. 

At best, it passes some time... I guess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A bit of a memory game, a bit of a party game and a bit of a subjective comment/ tounge in cheek game.  Is it fun?  Depends on the people you play with.

With all the choices I have, I don't see the need to play this one again.  For me Apples to Apples was a better "party game" experience.

RATING: 8
A smarter version of a party game like Cards Against Humanity.  In this one one person is the reader.  They read a card out loud twice that says something along the lines of "Things you shouldn't say during an interview" and then everyone writes down an answer and passes their answer to the reader.  The reader mixes them up, reads all the answers out loud twice and it is up to everyone to remember what was said for answers.  No going back to re-read them.  Then the player to the left of the reader starts by trying to guess who said what.  Once they get one wrong the next player goes.  Each correct answer is a point.  I personally love this as a party game.

RATING: 7
A party game that tests your memory and your ability to predict how your friends will answer a question.  It works spectacular with moderately large groups and has been a big success for me with the youth group.  It's not one of my favorite party games, but it's a very good one.  Usually I am not a big fan of games that have no defined ending, but this one seems to work.  You just play the number of rounds you have time for and then the game is over.

What makes the game shine is the openness of the questions.  People are free to write just about anything, and even make jokes based on previous rounds.  The downside to the game is that the memory aspect can be a little too hard with a really large group.  And the bonus for the person who is left standing at the end of the round is a little too high, so it is virtually impossible to win the game without winning a round.

This is the only game I can think of that I've played alot & never had a "bad game".  
I always bring it to parties but it will bog down with more than a dozen people.
1 warning with most groups (even families) this game does tend to get progressively more adult answers.  
Goes well with alcohol & really loosens up a group.
But we play it with family regularly.

This is OK, but the constant need to repeat the clues for each successive guesser really sucks the fun out of it. And you can't visually examine the clues due to the possibility of recognizing handwriting.

RATING: 1
It sounds like an interesting idea: each person writes out their answer to a question (what your 11th commandment would be, how people refer to you), the player who is at bat tries to match the answers to the respondent.

Unfortunately it's rarely as fun as it looks. You need players who are willing to be funny or silly in order to make this game work. You also need to have players who can keep track of the answers in their head so the answers don't have to be read aloud for the eighth time.

Avoid.

Cheap and flimsy balsa wood box - I think it was dropped a couple times in transit to the store.  I took off the plastic wrap and found the box had broke so had to get the glue gun out.  Game is kinda fun.  The best strategy is to pick boring and mundane answers.  However, if you forego the strategy to go for funny/entertaining answers everyone will have more fun.  We decided halfway through after a couple of dull cards to allow the asker to pick their favorite from three and that really helped the game.

Things has been a top favourite party game for many of my friends for a long time. With the right group of people the answers can get as dark and funny as you want, although you'll want to make sure everyones on the same page. It's also a decent game for younger kids as the answers can be pretty goofy. I wouldn't play it with less than 5 and rounds get too long with much more than 8 although people can always buddy up. This game really is up to the group to make it enjoyable.

Fun party game where things almost always inevitably turn to the "inappropriate".  The only problem is that the larger the group, it grows significantly longer in length, due to the "guessing until someone gets it right" factor. This could benefit more from Balderdash-type rules to speed it up.

It is basically a memory and guessing game.  Try to remember the answers after they are read, then randomly take a shot in the dark guess who wrote what.  If you guess wrong, you're done.  Now sit and watch as the next player's lucky guess gives them a point...and another guess.  It is okay as a social game for some lighthearted fun, but it seems most of the laughs are generated from base inappropriate humour. It does work with those who are total non-gamers. But there are much better party games on the market.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Pretty awful.  We got some laughs for about 5 or 10 minutes, then the "game" started to really drag.  The end of each round is broken.  When there are 2 people and the reader left, it can become a painful ritual where you wait until someone can guess the one person left to guess...and hope that they've go the right quote.

There is a decent kernel of a game idea here, but it was poorly executed.  That this was published shows a lack of caring about the final product. I suppose played purely as an activity (not a game) there may be some merit, but there are many much better social games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Not much of a game here. Terribly tedious with more than four players, but requires far more than four to make the broken scoring system (partially) function. Dreadful.

RATING: 5
It's an OK party game that requires some creativity.  I liked the various categories and having to make up our own answers, but the guessing part of the game quickly grew tedious.  When playing with more than 6 or 7, it's just too difficult to remember what all the answers were without them being displayed somewhere, plus going around the room several times, one by one, to guess who wrote which answer slows down the fun of the game.  Anyone can play it, and there's potential here, but it feels like a slower, more tedious variant of Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity.

Though we haven't played it recently, it's an excellent 6 to 10 player party game.  We end up laughing the whole time.

Not sure if it's a house rule we made up or not: The reader goes through them three times.  No one is allowed to take notes.  The reader does not go through them again unless you go all away around the circle, there are four players left, and no one can remember.

Fun for large-group play. Challenging to be creative in your answers for some questions like, "What dogs are really saying when they bark." If you're too literal it's boring ("feed me! or "my yard!" or "you're home!") and if you're too far out "The revolution starts now... Fido, Sparky, man your stations!" or "I miss my grandpa!" you get pegged as the one who gives kooky answers and are easily eliminated. So you gotta walk the line. Or just give up and be the one who always answer "farts" or "motorcycles," no matter what the question is.

Positives:
* VERY fun game for groups of 5-8 people
* Lots of cards however it would have also been nice if they put 3 things on each card to choose from. There is the room.


Negatives:
* Way overpriced for what you get.
* Memory is a major issue for larger groups and the reader will constantly have to repeate the answers.
* The scoring method is poor, most people will adjust this with house rules.
* Poor hand writing can also be a issue.

OK, I usually like party games. More so than other types, Party Games are more about the social interaction of the players than the actual winning, and I am a social animal.  I thrive in group situations where everyone is laughing and having a good time.  So why the lower rating?  I simply didn't care for the mechanics.  There's too much trying to remember what was said, then trying to guess who said what.  I felt like I was taking a pop quiz.  So, yes, it's fun, but there are better social games out there.

RATING: 6
Things is absolutely hilarious with the right group of people, but it can also fall apart under certain conditions.

Here are the two aspects I don't like about Things:

1) Some players try to game the system by not answering the question. This is good strategy, but it is not much fun. I think the rules to a good party game should motivate the players to do the fun activity. That way people who care about winning are motivated to do that activity that is fun. In Things, players are motivated to be random, so that the active player cannot figure out who wrote their answer.

2) Things can fall apart with a large group of people because it's tough to decide who wrote each of the 10 possible answers. In fact, Things is the only party game I've seen get bogged down with AP on more than one occasion.

[at least 3 plays] How can I find the words to describe my loathing of this dreadful game?  My group usually plays this in a variant way, with "Apples to Apples" rules.  I have played once by the true rules, though.  This falls into a larger category that I dislike: party games that require you to creatively make stuff up.  It usually degenerates into people running the same few jokes into the ground for ages.  Others enjoy this nonsense, but I just sit there thinking, "I could have been playing a game now and having fun."  This game makes me feel like an animal in a trap, and I want to chew off a limb and escape.  I have promised myself NEVER to play this again.

Gaming: This game turns into a memory game if no one can figure out who said what. The fun is lost.

Fun party game, a good game to break out if you don't want to play time's up all night.  we had about 13 people, and most of us agreed it was a tad bit too many.  It worked, but we certainly didn't give everyone a chance to be the reader.  The funniest part was often having all the papers read.  It felt like it took a bit too long to come back around to your turn.  The game is prone to some problems.  People ganging up on someone to guess them out.  People repeating the same answer over and over on different people until they find the right one.  Most significantly, the game can encourage and rewards non-creative, bland, forgettable answers.  I do believe this one depends largely on the group, they really need to try to be funny while still not drawing attention to themselves - rather than other games which you don't need to try to be funny.  That being said, we had some absolutely hilarious times & answers written down during our game.  I think 7-10 creative, social, funny, intelligent people would be the sweet spot with this one.

This game is awesome with the right crowd of people. It manages to have a beautiful arc in the gameplay:

1) At first everybody is just trying to make each other laugh.
2) People start mimicking each other's styles in order to survive longer
3) Pants-wetting hilarity
4) Inside jokes start coming up as the game gets stale and people's brains become tired because they don't realize how hard they've been working. (we know this happens when more than 3 people write "a fart" as their thing). 
5) Pack it away with fond memories, avoiding burnout as you finished on a happy note.

Answer silly questions, then guess who wrote down which answer... simple, kinda monotonous, but wow did we have fun playing it for some reason.  So for that, I can not give it a bad score.

Party game that does generate some laughs, but has numerous flaws.  There is virtually NO information on which to base your guesses, so they truly are a shot-in-the-dark.  Players are eliminated from a round if someone guesses there answer, and this may occur even before they have a chance to score points.  As a round progresses, players who come later in the turn -- if they have not been eliminated -- have a better chance of guessing right and scoring points.  The game fails on many levels as a "game", but does generate some laughs.  Still, there are MANY better party games out there.

RATING: 6
A fun game for players to write down explicit and inappropriate answers for a particular question or topic. For an intimate play session, the game will allow for some interesting revelations about your fellow player.

However, same style of play can also lead to an awkward admission at family gatherings or games with strangers. Hopefully by game's end, everyone will have opened themselves to these funny answers. Generally, this occurs and everyone has at least one memorable answer from a previous game of things.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another party game following the wave of Apples to Apples clones, Things is all about guessing which player wrote which answer to each question. Creates a good amount of laughs, but there isn't much game here. The scoring system is pretty flawed and doesn't really do a good job of rewarding the best guesser. It would probably be more fun not to score it at all. There are a fraction of the cards that are simply boring, to the point that we said "eh, pick a different one" to the reader, and that isn't a good sign. It's a good idea for a game, but it's pretty unpolished. The masses won't care about that I suppose, but gamers will want to find a different party game.

Probably my second favorite game in the whole "one person selects a card, everyone else tries to match it" genre behind Dixit.  Why?  Because it actually allows for individuals to create their own clever answers, instead of relying on the cards to be humorous a la Cards Against Humanity.  Biggest issue?  There is really no reason to buy a produced copy-  it can verrrrrry easily be DIY'ed.

One of the few party games I enjoy due to the social deduction and metagaming(Using self deprecation to make it seem like someone at the table has a grudge against you, or when a straight-man tells a funny-man joke or vice versa, or using the same answer twice in a row) potential. The memorization part should be ignored, since uncontested skills don't make for fair or fun games.

One downside I've encountered is that some players may choke like a dear in headlights when they are put on the spot.

Our group is pretty irreverent and terrible, so this game gets pretty raunchy and awful fast, which makes it great.

Games which are focused more on one's relationships to and knowledge of the other players rather than game mechanics are not for me. This one is kind of weird because you end up with people bluffing and hoping you'll think they sound like someone else and it doesn't work because everyone's doing it so it turns into a mostly random double-guessing kind of thing. It's also tedious because of the constant "can you repeat all the answers again?" after every guess.

Things... is a party game where everyone writes a response to a particular prompt, such as "Things... you shouldn't put in your mouth," and the players then try to guess which player wrote which response.

A reader is chosen. This reader reads aloud a Topic Card. The players all write a response, fold up the slip of paper and turn it in to the reader, who reads them aloud once and then a second time. The player to the left of the reader has to guess who wrote which response. This is all done from memory, without benefit of taking notes or having the responses read again. If the guesser is correct, he or she continues guessing until incorrect, at which time the player to his/her left tries guessing. Players whose responses were correctly identified are eliminated and cannot make guesses. The round ends when one player has not been matched to a response.

1 point is awarded for each correct guess. 6 points are awarded to the person who successfully avoided detection. The job of reader passes to the left. When everyone has been reader once, the game ends. High score wins.

Things is a party game.  In it the active player will draw a card and read it to the group.  It may say something like, "Things you wish were taught in school".  Everyone then writes an answer on a piece of paper, and they all give their answer to the active player.  That person then reads all the answers, and everyone excluding the active player, takes turns trying to guess who wrote which answer.  If they guess correctly they get a point, and the person who was matched to their answer is out for that turn.  This goes on until all but one player is eliminated.  Then the person to the left of the active player becomes the new active player, and it all begins again.  The game ends at an agreed upon number of rounds and the winner is the one with the most points.

Things is a fairly decent game for a laugh or two.  It has a few problems though.  The entertainment value of the game is dependent upon the creativity of the players, and their ability to connect with the card that's been read.  Also, the game tends to spiral quickly down to very base humour.  So, if that's not your thing, then you may want to avoid it.  Also, as stated above, players are eliminated from competition each round until the next card is read.  This can make for quite a bit of down time.

There's another party game called Say Anything that has a similar vibe.  However, in it, after the statement is read, everyone writes down their answer, and reveals it immediately.  The active player then secretly chooses the answer they like best.  After that everyone bets on which answer they think the active player picked.  Finally, the active player reveals their choice, and players score points based on whether they bet correctly or not.  No one is eliminated during play.  Due to this twist of betting, and lack of player elimination, I think Say Anything does Things...better.

RATING: 7
Great party game, especially for a group that knows each other really well.  Don't play with groups larger than 7 or 8.  We enforce a rule that all responses will be read twice by the reader and not re-read until everyone has had their turn (to prevent players from asking to hear all the responses every 20 seconds).

A party game that doesn't suck - assuming you can play it in the kind of company that will allow you to indulge your impulse for innuendo, vulgarity, crudeness, shock, and dirty pun. Otherwise, this would be insanely painful, awful and boring.


Example:
Topic: "Things you don't want to find in your attic."

NOT FUN: "Old clothes from the 1970's"
FUN: "Grandpa, dead of auto-erotic asphyxiation."

If you can't handle the second example there, you probably wouldn't be invited to game with us anyway, but the game shines when everyone has had a few beers and let's the horrible side of their imagination run around naked with a blowtorch and a bottle of whipped cream. So to speak.
------------------------------

Edit: The wife and I sat down and made a homebrew version of this with a deck of index cards. Now it it is even more brilliant, because it includes inside jokes, categories that even further suggest innuendo, and general hilarity. Played with the homebrew deck, this is an 8.

I truely dread this game entering the rotation.

Should a particular female gamer participate in one of my gaming groups semi-regular sessions, I know that I'll be subjected to over an hour of this stinker of a game.  An hour I will never get back ...

In the most recent torture session, the 'Thing' for round four was, 'Things you want to do before you die.'  My answer, 'Survive this game!'  By round six I was begging for death!

Generally, the majority of the group's strategies degenerate into incorperating someone else's previous answer into their current one, making it more difficult to determine the current responder's identity.  *sigh*  Lame.

Avoid this highly over-rated party game at all costs and play something more amusing, and challenging, like Scattegories.

This is probably my favorite "mindless" party game.  It plays best when you know most of the people that are playing, but is a nice ice-breaker for a mixed crowd too.

It plays differently depending on the crowd - can go from squeaky clean family fun to very crude adult humor.

An interesting little party game. A sentence is read and each player finishes the sentence. "I really wish I were better at..." and so forth. This is one that really should be played with people you don't know well and helps you get to know them better. That way, people can be answering honestly. I played with my family and it quickly turned into completely random answers or answers meant to throw people off by writing things that would obviously be something another player at the table would answer. To win, you have to guess the most answers without having people guess yours (since it boots you from the round). In the spirit of the game, you shouldn't "play to win". My family did have a lot of fun with our answers and it got a lot of laughs.

Works much better than I expected from reading the brief rules. As with many party games, I really doubt this would work in a group of strangers. Given the right group, it's very entertaining, especially when people write things that are extremely out of character.

Things was originally an 8, but over time it dropped to a 6 or 5. However, after Cards Against Humanity came out, we realized that things is basically just a write your own version of that monstrosity. Which bumped it back up to an 8. One of my favorite party games, Things is awesome for non gamers and is sure to get you laughing hysterically at some of the crazy things your friends and family will come up with.

Fun party game in the vein of Balderdash. Plays better with more than four people. As usual, pick a fun crowd for this one. No one wants to play a game like this with that weird uncle who has no sense of humor and sells cleaning supplies for a living.

I wasn't overly impressed after the first play, although it seemed quite novel and I was keen to try again.  But since then I've played it several more times, and a few times with lots of people, and have come to the conclusion that it's a great party game for about 8 or 9 people who know each other fairly well.  Not so good with only 4.

Another classic, family favorite for at least a decade, probably longer. I don't like memory components in all games, but I do like it here. Love the think and doublethink that goes on to make you answer sound like another person's answer. Crazy hilarious answers, but real skill applies in deducing who would write what. My brother Victor says he has this game beat--instead of writing crazy and funny answers or trying to sound like someone else, he writes the most boring and non-descript answer possible, such that it's hard to keep in the mind when spoken next to all of the more colourful answers. It's a good strategy, but sometimes makes his answers stick out like a sore thumb.

Although I tend to prefer strategy games, this is one of the better party games.  My game playing friends vary from those who prefer strategy to those who would always rather play a party game.  When we do play Things (and I'd say we've played it 4 times now), it never fails that we end up laughing hysterically at some point, and we then, over the next few weeks will reference the question that pushed us over the top.  For example, my friend who is a 1st grade school teacher chose the question: Things you shouldn't say to your children.  To hear her forced to read the things that people wrote down was priceless.  I laughed so much that my stomach started to hurt.  

Note of warning: this game often degenerates into um, how shall I say, gutter thinking.  Or maybe it's just my friends.  

One more thing, you could make up this game yourself.  You don't need to buy it, but the designers did a good job of coming up with interesting and varied suggestions.  And the production value of the game, with a wooden box, is very nice.

RATING: 5
Picked up in good condition from Goodwill.  This completely bombed with my family, which is who I typically play party games with.  I think everyone took it too seriously  and we have specific people that always are the jokers so if they write something funny it's too easy to know who they are. The game also suffers from when one person starts to guess correctly, they just keep going, getting most of the points for the round. It's similar to Balderdash, which is  a much better game.  I could see this potentially being fun with the right group as others have mentioned in their reviews, but I think I will let this one go from the collection.

RATING: 5.5
This game is not enjoyable with only four or five people. In these cases, it is easy for the person who guesses correctly first to subsequently guess every other play, ending the round. I like between eight and ten. If you are able, I recommend setting up a service for people to submit their answers to via a website or text, and display the answers on a screen (or directly on the player devices). It eliminates the essential loss of a player to the role of reader and keeps the gameplay focused, rather than stalling, trying to remember what was said, or asking for repeats (depending on how you play).

That said, Things... lost its luster pretty quickly, and it is rare that enough people are together to make it worth the time.

We've found that ditching the game aspect in favor of conversation starters has been much more fun and effective.  The prompts are fun and students enjoy talking about the topics, but writing down your own guesses and trying to decide who said what removes a lot of the spontaneity from the experience.

RATING: 5
For a while this was our favorite game for get-togethers with friends.  It plays somewhat similar to Say Anything.  The reader reads a category that starts with the game's namesake "Things..." such as "Things not to say during a job interview".  Then everyone writes an answer down and passes it to the reader.  The reader reads the answers and taking turns the other players have to guess who said what.

So it starts out as a game of knowing your friends and how they would respond.  And I did love how the game can adjust to how innocent, weird, or vulgar the group your playing with is.  But eventually everyone TRIES to answer like someone else and really the guessing stage is just blind guessing at that point and not as much fun.  But with different groups that haven't played it as often it can still be a fun party game.

RATING: N/A
A party game where everyone had to write down an answer, and the objective is to guess what other players have submitted.  A favorite with the in-laws, and we have several recurring jokes that come up every time.  One of the main issues with the game is that with a larger group, half of the answers are forgotten before the reader is finished going through the list, and players are constantly asking which answers are left, and which players can still be guessed.  It's still a fun mainstay for our family get-togethers.

RATING: 6.5
While "Things..." is a fun game in its own right, it just doesn't quite stack up with the other "make stuff up" games, such as "Absolute Balderdash", "Why did the Chicken...?", "Quip it!", and "Wise and Otherwise".  Part of the problem is the terrible method of scoring, which various people have attempted to house-rule.  I simply have a different person be the "guesser" for each round and score points based on how many responses they can correctly match up with the people who wrote them.  Also, I'm dumbfounded by the insanely over-produced wooden box!!  They could have packaged up this little game in a cardboard box half that size and sold it for half the price!  However, "Things..." does fit right into my sweet spot for party games and is definitely good for a laugh, which is the most important thing.  I've thrown it into one box with the four other above-mentioned games and created the ultimate "make stuff up" party game!  But I've kept the wooden box.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 6.5/10

RATING: N/A
Just an unsuspecting party game. But I've seen it bring some incredibly shy people out of their shell. Most sessions of Things... I've played has ended up soaked in an accumulation of random, shocking, and often dark or racy subject matter. I once played it with my extended family amongst grandparents and children. It added quite the challenge since we all had to abstain from drawing ideas from that ever so accessible gutter. We were playing with children as young as nine, and it remained fun, absurd and innocent. Another round of gameplay included an individual who played in a very serious manner. Very methodical and organized, he wrote each subject answer in a different party goer's personality and grammatical style. I've always been surprised with the variety of strategy used on one dumb party game... that's saying something.

One of the first party games that got me back into gaming of any sort. Had a lot of fun playing with larger groups. Has been a very reliable source of enjoyment.

UPDATE: The publisher and their agency are now giving cease and desist letters to any game with "Things" in the title.  I supported a kickstart campaign for a game called "Terrible Things" that is NOTHING remotely like Things...  I removed my 8.5 rating and put a 1 in now - Quinn and Sherry can go bite my shiny metal ass if this is how they treat their fans and competitors.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light party game, where players write down answers to prompted questions, and then compete to correctly guess which answers belong to which players, in the process correctly guess answers eliminate the author from further play in the round. Last player guessing wins the round. The game is best with a large group, probably 6+

When we played with 4 players the experience was a little dry, However, in that game, we decided each player would submit 2 answers, instead of one, and that enriched the experience quite a bit.

This is an absolute MUST for a party game! You can be crazy, ridiculous and or just bizarre with your answers lol. The better you know someone, the easier the game is for you to win. Sometimes it's worth just putting something funny down just to have them read it and laugh your ass off with it! Ex. "Things that never last" and I put "Do you like Pina Coladas? Getting caught in the rain?" HAHA! It made no sense but hearing someone read that is priceless and worth losing the round for!

Things that shouldn't be boxed up and sold...  Things that were created in one afternoon based on a free parlour game with cards that were never playtested...

Like a way worse Apples to Apples.
It's complicated and not very fun.
Even if you ignore the rules and just have the one person pick the best answer or try to guess who wrote what, it's annoying that another person has to read the answers aloud because you can recognize hand writing and then you forget what some of the responses were and have them repeated to you... ugh.

This is a really good game for a large number of players.  It really works well to *break the ice* and is quite funny.  However, I wouldn't recommend playing this game with people that you have JUST met.  Players' responses can often be *colourful* which isn't always a good thing.

One thing that I really don't like is that the game rewards memory and luck too strongly.  Certain players just dominate (and for some reason it is always a woman, although not necessarily the SAME woman) without any tangible reason why.

It's actually quite fun for the first 30 minutes. After that it overstays its welcome. Then it stays the night, and never leaves. A month later you're telling Things to pack its stuff up and get out. 3 months later it finally leaves after you threaten to call the cops.

The game thrives on around 8-10 people. However, the game has an exponential time limit. Each round takes about 2 minutes per person. The game lasts a number of rounds equal to the number of people. So at 4 people you have a 30 minute party game, which is great, but the game sucks with 4 people. At 8 the game starts picking up, but it's now a 2 hour journey in hell. The gameplay sucks when the length is right and the length is unbearably long when the gameplay starts being fun.

It's been many many years since I played this and the BGG ranking suggests I might be looking at it through rose-colored glasses. But I always had fun, and giving players agency by having them write their answers instead of choosing one from a random hand of cards, like Apples to Apples, is a plus to me.

Juego original algo lento y repetitivo. Imposible de reflejar el vaivén en el desierto entre los dos bandos sin algunas reformas que he realizado para simplificar la labor burocrática.
Se recomienda ralentizar la recuperación de unidades reconstruidas de los Aliados para evitar que tengan tanta ventaja.
Aun así dispone de algunas mecánicas (armas combinadas, integridad divisional, O'Connor y Rommel) que le dan sabor histórico.

RATING: 7
Good game on the 1940 - 1943 period in Northern Africa. Too dependent on die rolls for me: at 9:1 you still can have A1/D1 results. Extremely difficult for the Axis players, who must roll very well to have some possibilities of victory: Commonwealth forces have a great advantage in supply and reinforcements.

I bought this one on the strength of my initial reaction to TME, my first SCS game. After several playings of TME however I find the SCS system too broadbrush, so this was traded away unpunched & unplayed, otherwise I suspect I'd be rating it a 4. Based on other comments on the game, maybe I ought to check out the 1/e?

Interesante juego. Hace énfasis en el suministro, tanto por transporte naval como terrestre. Interesante y prometedor. El sistema de juego no es confuso. Las reglas son claras y el mapa tiene un montón de iconos de ayuda muy oportunos. Bien diseñado. Vale la pena. Seguiré probándolo.

Very quick playing. Covers the North African campaign from the start unlike some games which only start with the German involvement. The supply and steps system are very much simplified from OCS.

RATING: 5
The SCS system, with the possibility of three attacks (overrun, combat and exploitation) and two moves per turn offers the prospect of a very fluid game of punch and counter-punch, well suited to this setting.  However, on the basis of one play of the Crusader scenario, Afrika does not seem to deliver on that.  

I think that supply is at the root of my problems with this game.  Its limited range and the difficulty of transporting it to the front combine to keep the main action compressed around the coastal highway.  The dire consequences of going out of supply curtail flamboyant blitzkrieg tactics.  On top of that, I don't play wargames to run logistical operations - and that's what I seemed to spend a significant portion of my time doing.

The map is good looking, though lacking some functionality.  Hexes are small and in congested areas things get quite fiddly.  Production quality is standard MMP, which is to say thin paper maps and small, thin counters.  The rulebooks are an easy read, though I felt that the game specific rules booklet could have been better ordered.

Afrika gets an extra couple of rating points from me because it's such a good introduction to its big brother, DAK II and the Operational Combat Series (OCS).  Of the 4 SCS games I've played this is head and shoulders the best of the bunch.  I found Bastogne, Stalingrad II and Rock of the Marne tedious and uninteresting.

RATING: 7.5
Very nice. The system actually conceals strategic and tactical complexities that only become apparent in play, and it does it very well. A bit like othello or go in that sense. A most excellent bit of vanilla wargaming. I played a third of the campaign game and I feel like it taught me a hundred lessons about hex and counter games.

RATING: 6.5
I found this to be a rather odd little game. Actually, despite the relatively small number of counters and simple rules, there is a lot of game here. That is good and fully justifies the extra 0.5 in my rating.

On the other hand, supply takes on a role of such immense importance (as it should) that it begins to dominate your thinking. I played via PBEM which in and of itself causes analysis paralysis, but even so I was taking 2+ hours for some turns trying to get the right balance of units vs supply. I found that I was worried more about supply than the enemy! LOL!! This game is for experienced wargamers or perhaps WW2 North Africa fanatics only.

Anyway, it is a beautiful looking game that I would never, ever play FtF. I cannot even imagine how one would...

PROS: Good simulation. Relatively small rules set. Interesting situation. Lots of bang for your buck. Some Fog of War due to inability to peek into opponent's stacks.

CONS: Long turns due to supply calculations. Slightly fiddley combat due to several variables which may need double-checking in other hexes (such as Divisional Integrity).

Even in the quick-playing SCS format, with monthly turns, the desert campaign is long. However, this makes a very decent fist of an historical game; the supply rules are quirky but have the desired effect of focussing both sides' minds on ports and the coastal road.The pre-Rommel game has been partially fixed from the first edition; the Italians must now advance on Mersa Matruh with sufficient force, but once O'Connor has chopped that part of their army up, the remaining infantry is likely to make a stand of it in the Tobruk and Bardia fortifications. It'll take good (and lucky) Allied play to be able to oppose Rommel's entry in Cyrenaica.Like all SCS games, the dice will play a big part in the game: as well as combat, a few low rolls on the port capacity tables can make either side's life very difficult without much warning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very pretty game, but sadly, when I played it against someone, it just felt like WWI.  As seems to often be the case, going by other replays and pics I have seen, in our game the Brits never took Tobruk.  The game was just trench warfare around the Libyan-Egyptian border.  No maneuver whatsoever. 

Because the Italian initial forces survived 1940, they ate enormous amounts of supply just to stay alive in their own rear area, which made no sense and constricted further Axis reinforcements from coming on.  The long range desert group counter (LRDG) had a bizarre and ahistorical effect on Axis supply that was way out of proportion to what it should have, since it can keep reappearing and sitting on the coast road, way behind Axis front lines. 

I imagine this is one of those games where it can be fun if players just act aggressively for no reason - it might lead to lower counter densities and more fluid situations.  With conservative play, it's a bore, and nothing like the real war.  It needs some kind of VP mechanic or something to drive play and force players to get out of their trenches.  As it is, it totally depends on your opponent's personality - something, alas, you don't have control over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really like the way supply is handled, and also the replacement and withdrawal rules. A nice medium/light complexity handling of the campaign. Nice components, and I find it solos well. Had some real come and go in the campaign. Those Panzer and Armoured divisions can be really good at attacking, but one or two losses quickly blunts their effectiveness. Also the huge variations on the CRT tables can lead to lucky rolls really derailing an attack or uprooting a defensive line.

Tobruk as was historically the case is key for me, and so battles can tend to bog down around there. Supply can be stock-piled to a degree before embarking on an offensive, as should be the case. But random rolls, particulary for the Axis can lead to chronic supply shortages just at the wrong time.

Great choices in a great game. Rating may go up with more plays...

Beautifully produced, but unfortunately tends to follow historic lines.  Practically impossible for Axis to win given reasonably competent Allied play.  Replayability is too low IMHO, campaign takes days to play.

Initial rating after a single play.  I like the simple mechanics (except the dumb round up/round down rule that simply requires a calculator but adds no real value.)  The supply mechanics are pretty simple, but add a lot of book keeping overhead...get ready to count out 14 units a lot, that's how many units a single supply point can support.  What I like about the supply mechanics is how concrete (non-abstract) they are.  You actually have to truck or ship supplies to the front to keep your forces intact.

Full-throttle fun, tempered by straightforward supply rules that demand you deal the whoop-arse with smarts.

The prevailing opinion is that the campaign game faithfully captures the ebb and flow of the North African war with low overhead. So true. And when in the hands of two experienced wargamers, the game gets tense and entertaining. In a lot of ways, it feels like a test of nerves. Damnation, or salvation, feels like it's always just a turn away. Good fun. I almost always end up playing it twice in a row. One player always wants "one more try."

RATING: 7
Un des meilleurs jeux de la série SCS avec beaucoup de mouvements et de manoeuvres à envisager.
Les parties risquent néanmoins de se ressembler avec un recul prématuré des Italiens et un front qui se stabilise autour de Bardia. On assiste ensuite à une guerre d'attrition nettement moins conforme à la campagne historique.
Matériel très agréable.

I own all the SCS games and enjoy the ease of play.  We found Afrika II did not work. The Brits can't drive too deep early because Rommel comes onto the map pretty fast.  So the Brits build up at Masah Matruh and await the Axis.  The Axis then pound that point for many turns and realize it is WWI.  Why bother.  Seems to be too many units.  You can always replace your loses.  Advantage is to attack each turn but doesn't really bother the defender, take a few hits on 3 attacks replace with replacements and other units and stand and fight.   The only way to force the game into some fun would be make the Brits race across the map for Victory points then make the Axis to the same.  Just doesn't work now with two competent gamers. Sad :-(

Afrika 2nd edition is a nice addition to my SCS game collection. The big campaign game starts off with extremely low counter density and then slowly builds in size over time, allowing the players to get their feet wet gradually. The two maps are some of the nicest SCS maps to date. I like the supply rules which include expenditure of supply points to keep units in supply, coastal shipping, port capacities, and truck points. It sounds complex at first, but it's simple and seamless in play. Good job, Gamers! (I never played the original edition, so I rate this edition on it's own merits)

I am not totally sure about this one. This is a long game and with the CRT set as it is, it seems that you can do ok with quite low odds if you roll well. But if your rolls are really bad even the high odds won't save you.

The main problem however is in the campaign game. If Allies roll well on reinforcements there is no way Axis can win against the Undead horde of the Commonwealth.

Other than that the flow is interesting and tension is definitely there.

As seems typical for SCS games, the scenarios seem unbalanced.  Have played two scenarios and both seem near-unwinnable for one side.  The supply rules are good, and it has a lot of historical flavor - it feels like a North Africa game.  Would like to try the campaign game sometime.

Excellent game on the North African campaign 1940-1942. Numerous scenarios can be played for those short of time, or can be used as a starting point for a campaign.

When I like a game, I typically really like it.  I LOVE THIS GAME.  This, in my opinion is the best of SCS.  A brilliant little gem that makes you feel you are in North Africa suffering the woes of the Italian commander and all the problems faced by DAK.

The supply system makes you feel the frustration that must have been felt by the armies fighting in this theatre.  

This game is well worth the money, in fact, for what you are getting here, IT IS A STEAL!!!!  Buy it, PLAY IT!!  You won't regret it.

Midway through the campaign and I am awe-struck by Dean's design.

Old-Fashioned Game of the Standard Combat Series. Emphasis on supply. Short and clear rules. It takes some effort to manage supply and reinforcement. Short szenarios and long campaings are possible. Initiative is switching often so both sides have to press and to defend some rounds.

A nice little tabletop "Beer & Pretzels" game. What you would expect from the Standard Combat Series (SCS) of games. A "Little Brother" game to the larger more detailed DAK2 OCS game. Good maps, counters and simple rules make this game a lot of fun. A game I highly recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

RATING: 8
A great game, the power of the offense is balanced by the logistic rules and more reasonable Movement allowances. To play well you will need to plan ahead and prepare your offenses. The defender needs to keep a mobile reserve ready, a static defense does not work in this game.  Makes for very mobile play. In fact once the two armies are locked in combat it feels like you are 'riding the tiger' ... as in you must hold on for dear life as to get off will let the the other side a chance to crush you. Captures the feeling of the 'pendulum of war' nicely

(caveat...This game has a rule that kills units that stopped in an overstack during retreat, but allowed them to retreat through the same overstack situation...this felt illogical and wrong to me and I refuse to play with this Stupid rule as written)

I replayed this again, solo, but with different approaches for each side, and it provided a very interesting see-saw/tug-of-war battle. Combination of maneuver, slogfest, and advance/retreat. 

Quite enjoyable, and very rewarding for players who dont sit back on the defensive...if one person makes a real push, then it becomes a fantastic game.

-------
Seems fairly boring honestly. The supply rules are really interesting and very much a part of the core gameplay. But this may be the cause of the pain...if you don't get off to a good push, you will get bogged down by the supply and no longer be able to comfortably advance.

Must be a willingness to take losses that I am missing here...

My first SCS and really an excellent game. Captures the essential dynamics of the desert: tenuous operations at the end of a long and fraying supply chain, broad flanking maneuvers, and big swings of fortune. Impressive too that battles tend to develop at historical locales, notably the complex terrain around Tobruk/Bardia and the natural defense line of Alamein. The key to all this is not only the supply rules as many others have commented, but also the benefit of the extensive terrain analysis for DAK. And the price is a steal.

Just a great game.  While the supply rules are a little more involved than other SCS titles, this just reflects the nature of the campaign.  As the Axis you have all the supply you need but limited ways to move it, and as the Allies you will have to scrounge around to keep everything in supply.
Very evocative game, that involves lots of tough decisions.  Joy to play solo as well.

Still in the middle of the first game, but no surprise, it is an improvement over the original, which I also liked.

After playing this one more, I've fallen in love with it. The supply rules require careful planning, but that fits with the nature of the North African campaign. This game is a hell of a lot of fun. 

I think that the attack is too powerful, but I need to play more before knowing for sure.

A good game in the SCS series. Liked the treatment of the initial Italian/British campaign. It covers the back and forth nature of the North African war well. The supply rules seem to fit with the theme.

If you like logisitcs, then this is your game, as you will spend at least half the time placing your supply points on the map (SPs) in their most effective locations. Not a good reflection of the historical campaign in that the arrival of the Afrika Korps saw sweeping and encircling maneuvers that just are not possible in this game due to the limitations of the supply rules. The net results are methodical and ponderous head-on battles to move along the coast road east and west. You won't see a replay of the Beda Fomm battle here. In addition, it contains some really wonky design decisions. For example, it takes only one SP to immediately replace your three step strongest unit that was just eliminated in battle, effectively seeing the same full strength unit reappear in the same place in the same game-turn it was eliminated. O'Connor is given the exact same benefits as Rommel (what historian was referenced in making this design decision?) I haven't studied the OOB in detail, but a cursory look reveals the panzer units to be comparable in strength to their Brit counterparts. That is suspect, for sure. 
I would love to talk to the developer and playtesters of this game. For me, another SCS failure, and I have now played four different ones. Time to move on.

solid, playable. Italian units should have had different color. antitank units should have weak strengths, and doubled vs armor. clear terrain should be 1.5 MP- a bit too easy to do supply raids- recommend using sleds to hide units. overrun should be 1 col shift to left. But these are relatively minor complaints. update: It too much staying power. need option to pay a supply to attack again, or roll more dice for larger combats- too easy to roll a1d1 and need 4 months to take benghazi.

SCS is a great series and I like this scale for North Africa.  I just do not have the time to play the full game and I have grown to like CDG's over hex and counter games for this scale of games.

Traded away.

Played for the first time, seems to be an excellent game but I need to get a handle on how to play it better before I try to rate it. Boy!, it is a struggle for the Axis to get supply to the front. Want to play it again.

A splendid little game, great for beginners and fun for veterans. The supply system is simple but effective. No more running out in the desert to flank your opponent without some thinking. Makes me appreciate how much planning it takes to launch a sustained offensive. The play time is just a few hours. I will play again. After playing I bought DAK 2, good call Arthur.

A good case of simple but not simplistic. A beginning wargamer can pick this up and start playing within an hour. But veterans can still discover and attempt different plans. A near perfect game if you like North Africa but don't want to play Dak.

Purchased along with A Victory Lost in Jan. '07 as my return to wargaming and it has suffered under AVL's shadow until now. (Oct. '07)
  This is a terrific game and is appropriate for those who like the complexity level of AVL.  But it's not AVL.

Both players roll 30d6. Who ever got more, wins. No need for anything more complicated to have same amount of decisions to do. Sure, you can move troops and make some nice maneuvers every now and then but in the end dices decide who will succeed. That CRT table should be an example of how not to do CRT table in war games because result depends way too much from dice roll. And even if you manage out-maneuver your opponent in open, the real killer comes when you hit your head against Tobruk defenses. I hope you feel lucky because luck defines how fast you can bypass that ridiculous city to either direction.

I expected more, a lot more from this game.

Nice, simple take on the North Arfrican theater of operations. Smooth and fast gameplay. Great sense for the logistical difficulties in the war. Just like all the titles in the SCS a bit too basic for my taste, but still enjoyable.

I don't feel I've played this enough to properly rate it yet, but from what I can see so far this is just about the perfect introduction into classic hex-and-counter wargaming. The rules are simple enough to teach to a complete wargaming newbie, yet they generate some tough decisions and are reasonably true to history. There are several small and interesting scenarios as well as longer ones and the full campaign. It's very reasonably priced. What's not to like?

Update: Gave it some more play and I have doubts about some of the scenarios. As written, some of them appear to be theoretically impossible for one side to win given competent play by the other. The designer is noted for favoring large campaigns over scenarios, and I suspect this is the result. However, I'm not quite confident enough in my assessment at this point to rate the game yet - I'd like to get in a couple of games against some veteran SCS players to see if I'm missing something.

I suck at this game so bad. As the Germans I can't even get to Tobruk. As the Allies I can't even get to Tobruk ;) but I suck at operational games in general. I still think the game is great.

It suffers a bit from being an old school hex and counter slugfest, in that one player's turn can take up to 30 minutes when more units get on the board, and the other guy might as well read a  book in the meantime because you shouldn't watch opponent's moves too closely because of the fog of war rules. Also with my playing speed (did I say I suck at operational games?) it's impossible to play the entire campaign over the weekend. A long scenario yes, but not the full game.

As a WWII gamer, I've always been more interested in the European and Pacific Theatres. When I decided to give the African campaign a try, I looked for a nice light introduction, and this is it! Afrika serves as a fun, fast, and friendly stepping stone into deeper WWII games.

Enjoyed playing this one on VASSAL, the ease of replacements, especially for the Commonwealth, makes this game feel a lot closer to a game of maneuver and counter-punching than say Columbia's Rommel in the Desert.

I highly recommend this game, the scenarios make it especially playable.

An outstanding game! I've been hooked on another SCS game (Ardennes) for some time. But this game is even better. It reminds me a lot of the old AH classic Afrika Korps. Highly recommend this one.

RATING: 7
It's always difficult to make a manageable game of a campaign so long as this one, and Afrika II achieves it on a fun and simple way.
On the other hand, luck is too much important, as a bad die-roll can destroy the best planned offensive.

Part of the Standard Combat Series (SCS) easy rules (8 pages for series rules and 2-4 for specific game rules) and we have played it. I really enjoyed it. I really like all the games in the SCS series but this one is the one I have played the most and think is very good representation of the series. Changed my rating to a 10 to off set the "1" trolls and because this game is #6 on my Top 10 in my BGG Profile

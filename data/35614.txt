What a wonderfully themed game. It can be a bit long and repetitive but this is more than made up for by the engaging narrative that it tells. My only problem is that I sort of want to lose badly so that the evil one gets seriously kicked out of office.

The fleet phase up until the San Carlos landing is fine. Then, the game appears to fall apart. I need to give this several more chances though, so I do expect my feeling about this title to improve.

Also, with a board this huge, I have trouble divining why certain elements need to be placed OFF-BOARD. Really?

Received 9/9/09. The components are outstanding. A large mounted map and nice, large counters.  Plays as well as it looks. 
 Two minor grips. I would like to see more of a color difference between the ground forces and I would have like to have had reinforcement turn of entry printed on the counters.  I've added them with a sharpie on the back and it makes setting up much easier.  
 As of 10/10/09, I've played through five complete games.  Lost all but one.  Still, a fantastic game!!

Juego en solitario que simula el avance de la marina inglesa hacia las islas Malvinas y los posteriores combates. El juego simula los combates aereonavales y terrestres. Las reglas no están redactadas en un orden comprensible. Cuesta mucho no perderse en ellas. Tiene un abuso de lanzamiento de dados y no proporciona una guíia clara de como se realiza el turno. Son esenciales las ayudas de juego que han hecho los aficionados para poder avanzar por el juego.

Mind-boggling production values. Some niggles, but genuinely addictive - has that "just one more turn...oh, midnight already?" effect.  Fine change in tempo over the course of a game as the tension builds and political events, weather and Argentine attacks take their toll.

Great real solo wargame. Theme and historical immersion is amazing. Some parts are a little too simplified (dice) but overall it keeps the game at the right level of interest and playability. The Events system is fantastic... decisions! Decisions! Decisions!
(Rulebook  organization is another alien mindset example)

Plus:
* The event cards adds spice and dilemmas to the game.
* The taskforce zone and their 8 protective zones are a nice aspect.
* Nice mapboard and counter design with individual British ships.
* Intelligent sequence-of-play.

Cons:
* The game is somewhat abstract. You do not see where the task forces are floating on the map compared to the Falklands.
* The June land war as a whole has been skipped, while the British then suffered severe problems.
* Argentina airplanes are numerous and you don't keep track how many planes have been shoot down. In game terms guiding away and shooting down are treated as the same, while I would like to know - for sake of the story - how many planes have been lost.
* Argentine surface forces are represented by task forces and not individual ships. Same remark as above.
* Argentine navy is being commanded in a somewhat simplistic manner.

RATING: 4
Many of the reviews above are true (quality of the components, tensions during play, etc.) but there are (much)  too many dice rolls and the organization of the chapters in the rules are a mess (though submarine warfare is the first combat action, it is described after air-to-air, surface-to-air and air-to-surface combat) and you have constantly to flip through the book until you know it by heart.

There are also some illogical results such as: Argentine ships which are sunk may result in a lower (UK) domestic opinion?? or Nimrods detection allows for Harriers scrambling to intercept coming raids, and then if the targeting zone is empty, surface ships can't launch any SAM against the raiding planes!?

In the end the sheer dice rolling mechanism make it less interesting that it should because strategy is thus very limited and most operations rely on randomness.

RATING: 8.5
This is one of the top 5 solitaire designs that I have tried so far. In my opinion, it is a fantastic design.

It recreates the tension of the advance of the British task force as it approaches southern Argentinian waters and the dreaded air attacks. I really enjoy managing the decision process around the defense of the TF: should I put Harriers in the air to preempt possible attacks? But where? And with this weather? And how about my ships? Where should I position the strongest ones? Should the TF stay put this round while we wait for the ships that went on this side mission to join back the formation? And the event cards that you turn on every round add to the uncertainty of the whole process, forcing you to adapt to a situation that is never fixed. 

I specially like the balancing act between advancing with the TF, defending your most precious vessels, while managing domestic and international public opinions. I think the designer has created a simple, yet brilliant way to integrate the tactical military and the political dimensions of the struggle.

The invasion of the Malvinas islands at the end of the game creates a second game that depicts the invasion in an almost abstract manner, but that is really engrossing and tense.

It is one of those games that makes you want to learn more about the conflict. I never imagined, even being a Brazilian (close to the conflict), that the British TF ran the risk of not getting the invasion through.

A great design. Hard to get in the market, but totally worth it!

RATING: 8
A good solitary game about a semi-obscure conflict, using many innovative ideas and a great mechanism for air to air and air to ground combat. Shares the common problem of solitaire games in that it is based on repeating the same sequence again and again, which can get boring after a while. The different event cards help keep it fresh from game to game though, and it provides plenty of tense moments. 

Good game, but unfortunately the theme isn't the most personally interesting.

RATING: 10
This is not a great game for the Falklands' conflict; there is no great game for the Falklands' campaign.  But it is still rather fetching and I am loath to part with it, while honestly wondering how much more I will play it.  

There needs to be a definitive design to cover the air, sea, ground and political wars.  This game tries to be that, and pulls off the air and sea action rather well.  The politics are skewed against the UK; some of those cards have to go before the game begins.  The ground aspect is abstracted beyond all hope; it is fun on its own, but reeks when compared to history.

--------------------------------------------------

A tentative ten (still) that stands on shaky ground:

1) This is a great quote from Matt Foster: "The sequence of play has more steps than does the assembly of a nuclear weapon, but at its core the game is not complex." :) This game is so laden down with procedures and die rolls, that you really want to have a group with you to take on some of these rules and rolls.  Every time you have to follow a step, it seems that tension is lost, not built.  I imagine, or hope, that this feeling will change as the game becomes more familiar so that a positive tension will build.

2) The rulebook is frequently praised for its clarity, but I find it chunky, wordy, and filled with holes that leave darkness where light is demanded.  

3) Along the way to three printings, neither the designer nor the publisher bothered to restructure the rulebook to match the sequence of play.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me.  Fool me three times meanst that I am a bloody idiot and you--the designer, the publisher--just take my money and laugh in my face. 

4) Charles Vasey is correct in his observation that there are too many negatives in the event cards.  Pull enough of the bad ones in a row and it is time to start the game all over again.  I understand how sinking an Argentine sub would affect world opinion, but to have it lower the British seems illogical.  Yes, the snooty Church of England can tut tut its way and turn its back on the Thatcher government, but since when has the Anglican Church ever been relevant in the lives of the majority of the British?  Perhaps in the 19th century, but not in 1982, and the feelings of some clergy surely do not reflect those of the average Brit, mythical though such a concept might be.

RATING: 7.75
Third printing - cost is high, but a very enjoyable game with good replay value. One big complaint: the third printing should NOT reproduce all the errors of the first printing! Computerized layout made corrections easy in the 1980's - no reason not to utilize the ability to fix things in 2013. Coupled with the high price, it's inexcusable. Drops the rating from a 9+ to something under 8.

Excellent game for building a narrative, the war unfolds before you.  Player choices can have minimal effect, or they can be crucial.  That disparity can be a little hard; the war gamer in me wants more control and more likelihood of laying awake at night thinking about "next time".  But I also enjoyed the ride, even when I wasn't exercising as much control as I'd like, just a somewhat different mindset.

I am enjoying the game overall - it really helps you to feel the stress and strain of projecting a joint force to the other end of the World with all of the friction, military and political, that then follows. 

I dislike the attempt to use  counters for the tactical combat sequences - this part of the game seems to be an afterthought and the combat steps are not described well in relation to the placing or removal of counters from the combat box in the rules. 

The other aspect is that different parts of the rules are needed during certain sequences of activity - specifically the search and early warnings that have separate rule sections are actually part of the Air combat sequence of events during play and it can be tricky to get everything in the right order. But it is all fairly intuitive if you are a moderately experienced gamer and the examples are pretty comprehensive.  

I am 10 turns into the game and I am enjoying it. The cat and mouse game with subs and task forces in particular is interesting if somewhat inconclusive - but remember the locations of ARG TF and Subs is where the Brits think they are. After 10 days I have lost HMS Alacrity to an Exocet and the Argies have lost a couple of Super Etendardes - so the war has started for real. A shame that ARG losses are not meaningfully tracked in any way - a loss is a equivalent to an abort/destroyed result and has no effect on play/victory.

It will be interesting to see how much more complex the game gets once Op SUTTON is activated - the Brit land operations phase - but overall this is a pleasing solo experience. I have played solo games where I have rolled a lot more dice.... (SASL anyone?)

I couldn´t enjoy this game. The rules are horrible. Not enough information on the counters: you constantly have to check tables and rules. 90 per cent of the game is simple mechanical practice: dice rolling, moving counters from one space to another, following the sequence of play, wich I was only able to do with a step by step player aid that you can find in the files section. There´s very little decision making, the game is really long. One of these solitaire desasters, where you just play a system.

As a avid reader on the 1982 Falklands War, this game is amazingly thematic and feels totally realistic in replicating the conflict, complete with tactical and political aspects. The rulebook makes it VERY HARD to learn the system (download the long sequence of play from BGG) and it's a LOT of dice rolling and not quite enough player choices, but even so it does a great job of building up the stress on the player and making them really appreciate the British success in the war. It really NEEDS new counters (with actual useful information on them) and a Manual reorganization pretty badly, but the game itself is solid.

I think this is a great game despite a (very) disorganized rulebook. Haven't pulled it out to play again after the initial plays due to the oversized board. The board is very beautiful but is all very large. I am unable to reach the top of the board while seated and so played this game standing over my gaming table which was not very comfortable. If there was a shrunken board to use (even a paper one) I think I certainly would play this again.

On the way (10/13) from Noble Knight Games!  Really looking forward to this one.  Curious to see how it plays out and how it simulates modern naval combat as compared to other games like The Fleet Series or Harpoon.

Arrived today!  I will get it on the table this weekend! :cool:

I did get in on the table this weekend and I enjoyed it immensely!  This game does for modern naval combat what Carrier does for WWII Pacific carrier warfare.  Rules are clear and very detailed to help with misconceptions.  Game can be played right out of the box as you can incorporate new rules as needed.  This will make for mistakes on the first play, but that's what the first play is all about anyway, right? :)  This could very easily jump into my top ten games with a few more plays!

So far, not so good! :gulp:  Argentina 3, UK 0!!  :shake: :angry: :what:  Maggie would be so disappointed in me! :gulp: :thumbsdown:  
Got my first win finally! :cool: Had some success recently with some tense, nailbiter games (I only secured the last three zones for a seven zone victory on the last turn of the most recent play! :wow: ) So score now updated, but still behind.  Argentina :d10-1: :d10-2: UK :d10-1: :d10-0:

As someone who serverd in the Falklands all I can say is that during my first play I had goosebumps. The game is an extraordinary effort that manages to capture a remarkable narrative! This is the first game on the Falkland conflict that has managed to capture any of the issues that the British & Argentine military had to deal with.If any of you are on the fence now is the time to come on down and play an extraordinary game.

Components most impressive. But the ergonomics seem strangely unconsidered. Some areas of simulation (like missiles) consume vast quantities of time others (surface action) are abstracted in a trice. The land warfare bit is not very believable and appears to have been tacked on. The Army pinned on the beaches? I don't think so. The event cards are defeatist in tone lacking the ups but having plenty of the downs. The result is that it does not feel like the real thing as much as it might.

The game has a great sense of personal vision.

A massive footprint and some serious 'weight' to this solitaire game on Operation Corporate, which sees you deploying assets and reacting to world events as the Task Force nears the Falklands. You need to juggle public opinion, speed of advance and losses, fighting off the flighty Argentine Navy and dealing with a successsion of air strikes (including the dreaded Exocet) until you get to launch the landings. As a solitaire game there is a lot of die rolling and chart look ups, but the systems are pretty easy to grasp, and generate a fair amount of tension as raids find weak spots and ships are sent to the bottom. The landings themselves are a tad simplistic, but again the tension is high, as all your hard work defending the task force may come to nowt if you cannot land enough troops and generate enough support to win those crucial landing zones. The events are a little 'hyper' (just about everything that was rumoured may come to pass here), but it really helps the narrative. Probably did not need the monster treatment, but it is an excellent piece of work which will give you some truly arse-clenching situations along the way. Not easy either - I got a hell of a lot of luck on the air strikes, but still only managed a Stalement because my landings were a fair old disaster.

The quality of the components are incredible! I almost shit myself when I unpacked this behemoth of a box. It is bloody heavy! You get two GIANT mounted maps, a heavy and richly produced full color rulebook, an intelligence booklet, a deck of cards, some player aides, a crap load of dice, and nice thick 1" counters. The counters are not quite euro game thickness, but thicker than your typical wargame. They are very nice!

I have mixed feelings regarding this game.

Negatives - the board is too large and requires excessive stretching; the rules are illogically organized; too much dice rolling; the two map sections have a mismatch regarding colours.

Positives - very attractive components; rules clearly worded (even though poorly sorted).

Not a bad game at all - it certainly creates a level of stress and tension that is rare to find in games.  I like the idea of managing your task force and your CAP.  The event cards add an interesting flavor and give you some additional options that further adds tension because so many of the choices are borderline.  The attack and defense mechanics are simple but well defined.  While I found the combat fun overall, I did find the dice rolling to be a bit much at times, like during ground combat.  I also found that my CAP screens were largely ineffective against enemy fighter/bombers, but the enemy was largely ineffective at bombing.  Due to recovery rolls, almost all of my CAP fighters losses were due to them trying to land.  However, the Exocets were largely effective.  The game takes a while to play out, particularly during the landing phase when you have up to 5 waves of enemy planes to resolve, but it is an enjoyable experience overall.

I managed to preorder and buy a copy of the third printing. How glad I am that I did. This is one of the best solitaire games I have ever played. It is a long game, but the rules are straightforward and procedural, the decisions are difficult and the outcomes can be heart-rendering. The board is very large which, together with game length, might mean it doesn't come out as often as I would like, but I can't really mark it down because of that. The game is fantastic!
Based on my single play so far, I have no hesitation in giving this a rating of 10.

Played once.  As solitaire games go, there's a lot more player decision-making here than in something like B-17, but it's still at heart a dice-rolling exercise.  The rules are mostly quite good, although why they aren't in Sequence of Play order is baffling (in fact, some rules are written in the exact *opposite* of play order).  And the physical components, while very nice looking, are an ergonomic trainwreck of epic proportions -- possibly the worst that I've encountered in 30+ years of wargaming.  It's almost as though they intentionally wanted to make the game extra-difficult to play!  Fortunately the system is simple enough that the awful components aren't a gamebreaker.

I am not an expert on the war, but the sense I get is that the game is skewed heavily toward the Argentines (in comparison to the actual conflict) in order to be challenging for the player. It's more game than history, but I'm OK with that.

Once one gets the hang of things, the game plays very quickly.  If not for that, I would rate it lower.  But it'll hit my table again.

As a tie-in, check out the excellent Argentine film BLESSED BY FIRE.

Jesus wept. That was the feeling I got when I opened the box of WTiD, and not in a good way either. You see,it had the misfortune of arriving on the same day as a game, also preordered, from a large and well-known company in the US. That game had good components and a well-written rulebook that was clear and concise and used standard terminology. 

But let's look at WTiD, shall we? 

The box is big. Really big. It contains a lot of stuff. However, it also contains a lot of empty space - the universe is also enormous but it too contains a lot of nothing. Two giant boards, which could be condensed into a single 22"x34" quite easily, a couple of sheets of fairly underwhelming counters and more manuals and sheets than I can shake a small rainforest at. 

Usually this would be a Good Thing.

The box was damaged, yet the postal box was not. This had, therefore, occurred *prior* to packaging in the printers. However I'm not Poirot and in the great scheme of things this is a triviality. And then I remembered that I'd paid nigh-on £100 for it and I felt my heart sink. 

The boards are ludicrously, unfathomably huge and yet are mostly just dead space. If you're trying to convey ocean vastness, destroying forests is not the best way to achieve this. Individual counters for the weather rather than an on-board chart - really? The counters are fairly cheap and tatty, the images on the boards were poorly reproduced and low-res and the rulebook.... well. Let's just say that the rules do a damn good job of simulating the misery of a voyage to the South Atlantic (trust me).

As a game, I can't really comment. It's a sophisticated version of Ludo/Parchesi. There's a *lot* of dice rolling and referring to interminable charts. I felt that this is how it must have been to bystanders of the war at the time, watching someone else's struggles play out a long way away - in my case, about 3 feet away on the other side of the boards. Did I mention that they are huge? 
Then I arrange my air cover picquets for tomorrow, decide whether to spend the day sailing in a big circle or move closer the Falklands, and try to push the feelings of utter pointlessness to the back of my mind.

I gather that Fifth Column Games had problems with this (the 3rd printing). 
That's not really my problem, however. I also gather that there were problems with trying to get this out alongside a run of Codeword Cromwell. Again, that's not really my problem. Small companies have to work harder than big companies, that's how small companies become big ones. I also accept that the owner does not do this fulltime. The above applies to that too.

I can accept but not forgive the appalling lack of customer service and communication to customers during the epic saga of the 3rd reprinting of this game. I'm a tolerant, understanding sort but this tested me to the limits with Fifth Column. Never, ever again will I buy from this company, despite initially being interested in Cromwell.

This might sound like a review of the company rather than the game, and for that I apologise. However the game is a second-rate exercise in dice-rolling, damned further by being ridiculously overpriced and the delays in getting to the printers.

Hit or miss? Miss, most definitely. Miss, into the vast emptiness of the lusty ocean swells. Did I tell you that the boards are big?

Solitaire game where the player is trying to retake the Falkland Islands in May, 1982.  Interesting game, with the player representing the British trying to get their task force to the Falklands, while beating off the Argentine air and naval strikes.  The game system is very procedural, with a ton of die rolling (start strengthening your wrist now!), and a 50 step sequence of play!  However, once you have played a few turns it rapidly becomes familiar, and the game play is quite engrossing despite the dice fest.  The game is presented very well, and the rulebook is excellent.  The map is about twice as large as it needs to be, making it a pain to reach across to the turn record track, and an extra aid or two summarising the die rolls would have been nice, rather than thumbing back through the rules.  Other than that, nice game.

However, a full refund was provided, so fair play to Dan.

Well-designed and beautiful solitaire game on the South Atlantic War--not easy for the player to win against the Argentinians.  If anything, this game is an eye-opener about the Falklands/Malivinas War and how easy it could have gone wrong for the UK.

RATING: 9
Excellent game - very good game system, and excellent production values. 
Have played several times in a row, immediately setting up a new game after finishing a previous one, so highly-replayable and fun.
Why a '9' not a '10'? Could do with a bit moreproof reading, the map is actually larger than it needs to be, the use of contrasting colours on some of the counters would improve things (for example to more clearly distinguish British and Argentine ground troops), and (a common issue with solo games) it occassionally feels like you win or lose due to luck, rather than player choice (though less so than any other solo game I've played)
This review mid-way through 5th game, so I may yet revise my rating.

RATING: 5
First impressions:

Long. 
Pretty. 
High die roll to decision ratio. 
Refers to 2d6 as D12, and 1d12 as 1d12. Unforgivable. 
Endgame is a disaster. I have no idea how to invade. I don't know WHY I need to invade the beachheads. The game is mostly a prologue to this terrible, anticlimactic moment.

This seamlessly weaves miltary and political events into a hugely compelling narrative starting slowly (and when things are slow turns are over quickly) building into a crescendo of tension and difficult decisions. 

As a rampant anti-Thatcherite I'd like to respond to someone else's critisism that to do well you support Thatcher - not true. Doing well reflects the effects on the British people and I think the creator got it spot on. Besides if I only enjoyed games where my good-guys triumphed I'd have very thin gruel... the Russian front in WW2 would be unplayable!

Tip: When reading teh rules YOU MUST do so by following the sequence of play chart otherwise it will be hard to follow...  it took me a while to play my first 
game because I didn't realise this.

Best solo game I've ever played by a county mile.

RATING: 7.5
One thing that really jumps out at me is the way that game offers a fantastic sense of tension on a almost continuous basis. Outside really bad weather, you rarely get a breather or respite from the Argentinean forces, and you're racing both time and the inevitable deterioration of international and domestic opinion of the overall war effort. 

The game has a great sense of flavor and chrome for the conflict without it bogging down the rules much at all. Only the Exocets really are treated differently, and it seems appropriate that the big threat get its own set of rules for its harrowing approach that makes each roll feel like the page out of a good modern war thriller.

The rulebook is well written and the precise, annotated sequence of play keeps you on track perfectly, even in the first play through. The turns move briskly, even when there is both naval and air attacks to be resolved, so you don't ever feel like the game is bogged down as you approach the crescendo of the landings.

Others have gushed about the components quality and artwork, and yes they are right, but game design here is every bit its equal. Captivating and engrossing, WITD does all the things a good solitaire wargame should-tell a strong narrative, give you plenty of meaningful choices to make each turn (but not too many, this is still a light-medium war game), and provides thrill and tension with every die roll. 

Edit: Lowered to 7.5 after three plays- replayability takes a hit due to way that some very effective early to mid game strategies play out regardless of what is actually happening on the board. Still a great game, just could use some more things that would cause you to rethink the next few turns' strategies, such as event cards with more drastic outcomes.

Wow, wow.  What an amazingly designed and produced game.  It is big and attractive.  Most small publishers go on the safe side for a first game.  Kudos for going all out on this one.  Finally a solitaire war game with narrative.  I truly feel like I'm commanding the task force.  The rules look daunting, but are very procedural (a plus for me).  I'm really glad I got a copy of this when I could.

RATING: 10
Absolutely awesome wargame.  One of the best I've ever played.  Solitaire that covers almost all aspect of the British invasion of the Falklands.  The game is tense and full of tactical and strategic options, such that it doesn't feel like the game is taking you for a ride.  There is a lot happening all the time.  Even though a game can take 6-10 hours, when I am finished... I always wish it was longer!  Its a very good sign!  (Seriously, its very well paced and perfect in its length... ) 

As the icing on the cake, the production value is AMAZING!  Rivals the best Eurogames in that arena.  The map is huge and the counters are possibly the best counters of any wargame to date.  

Only downside is its limited production run and that means its a bit of a collectible game and priced accordingly....  I hope to hell no one is just leaving this one on the shelf... its really worth playing.  

Simply Sublime.

RATING: 10
A wonderful solitaire game. The medium rating is because, as the designer says, it's a game, not a simulation. The rules are detailed, and take a bit of reading. Once you start play, you should use the S.21.0 Sequence of Play to ensure you do NOT miss any steps. This is doubly important as the rule book does NOT explain rules in SoP order, but in a build-up fashion so that you can make intelligent choices at appropriate points. 

The game takes some luck, but good decisions should win out.

A few variant rules suggest themselves: (i)on May 25th "Ignore first Stand Down result" to ensure max effort on that day; (ii) -1 Scramble modifier per day sorties not flown (cumulative) to ensure you do not get lop-sided campaigns. My original campaign I had 7 FAA Air attacks, and 8 ARA Naval attacks. Ooops. 

Looking forward to setting this up and playing again. And again.

RATING: 9
Very interesting solitaire game that covers the Falklands War in a very dynamic style of wargaming.  Lots of dice rolling, but little effect.  Accurately reflects the lack of desire for a full blown war by both sides.  Very challenging but doesn't feel difficult to understand the mechanics, and so the focus remains on the strategy.  

Difficult to play well the first time, but felt like it should have been.  Repeated plays keep things very interesting and once again, despite some of the wristage, the game forces stressful and important decisions at every turn.

This game starts very slowly only usually to end in a climatic end.

Beautifull an thematically unique game. Played it quite often (6 times) but the last time it felt quite repetetive, too many dice-rolls especially during the somehow anticlactic final landig operation itself. No need to play it again.

RATING: 8
A very fine game. Rules are very complete, the components are top-notch. Replayability is very good because of the many decisions but after some plays predictable. Game play is very easy once you understand the mechanics. Objections are very minor: the game board is really big. For people with a height challenge this can be an issue. The distinction between the British and Argentine land troops could be better. The land war is too abstract. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 3 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 2 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

Complaint #1: no description of the counters making the initial punching/first setup extraordinarily confusing. "Place British units on troop carriers" is confusing when you don't even know what a British unit looks like. This also means you are left to guess/deduce what the numbers on the back of certain counters mean.

Complaint #2: the rules don't follow the sequence of play, for no reason that I can understand. This means a lot of flipping back and forth as you progress through a turn.

Complaint #3: the game would require much less manual checking if the sequence of play included a shorthand of the dice involved for each check. For instance, it just says, "B. Weather" when it could say "B. Weather D12". I found that at least 50% of my rules checking in plays was to verify I was rolling the right dice. Sure, this goes down with experience but it means when you put the game away and come back to it 6 weeks later you still have to refer to rule book for all of those numbers.

Complaint #4: If you do well you support Margaret Thatcher.

Praise #1: Excellent production details (especially for a self-published game) that makes it even harder for me to consider purchasing Columbia/GMT/traditional wargames. Mounted boards, nice art, not a ton of rules errata.

Praise #2: Thank god for a wargame that tries something slightly different: not more WW2.

This was my second foray into solo wargaming. I've come to the conclusion that it is just not something that works for me. This is a 3-4 hour game and it feels like if you had a computer doing the boring book keeping for you it'd only be 30 minutes long. I'd rather just play a more-detailed and faster-playing computer game if I'm going to be solo gaming.

The air-naval game is very good. The amphibious landing part of the game I found disappointing--specifically the certainty that there will be Argentine units defending some of the San Carlos beaches by the earliest possible May 21 landing date (which the Argentines actually did not defend!). A different mechanic that gives some more uncertainty/suspense about the Argentine presence/strength in San Carlos would make the game better. Maybe the option to land earlier than May 21st as well. I don't see a reason not to turn a Sitrep card over every turn as you want to get to San Carlos and land before the Argentines are too strong. Given the number of delaying events it seems like a "no brainer" to advance the task force whenever you get the chance.

One of best solitaire games I have played. Situation is interesting, theme very strong, visual presentation outstanding. Game is not taking too long to finish.

There are few small caveats though - some components could be more usable. Eg. hit numbers could be on front of counter. Second gripe is that there is really lot of rolling, however it is pretty common in solitaire games.

Still I like it very much.

Seems to be a serious study on the War of Falkland...but does it worth it?  The scale of the war seems to be rather limited...but then the modern technology may have resolved the conflict quickly.  On the other hand, it seems to me at the time that both sides' morale were low for a fighting over this tiny island.  And you wonder why, as a former colonial citizen, that the Brits would fight a war with Argentina over an island thousand miles away with few inhabitants while they would give up Hong Kong where 6 millions people was living...there must be a reason behind this war.

Solo play game about managing the british campaign to retake the Falklands in 1982 - Looks very interesting! 

The Falklands war has always fascinated me, partly because it is the first conflict I was old enough to remember and understand.

Single Player Game with very nice historical feeling of the aeronaval battle for the Falklands from first blood to the San Carlos Bay landing.

Played 8 times, won 4 times, lost twice and had two stalemate result... and a lot of fun !!

First game: 10 British ships were lost by May 25th, among which the Fearless. The public opinion could not bear more.
Second game: succeded to land 6 regiments for a short British victory. I almost lost the game on May 21st when both the Intrepid and the St Edmund with all the Tanks of Blues and Royal were sunk before disambarking !
Third game: public opinion collapsed after some bad political choices and lots of ships sunk
Fourth game: STALEMATE. Everything was going well, public and international opinion remained high throughout the game, Argentinian fleet lost 4 units and was nowhere to be seen, Argentinian supply of the Falklands collapsed after the first fight. BUT the Argentinian managed to send reinforcements to San Carlos before my landings and only half the British succeded to hold ground after difficult landings.
5th game: 6 landings but at the loss of a support ship STALEMATE
6th game: 6 landings for a narrow victory but DOM=2
7th game: MAJOR VICTORY with 8 landings and INT and DOM opinion at 1. Very hot finish
8th game: clear British victory with 7 landings. 5 exocets were met by British countermeasures and none scored a hit. Finished with DOM=5! Biggest loss was a Canberra hitting a filled troop transport a week before landing.

I was expecting more ... the hype around this game let me down quite a bit. The game is beautiful but has a footprint that's _way_ too big. The rules are very confusing and not very consistent (2d6 vs D12 vs d12 etc). And finally, the game itself is not very interesting. It felt like a deluxe 'State of Siege' game where all you have to do watch out for are the two political tracks.

A Grail War Game for me. The theme was fascinating and whilst there's a lot of dice rolling in this one, it's fairly even to manage. The game uses (and comes with!) many different dice to use in order to have a wide range of odds instead of using combat tables too excessively. Huge components and the map boards take the whole table, but I had fun playing this one. The second half of the campaign is very action heavy and everything ramps up.

[disclaimer : only two games so far ]

Gorgeous components and original theme, clever mechanisms that you can learn easily despite the less than optimal rulebook. However, I regret that the counters show so few data (and you have to flip them to access) for their size, that there are so much markers where some tracks on the (giant) board would have been enough, that neither the rulebook nor the board organization follow the turn sequence, and that you roll so much dice for so few events really happening. I admit you can follow the events unfolding more closely this way, but the game is a bit long for what there is to decide.
Also, I suspect there's not that much replayability despite the event cards and luck factor. I hope to be wrong and am willing to play again as soon as possible; and I hope I will enhance the rating!

I don't like the sit-rep cards (tiny red on blue lettering? No thanks!) Big and bold numbers, please.

Similarly, the weather chits are of little value, as you still need to look through the rulebook to find out what effects they have.`

Edit: forgot to look on the back! All the stuff you need is on the reverse of the weather chits...

Apart from that, an interesting simulation combining both military and political decisions.

RATING: 4
This rating more reflects my dislike of the genre than this game. It is rules intensive, no matter the designer's claims. Throughout I was continually referencing them and flicking backwards and forwards to ensure I was playing right, and this continual worry ripped me out of any possible theme immersion. I just don't understand why these rules weren't presented in a flowchart manner so I could follow them logically through a turn, especially when it's a solo game. Anyway, a lot of those rules processes usually resulted in nothing happening, forcing me to go through the motions in case a 1 in 60 shot happens. That's not my idea of a fun time. To the game itself, I array my fleet, I choose which zones to place my air and sub defenses, and then resolve die after die after die of seeing whether the Argentine subs/ships/planes deploy, where, whether an intercept happens, etc, all for a possible 1 in 10 shot at destroying something. Meaning nothing usually happens. Roll for weather, resolve an event card, repeat for 20+ turns. I didn't feel I was doing anything particularly clever - making sensible choices on events and playing the odds elsewhere, rolling/watching it play out. This repetitive process takes far too long to be enjoyable - unless you're into that kind of simulation and have the time and inclination. In the meantime, while I may have improved my knowledge of the situation as it was, this game didn't make me care any further on the hows and whys of it resolving as it did.

This game is amazing. If only it didn't take a whole day to play. The decisions are frequently gut wrenching, and watching a gamble turn into a success is unlike anything I've felt from other games.

The best solitaire game I ever played. Retains some of the idiosyncrasies common to this kind of game (repeated dice-rolling procedures...): not a fault, really, but not entirely satisfactory to me, hence rating down 1 notch. Still a grand experience.

This is high on my wish list, but at 46 pounds stirling postage to NZ, this is probably not going to see the light of day on my table.

Purchased this used at an amazing price. Perfect condition with one slight problem: this copy didn't come with counters. The store, however, has provided full color copies of the counters that should have been included. Hopefully I can get Office Max to mount them properly, and the game will be fully playable.

Incredible experience. You feel the losses, and celebrate the victories. Never have I felt such a combination of highs and lows in a single game before, other than perhaps BSG.
Yes, there is a lot of dice rolling, yes, there is a lot of rules referencing, but the experience is well worth it.

One of the largest, best produced and most intense solo-game experiences I've had. I really should get this out onto the table more often. And I really should also re-visit my ideas and notes in making this a co-operative team game as well.

RATING: 3
The "MYTH" of Falklands War games. This could have been a great game. Instead, we get what amounts to a fictional thriller novel based loosely on the Falklands War, overloaded with ahistorical random events (each of which should happen two thirds of the time if you play it). An entire para regiment sent off to Ireland at the last minute; a 1/10 chance of EVERY BRITISH NAVAL REINFORCEMENT being blown up by Argentine terrorists at Gibraltar; Soviet planes being downed accidentally... that sort of thing. Once you get all the way to the end, past the ill-defined Argentine navy which has already lost the General Belgrano before the game begins (no drama there), you get to land on (historically) undefended San Carlos. Except there seems to be a lot of opposition on the ground in this sci-fi universe. But if you do achieve a historical victory and land unopposed, then the rules tell you that Margaret Thatcher will reign over the UK for decades and conquer the Argentine mainland. Or something like that. Oh yes -- you DON'T EVEN GET TO FIGHT THE GROUND WAR! The game is missing half the naval/air war and nearly all the ground war. What's the point of that? A bizarre game with gorgeous components, but there is no reason to take it seriously as a historical simulation if it even works as a game. The only reason I still own this game is I collect Falklands games! This is absolutely dire.

Great solo wargame - beautiful graphics, excellent components, good gaming system, nice historical touch with the event cards and, above all, it really really manages to build up the tension as you play! Bit of a dicefest though, but in a good way. Not quite a 10 because of the (IMO) somewhat counter-intuitive depiction of the land campaign.

Yes very good indeed. It has taken me years to acquire this game after missing the boat (no pun intended) twice when it was released. Is it worth it? Yes it is. I've never seen a game that allows you to gain a feel of the whole war, political as well as military. It's a great nerve biting experience. However as the second play I got very luck and got the 2nd best victory, I'm not sure I want to play it again soon. I will await Cromwell with bated breath...

Pretty good, but the rules of play are a mess, the components weirdly huge, and its expensive for what it is (but Pretty Good !),

RATING: 9.5
Right now the only thing keeping this game from being a ten is that I don't know how the replayability will hold up.  I have high expectations, though.

Beautiful production values, gripping and surprisingly simple gameplay, and more tension than I thought a low-intensity conflict could ever manage.  The rulebook could use a little bit of a reorganization, but after a few hours, you barely need to look at it anymore.

This is a masterpiece.  If you don't have a copy, sorry, but you're not getting mine.  This game and I are friends for life.

While some of the best times I've ever had have been ftf gaming, it's just too hard to find and arrange on anything close to a regular basis.  So I'm mostly a solitaire gamer anymore (and I'm okay with that!).  This game covers a great subject and has great play and great tension.  One nit - the ground war aspect is rather weak, both in it's play and historical accuracy.  Maybe an expansion?   

Update - reduced rating to a 9.  After a whirlwind spell, this game went off the table, and now I'm uncertain when it'll get back on.  It's almost like I "conquered" the game (though my most fun session was a squeaker that I lost) and now the challenge is diminished.

RATING: 4
Eight turns played, as cooperative game with two. First impressions are quite OK, but there's a lot of dice-rolling. After few turns our play went faster but unfortunately we had to stop before any troops landed on the islands.
Some criticism: the board is way too big, there are colour-differences between both boards and the resolution of the (google-earth?) picture of Argentina is too low.

RATING: 8
The first single player board game that I owned and I am very impressed. The system is very elegant. The rules leave a little to be desired. The production value is extremely high, although I fear the board may be easily damaged on the folds. I wish it was not quite as long to play. 3 hours would be good but this seems to take much longer.

There's a lot to like about this game, and it's really hard!  I still haven't even gotten past the 24th turn.

RATING: 7.5
Everything that people are saying is accurate

1) Fantastic Components
2) Compelling Narrative
3) Big board with lots of wasted space and some questionable graphics decisions (that are still gorgeous)
4) Much more of a game than simulation (feels like the Argentinians got a bit of a boost)
5) Muddled rules
6) Landings feel tacked on

I am not sure about replayabilty - that will have to be determined.

Value for the money - honestly, not there.  If this game was 1/2 the cost, it would be great - but at nearly  $120 - think there are better uses for my money.

Likely will play this a couple of more times and then sell it.

A huge and successful endeavor to recreate both the military and political tension of the Falklands Islands conflict. This is an operational level solo game so don't be looking to land your troops and fight with them in tactical combat. The rules can be a bit of a slog but the game and components are excellent. Certainly a game for the solo enthusiast.

Play action generates the most exciting AAR narratives I've read, most all of which are plausibly real. Perhaps the greatest solitaire wargame ever. Certainly the greatest solitaire wargame I've observed at any length. Worth every penny. Playable via Vassal and Zun-Tzu, too, so set up is both quick and easy.

A well constructed game that offers plenty of variability from game to game.  A significant element of luck involved, particularly with respect to air strikes on the fleet.

Huge, heavy, quality components. Game looks beautiful - but was it all made too big? Does the map need to be so huge? This game will see less play on my table simply because I'll have to clear so much space than for most games, especially solo games...

Another CLASSIC solo game design and a must for solo war gamers. Takes some time to play but a rich experience with enough variability through event cards to keep you coming back for more. Beautiful graphics though as others have said the game board is a bit to big. Chits, rules, cards, map... incredible production value. Glad I snagged a cop[y - very pricey now. If you get the chance snag a copy - worth it. Only complaint is that the ground combat portion of the game is very abstract so the game really focuses on the build up to the ground operations. Game would have been much better in my opinion if there had been more time developing a more engaging ground component. but that is minor really... overall the game shines.

RATING: 8.5
At first, learning is a bit choppy, but once you get the flow down, the play is rather smooth.  The player has the many choices - allocation of forces, progress of the task force, etc.  This game does a great job simulating the macro level view of the conflict.

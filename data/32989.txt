RATING: 10
This doesn't get a lot of playtime because of how long it is, but what a great game.  The what-if decision tree through each player's command deck creates so much replayability (never mind the results on the diplomatic tables), something is bound to happen you haven't seen before.

Maybe this TK2 could be the best ETO WW2 game: it looks like all the main aspects of the war (blitzkrieg, politics & diplomacy, subs & convoys, air & naval support, weather, what ifs, etc etc) are in the game, but avoiding unecessary chrome and complications. 
The game is not card driven à la PoG, but the addition of cards is an elegant way to depict the main events of the Second World War.

RATING: N/A
Tried a historical play-through, using the listing of historical card plays.  Went pretty well until the shooting started.  Germans failed to take all the Polish cities on the first turn, so it drug out for three, putting a real crimp in their schedule.

Invasion of Norway required a total handwave; I think the posted solutions, in addition to being unrealistic, don't actually work if you read the rules carefully.  Some other naval rules don't seem right - can't wait to see what they do in the expansion kit, if it ever comes out.

At any rate, the Germans were too far behind schedule to launch the invasion of the West at the historical date, so I retired the game.  Learning how to overrun Poland on schedule might make the historical outcome possible.

Not rating this until I have some more play time in.  The cards didn't do much for me.  Eager to try the Eastern Front, but probably won't play again until the expansion kit comes out (or I give up on ever getting it).

This playable monster has wonderful graphics and interesting historical variety. As the Western Allies for example you can choose to modernize the French military rather than build the Maginot Line. The minor countries can join either side as political machinations develop. The event cards add excellent variety. My initial impression is strongly positive.

PDF rules are now available online, thankfully!
---
Been slogging through learning TK! via the Fire in the East one-map campaign. I'm finding TK! a lot easier to handle than Dai Senso!. The support unit rules (Air Forces, Fleets, CV Fleets, etc) are abstract and I found the rulebook explanations more or less incomprehensible, which is a problem given how key they are to DS!. They're not *that* hard, but moving around ground units and bashing stuff is, for me, more intuitive.

On the one hand, it actually plays pretty cleanly. The unit density is not that bad - not as bad as (A)3R, I think - and the Blitz markers, HQs, Air Forces tend to focus the action. Movement and combat is straightforward and works well, if you can figure out the HQ rules (yet another murky rules section). You can actually get a pretty good rhythm going during offensives.

Unfortunately, I found that there was still too much detail and micromanagement. 3 summer turns cover the big offensives and get a lot of action, but then there are 6 more off-season turns, two mud, two snow, in which a lot less goes on, either because of weather or because your option card is limiting. You have to do a bunch of counter-fiddling (like moving your replacements steps hex-by-hex to the front lines and destination units due to lack of sensible strategic movement rules) which saps a lot of the game's energy, especially early when neither side has any winter combat power and the off turns involve a lot of sitting and staring. Not terrible, but when compared to how tight Europe Engulfed, EastFront, or No Retreat! are - all of which have much better pacing during the less-active seasons - it's not awesome. Marching your replacements step by step to the front was a bridge too far for me.

Another downside is that in order to get the real mileage out of the cards - to see some of the cool hypothetical stuff - you really need to start in '37 or '39. That's a monster game; there is no end but the bitter end 40+ hours later (or so I'm told). Once you hit total war - which means Barbarossa in the historical flow - the card plays seem fairly constrained.

But ... on balance, I like it so far. All these ETO games that give you real strategic leeway have issues. A3R, AWAW, and WiF are all notoriously problematic, with monstrous playing times, horrendous complexity, and dubious abstractions. TK! feels much cleaner, more playable, and with better abstractions. To the extent that you can apply "clean" to an ETO game anyway - everyone gets mired in political rules. I can see myself playing this. Bits of it are unfortunately messy, but a lot of it seems quite effective also.

If you have sense at all, start playing this with '42 or '43 scenarios and work your way backwards. Playing your first big game by starting in '39 or even '37 is a recipe for frustration. Like most of these games there are little tactical tricks to it, and the only way to learn is to get into it and play something meaty - the short learning scenarios are not enough to prepare you. Starting in '39, when the Allies have no firepower and the Germans are just beating people up for two years, is not fun and only the Germans get to do anything until they completely hose the '41 invasion of Russia and concede. Even EE I only ever start in '41 anymore. The whole shooting match is a really fascinating scenario, but don't play it first, at least not if you're at all serious about the game.

RATING: 10
The rulebook can make the game appear more complex than it is.  The actual gameplay is very straightforward and I find the rulebook to be very clear and without ambiguities.  Quite an achievement for all that this game does.

The game allows you to play from 1937 to the end of World War 2.  The game does an excellent job of allowing you freedom of strategy while keeping you within the constraints of the politics of the time.  There is enough variability to provide a large amount of replayability.

Axis Empires Totaler Krieg is the best world war 2 grand strategy game I have played and one of my top 5 games period.  It's sister Dai Senso is absolutely fantastic as well.

This hits the sweet spot for grand strategy detail for me.

I strongly recommended this to anyone who likes grand strategy.  If you play the grand campaign, be prepared for a glorious 50 hours of gaming.

At it's core, a fairly straightforward hex and counter grand strategic ETO wargame. Under the hood, however, are some unique ways of dealing with things (such as supply and unit management) as well as allowing for a very wide range of outcomes with accessible but fairly chrome-laden special rules. Most chrome, however, comes out in the use of Option Cards that allow, for example, the Germans to try to have Switzerland politically ceded to them, much as they did historically with Austria and Czechoslovakia. I am in the process of learning the system via the three training scenarios (solitaire) after which I'll give one or both of the one-map campaign games a shot. At that point I'll know whether or not this can be my grand strategic ETO game or not (although I will probably need an opponent at that point). Also, probably will become a game I play via VASSAL, although the components in this edition are superior to previous editions (and about par for the course for "major" wargame publishers).

Parecia dificil, pero se ha mejorado la versión 1. 
El camino hacia la guerra es rápido de jugar y le da un toque de imprevisibilidad muy emocionante.
Se ha recortado la capacidad de respuesta de los aviones (algo lógico).
Lo único que no me gusta siguen siendo las tiradas de Delay.

I've enjoyed this game immensely since its release. There is a bit of a learning curve, but once the basics are down the game flows very well. The scale is one I enjoy for strategic games. Despite the size, there aren't too many counters on the map at one time. The map hexes are also sized well and reduces concern about 'counter clutter'. Replayability is excellent.

I liked proposition of game involving politics and starting prior WWII. It seemed really interesting. Unfortunately it is unplayable monster for me. Short scenarios are too small and basic and long ones are unplayable to me. 

But most importantly rulebook for this game is written in way it is really difficult to decode it. They have tried to make it shorter but end result for me is that it is in strange rules-lawyerish language which is really hard to read and generally I am not put away by more complex games automatically.

Also even if it can make sense from showing historical results I do not like concept of Fleets and Air units converted to beachhead markers and such. Also I do not like overrun mechanics where even stronger 1 step unit can be easily overrun. Again maybe it does work historically it creates strange flow of game for me. 

So I wanted to like this game very very much but it failed for me considerably. Thus my rating of 3. 

Now I will focus on learning A World at War game - which has rulebook much longer but much more readeable for me.

I will also try to learn more about Unconditional Surrender.

rules are difficult to understand. no index and no cross referencing means you must understand them completly before playing.

I would rank TK third in the Great Euro War games after World in Flames and A World at War. And Dai Senso is a poorly-designed add-on that gives no feel for the pacific war.

Although I have the DG 1st edition of the game, I need this game to link with Dai Senso for a monster WW2 all-inclusive game!! Hope that they would update the map graphics and card art as the DG first edition was a little bit drab. The system, not for the feint of heart!

This is a game that puts WWII into a blender and run it for 5 min. The overall flavor is still WWII but the war can progress wildly. It handles the chromes in an elegant way, which requires less rule checking. The length of the rule book seems daunting, but after play the two learning scenario, it will become very intuitive.

Regarding to game play, at beginning, I feel it is too random, but then I realize some of the card can actually compensate the randomness. If you got some bad political die roll, the negative effect of some cards will disappear.

So overall, a very nice and playable monster war game.

I am a huge TK! aficionado. It is the best strategic WWII game I've played, hands down. Great atmosphere, lots of interesting strategic pathways, less than total player control. This might well be my desert island game.

Dieses Monstergame für zwei Spieler simuliert den europäischen (und afrikanischen) Teil des Zweiten Weltkrieges auf strategischer Ebene. Was es m.E. positiv von vergleichbaren Spielen unterscheidet, ist die Verwendung von Karten zur Steuerung zentraler Spielaspekte, wobei jede Kriegspartei ein eigenes Deck nutzt. Außerdem hervorzuheben sind die großen Karten mit ihren großen Hexfeldern und mit nahezu sämtlichen wichtigen Informationen, die sich natürlich auch in den zwar trocken, aber für ein Spiel dieser Komplexität überraschend flüssig geschriebenen Regeln finden. Zumindest für mich liegt ein weiterer Pluspunkt in der Möglichkeit, das ‚Kriegsgeschehen‘ bereits ab 1937 (also mit dem Spanischen Bürgerkrieg) einsetzen lassen zu können. Kleineres Minus: Für die gesamte Kampagne sollte man etwa 45-50 Stunden ansetzen.

Updating the previous TK system using many of the ingredients introduced in Dai Senso, thereby also extending the gaming period to 1937-1945 (or even longer). Now you can play out all the pre-war diplomatic shenaningans or even combine TK with DS in an all-out global struggle.

Wonderful grand strategy WWII game. This is the European game that links to Axis Empires: Dai Senso! for all of WWII. The Card system is great, the break down and build up and an extra layer to decisions you need to make, and the random events means you never play the same game twice. Changed my rating to a 10 to off set the "1" trolls and because this game is #3 on my Top 10 in my BGG Profile

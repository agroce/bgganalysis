A crazy race game where winning isn't necessarily the best course of action. I love the group think and incentive ideas that come up during this game. Playing with a healthy bit of negotiation certainly makes it better. One of Dorra's most unique and fun games!

A fun racing game for a growing family.  A lot of fun and you may see other get pukey dice.  I'd highly recommend this in particular for play with a family of growing kids - esp aged 8-12.  It's just right for them and will teach them a lot about Euro gaming.

A good game that's prevented from being a great game by the predominance of luck in it. Mind you, I think it's an ideal game to be played between adult gamers and children.

Nice, harmless, lightweight game.  Nothing amazing, but playable.  Good for getting non-gamers to the table.

RATING: 6
Beautiful bits, an extremely high "fun factor" and more strategy than is at first apparent.

Initially I thought this had no replay value. But after being whipped by 2 elderly ladies we started trying different strategies, and learnt that there's more to this game than just route selection. And now it's one of our favourite games.

UPDATE: There is quite a bit of additional randomness in the interaction of the players' dice throws and the turn order. This can kill the correlation between what one bids and what one gets for that bid. Still a great game, and the fun factor is very high, but this level of randomness can be frustrating at times.

This game drives me nuts because, at some point midway through, someone&#039;s gonna give the frickin&#039; LEADER good dice for only a few more coins than, say, the last place player is offering.  In fact, this will happen SEVERAL times.  Grrr.... (and you can tell that I&#039;m never the leader?)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a good light game.  A large amount of randomness is involved, but it's central to the game.  Since you effectively bid for movement, you can buy favourable rolls, perhaps at the cost of spending yourself out of contention, but at least you get to move your boat :)

Sure it's one of Dorra's lighter games but like someone here on Geek rightfuly said, they are often his best. Don't underestimate the strategic possibilities of this little gem. It boosts one of the most unique bidding/moving mechanics I ever came across. A definitive must-buy for anybody who searches for a boardgame that can be played with both gamers and non-gamers with the same ammount of fun involved.

RATING: 4
A fun super filler that has you rolling dice and placing them on your opponent's ships to grab the most money for the win. The thing is that this is the same money you are going to use to lure your opponents into placing dice on your ships. The dice are used for movement. So you want to have your opponents place the higher dice on your ship. You also race around the islands hoping to be first to reach them to grab the most loot.

There are a few subtleties that make the game interesting and elevate it to more than just a racing game. 

...and how can you beat a vomiting sailor on one the die's face.

JT's comments were exactly how I felt, so I'm going to plagiarize his comments and pretend they are mine:  

"A lot more fun than it initially appears. Moving ships around the board doesn't sound too exciting, but the way that you entice your sailors to come to your ship and then depend on the dice rolls can produce a lot of laughs. And the oft-mentioned "seasick/vomiting guy" face of the die is classic. If you play this with cutthroat players I think there is a lot of opportunity for screwage. This is the type of game where it seems like it does not pay to be too cheap. It plays quickly and is pretty nice when you're in the mood for something fluffy, but a little more substantial than a quick filler card game."

Production: Great board art, wonderful boats, and the best money I've seen in any game.

Play: Lots of fun.  There are some interesting decisions about positioning one's boats and about how much money to place on one's ship.  Rolling the dice is fun, as is deciding how to allocate them.  It's a bit strange, though, when a player can win without placing all their camps. (3+2+3) (3 plays)

[Dorra] A fun little race game, you sail round avenues that are much more constrained than they appear! Novel mechanisms and fast, easy decisions that are meaningful. It has a great amount of friction between players: lots of maneuvering, blocking, deciding your opponents speeds, etc. Though marketed to kids, there's a LOT for the serious gamer to enjoy. Beautiful too. A hidden gem from Mr Dorra!

We finally got to play this little gem. Some tough decisions to be made regarding the paying of crew versus who gets the most moves, but ultimately weighs heavily on the dice. And I'm infamous for my poor dice rolling.  Still, it's a great family game. No down time and moves quickly. And everyone wants to play it again. A rather nice addition to the gaming closet. Wife and 12-year old give it an 8, 10-year old gives it a 9.

RATING: 6
(3-4 players) This seems like a fluffy game, and it pretty much is, but there are interesting mechanics at work. And clearly I don't grasp how it all works because I continue to suck at it!

Even though a player can get back to home base the fastest it's likely they will burn up money to do so, and even though they're first, it's still the player with the most money that wins. So careful money managment is necessary during the entire game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The mechanics of assigning your sailors to the ships is nice and kinda original, unfortunately gaining 25 ducats if you are the first to an island and 5 per other player that stops there seems a little over-costed and the game just turns into a race to the finish rather than a tactical bidding game.
But it is quick and easy to teach.

RATING: 7
I think there is a reported fault in that in playtesting they found that Red usually wins. You have to randomise the starting order or something like that. *** Played again after some time away, it's fun enough but not over serious. More a kids game to be honest, once you get to the dice rolls and sailing, it becomes obvious what is optimal. Still fun though, just don't expect a lot going in. *** Played at Beyond Monopoly! with hardened gamers, very tough stuff, very competitive. good game, worth tracking down if you don't mind a bit of dice luck.

Wow, this turned out to be more fun than I expected. First of all the components are great. Little plastic boats with sails, wooden cubes and some really nice coins, that have a great sound when thrown in your pile. Oh and the gameboard is pretty nice too.

The game is very easy and quick to learn/teach and plays in around 45 minutes or so. It's a 3-4 player game, but 4 player is the real sweet spot for this one. It loses some points when playing with 3.

This is a really fun game and can be cut-throat, which is also fun. I'm very glad, to have finally purchased this game and look forward to many more plays. Give it a try. You just might like it as much, as I do.

A fun race game with some interesting bribing to try get your ship going.  Figuring out how much to bribe can be tough, as you want to offer a decent enough reward, but at the same time, you don't want to put high numbered dice on people you are racing against.  The board is crazy colorful, in fact, I still see the board when I close my eyes.  The box is too big for the contents of the game, but the components are nice.  I like this one.

There seem to be a lot of South Pacific themed games these days. Tonga Bonga, Maori, Tikki Topple, Manila, etc. This one is a race to visit four islands, place a port, and race back to Tonga Bonga. Each turn players place payments to recruit "captains", "1st mates", and "cabin boys" for their respective ships. Then, in turn order, each player rolls three dice and assigns one die to each of the other ships, but not his own. Some dice may be disqualified if they show up "seasick", i.e. a "6". Then the ships are moved a number of squares on the map equal to the total of the dice assigned. Players then take payments for the dice they assigned to the other players' ships. Additional income is had by reaching an island and placing a port. If other players already have a presence, then they get paid as well.

At first, the Kingsburg dice-fest mechanism had me rolling my eyes. However, making offers of payment for the "captain" and "1st mate" dice is critical in getting your ship to move. Be too stingy, like I was one turn, and you may not get any good dice (and moving all but one square)! Be too generous, and your giving money (VP) away to your opponents! Interesting push-pull game, but light enough that one doesn't have to take it too seriously, plus it plays quickly. A decent filler.

MAY 2009. Initial thoughts are that this is a game that game be played easily with a family audience, but there is enough "meat" for a non demanding "gamers game".

I had some terrible die throws, so earned little salary for my crew (sea sickness was rife!) and when I splashed the cash for my boats crew, I was rewarded with some low scoring die (crew) placed on my boat by my family!

And despite that, I think the game has merit. A keeper for family play and as a light (heading towards medium) filler.

A good filler (plays quick). I won my 1st game by being generous in the offers I made.  We did all manage to sail back to home base in the same final round, but by then I had made the most $$$ by being the 1st to deliver most of my goods.

This game is really fun and enjoyable.  It has randomness in the dice but lots of fun decisions to make b/c the dice effects everybody across the board.  I think that the Rum variant (see posting) is a great idea.  For some reason, I wished it had a two-sided board (or a couple of more expansion maps to play on) where one side has a larger map that plays five to six players - that would seem really cool.

RATING: 6
Fun, entertaining dice "fest" where you seek to earn the most money possible.  Inventive use of dice to control ship movement and wage payout.  Besides, who doesn't enjoy the vomit option on the dice roll?  It can be painful to place a large wage on your ship and see low totals of the dice due to low rolls.

I once traded for Tonga Bonga, but didn't get a chance to play it before getting a trade offer for it. Well fast forward about five years and I get a second chance at owning Tonga Bonga which I don't hesitate to jump at. A few days later I get to play TB for the first time and now all I can do is kick myself for not keeping it the first time I had owned a copy. The rules couldn't be more simple for a game pretty much in turn order you will make payment offers for your ship, roll your dice and place them on opponents ships, move your ship, and then collect all that sweet pay. First player to land on four islands and then sail back into the starting point gets a bonus. Most money wins. There, you are welcome, I just explained the rules to you. Have any new players come here and read these before playing the game for the first time. 
Overall the game is straight forward and simple, but the payment and then roll and place mechanic makes this devilishly simple game into a complex game of bluffing and counter bluffing. You and your opponents are always trying to keep each other from landing on the other islands, but you also need the pay they offer to work on their ships. The game offers a few different strategies to try and work out, and much like Modern Art it gives the players room to experiment with some not all too obvious strategies. 
My rating for this may change over time depending on the repetitiveness, but I really don't think it will.

A clever game where players are racing to different islands and receive payouts based on who gets/got to the island first.  First players take their money (which is equal to VPs) and offers it on their boats (to pay for a captain and ship crew).  Then each player rolls three dice (which determines movement).  The brilliant and equalizing factor is that you assign the dice to the other players' ships.  The highest die assigned to each ship earn the captain's payment so in effect you're bribing the players to place their best die onto your ships.  It can actually be a pretty mean game and you're always making decision towards how much you want to help your opponents (tradeoffs between helping the ship your in the most competition and taking their money or not).  There's also some defensive manuevering on the board.  A fun time and let me not forget each die has a range of 1-5 and Puke (Puke isn't assigned to a ship).

Along the same intensity as TTR. You roll dice that moves your opponents' ships. They have to bribe you in order to move their ships around the board. The goal is to create camps and generate cash by getting to ports. Player to win has the most money in the end.

First impression: Played only with Dorra's rum variant and so that dices are rolled before wages. Playing was a fun experience and game seems like one I'd like to play with non-gamers. With gamers it just didn't seem to work very well and took too much time too. There didn't seem to be a correlation between wages and how good sailors you'd get recruited at all...

Update(3.5.2008): When played with non-gamers and rules as written the game went faster and there was more sense in wages and sailors they got. Game was still a bit disappointment as it takes closer to an hour and is quite repetitive. As such the game is going on too long.

Wow, what a neat little game!  Easy to play, but hard to find a winning strategy.  It seems like the best move is determined by what the other players are doing, so changing the players would probably change the feel of the game.  I particularly like the "this or that" strategy.  Your boat can go fast, or you can make a ton of money... but not both.

Strangely similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix in a few ways. It's a race game, but most money wins. Secondly, how you fare is very dependent on what the other players provide you.

On a turn each player places prize money for the other players to provide them with high dice rolls. These dice rolls are then used for movement. Bid high and you will likely move well. Bid low and you've saved money, but won't move far. There are four south Pacific islands to get to and the prize money at each island diminishes rapidly for each subsequent player at each island.

Inevitably, unless you offer exorbitant pay (which is a losing strategy, so you won't), the perceived leader will get given low die rolls by the other players regardless of what's he offering. So the game devolves into deflecting leader perception and offering comparable money to be able to move. And then pray that the dice come your way.

It's a game, like Rette Sich Wer Kann, which the gaming hardnuts will typically lose to the gaming innocents as the former bash themselves up. Optimal with 4 players, poorer with 3, and that's all it plays with - a limiting factor for replayability. 45 mins.

Fairly light game, partially roll and move, partially strategy. Definitely a lot of randomness in the game.

As an innovative auction mechanism and any game that has a seasick die roll can't be all bad.
 
You place bets that their will be good die rolls - and the others will value the money more than position. 
Like how the position in the islands determines payouts.

Like the bits - money is excellent as well as the boats.

fun race game with a great bidding mechanism for determining movement. very clever and fun stefan dorra effort. great filler. there might be issues with a runaway leader, but i would have to play this more to be sure. (i think the runaway leader problem might have more to do with playing against opponents who don't get the bidding, or who actively make bad bids on purpose. i don't think this is a flaw in the game, but rather a symptom of poor sportsmanship, as purposely making bad bids is willfully playing sub-optimally. it would be the game's fault if sub-optimal bids were a winning stategy, but in this game it is not.)

An interesting mix of race game, strategic incentives, and random luck of the dice.  However, things don't really come together as well as they should.  The board feels too restrictive, the turn order is too fixed, there is a serious risk of run-away leader, and in the end, it just isn't that much fun.  Still, I like all of the different mechanics that combine to make this game unique.

Sweet. You make pre-emptive bids and buy each other's die rolls.

Basically, the die-rolling, kiddie version of Intrige.

This is nicely nasty and open ended, as lots of Dorra games are.

Do not play with snooty gamers who will condescend on games with lots of die rolling, and pretty ships.

RATING: 7
Interesting and unique allocation of payments to your crew and the dice you use to get those payments. The rolling of dice is quite luck based but there is enough of that in the game to even the odds. The game took a bit too long and became uninteresting after a couple of first races to the nearby islands.

RATING: 6
Only one play, but a very good play.  The amount of player screwage makes this a very fun game.  I don't mind the amount of luck and the fixed turn order.  Excellent game.  I had rated it at 9, but my next couple plays shows how analysis paralysis can really bog down the game.  It's supposed to be light and quick, but if people think about their decisions too long (>1 min) then the game will overstay its welcome.

RATING: 5
I looked at the dice (bear in mind, this was before I read the rules) and thought, 'Geez, that looks like a seasick sailor leaning over the side the ship!'. Then I read the rules. It was indeed a seasick sailor leaning over the side of the ship. I smiled and knew that this wasn't a bad buy...then I played the game.

Players are trying to sail around islands to establish bases. They offer money to attract higher die rolls in order to move further. I suspect that the game will have a runaway leader problem. The dice/money allocation is interesting. My group tried to spice things up by offering more gold for the second ship position. It made things interesting but the fact that one has so little choice in die allocation just limits one's strategic decisions. 

Gameplay isn't all that hot either. There seems to be optimal moves and lots of blockage. High rolls could help players too. On the plus side, the bits are absolutely gorgeous. 

Good for the kids (probably rate 7 for kids).

A fun light weight nautical racing game with an interesting wagering mechanic. The game has a few drawbacks with this mechanic however the "Rum", "Bonus Payout" and the "Hidden Ducat" variant offer some solutions to mitigate those issue. Enough game here to interest adults and children.

RATING: 8.5
Light and Fun Euro.  Feels very simple, but there are quite a few subtleties that really make this a winner.  This in some ways is like a strange reverse auction game.  Everyone is bidding on potential value.  

Great social interaction as players try to figure out just how to screw each other over while still trying to reap the rewards of a good play.  (Typical Dorra, be still my heart).

This game falls somewhere between a filler and a middleweight Euro.  Perfect for squeezing in "just one more game".

How can you not love a game where you can roll "Vomit".

Randomness of dice rolling is nicely mitigated by being able to bribe people to put their higher rolls on your spaces. 1 play with 3 - probalby better with 4 since you should have more choices (earlier players do, anyway) of where to put your dice. With 3, choices are somewhat limited. Still, a fun game.

RATING: 6
The name is fun to say and it has plenty of dice rolling action.  Moving by trying to entice your opponents to place their big numbers in your section is a novel idea.  I'm not sure how much strategy there is when you really get down to it and it's a smidge too long for such a light game, but it's one I wouldn't mind playing every so often.  Not bad, just doesn't have that certain something that mkes you want to Tonga Bonga again right away.

RATING: 7
[Ravensburger 98 edition] {Nautical, economic; roll-and-move, negotiation; optimal 4p} {basic game 7; Dorra's variant 6} Tonga Bonga is a very nice family game. Recommended! It's thematic, easy to understand, full of player interaction (it may be a little nasty, too). It's fun but can be slightly nasty too. The bits (ships, ducats and dice) are very attractive as well but I hope that the cubes are made as camp-shaded.

[Variant] The Dorra's variant can be used for more experienced gamers. However, I don't like it much because it destroys the fun of the game quite much.

Good game to bridge the gap. I've played this with gamers and non-gamers and both like it. I haven't felt the need to play with the Rum rules. The people I've played with seem to do the self-serving die placements that make the wage system work. The rum rules seem to be more for the players that look beyond the money they can get from wages. But seeing who's around before you set wages would help with strategy, so I might try them just for that.

RATING: 6
This is fairly simple race game, yet it has an interesting use of dice involving bribery that makes it unique.  There is a nice tension between spending money to go fast to make more money, and conserving money and probably moving slower, but retaining more money.  And seasickness is part of the game, which (surprisingly) is a plus.

This can be a wonderfully competitive and frustrating game with plenty of cutthroat action and player interaction. Don't let the kid's game look of the components fool you: there's more to Tonga Bonga than meets the eye, and plenty of opportunity for skillful play and strategy. Be forewarned - placement of the dice each round requires rewarding some players and screwing others, and I've seen tempers flare as a result. Again, this is great fun, but be prepared to take it in stride ...

What an unexpected delight!  Tonga Bonga is perfectly themed for a lighter title that combines wagering and press-your-luck into one sun-drenched tropical exploration.  The oversized boats and the dice, complete with a seasick sailor, are Ravensburger at its best.  Tonga Bonga is a smart experience that charms gamers and families alike.

What a fun little game.

A race game where you try to hire positions on your ship (opponents movement dice) by putting out the most money. This, however, does not guarantee you'll get the best dice. Your opponents may not want to support the leader.

It's also not a straight race. You have to set up shop on four of six islands, so there is freedom in choosing your route. 

It has some fun things going on, the mechanics tie in nicely with the theme all in an attractive presentation.

Update: Couple more plays with four and the rating moves from a 7 to a 6. I think the major flaw is that the money one puts out for hiring has little effect except at the extremes. Much more depends on what everyone rolls. Even more importantly, which person in turn order rolls what. Therefore there is little incentive to bidding extreme amounts and players settle into a narrow range to avoid being an outlier.

Also, if you have three bad movement rounds out of the first four or five you will have an incredibly difficult time catching up as half of your trade income ends up being paid out to the ships that beat you to the islands.

If i do not figure out a way out of these two problems I will have to give this a final rating of 5 and sell it.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 1
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 1
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 2
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 1

Another 'racing' game that I really enjoy. I guess it's because whoever has the most money at the end wins, not the guy who finishes first. The key, I think, is know when to put out a lot of money for a crew, and when to hold back. I'm a bit cheaper than others on this phase, knowing that those are essentiantially VPs going out on the board...

Nice looking game that seems to be a bit too much luck-driven for my liking. Tactics play a role, but as long as you are throwing high numbers a steady income is almost guaranteed (and money definitely creates more money in this game). In our game, the gap between the first and the last two players quickly became huge, and half way through it became obvious that the last player (not me) did not have any chance to turn the tide.
Played only once sofar, with four players.

More classic Dorra genius! You really have to balance your short-term greed for bribes with your longer-term positioning. I love it. Tricky in that the luck isn't necessarily in rolling well yourself, but everyone else rolling well when you have good bribes. Don't bother with 3 players though.

Neat little game with great plastic parts!  Players pay to get good sailers (meaning good dice rolls), but someone will get that money depending on dice rolls and quantity of money involved.  You can play this 2 player but if you do each person will have to play 2 colors, and keep the money seperate. It is worth it to get the game on the table more often!  Surprising number of decisions to make considering how simple the game is.

A light filler.  One of the original dice/worker placement games.  It definitely fits a nice spot in the collection.

After not playing Tonga Bonga for a long time, I pulled it out with a bunch of gamers, and it was fun.  I thought it was going to be too light, but it fit well.  Obviously a filler, and not a main course, but it is fine for what it is.

The game dances along at a spry pace until the completely broken endgame comes along.  As others have stated, once you're significantly ahead on money and someone is headed back to base, there's no need to establish any more camps or spend any more money.  You just steer your treasure-laden ship in circles until someone else ends the game.

A shame, really, because the mechanic of tempting other players with money to enhance your own movement is pretty slick.

The obvious variant is to forbid someone from winning unless they've established all four camps.  A better payout ($15-20) for the person ending the game also wouldn't hurt.

In my first game I also did the unimagined:  I rolled three seasick sailors all at once.  Them's low odds, cap'n.

The illustration and typography on the cover is ridiculous! The illustration of the board, the dice and those massive ships are really nice. Cool mechanic to hire your crew. But be aware: that is one of the most capitalistic game you'll ever play besides Monopoly! The more money you get, the more money you get!!! Now you just can loose if you have very bad luck with the dice and at least one other player has the absolute kill-streak with their dice. So it's a nice game to start the gaming night. The following second or main-game shouldn't be a cooperative game, because all the losers want to see the winner suffer :D

Novel! The necessity to constantly switch and shift alliances really really suited me well; one needs to think on one's feet, and it helps to talk quickly too, it seems. Brilliant connection of theme and mechanics, I really like this. (Played with 3, this works well.)
OT: Now I want to write an RPG to go along with this boardgame. Alas!

(Sold to make room on my shelves.)

It just arrived from Poland!  I'll rate it after we get some plays in.

Update:  This game has a neat concept that I really enjoy.  However, the fact that that it is essentially a find-the-best-path puzzle game makes turns near the end really drag out, at least with my group.  It gets pretty painful, which unfortunately limits the fun I have with the game.  This one appears to be DOA with my group due to these issues.

My initial thoughts about Alcatraz proofed to be right. It plays more in the metagame than in the actual gameplay. The mechanics arent important its more how you play the game and how to convince the others. It feels a bit like Panic Station but with a less clever traitor mechanism. In Panic Station the traitor number might grow whether in Alcatraz the scapegoat mechanism doesnt work well wnough. You normally dont give the scapegoat to the weakest player (which was the intention of the designers) but to one member of the group which is about to flee to simply take the weaker players even more opportunities to catch up.

Not the most straight-forward game, but it encourages some neat interactions.  I just think the "ganging-up on the little guy" direction is a little off-putting and probably makes the game really un-fun for THAT guy.

At its heart, Alcatraz: the Scapegoat has quite an interesting idea.  Other co-op games have a "traitor" (in this game he's a scapegoat), but in no other is that person elected each round.  In addition, while there are weapons available to the scapegoat (blackmail cards, theft of items), it is sometimes not in the scapegoat's interests to be beastly.  Similarly, it sometimes is in the interests of one of the team to be uncooperative.  Interesting.

And yet, I haven't warmed to this game.  A problem with it is that a win for the system seems unlikely, so it lacks the tension of the best co-ops.  There's only just enough to keep Alcatraz fairly cooperative. More seriously, an individual can snooze through the game and still be a winner if lucky enough to complete a task letter that is never seen again.

Production quality is decent and the artwork is evocative.  The rules are an easy read.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice concept, innovative mechanism (scapegoat) but I feel it lacks something in the execution. Its a semi-cooperative game where players try to escape from Alcatraz but someone has to stay behind. The rules are somewhat easy and the setup will not take long. The room tiles are drawn random each time and they are double-sided for increased replayability. I have mixed feelings about this game. The end game feels lame. Some players will have some parts of the plan (even from early in the game) that will make them indispensable to the team.

The game is great, but there is one major problem. You always need 4 players and all 4 of them have to know the game well. If you play any other game and one player will play poorly - nothing happen, you still fight for victory (except for kingmaking situations). But here one player who plays badly will just lose and there will be no tension in the game.

Kellemes kooperatív játék. A rabok együtt próbálnak szökni, de mindig kiközösítenek valakit maguk közül, és aki épp a szökés pillanatában a bűnbak, az a vesztes. A bűnbaknak több lehetősége van társainál, ő zsarolással tehei magát nélkülözhetetlenné, és elérheti, hogy mást közösítenek ki helyette a többiek. Rosszabb esetben (ha nem sikerül a szökés az utolsó körig) mindenki veszít. Sok ötlet tetszett, pl. a rendőrök, ki mennyire fontos (a szökési tervhez ki mennyit tud hozzátenni), stb. A játék hihetetlen jól visszaadja azt az intrikus hangulatot, amikor 4 ember nagyon akar valami előnyből részesülni, de 1 szükségképpen kimarad belőle: 1. dögöljön meg a szomszéd tehene effektus: "ha én nem szökök, akkor ti sem!" 2. "Inkább őt hagyjuk itt, kevésbé fontos, semmit sem tud hozzátenni a szökéshez." Kb. ilyen stílusban zajlik az egész, tehát sértődékeny emberekkel TILOS játszani, és komolyan venni is tilos a játékot. Engem ott hagytak a szemetek a börtönben, mégsem haragszom rájuk:).
A kártyák miatt elég nagy a szerencsefaktor, pl. sokáig nem húztunk D, E kártyát, aztán egymás után feljöttek (A-tól F-ig össze kell gyűjteni 1-et, hogy kész legyen a szökési terv...)
Egynek jó volt, de nem kell egy korszakos játékra gondolni.

Ilyen (anti)koperatív játékkal még nem játszottam, egészen különleges a hangulata.
Igazán jól visszaadja azt a helyzetet, amikor nem mindenki érhet el agy adott célt (szökés), és ha ő a börtönben marad, akkor a többiek is maradjanak...
Szamaritánusokkal és mimóza lelkületűekkel nem szabad neki kezdeni.

Sok jó ötlet van benne, és mivel a helyszínek kétoldalasak változtatható a játék nehézsége.
További előny a viszonylag rövid játékidő. (13 kör után mindenképpen befejeződik)
Az agyroppantást hagyjuk más játékokra, ez könnyedebb kategória.

First Impression: This is a semi-cooperative game with an interesting theme. However, semi-coops are something I actively try to avoid as I find that if you feel that you'll lose the game anyways, there's little motivation to allow someone else to win. Is it better to lose alone, or together?

[i]Alcatraz[/i] was the darling of BGG.con for me.  A dynamically shifting, asymmetrical cooperative game.  I haven't played anything like it, and when played with the right group it was amazing.

The players are inmates, working together to complete their plan of escape.  The plan has six elements, labeled A through F.  When the plan is complete, the players escape and win.

The catch is that someone is going to be left behind.  Each round, someone is elected to be "The Scapegoat."  If the other players can assemble a complete set of plan elements between them, then they win and the Scapegoat loses.  However, if the Scapegoat possesses a unique element of the completed plan, then the Scapegoat escapes and a different player whose contributions aren't critical (his letters are duplicates) is left behind.

This set-up creates an atmosphere of, "I'll help you by being the Scapegoat if you don't try to duplicate my letters."  If you're elected Scapegoat when you're already non-essential, then you do everything in your power to keep the other players from escaping that round.  The game is brilliantly full of backstabbing and betrayal.  Which means it only works if you're playing with people who like that sort of game.  At BGG.con, I spent most of my time playing games with friends from [geekurl=/werewolf]the Werewolf community[/geekurl].  This type of game was just our style, and it was incredibly enjoyable as a result.

While visiting the Funagain store, I heard that this game had been picked up by a U.S. distributor.  I'm looking forward to picking it up at my first opportunity!

First Play: Although quite short the rules took some understanding and explaining. Somethings are unsaid that took immersion in play to fully understand (like the two columns of room dscriptions correspond to opposite board sides). Once launched the banter was fun and interesting as players turned from hostile to cooperative with each other in the same sentence. 

However the game was over sooner than we anticipated by virtue of a random card drawn after an escape plan section was realised. All in all it seemed a strange experience with no real sense of build up, just premature end. It needs another play but at this stage it seems this could be a unique, sound game but lacks a meaningful end game mechanism. 

I'm afraid this one just didn't stir enough emotion to justify being played again or kept. Sold Feb 2012.

The essence of the game is, you choose one player to lose.  What an absolutely poor concept for a game.  The mechanics they built on it were fine, but could not overcome the "bad idea" that this game was built upon.

In our play, I could team with one other player to complete all objectives save one.  We were required, the final two players were interchangeable.  So, we got to "king-make" and pick one of them to join us for the win.  Was it their fault for being in this situation?  Possibly, but what a crummy situation to come up; and I bet it comes up often.

RATING: 2
Alcatraz can be summed up in two adjectives: pointless and boring.

Every time you draw for a new scapegoat you wonder why the game didn’t come up with an old-times hidden traitor, that would make playing more fun with all the guessing and bluffing: in fact in Alcatraz you couldn’t care less who’s the scapegoat even if it is you, as nothing in the game makes you really long for winning. You simply feel you’re wasting your time with an unworthy game.

As far as theme goes then, you never feel any scrap of it behind any action you take, starting with the unrealistic extreme freedom to move and act through the whole jail inmates are given.

I've wanted to play this game since it came out, and missed out at Essen 2011 because the stall was always too busy. Finally got the chance, but was majorly disappointed. It is a competitive, coop game, but this seems to be the reason why it doesn't work very well. There are times when you need the help of others to complete the tasks, but we found the incentives to co-operate very low - why would I help another player to get the objective? There is nothing in it for me. Maybe we were missing something, but there also wasn't the same tension in this game as there is in other co-ops.

I'm not a fan of co-ops in general, and this one isn't a whole lot different.   The mechanics of targeting other players is kinda fun because it at least keeps people on their toes, but in the end this game is largely an exercise in collecting items from rooms.   Not really all that compelling.

first game with three players worked fine and we liked it
second game with four players didn't because we got to the unfortunate point where any combination of three players could win which kind of breaks the game

will play again but with three players only

I've never felt like such an ass trying to not lose a game.  Awesome.  It may be a co-op, but someone is the loser so its incredibly competitive and when you find yourself in the odd man out, you try your best to screw the others until someone else is the loser.  Pure good times with players that don't get too easily pissed at each other, but then again, maybe thats the best crowd.

An all right game that never really clicked with me.  Seemed like a little too much work, and then the final "screw you" bit to determine the scapegoat just resulted in an unsatisfying end to the game.

RATING: 7.5
If you want to make new friends, this isn't one for you.  If your friends enjoy a little torture go on ahead.  Constant temporary alliances pop up to work towards the escape and if you have the most needed goods you can use leverage to negotiate and make demands from your "cellmates".  If you're not bringing a ton to the table, then maybe you start making threats of waylaying the plan unless they help you become more vital to the escape.  The rules could be a bit clearer and play a bit smoother at times, but the theme of a scapegoat can lead to some interesting dynamics if you have the devious mind for such business.

RATING: N/A
A game with simple action points (even if they are not called that) and an ever-changing ‘weakling’ with special powers; and a victory condition which sees at least one player lose. That is in short the core mechanic of Alcatraz. Subjectwise it of course deals with escaping from prison. I’m not sure I like the idea of inmates escaping for real, but I can imagine that we’re all maltreated Andy Dufresnes looking desperately for a way out. (And it is still a game, after all.) 

The players are going to collect parts of a Grand Master Plan, and once a sufficient number of parts has been obtained, they make their escape. The snag is that the players are required by the rules to vote one of them ‘scapegoat’, who will not be able to collect parts of the Plan, but can play cards which delay the Plan’s execution. The scapegoat becomes stronger in terms of the number of actions he can carry out if he stays scapegoat for more than round, so it’s not wise to let someone remain scapegoat for long. The actions themselves are fairly simple stuff: walking around, collecting resources, trading them for a part of the Plan, or inciting a riot. The latter action is important to draw away guards from ‘blocked’ areas so other players can carry out actions there. The game ends when the Grand Plan is complete, or the number of guards exceeds a certain number.

So far so good. Regrettably I and my fellow players entered the game with the wrong idea on how it ‘ticked’, in other words treat it as a coop with an unfortunate loser. This leads to a contrived metagame which doesn’t really work, at least not for us. The scapegoat mechanism is more insidious than just punishment: it is a weapon to be used at the right time in order to delay others and to arrive at interesting spots earlier than others. There is no way I can retrofit my experience onto this idea, so for now I’ve removed my rating. If the opportunity presents itself, I’ll try the game anew and see how it holds up then.

For me big part of the fun is table-talk; think of: "If you steal it from me, I'll follow you across the board to steal it back even if we stay behind together then"; game sticks well together and is exciting to the end; setup is quick and playing time is limited; the expansion is not necessary but gives more options.

Rating at first blush.  I think I spent too much time playing the game and not the players.  Cool mechanics but it didn't come together for me partly because I forgot some of the actions. I need more plays when I dont have to spend so much time figuring out who we need and who we don't.

Maybe Istanbul gained inspiration from this game. The board is made up of tiles laid out in a similar fashion, but it really is a negotiation and action point semi-cooperative game with a prison theme. You collection sets of goods to complete objectives around the board. Moving around the board is a simply spending actions like Istanbul. Not that into the theme but it is an okay and unique design.

Your trying to get help from your prison mates to break out but at the same time trying to screw them over. I'm not sure how "thematic" that really is but a lot of the game came down to the voting so you really need an apporpriate group of gamers to play.

With the game I played it came down to the last vote on scapegoat to decide the winners. I guess that technically means it was a close game, but it just felt anti-climatic and a bit of fizzer instead.

Giochiamo quindi a Alcatraz: The scapegoat con l'espansione Massima Sicurezza. 

5 carcerati, una sola possibilità di fuga e uno dovrà rimanere in carcere. Il gioco prosegue tranquillo credo fino al terzo turno massimo. Il resto è stata una serie di colpi bassi, pugnalate alla schiena, furti, insulti. Proprio nello spirito del gioco! Il fatto che uno debba rimanere in carcere e risultare, quindi, l'unico perdente è la minaccia che fa scoppiare la polveriera. Un gioco piuttosto rapido, semplice ma veramente, veramente da sciacalli. L'abbiamo adorato.

GREAT DESIGN!!! We had a lot of fun. The system is very simple rules and innovative dynamics for sure. At the same time there is a deep strategy, high interaction, many meaningfull choices and - because of many factors of convertibility of the setup and the cards drawn but a lot of replayabilty. The artwork and the texts and titels deepens the theme.

After some plays (lower the rating from 10 to 9) we wonder, how high the luckfactor really is / whether everyone has "a chance not to loose". But still it is fun to play.

Huh? Maybe we were missing something but we didn't quite get this game as to how to go about it. We worked together at first, even as the scapegoat, but then I was made the scapegoat permanently. By this time, however, the other two players had collected what they needed and simply escaped without me. Very anticlimactic. But perhaps we were missing something or it's just not good with only 3P instead of the full 4.

My rating: 7.5
Players: 3-4
Duration: 45-60 mins
Type: Co-op/partnership

Players are jailed convicts one of whom will lose, or all can lose--never will all win.  And that is where the fun comes it.  Each round prisoners gang up on another and then can betray their tenuous partnerships. Meanwhile the scapegoat can blackmail and if others consecutively put him down, his position grows stronger.  Prisoners steal from and rat on one anothe, and there are no hidden enemies.

Very satisfyingly cutthroat.  A balanced game were prisoners temporarily working together can keep the leader in check while sneakily strengthening their own position.  Some luck, but stronger on strategy, negotiation, and bluffing.  

Better than Panic Station which I felt had been published without enough corrective play testing. I like the art too, and it plays in less than an hour.  Room icons are easy to remember.

This is a nice link between co-op and partnership games--fills a spot I didn't know was empty.

RATING: 6.5
Nasty backstabbing game. If played well and with the right group, a good session may be worth an 8 or even a 9. But if someone isn't playing the way he is supposed to (f.i. always picking on the same guy, even though voting for someone else would be more appropriate), it can completely ruin a session. It's also quite a brainburner, with all the details you've got to keep an eye on. And it also plays a bit counterintuitive, as one time you're trying to succeed, while next round you try making the group fail. Playing too nice may lead to an easy escape and an early ending, while playing too nasty may lead to group failure, dragging the game. It's about finding the right balance.

I'm actually not so fond of backstabbing in general. Such as stealing items from each other, playing blackmail cards, moving guards to block others from performing an element of the escape plan, ... though they are the core of this game. And given its theme and unique mechanism of forming different partnerships throughout the game, I don't mind it as much as I normally do.

For now I stick with a 7, but it can still go up or down if next plays prove to be more/equally/less fun than my solo test play. I'm worrying a bit about the possibility to lose the game even if having completed 2 elements more than all other players. Imagine you completing your 4th task (element F) when already having elements A-B-C, while the other players have A-B (the scapegoat), C-D & E. If the reward also happens to be element F, the three others escape and you're left behind. Luck of the draw for the last reward can be quite crucial !

A cooperative game where only one of the players lose? Yes! It's something appealing for people like me, not too fond of those games where there is no competition... 

Based on abilities collected through mission cards and votings of the players, one will have to savour the dust from the cells while their fellows perform the jailbreak. A wide range of actions to do and a variable modular board guarantees replayability. 

Prison theme, possibility to steal... Maybe not politically correct? Sometimes unfair? Some people may get angry when being the only one bound to stay in jail? Forget all these questions and answers, this is just fun!

Very funny game if you choose wisely with who to play! 
Pro: Quick and easy to learn. Incredible nice images.  Carries easily to laughters!! It's not about winning the game, it's more about having fun and messing around with the other players.
Con: If you can, play it with 4 or 5 players (with expansion) because with 3 players it easily ends up being a 2 against 1 game! the movements are a little bit confusing and the mechanism isn't very good.

Not a fan of this flip-flopping semi-coop game.  Gameplay is quite simple.  It does have problems with the scapegoat voting system.  I'd "recommend" that the scapegoat gets an additional vote at +2 and two extra votes at +3.  This could alleviate the chances that someone is always stuck as the scapegoat.

Personal: my favorite semi coop game. Just take the idea of having a traitor, but not always the same as it can/ should change form turn to turn. This has been implemented on a clever way (should not choose turn by turn the same person). How to define it? the game where everybody looses or just one

RATING: 7.8
Must have the right group! My group really liked it, and this is a game that does something no other games have done AFAIK. The key to the game is leverage and when to apply it. For example, I was able to complete a unique objective and then later able to put both other players in a position of benefitting me, even if I was the scapegoat. Very well-done game with a very good balance of obtaining stamina, cash, and resources. This isn't a game I'd play often due to the intensity, but it's unique in my collection and I'm glad to have it.

Can be a lot of fun with the right group. A semi-cooperative game where everyone works together, but not everyone can win. Each round, one player is voted to be the scapegoat, the person who stays behind to make sure the others escape. Sort of like Hot Potato, it becomes more dangerous to be the scapegoat the longer the game goes on.

RATING: 7.5
A very good semi-cooperative game.  The basic concept of the game is to collect sets of items and bring them to the proper location to reach part of the overall goal.  Nothing new here.  What really lets the game shine are two new elements: First the scapegoat: in each round, one player has to be the scapegoat which means that this player has additional actions but will not be able to reach a (partial)goal.  Secondly there is the winning condition: To end the game, it is neccessary to leave at least one player behind which means that all players carefully try to make themselves indispensable.  

These two elements create a nice athmosphere of distrust and shifting alliances.  And furthermore, they eliminate the core problem of many cooperative game, namely the fact the most experienced player(s) tend to tell the others what to do. 

All in all, one of the better (best?!) cooperative games I've played so far.

RATING: 6
The scapegoat mechanic is interesting, but even for a prison game this seems a bit too locked down and claustrophobic - there's very little to do, and a lot of the time there's not much excitement around the selection of the scapegoat,

P/u & del, negotiation, semi-coop, screwage, voting

Indeed a great unique nasty fun little game here of lie, bluff, steal and manoeuvre; no direct comparisons I can think of game-wise, the voting and temporary alliances do remind me of the old reality show Survivor where the least useful or liked person gets voted off, here they get voted the Scapegoat.  

I thought there were some nice options for actions and such, so far have only played once and it was mostly a learning game but the 'light' started coming on about half way through for people where strategic and devious juices started flowing. Potential for nastiness is there especially when playing the Goat, will depend on your group how far you want to take it, you could even play mostly nice if you wanted. 

I think there are 2 'potential' small solvable issues that have been brought up in the forums and comments, notice the word "solvable". One is with the random letter burning people and the other with a task letter potentially never coming up so impossible to win (kinda like pandemic when cards are stacked against you). Both are easily tweaked, just look in the variant section. Both really shouldn’t happen very often either especially the non-win one so probably not really necessary to tweak, both never happened in my first game. The one thing I am not sure about yet is the game end and determining the 'loser'; it could be that it is just too easy to "vote" for the loser rather than it being determined by who played the crappiest, not sure yet.  

Should play in 60 minutes which is a great time for this, not sure yet if 3 or 4 will be better, likely 4. 

--------------------------

Doing my own escape from Prison but this is way different in a great way.
 
"Players will bluff, rat out, rob, betray and blackmail other players" to win...

Sounds nasty and like good fun!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (January 2013)

I have only played it with the silver side tiles.

Alcatraz: The Scapegoat seemed like a good idea but something is missing from the game and we ended having almost no fun playing this. I’m very disappointed as I have huge hopes for it :(. The theme is great as is the main idea behind the game, a cooperative game where someone will be left behind appealed to me a lot, however I found the game to be somewhat dull. Perhaps we played it too nice, but I never felt any tension in the game. Being the scapegoat isn’t a huge handicap and making yourself indispensable to the escape plan is mostly luck as many times you can get a RANDOM part of the plan done for NOT being the scapegoat. I dislike this mechanic as it doesn’t have any thematic sense (all the players that “helped” should get the same part of the plan) and adds lots of uncontrollable luck (which I dislike). Also the decisions are (somewhat) obvious, you need to complete the plan so you need to get the requirements so mostly you can calculate what you need to do and how long it will take. The scapegoat has huge power but as the betrayal cards are (more or less) hard to get, most of the time he doesn’t stop anything. 

Bottom line, Alcatraz is a mediocre game, I´m glad I sold my copy of the game. I will play it again if requested but I won´t seek further plays of this.

Great game, plays really well and there is a lot of exciting backstabbery along the way, while being painfully aware that the prison guards are going to lock down the whole thing unless the players cooroporate.

HOWEVER: The ending is really anti-climactic. Boom, it's over, oh I've won or oh I've lost. Was really dissapointed that this exciting game just ends on a whimper

Would rate the game higher if this was somehow fixed (expansion?)

RATING: 7
You have to commend the game for the novel mechanism. Though I still greatly prefer a traitor mechanism like in Resistance, this is a lot of fun if your group can handle a bit of meanness in a game. I can see how some people could get their feelings hurt, but as long as you explain that the game is about trying to make yourself indispensable, I think it's fine.

I think the main thing that holds the game back from greatness is the extreme luck of the tile draw when accomplishing missions. I guess since there's a finite number of missions you can track and try to predict probability, but you can really get hosed if the wrong tile makes you significantly less necessary for the group.

Was quite excited about this but worried that most wouldn't like it because of the "one loser" idea. Turns out it's less about trying to force one person to lose and more about jockeying for position on the winning side. Has a someone logic puzzle feel which isn't too bad. Very solid game.

Bei Alcatraz sind wir alle Gefangene im berühmten Namensgebenden Gefängnis und planen einen Ausbruch. Für einen erfolgreichen Ausbruch braucht man 6 kleinere Pläne, für die man jeweils Items benötigt, die es auf dem Spielplan an verschiedenen Orten zu holen gibt. Pro Runde ist jeweils einer von uns der Sündenbock, der, wenn eine Aufgabe vollendet wird, nichts davon abbekommt. Dafür hat er aber mehr Aktionen und kann Erpresserkarten ausspielen.
Das Spiel endet, sobald die Gruppe zusammen die Pläne A-F hat. Wer am wenigsten dazu beigetragen hat die Pläne zu bekommen, bzw. derjenige, der zur Erfüllung des Plans ersetzbar ist bleibt zurück und verliert als Einzger. Alle anderen haben dann kooperativ gewonnen.
Ein Spieler hat in der vorletzen Runde den Plan "F" vom Plan abgeworfen und somit wurde es unmöglich für uns das Spiel noch zu gewinnen. Hätte er das nicht getan, hätten wir jemanden zum Sündenbock gemacht, die Aufgabe erfüllt und den Sündenbock im Knast zurückgelassen.
Das Spiel hat leider ein paar Regelschwächen. Wenn ich es drauf angelegt hätte, hätte ich einen Spieler in einer Ecke des Gefängnisses mit etlichen Wachen festsetzen können und er wäre wohl nicht mehr so schnell da raus gekommen. Ausserdem sind die Entfernungen zu den Orten teilweise sehr lange. Dadurch dass man sich auch oft in den Rücken fällt sind Aufgaben schwer zu schaffen...
Gute Idee, aber leider kommt das Spiel unter den Hammer ;).

Alcatraz is an interesting idea for a game, having 3 of 4 people escape or all fail to escape. In theory it sounds great however one of the game mechanic is really off to me, when someone completes a plan, all other non scapegoat player get some part of the plan as well by drawing a card. It just feels really off.

Co-op game with an interesting twist: One player looses

Everything felt quite nicely designed, although the somber mood of this game might not appeal to everyone.
Our strongest gripe was the fact that when a player completes a part of the plan, the other players (except the scapegoat) get a random part of the escape plan. This can arbitrarily spoil one's plans and doesn't feel right.

Great mechanics, very possible to make for a bad night since inevitably someone has to get left behind.  Play carefully. If it helps, the game appears to have a formula to determine who gets left out BEFORE you have to vote or make any kind of case to determine who to axe. That saved us a lot of headache in the end, though the player it happens to can surely see it coming.

Not a perfect game by any means, but one you can easily put on the table if your regular group is in-your-face and cut-throat enough to handle the scapegoat-mechanism. So in that regard the thematic implementation is quite neat, innovative and quite frankly, bold.

The good news: you and your buddies think you can escape from Alcatraz!  The bad news, your escape will only work if one of you is left behind as the scapegoat for you plan.  This semicooperative game has a wonderful theme where you and your gamer friends are trying to assemble a plan of escape by visiting different sections of Alcatraz and picking up items to use for your escape.  Every round however, you must vote against one player who then tries to thwart your plans next round.  Very unique idea.  You all lose or your all escape except one player you leave behind.  Wonderful components and artwork add to the game.  You can lay out different locations each game so no two games will be exactly alike.  Love the idea of this highly underrated game

This offers a unique twist on the "co-operative with traitor" game. This game is "co-operative with betrayal", where the players pick a scapegoat who has to stay behind while the others escape the prison. For some, this adds a degree of nastiness to the play that goes beyond the routine cut and thrust of conventional 'take that' games. It is certainly a game that is sociological and psychologically very interesting.

Too many mechanics for what the game offers. I may be hasty on this call, but I do have other games that do the "throw somebody under the bus" that concentrate on that and do not add the extra movement/think aspect. Though that is interesting, I did not care for that aspect.

Awesome negotiation game. Being the scapegoat isn't so bad, but watch out, because if you play the nice guy too often you'll find the other prisoners taking advantage of you when escape time rolls around.
Collecting all of the elements of the plan is easy when everyone is getting along, but the mood is guaranteed to change when someone realizes they're not getting out. There's more than a few ways to throw a wrench in the gears.
I worry that the random board setup and card draws can influence the game too much. As the scapegoat I sometimes found myself with very few meaningful options based strictly on luck. Hopefully the trying the flip-side of certain location boards will help with this.
Overall: It's a very simple game with a not so simple theme. As long as the players can avoid any hard feelings this is fantastic game of bullying.

A fast playing cooperative game with a tweak...

Captured this at Essen 2011. You are trying to flee from the prison of Alcatraz.Together with the other players you have to complete different parts of the escape plan by delivering objects to certain locations. everybody participating in this task will mark a part of the plan on his sheet. When a group of players is able to form a full set of plans (A - F) they do escape, leaving behind the others to rod in their cells for all eternity (or until the next play).

Awesome game that feels quite unique. The changing "traitor" element and the possibility of everyone losing have to be balanced to master this game. There is a lot of strategies to exploit in a game of only 4 pages of rules which is playing under 1 hour! Although it might have some flaws in its design, I am really looking forward to playing this again. Player interaction and theme are great pluses here. Recommended!

Intriguing cooperative game with the twist that it's not the players against the system, but the players maneuvering to have importance with the other players as to not be the expendable sole loser.

After two plays I have concerns both about the luck of receiving the random letters and the end game, but I find this pretty fun and would like to explore those concerns rather than pass judgement yet.

Component upgrade is basically required. I can't identify with those wooden cylinders at all.

RATING: 4.5
[u]Needs the right group [/u]. Probably best with friends who know each other well and are not of a gentle sort. You also must know in advance what to expect. The core of the game is doing co-op tasks, but... somebody will lose
 
There's a strong incentive to get unique tasks done and strong motivation to stop anybody getting away with it. So first half of the game was all about stopping everyone from doing anything, while the second half pushed cooperation . So you're trying to make plans and backstab at the same time and time itself is running out(the cops can overrun the prison and you all lose). The opaque winning conditions I think help the game, as it could be difficult to judge who the loser will be (namely one with no unique task results). 

I think the game is best enjoyed as a loud and hilarious ride. If you have that kind of group. For me the level of intensity was a bit too much - every minute you have to propose plans and make whatever offers you can and try not to get shafted. I like Diplomacy more as it's not as intense all the time. A mid-game break we had was much appreciated. I have to try intrigue as well and make final assessment (I also must play this with friends)

EDIT: a solo play later. It's a game that does very well what it wants to do. The theme works, the mechanics are simple (as you wish them to be for heavy interactive game) and the dynamics of the game are interesting. The game basically balances itself by people not willing to help others until they have to or it might be too late. It's a brilliant idea, and very neatly tied to the theme. So for anybody looking for a screw you game within thematic framework (!), this is a good one. I'm not sure if it's for me (too intense), but I must play it with a different group first.

Great negotiation game. Yes, it does involve some amount of luck, but the mixture of cooperation and competition is really intriguing.

It's highly interactive, to the point that you spend more time negotiating than actually doing stuff. It's not a traitor game at all since there is not even any hidden information; Rather, it's a negotiation game, and feels a lot like a mixture between Space Alert, Pandemic, and a little bit of Diplomacy. Basically you have to work together in order to win at all; At the same time, you want to become indispensable yourself. But you can't let the others fall behind too much, because when someone thinks he doesn't have any chance to win any more, he will prefer everyone to lose over losing alone. Frankly, I'm even tempted to say that it's more interaction training than game, and while I'm not sure it's everyone's piece of cake, there are several people with whom I could imagine highly enjoying it.

Just one small nitpick: For randomly choosing one out of twelve locations, a simple 12-sided die would have been much more useful than 12 cards from which one is drawn at random -- especially because it is needed so frequently.

An interesting, mean quasi-cooperative game. Players attempt to escape the infamous Alcatraz prison and in order to do this all six steps have of the escape plan have to be executed. Only the players who can't be missed for the execution will win the game and successfully escape. All others are left behind. The designers have stated they wanted a game driven by negative emotions and with that they have succeeded I guess, although our first game was still a bit mechanical as we were still learning the rules. Still, there was some evil meta-gaming going on. But, more plays will see if it can truly live up to our expectations of such a game.

A fun, fun game - those Polish do know how to make a solid game. It's got a great theme and art, plus it makes for an interesting "mostly cooperative", where you're all working together until you have to backstab someone at the last minute. There's a variety of things that you can do that make it interesting, whether it's dealing with the guards, collecting items, or messing with your fellow prisoners. This is probably the best game I've played in the last few months.

RATING: 7
An exciting and entertaining negotiating game. There is great tension in this semi-cooperative game where inmates work on completing portions of the escape plan, trying to appear indispensable to the overall plan so as not to be the poor sod who gets left behind. The balancing mechanism (more APs) which discourages continually voting in the same scapegoat works well, as does the limited 21 game turns.

I don't usually care for cooperative games, so my rating comes with a grain of salt.  It felt like there wasn't that much going on in the game-there is some strategy but you really do have to get lucky.  Also, the turns aren't captivating enough-a lot of moving around without many interesting decisions.  Lastly, the game is a little too cutthroat for my taste.  I'm sure others will enjoy it much more though.

RATING: 5.5
Played once with 4 players, and we all lost.  The graphics and mechanics are nice, but the game forces an unsatisfying choice with strategic players: either you cooperate more and hope that you are not the one left out, or you screw other players to ensure you have a unique part of the escape plan. The former path leads to a random loser, and the latter probably ensures a group loss, it seems.  I might try it again to see if I can bridge those two strategies.  In any case, the card balance seems off, because you have to complete a lot of unnecessary tasks (especially with the free card for other players) to get the last one needed.

RATING: 7
Interesting concept of a semi-cooperative game, where you have to make sure that your partial achievement to the overall goal is not obsolete, because one player (whose achievements are not needed) is the sole loser aka "The Scapegoat".

I think it will take a few plays for the required subtlety of the scapegoat to really come out, but this plays pretty well.

In our first game, within 5 minutes, we had lies and threats and promises of loyalty and then lots of stealing and running away.

This game could be great and I look forward to trying out the 'B' sides of the locations.

Update: The B sides do add a little variety without being game-changing or game-breaking. Mostly, they offer the opportunity to swap items without the use of an AP.

I like the game, but too often there was little to debate or argue about as it was clear who could stop the plan and who couldn't. Random card draws, both in missions and in Scapegoat cards, seem to determine the winner(s) more than I'm happy with. So very nearly a great game, but for me it just lacks that little magic spark.

Rating down from 7.6 to 6.5

RATING: 7.5
Pretty interesting game that reminds me of a cross between Ghost Stories (i.e. mostly cooperative, and using tiles to do things) and a crazy game of Mafia/Werewolf where alignment constantly flip-flops.

The players are trying to complete a set of goals, but at any moment one of them is the "Scapegoat" who cannot get credit for any collective achievements. He also gets more moves (and increasingly more), to make it unattractive to have the same player as Scapegoat constantly. Maybe thematically this represents the player's increased motivation from his anger at being excluded. The players [i]very[/i] frequently are voting on who will be the new Scapegoat, basing the vote mainly on who can be the most useful in working towards the goals.

So, I enjoy the tricky decisions and potential for negotiation/debate that exists in this game. It gets high marks just for that. However, I do think the game feels too short, too random, too tactical/reactive, and ultimately a bit insubstantial. (Also, possibly too easy to avoid collective defeat.) You can often be the game's lone loser simply because you were the last Scapegoat. It's hard to feel that you "played poorly" or anything in this case.

...I still feel this is a really interesting design. My  main dissatisfaction is actually that it seems like the Scapegoat's method for thwarting the other players is always the same (radio room) and there is zero nuance to it... It doesn't matter where the plan is that needs to be thwarted, and it almost doesn't matter where the player is relative to the radio room, because transportation is so fast in this game.

After a few plays, I really like the system. The voting of a person to receive no benefits every round seems very well implemented, and the gameplay has enough simplicity to keep the strategy psychological enough. This has high intensity for sure: there's a big difference for some reason between "one person wins" and "one person loses"!

In certain groups, the game seems to degenerate into tie-breaker bickering, with people simply unwilling to do anything at the end.

One play left me underwhelmed.  Thematically, it doesn't grab me, though it's exacerbated by a mismatch in artwork (brightly colored and somewhat cartoonish) and theme (escape from prison with tasks like "Liquidate a rival gang leader").

One player losing while everybody else wins is intriguing, but I social dynamics make it kind of uncomfortable.  Singling out one person to lose feels like piling on the loser, and the worst kinds of schoolyard bullying.  It's exactly the kind of dynamic that co-ops are good at avoiding.  What's more, the amount of chaos and randomness means that it's frequently a crapshoot who gets out.

an interesting "not my style" co-op boardgame.  i kept feeling that i should like it as we were playing, but ended up fairly ambivalent.  i'm pretty sure that the reason is that, although the game is technically cooperative, it doesn't really feel like it.  it feels more like you have to remain constantly vigilant, aggressively attack other peoples position, while defending your own.  in other words, it's a war game disguised as a co-op.  no thanks.

It's tough to rate this game. I love it from a thematic standpoint, and how cool and different it is. However, it's definitely a game that requires "the right group". I will certainly turn this game down outside of those parameters, but it's such a refreshingly unique a beast. The experience of play can actually be described as cathartic, as you feel like your friendship bonds are stronger after play.

The game can ruffle feathers, and make people can feel left out, or picked on. This is a game for those that like negotiations and backstabbing all while not taking it personally, or at least able to leave those feelings at the table, and if you're one of those, like me, then you'll absolutely love this game!

The game is well balanced between 3 players, with 3 AP each (for a combined 9 actions per round), and 4 players with 2 AP each (8 combined actions per round), but the latter has an advantage in spreading out over the board and being able to use more free actions spaces. That said, after adding in the expansion, I would claim that this game is best with 5 and the addition of the Sucker role.

There are lots of ways to avoid being voted the Scapegoat, and the tips in the rules are spot on. It also helps if you know your fellow players, so that you can play proper mind games on the meta level. I highly recommend this with the right group.

Please note that my copy came with several misprinted cards, one missing card, and three defective tiles (one character and two locations, but Kuznia Gier replaced them with perfect looking components in a timely manner.

This game is quite fun.  I really enjoy the fact that the players determine how difficult the game is based on the way in which they play it.  On that same note, it's better when you're cutthroat and aggressive; if you're too altruistic, the game can still be fun, but you know you're missing out.

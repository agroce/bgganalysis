Superb tactical Napoleonic Wargame using Wellington's Victory (WV) rules. It's the "little brother" of WV and so best training device for the bigger one at Waterloo (WV)!! - Check the Quatre Bras modul of the "La Bataille"-Series. Its a bit similiar and very good for a comparison.

really good system, unfortunately has the French player only few options and practically no chance to win. That is realistically, but a little bit boringly for the Frenchman.

I love this game.  The WV rules are complex and not grouped into subjects that are easy to remember.  I recommend PDFing the rules and searching your iPad during the game.  My wife and I have saved something like 30 minutes per game turn by using searching.  Make your own tables and game turn sequence and then the game is truely great.  The map graphics are very well considered and the game offers so much more than say the SPI quad game Napoleon's last battles version of Quatre bras.

Wellingtons Victory's little brother. The huge space and time needed to play Wellingtons Victory made it unplayable to me. But this is much smaller has far fewer units and requires so much less space. My only bug bear with thisgame is it becomes a bit tedious moving around the hordes of skirmishers. Otherwise a great wargame.

A sublime and highly playable descendant of the mildly unmanageable Wellington's Victory; simplified miniatures-like system adequately reflects the dynamics of scissors-paper-rock nature of Napoleonic tactics. Clean system is brutal and effective; it will punish the ill informed or unwary.  Not for the casual player; expect to spend about 20 hours between two thoughtful and well matched opponents.   Slightly revised rules.

Confrontation between two of the greatest Marshals during the Napoleonic period.  Battle of Quartre Bras, prelude to Waterloo.  The game uses the Wellington's Victory system and I have that game too.  Joe Bolkoski is my favourite game designer.  Looking at the map, you'll find how elegant the production back at those days could be even for a magazine game.

In principle a very clever game system, impressive for its simplicity compared to La Bataille while retaining much of the effects. Formations work pretty cleanly, the morale system shows units routing long before they are all dead (often not the case with detailed games).  The cavalry charge zone rule is inspired.

Main problem are of course the skirmishers, who really need reining in.  Also, these days the counters (in particularly the French ones are pretty unevocative and hard to read.  Play progresses without any though about formation integrity. I accept that's how it worked 35 years ago, but it's a bit behind the times now. Still, if the counters were easier to read this would be a 7.

The little brother to Wellingtons victory. The game system which sort of worked in WV didn't here. I think the skirmishers simply was too unrestricted. Also the map grid made play strange, the main allied defense line lay across the grid making it impossible to set up a line without exposing the flanks of your unit. I really tried to like the game.

My favorite Napoleonic tactical game. A terrific game system that forces the proper use of combined arms tactics in order to win. The system is a streamlined version of "Wellington's Victory". Not a simple game but not overly difficult. The assymetrical sequence of play keeps both players constantly playing game. It is tough going for the French because Ney sat doing nothing until the afternoon and began his attack when Allied reinforcements were well on their way. A great simulation and a lesson in Napoleonic period tactics.

A great way to introduce someone to this game's older and bigger brother "Wellington's Victory" as it is simplified somewhat in the rules and is a fraction of the size. Lots of colorful and interesting units, but your options as the French are limited by the map in that the only flanking option you have against the Anglo-Allied right flank is through the forest. (Compare the map from this game to the map from CoA's game on the same subject and you'll see a lot more open ground on the other side of the forest.) The game can really have some tense moments for both sides, but especially for the Allies as they await those precious reinforcements. I should dig this one out and give it a play again; it's been over 20 years since I've played it!

Another Balkoski great. French cavalry racing around the staunch British squares etc etc. Unlike Mr Balkoski's other efforts this one actually has a CRT (based on the Wellington's Victory system) but his other trademark - completely unwinable for one side - remains intact. I defy anyone to win as the French - who cares though, the journey is where all the fun is, not the destination. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
GREAT game - uses the system from Wellington's Victory at a more managable level. (Also the Battle of Monmouth system - except NvW has the 'full' cavalry rules and the formation tactics for the defenders of a cavalry charge.) Yes, for one of the few times in wargaming, cavalry is more than a mounted trooper - they change the battle as they did in real life. If troops are not prepared, the cavalry charge will sweep them from the field. Thus, the formations change to square is their only hope. But do they have the morale to stay on the field as they check to see if their compatriots will make the change? Does their leader have what it takes to get them in square? And when the threat of the cavalry is met, does the enemy have cannons in range to blow holes in the now massed troops? Lots of play here, and very exciting! Only drawback - the skirmish rules can get 'gamed' as an opponent may try to do the 19th century version of going to gorillia tactics. But house rules (one skirmish point per regiment, and x points per brigade) can overcome that easily. A VERY good game, and a great intro / prep game for Wellington's Victory!

The battle of Quatre Bras, using the 'Wellington's Victory' system, and can be a great introduction for it. A manageable, single map treatment of the battle using a very miniatures oriented set of rules. Counters are a little busy but nice enough, and the map is great late-SPI art. The burden of attack is definitely on the French, and this one-sided situation lends itself to solo play. F2F games need the better player as the French for the same reason. The system lets you play miniatures on a map, complete with cavalry charges, clouds of skirmishers, leaders roaming the field bucking up the troops. Great stuff, almost more fun than 'WV' if only because it's more playable (and more likely to be pulled out).

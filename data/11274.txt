GBoH combines with the Mongols to give you some utterly unbalanced battles. To be fair, there is a suggested method to balance them, but I'm not sure I'd want to play them again in any case. It's an experience seeing the uber-Mongol horde - highly manoeuverable, bow-wielding, heavy cavalry - in action, but not an one to set your heart racing with the tension of it all.

Based on solitaire play of The Indus and Liegnitz.

Interesting game but it feels like you have too much control here especially as the Mongols. Just attack, withdraw, regroup, attack again. 

More and smaller battles would have been nice.

RATING: 6
This tenth installment of the Great Battles of History series was extremely welcome to me because it dealt with an area of history with which I was woefully uninformed. Fortunately, I was able to play it several years ago before I took a brief excursion in Poland prior to an informal teaching engagement in Minsk, Belarus. 

I enjoyed this game because the four scenarios seemed very different. The Leignitz scenario was as deceptive at first glance as the situation must have seemed to the Teutonic Knights. The knights seem incredibly formidable, but they just get worn down quickly. Even with the Wenceslas reinforcements (optional), this is an incredibly challenging scenario for the Europeans. We also tried the rockets (optional) once and that was pretty random. 

One of the strengths of this game might also have been its weakness. Since these battles were largely dependent on mounted units, the battlefields chosen were, of necessity, rather flat. Well, so are the maps in this game. They aren't very interesting at all--minimalist at best. Yet, they are functional in allowing lots of maneuverability. And, naturally, that's where the Mongols become most interesting.

RATING: 7
I've only played the smaller Ayn Jalut scenario so far, but my overall impressions are favorable. The leader activation system makes the games of this series manageable, despite the large number of units. What makes the game UNMANAGEABLE are the large number of conditional markers that the units inevitably accrue...  and I ran out of markers even in THIS, the smallest of all scenarios! An extra countersheet of markers should have been included. That little gripe aside, this is a good game. The production values are great as usual for GMT. The counters are works of art, and the sparse, minimalist maps are pleasing to the eye. 

Due to the micromanagement and counter clutter, I am inclined to believe that this game might actually work better in online play than on the table (something I rarely say, as I'm partial to table play). All that aside, I like the game.

The battles are a whirling contest of cavalry. Mongols are understandably favored, but Berg and Herman thankfully decided to cover the battles that the Mongols almost lost, such as the Indus, and the great Mameluke victory at Ayn Jalut. Liegnitz is mostly a walkover though. In the end, this game is not balanced enough for me to keep it. Simply put, I own better games that will see more play.

I like the GBOH series, but I rated this one lower for SBGOH play than the others because: Lots lot of die rolling for archery(yes I know it can't be helped considering the massive bow armed armies..but I am talking Simple here)...annomolies like engaged units moving around immune to missile fire, many units ganging up to fire at one poor target, and the never ending supply of arrows for shower fire units...

 I will re-rate after  I play the GBOH version

RATING: 3
High movement factors allow cav to run rampant without any interdiction (as long as they stay out of the enemy's frontal hexes, the enemy just sits there and admires the manuvering...weird).  C&C seems much too high here as the high MFs also allow units to pull out of combat and recover far easier than earlier entries of the series (must be the amazing discipline, along with primitive radio communications?).  The stronger army can strike a flank and eliminate much of it and then pull back behind a defensive screen as they reconstitute themselves.  No dead, no wounded!  Rinse, repeat.   Between equal players, the stronger force should never lose in this game, and a wargame that plays out with a forgone conclusion isn't much of a game...maybe this is why the series seems popular with solitaire players. The pretty bits, the nice presentation, the interesting game-specific rules and the interesting setting would have garnered a high rating if I hadn't made the mistake of playing it.  I'll pass on the expansion.

RATING: 7
Mongols!  GBoH on Mongols vs. Crusaders...a great combination.  It requires a test to the system's adaptability to accomodate the special Mongols capabilities to storm the fields of war.  Although the rules are quite complete in themselves, the order of the writing really needs some "shake-up".  Some rules are hard to absorb, especially if you are a novice.  The gameplay does go smooth once you master the rules and learn when and how to read the tables in the play aids.  The time to finish even a short game, even as was told to last 2 hours only, may go way beyond.  It is possible to have both sides to take a relax stance and not engage in battle, but the imbalance in forces of both sides might not encourage that.  The system has gone through over 10 games and has been trimmed in many aspects to suit the needs of different time period.

Tons of fun if you like tons of bow-armed cavalry, knights, peasants, and open space.  Nearly indestructable Mongols wipe the steppes but play balance issues can be easily corrected.  Interesting for a while but ultimately very repetitive and not a whole lot of variety.

一个逼真的游戏。GBOH系列作为古代兵棋的翘楚，果然名不虚传。本作很好的展现了当时欧蒙两军的差异，特别是近乎完美的表现出了蒙古军队的战术优势和指挥优势，玩一遍之后就能知道为什么蒙古人能攻无不克战无不胜。不过历史上一边倒的题材总是最难设计的，因此，设计师也采用了很多平衡规则，这些规则如果不用，扮演欧洲军队的玩家将不开心；如果使用，则必然破坏推演的真实性，玩家们该如何抉择呢？

Review based off one FtF playing.

Components are very nice.  Counters depict infantry and cavalry with various looks.  Maps are plain (due to battlefields of the era), but solid.  Player aids encapsule all the key and necessary rules and charts and are easy to reference during game play.  The rules are well written, and while seemingly daunting, flow smoothly in game play.

That said, I am not a fan of the scenarios.  All of them seem to have a distinct imbalance of play - you either crush opponents or get crushed.  There are rules to cover watering down an advantage, but after playing, I'm not sure a slight reduction in Troop Quality will make much of a difference in most cases.  This game, more than others in the GBoH series I have played, suffers from the lack of turns.  Games can drag on for what seems like ahistorical time limits that can be taken advantage of if you have the larger force (i.e. pull back and slowly issue commands to rally troops then go back into the fight).  That said, it also seems very easy to pull forces back from combat to reorganize (assuming your opponent allows this or is busy rebuilding his units too!).  Reaction in some cases is also an issue where your line seems to sit and be whittled away by bow fire (especially if you have none of your own).  Again - just seemed a bit ahistorical where parts of the line sit and do nothing where other parts are heavily engaged and picked apart.

There are several rules that nicley grab the tactics of the day for the Mongols.  In the end I like the look of the game, but am not 100% sold on the feel for the period.  Command and control seems overly capable and certain aspects can be taken advantage of in very gamey ways.  Will reevalute my rating after more playings, but I'm  not satisfied this is the answer for this period.

I played two scenarios extensively...the other two I only fiddled with.  Overall this is almost a brilliant design;  worthy of a 9.5 or maybe a 10.  But the scenarios are so over-the-top imbalanced that I can't say this is the perfect game.  It is a fine study, however...which could easily have provided historically based balancing provisions...but didn't, for whatever reasons.

I have a soft spot for the Mongols, which stems from knowing several people who are very into them, particularly my Anthropology prof in college.  Having some familiarity with their tactics, I really appreciate that this game takes the time to model them.  The first play was rather overwhelming, as both my opponent and I were new to the Great Battles of History series.  The second play flowed much better and more quickly.  The scenarios don't seem to be that well-balanced, but more studies of history.  Still,  I love how the fluidity and flexibility of the mounted troops are modeled.

Lopsided battles? Probably.  Historical? Absolutely.  Fun? Definitively.
Lots of wide open spaces on the maps and just what's needed for sweeping cavalry actions.  Nearly every counter in the box is horse troop related and that's what the game pretty much represents.  If you're looking for matched lines of infantry against each other, look elsewhere.

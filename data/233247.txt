Abstract: 
This is a very streamlined, fast civilization game and it plays quite different than its predecessor. There are less asymmetric civilizations, no discovery, no combat (card) units, no buildings except wonders. Instead, each player has now his own board with 5 cards. Each card represent an action, like moving units, researching technologies, building a wonder, expanding by placing control token on the map, etc. You can, e.g., upgrade one of these card by researching technologies. Each time you play a card, it moves to the left-most spot on your board and all other cards slide to the right. The further the card you play is on the left the less effective it is, e. g., you can only build on grass terrain. So there is an interesting interaction between effectiveness and frequency.
Players can attack each other or trade.
Another big change is the winning condition. There is a race for the 3 random victory condition each game. So, each player has more or less the same strategy.
Barbarians add random encounters which can be quite annoying up to destructive (push-your-luck).

Thoughts:
A New Dawn is a good-looking, quick civ-game. It is easy to learn due to its streamlined and intuitive mechaniccs. However, it can feel quite abstract. Overall, I like the pace. 
I do not like the swingy combat dice roll. The random barbarians are annoying, but they add the most tension to the game - I miss the  player interaction, it could be much more. I like the scoring in theory but it may force all players to do the same strategies to win the race for the victory conditions.

The best Civilization game yet, if the other versions were too long and heavy for you. This was fun right from the start and a game I would not mind introducing to new gamers. It felt very much like a Civ game without being overly complicated.

The innovation here is a 1-5 track where a card in the 1 has a "1" of power. When a card (such as your 5) is played, it slides to the 1 slot, and everything else shifts up. Neat and game-gameable system for selecting and prioritizing actions. Relative to the other new-Civ, I miss the pyramid upgrade system. The game itself, on the board, is an improvement I think. My biggest beef is how noninteractive some of the goals are. As in, "I'm going to jam my science dial, and achieve this objective, and absolutely nothing you do can stop me!" I get how you don't want an infinite-length leader bashing exercise, but I feel like some middle ground could have been met here to cut down on inevitability.

It's inevitably going to be compared to other Civ games including it's predecessor and 'Through the Ages'. The problem is that it's neither of these games and doesn't pretend to be. It's mechanics are completely different and features a 'focus row' of 5 cards that is ingenious and I'm sure will be seen in the future on other games. The Combat doesn't have units and is abstracted through a combination of a focus card, terrain, control tokens, power cards and dice. Some will not like the combat but I think it works quite well for what the game is trying to accomplish. The game moves along very fast and allows for quick decisions while still being strategic and plans for the long term. The board and pieces are well made and look very good for the price. It's very easy to learn how to play and many would consider it a 'gateway' Civ game, the directions are clear and concise while being short and to the point. Only issue with all of the streamlining is the fact that it's a bit abstract with regards to combat and makes building cities and wonders pretty easy, but it's also a game that can be played in 1.5hrs with 4 people. The replay value is there as it's very fun but I'm already begging for an expansion, it will definitely need a few for the long run.

like the core mechanism of action selection, the tech tree, spreading out on the map.

I didn’t like the trade route building which is perfunctory at best. Plus there’s no real sense of danger or pushing for territory. Players just do there thing regardless of each other - and the victory conditions were asking us to do the most boring stuff in the game,

Real disappointment. It distills the civ experience but cuts out the fun. Combat is dreary too

RATING: 7
A good effort at designing a quick to play civilization game. To keep playing time down, sacrifices had to be made, and for example tech trees are not particularly interesting (and not trees at all), but it still gives me a bit of civ-feeling and easily plays in under two hours. I still prefer Golden Ages in the quick-playing civ-niche, but I can certainly see myself playing this again.

RATING: 7
Dang they found a way to fit a Civ game in around 90min... and it still feels like a Civ game!  In doing so, you lose a more significant tech tree, and no one really is that much different throughout the game, but the engine of the game works really well.  I kind of think you really need to draft the map, otherwise it seems like you could get forced into a strategy or way of playing that you don't really want to do (We played the suggested map in our first game, and I was by myself, and encouraged to just mature my cities, but I wasn't really keen on doing that...).  For sure one I would like to play more and could see this one going up in rating.

This has triggered my interest due to its civilization-nature. Both me and my son enjoy the computer-version very much but I´m not sure if it makes a good transit between platforms. I also believe my son and I are on different levels so this might not be a good game to play together so if there isn´t a good solo-version of it I don´t think it is something for us. There is also the issue of a troublesome rulebook not really including everything you know.

RATING: 7.5
It's pretty good. It's a good blend of rapid gameplay and some decent strategic depth. You really only make one key decision per turn, so turns pass by in a snap. The full game takes maybe 90 minutes for 3 players, and along the way there are plenty of interesting decisions and alternate paths to victory.

But there are some gameplay issues. The Civ abilities feel really weak, to the point that it doesn't really matter which Civ you play. (That's in stark contrast to the other Civ game.) And the Civs start a little too far apart, in my opinion, with interaction just a little bit too limited. Until you have high-level techs in the late game, civs just can't do much with each other. That's too bad. 

There is an obvious need for more wonders and more technologies--the game just needs more variety here--but presumably expansions will solve that.

RATING: 4
The art, particularly on the leader sheets is cartoony childish and awful.

The game turns out to be completely underwhelming. It's so abstract that it didn't even feel much like a civ game. While the focus bar is a cool idea, the actual gameplay was unexciting. The 8 nations don't feel any different from each other. Everybody was just kinda doing the same wash/rinse/repeat.
The techs weren’t that differentiated as you moved up the tech levels. And since you can jump from level 1 to level 4, by the end of the game, everyone is mostly at levels 3 and 4 and all the nations feel even more the same. 

Go play Civilization 2010 instead. It's much better.

This was so mediocre, I immediately sold the game away on the same day after my one and only play.

Civ games never quite win me over. I always feel as though I'd rather be playing a space 4x game, typically because I really enjoy exploration and conquest - two elements which seem to get shafted in civilization designs.

This one is at least brisk. It moves along at a good clip and the action focus card row is clever, being very reminiscent of the overlord play in Conan. I also enjoy that there's no real tech-tree or anything to fuss around with.

I do feel that in the sheer speed and streamlining of this game, it doesn't boast too much character. Everything feels very abstracted and it lacks personality. We're left with a game that's fine to play, but not something that's calling my name on the shelf.

(Runthrough - Preliminary) Oh boy, this is a good one. I love the action card selection mechanism and using it as a timing tool in your engine. Very clever. The only downside so far is the set-up is so tedious.

RATING: 7
I suspect this game will really split opinions. Those coming to the table hoping "finally a civ game that plays in less than two hours!" will be disappointed. But those that have no preconceptions may find that this is an interesting area control game. 

The highlight is the shifting card row action selection system. It's a great engine for driving the game. The rest is ok. 

There is not much of a feeling of "epic scale" or advancement of your civ. Sure new action cards do more but it is basically an exercise in euro optimization. It's a rush to the endgame win conditions. 

I'm happy to play again as long as everyone knows to ignore the name of the game!

Very surprised that this feels way more thematic than I would have expected.

This receives the best rating I ever give for a game that I've only played once (7).

A great, quick, civilisation game. It really does feel like you are playing a civilisation game, but the turns are lightening fast and it only takes an hour! My only criticism so far is that it It feels like the real skill is in the competitive setting up of the board rather than in actual gameplay. Some of the leaders maybe unbalanced, but I don't mind that so much as the game is so quick you can get two or three games in in one session, and the luck will balance out.

Played this solo to get a feel for the rules. What struck me was how this felt like FFG standard fare, with lots of text bloating the complexity. It also felt strange how easy it was to build cities without any significant costs. It simply took an action to build a city. The whole action system is built on the terrain of the map and I found that very intriguing.

The goal system for winning reminded me very much of Suburbia, and made me think this wasn't as 4x as I thought it would be.

Without getting a play in, I am tentatively scoring this a 2 from my 5 point rating scale, which is an ok game but ultimately forgettable in a year or two. But I think it has the potential to be as high as a 4. Which is a good game with top award billing potential. Right now I feel like I've been handed the engine of a what could be a good game. But it's just that. A good engine. What it needs is a bit more variety as there seems to be little difference in terms of abilities and race powers. Unfortunately I don't think it will ever be a 5, which is a boardgame classic, since I think the decision to frontload a lot of the complexity on the cards and the differing cost/benefits to juggle per action makes it a very inelegant design and prevents it from truly breaking the mold.

RATING: 6
The hook of the computer game will likely get a ton of people to play this game, I know that is what happened to me with the last iteration of Civilization. The appeal of a more streamlined version brought me back to retry the series, since the last version was another typical Fantasy Flight mess of mini cards that pile up all over to a mess of little effect.

The action, card sliding system is fantastic, but the rest of the game just wasn't that interesting. Moving control dots about, adding cities, and the better techs just never felt like anything was happening. The goals created some scripted play that caused the game to grind and stall at the end (ie. nobody would buy the top wonder and allow the next player to have access to the one needed to win).

It was an OK experience, and I would it was one of Fantasy Flight's better attempts, but in the end, flavor trumped quality gameplay.

I like the card row mechanic, I think it’s smooth and streamlined, just the way I like my games.

Overall the experience is a bit blah though. Some leaders and combinations are insanely good. Some are completely worthless. Not sure what the balancing intent was...leaving it up to players to figure out through diplomacy? There is virtually no catchup mechanic so if you have the misfortune of neighbouring a warmonger, it’s not going to be a very pleasant game. 

In typical FFG fashion, the contents are best described as “lean”. Enough to get some basic variability but likely requires an expansion to feel “complete”.

RATING: 6
An abstracted Civ game that focuses on the area control aspect more with gaining control of areas around your city, barbarian that move around, neutral cities to trade/take over along with opponents cities

The game revolves around an action track in which actions move down a chain and the longer you wait, the more powerful an action is. Tech is largely abstracted out of this game as all you do with it is upgrade your action cards. There is also no culture (points), only global objectives and the first person who achieves them wins.

An interesting take on it, as I believe most civ games that try to streamline the different aspects tend to focus more on the tech tree and removing the area control. This one does the opposite. However I person favor a more developed tech tree so it's not my favorite of the faster civ games

Thematically similar to Civilization games on the PC, A New Dawn is a nicely streamlined version of the original games that I believe is easy to enjoy for more casual gaming groups who can appreciate mechanics which aren't too overly complex, yet still maintaining a variety of strategic options. 

There's definitely potential for more content to be added via expansions to make the game feel more complete, but as it is, I think this one will stand the test of time where replay-ability is concerned

Many interesting things and I like the card strength, based on how high they are mechanism. But there is not much player interaction, players are just in their own zone, planning to do most with their one card activation each turn. 

Some of the Winning options are boring, should be more alternatives. Can drag along, but I guess that will improve as you play more times.

I found the basic concept of the game enjoyable. Like so many others, I enjoyed the focus row mechanic. Like so many FFG games though, this too suffers from some balance issues.

The wonders seem awfully out of balance. The military wonders are a lot more powerful than the others. The others have just a couple of good wonders while every single one of the military wonders is good.

The focus card which you research are an another interesting part. In these too, only the military card is a direct upgrade on every level. The other types tend to have better options earlier levels. The Research type cards for example. For the most powerful effects, the second level is just  the best. You get a trade token you can use either to boost your research or another action. The level 3 Research card on the other hand gives you a resource. It's only good if you're going to build a wonder. Otherwise, you get no benefit from it. And since the military wonders are the ones to go for, it's not necessarily a good power. Similar things are true for the other focus cards.

Defending is almost impossible. The attack bonuses are so great that the defense bonuses don't help much for defending. With Flight technology and Pentagon wonder, it just becomes ridiculous. You can do three attacks anywhere on the map and there's no penalty for attack. Only reinforced mountain towns might have some hope defending against that but not even them. The player attacking with Pentagon and Flight in 5th slot, gets +10 to attack (+5 from Flight's position, +3 flat bonus from Flight, +2 from Pentagon) which is the same as a mountain town's defense bonus without any reinforced culture tokens. But if the attacking player has any more bonuses like Joint War or another military wonder, the defending player is at a disadvantage. He can burn his Trade Tokens on the Military card but since the attacker gets 3 attacks, the attacker has some leeway on that too. The situation easily snowballs in favor of the attacker.

In the end, I would enjoy the game a lot more if cultural and economic ways would be equal to the military strategy. But as it is, the game will always default to the military strategy.

Very good on first couple playthroughs - but two-player mode can be a bit boring with the preset map. Mechanics wise, looks like a mashup of the best features of Catan (territory/map management) and 7 Wonders (tech tree advancement) while retaining what we love about Civilizations. Could be a bit more on-theme with more advanced faction mechanics though.

New Dawn is a civilization board game where you expand, gather resource and go to war. The card focus system is the most interesting mechanic here. Cards will slowly move up the track to a "level 5" actions, but you can only take that action if it has been five turns since that was last taken. This creates a unique efficiency puzzle, encouraging you to focus on other actions while the one you desire "charges." As a Civilization game, though it doesn't have some of what is expected. Culture, influence, and military are all represented by the same token. The game is less about building an empire that excels at something (tech/military/economy/etc) and more of a fluid civilization that grows to smaller and shorter term goals. Now knowing what the game is, I am eager to approach it again. It is easy to want something different from the game than what it is. On a side note, there is unfortunately a handful of rules that need memorization and are not streamlined into the core mechanics.

Nie jest to gra nadzwyczaj głęboka; faktycznie - prostsza i szybsza od poprzedniczki. Tury gracza są szybkie, a główny pomysł z zagrywaniem kart dobrze się sprawdza. Do tego kilka ciekawych pomysłów (ruch barbarzyńców, niezależne miasta, dyplomacja) i co ważne - brak efektu kuli śnieżnej czy kingmakingu.
Boję się jedynie o regrywalność (mała pula celów końcowych, jednakowe talie kart akcji dla wszystkich).

Tentative rating. What's clever is really clever--the focus board and its interaction with the map is truly excellent. That said, the early game is vastly more compelling than the late game, the techs are workmanlike but uninspired, and I somewhat doubt that the game could withstand much player conflict--though I'm open to being proven wrong.
The absurd theming of so-called "civilization" games is also starting to get to me. Having Montezuma conquer Buenos Aires (right next door to Mount Everest and Geneva) while erecting Big Pen out of mercury using pottery is... something.

RATING: 8
Only after two play through's so far but I (and everyone I've played with) have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Though there are a number of things to learn, once the game is going the turns flow well and everything becomes intuitive. The focus cards are brilliant ways to focus player turns (pardon the pun) and also serve to create tough but meaningful decisions for players each and every turn. 

Only a couple of things held me back from a rating of 9. Firstly it feels like some of the key components of the game lack some variety. For example, each game uses only 3 f the 5 possible achievement cards as goals to win. With only two games there feels like an element of sameness to those options, even though there are still 2 options to trigger each card. Similarly, The wonder options feel a bit limited considering that every 4 payer game will have the whole wonder deck in the game for each type, and for three players you only take out 1 card for each type. The randomization rule based on age means that even after 2 games I have a good idea of what wonders to expect and when to expect them to come up. I don't expect either of these to be a big problem though as they are very likely candidates for expansions. 

The two real problems I have with the game that aren't as easy to see future fixes for are the fact that the game feels like it can end abruptly, and also that there seemed to be almost no interaction between Civ's until very late game. Again, I've only played two games and both were with the suggested learning map, so this may not be a major issue when drafting maps, but I'd definitely like it more if there were Civ's interacting from earlier in the game, and also if the last objective felt like it was more of a struggle or contest between Civ's to achieve.

Having said all of that, these are minor nitpicks to an otherwise great game. I'll be happy to keep bringing this game along to group nights regularly and I expect it to get many playthroughs. I'd recommend this as a pick up for anyone that enjoys deep strategy, competitive empire builders, or as a light euro style resource manager.

2017-12-11 - I've only played this game one time with 3 players, but I really enjoyed it. I love the way the focus cards work and the process of upgrading them is great.

Never played a civ game ever and yet very impressed with the system. Focus card track / upgrading cards was very fun and clever design. Def best part of the game. Components were lackluster and combat system seemed quite dated. Turns were quick but the game didnt really seem to be FUN... but more satisfied in the progress you were doing. meeeeehhh.... that isnt generally ok but was tolerable in this game. I do wish FFG hadve a little more time in the components. Played 3 player once = with rules explanation right under 2 hrs. I am sure 2 player could be hr once game is familiar.  Would def like to play again and explore the system more.

Presentation:  looks pretty, despite most of the board being flat cardboard than a "dudes on a map" look.

Rules and rulebook:  not a bad rulebook for an FFG game... until you get midway through the game and try to figure out things like what happens when a barb movies into a city state, are caravans friendly spaces, etc.

Gameplay:  I played about 6 games so far.  Its fun, and i would play again.  Turns are pretty smooth, but it feels aggression is more encouraged, and having to calculate defense values can be tedious.

Pretty easy to teach right away (I teach board games every week for the past decade).

Replay:  the modular map method is great.  You pretty much see most of the game after your first play.  The different wonders are great for changing up play.

The leaders though... eh, they can be powerful, but I was hoping they would be more varied.  Egypt's "cost 1 less" just feels lazy despite it being kinda fun to wonder spam.

Its a good slightly-shorter 4x style game.  I may recommend looking at Nexus Ops for an Explore/Expand/Exploit/Exterminate game as well, what i feel is the closets comparison to a mid-weight game like this.

Overall, the feel of the game is that it was rushed and not well-tested, and DESIGNED to suck unless you bought an expansion (to be released...) in other words DO NOT BUY YET.

Lemme explain.
The mechanics when you get resources or goods, is cumbersome. In summary: When you build a city or place a control token that squashes a hex containing a resource and you have to put it apart; but it counts as 2 when buying a wonder that makes use of that resource. When you score for mature cities you get 1 good. When you caravan to an enemy city, you get 2 goods to be placed at your choice. When you caravan to a city state you get 2 goods  to be placed at the card of that icon. Blergh. Impossible to remember.

Placing a wonder requires you to sift through multiple markers and compare fiddly icons to finally get the corresponding token to slide under your city. Each city can have only 1 wonder. What? yes, only one.

Placing a city must be at most 2 hexes from an existing city. What that means is still debatable. is 1 hex the same as adjacent? 

Playing with 4 gamers took 3 hours. Downtime is horrible, even when you think outside your turn there's too much to process. Maybe we are just slow.. each game 3 cards are central, each with 2 goals, you get a random civ each game, with specific powers, and you need to figure out the most efficient way to get one of each of those card goals, and in what order.
There is a lot of choice in between each of your turns. Keep track of the phase the barbarians are in. Loot or keep city state. The end game is neither a climax nor does it fall flat.
I suggest you try it a few times first before you buy, but only with 3 players.

EDIT: played a second time, again with 4. There seems to be a more "meh" feeling about this game. Considering the promise of Civ, and the invested 3 hours (again), I expect a lot more. There are only 5 goal cards, from which you choose 3 at random. That's not a lot. The game feels like a straightjacket because you can do whatever you like but you can only win if you go straight for the goals and ignore everything else. Combinations like the lighthouse + urbanization are killers.

The guy who won didn't even use his power (it was English I believe), the leader actions are too weak. I had France, that does not give ANYTHING before you build your first wonder.

I proposed cutting the goal cards in two, and draw 6 halves at random, but people went bleak in the face shouting No more Legacy! One of the goals is 8 cities, that is just impossible. You can build 7 cities (apart from your starting capital) but that will cost you so many actions  you won't get to reach any other 2 goals. I would lower that to (7) cities.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

While not wowed, I found it engaging and interesting. As usual, I got distracted building up my tech and forgetting the end game winning conditions in the process and fared poorly. I'm not sure I like the recommended setup that has  a river cutting off a good portion of the board in three player. The central mechanic is quite clever. Still not the perfect CIV game but I'm not sure that exists or even can exist. :-)

Gives you the feel of a Civilization game, similar to the computer games. It is very streamlined, playable in an evening. Not very confrontational, but that is good for players who prefer that.

It has a lot of replayability do to the variety of civilizations and the map building. The different goals add little but not much to the variability of the game since there are only five of which three are used every game. Some of the wonders feel a little weak, just like some of the civilizations (mainly France, Egypt and Rome). The game feels like a very short version of the video game. Sometimes the victory conditions are achieved in very rapid succession which results in a sudden ending of the game. Overall it is a good game which certainly will see more plays.

I'm not a fan of civ games, so I was hesitant going into this.  First play with setup and rules took way too long for my tastes, but I could see the second play getting under the two hour mark, now that the rules are familiar.  Focus row was great, seemed like things were pretty well balanced.  I could maybe be convinced to play again (which is a good thing, considering my bias).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In one play, the thing that struck me most about this game is just how damned generic was the experience.  This game lacks character.  It checks off all of the civ game checkboxes but nothing has any zest or flavor.  We start with asymmetric civilizations (Sumeria, France, Egypt, etc.) but the unique player powers are slight and subtle. The board is a dull looking nowhere land with cities randomly dotted along it (Carthage next to Brussels, for example).  While the examples could continue, nothing much excites here.

The core of the game-play is an action selection mechanism where the longer you wait before doing an action the more powerful it becomes.  This was the most interesting aspect of the game: it was rather puzzly.  But in the end, it strongly disincentivized any kind of specialization.  You can;t do 3 military actions in a row because the game basically penalizes you for doing so.  SO you are constantly forces to do things you don't want to do.  

Given the generic implementation of the theme and the frustrating action selection mechanism, I'm not sure this is a good fit for me; but I'll start my rating at 7 until I get more plays in.

This isn't my kind of game. I thought I would be more into it because TI4 showed me that I don't hate all territory control games. The focus bar mechanic is super interesting and cool, but I'm a little disappointed with the choices of actions. The tradeoff between building a city or building a wonder seems difficult when combined with wanting to build your city on higher level terrain to keep it better protected. The economy/caravan action also disappoints; instead of a bunch of unique promissory notes, I wish there was something else there.

Just 1 play with three.  This is a good Civ game, but for me it doesn't replace any other Civ game I own, and definitely doesn't meet the 60 - 120 min time slot.  Our first game took 5 hours.  One hour to setup and teach, and 4 hours to play.  Now after several plays (with the same group) I could see this gaming clocking in at 3 hours at best, but then I'd rather play Clash of Cultures or Nations.

That being said I do like the focus system of this game and the variable/multiple end game objectives to win.  Everything seems well balanced. The tech tree seems like it could get a little stale after a few plays.  So although I would definitely play this again, I don't feel the need to own it.

RATING: 4
Somehow worse than its predecessor. In an industry with a variety of great Civ games, this really feels like a waste of a design. The focus row is an interesting mechanism, and kind of reminds me of the river from Conan (The main mechanism I enjoyed in that game), but the rest of the game is a straight-up Euro with a Civ theme as complete window dressing. I really feel like this was released for licensing reasons rather than to boast a new and interesting design in the Civ genre. I guess this is a small example of how Asmodee sees the gaming world now...

RATING: 7.8
LE jeu auquel j'aimerais attribuer une note de 10, tellement le jeu en PC a eu / a une importance dans ma vie. Effectivement, non seulement je joue abondamment à Civilization sur PC depuis 1992 (à l'exception de Civ III, qui est sorti alors que j'avais 21 ans - une époque où j'ai moins consacré de temps aux jeux), mais cette série englobe la plupart des rares jeux PC auxquels je me suis adonné. 

En version "boardgame", ce jeu est l'un des premiers que j'explore sous le thème du développement de civilisations. Je n'ai pas essayé [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77130/sid-meiers-civilization-board-gameT.B.G]son prédécesseur[/url], ni d'ailleurs [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/25613/through-ages-story-civilization]Through the Ages...[/url], notamment à cause de la contrainte "temps" (ces jeux étant relativement longs).

[i]Pour l'instant, je n'ai exploré ce jeu-ci qu'en version solo[/i]. J'y vois des éléments qui m'accrochent naturellement (du fait que j'aime les jeux PC), mais aussi une certaine superficialité (combats plutôt banals, conditions de victoires pas assez diversifiées, améliorations scientifiques un peu simplistes, absence de religion et de développement urbain, volet diplomatique plutôt léger et dont je ne suis pas certain qu'il fonctionne bien à deux joueurs...) qui me laisse un peu sur mon appétit. 

Par ailleurs, si la mécanique "Focus card" est intéressante en soi, elle n'est pas sans me rappeler quelque peu celle présente dans Scythe; un jeu pour lequel je n'ai pas éprouvé une impression très positive... Toutefois, ici, il semble que le positionnement des cartes ennemies peut avoir une incidence un peu plus grande en termes d'interactions: course pour la construction de merveilles; potentiel d'attaque...)

Une ou des extansions pourra sans doute bonifier l'ensemble et je serai assurément preneur. Pour l'instant, ma note ne peut certainement pas atteindre les sommets, bien que je suis suis enthousiaste et impatient de l'essayer et de le réessayer en multijoueurs.

Après une partie solo (2017-12-24): 7.8/10

RATING: 3
I liked a lot of stuff going on with this game, but the combat spoils it, both in attacking and being the attacked. I've played this with 2, 3, and 4 players to test it out, and I can confidently say this is not a game for our playgroup.

It does a lot of things right - the turns are fast, the theme is right on with Sid Meier's Civilization 6, building up your cities is fun, and mechanics surrounding tech and diplomacy are really cool and fresh. The Focus Bar is awesome and I want to see more games that use it.

I wanted to like this game for all the reasons above, but the rules around combat favor attacking so much that it left my group disappointed. The rules for attacking either ruins the fun (including slowing down the game with tons of forgettable rules) or homogenizes the strategy. However, we don't like aggressive games, so if you're into games like Kemet you may be interested in this.

RATING: 7.7
Have 4 plays including one 2-player and the rest 4-player.

Right from the start we 'missed' a few rules (more on that below) so the first 2 games were choppy...fun, but choppy.  Once we correctly applied and understood the rules (game 3) the gameplay began to flow.

The rules: It's not that the information wasn't there but some important information is buried and not (in my group's opinion) easily referenced.  This resulted in more work than my group usually wants when trying out a new game.

The game:  We really liked it.  It plays well and at a brisk pace with a good amount of meaningful choices. We've not had a runaway victor and we enjoyed how the tension continues to build right until the end but without dragging on.  Important note: If your group does not do well with confrontational games then A New Dawn will not go over well.  Attacking/defending (just like the computer games) is very often necessary for your civilization to grow AND win the game.

Others have commented on their enjoyment of the Focus row mechanic which I echo as well.  Also, like others, we felt that this game is made to accommodate expansions (eg. more possible victory conditions, V-??? Focus Cards, terrain, wonders, Nationalities, and so on).  

As is, this is a darn good light-ish civ game.  Expansions would certainly give it more staying power though.

It will be inevitably compared to a civ game experience, both video and board, and it may fall short of people's expectations in both given a 30-min-per-player game with abstracted combat and a limited tech tree can't meet that. But when looked at as a standalone game, it does some pretty good things. It’s really a race game - minimising the number of turns to get to the victory condition and forgoing the natural inclination to do everything else that seems natural to improve your civ. The focus row (a neat concept!) encourages you to be an all-rounder across the 5 activity spheres, but winning the game requires you to specialise, so your main decision focus is how often to go back to the well in the spheres you need to concentrate in – the longer you don’t use them, the more powerful they get! The game will never provide an epic experience (it's really quite Euro) but there are different victory combinations and different terrain to manage each game. On the downside, most of the victory conditions centre around the focus card that allows you to build cities or wonders, making each game feel roughly the same, and focused (ahem) on how often and when to use that card. I wish these cards were more balanced in importance, and that the victory conditions were varied enough to provide different game feels. I’m not falling into the trap of buying the inevitable expansion to improve longevity which should have been there to begin with, but we will get some decent play out of it as it is before moving on.

Not sure if 6 or 7.. Only one play so far and its easy and plays quick. Its not the most interactive (despite conflict) and Im not sure if it has the legs for a lot of games. The main problem is that its quite generic - a card may be called "Nationalism" or "Urbanisation" or whatever, but thats just a name. A lot in the game is abstract. It is a good simulation of the later Computer-Civilisations, which were increasingly generic as well. But yes, would play again if asked, but not a buy yet. Other games have grabbed me more.

A new iteration on Sid Meier's Civilization. FFG.

"A New Dawn's focus system is utterly smooth, providing potential actions and regulating your expansion, development, and aggression in very clever ways. Unfortunately, the game concludes far too abruptly, robbing it of that third-act struggle between players. It's still good, but the price for wrapping up in one to two hours is that the third hour probably would have been the most interesting one."

A very dry, mechanial game. I had expected much more and I'm disappointed. There's no civ-feeling, in fact, no emotions at all. You simply play the game by moving some cards from the right to the left, do a little on the map, and one player wins. I had the same feeling when playing Scythe, which is a hit with many other players. I'm obviously not the target group for this type of games.

n abstracted civilization game. To keep the playtime down to couple of hours, many things are condensed, and things like combat is very abstract. However, you still get a lot of strategy bang for your buck.

I really like the concept behind the focus row. To get the maximum out of your cards requires turns to recharge. A key is to observe when you can use a card with less than "full" charge or use trade goods to make up the difference. 

Takes a while to explain initially - people can get lost mainly because there are so many options to cover, but that may just be me learning how to explain the game. However, it is not complex, procedurally and everyone catches on in a few turns. It does help that there isn't much interaction between civilizations until the mid game so they begin to differentiate and players learn how to manage them. 

My plays so far have been interesting, and I think it has a place when you want a lighter and quicker civilization game. 
I don't consider it a issue but the end game can revolve into trying to prevent the next play from winning while getting ready for your push, or abruptly if someone can satisfy two cards at a time, but you can see it coming. It is a game where you need to keep your eye on the target.
I would like some more pairings of victory cards and wonders so there were more to choose, but that is a possible expansion.

It's a great game for a civ builder that's also very accessible to players who want a lighter game.  It scales for player count really well.  I've played 2 player with a few different friends and have always come out enjoying it.  The 3+ player game is really great because you feel like you're playing an epic civ-builder, but the game is done within 2 hours.  It's also easy to track who is in the lead, so you don't feel cheated by someone pulling off a surprise win 2 hours into playing it.

The good:
Focus row concept is really well done.  It's both intuitive, easy to use, and adds interesting strategic depth to the game.
Aggressive players can be aggressive without tilting the whole game.  The rewards are good for winning fights, but also don't really hurt defending players too much.
If a player wants to hole up, they can, but it will keep them from some advantages and stopping other players from taking the lead.
Love the game artwork, and it has the feel of the computer game.
The game is extremely fast paced for a civ type game, this makes it a must play for a group who wants a civ builder, but includes players who don't want a long game (basically my game group).

The bad:
A lot of the game feels almost too abstracted... but this is the trade-off you get for making the game shorter and more accessible.
Some of the artwork feels a little generic to me.
The combat is so abstract, there aren't any minis to move around and enjoy (but combat is so simple it doesn't bog down game play, which is nice. So basically another trade-off for accessibility)
The asymmetric abilities feel both boring, and very unbalanced in a game without experienced players.  Some are very powerful when playing with passive newer players.  This seems to conflict with the very nature of the game being so accessible to learn for newer players.
This is extremely subjective...  but I just feel like the game is missing something, and I'm not even sure what that something is.  I'm hoping possible expansion can fix this feeling.

The focus row is amazing and I want to play with it more.

The late-game king-making ruins the whole experience for me.  Also, early turns are brisk and options wide open.  Later turns start to have more down time and feel more scripted, making the game get more and more boring rather than more and more tense.  I really want the focus row mechanic + tech upgrades layered on top of a different game (that better handles multi-player conflict).

I'd like more tech variety, but what's there is functional.  After a few plays, I think it might start to get repetitive.

I'm cautiously optimistic that this one will be part of our regular rotation.  I like the general feel and aesthetic, although I wish the map tiles (and everything, really) were just a big bigger and more usable/readable.  The game is not overly complex, but there are some subtle rules easily overlooked if you speed through the rulebook.  The first hour of our first play felt stilted, as we all got used to the various actions and started to figure out how to hone in on the victory conditions.

Things I liked:
1.  The game does allow for a very aggressive playstyle, which my group tends to favor.  There are few penalties to failed attacks, and taking over other players' cities/wonders can be a crucial part of your strategy.  Flight is insanely powerful as an aggression-tech.
2.  The game ramps up viciously once players start getting level III and esp. level IV techs.  You really need to be prepared for this.  I like it, because it means that game just will not drag out for much longer at that point (capitals will fall, etc.).
3.  There are lots of fun, fairly simple combos to discover.  Civ power + city-state bonus + wonder bonus = really crazy synergies.  And, again, that leads to a nice ramping-up feeling; the beginning of the game is mellow and slow; at the end, you can be discovering a wonder on every turn.

Things I worry about:
1.  Unbalanced Civ powers (France?). OP level IV techs (but not too worried about this, since the game is a race, after all).
2.  Not feeling any sense of connection to your particular race/empire.  I played as France 2x and never felt like I was the actual French.  The computer game does a much better job of this.
3.  Lack of really exciting, impactful moments in the game.  Unlike Blood Rage (our group favorite), this game lacks excitement.  The most exciting shit happens at the end of the game, and it's usually associated with someone going for the win (which can happen suddenly and dramatically, which I think is cool),

This game has one great mechanic, which makes the somewhat trivial barbarians and fairly similar kingdoms bearable. Each civilization is more defined by how the different players upgrade their civ, as opposed to their starting country. Variable map and some other small variations to provide good replayability. It may not be the best game of 2017, but it's a good streamlined civ game that has a great core mechanic.

From playing a few turns, it feels like a very cleverly streamlined re-imagining of FFG's original Sid Meier's Civ game. Personally, I can't get past the weird thematic disconnect of having real place names appearing randomly on a map representing a fictional world, and building wonders that in reality were built by entirely different cultures. For example, having the Americans be a stone's throw from Seoul and building the Hanging Gardens of Babylon is just odd to me.

Nice 4x game that doesn't overstay its welcome. Has an interesting action selection mechanism that encourages you to not just repeat the same action over and over. It doesn't avoid many of the common problems in this genre, such as being ganged up on, or getting virtually eliminated halfway through the game with little chance of making a comeback.

Very hard to be analytical these days on price. Not that I was ever much good. Civilization is FFG, Kosmos square box, decent bits and presumably a fat licenced passenger on board  But still sub 40 quid.

We played three player and all enjoyed it. There are hints of the usual three player combat/turtling game problems but they have clearly attempted to address some of them.

It scores on five major points. It has moved us well away from woodchopping for hut building to empire and wonder building. It has come up with some very neat action mechanisms. It threw up more interesting strategic decisions and discussions than I have seen in a long while. It has a clever and quick diplomacy/alliance module (seen before but better here). And it is a proper game not an attempt to emulate the PC.

Best bit is the action card/tech tree/terrain panel. You have five action cards/tech abilities at level one.  These can be teched up to level four but there are always five of them, one for each tech tree - culture, science, military, commerce etc. 

The card in the leftmost slot is weak and only works in grasslands. The card in Pod 5 on the right is powerful and works anywhere BUT when you use it, it drops to level one and the other cards shuffle along to the right. Same is true for any card - use and drop, close linkage to map terraiin. Very nice. I see ano operational command system here. Variable utility and variable strength effects in an easy solution, tweakable with due rolls.

Later in the game this gets cleverer still with wonders that let you switch card order,  for instance. And as your tech goes up each card and the combos escalate. Lovely to play. 

There is combat but there needn't be and trade is always a good option. 

Drawbacks are the usual fuzzy FFG rules and rather too many nuances to remember.  They will, at some point, grasp downsizing and elegance. 

Ran about three hours but lots of rules queies that will go away next time.

Same designer as Forbidden Stars that we all like.

Surprisingly good

I didn't think it would be possible to create a CIV Lite, because CIV games are characterized by their epic scale and taking away from that so far always meant, a game that was allegedly a CIV LITE was just a great petender and at best deservedly of the adjective "lite" , but surely didn't deserve the title "CIV". This game succeeds in that regard. It does create a bit  of the scope from heavy CIV games. The Focus bar is a very neat action mechanic, however I agree that the game loses some of its dynamics towards the endgame and slightly overstays its welcome. Admittedly we were influenced by its predecessor and played the technology wheel mechanic wrong, which we noticed about halfway into the game, so the game lasted longer than it would normally have. Still, I think it's slightly too long

A New Dawn's focus system is utterly smooth, providing potential actions and regulating your expansion, development, and aggression in very clever ways. Unfortunately, the game concludes far too abruptly, robbing it of that third-act struggle between players. It's still good, but the price for wrapping up in one to two hours is that the third hour probably would have been the most interesting one.

In general it is an improvement over the previous Sid Civilization game. It is fast and tense. It plays in about 3 hours. It has a nice mechanic that simplifies the pace of the game. I wish the components were more upscaled.

I want to see this action selection system in other games also. Too bad the war mechanics are crap like in most civ games.

Played a couple of games so far with different friends. Works well, although play time was more like 2 1/2 hours (owing to ramp up of understanding of rules). Captures the spirit of the computer game quite. well.

It may be a bit abstracted compared to other Civ games, but it captures the essentials very well. It's streamlined, and turns are quick. It's a nice change of pace from the more in-depth, longer Civ games. It has a welcome spot on the shelf.

The Focus Row is amazing, and is such a cool part of the game.

Medium weight game with a very streamlined gameplay, does a good job preserving overall feel of Civilization. Completely different game from Previous Sid Meier's Civilization board game.

Fun area control game that plays much smoother than the previous version. Art and components are great. Variable leader powers and map creation keep the game fresh. A few fiddly rules to keep track of but it smooths out after a few rounds. Not my favorite of the genre but it captures the Civ feel pretty well.

Different enough from the "other" Sid Meier Civ game to warrant having both.  Lighter play and quicker.

Good but not great. Feels like it needs an expansion to make the game feel "complete".

Empire building race to complete one of two objectives on each of three cards.  The game centers around the most efficient use of a unique shifting five-card action selection system ranked from most to least effective where the spent card goes to the least useful end of the queue.  A lightish game that could almost be an intro to civs.

Typical civ-building game in that you found cities, build wonders, research technologies.  However, much more focus on claiming territory and expanding borders. Trade routes are represented by sending out wagons to city-states and other player's cities.  Military conflict is completely abstract in this version of the game (no military units roaming the board)

First Impressions: Games looks nice on the table and would have fun playing it. Like the idea that repeating the same action makes that action less powerfull, so there is a nice strategic layer to this game. I also like the idea of multiple roads to victory, where you choose which goals to go for.

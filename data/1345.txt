Based on 1 play.  Myself and another guy were first time players for this.  Three others were experienced.  The other FNG won the game and I came 3rd.  It took 4 hours, excluding the rules explanation.  That was too long for me.  I liked the mechanisms, but 2 hours would be my limit with this game - it just wasn't fun enough.

Pretty chaotic with lots of people (but not necessarily in a bad way), seems to work well with 2 (very scalable).  If you enjoy Bohnanza, you should like this one, although this is obviously a more involved game.

(12/07): I don't think there are many games out there with the constant amount of negotiation and trickery present in Traders of Genoa. The movement mechanic is inspired and the random shortening of the game (without the game ending suddenly) puts a unique pressure on the players that I haven't seen in any other game I've played so far.

I certainly enjoy myself when I play Traders of Genoa, but having a player basically decide the game via an unwittingly lopsided trade leaves a sour taste in my mouth at times. I'd probably enjoy this more with a different group of people, but for now, I only care to play occasionally.

This one took a few plays (and a bit of reading here) to "get". Movement rules for the tower and bartering opportunities confused us at first. Once we figured it out, it became a wonderful game.

Wonderful game. At first, when playing
with a bit noncompetetive group it felt little dull and I was dissapointed.

Then I took the game to bunch of friends that were competetive and noisy. And was I impressed.

The game is very good. You don't have a dull moment at any point, there is just enough different ways to score and it keeps all players to the board till the end.

RATING: 6
1st Play: I don't remember it very well, it's been quite a while, but I know that I generally enjoyed the game with fast negotiations and tough to complete goals.

2nd Play: It's been long enough since my first play that I had to relearn the rules. The game is an excellent negotiation game, and I like all of the back and forth trading and banter that happens during the game. It's tough to place a value on some of the spaces and I like that, the tension drives the game. Unfortunately it goes on a little long - with a good group, it runs 2 hours, and the final turn felt a bit anti-climatic compared to the action that happened in the previous rounds. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Good game, very simple and easy rules and great interaction. But this kind of games put a lot of the control on the hands of the players and there is no control mechanism of the game itself to not making a failure of some negociation give the victory to someone sometimes. So it plays well in experienced or reasonable players. In every other way I enjoyed this game very much.

I often enjoy negotiations and bidding as game mechanics, but not pure haggling. I don't like to haggle over the price of something in everyday life and I don't like it as the core of the gameplay in a game either. The restricted movement rules also befuddeled me. Probably a much better game than I give it credit for, but a haggling game just isn't really for me.

Good game. Challenging and fun. Constant player interaction. But...

A trifle long. A trifle fiddly.

Update: this really bogs down in the last round or two as players try to maximise their privilege card holdings.

Still a good game, but its game length and complexity puts it up against the likes of Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence. It just doesn't compare.

3-5(5)

I think this one's a bit long for what it is, and it takes a couple of plays to really understand the negotiation aspects of the game. Namely, that pretty much anything is negotiable. The winning is a bit abstract, in that you can gain as much from selling off your position as the person buying it from you might. And then there's the standard pratfall of negotiation games with people refusing to deal under any circumstance.

Still, I think it's a pretty solid entry for a trading / negotiation game.

I personally like Chinatown better. I've only played this game a few times so maybe with more repeat plays my opinion will change. It seemed that we kept rolling the exact same numbers for the start position over and over again.

My biggest problem is that I don't know what stuff is worth. (am I making a good deal or not? did I just get ripped off? did I rip somebody else off?)

RATING: 7
A good game, lots of options but tough to learn.  The rules are deep and it takes about half-to-three-quarters of a game to figure out.  

A timer is also needed to speed up the deals.  More time was wasted waiting for someone to finish haggling...

My rating may raise on future playings.  It *will* hit the table again...

After hours of research (Traders of) Genoa came up as a strong recommendation for my Settlers of Catan loving gaming crew.  Initial impressions are good, though we needed to play quite a bit to absorb the strategy.

(Traders of) Genoa continues to be fairly well liked. I still think my friends don't understand *everything* can and should be traded (a lot).  Once that happens I may have to update my opinion.

RECOMMENDATIONS: I'd certainly recommend Imperial to Traders of Genoa fans who'd like to add conflict to their Machiavellian economic experience.

After only one play that we had to shorten to get finished, all I can say is that this game has everything going for it. I loved everything about it especially the short and long term planning that was needed. It was a first game so playtime is exaggerated but I could see this game going really, really long. It wouldn’t bother me but it would other players at the table. My girlfriend really enjoyed it though. I’ll go into more details when I’ve got more plays under my belt.

Initial rating is 8. This will rise with more plays I am sure.

I have very mixed feelings about this game. The whole movement system is simply ingenious--Dorn has a way of creating great new mechanics for spatial play. However, the micro-bid system is tedious and creates decision-making paralysis with too much relativity. Frankly, a simple redesign here would solve the problem and make this a wonderful classic.

As most of the Alea Games this game is solid gold. Personally I think this game is slightly better than Puerto Rico because it has a higher level of interaction between players and a constant bargaining mechanism which requires players to have social skills (mine lack occasionally!) and good bargaining skills.Then ofcourse you can win the game in up to 6 or even 7 different ways or combinations of them.

{1 play, 5 player} First play, which is usually tough in a auction-ish game.  I felt like I might be out of it early, as it was slow going, trying to build up resources.  But about a third of the way through, the lightbulb went off (somewhat) and I could see now that this was more of a long haul and not just quick hits.  Then, about the time I started being able to value things, we switched over to a timer to move things along (fine idea) and by the end of the game, I found myself ready to play again.  Unlike other trading games, I actually felt like I was trading for *something* (as opposed to a bigger share of profits, or a coin for a coin, etc), I was trading for strategy, as well as VP's.  I agree with others, however, in that player's agendas are mostly hidden... and really, everything's good, so there may not be much skill to trading, even though it feels like there is.  But I can certainly see where haggling over $5 could drive some crazy - especially since, without a timer, this baby can drag.  Hell, even with a timer.  I think Chinatown and I'm the Boss are more fun (and certainly quicker), but this one's more meaty - or, at least, it felt that way.

First run through was a little weak, I like the interaction in the game, but something seems to be missing. I do think I will like it more as I go, however. As I am looking at the game now, I really think that the "bribing" your opponents is one of the greatest features of any game out there. Its a solid game for trading, secret objectives, and never knowing who will win in the end.

Rating based on just one play.

I think this rating will go up with repeated plays.  The game was always fun, but it started out cautiously as we learned how things worked.  Near the end I started to get a better sense of how to value different goods and alternate ways of approaching the game.

I like other negotiation games like Bohnanza and I'm The Boss!.  Traders of Genoa offers that same trading and negotiation but in a much more complex and deep package.

For one, the values of the goods you trade are not always obvious, so you must figure that out like you do in many auction/eurogames.  There are also many different kinds of resources that score in different ways, as well as resources that convert other resources into different types.  

Second, I liked the mechanic offered to determine what resources would be available in a given round.  This required some thinking ahead to plan/manipulate the path so that it hit the buildings you needed.

RATING: 8
There are so many context and player-specific hidden valuations that negotiating becomes more than just open math.  The rules aren't that hairy overall, but the playtime has an understandable tendency to keep this one off the table. Especially if you're not rolling 4/5 combos to expedite the game!  I don't consider it to be an epic, but I think I've come around to the idea that this game is three hours well spent if it ends up taking that long.  Very curious about playing it with 2.  Best of breed for negotiation games in my book so far. Game system has a tendency to promote overbids among gamers because of EV thoughts: "I can bid 20 to make 30" - well, you actually gave the merchant 20 on everyone else while only gaining 10 yourself!

I am totally unsure how to evaluate this game. I can see the game in the game, if I'm making any sense, but something tells me our game was fairly atypical and a bit bizarre. I think this is an awake game, a caffiene game, so playing it to end a night with soothing music on at the coffeehouse mightn't have been the best way to experience it. Also, losing by $5 tastes a bit bitter...

Interesting auction game that does not require the auction to be played each turn.  Dice roll for starting position detracts from game play, but combination of other mechanics works well.  Game requires a heavy amount of negotiation.  Depending on the play group, this may make the game run long, or may result in a less enjoyable experience if players are not communicating.

A játékostársam hívta fel a játék végén a figyelmemet arra, hogy a licitáló mechanizmus (a torony) mennyire hasonlít a Goában látott licitálásra. Ez igaz. A különbség csak az, hogy a Goa sokkal több, mint puszta licit, a Genoában meghatározóbb elem a licitálás. Jó játéknak tűnik, de volt olyan elem, amit alig használtunk (tulajdon jelölők)... Szívesen játszanék még vele.

This game is haunting me.  I can't find the right group to play this with.

Update: 7-22-07.
Finally played this game and it was a lot of fun.  I thought the game would be pretty hard to pull off since it is a pure negotiation game.  I am just glad I was wrong.  I completely enjoyed the game.  This is even when we played the game wrong since I messed up on how long the game is suppose to last.  We played 3 times more rounds than we were suppose to.  We ran out of privilege cards and money.  I had to pull out poker chips to cover the difference.  At any rate I am very much looking forward for the next game.
Initial Rating: 8

Update: 27 Nov 2007
Played this game with 4 players and it doesn't seem to work at all.  Too many times that people didn't really want anything and it sucks to be that person that didn't get anything for being the tower player.  The game certainly seems to go a bit too long for me even with the right rules.  It seems like the game only works with 5 players.

I just don't get it.  I've played this game 4-5 times and I can't understand why any path is better than another, or why I should do one thing instead of another on my turn.  It's like being lost for 90 minutes only to find out someone won, but there's no clear reason why.

Note - when teaching, make sure to clarify *all* the rules for negotiations.  You have to make nice in the beginning, otherwise people won't trade with you later.  I like all the bargaining that goes back and forth, plus all the different ways to score points/make moolah.

Picked this one up for half off and have only played once so far.  Unfortunately it was just a two player game, which just doesn't seem to work too well for this style of game.  I do however like the gameplay and how it functions.  Plenty of negotiating, which I normaly like so I am excited to try this one out with more players.

I must say that this is my newest favorite game.  It's been on my want list for awhile, but finally learned the rules playing a three player game.  It really didn't come alive until the next evening when we played with five players.  Wow!  What great player interaction!  Great ways to negotiate and squeeze every last ducat from your opponents.  We were loud, loud, loud, and great fun was had by all.  One player already purchased a copy from BBG Marketplace, another says he "needs" it, and I will continue to wait patiently for a reprint, playing their copies every chance I get.  So many options, so many potential strategies to try, and so much enjoyment.  Can't wait to play again.

Finally got my first game in, and it went better than I was expecting!  Those who played it seemed to enjoy it, and I personally can't wait for the next game.

Right now it's an 8, but I suspect that might go up with repeated playings.

****UPDATE****
Played this a couple more times, and it's always been really fun.  We've even got the playing time down to a reasonable level (about 2 hours, without teaching time).  I always manage to lose pretty terribly at this game, but I always have fun playing it.  That's the mark of a solid game, I'd say.

RATING: 6.5
After first play: Rules have to be the near epitome of convoluted English. It must be easier to be concise rather than  repeating the same point twice with equally cumbersome language. As a result we struggled.

Eventually launched into the game and got to grips with it. The game isn't that hard, why did the rules try to make it so? Fundamentally this game relies heavily on player interaction. You must broker deals to complete your orders and deliver letters. It is not sufficient to wait until your go to hope to do your deals then. 

My group are cut throat, there is no cooperation if there is the possibility that the other player will benifit a penny more out of a deal. As a result I think the game thrives on a more friendly cooperative set of players as we choked the life out of it by refusing low offers for actions.

One play is not enough to judge this in a balanced way. Clearly there is a clever mechanism here but at this stage I'm surprised the game is ranked so highly.

Aha, they changed "The Traders of Genoa" to just "Genoa" now. Well, I have the old "Traders" edition of the game. I like the game quite a bit, but it fell flat with my game group (I tried it twice with them). I think most members of my game group are a little too much of the quiet type to negotiate well. Games in great condition, BTW, make me an offer!!!

Magnificent game. With nearly no downtime, loads of critical decisions, in both tactical and strateigic planning, full-scale negotiation trough which nearly any game resouce can be traded and an intriguing action allowance system; The Traders of Genoa is likely to keep hitting the table for the forseeable future.

This game is on my 'To Review List'. Watch this space.

My preferred trading/negotiating game (over Settlers).  Definitely requires a lively crowd that's ready to wheel and deal.  If someone is not ready to be active and verbal, it will bring down the whole game.  Given the right group, though, this one takes the luck out of Settlers and amps up the interaction and competition to 11.  There are some set strategies, but all players will still have to be very flexible, adapting to the orders they have and the whims of the controlling player.

Original game in which you can trade just about anything. Unfortunately this means experienced and new players don't mix well as new players don't know what to offer/ask for anything. This makes the game less interesting for my as I'm often in a group of mixed experience. So this one, while original and well designed, just does not fit in my collection.

This could be great with the right group or terrible with the wrong group. This is a negotiation game, with money being the method of showing victory. You (mostly) need to work out deals for the other players to move where you want them to go. Then you can get goods, fill orders, etc. and make money. More negotiation than anything else. I would like to explore this game further as my one and only play did not go very well. Still, it held my attention and I saw it's potential. 

Highly interactive and tense. It looks like it's best played with the full compliment of players.

Negotiation's not my thing. I love other Rudiger Dorn games, though, so I gave it a try. I played with a great group, so it had its fun moments and there was a lot of laughing, but I probably wouldn't play it again. Also, our 5-player game took 2.5 hours! If the game had been an hour long, I'd probably consider playing it again, but because the length of the game is randomly decided by the dice rolls, the chance that it could be that long again would prevent me from playing it. That said, aside from the negotiation element, I liked the rest of the game. If the negotiation mechanic were replaced by something else for determining the path through the city and who gets what actions, I'd like it.

I enjoyed this one.  It moved along fairly quickly once you get a feel for it.  I do like the free form trading, but I could see it bogging down badly if people are really tight about it.  

Update:  Raised to an 8.  It had been 3 years since I last played so I had to relearn again.  I found there is a ton of ways to get money in the game and room for tricky play.  I'm looking to play this again much sooner than later.  i.e., not waiting three years again and probably not waiting 3 months for that matter.  Three weeks maybe?  :)

RATING: 7
Fun game.  We have never encountered problems with protracted trading.  Need the right type of people.

Edit: Perhaps too heavy and long for a negotiation game.  It is almost fatiguing to play this game.  Near the end the intensity of negotiations drops considerably and stuff becomes more tractable to calculations which undermines the negotiation.  Still, the first hour is incredibly fun.  Someone should take a stab at a shorter version.

If you don't hate trading games, you must give this a try.

It can be a little bit long (considering you do the same things over and over) but it's quite the game. Very balanced and interesting mechanics. About as heavy as a trading game could possibly be (any heavier would be bad because of the inherent balance issues a trading game can have).

I do find it annoying that the base number for the game is 5 (why not 1, 2, 8, 20 bills? much easier...) and the paper money that comes with the Alea edition is really really crappy. The one from the new Filosofia edition is much nicer, even if the box is mightily oversized)

RATING: 6
Not bad for a negotiation game.  I need to stop accepting offers for moves/actions after I reach my desired spot; it's just not worth selling actions to your opponents for 5 or 10 bucks each when ending your turn early (thus denying them the actions) will slow opponents considerably.  I'm a sucker for the privilege cards... they are one of the most random parts of the game, but I'm realizing that negotiations should center around them since there are tons of points to be had with sets of privilege cards.  The trick with them will be determining a fair value for trades.  There's also a lot to be said for the shop ownership tokens (from the Cathedral); they are very powerful when used on the central buildings... and when combined with the "building action" card from the Palace.  Almost everything is negotiable, which makes the game pretty free-form... naturally it turns into a "hurt the leader" game... the downside of free-form is having to play favorites when you get equal offers.

This proved itself to be the great game I expected; every element is there, carefully considered, to enhance the game play experience.  I wouldn't change a thing for fear of upsetting the well tuned mechanism.  Three hours for a 5-player ride passed us all by and left me wanting more.  Highly recommended, except for those who either: A) can't stand negotiation games, or B) haggle over the price of individual Cheerios 'O's in a cereal box.  Last played on 29 Sept.

This game only works with the right player group. People who like to plan for themselves and are accustomed to deterministic strategies will probably find this an enormously boring game. The fact that everything is tradeable and negotiable is both a strength and a weakness. It's a pity the other mechanics are so bland.

In the three or four plays I had, I never had much fun. I'm a real euro game fan, but this one drags on and on for much too long.

First Impression: it took a long time to just go through the rules, but if I get to play it a few more times the investment will have been worth it. It is constant negotiation and pick up/deliver, with some kingmaker and screw your neighbor thrown in. Many ways to win and the ways dont seem unbalanced.   Update: This really is a very good game and I'll play it any time. I can see how the 'conflict' in the game could irritate some people.

I enjoy Chinatown - a game that Genoa is often compared to - quite a bit, so it's not as if I just have have a standing dislike for negotiation games. I think that difference is that the "goods" in Chinatown are much more limited so it's much easier to calculate the value of trades. In Genoa, one can trade goods, cards, buildings, and special tiles, and money, leading to the potential that trades will be a mishmash of this, that, and the other thing with no clear idea of where the value lies. One might as well toss the bits i nthe air and grab a pile at random.

RATING: 5.5
Not our kind of game, though a cool concept: a resource-management, strategy Euro whose central mechanic is negotiation. Sadly, I don't think the blend works very well here. 

Negotiation games are predicated on imbalances and group dynamics (i.e. people conspire to stop a strong leader), but in Genoa, players tend to simply go for what is best for them without working hard enough to stop the player in the lead. This is because there is so much hidden information in this game (Orders, Messages, Privileges), that it's often difficult to tell who is leading until it's too late. Additionally, the fact that the game can end very suddenly based on a couple of die rolls also means that long-term planning (and general knowledge of the game state) is impossible. So, it's an interesting idea, but ultimately a flawed one.

I like the dealmaking, but it takes a long time to play the game (at least 3 hours).  Probably gets quicker as people understand the game more, but I'm not sure I will play it enough times to get to that point.

I've played this again recently, and age has caught up to Traders of Genoa a bit. It's long for today's gaming environment, and a bit repetitive, especially with 5. There are so few good deal-making games though that I still rate it very highly, but the field isn't that competitive. Today I'd generally take Quo Vadis or Chinatown ahead of this. Fun to see the first iteration of the ideas that would become Istanbul.

This one game might pay for all your games that you ever get!  How??? 

Because this game teaches you, many things are negotiable.  Playing Traders of Genoa can lead you to negotiate your salary, price of a house and other big and small things.  

The other game that can potential make you money is [gameid=6552].

Based on 1 play: A very interesting negotiation game. There's a lot of strategy to this. It might last a little long for some (though actually our game only lasted about an hour and the fact that a turn goes by just from landing in the market helps this), it constantly keeps you engaged. Since there's no downtime at all the game moves at a really nice pace. I love the way that absolutely everything is negotiable/up for trade. Unfortunately we played a little wrong during our first game (only noticed until toward the end), so I look forward to playing correctly from the start soon! I definitely see this rating rising with more plays.

The mechanics in this game are great.  The negotiations work, if the players know the value of what they are negotiating for.  However, this game is just too long for the payoff, and I think it has a few problems.  It is one of those games you think is fantastic, or you just go ehhh.

Its a good game, but there's not enough there to merit the length. Very repetitive. "uh I'll offer 5 to go there" - "wait I'll offer 10" "15" etc etc etc etc etc etc Cut the playing time in half, and it's a 7. Update: I have played this more now with 3, 4, and 5 and I must say I much prefer it with the lower numbers. Much quicker, and doesn't seem to lose all that much. With 3, plays more like a tactical resource management game than a negotiation game, and that is OK with me.

I owned this game for a year without being able to get it to the table. The reason for this is probably that I mostly play with 1, 2 or 3 other guys, and this game seems to need 5 players in order to shine. And those few times when we finally are 5 players, there are just so many other games we want to play. I think I would like the game, but not love it. Would like to try it and I'm sure I'm going to one day.

Original abstract trading game. Can outstay its welcome if the negotiations aren't brisk. Fulfilling orders and running messages (don't even bother to plan those - they'll all occur at some point) are the ways to make money. Collecting a set of adjacent buildings offers a feeble return for the effort.

Simply superb game. Played it with our gaming group and all agreed it is a favourite. In fact has temporarily replaced Siedler as the group's choice for the after dinner game. Interaction pure.

RATING: 6
Well, I can certainly say that I'm a fan of negotiation games. Rated this an 8 after one play with five people. I can pretty much guarantee that not everyone shares my same view; with negotiation, some people love it, and some don't.

Any negotiation game needs something that drives the bargaining. In Genoa, it's "the tower." You need something? You need me to move that tower to your spot. It's a great mechanism for driving people to hagggle.

A few drawbacks. Our game clocked in at three hours. Yeesh. For me, the time flew by. But that's a big commitment. I gotta think that the game will flow smoother with familiarity, but any negotiation can potentially drag depending on the personalities at the table. 

If you're a fan of negotiation games, you should give this a shot. There's not many "big box" games like it.

Update: 2nd play, and I still like it, and it still takes too long. Another five player game, this time with great fellow gamers that are not slow players, and it still took about three hours. Next time, I'd be very tempted to simply shave off a round at the start. I can't think of any significant drawbacks, and I don't think the "game arc" or narrative would suffer for it, even if we rolled the market and lost a turn on top of that. It's a very intriguing negotiation game, but one that's too taxing at its current length.

Update: after a third play, I decided to trade this one away. Again, I was struck by the slow pacing of this game. I love the "tower" as a mechanic for putting the current player in the driver's seat for negotiations, but this game strikes me as lasting a bit too long, with a bit too much clutter with all the various commodities, contracts, etc. Although this is supposed to be the negotiation game for gamers, I find myself rather wanting to get Chinatown to the table instead. There's a lot to like with this game, but the few things that irk me means I don't need to own it.

RATING: 7
I'm not the biggest fan of pure negotiation games, and I'd rather not play them too often--when I'm not really in the hardball negotiation mindset, I tend to almost give away trades to anyone who asks--but I enjoy this one quite a bit.  There's money exchanged every step of the way, and one must definitely make the most of vested interests.  Several different moneymaking strategies are viable, so it's possible to see a close game between players who're using completely different strategies--fun and refreshing.

We play this 2-player.  Negotiation games can fall flat with 2, but this one offers a nice incentive for trading.  If you accept a trade offer from your opponent then you get to take a bonus action.  There's a lengthy rulebook to plow through before you can get started.  Our first game, including reading the rules, took nearly 3 hours.  Our second game (with a review of the rules) shaved an hour off that.  Now it only takes about an hour.  Once you understand the rules, they really aren't all that complicated.  This game mixes negotiations with pick-up and deliver and set collecting.  There are lots of ways to attack it.  You can choose what to focus your efforts on based on what you prefer and how the game plays out.  With 2 players, taking Privilege cards is very important.  This is quite an engaging game; everyone can be involved, regardless of whose turn it is.

RATING: 9
Update: It just jumped to a 9 on the second play. Now, if we can get it in in 2 1/2 hours, it would be a solid 10. Best commercial negotiation game that I know of by a long shot. (Diplomacy is still the #1 strategic negotiation game in my book, even though I rate it lower. Just too long.)

Months after playing this for the first time, I can't stop thinking about it. I love how the different ways of scoring creates a spread between player valuations for the same items. It is this spread that makes the negotiations fresh. I don't like to rate things higher than an 8 before a second play, but if I did, this would likely be a 9.

Genoa is a trade and negotiations game. You can trade almost everything and there is very little luck involved, so victory depends only on your negotiations skills. Game would be better if there were coins with 1 dublon.

RATING: 9
Everything can be and is frequently traded.  Shanghai-style free-form bazaar. No downtime.  Maintain a larger average vig.  Actual values of items are mostly soft and mostly relative.  Exploit trade deltas.

While the rules declare that the tower route should be sold iteratively from the start space, the game is considerably improved if the entire route is sold and agreed in advance of actually putting the tower down and doing anything.  This can extend as far as also selling the location chosen for the StartAnywhere card.  Thus a turn could easily start with a statement like: "I'm using a StartAnywhere and at some point I'm going to the Harbour -- who wants to go where?" and then leaving everything about the entire turn, including whether or not you even go to the harbour open to sale and negotiation.

Ohh, and trade goods and cards more readily than money.  Really.  They're both represent only potential value and have a higher gradient value than cash.  Exploit that fact.

Also improved by playing with open money via poker chips.

:tobacco: :( :what: :what: :D :D UPDATE: After a second run-through (one that actually finished up in a reasonable time no less) I feel more confidence recommending this game, but really only for those who share my predilection for negotiation/haggling games. I feel we left a lot of the game's strategic space unexplored (almost all our trading was cash-for-actions, which led to the game featuring a lot of moves that ended up with a net profit of zero at best) but I think there's a lot of game here. If I had to guess (and I'm DEFINITELY no expert), the key to the game is creative uses for the special tiles, creating positive-sum swaps (win-wins where you win more, ideally) and setting yourself up as the merchant to get people to pay you to take actions you'd do anyway.

---


I've been on a bit of an anti-Euro kick of late. More accurately I've been on an anti-Euro-as-the-term-is-defined-now-in-2015 kick; I'll bounce back but at the moment I'm just burned out on blocking-as-interaction/action-efficiency/multiplayer solitaire/worker-placement/trade-a-pink-cube-for-a-white-cube/the whole megillah.

So forgive me for being a bit leery when a friend brought Traders of Genoa (we played the Alea edition, what of it) to game night. I mean, German designer? Yep. Renaissance Apple Merchant theme, roughly applied with borrowed Glu-Stik? Ooh yes. Blandly named for one port city or another? Hooah. Picture of a dour ofay wearing a silly hat on the box cover? Just so. My eyes glaze over at the thought.

And yet -- very much not that in the end. I mean, yes, sure pasted on theme, but the theme (along with everything else about the game) is just a minimal framework which gives an ultimate purpose and direction to the real game: [b]negotiating, bargaining and bidding over every goddamned thing under the sun[/b]. Everything you collect in the game -- money, goods, special powers -- is just an asset. Some assets you care about more than others. Some assets others care about more than you.

Except money. Everybody needs money. That's why they call it "money."

And everything that happens in the game -- where you go and whether you can actually do anything when you get there, to pick two examples -- is subject to debate, bickering, and, ultimately, somebody standing up and saying Eff You Pay Me Or Nobody Gets Nothing.

And -- oh yes -- the game is ruthlessly designed to give players leverage and change the equation of that leverage with every small movement.

So, leverage and arbitrage. Arbitrage and leverage. A giant swap meet where pretty much everything goes.

Is this everyone's idea of fun? I am already compiling a list of people I am morally certain will hate the whole experience. But I, after playing a game that was aborted somewhere near the end of the first trimester, am intrigued. My hesitation is that the experience might get a little long for what it is. (The box claims a playtime of 60 minutes is possible; to call this a polite understatement is itself a bit of a polite understatement.) I would budget 3 hours and if you're getting it done more quickly, you're probably leaving money on the table as a group. And play this with people who like to flap their gums and strike deals, or you're in for a pretty grim time; this isn't a game like Tammany Hall that's fun whether your group likes to negotiate or not.

If you love free-form negotiation games, this one is for you.  We play that anything and everything can be traded.  WE even allow the promise of a future action, though we allow those deals to be "forgotten" to create an environment of spite and retribution that really forces somebody to weigh the cost benefit ratio of their action.  The game is about making the right deal to increase the progress towards your objective (at the time) while making deals sweet enough to entice others to give you that bigger slice of the pie.  Trouble is, you don't always know if you are helping your trading partner more than yourself.

In the end, I hoped this would be my go-to negotiation game, but I never had the right group for it.  Lifeboats and Bohnanza filled the niche and was more their speed.  Traded

I like this game, it's balanced, has lots of options, and looks great. I recall being somewhat kerfuddled about how much I liked this game when I first sat down to it, but it eventually grew on me. Exceptional in that there are an abundant number of different ways to approach it successfully. Small Orders are easier to cash in than large orders, but offer no special chits. Cathedral tokens to "own" buildings offer some needed flexibility and income, but they also tend to make you a target. The Post Office message cards don't pay off a lot, but they are very easy to meet. And so on. Another interesting thing that I like about this game is that it is rather accessible for a heavy weight game. I have used this as an introductory game with much success, and I believe a goodly part of the reason why it works is that even though there are a lot of ways to win, the end goal, making money, is always intelligible. In addition to that, the game is very, very social, and it keeps players involved constantly because of the mechanism whereby you are negotiating for the right to take actions on other players turns. When you add this to the hidden victory points, you get a complicated game with plenty of room for nuanced play which nonetheless keeps new gamers involved and never makes them feel as though they're out of the race. However, the game depends heavily on the group to sink or swim. With people who are moderately social the game is only decent, while with a raucous group of 4 or 5 who love to haggle it's unbelievably good. If you have more of the latter than the former this game is a must buy, for others it's recommended to try it first. One major complaint: Not nearly enough money is included in the box, five player games often end with a cleaned out bank, is it too much to ask for two pads of cash instead of the meager one?

Great trading game that hinges almost entirely on brokering deals to take advantageous actions and balancing opportunity costs with profit.  It's much more engaging and strategically open-ended than most German games, which is good, but it is something of a one-note affair.  This isn't a problem if players don't dawdle and reach agreements quickly but it could easily get bogged down in negotiations.  Very satisfying but not for the socially malfeasant.

Fairly typical light euro. Main mechanic is that the active player sells the opportunity to do (up to five) actions which are geographically constrained. The path to victory is (largely) collecting sets of goods and trading them in for points, though as long as a player does some of this other point gaining activities can be fruitfully used. The randomness is small (in a broad sense), but as annoying as the randomness in Puerto Rico.

I bought this game when I was still in the habit of buying games unplayed to expand my collection, trusting well-known sites (not this one, hadn't discovered it yet) to provide me with objective information. And with this game on everyone's 'must have' list, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Welllll... after a game or two, I was't too sure. For one thing, the game's sole focus on trade bored me. Everything is for sale, and the trick is to value stuff better than your competitors do. I'm sure there's an art to it, but it's not one I found very interesting. Second, once the rush of learning the title ebbed away (which is fun to do because there are tons of little things to try) I found the actual game of trading, trading and trading some more annoying, especially in the groups I played it with. My fellow players are quick bargainers, but they are also always on the lookout to squeeze blood from a stone. Traders is a game of give and take, not a game of take and take, and this sapped the fun out of the proceedings quicker than a sand desert soaks up water. It helped that people can force things along by not moving the disc tower, but if this happens too often the mood quickly turns sour. Finally, no matter what group I played with, the last few turns were very boring as noone was going to spend money on assignments they knew they were not likely to complete anyway. Everyone just wants the game to end; personally I think the game lasts for 2 or even 3 rounds too many. The game is a 6 for the first 2/3rds of the game; and a meagre 4 for the last 1/3rd—average is about 5. I wanted to like this when it was still early in my discovery of modern boardgames, but it turned out the be one of the earliest failures. A shame, but shit happens. The game never got played after the initial attempts, and was let go late 2009.

[b]Update[/b] A few replays over the years with someone else's copy cemented the cold harsh reality that negotiation games are not meant for me nor the groups I play with. I dislike their artificialness and cannot make myself become someone who will haggle for stuff.

Did the world really need another game decided by who gets hooked up most by the other players?  Apparently someone thought so, because that is the sole mechanic behind Genoa.  An obvious avoid if I wanted a game that, at best, is a popularity contest, I'd go back to high school.

A great game for the right group.  Is a bit long, but that doesn't matter when everyone is trying to win.  Really have to pay attention that you don't try and influence future deals.  Giving hints where you want the tower to go is really not on.  Paying to move the tower toward where you want it is acceptable.

Very enjoyable trading game. I'm not always in the mood for that much negotiation, but when I am, this game is great. Pulling off (or seeing others pull off) particularly intricate combinations can be gratifyingly entertaining, and I love that everything is tradable. [i](Including the game itself, after a humorous inquiry to that effect - though only because I had trouble getting it to the table with my usual playgroup.)[/i]

Not a game to play with Very Serious People Who Get Angry When They Feel Thwarted. Whenever there's bargaining, there'll be occasional hard sells, bidding wars, unreasonable demands, or times when you don't get what you want.

Production: Lots of well-made bits, and an easy-to-understand board.  The art design on the cards was uncreative, and I would have appreciated some symbology on the special action tiles to acclimate me to their powers.  Play: There’s a lot going on in this game, as each player is usually working toward a unique objective at any given time, but their needs cross paths, making for interesting bargaining.  I think the game could be simplified a bit (4 commodities instead of 8, for instance) without losing its potential for interaction and conflict; I suppose I just felt a bit lost on my first playing because there were so many options from which to choose.  (2+1+3) (1 play)

One of the best overall trading game, high interaction between players and almost no downtime between players at all here. After more than 10 games with the same group, it is not a title I am willing to play so often. But some of my friends still love it, so I guess it's my opinion. Edit: After another couple of plays, it's really of a long and boring exercise of trading without any possible long-term strategy, you can maximize results for what you got in your hand of cards and eventually try to disturb the other players. But nothing more. My rating is decreased accordingly...

RATING: 6.5
Pretty good game if you play with 3 players or 4 players who like to move on. Too much negotiation or playing with 5 makes this game drag, which is not so good for a game with the same mechanic every turn. Lots of ways to victory and it's a lot of fun to try to be more clever than your opponents in the deals.

Seems to have fallen a bit flat the last few plays, so I have downgraded to a 6. Have to keep the pace going and not overanalyze I think. Can drag badly otherwise.

RATING: 8
There are different strategies to pursue (thus different ways of valuing items/actions) and each 'delivery' card forces different valuation of goods.

This variance in player evaluation seems essential for a good trading/negotiation game.

Players take the part of Renaissance traders, moving about the city acquiring goods and filling orders for goods. Messages need to be delivered and privileges obtained. Much negotiation and deal-making is the order of the day in an effort to become the richest deal-maker in Genoa. Flexible rules allow for negotiating almost everything in the game.

No sir, I don't like it.  The game's too long for what it is (I've seen 3+ hour games), the negotiations aren't very interesting ("Anyone want this action?  anyone..?"  this is where the length comes in...), and while I like the diminishing stack of actions mechanism in theory, the randomness of it really bothers me.

Too much negotiation and I found myself not caring much.  Way too much downtime between turns, as you only get one action each turn (except the rare instance where you have an Extra Action tile).

Hands-down the best trading game I've played.  So many trade possibilities: money, cubes (8 different types), special tiles (4 types), cards (4 types), ownership markers.  For a game with this many trading options, I can't believe how clean it is. I can't wait to play again and explore different strategies!  If you like Settlers of Catan but find yourself wanting to do more in terms of trades, you should pick this one up.  My only problem with it is the trading can really drag as players hold out for better deals.  Maybe a sandtimer is needed in order to speed it up.

This was another game that I had been looking at for awhile, with quite a bit of interest. It has been out of print since I started playing board games, and the only who I know who owns it is Mr. Knauer. He left it over at my place to read the rules, but it took me a long time to get around to it. So long, that we didn't end up first playing it until the very end of September 2008. 

The game itself ended up being incredibly fun. The constant negotiation, money changing hands, and weighing of the pros and cons resulted in a feisty interesting negotiation game that I found to both be a challenge and a truly enjoyable time. I am planning on picking up the "Genoa" reprint when it is published in 2009, and currently rate the game an 8.1.

A wonderfully interactive game. The basic mechanic is to trade and barter with your other players to accomplish certain tasks and deliver certain goods.

A true gamer&#039;s game of trade and negotiation, set in the city of Genoa. Players move a trading tower around the city and sell off the actions of buildings visited.

[Dorn] A very very good game in the negotiate/bribe/trade vein which adds several improvements over the classic Ponte Vecchio. I like the contraints that Traders of Genoa adds: it gives you good trading options and structure. The hidden orders avoid the chaotic-freewheeling-turned-math-equation of Chinatown. But why does the rulebook use the term 'movement tower' when it is plainly the horse dookey trail that marks your route!

Clever ideas do not necessarily make a good game; this is a prime example. Valuations are convoluted, and barely estimable.

Too bad it wasn't any fun.

I'm not a big Eurogame fan to begin with, but this one is the worst I've played. Dreadful and tedious. Think Arkham Horror length with insomnia-crushing mechanics. Why do I still own it? Who knows. Probably no one wants it, and I dread throwing out a board game, even if it's a bored game.

RATING: 6
Hard to rate this one. Hard to rate negotiation games in general, as it is more about the players than the game, and the game just provides a context for the players to trade around. 

The game is long, and (unlike Mall of Horror) I can't say that all the mechanisms add new dimensions to the trading. But it doesn't detract from it either, and doesn't "get in the way" or feel like chrome for the sake of chrome. Whatever complexity there is, while not devilishly clever, doesn't feel unnecessary either and works. For that, I'll give it an 8. But honestly, I wouldn't want to play this, or any negotiation game, very often.

UPDATE: The game can still drag a little bit, but even when long, the game is still enjoyable as you're doing something on everyone's turn. There is very little down-time in this game. Bumping up to a "9".

A very fun game that can get a little chaotic at times. Everytime I've played I was convinced someone was going to win and I've been wrong everytime (even when I was the winner). The theme and the mechanics are attractive. Biggest complaint is turns can drag if people are undecisive about their offers (myself included).

Loved my first game of Traders of Genoa. Bought a copy after playing Traders of Genoa.

I played twice so far with my copy of Traders of Genoa. I feel the same way as my first game. I enjoy Traders of Genoa quite a lot, though possibly it's not a game for everyone since there is a lot of negotiations during the game. Some can be turned off by that. Everyone has their taste in board games. The players you play with at Traders of Genoa adds to the enjoyability of the game. Either hit or miss.

The gamers I played with had a good time playing this game. Lots of negotiations and jokes took place when dealing with the tower player. Influencing the tower player with the different offers and trying to convince him/her that your offer is the best is quite something to see at times. Good times!

Game plays a bit differently between a 4 player game and a 5 player game. One more player is more intense when dealing with the tower player. Not everyone can make actions every turn with 5 players. It makes negotiations more important if you want to make a profit and trying to win the game.

The more you deal in Traders of Genoa the better. I would want to play the game again to test some strategies in the game.

I would need to try the game with different people to see how negotiation changes from person to person.

Traded Traders of Genoa in a game trade. Something I might get back in my collection.

The primary mechanic in this game is auction and/or negotiation and I usually don't like auction games; hence, the low rating.  Rating represents a consensus rating derived from my rating, my wife's rating, and my sister's rating.  On the plus side, the game is visually appealing with nice bits, except for the incongruously bad money.  Our game group was left with a vague feeling of dissatisfaction at the end of the game.  After one play, went on to the trade list.

Excellent negotiation game.  The main issue is the length of the game but long games don't bother me if there's a lot of depth and interaction.  

***Recently played a 4 player game (one round was subtracted from rolling in the middle of the board) that took two hours, the perfect length.

Engaging and exciting game play. The game design by Rudiger Dorn is incredibly clever and really challenges the players to bring out their best gaming skills. Only one thing I can say to Mr. Dorn. "We're not worthy! We're not worthy!" The only downside: it doesn't work with more introverted gaming groups.

RATING: 7
Hmm, I thought I would like it more.  Trading is such a pure mechanic, and one that promises replayability and unpredictability.  I think part of my problem with the mechanic is that I want to play trading games more slowly - whereas I'm willing to make a computational error in an analytic game, I'm much more afraid of making a bad trade in a game like this.

I think this is a case where the theme could have been given more thought.  Wandering around an Italian city is not really an ideal setting for a cruel, wild game of anything goes - and the same old trade goods adds a fustiness to the proceedings.  Definitely seems like a game that I would enjoy more with more plays, a certain comfortability with the mechanics would probably allow for more complex negotiations.  I don't care much for the privilege option - we had one player go for broke on it and it sort of removed him from what everyone else was trying to do and had him rely on luck.  Normally multiple strategies are a good attribute, but I think in a game with open trading, it helps to have all the players trying to get roughly the same things to maximize bidding intrigue.

Renaissance trading game, the negotiation/trading aspect sounds fantastic, but maybe too long and complex.  Make people commit to playing two games to try it: the first will be rough, but they'll be hooked after the second.  Most agree that it's too long for what it is, and needs just the right people to work.

This one is not my cup of team, but if you like negotiation games, then Genoa is a must for you to try. I was taken with the clever decisions that the game gives you and the number of options on your turn. Each turn you get to move the “cart”, which basically means you get to choose the spaces that will be in play this turn. A space may be simply a street space (which has its own implications) or a building which offers actions (the heart of the game). So you might choose to move to the buildings for actions, but here’s the catch – you can only take one of the actions. You auction off the remaining actions to your opponents. They can offer to share the benefit of the building or offer you something else entirely. 

Everything is liquid in this game and the combination of moves and trades you can make is staggering (oh, do you have options). It’s the strength and weakness of the game, IMO, because you want to explore all these options -- as each of these options involves negotiation -- but after a couple hours of min/maxing options and weighing offers, it gets tiresome and weary for me. You don’t want to rush players as the raison d'etre of the game is to consider the 101 things you can do each turn. 

So I liked the profundity it offered but at the same time, I wanted less. The two hour mark seems perfect for such a deep game so we could all really take time during our turns without the game getting to the point where it dragged, but this is a 3-4 hour beast.

I like the feeling of running around town, trying to accomplish the right tasks to make the most money, that Traders has.  This is one of those games where options exceed opportunities (which can be intriguing or frustrating, depending on your mood), but it certainly offers the hope that you will be able to try something new the next time you play.  Unfortunately, unless every player has experience, it may not feel like a "true game," as haggling is much more effective when everyone can estimate the value of trades!

Played 2 times. I like it better than Chinatown, but it is a bit long. Time will tell if the game gets stale, but initialy I think this is a good deal making game. I will say that I didn't at all care for the 2-player version -- the nil-sum is a real problem since the rules force at least one good to be a part of the offer. Stick with 3-5 players.

Not a 2-player game.  This game of negotiation has strict rules.  Turns are limited so your strongest chance for winning, is negotiation for actions.  However, there are many action paths to follow to gain the most ducats to win. I haven't played another game like it, so it is refreshing to play.

RATING: 4
Unusual trading/negotiation and routing game. I liked how you sell off your extra actions and how you are fulfilling missions. I'm souring on this game because it seems to take forever...

Duration: There's little book-keeping and little downtime as you can bid on everyone else's turn, furthermore there is a turn limit. However wrangling can go on, so it's best to keep things moving.
Design: Unusual movement mechanic and action-selling mechanic.
Strategy: The privileges are pretty random, but the open negotiation lets you do a lot. You can collude and gang up to some extent, and there is the potential for metagaming.
Components: Workmanlike, not artistic in any way.
Theme: The mechanics fit the theme, especially messaging and sending rice to the restaurant. The theme is still another Renaissance European economic situation though.

Love the chaos feel and the challenge of making a plan out of a wide open structure.  I'm itching to play this one again!  Don't play it with people who annoy you.  Don't become annoyed when other people get in the way of your plans.  Almost everything you want to do in this game has to come about through the other players and their actions.  How can you influence them?  How creative are you?  For me it's a draining game to play and it's constant thinking and evaluating.  It wears me out like Modern Art, which is good thing.  Lot's of talking in this game, you don't sit quietly and build an economy like you do in many Euros.  This is a game about interacting with the other folks at the table and trying to get that tower to go your way.  Love the look and feel of the production.

[Negotiation, Trading] {5P:7, 4P:4} So far the best game featuring a negotiation mechanic that I've played. It's structured enough to keep the inmates in the madhouse, but it's free enough that creative deals can be struck. It CAN run really long (we took 2.5 hours for a 4P game), but just keep the pace up and you won't feel the time fly by. Recommended.

Negotiation games aren't my cup of tea, and Genoa is about as negotiable as a game can possibly be. Everything is up for trade: Money, goods, contracts, privileges, actions, and even the steps to take on the board. Nothing is safe, nothing is sacred.

Since the game consists of nothing but bartering the key to victory is having a more precise appreciation of value than your opponents. That's all there is to it, and it can get a little repetitive after a while.

That said, unless you hate negotiation Genoa certainly deserves a try. It's clearly at the top of its class, and rightfully so.

Something about this game shouldn't work, but it does! The negotiation aspect is just so open that it would be easy for the game to easily fall into a free-for-all shout fest of deals.  And sometimes that happens, but for me, it's an aspect of the game I enjoy. There is some luck in the game considering the multiple card draws, but overall there is a lot to think about and this game is perfect for those who enjoy negotiation, manipulation, trade, psych-outs, and all that good stuff that comes in a game like this. Not my favourite Dorn game (Goa is just so good!) but this one is a great one with the right crowd. I can definitely see people not enjoying it, however - even those who might like some other negotiation games. This game can leave you feeling raw!  Genoa is historically significant because it introduced Rudiger Dorn to the larger gaming world and also was the first instance of his 'tower' mechanic (seen later in games like Goa and Istanbul). That part is enjoyable, and so is the negotiation aspect. But I think the length of the game vs. what players get out of it is a bit unforgivable these days. The game, unfortunately, has no development. You play it for 2 hours and the first round feels exactly like the last round. Because nothing grows or develops on the board, you are simply taking each turn to complete the cards you currently have in your hand. Once complete, get new cards. Then repeat. This would feel good for a 1-hour game, but 2 hours is really stretching it. You're basically doing the same things over and over again. And the game can't be that much shorter because luck would play more of a part to it. The length is what balances the luck out for everyone and gives all players enough time to take enough efficient turns needed to make advances. I think this is an important game historically and I would play it again if others asked, but it's feeling a little dated now and Dorn quickly hit it out of the park in a much better way with Goa. I still can't think of a negotiation game that does negotiation as interestingly as Genoa does, so it will be hard to replace that aspect. But I would feel a little long in the tooth introducing this game to new players when there are much meatier and more interesting games to play if I had 2 hours to spare.

The purest of the negotiation games that I have played. This game is all player interaction, and can lend itself to some heated negotiations and debates on what are good deals.  Traders of Genoa can slow down and run long, but as opposed to some people I have no problem with this, as it usually means players are involved.  For me the biggest drawback is, in my experience, that inevitably someone feels left out - as if they were never considered in offers, and therefore never felt allowed to compete.  I am not sure if this is an absolute with the game, as it makes sense to me to try and diversify the deals so as not to let anyone player  to get too far ahead.  Aside from these, what I deem fixable irritants, I believe Traders to be an enjoyable game.  Highly interactive and tense. Best played with full compliment of players.

The best trading game I have ever played.  Wow.  Loads of fun.  Enough going on alongside the trading to make it really interesting.  It's got movement, a constant stream of interesting decisions, and full-time engagement by all the players.

I'm going to quote Josh Miller to explain why it's so good:  "What elevates Traders of Genoa over many other pure negotiation games is that there's actually a lot of "game" surrounding the central activity of negotiation. Games like Chinatown, I'm The Boss, Intrige and Rette Sich Wer Kann (Lifeboats) are less interesting because the bare-bones structure makes the purse very easy to calculate. Traders of Genoa does a better job of clouding the water by using a more complex game system, more hidden information, and varying paths and goals among the players. Consequently, there's more to the game than persuading, coaxing, bullying, deflecting, begging, and threatening. There are also interesting game decisions to be made.'

The best negotiation game I had played and probably the best one in the market. If I were a negotiation fan I would rate it with a 10 probably, but I am not. Game is easy to explain but difficult to play correctly. You will need many plays to do it well. Its an interactive fest, in which you can offer/trade everything, from money to goods and rewards. A superior game than Chinatown, but also more difficult to grasp and to play. Rules are pretty straightforward and clear, but in my opinion they need some corrections like the bonus for the fast turns as some people are just bad at negotiating and it takes them forever. In this case, it may not be a bad idea to set a timer or the game could drag with a/p players. As other games like Republic of Rome, Greed Inc or Princes of Renaissance, it needs a good talking and interactive group or could be a little bit boring. Played with the correct group a pretty entertaining experience, and if you love negotiation games, just the best pick you can make.

A pretty cool negotiation gamer where everything is up for grabs. There's nothing you can't trade in this game. And conversely there's little else to do. Fun for a while but after a few plays I find the market settles on a price for goods and actions that dampens the interest somewhat. If there were some other decisions to be made it might become more interesting. Having said that, if you're looking for a pure negotiation game this is worth a look.

Picked this up at Hairy Trantula in Toronto when up there for my Aniversary.  Tried it out last weekend, what a different interesting game.  This game uses a very interesting mechanic that reminds me just a bit of Puerto Rico.  It's like Puerto rico on each players turn every player may take one action.  Other then that though this game is very unique.  Players need to deliver goods and messages around the city of Genoa, the interesting part is that the Trader starts in a random place each turn and can only move 4 additional spaces, it's up to the player who's turn it is to decide where he should go and the other players Bribe the acting player trying to convince them to move the Trader to places that would be advantageous to them.  It's a very different style, and seems very open for a variety of different play styles.

I've never played a game quite like this one. I really enjoy the freedom of it, with there being no real phases in the classic sense. So far each game has been deadly close. Once I was perceived as holding the lead only to make a few mistakes and drop to third place.

If you like games that test your diplomatic and economic skill this one is for you.

The moving tower is probably the coolest and most unique game mechanic I've seen. The negotiation is really cool. Unfortunately, there are dominant strategies that do not require a lot of player interaction, and after a few games the amount of negotiation that takes place drops off considerably. At least with my group. If we played a few more times this could change.

RATING: 9
Traders of Genoa was a pleasant surprise for me.  It's almost completely a game of negotiation, and I'm not always crazy about that sort of game.  Early reports made the game sound like an open-ended marathon of attrition that would turn all but the diehard deal-makers into a shivering pool of goo.

But I tried it anyway, and I'm glad I did.  Yes, everything in the game is tradeable, but that breadth of possibilities has never caused the negotiations to drag on too long in our group.  Most deals can be arranged simply and quicly if the players don't get bogged down in minutiae.  However, there's definitely a particular breed of perfectionist with whom I'd avoid playing this game.

What elevates Traders of Genoa over many other pure negotiation games is that there's actually a lot of "game" surrounding the central activity of negotiation.  Games like Chinatown, I'm The Boss, Intrige and Rette Sich Wer Kann (Lifeboats) are less interesting because the bare-bones structure makes the purse very easy to calculate.  Traders of Genoa does a better job of clouding the water by using a more complex game system, more hidden information, and varying paths and goals among the players.  Consequently, there's more to the game than persuading, coaxing, bullying, deflecting, begging, and threatening.  There are also interesting game decisions to be made.

Traders of Genoa demands a combination of calculation, forethought, creativity, wit, guile, and a silver tongue.  That makes for a broad and involving game experience.  One of the main attractions of a good negotiation game is the way it allows players' personalities to shine through.  Traders of Genoa is especially good here because it leaves room for a wide array of personalities.

Great, getting better for each time. Played without problem in less than two hours, BUT keep in mind that it's a trading game and not a negociating game. That is, when in turn expect 1 for your own action and half of the other actions and don't complicate the tradings to much more!

The one time I played this there were turns where it took over 5 minutes for the person in charge of the tower to decide where he/she would move around the board. OVER 5 MINUTES with NOTHING happening. How is this fun?

My girlfriend and I were both checked out an hour into the 2 and 1/2 hour game.

As for its weight and deepness I should really like this game. But there are things that tear down my rating: Negotiation. This kind of game mechanic is prone to show up negative traits of players ("no matter how much you bid I don't go where you like because it's you"). Additionally when played with more players there are not enough actions per turn for all of them available. I don't like game concepts where players often have to sit and wait until maybe next turn there are enough actions (unless they're the start player).

YEAH!
That's a game that we've been looking for! We love worker placement mechanism, but after buying such a classic like Agricola, Caylus (and Stone Age as a gateway) we had to find something different; not so complicated, not "so quite" (??...when everybody's thinking there's almost no talking), but not a simple family game. And we've found it! Lot of fun and opportunities to check your negotiation skills ;) no time for boring and (what is absolutely amazing about Genoa) ther's no downtime! You have to do something and stay focused all the time!
What's funny, it is said that play takes 90 minutes...maybe it's first play fault, but I don't think so :) first 2 plays took no less than 3 hours ;) and it's all our fault! we are tough negotiators ;)
Great! Recommended!
Only one thing: chose your opponents wisely. In that kind of games fun factor depends on them.

RATING: 8
This game is somewhat bewildering at first, since there's so much going on, so many ways to score, and so much trade and bargaining. The combination of many paths to victory and extensive interaction between players in open trade about virtually everything, makes this one of the greatest games.

Perhaps if the game had been designed today, it would have been made more simple. The complexity also contributes to a long playing time. The ownership markers, for instance, while intriguing and a good design feature as such, add more complexity to an already complex game than I think is justified from the perspective of keeping the game "neat and clear". It might have been better as an optional variant or expansion.

Four or five players.

Alterations/House rules: Poker chips in the open; Possibly Clearclaw's sell the entire route at once - Note: While one can only trade building spaces, the 'Start Anywhere' can be dragged along. Also, all deals are binding upon final agreement and the turn itself is executed atomically.

Touchstones: Everything is negotiable; Corners are valuable; One must quickly come up with a fixed price to aid bargaining; Absolute control of negotiations while it's one's turn.

This game responds to lots of bargaining, lots of propositions, lots of starting over.

„Alkudni, tárgyalni nem lehetőség, hanem kötelesség”
Hétvégén megismerhettem a fenti játékot egy 4 személyes tanuló parti keretében.
Nem a világom a kufárkodás, kereskedés, de nem tudtam ellenállni a 3 hölgy jelentette kihívásnak (természetesen utolsó lettem, így már szívesen tudom ajánlani, hogy milyen taktikát ne használj).
Hosszú szabályértelmezések után azért „belecsaptunk a lecsóba”. Játékosszámtól függő fordulók során mindenki irányít egy-egy kört. Alapvetően „küldetéseket” kell teljesítenünk, amiért pénz szerzünk meg, valamint épületek birtokosaivá válhatunk, amiért bérleti díjat szedünk. A küldetések során több pénzért és bónusz lapkáért több terméket kell egy adott helyszínre leszállítani, vagy kevesebbet kisebb összegért. Valamikor elegendő 2 adott helyszín között lehelyezni a lépésre használt torony jelzőit. Vagy nagyobb kockázatot vállalva „rágyúrhatunk” szerződésekre (ez tényleg lutri, de ha bejön, nagy kaszálás).
A körödben dobókockával határozod meg a torony kezdőhelyszínét, amelynek 5 korongjának lerakásával mozogsz a játéktáblán (városban). Itt lépnek be a többiek a körödbe. Különböző összegekért megpróbálhatják megvenni azt, hogy merre menj a torony korongjaival. Ha elfogadod (ha, tehát nem kötelező), akkor azt betartva helyezed le a korongokat utcára vagy egy-egy épületre. Minden körben minden játékos csak egy akciót hajthat végre. A te körödben ez ingyenes, amíg másoknak legalább 5 pénzt kell fizetni érte. A te körödben a te akciódat senki nem licitálhatja felül, de a többi helyszín vonatkozásában játékostársaid addig licitálhatnak, amíg az egyikük licitjét már senki nem kínálja felül. Na itt megy a „cicaharc”, pénzköltés. Közben nem kötelező mind az 5 korongot lehelyezned, amivel akadályozni tudod, hogy az „ellenkereskedők” minél több küldetéskártyájukat teljesíthessék.
Az akciók végrehajtása után a birtokjelzőkkel rendelkező egyének az éppen aktuális játékostól kezdve 1 vagy 2 épület tulajdonjogát megszerezhetik. Amikor valaki más épületén hajt végre akciót, annak tulajdonosa a közös készletből kap 10 érmét. Egy-egy fontosabb helyszín birtoklása előnyt jelent a győzelemhez.
A játékban bónuszlapkákat is megszerezhetsz, amelyek segítségével joker árucikket vagy extra akciót kapsz, cserélhetsz bármilyen árucikket bármilyen másikra, kockadobás helyett eldöntheted, honnan kezded meg lépéseidet vagy pluszban végrehajthatod birtokolt épületed akcióját.
A játék egyik hiányosságának tartom, hogy ennél jobb szabálykönyveket is láttam már. Sok esetben hosszas kereséssel sem találtunk választ a kérdésünkre, igaz megbeszéltük és úgy játszottunk tovább.
Általában nincs ellenemre egy játékban, ha tárgyalni, alkudozni, licitálni kell, de nekem ez már túl sok (ami nem azt jelenti, hogy mások ezt a részét ne szerethetnék).
Alapvetően korrekt játék, gyors előkészítéssel és egyszerű szabályokkal, rengeteg beszéddel és kufárkodással. Akinek inge, próbálja fel. Nálam az Istanbul sokkal nyerőbb.

I was unprepared for how dynamic and fast-moving this game was. It's amazing how the trading superimposes on a neat resource-management game, and the movement of the tower is simply brilliant. Extremely well done. But, of course, it's highly dependent on the people with whom you're playing, and many people simply take too long.

RATING: 7
Still a somewhat unique negotiating strategy game that lives and dies with the right group. If everyone is greedy, the game will suffer, as it's all about free trading.

Only thing I somewhat dislike are the fat contracts, as they seem to be inferior to the small ones.

However, I like "Chinatown" more, as it's the faster paced game, but without the strategic level of Traders of Genoa. Both are good and different enough, though.

RATING: 6
Yeah, not as great as I first thought.  Downgraded it again (from 7 to 6) when I played it again recently, that makes two downgrades.  It just seems to be close but "not there".  An experienced player who is a bit of a talker can often convince people to make deals to their detriment (and thus doubly benefit themselves), making for an "unhappy" game where people feel fleeced or conned.  Someone who sits back and trys to collect lots of money from deals (without spending much themselves) can also do well, however this requires some good placement of your stack (either through good dice or using a lot of "pick your starting location" tiles).  One thing that can be said for this game is, there are many many ways to pull off the win!  (which is good; but i'm still not inclined to increase my rating)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like games with player interaction. And this one certainly is in that category. Talk with each other, negotiate, make deals. Almost anything goes to let you make money even when it's not your own turn. So you don't have to sit and wait for a full round. Many options and different means to the end make this a very good game. I may promote it to a 9 after a few more games.

A pure trading/negotiation game, where almost everything is up for sale for the right price. There are no set prices for goods or actions so it can be difficult to assess what things are worth.

I also own Chinatown, which in my opinion, is a superior negotiation game - so sadly this doesn't get to the table anymore. But it does create an elegant blend of pure negotiation games with a euro game flavour. And like any good negotiation game, there is no down-time - you always need to be switched on and trying to negotiate your interests into the gameplay. All in all, a solid game.

Fun game.  Seems too long, a little dry, and badly in need of something to do in the middle.  Small kingmaking issue, as just a couple of bad bids can really give one person a lot of cash, but I guess thats to be expected in a negotiating game.  I would like to play again, but I don't think this one is going to be a winner for me.  Solid game though.  Could grow on me.  I dislike that you can't tell who is ahead since it exacerbates king making issues already present...  which is odd since hidden information usually prevents that sort of thing.  I think its fun for all my griping. A little long for the type of game it is.  Its got negotiation but also has some meat - many negotiation games don't have enough meat on their bones to be any fun aside from just screwing around.  This one has some strategy in addition to the bidding.

RATING: 6
This is a game that is all about trading.  Everything is up for trade, including ducats (which are victory points), cards in hand, special cards, goods, rights to perform the current action, and even things which will be earned as a result of taking the current action!

As a result, this game takes a long time.  In a 5-player game, there are a maximum of 35 turns, each of which involves the placement of 5 discs for at least 3-5 actions each turn.  A recent game lasted 30 turns, with 8 minutes per turn = 4 hours!

As a point of strategy, it seems that messages are by far the most efficient way to score points.  You don't have to win an action in a building to score for a message.  So, you get 30 ducats for little cost -- you don't need to pay to win an action, you don't have to collect any goods.  Compare this to 40 ducats for small orders, where you need one good and need to win an action, and 100 ducats plus a special card for large orders, where you need 3 goods from the opposite corners of the board and you need to win the action.  I think the large orders are a bad strategy -- at least with the small orders, you get to take the building's action in addition to delivering your order, whereas you can't take a privilege card if you fulfil a large order.

An effective way to play the messages strategy is to put an owner chit on the post office, and get the "building" special cards as much as possible.  Then you can trade 1:1 for a building special card, which you can then use to activate your post office and get 2 messages, which you may even be able to fulfil this turn.

Another strategy is to use 1:1 special cards early in the game to accumulate privileges.  Just don't spend too much money paying other players for their privileges -- privileges are over-valued and don't usually win the game.  Just hope that you get some contiguous ones and leave it at that.

In my honest opinion, no game does economic negotiation as well as Genoa. The tension is delightful, and right group withstanding, things get nasty over the smallest movement, or the good that is picked.

Fascinating game, in terms of interaction and the wealth of options and strategies. The game is quite unlike anything else I have played, with negotiations and trading being core mechanisms. 

I always find that a "good game" is really not a good way to describe a board game - it is more a matter of finding the right game to suit the particular group of players. If you have a group of extrovert people who like interaction and strategic games with some depth, this could be the right game for you.

This game fascinates me with its variability and its social interraction.  I like the focus on player interaction, which makes every turn and every move important.  It also various methods to victory, allowing you to modify your strategy successfully during play.

The down-side to this game is best described as the difference between an trading game and a negotiation game.  If you focus on good trades, the game can go quickly.  If your group has to negotiate every trade to get the most $5 possible, it can drag out.  For these groups, I would advocate a 3 min. timer.  

While the mechanisms are not difficult, the game has significant numbers of possible actions that must be understood, so players need to be good at moderately complicated rules and a certain amount of ambiguity in play.

trade, manipulate, bluff - this is the engine of the game. How can I persuade my neighbur to make the right move?

I despise negotiation games.  Totally.  Completely.  Thoroughly.  This one, however, worked.  Is it because to me, it's really a bidding game at heart (though sometimes we were bidding on completely different items)?  Dunno, but I liked it enough that I'm going to have to get it (having sold mine once I found it was in the "negotiation" category)

RATING: 5
This is an unsettling game where everything is negotiable. Since I was a newbie, and didn't know the relative value of stuff, I got crushed. I was literally lost for the first half of the game, as I tried to figure out values. It seems I do not like negotiation games--Diplomacy comes to mind. Mind you, I think Diplomacy is a great game, but personally, playing it is painful to me. Traders is similar. ToG is probably a great game too, but again, it does not suit my personality.

Update (01/20/12): My initial rating was a '7'. Upon a long period of reflection, this is a '5'.

The depth of player interaction is simply breathtaking.  Every player has the opportunity to purchase an action during every other players' turn—requiring you to be constantly engaged in the play.  There is no downtime.  Add to this the fact that almost every game piece is a tradeable commodity and you have the ultimate negotiation game.  Highly recommended.

I enjoy playing this game, but the turn by turn negotiations take too long making it a less popular choice.  Neat mechanics and fun gameply though.
Played it a few more times with people who know how to play, and it's great - very fast negotiations.  Sometimes it sucks to be perceived as the winner as people start to enact trade embargoes.

 ** 게임 자체는 교섭 + 경매 요소가 포함되어 있어서
     나쁘지 않다. 하지만 지나치게 교섭 요소가 강한 느낌도
     든다. 특히 4-5 인플일 경우 자기 차례가 아닐 경우
     액션을 수행하지 못하게 되는 (물론 그것이 이 게임의
     미묘한 포인트이겠지만) 경우가 발생하기도 하는데,
    만약 이러한 경우를 자주 당하게 되면 게임이 매우 피곤해
     질 수도 있을 것이다.

    혹 자는 이 게임이 네덜란드 황금시대와 닮았다고 하는데,
    네덜란드 황금시대는 이 게임에 비하면 양반이다.

    시작지역을 주사위로 랜덤으로 정했다는 점이 이 게임의 
     무서운 점이다. 

    시스템 적으로는 안정되어 있으나 플레이어 간의 보이지
    않는 눈치싸움이나 교섭 능력이 요구되는 수준이 높은게임이다.

Dorn stratégiai játéka. A korongokból épített torony adja meg a lehetséges lépésink számát. A kiindulási pontot két kockával határozzuk meg, innen indulhat a tornyunk és minden lépésnél le kell tennünk egyet. Ha egy épülethez érünk, akkor a többiek ajánlhatnak fel pontokat és nyersanyagokat, hogy használhassák az épület képességét. Úgy gondoltam, hogy ez az állandó alkudozás hosszadalmassá teszi a játékot, de nem lett az. Meglepett, hogy két játékossal is működött a játék, de igazából több játékossal jó.

Not for unassertive types!  This is not a game where you can sit back and quietly work your way to victory.  You have to deal with the other players constantly, trying to make sure you pay out as little money as possible to get what you want and collecting as much money as you can from your opponents when the time comes to sell actions on your turn.  I'm not as big a fan of negotiation games, but I still think this one is fun now and then.  I'd rate it higher if it weren't also for the fact that your plans can crumble due to plain old bad luck.

Very clever. I'd somehow expected a little more tension in the negotiations, but I guess this is at least partly a side effect of playing with children.  Knowing the value of the different buildings is quite difficult--at first, at least, it was very easy for me to be far more focused on what I had in my hand rather than what else I might gain on the board. The "start any space" tokens are extremely valuable. I do like the limiting factor of the tower, and it seems like knowing WHEN to negotiate is also a very important part of the game. Is there any way to influence where the tower goes, when you want the third or fourth thing it might hit?

I was kind of disappointed to find I'd won--it makes me think less of the game because I didn't win too many actions, so perhaps they aren't as valuable as they should be.  (1 play)

As Modern Art is the definitive auction game, Genoa is the definitive strategic trading game. Everyone seems to enjoy it. Some just for the trading: "Oh that's nice of you, thank you!", others for the calculating: "If I give you three X and you give me one Y and one Z that would be only 20% better than the other player's offer.".

Unfortunately the rules and board of my edition have some errors which confused us at our first play. Also, Chinatown is a lighter, but even better trading game I fear I will never play this again.

This game is pretty much a perfect storm of things that don't appeal to me - I don't really enjoy wheeling & dealing/negotiation games, bland themes, or gamey for the sake of gamey mechanics (in this case, the "tower" of discs and rolling dice to determine its starting position).  Setting aside all that, I also felt the game dragged on terribly long for what it was.  That said, the fact that I rated this as high as I did is an indication that the game accomplishes what it sets out to do very well; unfortunately what it sets out to do is so far out of my wheelhouse that I don't see myself wanting to play it again.

Played this on June 23rd for the 2nd time.  I didn't seem to like this much years ago for the first play, or at least it being memorable.  Having said that, it was a great gameplay this go around.  There is good luck/strategy balance.  We were watching our 10 month old while playing so it seemed long, however I think it's pretty short (as a 4 player game) perhaps an hour w/o distractions.  It doest take some time to learn, perhaps 15 minutes w/o the distractions.  It's worth picking up for a game play.  It will take about 1/2 a game before you figure out what you are suppose to bid and what strategies to use.  Having said that, you will want to play again.  I'd highly recommend this for a game play.  Chances are it will work into your rotation of games to play every once in a while.  Update: my 3rd game gave me a bad taste for the game.  There were rules that I hadn't played by before and the bidding went completely different.  We were all tired at that point too after over two hours of play.

With the wrong group this game is just endless, pointless neogotiation every step of the way. Also allows over-analyzers to drag their feet. Teaching the rules is a huge painful hurdle. Very few groups I'll this play with anymore, and it's not a lot of fun for all the effort.

Traders is a textbook case of how a negotiation game SHOULDN'T be made.  There is too much hidden information to evaluate decisions and the values of items, too many busy mechanics that don't add anything of substance to the design, and too much restriction on how to go about executing a goal.  Add to the fact, it is way too long and entirely too abstracted.  I mean giant "trading towers" that collapse orthagonally around a town executing auctions that must be made if an offer is bid?  WTF?  This is one of those games that is supposed to wow people with it's "depth" and "elegance," but in my mind it is completely without both.

This is really the king of negotiation games.  It would be hard to get to the table, but it might still be worth owning.

It does a very good job of keeping everyone involved all the time.  There is very little noticeable downtime. 

Apr 08: Hard to get to the table though.  I always shudder at trying to explain all the rules.  Always seems like he included 1 or 2 two many buildings to me.  The discovery of Quo Vadis also hurt this game a decent amount.  QV is so much smoother.

Traders of Genoa was already on my wishlist for some time, and I really really had to own this game when I saw that QWG was going to re-release it. I bought it the very same day the new version was released :-)
It's a beautifull game, even though I was initially disappointed to see that the goods markers were not nearly of the same quality as the board.

First couple of games with 5 players. First time round, the rules were a little unclear in places and the game was overlong. But these problems were less evident in the second game. Traders of Genoa is a well-balanced game offering many tactical and strategic choices. The relatively open nature of the negotiating works well. UPDATE: a third game was easily won by a player who chose a strategy based on owner markers: he began by placing one of his owner markers on the Cathedral and used its Building Action several times throughout the game to collect more markers.

A nice negotiation game. Can be something of a let down if the the athmosphere is too antagonistic or greedy but so long as people keep making deals it tends to chug along quite nicely.

It's one of those games which will have its die hard followers and haters as well.

This game is all about negotiations.  If you don't like this aspect of gaming, don't you even try ToG.  For me it's great game although I'm not much of a fan of sheer negotiating.  I might like it so much, because there is also element of cunning planning.  Combination of these elements works GREAT here.

Warning - it can be 'don't know what to think' at first, but this title gets better with every game (and even with every hour of play).

EDIT: I've lost heart for this game.  Somehow I'm not hot on playing almost 100% negotiation games any more...
The game is good, so my rating might be unfair, but it just reflects my will to play the game...

This is an enjoyable negotiation game but the downside is the lengthy downtime involved in making/considering deals, especially if you're not involved in it. Personally, I'd rather play Chinatown or Bohnanza if I'm in the mood for negotiation. 

The game length variability drives me nuts!!  It could theorically be over in less then a dozen turns (depnds on number of players) or it could last forver!  I played in a 2-player game that we played for an hour or two for FIVE nights in a row!  With two turns still left, we both had over $5,000. We had to revert to writing down every time we each reached another $1k since we kept running out of money. It wasn't really any fun and you discover how repetitious the game can be. 

My main piece of advice, and my game group will completely agree, is to NOT play this after midnight. Tired grumpy people just don't make good friendly negotiators. Trust me...

I like the game but there needs to be a way to limit the length when the dice won't cooperate. Otherwise I'd rate this game as at least a seven.

THE Negotiation Game. Many paths to victory, attractive components, tough decisions to make, tons of player interaction, and no "kill the leader" factor since it's near impossible to tell who's ahead. No make-or-break randomness. Best of all, there's no downtime because all players are constantly involved; none of this "let me know when it's my turn" rubbish.

The negotiation aspect is interesting, but it's very hard to know what something is worth.  This game seems very dependant on the other people you're playing with - if they're not wheeling & dealing kind of players, this would be a pretty dull game.

This trading game is more complicated than some to teach, but quickly makes sense with play.  (I first played it with kids in the 11-13 range, and they figured it out quickly.)

RATING: 6
My feelings are still mixed on this one after a few games. On one hand I find the game quite long and repetitive for what it is. Luck, both with regards to the start-of-turn dice rolls, and the "will your opponents be persuaded by your offers" kind of luck plays a big part, so I personally find it hard to formulate any kind of coherent strategy. It is of course also a hard-core negotiation game, and while this in itself isn't a negative thing, it's something I am not as fond of as I used to be...

That being said, the game does have a lot going for it, IMHO: I like the whole "setting" of the game, ie. trading to make money in a historical context, the fact that there are multiple ways of getting income, and the host of various abilities the buildings and special cards give you are all very well thought out.

Personally I think I would enjoy this more if it had a shorter playing time and less negotiation. :)

Initial Rating: 8.5 (October 2011)

I love negotiation games so I really like Genoa, one of the best negotiations games I have played. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in the game is up for trade which is a nice feature but this can cause some people to take very long turns. 

What sets Genoa apart from other negotiation games (like Chinatown which I enjoy) is the hidden information, in Genoa you are not sure how much value holds many of the deals until the end of the game so you need to calculate carefully to succeed in this game and this makes the game a lot more complex. I LOVE IT. 

Another good feature is that you have different paths to victory, unlike many negotiation games. The only down (for some people) is the long game time, it can be easy over 3 hours. If you like negotiation games this is one of the best.

Bottom line, Genoa is a blast but only with the right group as this one is very group dependent.  Try it before buy it.

It’s been years since I last played Genoa, and I have changed a lot during this time. I still have fond memories of the game and I would gladly play it again to see how it stands now, but my desire to play it again had diminished a lot. I still like negotiation games, but not as much as before. They tend to have lots of downtime, a sin I have come to despise. Due to this I’m downgrading its rating.

Still enjoyable with just two, though better with more players.  Plenty of player interaction and a variety of strategies toward victory.

My rating goes up after realizing that we were playing the game incorrectly.  (We assumed that the 1:1 cards let you trade only the wares, not realizing that anythin in your possession is a tradable commodity.)  This game can suffer from "over-talk," but if your group cannot seem to move along on their own, set a time limit for a move, or a turn.  The interaction during all phases of the game makes it more appealing than other long turn-based games.  (BTW for a 5 player game, 120 minutes is a bit on the short side.  More like 150-180 minutes.) This now ranks with PR and Princes of Florence on my list, with the small drawback of the time involved.

This is my favourite game in the alea 'big box' line.  Definitely my favourite trading game, and one of the best 'hose your neighbour' games of all time.  The 120+ minute play time is the only thing that keeps it from being rated higher.  If you like deal making... this game is for you.

Everything in the game is tradeable!  All cards, tokens, etc. can be worked into any deal you can think of.  A big plus is that you can play it Active... "I want 'x' to move here, or I'm ending my turn!" or Passive... "How much am I offered to go here?"

Tower movement is key to the game.   And, with hidden money, you are never sure who is ahead... a nice plus for everyone with a poor memory like mine.

Interesting game.  People who like the trading aspect of Settlers of Catan should also like Traders of Genoa.  In ToG, you trade money, cards, and/or goods (basically anything in the game) to be able to take actions during another players turn.  This means that when it's your turn, you're trying to earn a pretty good payout. Determining WHERE to move your 'workers' is important to ensure a bidding war.  There are also multiple tracks to earn money (big orders, small orders, messages, privilieges, owner tokens).  The 120 minute play time overstays its welcome a bit.  But each player's turn is interactive in that players are bidding on where to move the 'workers'  so it goes by without much downtime.

I still prefer Settlers (especially with the Cities and Knights expansion).


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Although I really enjoy negotiation games, ToG leaves me flat. I feel that there is simply too much unknowable information to assess the value of most of the deals. And the one deal that has any transparency at all - the large order - is pretty well telegraphed. I prefer Chinatown, which also has the virtue of being considerably quicker.

RATING: 9
This is a fantastic game! There is quite a bit of strategy, with multiple means to victory. You need the right group to play, since bartering and deal makinging is essential to a good play through.

I gave my copy of this game to a friend to start his collection off right, but would play this anytime.

All trading all the time. If the negotiations kept a brisk pace this game would be played more. But it tends to clock in at 2.5 hours which is a bit on the long side for me. I've also come to dislike the negotiations. Without knowing what a player is looking to get out of a negotiation you have no idea what the fair value of the item is to him. In other negotiation games fair value is a bit clearer and therefore those games are  less irritating to me.

I have to say this much for the game, it's pretty unique. The game board is a map of the town center, with streets and buildings, placed on an 8x8 grid. A typical player's turn consists of taking control of the "tower" (a stack of 5 disks), rolling two 8-sided dice to see where in the town the tower is initially placed, and then moving the tower to adjacent spaces, leaving behind one disk in each space, making a trail of disks across the grid. When the tower is placed in a building, the action associated with that building usually takes place. After the tower is finished spreading across town, the turn ends and the tower is given to the next player.

What's unique? Every single move the tower makes can be negotiated with the player controlling the tower. The controlling player can only take one of the five possible actions the tower placement allows, so the rest can be sold off to the highest bidder. Players use money, goods, ownership tiles, order cards, special actions cards, and non-binding promises in order to influence the active player to give the next action to them. That's right. EVERY action taken in the game is open to negotiation. The object is to finish with the most money. Money is made primarily by meeting certain objectives on your hand of order cards (large orders, small orders and messages). You can also place ownership tiles on buildings which gives you some money when someone else uses that action and gives you a bit of money at the end of the game. There are also privilege cards with buildings on them that you can collect, hoping to build sets of adjacent buildings for end game bonuses.

The heart of the game are the negotiations that get you the things you need to make money. If you don't like negotiations, you will HATE this game. If negotiations are your favorite aspect of gaming, you will likely love it. Fans of this game say that the longer the game takes, the better it is, because that means the negotiations are getting difficult and complex. 

When we played we didn't get very creative with our negotiations and the game dragged, taking on a repetitive, samey quality. It also didn't help that I basically won the game by rolling the perfect placement on my final turn, enabling me to complete a large order without paying, and winning by $15.

This is turning out to be the fave with my group of gamers. The high level of player interaction makes it busy for everyone (no downtime) and it can be absolutely riotous fun. I have had more outright hilarity and fun with this game than any other i've played - for that reason i've increased my rating to a 9. Update, played recently and it felt a little tired. Back to an 8.

The game is a great negotiation engine but I guess I found that I only like negotiation games where the scope of them is narrower and built more into the rules of the game like Basari or Edel, Stein & Reich.  My experience with the open ended nature of the negotiations in this game was that they could completely bog the game down.  After a couple of frustratingly quagmired experiences, I just could not bring myself to bring my copy of this game to my game group again and eventually traded it away.

A negotiation game that drags one as each person bargains for each time the active player moves.  Mechanics are fine.  The idea of having other players engaged during the other person's turn is great.  We just found that everyone is too engaged and negotiation never ended.  Play Istanbul for a streamlined version of the mechanic of moving your stack of merchants.

Played it once with 'the right group'. Excellent. Played more like an auction game than negotiating, but we played fast and furious. 5 players and finished in 2 hours. Nice components, wonderful mechanics. I thought I was vying for last place but came in third. Why? While one player kept delivering large orders, I kept getting money from owned buildings. Varying strategies abound.

UPDATE: played several times. Enjoy the game and so does the group. We do not get bogged down with deals. After a few playings the deal making turned from 'auction' to negotiating. Everyone makes an offer and the player picks the one he likes (which is not always the best deal, since you do not want to help someone in the lead too much).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A refreshingly different game of negotiations compared to current Euros when experienced first almost 10 years after its release. Almost everything is negotiable in this game in a time when auctions are the name of the game. Nonetheless, Container comes to mind as a relative (more the free market aspect than the mechanisms) although Traders of Genoa has more structure and is less prone to collusion or players throwing the game randomly. But as all negotiation games it suffers from difficulty to get it to the table and experience being essential for getting the full potential out of it. Definitely one for experienced players.

I enjoyed this much more than I anticipated.  It was very difficult to visualize how the game would play after only reading the rules, but it really comes to life once you start playing.  I don't know if I would want to play with less than 4, 5 seems like the ideal number.  I can also see that group dynamics and personalities can really affect one's enjoyment of the game.  It seems like you have to be at least moderately cooperative and not a total jerk to get anywhere in the game, but I'd like to see how different people play.  Definitely fun, one I'd like to play a lot more.

A long and draggy negotiation game. Group dynamics are really important here, because with the wrong type of people playing, the game loses its fun factor. There isn't much long-term strategy to the game, it has more to do with updating your plans with wherever the tower lands. As far as game length goes, I thought it went for an hour too long.

The Trading Game.In this game everything is a trade,you have to trade each space that your tower travel on and you can do a lot of things and a lot of action(but you're normally limited to one a turn except you got something that allow you to perform special action...)One manage the tower deals with other players accepting bribes to move the tower to a location to allow them to do that action or choose to take the action himself.Very good very replayable very enjoyable.One of the classic that should be in every and each collection of games.

A lot of haggling goes on during this frantic trading game.  A person can make clever plays, but there are also some effective strategies to pursue, in spite of various random factors.

Definitely many things to think about AND different things have a different values for each player. If you like negotiation games this is for you, for me this is too much. I mean its too long (this is the biggest problem), too "random" and a very difficult to see what is the best for you (or your opponents). For me Bohnanza is enough when it's time to play negotiation games.

Nice, well rounded game with lots of trading, light planning and more tactics than strategy.  Rules are simple enough but getting a real hang of the game can take quite a few plays.  Good for regular groups who can invest a little.

RATING: 8
Optimum number to play is with five (with the right group) but also ok with four if you like negotiation games (play I'm The Boss/KK&K if you've got six).  Playing with new players or long debaters will add considerable length to game time...

I still think this is one of the better trading/negotiation games out there but I find negotiation games difficult to get to the table and so off it goes to someone who might play more often!

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Wow!  This has got to be the best negotiation/trading game out there.  The all encompassing aspects of being able to trade practically anything and with many different ways to earn money as well is almost intimidating on the first play.  Still not sure value wise what everything is worth...and since its often worth more to someone else, makes life even more difficult.  Word to the wise - don't let anyone get too many privilege cards, those can add up in a hurry.  Also, be prepared to be sitting for quite a while, particularly on your first play as you seek to figure out the many varied nauances to the game.  Just remember, whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting negotiation game that has a unique feel.  It's difficult to gauge the relative values of different actions, and it's generally a tense struggle to actualize the plan once you've decided upon a specific course of action that seems tactically beneficial.  Like many games with so much player interaction, it can run a bit long.

RATING: 8
Robust, engrossing experience.  The system is front-loaded with a number of rules that serve to ratchet down the system and ensure it doesn't devolve into a chaotic, Pit-style bazaar.  The trick is to make the most creative, beneficial deals within the rules straightjacket.  The worth of ALL wares and cards are constantly changing throughout the game and must be re-evaluated according to the in-game situation.  As in real economics, the greatest assest in this game is OPPORTUNITY.

My concern is that in a game between equally shrewd players, the victory will be handed to the player who finds the last significant windfalls in the form of Small Orders he can already fill with the goods in his supply, or Messages he can deliver in a chain, or indeed to the player who got the best Privilege cards.  If my suspicion is correct, ToG can almost be said to be an "experience game".  But what an experience!

maybe I'm just green, but this game is amazing.  In a 3-player game, I snookered one player out of his priviledge card early, then went on to collect another 7.  Won solidly on an 8-building run when we rolled the marketplace in the 2nd to last round.  Tons of room for different strategies and evolving commodity values.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is the very best negotiation game every made.  The fundamental mechanic is how the actions tower moves.  You negotiate for additional actions each round. There are myriad of different building each providing resources, contracts, special cards, building control, etc.  

You have to have a rule thought that negotiations for any given move can only be 30-60 sec.  If you cannot make a quick deal you move the tower.  If people are going to argue over every little deal, the game will take forever.  

The other difficulty with the game is people cannot always determine the value for some of the goods.   You need to tell players about the possible value associated with the large contract buildings.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The multitude of options for turning a profit obscure the value of actions and the overall leader.  The structured negotiations feel almost like an auction mechanic.  Needs to be played at a decent pace or it can be a little too long.

RATING: N/A
Pure negotiation game typically clocking in at 1-3 hours with 3 hours not being uncommon (although rated at 120 min and can be played as short as 45 min). A LOT of begging, convincing, and other forms of negotiation is at play here. One reviewer mentioned that he has played games going as long as 5 hours!!!

Reviews have been outstanding. Contrast to QUO VADIS, a tighter and lighter pure negotiation game w/quicker play, where you know where you stand before the end of the game.

Although it pales in comparison, CHINATOWN does have some negotiation and plays much faster. It would seem to be much more suited to casual games and, as such, would likely see it's way to the gaming table more often than ToG. It also incorporates a Settlers of Catan and Acquire element into the theme (i.e., acquiring properties that have value and produce goods - I think?); which is not necessarily a positive point if one is looking for a pure negotiation game. (In such a case, that's where one would look towards QUO VADIS as a ToG substitute).

It's been suggested to play with open money and scoring.

NOT a game for newcomers or folks younger than the stated 12 y/o.

This review makes the game a MUST have

7/2006: A very interesting bidding game.  Unlike Chinatown (also by Alea) one cannot easily calculate the value of a deal up-front.  The value of an action/good is very individual and hidden.

RATING: 8
After 12 years this game is still the ultimate trading game. Everything can be traded with minimal set of rules makes this game simply the best in the genre. The pricing system has some sort of autoregulatory mechanism so the price would change as the board position change. This is not easily recognised by new players, though.
Tha downsides?
1. It may be exceptionally long esp played with new-gamers;
2. In contrary to most modern europe designs where superior strategy is going to win the game, this game has some similiarity to party games in which communication plays a vital role in both enjoying and winning the game.

I really enjoyed playing this game.  It's hard to keep track of exactly what is going on and I didn't exactly like not knowing who the point leader is, but that is part of the mystique.  Play your turn right with the tower and that will make all the difference in the game.  I believe this is a well thought out game.  I would like to see the bidding time for actions cut down some how for time purposes... but that's just a minor issue.  Also ensure you play this game with the right people.

I bought this game by accident some years ago (thinking it was Princes of Florence), so I traded it away. (They looked too much alike!) More recently, I decided to buy it again and actually play this time. Of course, it was out of print. I have a copy after much hassle and I could kick myself for ever having traded it away. This is an amazing game -- equal or better than it's counterparts in the Alea Big Box series. It is a far better game than Princes of Florence!

The best part of this game is that all comodities can be traded with -- not only wares and money, but also messages, orders, privileges, owner markers, and special cards. And with the 1:1 special card you don't even need another player!

Furthermore, there is virtually no downtime, constant player interaction, no leader advantage or disadvantage(!) and there are lots of tactical and even some strategical decisions to be made.

"If you go to the postoffice and allow me to make my action, then I'll give you one of the messages..."
"And I let you even pick which one..."
"OK, thank you, then I use this 1:1 card to exchange this silk for a building action card, which I then use to pick up a salt and a pepper, because I have an owner marker there. Oh, and I use the salt to deliver this small order to the postoffice!"

Un juego en que cada movimiento es una transacción; debido a eso, puede durar más tiempo del normal. REGALADO a Paulo.
Puede gustar a quienes el regateo y el negociado es su fuerte. El que esté más atento a negociar (tras una estrategia básica predefinida), va a ganar.
Las vías iniciales para ganar son muchas; pero es en la negociación y en determinar la ganancia que cada negociación implica (costos menos valor de transacción), donde se decide quien termina con más dinero, que es el objetivo del juego.

El juego se lo regalé a mi hermano, para su matrimonio.
UPDATE: mayo 2005....me da lata jugarlo, porque obliga, igual que Los Colonos de Catán, a estar regateando el movimiento de la torre en cada segundo del juego. Prefiero los juegos más sosegados y no con tanta negociación.

Interesting game with a lot of different strategies to explore, and the need to stay always on your toes to react to what other people are doing. Highly interactive and in fact more negotiation-based that I was expecting: the rules suggested there was a spatial element to this that didn't really come across in the game. Seems to run a little long because the endgame falls a bit flat - everyone can see the end coming and so is usually just tying things up by that stage. Amusingly it also offers a mini-lesson in the advantages and pitfalls of capitalism. The biggest issue with the game is that experienced players can start to make quite accurate judgements about the value of given trades, which makes it more mathematical and less intuitive to play.

2. Very good negotiation game.
3. Good game mechanics. Good relationship between various resources of the game.
4. Probable high replayability.
5. Good amount of decisions, both strategic and tactical.

I really want to like this game, but the grid seems slightly too big...the choices too many...the possibility of accomplishing my goals too impossible...first play wasn't much fun for us.  I think I enjoyed reading the rules more than the actual play.  I'm determined to give this another go, but the sheer length of it has turned off my family from the desire to join me.

German Edition. Did play the English reprint and I'm not too keen on it. 3 person game went on a long time with a lot of just waiting to see if anyone wants to bid on an action. The whole super-openness to the trading seemed like a little more constraints would have helped it out. Not for me or my group but I can see why some people would love it for exactly the reasons I do not.

It took me a long time to get to this one and I'm kind of bummed on missing out for so long.  This is a fine game though and basically forces you to negotiate with the other players in order to make any progress.  I highly recommend it.

>It is excellent except my friends feel that the game is too long. But it could be resolved by playing less rounds.

08/09/05 Played one three-player game of The Traders of Genoa. It was OK, but nothing to write home about.
01/31/12 Played three-player the newly reissued version merely called Genoa. My opinion hasn't changed - "eh". I'd play it again if my arm was twisted, but I'd certainly never ask for it. Hopefully that won't be for another 6.5 years!

Played once. Good game, but all this talking and negotiating: it will not become one of my favorites. Play the Meister version, when you have all cards at hand and a mission for all to fulfill. That way you totally ban the luck-factor.

A tad frustrating, as the tower always seemed to start the opposite side of the board to where I needed to be. More plays might change my rating, we shall see.
Update: 3 player game, went much better. We got one rule wrong in the first game and it changed the game completely. Want to play again..........soon.
Played again, still couldn't win but had a great time.  Time really fly's when you are playing.

Very good negotiation game.  It can takes a little bit of experience to know the true value of something but after a while, you really get involve in your dealings.  The Privileges cards are a very real possible strategy, so don't count it out.

Seems ok. After we played a few turn, we managed to get along nicely. Not much strategies since most of the time, when the tower player took control, you couldn't do much. There was 4 of us and almost every turn, someone couldn't play, so maybe bidding would have more effect with 5 players. Would still try it again, but not in any hurry. But with the special cards, often, the tower player was making much of the decision, so bidding had not much effect, except if it was going where the tower player was going or had nothing left to do this turn. Might be better with practice, okay for now.

Initial rating: Trading game for gamers. In my first 5-player game I seemed to be the only one who really enjoyed all the various options and flexible gameplay. I thought it was good fun for heckling gamers, they thought it was unnecessarily complicated. Game took a bit too long thanks too some slow negotiating though. So it's the kinda game you don't want to play with anyone except gamers...

NL: onderhandelspel waarbij vrijwel alles onderhandelbaar is, en waarbij er genoeg keuze's zijn om je bij je 1e spel over in verwarring te brengen over wat nou handig is, wat je nou waar voor moet betalen etc. Desondanks vind ik het een erg goed spel.

I dropped this down to an 8. It doesn't work as well, it seems, as an ending to 4 to 6 hours of gaming. The last few rounds seemed to drag even though it was only about an hour and a half in. The whole game took almost two hours, which isn't that long since two players were new. I enjoyed the game, but I had the idea that few others were ready to call it quits. It seems the game starts pretty strong but if the tower doesn't start at the market (or if a player doesn't hurry the game by choosing that), there is a lull at about round 5. The end scoring (if not hurried by a closing coffee shop) is not bad and typical of many "euros."

I wish I could find people that really enjoy the game because I really like to play this one very competitively. Or maybe that's the problem :) .

Bought this one based on positive reviews.  Reading the rules for the first time, I was immediately intrigued by the tower movement/negotiation mechanic and could not wait to give it a play.  The mechanics work just as well in practice as they sound on paper. First play was very enjoyable -- lots of animated, but not prolonged negotiation. We were perhaps bidding a little higher than we should have been, and the player who bid the least ended up winning.  Second play was a little more subdued -- perhaps bidding lower than true values, and the player who bid the most (me) won.  Look forward to more plays to better learn how much to offer.  Another one of those games where you want to do a lot more than you can, leading to some interesting decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I wasn't very keen on playing this because of the ugly art work and because some people here on BGG wrote that it takes them 4 - 5 hours to play. We played a game with five players including three people who rarely play anything and it worked like a charm. A wonderful negotiation game at least with five players. I definitely want to play this more!

RATING: 5
Big disapointement. Remarkably stale for a trading game. While there was some negotiation going on, there is more action in Bonhanza than in this game. We couldn't figure out how the small orders were supposed to be worth anything - costs too much to bribe someone to move to the ressources, then to buy the action, then to move to the drop zone, then bribe to take an action there. If you make 20$ profit on the small orders, you're an excellent trader. Similar problems with the messages. With so many rules for such a small payoff, I'm not sure that this will hit the table all that often.

Runs the risk of playing long, given that every turn is a full-table negotiation, but for snappy players it's quite interesting. Visually it's a cross between Istanbul and Princes of Florence.

Oh, it's an auction game. You can almost bid on everything concern the game: movement, token, cards, ecc. If you like auction you'll enjoy for sure
I'm not very fond of auction game (I lose every time I play ;-) ); anyway, it's not a bad game, but in his category I like more Ra or Noblesse Oblige
It's a bit hard mastering and explain the rules.

I like the constant player interaction, but this game often results in the tower controller going for his own preferred action anyway. Meanwhile there are too many options and too many rules here, and the game is very, very long.

I have the Traders of Genoa version.

An excellent trading/negotiation game.  Nearly every move of every turn requires bartering of some sort.  Couple that with all of the available goods and there is little or no downtime for anybody.  Every single piece, card and resource is up for trade.  Great stuff here.

I think I've gotten pretty good at teaching games...even tough ones.  There is something about ToG that is a pain to teach.  It always takes TOO long to get going.  Perhaps it is just lots of finicky rules which feel a bit uncertain at times.  Perhaps it is a case of feeling like there are too many rules to govern what is really a simple game.  Anyone else with me on this???

Aside from that gripe, this game is pretty alright.

Traded away the original Rio Grande printing. Now have a copy of the recent edition.

A tight, tense experience with the right group. As with all negotiation & trading games, the flexibility in the rules allows for some interesting situations - an economy and valuation that mutates over the course of the game. It must ABSOLUTELY be played in the right spirit - otherwise stupid crap like kingmaking can occur which defeats the whole point of the game.
------------------------------
This game has become a real hit with the childrens at school. I suspect they like the highly interactive nature of it. It's not quite as fun for me when playing with them because they often don't think carefully about their trades will often readily agree to things that they shouldn't, but the fact that they had enough of a good time with this to order it for themselves is very telling. This game is doing something right.

My respect for this game increases every time I play it. The strategy is complex, and varies considerably depending on what other people are doing, as does the excitement. If every trade has nothing but cash, and people are only offering 5-10 ducats, it can be pretty dry, but if people are consistently inventing creative deals with multiple types of assets, the game really shines.

This is a game that is a little on the heavy side, but it is all player interaction, negotiation, and is tight. 

You are trying to generate profit by trading with other players in a city, delivering goods, obtaining favors, and sending letters from one place to another.

Money is kept secret and the gameplay is subtle. Gameplay is 60-120 mins, and it would probably be closer to 120 for us.

Would need to play with the right group.

The more I play this game the more I like it. It's very impressive to realize that you can be very creative during the negotiations and come up with deals that are mutually (if not equally) profitable with both of the trading players. And the more deals you manage to make the more you increase your possibilities for a good result of even the victory in the end. Also a big plus of the game is that the setup is very easy and doesn't take too much time. The rules are rather easy to grasp once you have seen them in an example of play. So, when playing with new players I usually play one round with them so that they learn the rules and then we start the normal game.

This has slowly risen to the top of my personal preferences. It's a game I'm not that good at, but it's always a blast to play this. Never had problems of slow negotiations or long games... this is one of those game you always feel like you're doing somethin, no downtimes, and a lot of subtleness involved. The two players variant is better than most 2 players game out there... it really shines, even if this doesn't seem like a game you would like to play in two.

I don't normally say this about many games, but Genoa feels obsolete. There are so many other games that do what this game sets out to accomplish in better ways. This game feels very slow-paced, dated, and a little too equal in how everything is distributed. For me, Tiny Epic Kingdoms scratches a lot of the same itches, even though it's quite a bit different in its approach. Unless you're new to the world of Euro games, there's not a lot to see here that hasn't already been improved elsewhere. Even then, I'd rather point people to other more recent games.

Would rather play Tiny Epic Kingdoms.

It looks promising on paper, and in reality the first few turns are amazing, but to keep bargaining is something quite tiresome especially when you see people bargaining for 5 minutes just for a 5 ducats discount. The game also takes too long if the market hasn't been hit 2-3 times.

RATING: 5
Traders of Genoa is the best negotiation game I've played, and for that it deserves to be in just about anyone's collection.  The multiple paths to victory, the interaction of all the mechanics, everything works together really well.  There are tough decisions to be made, and then you have to learn the tendencies of your opponents and try to convince them to do what's best for you.

Where this game will succeed or fail for a group is the type of players in the group.  More than anything, this is a game that is dependant upon the group for success.  People have to be willing to negotiate in good faith and not take anything personally when it doesn't work out.  With people who know what they are doing and are into the negotiations, this game is great.  But without the right people, it will suffer.

My current favorite.  Many paths to victory, attractive components, tough decisions to make, tons of player interaction, and no "kill the leader" factor since it's near impossible to tell who's ahead.  Best of all, there's no downtime because all players are constantly involved;  none of this "let me know when it's my turn" rubbish.

This game drives me crazy. It takes awhile to explain to others, but once they get the concept it picks up well. It's enjoyable, and you think you're really getting somewhere, but by the end it's always a close call. It seems unclear how to get an edge, almost random. Maybe that's just because I never win. =] Good substitute for when you can't get enough people for Diplomacy.

Rating will likely go up with repeated play.

--update--
...and it has.  Long, but definitely good stuff here.  All trading all the time - if you get joy from orchestrating convoluted trades in Settlers then you should run to get this in your collection ASAP. 

--update--
This doesn't hit the table enough because it needs a very specific combination of players for the game to stay fun.  But if that combination can be found the open negotiations are a blast and really shine.

Maybe the best negotiation game I've played, but subject to the flaws of negotiation (those being the people negotiating).  Despite my group making clearly poor trades, thus letting one player amass an unbeatable collection of location cards for almost nothing, I still really enjoyed this game.  Hint to negotiators: a card is not simply what it's worth to you, it's worth what the other person will pay.

After one play with 5 enjoyed this alot. I came last but because everyone is involved on every turn it was a trading game I like. Esp as you can trade what ever you like even diferent types of resources. Needs  more than one play as much easier to play than explain at the begining so took us new players over half hour of questioning what if?

A mildly fun Euro, one I would probably have loved a year or two ago ago. But having played so many games recently that are more fun, it wouldn't be one I'd suggest today. 12 years after publication, the table stakes seem to be higher for board games of this length.

Now that it's been a month since I played it, I look back at the game with more fondness and want to play again. That's a mark of a good game! Upping rating by 1 point for this.

Ugghh.. I love trading/negotiating games but this was just... awful. If I want to play these kinds of games, my picks are Bohnanza and Chinatown.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It's hard to determine the value of everything, since people need different items. I think the value of not giving other players actions is important. Sometimes it might be best to just do one thing for yourself and not give other people actions on your turn. Letting one player have many privilege cads is probably not a good idea, since those points can really add up. It seems there are several possible paths to victory, but it's hard to tell if one is stronger than another.

RATING: 8
This is the heavy pure negotiation / trading game for me and I'm not even too much of a fan of the genre. Some randomness and luck eventually comes from dice but making good deals will be in bigger part when determining the winner. Literally every imaginable thing is for sale on Genoa (if you name the right price). Plays well with four and five players. Probably best with four but equally good with five even though trading will take a little bit longer with more players involved.

Bellissimo gioco di commercio e scambi. Abbastanza semplice nelle meccaniche anche se probabilmente la prima partita sarà di ambientazione. Con la giusta compagnia il gioco potrebbe trasformarsi in un party game caciarone e di contestazione, con offerte pazze e urla in perfetto stile mercato dei carrugi di Genova. Lo trovo ideale in 5 giocatori. Gioco che non premia la strategia (comunque presente) ma l'abilità oratoria e di persuasione. Ho visto di quegli scambi che voi umani non potete immaginare...

RATING: 5
Ultimately, rather disappointing. I was sold this game as a 'step up on Chinatown', but in fact it's nothing of the sort. In essence, it's too long and too fiddly, the player interaction feels woefully forced, and the economy and frivolous 'does this take an action or not'-type exchanges are flawed. I would take Chinatown every time over this.

I deeply love negotiation games, and I deeply love Rudiger Dorn games, and for these two frivolous reasons only is this not rated a 4.

I have wanted to try The Traders of Genoa for long time. Unfortunately it didn't fulfill expectations. Too long a play, boring, low gameplay. First play is only for testing rules, because players give too high bids during an auction and they often overpay for goods, but I don't want to play next game...

RATING: 8
I really like this game. There are the multiple paths to victory, lots of player interaction, and it's just plain fun. 

However, it has its issues. First, it needs to have at least four players to make the trading and bargaining enjoyable. Secondly, you need to have the right group of players. There is a big learning curve with this game and if  everyone isn't at about the same level, the fun factor drops. 

Its the second best Alea big box, behind PoF.

Fun, medium weight and quick weeknight game to play! I wish we had pulled this one out to play sooner! I really find this game to be easy to learn, teach, and remember the rules for play! It is a great 2-player experience and I can't wait to try it with more players...the game should be even better I suspect! Genoa's ancestor might be Puerto Rico and it might even be the predecessor to cooperative games! The game play almost feels cooperative in bargaining with the Tower player! I really enjoy trying to convince the Tower player to travel to places I want to go...sweetening the deal with goods and money! The game does not feel cutthroat at all and makes for a great two player game!

心得:
兩人應該玩不出嘴砲的精隨
遊戲主要是收集物品完成訂單或是完成特定路線計分卡
放置圓片路徑應該是遊戲的特色
真的要嘴砲應該蠻熱鬧的遊戲
規則:
*回合標記根據人數放圖版左邊對應位置，五種特殊版塊，8個貨物放在圖版標示的各個建築上，卡牌分類洗勻也放在對應的位置上
*每個玩家選一個顏色放對應的擁有者六腳柱在圖版對應位置，拿一個對應顏色的板塊記錄你的顏色，每種卡每個玩家抽一張跟130元(錢是隱藏資訊)，隨機起始拿起始標記
*遊戲根據玩家人數進行不同輪數，每輪每個玩家會輪流擔任主動玩家一個回合後該輪結束，一個主動玩家回合分成四個階段，該輪結束回合標記下移，如果回合標記移動時在最後一格以下遊戲結束計分
1.主動玩家丟兩顆色，決定五個疊起的行動原片起始座標
2.移動，行動，談判  此階段主動玩家決定如何移動起始原片，每個建築物或街道格算一格，每次移動只能到相鄰沒原片的地點，且要留一塊在原地點，最多四步可不移動，移動到建築可執行行動，此階段每個玩家只能執行一次行動，所以藉由談判給予任意資源(錢，物品，卡片，特殊版塊，擁有標記等)來執行行動
*談判時要遵守，如果走到建築物後且以人提供交易品，你如果不能執行就一定要答應，交易時不能用未來行動來交易，但可以用該行動獲得的東西交易
3.獲取建築物 照主動玩家開始順位，每人可以選擇一個在街道的原片放一個擁有者標記在相鄰的建築物上(相鄰兩個時可放兩個)，放完原片移除，之後換人
*如果要放的建築物有標記，可支付一個標記移除之，之後在放，一個原片相鄰兩個建築可一次放兩個
*遊戲中只要其他人(你自己不算)在你有標記的建築行動你就從銀行拿10元，遊戲最後也會拿10元
4.回合結束 移動回合標記向下一格
*遊戲結束 每個場上擁有者標記拿10元，然後展示契約卡拿對應金錢，錢最多的贏，平手比剩下的貨物特殊版塊跟手牌和
*遊戲中手牌無上限，都是隱藏的
***2人特殊規則***
*每次交易一定要提供一種物品(貨物特殊版塊或卡片)，不能只有錢
*主動玩家可執行兩個建築物行動，如果另一個玩家有做一個行動的話
***建築物行動列表***
>Guild hall 抽1大訂單卡，必須使用對應villa跟對應3貨物來完成獲得100元
>city hall/post office  抽兩張對應的卡片
*小訂單只要玩家在上面對應的建築執行行動時，就可以返還貨品來完成拿40元(一次行動只能送一筆)，信差卡要此回合移動圓片有在對應個兩個建築物上可馬上打出完成(不用你是主動玩家)
>cathedral 拿兩個擁有者標記
>特殊版塊區  拿一個特殊版塊放面前
>倉庫區 兩種貨物各拿一個放面前
>Villas 抽一張契約卡或是完成大合約
*契約卡根據上面的建築物是否相鄰拿對應金額，越多相鄰越多錢
>中央市場  每有行動，但是如果起始位置在這裡則回合軌向下移動一格
**特殊行動版塊 拿到後可選擇什麼時候使用
>任意起始位置 當你要丟骰時可改成放到指定位置
>額外行動 在執行行動階段時可丟棄之，此回合行動上限數+1
>任意貨物 在自己行動前中後可使用拿任意一個貨物
>建築行動 使用時機同上，可馬上使用有你標記的建築物行動，不能用來完成小訂單，不算在此回合行動上限內
>交易 時機同上，可1換1(特殊卡、貨物指示物、所有人指示物及遊戲卡)

This did not go over well when I tried to play with my family.

RATING: 7
The game promotes some dull and frustrating moments along the way when you have little interest in the current stalled negotiations - although there's always the fun option of table talking the current tower mover out of doing something good for someone else.

The whole game is talk, talk, talk ... talk, talk, talk. There is no drama, tension, storyline, advancement or progression. Just one negotiation after another - and trying to make each one count. I don't mind this as a change, but it's also not something I want each gaming session either.

The mid-game provides some more interesting trades involving commodities, cards and special action chits. Thef aster it is, the better it is. Decisiveness, gentleman, that is the name of the game! Tempered by the fear of losing out on a possible win-win.

1st play Chris, Claudio, Monica,  Terry and me. Rough game.  I almost think it might be harder than Intrigue, just because it lasts longer. Won. Largely due to making an awesome privilege string.

2nd play, Chris, Claudio, Tripp, Matty and myself. I really underestimated the privileges (set-collection) and came in last. :(

3rd game- me, Claudio, Chris and Jamie. I won, again largely due to a set of 9 (out of 14?) privileges

From my experience, albeit only 3 games, I really think getting a good set of privileges is key here. Get them early and negotiate your ass off to get a string.
 
Not something I'd play everyday, but very very good.

This is a very clever game in which you're trying to negotiate with the current player to try to get some value out of his turn.  It feels a little like Modern Art in that you're trying to make as much money off your turns as possible.  Spatial games are always fun for me, too.  However, the free-for-all bargaining is a little too chaotic for me, especially since it's often not obvious what sort of deals are preferred.

I'm slowly reading the rules. What should I say about a game that I own since months and I couldn't play because I could only recently get translated rules, and dozens of pages of german rules are too much? TOO DIFFICULT! Why are games so difficult? It even has too many german-language pieces... Actually reading the rules the game seems nice, so I suspend my negative vote until when I'll play my first game in 2037, when I will find the time to teach it to someone. The real reason for which I bought this game is that... I'M FROM GENOA!!
==== Update ==== I took about 2 years to read the rules but finally I did it :-) and it is not difficult as it seems when trying to understand all those pages. It is quick enough, with a very complex strategy and it gives you the chance to decide your own way to victory or to be transported for a decent match without any decisive choice. Very good. It is probably one of the most interactive games ever, together with Siedler, although it increases only after some games, when negotiation becomes smart enough.
ONE NOTE: The spirit of the commercial town is well depicted, but Genoa doesn't have parks, and the historic center is famous not to have almost any square. There are lots of palaces, instead, a nice cathedral (but completely different from the one depicted): in Genoa marble and ardesia (a black stone) are used to build buildings and churchs with horizontal stripes. And there are no "streets", rather very dark and tight pathways to the sea! 8-)

I put this as almost perfect, we always seem to have some minor quirk where we miss something in the rules.  But this is just downright fun - I love the creative interactions and movement strategies caused by the negotiations and bluffing.  Also, the "I just can't make it where I truly want the tower to go to..." feeling puts some tenseness into the game.  The whole initial tower placement and the corresponding landing in the marketplace advancement of the round marker puts a really nicely executed random element into the game that adds to the fun.

Finally managed to get this to the table for a 3er game. We didn't really know the value of things, but more plays should solve that... Enjoyable game. 

This has the 'it's in German and it doesn't play with 2' problem. We've tried once with 2 (which doesn't really work for negotiating) and once with 4, but that time we didn't get past the explanation.

Great game with the right crowd. If you dont like negotiating, then dont play this game. I like Rudigers trademark design where you have a tower of discs that you place onto the board to trigger certain actions. You find it in Robber Knights, Goa and Louis XIV as well.

RATING: 7
Fun game.  It has a good amount of negotiation that we are just starting to get the feel for.  I rated it a 6 after one play, but now it's higher.  Our group tends to be pretty good with negotiation games, so it rarely takes more than 90 minutes.  Have also played it with a slower group, and it came in at 2.5 hours with instructions, which isn't too bad, but feels a bit long.

One of the best things about this game is that everybody's turn is everybody's turn.  The way that negotiation and action limits play together makes this one of the most interactive of the lighter Euro games.  I think I'd only want to play this with the full compliment of 5 players.  This is the gateway game for people who like Monopoly.

You want player interaction?  You got trading up the wazoo with this suprisingly complex euro.  I'm still getting my feet wet on this one, and I can't help but feel that some of the action cards are just far more useful than others.  Not a gateway game, and not for shrinking violets.  Without the right group, all the trading can get to be a chore.

My rating has no correlation with what I think about the design of the game, but with my willingness to play it.

I really like the disc tower mechanism, it's ingenious and drives the player interaction. 

The game adapts itself to different kind of groups i.e. it's a player-driven game, going from high levels of negotiation to a more analytical, more conservative trading system.

Sadly, I'm not interested in economic games (economic games being games where money is what drives the game and the main goal) nor in negotiation games, thus my relatively low rating.

It's a LOT of negotiation and you'll need good negotiation skills to win, but you'll need equally as good strategy/tactics to win as well.  Fans of "Chinatown" and "I'm the Boss" will enjoy this.  Playtime is easily 3 hours, but time flies.  I think you should only play this game with exactly 5-players.  Probably my all-time favorite deep strategy game as of April '05.

This game had a good unveiling this past summer at the cottage.  Unfortunatley, it hasn't been played again.  To be honest, it has been quite some time since I played to accurately recall what happened, although I can remember it being a fun, yet intelligent game of negotiation of board tactics.  It's been asked for since then, but due to socializing and so on it never made it to the table.  I'm glad to have it!

A very strong game of pick up and deliver.  Everything in the game is on the trade block in this game, something that can lead to some wild and crazy combinations.  Since the tower player can choose any offer they want, but only one action can be taken per player per turn, there's a lot of very tough decisions to be made.  Game seems to take just the right amount of time, with basically no downtime.

We had our first play of this last night.  WOW.  This is the perfect game for our gaming group.  I really wish we'd grabbed this one years ago.  I always knew we should get on well with a trading/negotiation game since our group used to love Bohnanza with some sessions often lasting 90-120 mins due to the amount of haggling going on.

The strange this is after one play, I don't really get the strategy of this game and I even wonder if you can actually have one long term.  But it doesn't impact the shear awesomeness of the bartering anything for anything that takes place.  

As the icing on the cake, with hidden scores we managed 570, 585, 585 and 590 as the final money totals - so close to each other!  How nuts is that?  Add to that the final negotiation of the game involved one guy trading away 155 ducks (thats what we call the currency) in return for 2 privilege cards which only gained the leader an extra 20 ducks as it turned out - but that won him the game by 5 ducks!

Can't wait to play it again!

Played this once and boy did we get a ton of rules wrong but we still had a blast. Lots of negotiation can get tiresome but the game is short enough this shouldn't be a problem. You need the right people to play this with. Extremely stingy or spendy players will likely ruin the game, but the game corrects this behaviour to some extent if at least one player chooses to play optimally. Can be hard for new players if they don't know the true value of actions but this should become apparent quickly if playing with experienced players.

Not quite sure we 'get it' yet. The current notion that you can only get to do what you want by buying the priveledge on someone elses turn seems a bit too far. There comes a point where one wants to participate in the bidding for the right to move on ones own turn (value of the move .vs. the value of the move to someone else). NO ONE EVER doesn't bid on a move to a building.

RATING: 4
UPDATE Sept. 2011: Dropped from a 6 to a 4. Essentially a worker placement game in which the active player (a) chooses which jobs/roles/actions are available and (b) chooses which players get which actions. Of course, (a) and (b) are all open to negotiation.

That itself is very clever. What really annoys be about this game is that the game could *break* if only some players start keeping track of how much money each player has throughout the game. If one or two players are doing that, then the others are bound to lose.

Perhaps this game could be radically improved if money is open knowledge. In that case, players will start making more inventive trades with goods and special power cards, both of which are more difficult to put a value on.

I prefer negotiation games (such as Diplomacy) where it is impossible to put a numerical value on a deal. (Too bad Diplomacy takes too long to play). Or at least games that have long term goals (rather than short-term goals in Genoa).

This game stays in my collection because my lawyer friends really enjoy it.

May 2007: Awesome negotigation game ... that I can only tolerate once a year. There is one huge problem with the game. If the game goes by quickly, then it sucks because players haven't been negotigating much and have probably relied on luck or poor bluffing skills to achieve their contracts.

However, once people figure out how negotiations really work, then the game really shines. However, then the game takes *forever*.

I actually prefer Chinatown or I'm the Boss over this one; Traders of Genoa has a lot of fiddly rules compared to these two.

A nicely designed game which unfortunately relies heavily on a skill that I simply do not possess at all: persuasiveness and salesmanship. I felt like a blind person trying to play darts, and my final score showed it. (I ended up with about $100 more than I started with, and other players mad at me despite making huge profits off me the whole game.) I cannot fault the game at all, though I have no desire to play it again. If I do, my rating might go up a little, but after reading reviews and other discussion here, I doubt it. I would LOVE this game if the player whose turn it was could take all the actions he could reach in 5 steps, and no one else could do anything on that turn - then it would be pure strategy, and no salesmanship.

Things turned nasty in the third game when I discovered this is another solo-itis game. You just don't seem to be able to gain sufficient knowledge into what other players are going to do, so you concentrate on your own strategy. This is fine, as it works more or less in PoF and Elfenland. The trouble is after an hour and a half I couldn't be bothered haggling to have the trading tower favourably placed. I never felt I'd worked hard to deliever the large/small orders either, it felt more like luck. 

The worst problem, however, is it is just too long. I've never had to negotiate so often in my life. I played again after eight years (!) and while the game is clean, well designed and a typically taut euro, the repetitive negotiating made me lose interest by round 4. This a once yearly game for sure.

RATING: 7
About half way through the game I decided that it was more beneficial for me to do less in Genoa than to do more.  I think that it's a bad sign in a game when I find it more useful to just sit there.  But for some reason, I didn't feel that way for most of the game of Genoa.  I think it was my enjoyment of the nervous tension of wondering what each player would do and wondering if maybe there would be a way for me to try to get in on some of the money trading fun.

I did enjoy the nervous tension as well as the ability to plan to attempt to get the most out each turn.  I found that the starting spots I rolled were mostly worthless, so I had a really good time attempting to sell my turns to other people and I think that selling as many of your turns as you can is really a winning strategy.  But I guess it's hard to determine a winning strategy after just one play.

A game which demands constant attention and creativity. To win, you need to make quick tactical decisions about what you want out of each move of the stack, and then need to make creative offers that will appropriately entice your opponents, but not give them undue reward.

This is a good game, but it takes too long for what it is.  There's too much open-ended negotiation and this game can get bogged down.  However, the game itself has a lot of promise.  I just feel that in the time it takes to play, you could play multiple equally good games.

A very clever game, good for wheelers and dealers, but not so good with me. This is a negotiation game. I don't much enjoy having to constantly argue with everyone at the table over whether I'm going to get any points, or even any chance to play. It also bothers me a little bit because although every player can take actions on other players' turns, so much of the action is at the whim of the active player that there is a lot of room for favoritism and leader bashing.

Traded away at GameStorm, March 2008.

You've gotta love to talk, and make an effort to keep the pace up, but then it is a great game.

Well-structured and reasonably straight-forward, it is one of the best negotiation games.

Played once at a Ducosim convention in Ameresfoort (May 2009). I'm not impressed with the first play. The game will most likely suffer from overanalysis.

RATING: 6
My first game was slightly marred by having a player at the table who thought other players should only make moves they agreed with. This game is a fairly standard delivery game in which players earn money for collecting and delivering goods around the table, the objective being to end with the most money. 
The twist is that during a players turn up to five actions can be taken but the player can only take one action themselves. They can offer the other actions to other players in order to gain extra money. The game is a little too complex around this central theme, which is a pity because the central idea works very well in other games like Santiago.

Talk about trading games, here everything is for trade on every turn (or so it seems).  This keeps other players involved. But there is always more to do than can be done, so timing of actions is key.  But the round advancement mechanism means that all games don't last the same number of rounds, so one is playing their luck.

But with so much going on, the game can drag.  Probably better to play with a louder boisterous group than a quiet, analystical group.  Keep the pace of the game going or it drags for all.

Great negotiation/trading game.  Less AP prone than some other economic games because actions are usually either very easy or pretty difficult to calculate exactly how much something is worth to you.  But negotiations can still really bog the game down if you're not involved in them.  My main complaint is that the game, instead of escalating with too many good options to choose from near the end like many point-salad Euros, instead you have diminishing options that will be profitable, with most options worthless to you.  I think the game would benefit from reduced number of rounds and removal of the random round movement when the tower goes to the center spot 1/9 chance; that would make it easier to calculate exactly how many rounds you have left and I think speed up the final turns.

--Jan2008-- Looked amazing after one play - but I really have no idea how to rate it as a game.  To make it more explicit, I think that my enjoyment of the game is predicated entirely on the other players:  a good group would provide a 9-experience, while a less ideal group could easily give me a 4.  Do I rate it a 6.5 for the mean of the two?  And given that it's more than three years since I last played, do I drop it another point for its inability to get reliably to the table?
--Jul2010-- Traded away.

RATING: 6
Decent game with real interaction between players.  Players who complain about getting screwed in games should steer clear.  In ToG, you only get screwed if you dont know how to haggle with a positive result in mind. This one is a bit too long for what it is.  With a lot of fiddly negotiations, you could be sitting there twiddling your thumbs.

Keep this away from players prone to Analysis Paralysis...  it's nearly insufferable.

Make sure that you read the rules concerning the 1:1 trades and set the board up as shown in the rules...  all cards, wares, 1:1 tiles, and owner markers are tradable with the 1:1.

The merchant-tower is a nice idea that contains a lot of bribery attempts. So there's enough player interaction for me, especially because it's an economic game and not a war game. Some people maybe could find the small goods tiles too fiddly. All in all it's a good game, scratching on the very good surface.

RATING: 9
After my first game,I thought that Traders was everything a game should be. After the second game, I still pretty much think that, but with a condition. This, more than any other game I have ever played, is a game whose enjoyment is affected by the group you play with. If everyone goes into the game in the mood to make quick deals and have a good time, it's fantastic. If the players want to labor over every decision, it's not so fun. I totally disagree with the comments that this is a "gamer" game. I think that taking it too seriously and coming from a "gamer" approach takes a lot away from it. Likewise, the length of the game (oft complained about) depends on the players, not the mechanics.

Rating is for the 2-4 player games -- haven't played with 5 yet. It's actually pretty good with two, which is unusual for a trade / negotiation game.

The cool thing about this game is how open it is. You are free to trade pretty much anything (not only spices and whatnot, but money, cards, and even fractions of things you are about to receive). On top of this, you can use certain cards to string together long profitable combos of cube shuffling. I kept looking in the rulebook thinking, "surely that's not allowed!", but it all is, and explicitly so in a brain-melting example of play.

The teeny little board means that I can play it on my coffee table without leaving my gargantuan couch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game has a rather clever mechanic which limits the number of moves you can make per turn, and randomizes where you start on a 8x8 grid.  Cards in your hand give you a goal which, upon completion, earn you money; at the end of the game the player with the most money wins.  Each turn each player has opportunity for one action, but usually you want more than one.  Actions include things such as picking up merchandise, gaining special abilities, and delivering merchandise.  Only one player gets to chose the which actions will be taken by moving a set of markers (the merchant) up to 5 spaces on the board; players may negotiate and offer deals to get the merchant to go to a spot on the board that has an action they want.  This can lead to a bidding war, and the player controlling the merchant can refuse all offers, however once an offer is accepted both parties are bound by it.

Having only one action available each turn (there is a special tile that will grant an extra action, but it takes an action to get this tile) causes players to carefully weigh what they want each turn, and how much they are willing to trade for it.  The game does not lag, even when not controlling the merchant, since each player who has not taken an action still has opportunity to negotiate for an action.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A great trading game, with very high and only positive interaction. This genre requires the values of traded goods to be difficult to calculate and different for other players to make for difficult decisions. To some extent it is true here: it certainly is not obvious how much you should be willing to pay for what you want in order to still make profit, but there were some attempts to solve it mathematically. If you are a math geek and must play optimally, the game will lose some appeal. For more casual gamers just going by their intuition (which is a valid approach) it's a great experience. If you liked the interaction in Settlers of Catan, get this by all means.

RATING: 6
This is a difficult game to rate.  It is probably the best pure negotiation game around, but it is very demanding.  At the end, the players finish exhausted, cause nothing moves in this game without hearing offers and negotiation.  Besides it is a must to keep track of the earnings of the rivals, and try at the same time to reach the best deals.  That turns the game in one not to play very often.  Maybe the game is too long and could be played with one round less.  For a more frequent dose of negotiation, better try [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/11]Bohnanza[/url][/i] instead.  Nevertheless, if you want to do business and mesure every move until madness, this is the pick to make.

I must say I feel there is a truly great game there. But unfortunately, that's typically the kind of games I don't like. It's all negociation. In addition to that, it's often really tricky to estimate correctly the value of the different actions and the different goods.
To sum up: a solid game that was not designed for me. Could be talked into playing it once in a while though.

This rating applies to the five-player game only.  And even then only with a group who are willing to enter into the whole spirit of a game in which everything is up for grabs.  Judging the difference between an offer of cash and contracts versus an offer of goods and deliveries versus bonus cards is what makes this so much fun.
For everyone else, maybe a 7.

The game of trading, bribing, and the lust for profit.  Benefits from an interesting tower mechanism where the path is solely decided by bribes players are willing to make. Both binding and non-binding agreements happen. There are many ways to make money with no clear method to victory. The game is helped by a well-crafted set with handsome wooden pieces. VERY little downtime is one of this game&#039;s strongest advantages.

I can see why this is a good game, but >180 minutes of game-time and tons of negotiation puts this dangerously near the same class as Munchkin. I do not enjoy not knowing where I stand in the game, and the nickel-and-dime trades, risk-adjusted values etc make it really, really hard to know how everybody is doing if you're inexperienced. Too long for what it is, and too much like work (I do not like negotiation games much).

The little objectives in the game are cool. I especially like delivering messages, since I like to nudge the caravan in the general direction I want and let others drive it there for me. But the game takes too long, and those cute little objectives start to feel like chores more than goals.

I did not find this game enjoyable at all.  I do not like the constant negotiaion with other players.  I do not like the complete lack of control over what is occuring.

That is pretty much the only thing you do for the seemlingly endless 2 hour play time.

Played twice (initial rating). Wow, this is a substantial game, I am very impressed. Basically this is a 3 hour bargaining on the market which will completely drain all the players.  First game to do that to me since Le Havre, but where Le Havre feels like 3 hour solitary mall shopping this is SO much more satisfying. Still it's a bit long for what it.. Also I admire the game for being a very open design -  the players will define the feeling of the game and you must adapt. Some strategies will not ork with another group of people. I prefer to play it in a cuthroat way. Not for introverts and not for people who get offended easily. This is all out bargaining, shut up or hold a grudge and you'll lose. Also not for new gamers (I might looking a for lighter and shorter negotiating game to fill that niche). I raised the rating half a point for being such an intriguing design - something to admire (maybe even more than play). An artwork of interpersonal protocols. 
 
Overpaid philosophia edition of the game. 60€ is just damn crazy for the huge empty box you get. Still the game being eye-candy made it easier to get to the table. Also the chits are for me improvement over cubes and the coins are also better than papermoney. 

edit: needs the right kind of people to work - the loud people.

All about freeform auctions and negotiations. Underneath are some action and delivery order fulfillment mechanics which work well.

Everything meshes nicely. But you sure have to like negotiating.

I play the game two rounds shorter than the rules indicate and its still too long.

[3 plays] 5 players and 4. This sat for a long while until we finally had the right group at the right time. I've owned it patiently for 3 years, nominated it before, but finally got it played. WOW, was it ever worth it. This is hands down the best negotiation game I have ever experienced. There are so many routes to victory, so many tactical options to consider, and just so much tension at times. Everything about this game is terrific, including the theme, artwork, and components.

I didn't think I had a guaranteed victory in the bag, but at the end, I was pretty confident that I would finish close to the top. So did most if not all of the other players. I did, in fact, finish basically tied for last. Everyone was surprised by the overall results. All 3 of the top players had pursued various strategies to victory. My mistakes had been ignorance of how much to pay in some negotiations and completely ignoring the value of privilege cards, which made them even more valuable for those collecting them.

Anyway, it was among the best 3 hours of gaming in which I've been involved in many years. I LOVED it! I will play this anytime and anywhere there are enthusiastic players who take the game seriously and take the tough negotiations with a pleasant attitude.

UPDATE: Loving it just as much after the 3rd play.

A dry game that's principally focused on negotiations. Yet the die rolls for tower placement add frustration when it bloody doesn't head the direction you want it to. The negotiations allow players to 'bluff' but isn't cutthroat enough.

Ultimately, it's about the money. BE careful how much you pay opponents as every dollar counts at end game. Can get boring towards the end as everyone starts to get scared of allowing other people to move the tower into buildings. Overly long.

I really like the design, I find the symmetry pleasing, everything is just as it should be.  I also am a big fan of negociation games.  However, I didn't like it as much as a 2 player game.  It lacks the dynamic of a larger game and the incentive to help the other player by agreeing to deals, though there, just isn't very compelling.  My other trouble with the game is not really knowing what things are worth so not sure how much I should be paying in order to be able to do them (or what I should get paid to allow it).  However if I can get 4 or 5 people sitting down to a game, I would be pleased to join in.  Like I said, I love negociating games.  Update: have now played it as a 4-er and this is a fine game and I must say even the 2-er games I have played have grown on me.

Trading, Economic. I enjoyed our first (4p) play of this game. I like how open the negotiations are. We did play with several rules wrong (some of them fairly significant) so I'm looking forward to trying this some more.

Update: played this with 5p at BGGcon 2007 (and with the right rules this time, too). A solid game, but it lasts just a little too long; easily solved, I suppose, by just starting the turn marker a space or two further along the track.

Finally traded away. Didn't really grab anyone in the group, despite being a pretty good game.

A játék tulajdonképpen akár 8-as is lehetne, de valahogy nekem ez már túl sok a licitálásából és az alkudozásból. A szerző másik játékához hasonlítva (Goa) gyengébbnek tartom. Ettől függetlenül egy nagyon jó játékról van szó. Jól kitalált licitrendszer, többféle út a győzelemhez és interaktivitás egyfolytában. Aki az ilyen elemeket kedveli, annak nagyon jó élményt fog adni ez a játék, én azonban maradok a Goánál.

Két és fél év és nagyon sok más játék után újrajátszva rontok egyet a pontján, mert a szerencse szerepe nagyobb, mint egy ilyen hosszú játéktól elfogadható a szememben. Nem az én típusom a játék, de aki az interakciót szereti annak biztosan be fog jönni.

This is the ultimate negotiation game. There is an extreme level of intensity to this as everything is negotiable.

That said, I really like it. My only significant complaint being that it might be a little long for what it offers.  Rating may go up with more plays. Update: Yes my rating for this has gone up.  This game is delicious.

Excellent auction game, and I think this will always be in my top 5.  It can move a little slowly, but there's always something to be doing, as you're bidding on something.  It can be incredibly frustrating because you can fail to get what you want, but the reward when you accomplish your objective is twice as sweet.  It seems that you're always working toward something , making it fun to develop your plan on what to do next.

UPDATE: This has become my 10, as it is truly my favorite game.  When I was a kid and thinking up games, this is the kind of game that I would like to have created.  It just captures my imagination.

RATING: 5
Clever mix of euro mechanics and negotiation. The underlying euro is a unique system that nicely facilitates discussion and involves everyone on every turn, so the negotiation is a natural fit. Genoa is a bit of a long game even with players who move things along, but it's not a bad long game, just a tad repetitive. Another negotiation game I like, Lords of Vegas, has some of the same issues, but it's more fun.

An immersive game of wheeling and dealing. Everything you own is potential trade bait, and this puts your negotiation skills to the test. Depending on your family, it can be an excellent family game.

One of the best games of negotiation: EVERYTHING is up for dealing. 

The board shows a town full of buildings, each allowing a different type of action. The choice of available actions each turn is very cleverly chosen: each turn, the player rolls dice to randomly place a column of 5 discs. Then, he moves the column space by space as far as he wishes, leaving 1 disc behind in each space. At each building space, the building action may be used by a single player who has not already taken an action this turn; it goes to whoever makes the best deal with the person taking his turn! Actions include a variety of things like production of goods, orders for goods, special action tokens, etc. Whoever has the most money at the end of the game wins!

RATING: 6.5
An interesting game, but one I wasn't blown away by after a couple of plays.  Still, I'd be willing to give it another go.

I tend to really, really enjoy games with arbitrary, player-determined values, which Genoa has.  I think my rating would likely only go up with repeated plays.

RATING: 5
There are several different strategies you can use and I'm not sure which is better after my first full play, which is a good sign.  You have to be economically efficient with your trades.  Would like to play again soon and test various ideas.  Games can take a bit long, but it's still fun.  Plenty of interaction too. Update:  after playing again, it just took too long and there was too much downtime.  Also, the negotiation aspect fell somewhat flat for me.  Not bad, just not a game I would request  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very good game but definitely one that falls in that stereotype of "too long for what it is".

The game is a trading and negotiation game where players collect different types of goods in order to fulfill orders and make money.  The action mechanism is pretty unique in that on a player's turn he makes up to 5 actions available but can only take one of them himself.  The rest are sold off to the highest bidder.  That gives this game a great deal of depth and interaction with lots of interesting choices to be made.

It's not terribly complicated and my first game of this took upwards of 3 hours which is too long for a game that's just about resource trading and order delivery.  That being said I don't think it needed to take that long.  It took over an hour longer than the listed time on BGG, which while not always accurate, seems much closer to what it should be.  We didn't even play with the maximum number of players.

I think to play this game you need a person to take charge and hurry the pace along or outright institute a timer for negotiations, which is where the lion's share of the time took.

I would definitely play this game again but I don't want it to take that long and I know the people I play with wouldn't.

Well-balanced game - fun to play, quite tense. Heavily dependent on the players involved since negotiating is central to the game. But for those who are not good in negotiation, you can always win by rent-seeking activites too e.g. own buildings, deliver messages. The first time I played, I won - and not by any grand strategy but doing simple things. I claimed ownership of 5 or 6 buildings early on inclduing the cathdral and post office. These gave me recurring income thru the game. I fullfilled only one large order and was steadily falling behind. However, in the last two rounds, I string together 5 privilege cards that gave me a bonus of 150 ducats. I delivered 2 messages and one small order - another 100 ducats. Ownership of 6 buildings - 60 ducats. final score 890 ducats. Of course theother players were new to the games too :)

RATING: 7
The newer, re-released version of the game is the one that I've played.  And I was quite impressed with it, even if I find myself waffling on the "fun factor".  In my gaming experience, this is truly a unique game (it is certainly unlike any game I've played before), which is centered around a "negotiation" mechanic.  This means that the game experience is going to depend heavily on the specific group with which you are playing - people who are very serious/easily offended aren't likely to do well with this one.  But for those of us who like to have fun with our games, it certainly creates some interesting and entertaining interaction between players.  I'm just not so sure about having the negotiation aspect as the central mechanic since I generally dislike negotiation in games, although there are a couple of exceptions ("Bootleggers"!).  Over-all, I enjoyed my first play and would play it again, but I'm not sure if it would have long-term replay potential for myself.  And a quick note on the physical components: the new edition looks very nice - the board is gorgeous, the money tokens are easy to handle, and the rest of the bits and cards are functional.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm used to games where the height of player-to-player interaction is an auction. Oh, we enjoy table talk, but the direct interactions required for the game itself are limited and narrow in scope.

Traders of Genoa is completely different. I don't know how to handle it; certainly I'm awful at it. The wheeling-and-dealing in the likes of Modern Art is fun, but in Traders it's at another level entirely. You [i]must[/i] trade. You must negotiate. Any time you want something, you can expect to have to bribe someone into letting you take it.

Oh, there's a hefty luck factor -- it's entirely possible to have a large order dropped right into your lap -- but I don't think it's ever likely to be a determining factor, and that's an important distinction. Nothing in Traders is useless because everything can be traded. You make your own opportunities.

Two hours of constant negotiation is somewhere close to my idea of hell, but it does make Traders one of the most engaging games I've ever played, and a far more intense experience than I expect from a euro.

You might hate it, but you've got to try it at least once.

RATING: 8
Played once.  Great components.  This is the kind of game that needs the right gamer group, and I'm not sure that group can include me.  I am constantly cajoling the other players to do what I want, and at some point everyone begins to hate me.  And then I take 2nd.  Every time.  Anyway, it feels like a more complex version of a trading game like Settlers than a bidding game, with a higher difficulty in figuring out what items are worth in trade.  My rating in this case is based purely on desire to play again.  Seems like a good game, but I can't say it is for me.  First play took too damn long.  Update: Played again, this time with 5 players.  Bidding was much faster, and we skipped several rounds by rolling.Our group had a lot of fun, and I really got to see this game shine.  I'm upgrading this game from a 6.5 to an 8, and I could see it going higher.

i actually liked most of the elements of this game.  the only reason i rate it so low is the bribery mechanic--having to bribe other players to do what you want them to.  this really didn't appeal to me personally and quashed my desire to play it again.  if there were some way to play it without the bribery, however, i'd probably rate it quite highly.

Above-average trading game with a graphical representation very fitting for the alea line.
The game play experience is very much dependent on your group of players. If you are a group of deal'n'wheel players, you may have a lot of fun and a good challenge. If your group rather consists of AP prone players, you are in for a boring stalemate.
Worst scenario:
The auctioning player moves as he wanted to in the first place anyway, since first of all he must fulfill his own goals, but before making his intentions clear he lures the other players into bidding for something he would have done anyway. 
Horrible experience.

RATING: 4
Where to begin... the theme is weird with this "falling tower" on the city, but I don't play games for theme -- I play them more for mechanisms.

This game fails there as well. Unless you play this game A LOT and know the value of everything, it is almost impossible to understand what to offer teammates for each thing. Since the game is almost entirely negotiation based, there is a huge kingmaker problem present. Not only that, but the dice roll for where you can start to choose your actions combined with what cards you draw during the game really make it a very random and chaotic mess.

Maybe if they removed the randomness from where the tower started (and changed the special card of "determine where you start" to compensate) and made some of the card less random it might be more strategic, but I find a lot of the areas really random. If you happen to get some good trades that are in the same area with messages, you just do insanely better than someone who had been planning from the start.

Overall, I don't see the need to play this game again. I got bored and lost focus about 1/4th the way through the game -- and it lasted nearly 3 hours. I'd much rather play something like Chinatown or even Settlers of Catan for negotiation. At least there I feel like I can control the randomness of the resources by using statistical probability. Here everything is just random.

Interesting trading. Needs 4 at least and probably runs too long.
Exactly what you'd expect from a comprehensive, anything is up for trade game. I really like the design and the theme works for the most part. Moving the 'tower' pieces doesn't make any sense but it's integral to the design of the game and I could overlook it. If I can get this played a few more times then I'll be ready to choose whether I want to keep this or go for the simplicity of Bohnanza. Both games run too long and this is more restrictive in player count but I really do like them both.

A little overlong and it has some odd restrictions on what you can and can't trade (mostly when you can't trade).

I like the way that, once you start building a route, people can renegotiate the terms of the next spot and hold the player to ransom.

It was compared to Chinatown and I think I prefer CT, but this does some decent things. There are a lot more 'moving parts' in Genoa, but I prefer the simpler, refined CT.

I usually like negotiation games, but this one drags a bit.  I was not to high upon the mechanics of this one, though it does have some merit.

I think this is eclipsed in my mind by some other, more pure negotiation games that can offer the same amount of fun in the timespan. (read "Princes of the Renaissance").

Or if you want the tactical feeling of the tower movement, Look at "Goa".  If you want the pure Negotiation Feeling, Look at "I'm the Boss". All of these seem to take the place of this game for me.  And there is no reason I would ever want to play this one again.

This is one of those games where I think using the BGG "recommended" ratings would be an injustice.  The Traders of Genoa is a fascinating game, where anything and everything has value, and even abstract things like "Start any space" pieces can be bought, sold, and traded for concrete things like metals or fabrics.  However, even one player that isn't "into" the game can destroy it for the other players, and this is a game where everyone must really want to get involved - wheedle, trade, and make a deal - for the game to be fun.

A bit complicated, at least after the first play. But I rather liked it. Needs more plays. Edit: after two more plays, love it. The only thing that bothers me, is the lack of control, especially in a five-player game. You got your action but it's not really sure if you get to use it and if you do it, is there point taking it. Does it give you anything you really need? 

I think there's some fun missing from the game.

What a great game this is! We just played our first game of it, with four players. Despite all the crazy wheeling and dealing that ensued, we all ended up within 25 points of each other at the end - with the leader only 5 points ahead!
Everything about this game strikes the right chord. There are some interesting mechanics in the moving of the tower, and the general mechanics of scoring are sufficiently varied to provide interest, but undoubtedly the star of the game is the trading. Being able to trade every in-game item between players raises the game from good to brilliant. The negotiation of deals between the players is so much fun. On top of all that, the theme works, the artwork is beautiful, and the components are high quality.
I'm happy to call this my new favourite game after only one play, and I can't wait to give it another go!

Edit: Okay, perhaps predictably, this didn't grab me anywhere near as much on our second game. I've lowered my score by nearly a whole point, and I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt by not taking it even lower. It didn't help that the tactics I decided to pursue this time around were the ones that were aggressively blocked by the other players, while the player who was blatantly obviously in the lead was left to his own devices, and hence won by a comfortable margin. The game thus devolves into merely trying to convince the other players that you're not winning; that seems a bit boring to me.

This looks like a sister game to Princes of Florence - the artwork and "theme" are very similar. In fact the two games would make a very nice thematic combo played one after the other. Mechanics-wise it's a combination of euro strategy with a free trading aspect (such as in Bohnanza). If you like both types of game - like I do - you should definitely try this. It's not a very short game, though.

This would rank even higher in my book were it playable in a little less time than it typically takes (which consistently seems to be more than the advertised two hours, at least in five-player games). The bickering this game brings out in people is wonderfully painful!

RATING: 5
Bleurgh! A decent game that's ruined by having a free trading element. The constant haggling and attempts at deal making completely ruin the flow of the game for me. That's a shame, because it has a lot of potential.

The shortness of Genoa is balanced against the trading aspect which is neatly done. A very nice game.

Genoa is the gold-standard for bidding games, as nearly every possible event in the game is up for sale.  The trick with this genre is to make the dealmaking emotionally engaging, and Genoa succeeds thanks to a mesh of complex rules.  It has exciting moments although the original Alea version is too long by a round.

RATING: 7.5
This is a great negotiation game. I've had a chance to play with 3 players, and it was brilliant. Constant deals were thrown about the table to influence the controlling player to move to certain locations. The meta-game found in Genoa is fascinating. My prediction is that the most charismatic negotiator will usually win, and that is an interesting social exercise. Some would argue that a social experiment does not make a boardgame, but I don't care. It is a game that does a good job at simulating traders cutting deals and negotiating with each other. I am a big fan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Its modern art for negotiations with more bells and whistles.  Paying other players a percentage of the different comoodities.  Good interactive game.  

Update: The length/payoff ratio for me is not there.  The rating has tailed off in time.  Games really drag, and the negotiations tend to be more like extortion or an auction. than wheeling and dealing.

I should probably visit this with different players, but negotiations to me in games like this seem like very very long auctions.  I like auctions, I do not like negotiation.

This is probably the best trading/negotiating game available.  It's certainly more complicated than either Settlers or Bohnanza, but the added layers of depth make this game less dependent on luck and based more on the skill of the players in getting the best deals.  The presentation of the game pieces/board is especially attractive.  However, the game does lag a bit towards the end and would be a little better if slightly shorter.

At heart this is a negotiation game.  Sure there are the different ways of scoring points: getting routes covered, taking single goods to shops, taking three goods to villas and gathering groups of 'privileges'... but if you can't convince people to help you out or if you consistently overpay for things you'll likely lose this game.  

This falls into the fairly large category of games that I love but am not good at.

Well, I got this before realizing it probably wasn't my thing. It's nearly unplayable solo; either that or my patience is shorter than it used to be. I've decided not to torture myself. I don't know if I will ever play a real game, with others, particularly since my version is in German.

As far as why I feel I can't play it: Trading possibilities are way too open and it's too hard to keep in mind all the agendas of the players.

I was quite sad to realize an earlier edition came with wooden cubes for the wares.

Very heavy on negotiation. However, after my first play in years, I found the value of everything to be far too opaque for me to negotiate over.

So, it would probably take quite a few plays before it would be enjoyable, and not clear it'll ever be worth it for me to put in that kind of effort up front. Would prefer the much more straightforward [GAMEID=115] when it comes to negotiation games.

Played this once with ex-boyfriend's family. There were four of us in the game, and it was fun. The ending was a bit of a surprise. Some tense moments at the beginning when one player was just being aggressive to the rest of us being nicer (or in my case, just trying to feel my way through the game for the first time.) I'd definitely like to play again, and other games based on negotiation and bidding in order to sharpen skills that I feel I'm lacking.

another game that I have only played once, but seems that it is just my type of auction game. Much more meat to it than modern art. Although it is unfair to compare them with each other.

If you like euros, if you at least like a little bit auctions and dont mind a 3 hour game, this is a great game.

I think I like negotiation games, even though I frequently feel like I am either being left out of a deal because I am trying to think about it, or jumping into a deal without considering the cost.  This certainly reminds me of I'm the Boss, but the structure is certainly very different.  There is more structure to this game, but the trading and negotiation is more open and varied.  It is a shame that the game takes so long because I think it would get played alot more if it was shorter.

Traders of Genoa is a perfect example of too much of a good thing.  The first half or two thirds of this game are intense fun, but it goes on for a bit too long.

With various paths to winning, nearly constant player interaction, and an ending that is not easy to predict, Traders of Genoa is a treasure. The complexity of the mechanics here yield so many possibilties that it could be overwhelming to casual gamers.  For me, it makes every return engagement, a joy. Also I feel this game is best played with three to four. The only gripe I have is the color scheme for the commodities. Are there no colorblind Germans?

pick up and deliver. long

roll dice to position merchant in specific location on map. then from there move with discs around ala istanbul.
inactive players can negotiate/pay/trade the active player to move to certain building so they get that action. active player might just ignore and do whatever they want
can buy buildings so that when merchant utilises your building you get some money

Sublimely unique.  I love the idea that EVERYTHING is tradable.  A Euro I can really get behind, with lots of heavy negotiation and bluffing, and very little dry cube crunching. In my opinion, the more players the better (despite increased playtime), because then actions start to go a lot closer to their REAL worth as there's more competition.  

It can run longer than expected, and it is really tough to figure out how much to pay in your first couple games.  Things tend to settle in at a fixed price as a game goes on, which means that getting bargains can be pretty tough.  Lots of room for sneakiness in other ways, such as getting your messages and small orders delivered.

A good negotiation game but you need the right group. And as far as negotiations go, I would much rather play Chinatown. Now if only Chinatown would be reprinted soon.

2008-04-10 - From 6.75 -> 8. I played the second time with 3 and boy was it ever delicious. This was a game that I thought about long after it was played. Very nice though a good set of players is highly recommended.

2009-04-18 - I played again with 5 and I am not sure. I think it is a great game but highly dependent on the group. Should I keep it or should I trade it away? Lately, I've been favouring the shorter, less intense games so this might be a game that goes....

2009-06-13 - I think it has to go... very dependent on the group dynamic and I've just been wanting to like this game. Actually, this game brings out a mean streak in me. That's not something I want to cultivate.

RATING: 7
This game is extremely group dependent- with people who don't like to haggle this will flop miserably, as you have to negotiate for even the right to take an action. Conversely, some of the best gaming experiences of my life have been playing this game with friends who weren't even gamers. Unlike most negotiation games I've played where it's easy to evaluate what an item is worth because the mechanics are so simple and/or there is only one currency that can be traded, here there are enough different currencies and enough hidden info that valuation is very difficult, which opens the door to some creative dealmaking. So to make a long story short- if you've got a group of people who enjoys negotiating this is a must-buy otherwise it's a definite pass
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It's a negotiation game, and when it comes down to it, I just don't like negotiation games.  They seem too free-form and unstructured for me to feel like I have a lot of control over them, and it's also very difficult for me to value what something is worth to me, much less what something will be worth to other players in the game.  This might be the finest negotiation game ever made (and judging by its ranking, it's at least among the top five), but it's a negotiation game, so I'm unlikely to want to play it very often.  Bleah.

Got a first play in tonight with 5 players.  Won by 5 ducats!  I liked the game although wading thru the rules was horrific.  They really need to have a 3 player walkthru or something to get you started playing.  Too many concepts to get your head around all at once and not very clear about your options. I went last (fifth player) and was the first to realize we had a Start Anywhere "card" so I started on the Cathedral, moved around the corner to the City Hall(?) and then placed my owner markers on both. I then used my building action card to get more owner cards and took the post office, too. This made me a marked man, but I managed to pull it out with some luck.

I love the negotiations, the complicated relationships between the various buildings/special actions, the aesthetics, etc. Needs finer ducat gradation, though, and there is a certain "blind" element that can be unsatisfying.

A solid game that involves resource trading. It's much more structured than the likes of Chinatown but that kind of holds it back. As a result this game doesn't get played all that much any more. Sold

I really like this game.  I've never had a bad experience with it, and I'm a big fan of trading games.  I also like that this box matched Puerto Rico and Princes of Florence and looks so nice on my shelf.  Top notch production and great game play.  I give this one seven thumbs up.

Only after one play. This was a very very enjoyable negotiation game with many paths to victory. My only quibble was the duration it took to play, although I may consider moving the turn marker down 2 spaces next game, or even just having a 1 minute timer to complete all your negotiations on your turn or lose 15 Ducats to the bank! (that should speed things along..hee)

Some negotiation (bartering, nagging, begging) games push the right buttons for me.  Traders of Genoa is not one of those games.

This one makes me want to completely stop talking just so the game will end more quickly.  Unless I activate my bionic mouth and bionic patience, 60 minutes is all that I can stand of constant wheedling.  ToG is longer than that by a factor of two.

RATING: 7.5
Rating after only one play, so tentative. I like the "anything up for a trade" concept. In practice we settled onto standard values that we used for most trades; perhaps with more games we'll become more flexible.

RATING: 9
A very different game. Everything is up for negotiation, which means it can take ages to play with people who can never reach an agreement. Full of options and the tower movement is brilliant. You have to spend money to make money and you win by having the most money at the end. That's something I usually dislike, but it works here.

First play and we got the rules wrong... Damn. I'm not confident that I will like to play this game again though. Chinatown is so much simpler and oozes negotiation. Genoa has all this weird and specific rules about purchasing buildings and when and how you should trade with other players... Idk, I need to play this again anyway.

Hubby wanted to know how I won my first two games as 2P. Told him he had a very good headstart so I worked doubly hard to bridge the gap by going for more Messages and Privilege cards. Letting go to good trade offers.

I wanted to like this one but didn't. It's all about haggling for tower placement to get cubes & special cards. The game was too long (we had 5 players) even though we quit a turn early and lost 2 rounds to starting position at the market.

wow, this turned out to be way more fun than I thought it would be, auctioning off actions and the back and fourth of moving around the board depending on who's in control and who has the money to spend is very cool indeed...

RATING: 6.5
Rather complicated and very difficult for novices to understand the relative values of the zillions of different actions and paths to victory. Felt that my decisions were forced or made for me by other players far too often, and I had very little control over my fate -- but this would probably be countered by a better understanding of the dynamics.

This is a fantastic trading game where everything is negotiable. This game stands above others for me because once you own something (other than buildings,) it's yours. No silly card or robber can take your stuff away.

This game seems to have good potential.  I haven't played it enough to get a really good handle on it, but it appears to have some depth.  The game also seems to take a lot of time both to explain and to play.  It's critical to try to keep up a speedy pace during play.

I don't think you can like trading/negotiation games and not like this.  Everything is up for barter... your goods, your cards, where to move your pieces... Add in hidden objectives in the cards to make money and you get a very fun uncertainty as to the value of your various trades.  Seems like it might run a bit long based on one play... if it tightens up a bit this rating will rise.

Update: When we want to just trade stuff we always reach for Chinatown or Bohnanza.  Genoa is just too much too explain and too long running for our tastes it seems.  Traded away.

RATING: 6
Undoubtedly one of the best negotiation games designed.  Unfortunately, it is just not the kind I enjoy.  Almost anything can be bartered and traded.  There are plenty of ways to achieve victory, and everything is equally useful if you can make the most of it (with the exception of the Palace/Building action special tile, which is dependent on you actually owning something on the board).  Full complement of players recommended, but be prepared for a long session.  I perfer open money as well, because it can give people a better idea as to who is currently in lead, but it is meaningless if no one take that into account when trading and is only interested in taking the highest offer.  Deeply involving and highly interactive, a must try for those into the social aspect of board gaming.

I have to replay it with other players. For now it seems potentially very good but I find difficult in trading actions. At the end each one wait for their own turn and the game result in less opportunities for each.

An oldie amongst the new style euro-games. It took a long time before we played this one. Mainly because we just never were able to lay our hands on a copy. Until a couple of months ago, when we received an e-mail with an offer to buy this game (brand new, sealed) for 50% off. We ordered it, and it ended on one of our shelves. Didn’t expect too much of this game, but decided to give it a try and discover that way, why it’s ranked so high in the BGG-charts. After playing it became clear. This is a very good traders game. It’s more complex than most of the traders-games I know, and that’s exactly the reason why this isn’t just another solid pick-up and deliver game. It’s not a game for families, as it can take over two hours to play a game and it might too complex for those who don’t play games on regular base. But if you do play games more often, then this is a gem to have in your collection.

Good game with potentially vicious trading.  Since you can trade anything physical in the game, it can get interesting, but usually the trading remains simple.  Also, the game does present a small suspense factor with the risk built into the market roll:  Unless the player chooses the start position rather than rolling, there is a 6.0125% chance that the turn track skips forward a turn..

Tentative first play rating. Elegant game of area control meets set collection. Love how thematic it is. We had a very tight 4-player game: 68/68/67/5x. Those scores makes me think the game is surprisingly well-balanced. Has one of my favorite characteristics of a game: elegance. No fussiness in the components, the rules, or any of it. It's beautiful, the rules are clear and easy to grasp, and the game plays well.

1 play / 2 players

LIKE: Clever mechanisms of combined card taking and majority scoring. Simple rules, quick play. I liked how the tickets can control the speed of the game and when scoring rounds take place.

DISLIKE: Randomness in how the cards come out. The board is a little visually busy.

OVERALL: I liked it and am pleased it played well with 2 players. A heavier version of this with cards and area control would be "Guilds of London".

RATING: 7.5
I enjoyed my first play with 2-players. It plays fast and smooth and is very smart. Our game ended with a tie breaker which was pretty shocking - a fine sign of a well balanced game. The placement creates a tense conflict - placing for cards, placing for majority, placing to advance the current round - all are in your in your mind. And what about considering what your opponent is wanting? It's 100% open information when you take your turn. It could create AP, but in fact it is too breezy for that to happen. And the production! Just amazing amount of beautiful detail - really too much perhaps (nearly every card is unique in details, but not in function). I like it quite a bit.

RATING: 7.9
Took a while to figure out what to do with all the cards from round to round, but once we got it down, we played it six or seven times over a long weekend and enjoyed it each time. It's fun for adults, but kids 8 and up can figure out the strategy pretty quickly, too.

Not really sure what to think.  I felt like I understood the mechanics and options, but I couldn't grasp the long-term strategies or why my opponents did better than me overall.

Was very easy to learn how to play, but not understanding what was going on detracted from my enjoyment, and makes me question that this might not be a good "area majority" game to have as a gateway game.

RATING: 8.5
Simple rules, yet tense and challenging game-play! The perfect gateway game and a sure-fire SdJ winner if not for its American design.

What I find really amazing is that I have no interest in any of the World's Fairs, and the theme is pasted on....but it's pasted on perfectly! The art is so beautiful and the flavour-text so interesting that a theme-fan like me doesn't care less if the theme has nothing to do with the mechanics: the theme still draws you in! Kudos to Mr. Kevern for crafting a game that, by rights, should be "just another soulless euro", but is strangely evocative thematically.

"Hhhhm, which slot should I pick? The one with one or two cards, or the one with four cards?" Then the next player does the same pondering, and the next, and the next. Surprisingly, in the end all picking up the slot with the most cards!

RATING: 7
Love the art and components. The fact that each card has a unique factoid on it is cool. And I do enjoy the theme, pasted on though it may be. 

So far it is not seeing much play because other games usually rise to the top list ahead of it. But despite that I am hanging on to it as potentially a good gateway game for muggles. Or as a filler for my regular game groups when we can fit it in. 

Was originally drawn to it because I love Gold West by the same designer.

RATING: 6
A well-designed game on the lighter side, with great art and info about the exhibits at the fair. It's always a tough decision when deciding where to place your cube, yet the game plays quickly and doesn't overstay its welcome. I like the Ferris wheel as the center of the fair and the game's timer. 

The only real downside is that analysis paralysis is likely at the end game, since everyone's potential score can be calculated before you take your turn. This could have been avoided if the chits that players collect for VP sets shared a common reverse side. Instead, they have the same image on both sides and can't be played face-down. Coins and awards could have been designed the same way, and cut the same size. This would have allowed players to choose to play with hidden or open running scores.

NEW REVIEW:  This is a very good game mechanically.  There are quite a few things going on, which can be very fun for some people to puzzle with, but can lead to AP for others.  My biggest issue with the game remains the same as in the past.  The theme just feels incredibly thin.  Nothing about this feels like building a fair or going to a fair in any way.  You could remove the theme from the game entirely and it wouldn't be any better or worse of a game.

OLD: This game seems mechanically sound, with a bit of depth.  My biggest issue is that, while the setting/theme seems like it COULD be interesting, the execution is not.  The game looks very bland and boring.  It doesn't feel like you are going out and finding exhibits for the worlds biggest fair, it feels like you are just setting down and picking up wooden blocks.

I purchased it at BN for 30% off plus a 15% coupon. A light Euro that is quick to play and family friendly. I think this qualifies as a gateway game and great introduction to area control with some set collection on the side. A very beautiful production that is just right. Not overproduced or lacking. Quick turns allow this game to be completed within 30 - 45 minutes.

A very approachable game for new and seasoned gamers alike.  It's all about area control and set collection.  For most of the game it feels the "right decision" is obvious and that the game runs on rails, but then you hit those critical moments where taking or not taking a certain action could be a critical game deciding factor.

Very fast, good gateway/family weight area control.  Theme is pasted on, and could be anything else; card text/art is nice but not really noticable as part of the game.

I will have to admit that the theme of this game goes a long way for me...I have always been fascinated with the 1893 World's Fair...the confluence of so many amazing things in one place at the right time and location.  The industrial revolution had met science in a collision that produced innovation unlike anything ever seen before.  Now, the game is not so innovative...it is a simple area control game...maybe the simplest area control game.  But the art and theme are there, the game play is fast and there are a few worthwhile decisions to be made.  A keeper...

RATING: 6.9
Not bad for a game with a pasted on theme and random card distribution. Not sure I'm crazy about the influence characters which kinda force you to go a certain direction or forfeit the cards special ability. Game feels just a little bit underdeveloped and may benefit from a future expansion. I like it enough to keep in my collection as a filler.

This game is really really really good. It has replaced San Marco as my favorite area control cube pusher. It's a nicer game, but decisions tend to be less about helping yourself and more about slowing everyone else. Lots of ways to score points so there's many paths to victory. Great art, good thematics for an abstract, and educational flavor text. I can't recommend this game enough.

This is an area control game that leaves you with a tough choice of place in an area that you need to control and take whatever card(s) are there or get the cards you want and place in an area that might not benefit you.

Glad to see that this one no longer seems to be flying under the radar. You get a family-friendly theme with family-friendly game play. The game combines area majority with set collection, and works well with two players. In fact, often in the 4-player game, only one or two areas will have at least three cards next to them, so  the cube placement decision becomes nearly a no-brainer and thus less interesting.

I'm not sure if this is a 5 or 6.  Probably somewhere in between.   I'm not big on area influence games, so this was never going to score that high.  Still it is a fast game and makes good filler so I decided to go with 6.  I like the cards that give you extra (but delayed action of putting a cube down).  You don't want all of them, but they worth a premium...because they help get you majorities.

Combines area majority with card drafting.   The area majority was a little too evenly paced for my tastes - ties happened all the time.   And there are three completely different categories of cards in the deck, making for some odd clumps in the draft - but I suppose that keeps it interesting.   The theme doesn't fit with the mechanisms at all, but at the same time the history and flavor were quite interesting, and presented well graphically.   I don't anticipate this will be a game with a long shelf life, but it seems to have good buzz at the moment (Jan 2017).

RATING: 7
In classic euro style the game has very simple mechanics that blend with some luck to create tension and forced choices between short- and long-term gains. Quick to teach, and play moves along briskly. Definitely worth playing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
With the set-collection and area-control mechanics blended so well, the game play is fast and the rules of the game so smooth, that this game practically plays itself.  Built-in double-check mechanics are a work of genius: Did you forget to advance the Ferris wheel after taking a ticket?   Easy, just count all the tickets currently out in front of every player.  Did you forget to put new cards down?  Easy, just see if there are any areas empty of cards.   The game play makes it impossible to forget or skip a step.  

However, for a game so light on rules, there is a surprising amount of depth to your decision making here.  During your turn, you essentially have only five choices (which helps eliminate any Analysis Paralysis problems), but need to put a lot of thought into which one to go for while keeping an eye on the Ferris wheel to estimate how soon a player may trigger another scoring round.  Do you take the cards you really need?  Or do you go for area control to make sure you can cash in your existing cards during the upcoming scoring round?   The ability of players to tactfully control how soon a scoring session will come (by taking more tickets) is fantastic.   Taking “Influential Figures” cards allow you to plan you moves in advance and put more area-control cubes out during your next round, but you need to keep an eye on that Ferris wheel since you may not get a chance to use them before any mid-game scoring session comes.  

There is enough strategy here to keep long-time gamers interested in the game, yet also a fair amount of luck (about on the same level as 7 Wonders) to keep newbies in the game until the end, and therefore it’s a fantastic compromise game.  In every game we’ve played (always 4 players) scores are generally pretty close which is a sign of a well-balanced game.  

It plays in about the same amount of time as Splendor, but has a bit more meat to it.  

As for as production value, the educational flavor text also really pushes this game well over the top.

Wonderfully thematic cards with interesting tidbits from the World's Fair.  Area control that scales well and is simple and fun.  Very simple ruleset yet there is enough strategy and tactics.  Fun decisions and plays in filler time.  Great production.

The game is far too passive. You choose a place, then you hope to have a good set of cards to choose next turn. While there is competition over each area, you can't compete for everyone and it's usually bad to pick an area that only has 1 card so there's very few viable choices each turn. This means that the competition isn't particularly fierce and you don't care too much if you lose your majority. The game is also very tactical as the board will change after each round, so the game takes too long for what it is because it's impossible to pre-plan.

The tickets are also slightly underpowered, 1 point per card is fine, but 2 points for majority is too little to matter. This means that the game moves slower than what is probably intended since they also act as a timer.

I don´t see why this game is rated so high here on BGG. It´s a simple, dry and non-engaging game: You place your meeple in one of the five sections to get the majotity in this section and to get the adjacent cards. Three times in a game you change your cards into markers to get sets with different colored markers. That´s all.

A board game set in my neighborhood! Maybe I'm biased, but I really like this game. Plays very well at 2p. Set collection and leaving some supporters in place between rounds ensures competition for each area across the game. While choosing the area with the most cards available is the easy choice at times, especially as end of round approaches there's often a tricky choice between placing in order to get your exhibits approved vs taking a better selection of cards—made trickier by not knowing exactly how many turns you'll get before the round ends. (Two areas only take three cards instead of four despite having the save number of exhibit cards in the deck, making it more likely that you'll need to give up on getting some cards in order to secure placements in them.) Similarly, rushing the round end by taking Midway Tickets is often advantageous, but needs to be weighed against taking cards elsewhere that you may need to best take advantage of your prior placements.

Luck is obviously present in how the cards come out. Sometimes you may have a majority in an area but are unable to get many (or any) exhibit cards of that type by the end of the round. This is mitigated by leaving some supporters in each area between rounds, so your placements are not completely wasted. It adds a push-your-luck element to the gameplay that can be exciting (or frustrating).

There's some take-that interaction in the 2p game, denying your opponent the majority they need to get their exhibits approved, but it doesn't detract from my enjoyment of the game.

The flavor text on the exhibit and Midway Tickets is irrelevant to gameplay, but is quite a lot of fun to read during your first few plays or when playing with new players. My 7 y.o. likes reading the cards of the exhibits she gets approved.

Gameplay is very smooth overall. Would benefit from some kind of organizer for the various exhibit tokens, medals, and coins to make end of round scoring and exhibit approval less fiddly.

Component quality is good, artwork is BEAUTIFUL, and rules are well written.

Great family game, but just not enough meat on the bone for me to rate it any higher than I do. The card draws are pretty random and usually there is a clear cut area you want to play for. The interesting mechanic here is that you have to have area control AND cards in hand that match that area that you can trade in. That's fun. But the decision-making space here is limited. Great theme, artwork and good for families. Has it's time and place, but will only come out in those specific situations.

Point hoarding. The game feels hollow and does not make me want to play again.
There are hundreds of such games out there (simple, light, point hoarding with cards), is it necessary to have another one?

I think the World's Fair theme is a good idea, no matter which year you use, but you need a game system that works with the theme. I think this game system has nothing to do with the world fair and the theme is just there to sell the simple already seen mechanics.

Overall, I do not think this is a really good game. It is simple and quick, but if I want a simple and quick point hoarding game, I'd rather play Ticket to Ride, it is much more fun.

You really, really need to try this game out before buying it otherwise you will get caught with that one. I doubt you could sell it used...

Nothing really new and a really boring pasted-on theme. But it is a solid design with simple rules, short playing time and familiar mechanics of area control and set collection. The random tile setup is completely unnecessary and does not add any replayability, since all areas are basically the same.

I probably like this game more than I should. I like the round timer mechanic combined with area control and card abilities. It moves along very briskly without seeming that your choices don't matter or that it doesn't reward planning at least a couple of moves in advance. Very good time:depth ratio on this one.

This is not a heavy game, and that's OK. It's the perfect gateway game and a great game to play with kids. 

Thematically, it's solid. Love the aspect of collecting exhibits and supporting them. 

You're constantly balancing where to place your supporters versus what cards you want to grab to give you that edge. The game plays very differently whether you're playing 2, 3, or 4 players. You decisions are very tactical, though. In a 4 person game, you can't decide two turns ahead of time what you're going to do, as your'e always reacting to decisions from the previous two players. Maybe the cards you wanted were taken.

At this point, I don't know if you can settle on a strategy that will guarantee a win a majority of the time due to the randomness of hards hitting the table between the areas of the fair. That is a good thing, you might just get walloped on by your kids.

Dull as dishwater. It's kinda got area control and set collection (both of which I think are boring mechanics)... We also didn't have it explained to us about how you swap up for the tiles at the end of the round so that made for a crap experience.

Get lots of cards with actions on them, dominate the round in terms of cubes in 2 areas per round, that way you'll collect 2-3 sets and win 2 areas outright per round.

A gateway area control game that is a bit swingy due to the investigator cards. I think this has more depth than games like Ticket To Ride and Catan albeit a bit less fun. Got it because it is said to work with 2 players, but I think it's going to be a lot better with 3 or 4 because of the importance of second place majorities. In the end a fine gateway

Started kind of positively, but it very quickly became apparent that there is almost no decision making to be made here. The game plays itself since the only sane action is to take the biggest pile of cards each time, this then creates another pile of cards for the next player, and so on.

Light game that isn't terrible.  The best thing the game has going for it is the weighing it forces you to make as far as deciding if adding a cube to a particular location is more important to you this turn than getting cards you want.  All the while knowing that, if you are battling for a location, taking the cards there makes it less likely someone else will go there and leaving cards there will make it more likely someone else will.  The second best thing is that it does not overstay its welcome.  However, it didn't grab me or my family.  They all said the same thing - "We have better games and I can't see picking it."  Other negatives are that the cards can really swing a game and there can be a bit of king making.

World's Fair 1893 is a majority game, which also features card-drafting and set-building. It has two main things going for it: one, the main action of the game combines typical majority game cube-placement with card-drafting. When you place a cube in one of five areas as your basic action in a turn, you collect all of the cards accumulated in the area where you place. I haven't seen this done in this way before and it has the effect of softening the hard, dry edges of the majority mechanic, making it suitable for the kids to enjoy, because they are sure to get something every time they place a cube. There are three kinds of cards: action cards that must be used on your next turn (typical cube placement and movement stuff), midway tickets that give a point and move the game timer along, and exhibits in one of the five colors that you collect and can trade for scoring tiles if you have the most or second-most cubes in an area of a matching color. 

The second thing going for the game is all of the fascinating Chicago World's Fair lore that the game does an excellent job of presenting. However, none of it is related to the game play and you can play the game perfectly well never reading a word of text at all.

Other than these aspects, the game feels unoriginal to the point of fatigue. The scoring is very standard: points for majorities and sets of different colored tiles in the standard progression (1-3-6-10-15). Placing a cube as your main action. Moving the game timer by drafting cards. It's all too familiar for experienced gamers, but with luck this game will get outside of these circles so that those not-yet-introduced to our hobby can start to experience the flavor of strategic games in the context of this very approachable title.

RATING: 5
In World's Fair 1893, players vie for majorities in five areas of the exhibition. Each turn, a player puts influence in one of these five areas and takes their cards featuring attractions, persons with special effect or VPs. The game is played over three rounds. After each round, first and second place in each area gain VPs and can exchange collected attractions into tickets for a major game end scoring. 

World's Fair 1893 looks appealing. The rules are easy and it is played quickly. Unfortunately, it's surprisingly bland. Each area is similar, the flavor of the cards and the board is quickly lost. The experience won't change between plays. There's nothing to explore here.

Love this area control, set collection game with a historical theme.  There's so much interesting flavor text on the cards about the exhibits from the fair.  The only thing I'd change is that it would have been cool for the cubes to be replaced with some kind of token representing something from the fair.  Monopoly has the shoe, the thimble, the car, the dog, etc...I'd like to see something similar here rather than the cubes.  

Easy to learn, lots of fun, love it.

Worlds Fair is a wonderfully straightforward game of showmanship. Build your Exhibits, gain some influence, and gather supporters. You'll play through three rounds after which the player with the biggest reputation will come out as best in show.

An interesting card drafting game where you are trying to create sets of different colors and win area majorities in various types of technology at the words fair.  On your turn you place one of your cubes and select the cards in that area.  One card is place in that area and the next two areas that are not full.  As areas fill up they become more likely to be selected.  there are tickets that act as a timer for the game and end the round.  At the end of the round 1st and 2nd place are awarded points for each tech and you can turn in different types of "stock" for markers.  Markers are turned for sets at the end of the game where you are trying to get one of each color to make a set of 5.  Partial sets score increasingly more points.  

Light and quick.  You can easily play and teach in less than an hour.  I liked the game, but it was not very thematic and is not game I will run out and buy.

(11/17) 7. I'd always sort of thought/heard this was a pretty straightforward vanilla game but now that I've finally played it I can see it's much more than that.  It's maybe a family weight plus style game with interesting choices to make as it blends area majority/control with set collection.  Would really like to play again to see if certain strategies I came up with midway through would actually end up working out.

Kickstarter is a wild throw of the dice at the best of times when buying games.  But for every pile of late arriving, poorly conceived and expensive dross (Moongha...), there is a little gem.  And this is one of them.  A lightweight area control/set acquisition/worker placement game that is so well put together it plays smooth as silk from the first time on the table, is beautifully designed down to the last detail (if you ignore the obligatory cubes) and just...works.  Sure the theme is pasted on.  But it's pasted on well.  And the mechanics all function very nicely indeed.  A definite triumph for its designer.

Nice combination of set collection and area control that creates a tension between those elements - you need to control an area to collect the sets you need, and often your move has to choose between those goals. Still, nothing extraordinary.

I like Finca better for a similar feeling set collecting, movement, screwage game. But, this plays in about 15 minutes with 4 players and once you wrap your head around the couple of different mechanics, quite fun. You can get points a number of ways and also determine when rounds end: disrupting your opponents (which is very fun).

The game is very simple and very fast... the rules are also easy to teach and to understand.

Despite being a very abstracted game I have to say that the them is pretty unique and interesting, the World's Fair... and all cards for each type of Exhibit are unique with fantastic art and informative factual text... it's very very cool indeed. The production quality is also very good, good cardboard and cards.

The game itself, like I said, is very cool, it's almost a filler game, we played our first game in 39 minutes... and for that type of time frame it's an excellent game :)

Completely derivative design. The most standout mechanism here is how you are simultaneously placing area influence and drafting cards, but apart from that, the scoring isn't interesting at all. Renegade Games just aren't for me, I think, and World's Fair is the straw that broke the camel's back when it comes to this company. Nice presentations hiding a mediocre design will only get you so far.

Based on the World's Fair held in Chicago, players are trying to win support for their exhibits. Each turn, a player puts down a supporter cube in one of five areas, and collects the cards that are there.  The cards represent colors in the five areas, midway tickets or personalities which let you add supporter cube sor manipulate those on the board. 

There are three scoring rounds. The scoring round is triggered when a number of midway tickets have been collected by the players.  Depending on your placement in the area control, you can convert your color cards to approved exhibits which score points at game end (15 pts for 5 different colored cards). 

It's a fun game to play, and rating likely to rise with more plays. There are meaningful decisions to be made, and you can't blindly go for the area that has the most cards, and you have to think about how you want to convert your cards during a scoring round, since you have to struggle to win your fair share of majorities.

Quick and interesting area control game with scoring that forces diversification. The card mechanics are very clever as well...

Really good with 2 or 3, especially for the duration.

Graficamente carino sembra un gioco interessante. In realtà ho trovato le partite molto aride e ripetitive. Il gioco si gioca abbastanza da solo, poche scelte e spesso si è in balia del caso con la pesca delle carte. Giochino veloce senza troppe pretese che si può anche apparecchiare con soddisfazione ma mi aspettavo molto di più, almeno dal punto di vista delle scelte. Si spiega in pochi minuti e si è subito padroni del gioco.

Yeah, Alex J. Kevern, GO! This is a sweet little super-filler that lasts exactly as long as you wish it would. Great area-control game with a super-fine set-collecting scoring mechanism.

The artwork is nice, the flavor text is historical, and the "soft" end-of-round trigger is a nice touch, leaving players wondering exactly when they will score their shit.

[b]World's Fair 1893[/b] was sold via auction 10/15/16.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I was really excited to get World's Fair since it combined two of my favorite game mechanisms, area control and set collection. Add to this that it is an easy to teach, quick, light game and I thought I'd have a winner on my hands. The theme is great, artwork is very good and each card has a bit of history on it which lead me to zone out several times during my plays as I was reading the flavor text on the cards. 

I'm not going to break down the rules, as I said the game is extremely easy to play which in and of itself is not a problem for me. These types of games get a lot of play in my house since they are so quick to play. My potential issue is how much choice you actually have in the game. It almost always makes sense to choose cards form the area that has the most people cards since they grant you extra actions on your next turn and if someone manages to get more of those cards than anyone else it can really swing the game in their favor. 

I know they tried to balance this with the area control aspect of the game which makes it important to place your cubes in specific areas to try and gain control. Yet the people cards you can get allow you to manipulate the cubes on the board or allow you to place extra cubes so it's almost like the problem was exacerbated. I can't help but feel that this game would have benefited from further play testing and some possible tweaks to the rules. 

There is a solid game there and one I enjoyed playing, but I'm left with the feeling that the game played me since my choices almost always seemed obvious. Since it plays so quick it'll definitely keep hitting the table and maybe the game will open up more and I'll discover that I was wrong with my initial impressions. World's Fair is still a game I'd recommend trying if you get the chance.[/i]

RATING: 7
Initial rating, based on first play, with 4 people. My rating is based on liking the game very much for first play, but wondering for how long it would remain interesting, plus to what extend luck factors in the likelihood of winning. To that extent, I'd be interested in playing it more to get a better gauge of its depth and possibilities in play. 

With those caveats out on the table, this is a very clever design, easy to learn and doesn't take too long to play. Beautiful production goes a long way toward evoking the theme, although game play--worker placement, etc.--is more abstract. But I like the conception of interplay between placing cubes, picking up cards and the relative depth the designer achieves in thereby creating strategic choices.  Also how certain cards move along the time factor for each of three rounds in which they game plays out. And, the game is not so difficult that players can't socialize during play, yet it would take repeated plays to become adept at scoring and winning. There is a minor amount of screwage, as some cards allow players to move other players' cubes from one part of the board to another. Gorgeous artwork throughout in addition to the excellent design makes this game very attractive indeed. What seems like a significant luck factor might put off some gamers.

It's light (and probably too light for its price point). There'll be a couple of areas you want to invest in to win the area majority award plus score the cards you've accumulated in that colour, and the essence of the game is the decision on what to do if the areas where you want to go to don't have the cards you desire, but areas you don't really want to go to have the cards you need. Which is ok, but it feels like your result is mostly at the mercy of the cards that are available and what other players leave you. And hope to get luckier than the other players and have more turns where the cards in the area you want to go also match that area's colour, making it more efficient for scoring. There's also a bit too much downtime for a game this light as you can't analyse your play until the previous player's done (and new cards are revealed). Making it overall an ok experience and pleasant enough to play, but not world-beating.

Delightful. Has a Zooloretto/Coloretto feel to it, but I like this a lot better. The mechanisms are area-majority to accomplish set-collections; I don't normally enjoy area-majority, but I really like it in this game. I love how everything is open information. Good art and graphic choices. The theme is pasted on, but IT'S A FANTASTIC THEME!!

World's Fair 1893 is one of those games that's played on a giant rondel.  Each turn, a player places his influence cube in one of the five areas of the board, both to try to win a majority in that area as well as claim the cards that are there.  The cards are then refilled clockwise around the board.  There are three types of cards that can be won--"influential figures" that allow you to place more or move cubes next round, midway tickets that are worth points, and colored exhibits that correspond with the board areas.  Players that have the most or second-most cubes in a region at the end of each round can turn in the colored exhibit cards for chits of the appropriate colors, and at the end of the game players score for having diversely colored chits.  I did like how everything in the game seemed very well integrated.  However, I found it a little difficult to exert much control over what happened, especially as it was a little difficult to predict when the rounds would end.  On the whole, I thought this was a decent light game, but nothing special.

Fun and fast area control game.  I liked the mechanisms of adding cards and acquiring them for Worlds Fair tickets, tokens, and special abilities.  The round marker with the Ferris wheel was novel and the points awarded was competitive and balanced.  I liked how each round removed supporters for balancing and not running away issues.

The game seemed to generally have obvious moves each turn, reducing the unpredictability.

Quick but thoughtful.  Simple moves yet good amounts of consequences.   This game really does it for me.  It's a light-medium eurogame that just is fun to play.  It doesn't really feel like there's much downtime because you're interested what's happening during other players turns, or you can just read your really, really interesting cards.  Don't know what the teleautograph is?  Or want to know how much it would have cost to go to the world's first movie theater?  Take a look at your cards while other people are making their choices.  Brilliant game design!

RATING: 4
Played this game 4 player, and was very disappointed. This is a game that on paper I should have loved. A quick playing majorities game with set collection.  The flaw in the game is it's too chaotic. To collect sets, you need to get cards of all the different colors.  You gain cards by adding a cube to a region and collecting whatever randomly got drawn into that area. To then get those sets to score, you have to majority win or tie in regions matching those colors.  Since these are tied closely, you wind up needing to get cards by placing into regions that you can't hope to win a majority in.  That, or you can take nearly no cards and place a cube into a region you need, but then you aren't working on your sets, and since you can't control when the areas will score, you are just setting yourself up for worse failure.  

The regions also get moneyed up with new cards after someone takes from a region clearing it out. This means which regions are the most lucrative to place into is largely decided by turn order rather than any sort of strategy. The game does come with one use special ability cards, which spice things up a little, but overall just feel like they add to the chaos of the game. Particularly because they have to be spent the turn after you claim them. In majorities games I enjoy, there should be some ability to have a plan and carry out that plan. Some aspect of stability or predictability, and it's just missing here. At least it is with 4 players. Perhaps with fewer this becomes a better game, but then at the same time there's nothing unique this game really brings to the table that inspires a desire for repeat plays.

This is a light area control card game.  It's fairly short and is quite fun.  After playing this at a convention, my wife and I decided it's one we are going to eventually add to our collection.

I love the decisions you make during this game.  First, you need to decide which events you are going to collect.  Then you need to decide which areas to control so you can make use of those events.

It's fast, fun and easy to teach and learn.  I can pull this out with any audience.  So, so fun.

Aggressively mediocre.  A game can have simple rules with interesting tense choices--this game lacks the latter.  You have available 5 choices each turn, one or more options may be depleted so effectively even fewer choices may be available.  If you need a particular color card, it may not be there.  Or need to get more cubes on the board, they may not be able to be placed where you need them.

Surprisingly more fun than I expected. It is on the lighter side but blends different little competitive elements together rather smoothly, it moves along at a pleasant place and is a joy to look at on the table. Perfect game to play after hard day's work. Immediately nagged my FLGS for a copy.

This game does fit a very good niche for a 35-45 minute game.  It feels like it has more strategy and weight than a filler or gateway game, yet it plays quick and has easy to grasp rules.   I could see this becoming a game night stable for a lot of groups.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed playing this.  It has area control, which I usually don't care for, and a nice set collection mechanic.  I really enjoyed the unique card art and it's really a very pretty game, always a shoe-in to get my interest.  The gameplay is pretty straightforward and it's a solid game that plays quick and is easy to teach.

Played once with 4P. World's Fair 1893 is a pleasant and simple game with a classic flair to it, without being too dry and unexciting. Players take turns placing a supporter in one area of the fair and scooping up all cards in that area. The majorities in each area are scored at the end of each round, and the winners are able to swap cards for tokens. In turn, these tokens are used in a set collection scoring system at the game end.

While I'm quite picky when it concerns barebones area majority games, World's Fair 1893 succeeds in creating a competitive atmosphere without being too mean-spirited. The decisions are usually not too obvious, as players will want not only to win majorities but also have cards to cash in to make victories worthwhile. 

However, there are two minor drawbacks. The first is that the design feels very [i]safe[/i] and lacks a sort of twist to make it more distinctive. The second is that the text on the cards, while informative, makes the design look busy and conveys the feeling that the game is more complex than what it is.

This really ticks all the right boxes for me. Easy rules, wifey friendly theme, plays in less than 45 mins, quick set up, and plays well with just 2.

It's a fairly simple area control mixed with set collection, with supporter cards you can collect to assist with placing/moving your cubes on each area. With points awarded for collecting admission tickets, having the majority in each area, and getting exhibits approved in the areas you have majorities in.

A pretty simple, basic area control and set collection game. I love the art and theme, and the game is nicely presented, which gives it a tiny bump up. The gameplay is decent, but nothing that to me really stands out here. While it would make it longer or more complex, it would be nice to be able to hold onto the notable people cards for longer. Otherwise, your choices are fairly straightforward, as you usually try to go for a location that has a bunch of cards.

Great gateway family game that's a slight step up in complexity than a simple gateway game like Ticket to Ride.

I'm not into a lot of area control games, but this has scoring besides just the area control, and it just doesn't feel as confrontational.  The balance needed to score in all areas is something I'm not as good at, which makes for a refreshing challenge.

Little too abstract and uncontrollable for my tastes. It has some neat mechanisms, but it being the same thing over and over gets a bit tiring. Plus there's no real "pizzazz" to the game that makes it stand out. It isn't bad for how short it is, but it isn't really what I look for in a game either.

tl;dr: surprisingly good

This game looks pretty basic, and sounds very middle of the road, but I was very pleasantly surprised. Managing your cards well, going for the right majorities, using the special actions of the certain cards... It all falls into place very nicely and offers a surprisingly deep game. Now, this is no Terraforming Mars of course, but it is a good deal deeper than I expected.
It plays fast, it has simple rules and has depth. For me, this hits the sweet spot for these kinds of super fillers

I've played it once. (And won the game).

The interlocking objectives (scientists for extra plays, to then be able to play the exhibits) were interesting.  And the theme is certainly unique.

Unfortunately, the game play is pretty dry.  I could be convinced to play it again, but it I wouldn't jump at the chance.

Three artists worked to illustrate World's Fair 1893 and the attention to visual detail, as well as the exquisite flavor text, makes this a thematic treat.  It's a multi-layered set collection affair with players exerting some influence, but never making any difficult decisions.  Much time is spent adjusting cubes, checking scores, and exchanging cards for coins, medals, and exhibition tokens.  World's Fair 1893 feels more like a game about making change than anything else.

Seems solid so far.

The game lives up to what it is trying to do: a dead-simple game system that offers just enough depth and a playtime of around 45 minutes at the full player count.

Will rate after more plays but initial thoughts are positive.

Update: Unfortunately the luck of the cards is pretty big and the game can be prone to a runaway leader if someone gets lucky. Some cards are flat out better than others and some cards are useless if you're not able to turn them in for points by the end of the game. Sometimes you've got nothing but crappy choices on your turn, then when you refill the cards the perfect set of cards comes out for your opponent. I like the idea here (a fast-playing lightweight area control game), I would just like to see it implemented a little differently to help mitigate bad luck.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
It's area control, so it naturally doesn't work with two players. Best with four, but plays fine with three.

Sold.

This game is a wonderful game for new enthusiasts and experienced gamers alike. The depth of play that you get from this game is incredible for such an easy game to comprehend and pick up. This one will be right up there with Ticket to Ride as one of my go to suggestions for a wonderful "gateway" experience. If you have been gaming for years this game will also reel you in and provide a wonderful experience. I would absolutely recommend buying this game and playing it as much as possible! It's historical, thematic and a ton of fun.

I'd never heard of this game before, but was willing to give it a go. The main board is shaped like a Ferris wheel. Cards are laid out next to each section of the wheel, although some spaces can hold fewer cards. Cards are either 1) tickets, 2) colored cards relating to the different wheel sections or 3) special action cards (which mostly put cubes in different areas).

On your turn, you choose a section and take all the cards there. You also put a cube in that section. If there are any extra action cards, you'll have to use them on your next turn. If you took tickets you advance the timer around the Ferris wheel (when it returns to the base you'll score the round). New cards come out for the next X number of sections if they can hold them.

Each round you get points for tickets with a bonus going to who has the most. Players get first and second place points for each section according to the cube majorities. Then the winners can spend cards of that section's color (more if you're first, fewer if you're second, none if you're anything else) to take tiles of the same color. At the end of the game you score points for sets of different colored tiles, with big payoffs for more diversity (multiple sets can be scored).

It's a bit of a light game but it was interesting. The way that the cards comes out means that some sections won't be interesting as they'll have fewer cards. And special action cards are almost always good. And you want to fight for your majorities especially when you're trying to get tiles of a particular color for your sets. Despite there being possibly several conflicting goals there, I never felt like the choice of where to go was particularly hard to decide. (But I also didn't win.)

I'd like to try this again before passing a final verdict, but right now my opinion is that it's a fine, solid game but not one I'm terribly excited to play.

A very well implemented theme and fairly clear rule set helps this game along.  It takes one round to figure out how the game flows and once you get it, it proceeds very smoothly.  It played well with 3 people, I think it would the same with 4.  A player needs to be aware of the scarcity or plentitude of certain cards as the game progresses as this will affect their ability to complete goals or maintain area majority for scoring.  The ebb and flow of the available cards will help with replayability, I think, as there is no other randomization factor.  A lightweight area control/hand management style game.

One of the most elegant and beautiful games I've ever played. The World's Fair of 1893 is such a fantastic theme and the extra effort put into making sure that the history was honored in this game is impressive. There are so many different pieces of art work and so much incredible flavor text. All of this in addition to a very well thought out and smooth game. I can't say enough good things about The World's Fair.

I have been drawn to this game for a bit now, for both the amazing artwork and historical flavor. Fortunately, it has both is spades and there's a nice game in that beautiful box. It's a light game, but the games plays quickly. The set collection and area control aspects of the game work nicely together, providing some tension and decent choices to be made. Turns are quick and easy, the only problem being that I never have time to enjoy the flavor text!

The board is lovely (like EVERYTHING ELSE in the game), and the Ferris Wheel car advancing the game along is wonderful. The game may wear thin if played too much, but the game seems like it will play somewhat differently each time based on the luck of the draw.

This game was easily a 10 the first couple of times we played.  I still LOVE this game and it remains one of my top 10-20 favorite games.  We purchased it in April and have 9 plays in already.  The only reason I don't give it 10 stars is that after the initial "I loooove this game", I don't want to play it every single day anymore.  It still gets pulled out every weekend we have time to sit down and game, and has been thoroughly enjoyed by everyone we've played it with.  (Including older parents who don't like anything with complicated rules or too many icons.)

Pros:
+ Nice art and components
+ Light enough to use as a gateway (or step up from gateways)
+ Point salad - feels much more like a heavier Euro
+ Scores tend to be pretty tight *most* of the time
+ Competitive without too much "take that"
+ Plays well at all player counts, and is great with 2P

Cons:
- None?  My only complaint is that it takes up a little more space on the table and can feel kind of cluttered when basically every space is full of cards.  But that's just a nitpicky complaint!

World fair combines set-collection with area-control, but not in a way that really makes any sense.  You place pawns in one of five regions in order to collect the cards that are randomly dealt to that region.  The cards you gain will typically apply to the other regions, forcing you to place pawns in those other regions in order for your cards to actually matter.   This rapidly devolves into a vicious cycle of you either having the sets you need but not the area-control or having pawns in the areas you want but not the cards you need.

The game is easy to learn but the strategy is difficult (if not impossible) to master due to how often the available cards change between turns.

A lot of work went into the art of this game, but it's mostly pointless.  The board itself is great, especially the modular ferris wheel that adjusts the length of each round depending on the number of players, but the cards are just full of distracting graphics and text.

Light set collection and area control game that plays in about 30 minutes at 2p.  I really like how the design of the cards is very minimal -- all that's truly necessary for gameplay are the icons in the corner, so the rest of the card consists of an image and historical description of whatever is on the card.  Very cool.  If I had one complaint it's that I wish there were about 20 more cards so there wasn't a need to reshuffle the discard pile back into a new draw deck.

Very well made, stream-lined area control/set collection game. I've noticed the theme seems to turn people off a lot. Beneath that, however, is a very tight game. Simple, yet tactical turns, three sources of points, and gateway game level of play. Seriously, try this one out.

I backed this via Kickstarter and only recently received it. It's kind of like Colosseum or Steam Park, except you're building a World's Fair - specifically the one in Chicago? That's the setting anyway.

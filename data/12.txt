One of the first games I played upon my recent reintroduction to board games, and it was a good one for that purpose. The auction mechanism creates enough uncertainty that it doesn't suffer from euro-predictability-syndrome. Another play might slightly increase the rating.

RATING: 9
What an awesome design. I love how the auctions generate random piles of stuff that players will value differently. I love how you have to factor in not just spending your bid tiles for the round, but more than likely giving them to someone else. I love that you can call the auction when it suits you to force other players' hands. And I love push-your-luck mechanics!

First time I've given the fabled "let's play again!" in as long as I can remember. Fast becoming a (very late to the party) Knizia fan. 

And having played the game, the FFG version looks to make the different tile functions really hard to internalise for new players. Plus I love the wooden sun tiles in the 'classic' version - leaning towards that one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fast and fun auction game.  There is a lot of competing tension between getting the tiles that stave off penalties, and grabbing tiles that provide immediate or long-term points.  The Ra tiles that come out can also bring horrible doom to those who get greedy.  Definitely one of Reiner's best.

Still most likely one of my favorite auction games, but not feeling a huge tug to replay again and again.  I suspect it has something to do with the fact my wife hates auctions.

Still a great game and still getting lots of plays (relatively speaking given our game jumpiness nowadays).  I agree with the sentiment it is an PYL game with an auction element.

Well a classic is such for a reason.  Takes a little to wrap the head around and player boards are very handy for noobs (albeit unecessary after the first play), but must say I like it quite a bit!  I think once I move to Cali, if I find a good 3p+ group I will very likely end up with the knizia auction quadrilogy.

Just played it a second and its already up to a 10 (admittedly in part due to the.  I had a horrendous first and second rounds (and wasn't even going for monuments) and yet was able to weasel my way into being second place so yeah, fun game with lots of ways to maneuver even when things aren't going your way.

Just tried it 2P.  Not bad, but there is better out there.  But hey, it wasn't originally a 2P game.

[I]tl;dr - Ra is an immensely entertaining auction game by Reiner Knizia -- the game is so good I want the published version![/I]
[COLOR=#CCCCFF]____________________________[/COLOR]

Ra is a simply complex auction game from Reiner Knizia that's very enjoyable. On your turn, you draw tiles from the bag one by one, gradually adding to the lot of tiles that are available for auction. Each turn, the player will decide if they want to draw another tile, or bid on the lot and claim it for their tableau. The catch? Each player has only three tokens to bid with -- and they may not be the value he'd like to spend on the lot. 

As such, Ra is a game of evaluating the bids everyone else has remaining, deciding when to pick up a lot with a bid, and making sure to avoid the end of the era with the Ra tiles. Ra tiles make the game even harder, forcing an auction on that turn -- when the board fills up with Ra tiles, the first age is over. After two more ages, the game ends. 

There are many ways to score points: from civilizations, to monuments, to Nile-side farms, to powerful God tiles. All in all, the meat of this game comes down to evaluating the current lot, deciding when to bid, and deciding when to push your luck. This is a brilliant game that has the potential to push 10 with me.

Rather than spend $60 for the new Windrider edition, I spent thrice that in time to craft my own sci-fi themed cardgame version of Ra, and it actually works quite well! We use poker chips for the money and everything fits together nicely. The sci-fi theme is just about as pasted on as the Egypt theme, but I thought it might appeal to more players in my group.

SOLD! As the girl will always want to play some different. Brilliant auction game that has everything. Outwitting your opponent through table talk, a risk-averse test, recalling which player has which auction tiles, set-collecting though not overly encouraging specialisation so all auctions are meaningful, negative scoring, every decision feels important. Nigh on perfect for what it does. Shame the girl is not a fan!

Fun auction game. It's a press your luck game with some fun extra elements that make me like it more than other similar games. Easy to learn, too.

Classic game that I'm proud to own. This is essentially an optimization game and even boarder-line mathy. As such, I'm surprised that I like it as much as I do.  I think it's the push your luck aspect that brings it out of the dull-drums. It's surprisingly deeper and more akin to poker in bluffing than anything else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ra is a bidding and set collection game with a closed economy. Closed economy in this case means that the game should balance itself through the bidding action. Of course, this implicitly means that there is a learning curve to the game because you cannot estimate the true value of the tiles offer on your first play. I liked the fact that in addition to bidding for tiles, closed economy means that you also bid for your position on the next round. So your choices have an impact on both short and long term.

The only thing that felt a bit weird and was a kind of anticlimax to the game, was the round ends. If there was only one player left in the game with more than one RA-tile short of triggering the round end, he was almost certain to get a full display of goodies without anyone being able to do anything about it. But I reckon this a thing to keep in mind and it is the other players' own fault if they let one player do whatever he likes.

Ra is a classic example of a modern game design without anything but the absolute necessary parts. The result is a game that, maybe is not that flashy and exciting at the first glance when compared with newer games, but offers an experience of reasonable length with a lot meaningful and tough decisions. I do admit that Ra might feel a bit dry at first but if you like bidding games, Ra definitely is one of the better ones. It also was a wonder how good the game feels with just 3 players, which is a rare treat in auction games. Thus Ra deserves a rather high rating.

Rating made after seven plays, so there may be changes.  Above all, this was fun.  It has a light feel, but underneath that there is a lot going on.  I felt that the mechanics were very clean and cleverly done, and even though the theme was somewhat bolted on, that didn't stop me enjoying the game.  Just how much of the tactical play proves to be illusory and how much randomness overcomes thinking is something I will be finding out about over the years, but right now, I think this is a very good game...it helps that I won my first (5 player) session - by using a few simple ideas ;)

Ra, Ra, Rasputin, Lover of the Egyptian Theme.
The single most important reason for enjoying Ra is for the improbable comedy headwear the ancient Egyptian Gods were so fond of wearing. It's a lot like an ancient animal-based leather fetishist fashion show. Ra's "Spaceball Bingo Hat" just edging out the God King-Croco-Snap's precariously balanced stack of waffles.

Fun bidding game. You are limited in what you can bid and how often you can bid which makes the bid timing very tactical. It is a set collecting game so the items you are bidding for have very different values for you compared to for your opponent. There are interesting strategies in how to force them to bid for something.

This is close to the perfect game. It has depth, the system is elegant, the components are beautiful and the play time is relatively short! Players are engaged at all times (with one exception: players who have completed 3 auctions must wait until the next epoch). Absolutley wonderful... now if only I could get my hands on a copy!

Update 2007 03 25: Still great after hundreds of plays. However, it should be played with 3... the game is simply not as balanced as the players increase.

+ One of the most interesting auction and set-collection games I've played.
- The iOS version of the game is so wonderful, it makes pulling the tiles out of the bag seem like a waste of time.


Why it's previously-owned:
This game is still great and constantly forces players to evaluate what the values of the different tiles are. It's still fun. But it's just so much faster in the iOS version. Another victim of technology. 
This got traded for Colossal Arena and Pergamon.

Ra felt fast paced, enjoyable to play, and lots of good strategy in how to best approach the points.  Random in a good way, and thematically enjoyable to play.

RATING: 7
My second favourite of Knizia's auction games (after Modern Art).  I especially like the mechanism that makes your bid have to take into account both the value of the past bid block (which is part of the auction parcel) and the value of giving the block you're bidding with to someone else (in the next auction parcel).  That opens up a world of lowball bid strategies (as does the way people can speed or slow the bidding cycle to suit their tiles).

Early days, but so far my favorite pure auction game. It's quite tense and exciting, and fixed bids make it easy to jump into the game even if you are inexperienced, whereas auction games are often intimidating for newcomers.

The game has lots of tactical elements (because you win bidding tokens you will be able to use next round, the buildup of auction sets, etc), but still allows for a strategy buildup (set collection through the three ages)

Still, I got crushed.

The games has a super fast setup, plays in less than one hour, has zero downtime. Great game for a weekday.

Ra is a subtle and demanding game. It is also a game that I want to like more, but (a) it "suffers" from "location impotence" -- if you sit between players who like to force auctions, you are going to have real trouble getting a good tile selection, and (b) it is an auction game, and I like auctions as a mechanism, not as [b]the[/b] mechanism of the game...

If you like auction games, you need to play Ra. If you don't like auction games you are not going to like Ra, regardless of its devious auction system.

I love Reiner Knizia, and I love this auction game of his.  It is so unique and so interesting and fits together so nicely.  In Knizia form, this game has the simplest of decisions being so hard to make.  Every choice is interesting, and you really feel that you are playing well or not based on the choices.  There is a push your luck element with big gains for succeeding and big loses for pushing too far. Seriously, I love this game.

I need to figure this game out. I still haven't won. I love playing it. I'm engaged on every turn, but I think I just play too conservatively or too aggressively to be good at this game.

This game keeps me coming back even though I constantly lose. Definitely a winner.

Mechanically very interesting, but not really my sort of game.  Surprisingly fiddly when it comes down to point optimization, and players can find themselves stuck in awkward cycles where they have to keep calling auctions.  Would play it again, but no desire to own it.

The stats from other players rate it highly, but having played it four times, I'm still a bit cool on this one. To be fair, its supporters say that it needs playing a few times to get the 'buzz', but I'm not sure that I'll ever get that playing 'Ra'. Two reasons A)Bidding game, don't enjoy these a whole lot, and B) Reiner. He's either good or he's mediocre, and some of his stuff just doesn't suit me. I've a gut feeling that this falls into the latter. Shame.

Ra is a pure auction game and yet it asks its players plenty of difficult questions.  Which of three types of tile that accumulate throughout the game will be my focus?  How concerned am I about point losses for fewest Pharaohs and no civs?  Do I really want to exchange my 16 point bid for a one point bid next epoch?  What is this set worth to me, him and her? Should I add to it or call Ra? Above all, how long til the end of the epoch (I lied, this is also a push your luck game)?

While my play has become somewhat formulaic, I always find some fun in this game. Ra has become a popular standby in my gaming circles. 

My Alea edition is well produced and pleasing to the eye.

RATING: 8
Ra is a fairly quick set collection auction game that I think is (game designer) Reiner Knizia's loose take on poker.

Gameplay decisions are tied to probabilistic risk assessment and Ra sure does make that into some hedge your bets vs. go-for-broke fun.  Consequently skill at Ra is best judged over multiple plays of the game, not winning any particular instance.

Plays well with 3, 4, or 5.  Takes 30+ mins.
---------------------------------------------------
First play was a big hit!  Myself and three game-friendly-not-really-gamer friends had a lot of fun in a 'trial run' to figure out the rules.  It took me about 20-30 minutes to read through the rules and get an idea of what was going on.  Once that was finished we threw ourselves into the game and after a little bit the brilliance of the game started to show up.  We are looking forward to playing more soon!

Ooh, I liked this. I need to start playing more 'classics' like this. I liked the way you bid and lose your bidding stone, but then you could immediately try to get it back. Push your luck and bidding are some of my favorite mechanics, so this is excellent in my book.

Excellent game with some unique mechanics in the auction.  I've played this one three player and I found it to work very well.  I've also played several 5 player games.

An old classic I've owned for quite a while, though I've only played it periodically over the years.  Historically I've never done particularly well.  One of my friends decided to devote a game night to this so I read a couple of reviews of the game and thought a bit more analytically about how the game works, as opposed to just winging it.  Lo and behold, I managed to win for the first time!  The key I think is recognizing what to do when you have low value suns and adapting to how your opponents behave when they have low value suns.

RATING: 5
Mathematically sound. Thematically unsound. :P

Also it has serious problems or rather it demands a standard playgroup to really shine. Specifically if there is a new player in the group, the game will be unbalanced because it is not possible for a single player to counter one other player's efforts by himself alone. 
This precondition demands strict playgroup parameters for the game to be good. I consider this a VERY BAD trait in a game hence the low rating.

I do not understand this game's appeal. I play it under duress, and not very often. People try to convince themselves that this is a gamer's game. Well, I wouldn't inflict this one on a newbie, but it's glorified random tile pulling and gambling that Ra looks down fondly upon your fate.  would gladly sacrifice myself to the gods not to play this one again...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm really surprised by how Ra manages to cram so much variety in practically a single decision for the whole game. You're constantly asking yourself "Is this a good time to call an auction?", "Is this a good pool to bet my 9 on?", etc. and it's painfully hard to decide every single time. Solid game. I expect that it'll stay as a staple of my collection for many years to come.

I grow fonder of this game each time I play it.  It's sort of Advanced Medici (also a wonderful game).  And as great as this game is, the graphic design is even better.  [I was talking about the original Alea edition] It's not just that the tiles look great, the artwork is incredibly helpful in showing you how scoring works... and the scoring system is "busy" here - enough to be a little confusing your first game (or two).  Another great effort by Knizia and Vohwinkel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite auction game!  So many subtle decisions to make.  Just slightly better than Razzia, if only because of the disaster tiles.  These tiles add so much variability in terms of "lot value" for any given player in the game.  It is pretty tough if there is a poison pill for all players but one who can keep it going.

A great Reiner Knizia classic.  Great bits, simple to learn for even non-gamers, and lots of strategy.  Has a "press your luck" element along with auction tension.

[2010] El juego consta de 3 días. Cada día, los jugadores pueden comprar hasta 3 lotes de tiles. El día acaba cuando todos los jugadores han comprado sus 3 lotes o cuando los espacios para Ra han sido llenados. Los tiles dan puntos inmediatos o al final del juego, o incluso sirven para evitar perder puntos. Algunos tiles se conservan a lo largo del juego, mientras que otros se pierden al final de cada día. Quien tenga más puntos al final del tercer día será el ganador.

I changed my rating from an 8 to a 5. This is to reflect how I now feel about Ra. It's a very clean auction game but luck can totally screw you over and if you play with the wrong people the game is dead.

RATING: 6
Like most of Knizia's games, Ra is mechanically sound. I can see how at one time the clever design of this game impressed game fans. The problem is clever mechanics the only important aspects of a game. They need to also be fun and interesting. The first few times you play it, you feel the former up until you realize it doesn't have much of the latter. A good but not great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My favorite auction game and among my favorite three player games.  It moves quickly but it's constantly posing tough decisions to each player.

There's a wide assortment of tiles that group up and score in different ways.  Some score immediately, some score later, some only score for one player but not another, and some will even hurt some players but not others.  Figuring out what each stash is worth to you (and to a lesser extend, everyone else) is rarely obvious.

Instead of bidding whatever you want, you have to use one of a finite group of fixed value tokens.  There's a lot to consider which token is worth the pot.

And finally, there's a push your luck element in that the round can end before everyone has taken something with each of their tokens.  This pushes players both ways.  Get out early to avoid not cashing in your tokens.  But if you stay in to the end you might be able to clean up with no competition.

i like the game, but i really prefer razzia.  the biggest reason is that i find razzia's art much more intuitive, although i think it's easier to shuffle/grab cards than it is to pass around a bag too.  i know there are player aids, and there's experience which makes the whole situation straightforwrad.  it's still frustrating to have difficult art design for no apparent reason, and it makes it much harder to teach.  i'm beginning to see the value in the disaster tiles, to the point that i'm considering buying a second copy of razzia and completely cloning ra with it.

What a terrific bidding game!  I usually tire of games where bidding is the core mechanic, but Ra struts its stuff by making the tiles you're bidding on worth different amounts to different players.  The fact that everyone's tiles are in the open adds a little analysis and a lot of tension.  

I was disappointed with my last two Knizia purchases (Ingenious and Through the Desert), but he's bedazzled me again with Ra.

Ra is simple, easy-to-learn, and deep.  I like how a numerically inferior hand can end up powerful by forcing auctions and depleting everyone else.  The sun token you get from winning an auction is at least as important as what tiles you pick up, which I don't think is obvious at first.

You need to understand what to get in Ra and when. There is also a lot of luck involved. I also sometimes forget what each tile means. You can manipulate to get the higher numbers (bidding sun tokens) so that you start with better numbers at the next part of the game. You also should say “Ra“ at the right time. And you should know when you really need to win the auction.

RATING: 8
A fine auction game. It balances different needs for different players perfectly, and including the currency as a prize in the auction is something never done before, yet the cause of excellent results.

UPDATE: I decided I love it's push-your-luck mechanics and it's "set collection" background. It's very likely it will be part of my next game order.

UPDATE: Just bought it. Will post back my comments on the actual board game (rather than the BSW version)

UPDATE: Played twice with my gaming group. They actually loved it! It's a great game, and my single fear that it wouldn't be much of a "non-gamer's game" was completely proven wrong. Rating has gone up to a perfect 10!

UPDATE: We've played a lot out of this one, and it still hits the table on a regular basis. It no longer feels like a perfect 10 for me, though. It's a bit worn out already, and we simply have better choices these days. Down to a 9.

UPDATE: I still love to play it, but I rarely suggest it as a first choice anymore. Down to an 8.

RATING: 5.5
Sufficiently different to my other games to keep, but not always the most enjoyable experience. The problem is the frequency of those Ra tiles which trigger the end of an epoch; often this happens with several players having unused bids, sometimes you'll even get a player who has not won a single bid. Whole epochs go buy with some players adding little or nothing to their stock of tiles. Can be quite frustrating.

This is a lovely game. The subtle twists in the auction mechanics add so much. Unequal bidding capability, combined with every player attaching a different value to each set up for auction, combined with optional and required auctions and the chance of a discard of all the pieces if a player waits too long. It draws you forward over the table to enjoy over and over again.

After one play, I came away very impressed with the ease of the gameplay.  We had three people, which it played VERY well for.  We had much fun chanting for Ra to be pulled from the bag.  Also really enjoyed the decision making of when to bid or not on the tiles.  Expect that this rating could actually climb.  --UPDATE-- After a few more plays, have moved the rating to a 10.  This is specifically for 3 players, as it seems to be optimal.  Have yet to play with 4 or 5.

RATING: 9
We were playing it incorrectly in the first 6 times we played it.  We kept tiles that didn't have the stars on them to the next epoch, which obviously breaks the game.  I am now loving this game because it is so fast and a lot of tension.  I also like the push your luck component of the game.  

Updated (9/17/06): 7 -> 8

Update: Sep 30, 2007
This is a great game.  This can handle 3-4 players very well but I actually prefer playing it with 3 since it gives you more control.  You can time calling Ra's easier with that number count.  The passing of the bag annoys me for some reason, which keeps this game from reaching 10 at the moment.

Ok where to start....I like this game, I would even go so far to say I love this game...but.....

Whilst the new version is beautiful, has a bunch of tiles and all components are wonderful quality it just for some reason doesn't feel like a £45 game.

It's very light, plays more like a filler with games lasting 30 mins or so. Furthermore whilst the components are very nice they are still only cardboard at the end of the day and (there isn't even a game insert/inlay) they don't justify the price tag. This would have been a great £25-£30 game.

I'm not saying I regret buying this top game as it is so much fun, its just the price tag and kind of one mechanic (albeit a great mechanic) over and over again that makes it feel very light.

EDIT: The one mechanic/choice every turn soon became tiresome and so traded away

Ra was my favorite entry-level game for a long time.  However, there are plenty of other entry-level games out there that are just as good to play as Ra.  I hadn't played many games back then.  As for gameplay, the push-your-luck aspect provides a heavy dose of excitement.  There is a TON of luck, but that should be expected.

Ra is my first 10.

RATING: 5
It is a light game of trying to win the auctions that most benefit you while forcing players to spend their funds on those that may not be as great as they could be... There is also an element of chance, as you may press your luck and see if the gods are favorable with more resources if you are the last one with bidding capacity. If have enjoyed my few playings but I don't get excited about playing a strict auction game. I much prefer auctions included among other mechanics, such as Power Grid, Struggle of Empires, Evo, etc.

"The game spans 1500 years of Egyptian history in less than an hour!"  

Paste on themes much, Mr. Knizia?  I'm thinking you have some gremlins that do that for you, while you come up with the actual game play.

Anyhoo.  Of his auction games that I've played (would like to check out Amun-Re and Dream Factory...maybe also High Society and Money), this falls behind Modern Art and Medici.

A fellow gamer taught this game to me last week in preparation for our monthly game night.  I quite enjoyed it, and quickly learned the fine art of when to call an auction and when to be patient.  With just two players the game lacked what I'm sure 4 or 5 players will bring...so much more tension as to when to bid or not.  I'm truly looking forward to a multiple player game and will more than likely update rating...hopefully in the positive direction.  Update forthcoming.

wonderful auction system that is simple to explain but a little tricky to utilise.  Baked onto this are standard Knizia type varieties of scoring for all of the different types of tiles and you have a very fun game.  Occasionally I do feel the disaster tiles add a bit too much randomness to the mix but they do provide a bit of catch up as people with lots of tiles already are more likely to be negatively impacted.  I like Razzia a tiny bit more as a game but the whole tile thing is nice.

[i]Posted: 7/27/09, Rated: 9[/i]

"Life is like a sewer: What you get out of it, depends upon what you put into it." - Tom Lehrer

That's about as metaphysical of a statement as I can think of to try to describe [i]Ra[/i].  It is a classic Knizia design: very solid auction mechanics, an intricate scoring schedule, and an Egyptian theme.

I'm not the kind of player to complain about themes being "pasted on," by the way.  A game that is overly thematic tends to have fiddly rules in order to support that theme.  A game with simple, elegant rules is often accused of having its theme "pasted on."  Hogwash.  I prefer games with streamlined rules which can be evaluated objectively.  Theme is a subjective element: the richness of the game world can either increase or diminish the overall experience.  [i]Ra[/i] has a set of well-defined rules which are easy to understand.  The artwork and production value of my copy -- in other words, the execution of the Egyptian "theme" -- greatly enhances my enjoyment of this game.

The foundation of this game is "pushing your luck."  You can try to get more tiles, or you can try to purchase the ones that are already displayed.  You can go too far, though, and end up with nothing.  Such brinksmanship is a solid start to any game.

The challenge of an auction mechanism is found in learning how to value the items up for bid.  In fact, I contend that the longer it takes to acquire this skill, the more enjoyment can be squeezed from a game like [i]Ra[/i].  Once that learning curve has been surmounted, an auction game becomes more deterministic.  And it is here that [i]Ra's[/i] convoluted scoring schedule is both a benefit and a curse: it can take a long time to learn how to value all of the different types of tiles.  Five games would be just a start.  With my family, it's hard to get a game of this weight to the table that many times if they're not "getting it."  By the same token, it is this complexity which gives [i]Ra[/i] longer gaming legs.  It's a paradox.

What does help is the fixed bid mechanism: you can only bid one of your "sun tiles," and there is only one round of bidding.  [i]Ra[/i] pulls this off with far more aplomb than the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i]-winning [i][thing=110]Auf Achse[/thing][/i].  Their fixed amounts also relax the need to precisely calculate the value of an auction lot.  The interplay between value and purchasing power, flowing on a river of chance is where the beauty of [i]Ra[/i] truly resides.

If I had to pare my collection down to a small number of titles, then [i]Ra[/i] would definitely make the cut.  As it stands today, it's a beautifully-produced game with strong mechanics that doesn't drive enough demand.  We haven't been willing to invest the necessary time to get our full measure of enjoyment from it.

Another gateway that is surprisingly great for bringing the kids (8+) into the gaming space. Naturally the younger ones love screamin' "RA!!!!" when slamming down the Ra piece; gets them totally into the game. And the set collection is a good mechanic for them. Surprising amount of depth in the decision making here - the randomization of running out of Ra peices too soon really adds a bit of tension to the play.

RATING: 10
An excellent (atypical) auction game, and simply excellent game overall. The theme is utterly irrelevant except to provide some visual/conceptual reminders of each tile's function and to make the game visually appealing, but I don't mind that Ra is abstract in this way. (Of course auctioning paintings or houses makes more sense, but if Ra is the better game, does it really matter?) Ra's bidding mechanic (the winner of an auction gains a bidding marker as a part of the current lot, and contributes his to the next) is very clever, and the push-your-luck aspect of drawing tiles (especially when only one player can bid) is good fun. The scoring mechanics are manageable and (critically) result in most lots being at least reasonably valuable to all players (especially when there is time to shift scoring strategies), which is crucial in a game with this much chance. Some may consider the randomness of the draw a downside, but I view it as simply another thing a player must attempt to value: one must attach a value to not only the tiles currently in the lot, but also the tiles that [i]may[/i] be added if no one bids (which may be good or bad!), the likelihood that the desired tiles will be drawn, and the likelihood of being able to use all bidding markers before the round ends. Of course, no one can evaluate this type of uncertainty perfectly and everyone gets burned now and then, but for a game of this weight I don't mind it at all. Ra packs a lot of decisions and competition into a very accessible and playable game. Truly wonderful.(2012-03; revised 2014-02)

A game that was on my shelf a long time before it got to the table.

First play: I was pleasantly surprised at how simple the rules were but immediately aware that there was significant depth of strategy as my 3 other experienced opponants set about gambits that utterly escaped me.

Immediately struck by the brinksmanship elements of the game and nail biting nerve required. Whilst not immediately bowled over, I'd be very keen to play again.

Second play and I have warmed to this considerably, it seems there is a transition of learning the strategies that needs to be overcome before the real depth of the game is appreciated. Certainly a chunk of luck but managable luck.

RATING: 8
Great game, doesn't get to the table enough.  It is very simple as each turn you have only three choices of what to do.  You have three or four tiles in which to bid, this makes the Game nicely balanced as people who bid high one round may not have the opporuntiy to bid high the next round. Looking forward to palying again...even though we have a RA shark in our group.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The Egyptian theme appeals to me. Easy to teach and the length is good at 45-60 min. The only knock on this one is the amount of luck the drawbag brings, but decisions about when to bid is the key to this one. Also has a press your luck element as the round may end before you get a chance to win three auctions.

For a while I thought I would be sent off to the afterlife with my own unopened copy of Ra for the journey, but after 5 years on our shelf we finally broke its seal!

p: People keep telling me this is an auction game. I guess it is, and the flood of auctions is certainly a hint. Yet somehow it didn't feel like one at all. It has recently dawned on me which auction games I do like: it's the ones that allow me to play poker with other people's impulse to play chicken. And trying to find the offer that is to poor to take but to costly to let go is what this game is all about. Mentioning auction games to me triggers many scarred memories of playing rich-getting-richer games until whatever arbitrary victory condition was met, usually involving me losing all my money. This is the other sort, the Knizia one.

Values of tiles are relative as they are different for each player. Each player can win an equal amount of auctions and only has set values to bid with, triggering an intriguing dance of high and low bidding tiles. Winning tiles with a low bid can be far more important than securing a high value set with the highest one, and forcing the play of a high value bid on a mediocre set of tiles  is where judgment calls and skill will shine through. Triggering auctions with low values to pose dilemmas for those holding the powerful bid tiles is crucial, and your success at using  this mechanism will make or break the game for you. Hey, even the game mechanism itself poses its own dilemmas, as hanging on for a better set can be risky as the game round can end abruptly, but strangely tempting too as the rewards can be huge.

I understand some people dislike the "luck of the draw" element, but to me that is arguing against the one element that is crucial to the make-up and enjoyment of this game. It's like saying Bridge would be so much better if only people had more control over the cards they were dealt at the start. Dealing with what is presented in front of you is ALL the challenge here, and Knizia has come up with a rather nice series of additional balances that guarantees that no single move can be a winning move, and that most moves also benefit other players in those dark and mysterious trickling down ways of his.

Whether you like this or not will for a large part depend on how intuitive maths comes to you. There are a lot of gamers around here who will rank this as a "light" game, but I can see several people in my immediate surroundings who are frequent, well-versed and enthusiastic gamers, who will find weighing up the relative and interlinked values of the tiles to themselves and other players quite hard work, and slightly off-putting, especially against players who can spot mathematical formulas in their breakfast cereal. On the whole, if you don't run away screaming when you have to figure out the relative value of each situation, this will make for some of the best dilemma gaming you can think of. However, I am not alway in the mood to play a game where contsant concentration is a requirement, and this one certainly is one of those. We also have the sort of group in which this is played slightly slower than it could be.

I haven't made my mind up if I prefer this over "Medici" or not, and for instance "Geschenkt" seems to pose a similar level of challange, judgement and risk-taking in a much simpler game. I do like this a lot, but how much will only become clear with further plays.

Auction game with a nice mechanic, works between two people very well because of the nice aucution mechanic.  The different types of set scoring used also make the game interesting, as you and your opponent will start valuing certain objects differently.  And you can never get enough Pharoahs.

After playing two real-life games and several against AI, I feel pretty confident saying that this game is brilliant. It takes the inherently fun and suspenseful press-your-luck formula and adds healthy tactical depth by both presenting it using constant turn rotation (whodathunk THAT was possible?) and combining it with an elegant pseudo-auction mechanic. This is the sort of simple but deep game that very few people in the world would be able to create, but Knizia is one of them.

RATING: 6
I think I figured it out.  
1.) Who doesn't like out-gaming and scoring stuff at auctions?  It's like ebay - the game.

2.) But the thing is, even if you win your auctions, and you do a good job...the larger picture in mind is what really matters, and it's hard to accurately get that big picture to mean something per the randomness of the tiles.  Because every auction that comes up is ultimately worth something, so why not try to win everything?

It comes down to, I like luck, but at a certain point you might as roll a dice, and whatever player number comes up, declare him or her the winner, and Ra is dangerously close to that with quite a few direct luck-to-win moments.

...all this said, I do like to play this game, and that's ultimately what matters.  

Knizia tends to either have too much luck and little think-ahead for my taste, or he creates an experience where winning because of luck and strategy creates a feeling of euphoria and smugness unparalleled except by winning a large sum of money at a roulette wheel.  This is his finest work that I've played.

04-03-14
Lowered to a '7', maybe even a 6.  I played this a bunch on the ipad, and I'm absolutely sick of it. Every other game...  I play smart, and sure enough, someone plays risky and essentially wins the game by drawing 47 tiles before being the only bidder and getting it.

Don't get me wrong, I love luck...  but it seems like the rule rather than the exception and when it does swing in one direction, it destroys the game.   

I love other games where I perpetually roll '1' or something, and that doesn't bother me because usually that is some incredibly bad luck...you just have to enjoy it for what it is.  With this, I feel like there's a 50/50 shot at it just being a pure-luck experience.

Sold:  The feel of this game HAS to exist in an easier to teach package with less game-breaking frustration.  SWAT works, but I'm thinking even better.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2011/12/ra.html]Ra[/url] es un juego rápido (en tu turno se realiza una única acción de entre tres posibles), con un factor medio-alto de azar que da emoción e incertidumbre a la partida y a la vez es motivo de frustración para muchos. Su corta duración lo hace soportable.

Okay so Ra is an auction game, yes. But in my mind the real game under that pretty, ancient Egyptian wrapping (no, not the mummified kind) is about knowing [i]when[/i] to call an auction more than what happens once the bidding actually starts. It's about timing, about forcing your opponents to bid on slightly worse lots than they'd like, about pushing your luck to get a big payoff before Ra closes out the round. I love it. It's quick, it's that special mix of rules-light but gameplay-deep, and you get to exclaim to the table, "I INVOKE RA!" in your most dramatic voice. I could see this one going up to a 9 with more plays.

Awesome game. I'll play anytime, anywhere...forever!. Love the time-efficiency. Love the setup. Love the balance of luck and skill. Love the psychology. People who bring math to this game are missing the point and won't "get" this game.

Love the theme and the aspects that stay beyond one epoch and aspects that are destroyed with each epoch. Epoch, that's pronounced EEpock or EHpock. Get it right, not epic.

A well-executed auctioning game. Good production with vibrant tiles and one of the best auction concepts I've seen to date. The "negative" tiles force players to make tough decisions on some auction blocks. The scoring methods are diverse with points being awarded for the winners in certain categories (and occasionally subtracted for other categories) as well certain sets of tiles. Players can only win a maximum of 9 auction blocks, which makes for an exciting game of chicken as the game ends when everyone has used up their final auction token or when the Ra tiles (used to drive the pace of the game and encourage bidding) have reached a certain limit.

Ra is an interesting asynchronous auction game with quite a bit of randomness... yet, I feel like the better players win most of the time.  And, I rarely won this game through my first 25 plays.

Once you've got the scoring down for the sets of tiles, and the bid and switch bidding tile mechanism, this game is a nice straight-forward bidding game.

My rating would be a little higher, except I think there is potential to get screwed in this game if you end up with all low bidding tiles after a round.  I guess the argument against that would be, "Well don't let that happen." ...

In Ra, you are pushing your luck to see what tiles come out which you will be bidding on using a closed system of sun tiles with numbers 1-16. On your turn you can either draw a tile to add to the row, or "invoke ra" and start a round of bidding. The tiles have some set collection, with permanent and temporary tiles, and among those are ra tiles which automatically start a round of bidding, and will end the round once you have enough of them.

I honestly didn't think much of this game during my first play, but shortly afterward the cleverness of the bidding system started to dawn on me. While pretty simple to learn (probably next step past gateway), there are always interesting choices here. It seems to move at a good clip, doesn't seem very prone to AP, and while an early lead is certainly positive, you are never really out of the game, as a daring push in the last round could net you a lot of points. just watch out for that last ra tile...

At last I got to try this game. Only played it once, and I clearly didn't understand all the strategies involved, but I really enjoyed myself. With more plays I would probably rate this an 8. The "pull chit out of a bag" mechanism is something I always enjoy, and the push-your-luck feeling and sett collection part was also really cool. Calling this an auction game is in some part misleading, since the other parts of the game are just as important. I usually don't enjoy auction games, but this one I liked.

Update: I realized after my first play how much I kept thinking about the game and had to buy it. It is easily an 8 now, and could rise. Plays great with two.

Great fun, easy to learn by playing and short enough to stay absorbing without becoming repetitive. Nice tiles and board too.

*Update* Over 40 plays and this one is a perennial favourite.

One play. Pure bidding/auction games are hard to enjoy the first time I play them, and this is no different.  I can tell there is a game here, almost certainly a good one if this site is anything to go by, but I don't have a strong desire to explore this one further.  My wife and I agree on this.

I know what it is I dislike:  Bidding on several items of random junk, trying to collect the best combinations of random junk.  There's dozens of these types of games out there and I dislike them all.

I like Razzia slightly more due to the theme.

I enjoy this one okay, but boy, do I stink at it.  For me, this is an okay auction game.  The theme, while good, really doesn't jive well with the mechanics.

Fun game from Reiner Knizia about developing your own personal ancient Egyptian civilization over several epochs. You really do get a sense that you're creating a culture in this one. While I'm not a huge fan of the auction element found in it, I do enjoy the tension that can come about when you really don't want that Ra tile to appear. Plus the, "take that" potential of outbidding an opponent on a good auction is rewarding.

RATING: 9
Ra is a classic thoroughly deserving of a reprint, one of the few good Knizia introductory games.  The only potential complexity concerns the scoring.  In fact, I would say this is the ultimate introductory game as it blends simplicity with a distinctively Euro feel.  Often introductory games, while decent family games, fail to provide the crucial stepping stone implied by the term "introductory."  Ra is vintage Knizia and lets face it, any solid gamer will play quite a few of his games.

Of course, particularly appealing is the ability to blame any loss on the luck of the tile draws, when more likely lack of piety towards Ra is the culprit.  Actually, luck forms the only significant flaw.  Playing a perfect game never ensures a win.  Skillful play mitigates the randomness, but Ra remains to its core a game of luck. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very interesting bidding mechanism, with a bit of press-your-luck thrown in.  Quick play time is an added bonus.  There's a lot to keep track of and the decisions on when and how much to bid are always interesting (and agonizing).

How can a game with so few options be so good? I've been trying to figure this question out since the first time I played Ra. This game just works. Thats it. For whatever reason it just does. The "push your luck" part of the game is a ton of fun for everyone playing whether your the one drawing or one of the three other people screaming for a red tile to come up. And there is always that one person who has the 1, 4, and 6 suns who yells RA!! every freaking turn. To add, it takes 5 minutes to learn and 20 minutes to play making it my gateway game of choice.

Although this might be a good game if you replay it a lot it didn't appeal to me the first time I played it, mainly because of its complexity at that moment in time.  Even after playing one game I still wasn't sure about some rules of the game.

I have played against the AI on the computer and I like it a lot, better than Razzia because of the disasters tiles. I'm getting a Ra copy soon, it's one of those games that must be in every game collection. 

Until then, I would keep playing it on the computer and also his little son [b]Ra:The Dice Game[/b] which is a great filler.

Finally my gaming friends gave me a copy as a birthday present. WOW!

I've only played once, and was not so impressed. It was sort of funny though when I asked what would happen if I went negative on the money, and I was reassured that no one had ever went negative before, so don't worry about it... well guess what happened?

Ever since I started gaming for real this has been a favorite and most played. I have won and lost this game multiple times by one point (though I've only had one tiebreaker, strangely enough). Rarely are you out of the game till the end nor are you ever secure in winning till the end. Always a nail-biter even with newbies! Frustration factor on certain decisions of auctions (though that's often part of the fun, too)

This is a fun game with a great auction mechaninc.  I would really play other games most of the time, but this only takes like 30-45 min. with the group I play with so we throw it in every once in awhile.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Just okay.  Too much randomness in the tile draws.  Moderate learning curve.  I prefer the 3p game because it's easier to mitigate luck when you have more chances to buy tiles (compared to the 4 & 5p games).

UPDATE 2014:  I'm just not fond of the bidding and randomness/push-your-luck combined with the game constraints/penalties for not collecting certain items.  A few players usually do well, while the rest struggle to get the required items. The result is a very unsatisfying, luck-heavy game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game.  Some people dislike the theme, and have had more fun with the cops/robbers theme of 'Razzia!'.  For me, the Egyption theme is what makes the game, the artwork is fantastic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A simple game that still manages to be very intricate and strategic. An auction mechanism that barely feels like an auction (this is a plus in my book). Once you get the scoring down (which is mindbending, not surprisingly, thanks Knizia), this is also a pretty fast game - we whipped through three 3-player games in a couple hours. This is the game that convinced me that I don't dislike all auction/bidding games.

I always lose this game because I am too impulsive in buying lots too early.  I _LOVE_ invoking RA when I know my opponents don't want me to ;-)  I usually have fun playing though.  I usually do badly in the final round since I don't value Monuments enough early in the game.  This fact mimics my general style: "Strong tactical play up front but poor long term strategy / vision."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Some call it dry with a pasted-on theme. Probably right on both accounts but that doesn't stop it being a cracking auction game that gets better with every play. The 'push-your-luck' aspect that can arise generates much laughter and shouts of encouragement.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ra is a great addition to my library and fills an important niche: a title that I can get other players (not necessarily boardgame geeks) into fairly easily, provides high amount of fun factor and still manages to be a nice blend between mentally challenging and breezy.  Glad I finally bought this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fine auction game, but you're more at the mercy of the luck gods than in many auction games.  A clump of Ra tiles coming up together can turn your winning strategy into disaster, and there isn't much you can do about it.

This is definitly the best auction game avaiable.
Every game plays so different because of the dramatic and uncertainty of the draw tile. No game is same because of the tiles-outlay and the behavior of your competitors drives the game winning tactic, and the right amount of luck.

It`s a materpiece of Knizia.

RATING: 7.8
Great Game.  It is easy to teach and for new players pick up.  It is another Euro classic and I would say if You had to have one of 5 games for other people this is one of them.  

It is well constructed and pretty to look at and some players have made useful tools etc to make its theme even pop more than it can.  It is fun with a group that gets into the game and ends up chanting Ra!..Ra!...Ra!!... In hopes that some hapless architect of ancient egypt struggles to make his place in history-- maybe that person will draw a turn-stopping tile crushing their hopes, and furthering your success...

It is referred to as a bidding game sometimes, but I also think of it a resource management.  In the sense that even money is traded for... other money.  

Points are scored in 3 phases(epics) and then there are special groups of tiles gathered through the epics that cmoe into play at the end game.  You want to get combinations/collections of tiles that are randomly drawn from a bag and you want to avoid being left without other various tiles or it will cost you.  Do you bid now to get some tile to prevent loss or do you hold out trying to glean more tiles....?

This game is good to teach some non-gamers as the learning curve would be short for newbies.

Does not feel like an auction game, possibly due to the one round of bidding. It mostly seems to be a game of press your luck. Or a game of chicken. It still has strategy in what to bid on and when.

The two player variant seemed to work quite well. I won by only one point. Have only played one two layer game so far.

Traded away.  Auction games are difficult to get to the table for me.  They presume some knowledge of what things are worth in the game in order to play well, and therefore require multiple plays.  I don't play regularly enough to devote several plays to building competence in valuation in a specific system.  I still think this is a very good game, but it is not one that has a place in my collection.


Played once.  Auction games usually take some time to learn, but my initial impression, despite not knowing what I was doing, was that it is a very clever game.

Un juego de subastas muy interesante. Se van colocando losetas en un track. La subasta surge cuando alguien invoca a Ra o cuando sale una loseta determinada. Cuando eso sucede, cada jugador puede hacer SOLO UNA puja por el set completo.

Las losetas se puntúan de diversas formas. Hay tres rondas.. y en cada ronda hay losetas que desaparecen.. Otras puntúan cuando acaba la partida. Está muy bien el juego.

Para muchos, lo mejor que hizo knizia. Desde luego es un buen juego de subastas.

Like this game a lot. As there are several things to look at through the game.
You need to have a good picture of your own and your opponents tiles to be able to see when you need to call RA. Also important is to see that you have good value Sun tiles to be able to react and act in the next epoch.

Very fun, and quick to learn. One needs to know the scoring rules by heart of otherwise it can be hard to bid on the right tiles.

This has become my favorite auction-game.

This is my favorite Knizia bidding game. It includes several scoring options to balance and consider, diminishing the element of 'luck of the draw.' Need to compromise some element of your scoring strategy or you will lose the opportunity to score anything. Theme is actually present with the invoking of Ra implying his favor for blessings upon the four developments. This may be a bit shallow, but it works for an ancient Egyptian theme. The game also includes beautiful graphics with the tiles and on the board itself.  Very tough decisions when it comes to deciding whether to call or participate in an auction, and how much to commit when wanting only to bluff. Really scales well from 3 - 5 players. Love it!

A filler/stand-by push-your-luck auction game. *Very LUCK dependent*

Update from March 2007 to Feb 2012. I hate this game. It sucks. And I suck at it. I had rated this a 7 when I first got into the hobby, thinking it to be an ok filler or introduction game. But now revisiting it for the first time in 5 years, it really grates. The luck is unbearable and the decisions are minimal: draw a tile or call an auction.

I still love Ra and wouldn't ever turn down a game, but I'm limiting my 10's and have been thinking of downgrading Ra for a while.  Still a wonderful game, and not as appreciated as it should be, though it's quite popular.

This is a great game.  Perfect blend of analysis & risk-taking/push-your-luck.  A wonderful blend of certainty and uncertainty, with the ability to manipulate your opponents.

I'm not keen on auction games, but this is one of the first of that genre that I found enjoyable.  The very strict bidding limitations, the various ways of scoring, and the strategy of when to call "Ra", all combine into a rather intricate, yet quite manageable, web of possibilities.

It works good for two, and has a nice press-your-luck element, thanks to the random Ra tiles.  This one seems deep, but is on the light side, thanks to the randomness of the draw.  You basically have one kind of decision to make, but mulling over when to grab and when to let it ride is quite fun and tense.  Definitely deserving of its reputation, and I can see why this fit into the Alea big box series quite well (although we have the recent RG reprint, sans numeral, sadly).  As the only other evaluation game we'd really played was Medici vs. Strozzi (also a Knizia, and a game that plays like a bag full of ball bearings... to the face), this has redeemed the concept for us.  Good, solid stuff.

I really like d the interesting mechanics in this game, but it was ruined for my group by the description on the box. 

A couple people just could not stop making fun of the '10' rating that the game gives itself on the back of the box. Now nobody wants to play 'cause they only associate it with the stupid self-lauding box, rather than what a neat game it was. :P

Example:

"You guys want to play Ra?"

Sarcastic: "Yeah! That game is a TEN!"

Currently my favorite Knizia game. I'm not sure how the game will age with me though. I suspect that it won't be long before I don't have much more strategic/tactical exploration left with the game. But this might be offset by the fact that it's an auction game, so playing the opponents (not just the game) properly should continue to provide fresh experiences.

5/7/15 - Lowering to a 6. This game just isn't seeing the table anymore.

Fabulous bidding game. The currency is not convertible, and each lot is of different value to each person. I love that you are also bidding for currency. Easy to teach despite all of the different tiles. Push your luck. Plus you get to shout "RA!"  The problem is that it can be dependent on the luck of the draw when only one person is left bidding.  But players should be taking that opportunity into consideration, so it fits right into the game.

Honestly, not sure what the fuss is all about.  Three playings in a row didn't inspire me to love the game, but I never like learning games when the game is mostly auctions.  Will try again, hopefully, before I die.

Update:  Re-evaluation upon a subsequent play.  Understanding the "Invoke Ra" action is paramount to understanding the strategy of the game.  Loved it, and will make it the next game that hits the table.  Rating up.

Update II:  Have taught my daughters (10- and 8-year-olds) to play.  All liked it, had fun, they did OK.

Ra sat on a shelf for years, untouched, and now it is has come to enjoy a rebirth.  Good news for other untouched games.

For all the raves Ra gets around here, once I finally got to play, I was a bit disappointed. The auction bidding system is very straightforward, in fact a bit too straightforward for my taste. The theme didn't connect for me at all, either. Bidding and auctions don't make me think about ancient Egypt, and thinking about ancient Egypt never brings auctions or set collection to mind.

Played with three. The first time, we forgot to invoke automatic auctions, so the game was really boring. The second time, auctions were fast and furious, and the game improved. But the scoring system was still confusing as hell, and nobody could strategize effectively. My brother HATES this game. Need to try again. UPDATE: I still am not sold on this game. But I also think we keep playing it wrong, not rules-wise, but strategy-wise.

This is a true Knizia masterpiece. Plays in about 20 minutes for us, and there's always something to react to. It's pretty funny when a tile comes out that you REALLY NEED BAD!! and you look down at your auction suns... and your highest number is a mediocre 7. Can you win the auction? Yes, you can... and that's what makes this game so exciting.

Another alea game that started out seeming pretty good but ended up as a true classic. Has that combination of fairly simple rules and straightforward gameplay that masks a great deal of subtlety. Any designer but Knizia, and it would probably turn out that there was a single strategy that was stronger than the rest, but with Knizia you can count on incredibly fine balance. Great game with huge replay value. I believe this is the ultimate auction game.

My only compaint about Ra is that I think the luck of the draw gets a touch out of control with 5 players (with 5 players, it probably rates an 8 instead of a 10). I would generally prefer fewer players, and with 3 players, I think Ra is utterly brilliant.

I mostly respect this for it's "gateway" factor.  I prefer the purity of Medici for an auction game.  I still feel like this is solvable, and I have to stop myself from trying each game.

Nice auction game. However when it comes to games which are mainly about that, I prefer the more lively and more FUN Kuhandel. Still, it's a fine game for what it is and we often find ourselves taking this one from the shelves. Not long and plenty of stuff to enjoy.

12 Jan 05: I've now finally had a chance to play Traumfabrik - one of Knizia's other auction games. I have to say I find the Hollywood them a lot more fun, less abstract and the game's more family-friendly. That said, Ra's sun dial track adds an interesting twist. Both are good, but of the two I prefer Traumfabrik.

Pity I haven't yet had a chance to play Modern Art or Medici... :(

RATING: 7
The Shut Up & Sit Down video review made this sound interesting, but I wasn't sure if this would be too heavy for the group. For Sale seemed about right.

This was $60 at Dice House Games. I like the idea of the game, but that was too much for me. We already had the new version of Modern Art, so that seemed excessive. I found a used copy of the Dutch version (that has wooden sun tokens!) and ended up buying that. I need to create English cheat sheets for this game.

We had two bad plays, where I was trying to figure out the rules on my phone while I was trying to teach using the hints in Dutch on the board. It didn't work. After I made notes, though, teaching the game was relatively easy, and everyone understood the game rather quickly.

I like the bidding, and how the tile that you bid can be won by someone else later in the game. I also like that the bids are constrained to the three or four sun tokens that you have.

The game plays really differently at 3p vs. 4p. I didn't adjust my bidding for the 4p game, and I was out relatively early, without enough points. I haven't played a 5p game yet.

One of the most elegant games ever designed. Normally I dislike once-around bidding, but it just works so incredibly well in this game. Ra is chock full of agonizing, tough decisions. The bidding sun mechanism is fantastic; it adds more depth to the game and gives it exactly the right amount of strategy. The scoring might be a little overwhelming at first but it quickly becomes second nature. A fantastic game.

Edit: You know, this game has REALLY stood the test of time for me. It was one of my first gaming loves and is one of the few games I'm just as excited to play almost a decade later. It is more interactive than most auction games, as each decision you make requires you to consider what everyone else has and is likely to do. It moves at a great pace and is SUCH a meaty game for the 45 minutes it takes, without ever being overwhelming. This earned its 10 long, long ago.

RATING: 7.5
As a fan of games that involve constant valuation and pushing your luck, this one holds a special place in my heart; I have yet to play another auction game that encapsulates those two aspects in such a pure and elegant way.  The various ways in which different sets of tiles are scored keep the valuations interesting, but this does mean that the game can feel very mathematical at times (as do many of Dr. Knizia's other games).  The unpredictable length of each epoch, determined by the Ra track, underlies the push-your-luck aspect of the game.  Of course, planning ahead to acquire the sun tiles one needs for subsequent epochs is another strategic consideration.  The Egyptian theme is irrelevant, but it does provide the context for the nice art on the components and the Ra figure.  Deservedly one of the classic Euro auction games.

For the playing time, can't get any better. I love games that force you to think offensively and defensively on every turn, and the gambling element always keeps things fresh. 

Knizia is amazing about giving you a very limited decision (pull tile, play god, call Ra) and creating agonizing tension and huge depth and replayability. If someone who never played a Knizia were to ask me for a recommendation that gave them a good idea of everything he was about, Ra would probably get the nod.

RATING: 9.25
Fantastic auction game! Every gamer needs to own an auction game, and this one is a pretty neat one - currently it's my favorite auction game because it's so easy to teach and learn, yet it's certainly NOT easy to actually win and there are many paths to victory... It's hands down one of the most elegant designs I've ever come across. Few rules + tough decisions = winning combination!

I think it's a cool mechanic that you have to estimate the value of the different tiles to you and your opponents - and this estimation changes with every single tile drawn! And even though you don't want to win an auction, it might be good to invoke Ra anyway just to avoid other players getting too many tiles. This is especially true when you have low suns, which are actually quite good even though new players seem to overlook this fact. After a couple of plays they start to be much more aggressive with their lower suns and invoke RA a lot more. Players with the highest suns sometimes seem to be too greedy because they know they can get all of the tiles, but that might actually be a disadvantage if the other players play smartly and constantly invoke RA!
I even won a 3p game once with 73 points even though I had suns 2, 3, 4 and 5 (!!!) in the second era!

There are tons of ways to score points, and there is obviously no winning strategy. You can go for nile tiles, but if you never get a flood you're screwed. But it's all about taking (calculated) chances and evaluating the risks. Sure, you can be unlucky and draw some tiles which doesn't do anything for you but help your opponent, or you can draw a disaster tile when you were considering to invoke Ra instead, making the tiles for auction less desirable. But it's all about estimating the values of the current tiles (only the monuments you need to "plan" a little ahead for). 

I've seen and heard some describe Ra as a "luck fest" - and in all honesty it couldn't be further from the truth! Yes, it’s not chess; I admit that there is some luck when you’re drawing the tile, but it isn’t that crucial – because it’s only one tile, and then you need to evaluate the new situation. And also because the tile you have drawn is not added to your own player board or something like that as in other games, but it’s added to the center tableau where everybody can win it… So the luck is actually not that significant, and that’s why some people seem to consistently win this game, which they wouldn’t ever do if it had as much luck as some claim...

Oh, and just a tip; don't ever let a player sit back with two bids while everybody else has used their suns if there are 3-4 open Ra spaces left (I've seen it a couple of times); unless this player is unlucky, he can draw and get at least 8 tiles before the era is over. Speaking of this, I absolutely love the tension of the Ra tiles as you never know when the era/epoch is going to end! I've seen people win and lose because of 4 Ra tiles being pulled from the bag in a row, but it's not too common. The tension is delightful!

Finally, Ra plays very across all player counts, even with 2 (!), and it plays in less than an hour (around half an hour with 3 players or so, and it works surprisingly well with 2 players for an auction game), so I think Ra deserves its high rating!

Of the games I love, it is especially difficult for me to explain my enjoyment of this one.  It doesn't have the streamlined elegance of a Sackson game, nor of Dorra's best.  And you'd think that the multitude of scoring mechanisms would be clunky.  But this game hums along at a brisk, easy pace, filled with engaging tension.  The sun-bidding mechanism is the game's most elegant feature.  The tempo is fun; draw a tile, and pass the bag.  The push-your-luck element of each round prompts head slaps and loud groans, while the luck element never feels too great.  The game isn't simple, but it nevertheless plays very simply and fascinatingly.

RATING: 10
Ra is the first game (along with Metropolys!) I rated a 10. I love auction games, and for me, Ra is the definitive auction game. It's not "a game with an auction round," the auction is the game, and Ra produces brinksmanship and interaction more than most other auction games.

There's three things that make Ra work incredibly well. You're not bidding money. Instead, you have three or four "suns" of different value, so you are limited in your bids. None of this bid around the table "twelve... thirteen... fourteen... um... fifteen. Sixteen? Sixteen." A bid in Ra is once around the table, and you better make it count.

The other thing about Ra is that, as players collect all the different range of tiles, players end up viewing the value of the tile set up for auction much differently. Some tiles relatively useless to one player are crucial to another. This produces lively auctions and table talk. 

...and lastly, each one of the three rounds ends when X number of Ra tiles are drawn, which creates a "game clock" that winds down at different paces. The result is a press-your-luck ending and pressure for those players with remaining bids.

My only possible knock on Ra is that it's relatively themeless. The Egyptian theme has little to do with the mechanics, but it adds an aura of "classiness." Given that this fantastic game wraps up in 45 minutes or less, I expect I'll be playing this one for as long as I play Euro games.

Before trying it I wasn't sure I'd like a pure auction game.  But it's a brilliant game hung on a single idea -- that the relative value of different goods changes constantly based on external circumstances.  Best middleweight game I own.

We have the new Uberplay version, which is very attractive.  We play 2-player with the variant explained in the game's variant folder here, which works very well.  We've also played a couple times with 4, and love it either way.  Each type of tile is scored differently and at different times, which greatly affects the value each set of tiles holds for each player.  The scoring key, which is printed on the board, is very helpful.

This is a good, well-balanced auctioning game with a good amount of luck and strategy. I even like way the number tiles are used for the auctions and change after winning an auction. I'm not exactly sure what the Egyptian theme has to do with the game, but the art is elegant and functional.  I was very surprised with the host told me it was released in 1999.

Very good game, though it can feel a bit redundant at times. I taught this to my wife's family, who play games like Yahtzee! and Mexican Train Dominoes, and they picked it up quickly and enjoyed it very much. My 13 year old niece beat me after only a few plays under her belt and she even asked to play it again the next day (yeah!).

The more I play this game, the more I like it.  Helps when you actually play it correctly!  My past errors included playing God tiles when you had no suns left and only applying disasters to the tiles in your area rather than those in your area and on the board.  It is somewhat prone to some weird sequences of tiles, but that's part of the fun.  I would say it takes 5 or more plays before you start making good valuations for tile sequences.  I favor the three player game slightly.  Tends to favor monuments a little more than the four or five player games.  However, I've won a few three player games with only one or two monuments, so you never know.

An undeniably clever game for how simple it is, but doesn't work for me at all. Your actions are frustratingly limited (basically either add to the current items for auctioning, or start a once round the table bid - that's it. I think even poker gives you more wiggle room than this), and the scoring system seems complex just for the sake of it.

This is clearly a very good game that is clearly too light for me.  I have often read Knizia receive the backhanded compliment that he designs very good scoring systems, and this game is an excellent example.  Every little bit of the game is well-crafted, clever, and appealing, but when you add it all up, it's a game about pulling tiles out of a bag and juggling small numbers in your head for an hour.  Whee!

This game combines an auction mechanic, set collection, and press-your-luck.  It's worth noting that it's not a typical auction.  You will have three different values you can bid which could be something like 1, 9, and 13 or 3, 5, and 12.  You can only bid these specific amounts, which can make the auctions interesting.
The game plays fast.  Even with 5 players, it won't last an hour once you are familiar with the rules.  Perfect game for those nights that finish too early to start playing filler, but you don't have the time to start a new 2 hour game.

The use of the sun markers for the auction creates a very novel feel to the bidding in this game. The fact that you also inherit the current chip is an interesting twist. I also like the superfluous substantial wooden components.

But the part that makes this game genius is the economy of the Ra tiles as you go from epoch to epoch. The relative scarcity of 'good tiles' dwindles and the tension grows and grows. In the end it can get very exciting.

Best. Auction game. Ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is very solid, the different scoring mechanisms mesh well and offer the kind of variety necessary to keep my interest with a nice balance between short term profit and long term investments. The auction 'sun' mechanic is also innovative as it allows one to cash in low suns for future rounds, or to screw the opposition and force them to 'overpay' for smaller lots with a lucrative tile or two in them. It's a rare auction game that scales down well to 3 players, and this manages to do that, and also to have a workable 2 player variation as well. Only weighs in at medium, but it's hard to find a better game at that weight that plays in only an hour. This is all about timing: when to invoke Ra, when to keep drawing, how much to pay for a given lot, I admire how everything meshes together. 

I used to dither back and forth about whether I liked this or Modern Art more, and MA is currently in the lead simply because I've mildly burned out on Ra. For virgins, this is the one you should pick up if you like pushing your luck and number crunching, and is probably a little less susceptible to newbie game weirdness. I think that it lacks the psychology and interesting hand management aspects of Modern Art, but it largely makes up for it with the wild and wooly fun of the tile draw, especially because of the disaster tiles and the way they impact the value of auctions...not to mention the always present threat that the round will end before you want it to!

This is a very solid title, and is highly recommended to any gamer who likes pure auction games.

For me, this is the opposite of a game like Vikings.  This is a game that I don't have a knack for.  I get stomped every time I play, but I seem to have a bit of an appetite for destruction.

This is probably the best auction-based game that I've played, and the variety of scoring mechanisms presents several strategies and keeps the suspense up until the end (except in the one game where one guy had like 52 monuments).

One of Knizia's better designs.  I generally despise auction games but this one is unique enough and interesting enough to warrant dragging out a few times a year.  I think the decision level is just right as well as the playtime and there's some real fun to it despite a fairly dry, dull look and theme.  The scoring is a little too clever for its own good, but in all this is a deserved classic that shouldn't be overlooked in favor of the tremendous glut of sub-par Knizia games that seem to be de rigeur these days.

How did this become the #10 game?  It was fun, and a nice auction game, but the theme was thin, and it didn't feel like there was a lot there.  My score will probably go up with more games.  I like Tigris/Euphrates a lot more.  An interesting game (RA) but not that "fun" although I played it twice tonight (12/29) with some fun, trash talking friends.

Update: played it again with experienced gamers.  I made one good play and happened to win.  Ho hum.

RA is an auction game with an Egyptian theme that never gets played twice. It takes a few games to nail down the scoring, but after that, the game operates simply, quickly and smoothly. The problem is that the bag is too small for the tiles, and the game is also a bit too random.

Feels like a classic. [-]I'm terrible at auction games as I never realise what's valuable to me, but out of all of them I enjoy this the most and happy to keep playing even though I always lose! Perhaps I'm hoping I'll get better at it one day...[/-]

Time to update this, as I quite often do win now or come close. I still love this and like it more and more every time I play. It might even make a 10 one day. The only niggle is whether the strategies are too limited and linear, but it doesn't really factor all that much, because the main thrust of the game (and I guess the main reason why it might put people off) is the constant evaluating of your and your opponents' hand, and the relative value of the tiles available. I love that tension. The feeling of calling Ra or bidding out of place just so you force an oponent into a decisiosn they really didn't want to make is delicious.

I'm still terrible at open bidding but closed economies like this suit me fine, as it's much easier to focus on value. Plus the set collection aspect appeals, and it's very easy to teach.

Updated after 2nd game.
People said it takes a few games to get this one. 5 players was MUCH better than 3. Having a clue as to what the strategies can be made it better. I won with monuments (having gone down to 8 points total from the first 2 scoring rounds.) 


First rating after one 3 player game: 4
First comment: Not my kind of game. In an auction you should be able to have some level of reliable information about the worth of what you are bidding for. I did quite well despite having no clue what I was doing and making at least one major error in strategy.
I would rether play Medici or Modern Art.

Rule Screw Up: When we first played this game we didn't read the rule that if everyone passed the tiles were removed from play, so we were getting massive hauls because we wouldn't take it until the track was full...  yeah that makes a HUGE difference.

Ra! 

While I don't like `once around' auctions, the sun tile mechanic saves it a little. This game would be better if the choices were difficult. The question is always ``should I call Ra.'' The answer is seldom unclear.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ra is a bit of a pendulum in terms of my appreciation for it. At first I found it cool, then I went through a phase of 'average', and now its star is slowly rising again. But I'll add a very important 'but' here: you should always play with people who know what they are doing, and know the basic strategies. Then, and [i]only[/i] then, does the game stand a chance of showing what it's capable of. In other words: don't take games with newcomers too seriously until they've grown a decent feel of how the game works. (I should probably be more lenient with other games where this is a factor, too.)

Ra is a auction game with very clean and lean mechanics, and thus allows the players to fight it out amongst themselves. The scoring is typical of Knizia: convoluted like hell, and thus a source of confusion for the newbies. You must correctly assess what is on display to be able to decide what to do. Subject-wise, this game is pointless, but it provides for a nice background which still seems to work. Presentation-wise, I prefer the BSW-interface as it's clearer what other players have amassed so far. There is no genuine turn angst save in a few special cases: the decision space is rather limited, after all, and in most cases, easily collapses into a single decision. But don't let this fool you: playing this game well depends on a lot of exceedingly subtle factors, and mastering those will keep you busy for quite a while. The fact that the original alea- and 999 Games-editions function exceedingly well with a 2 player-variant which now has been promoted to an official ruleset should increase the amount of table time in any household.

Really love this game.  There are better bidding games, but it is so much fun to push your luck, or to jump in at just the right time to make everyone groan as they have to make a decision that they didn't want to... or pick up a 2 with the 15 when they really wanted one more tile.

Part of my enthusiasm for this game - besides it's excellent gameplay - may be from the fact my partner Barb likes, okay tolerates it.  Introduced it to some newby gamers recently.

Ra was one of those earlier euro style games that have stood the test of time.  I own the 1999 release which is slightly different from the newer itteration of the game.  This is a game of press your luck.  Each player is trying to accumulate various tiles that score points on each of the three major rounds.  Most of the tiles go away with the ravages of time other than monument tiles and a few other types of tiles.  The cool part of the game is the bidding mechanism.  Greed is also strong in this game as players jockey for wanting more and more useful tiles before declaring RA.  But look out, the round may end prematurely if the wrong tiles are pulled randomly out of the bag potentially leaving players with unused bidding tiles at the end of a round.  This game is a lot of fun and has good replayability.  It is not deep, but also plays well with the Egyptian theme per the game title for design.  This was one of my first euro games collected and it gets played two or three times a year even now in 2013.  Ra has made my top 50 list of euro style games of all time.

Wow, Asmodee, $59.99 MSRP and with their enforced  price floor?. 
Was $40 MSRP back in the day, now with very cheap components $59.99 aka $60.00?  Unbelievable...

They seem to just jack up prices to get they max off to hit near what the MSRP should be.  If I am remembering correctly, their price floor would put a hard limit of a sale price of $48.00 on this game. This is the absolute lowest price with a price floor of 20 percent. So Admodee's MSRP on the box = (what should be the real MSRP) plus 20 percent? Google "floor price". It basically a business model that ops to ignore supply and demand, setting a price point that is higher then where the two variables meet. It opts to lost sales, making up the lost via of lower units sold but at higher prices. Floor Pricing forces buyers out of the market. 

Not worth $35 tops to buy, for what you get in the box. Look at the components vs the older versions.. Factor in this game play isn't earth shattering. 

Will never buy any game that goes thru their distribution since they all get hit with that price floor. Price floor? This is got to hurt small shops that stock their games, and they can't clearance them off the selves when the desire wanes? My opinion, it hurts everyone except high volume online retailers. This will force out lower volume retailers. 

At the end of the day this is just a board game and no way would I get $59.99 worth of pleasure out of this thing, in fact, it would piss me off at the thought of paying that for this. Just so many more better games out there to spend $60.00 bucks on then this. Yeah, I now rate games based on price vs what I get out of it. 

Got rid of my original copy of the original game, payed something like $25 dollars for it. Sold it for $20.00. For the game play, about what it was worth.

If this  hobby keeps going into the deep $60.00 plus, going to just take up golf instead... it would be cheaper.

This twist on a standard auction game limits players to only three successful bids each round.  And in return you get the bidding tile that was used to win the prior auction.  Players work to collect tiles in various areas, struggling not to be the lowest in a few of them.

On the one hand I appreciate the unique bidding mechanism, and that sometimes the auctions are dangerous to win because of disasters.  What isn't apparent to me just yet is how players can stay out of the hole when they do poorly early in the game.  A few -5 penalties are devastating if you just couldn't win the right tiles.

I'm curious, but not fully convinced this game is as great as I've heard.  Modern Art remains the superior auction game for me.

Components: Sturdy, functional components, with great wooden sun tokens. I'm still having trouble differentiating between the different monuments. The Uberplay edition has red x's on the tiles that I keep; the x's should be on the tiles that I throw away each round; makes it very confusing to explain to players each turn.

Experience: The auction works very well, with each lot having advantages and disadvantages for each player. I am particularly impressed by the mechanism of swapping out sun tokens. There is great tension as players budget their tokens, often calling Ra on small sets, trying to get bargains rather than letting the player with the highest valued sun token just build up a monster lot.

I'm always very unsure what to make of Reiner Knizia, he has designed some good games, but many (often highly regarded by others) I just don't like. Maybe it is his penchant for auction games, which are not my favourite things. In this case the system where you can only win a set number of auctions and everyone knows what the others can bid is brilliant and because of that I think it's his best game, the only one of his that I can't envisage turning down a game of.

One problem with many auction games is figuring out the "true" value of what you are buying.  That problem is not a problem in Ra.  You don't have much choice in what to bid, and different sets are worth different amounts at different times to different players.  Superb game, probably the best of Knizia's auction games.

Really didn't enjoy this with two, but had much more fun with four.  With more people, you get more auctions, more action, and you have people aiming for different objectives, often at cross purposes.

The best auction game. By reducing the amount of information a player needs to process during a bidding round, making the value of what's being bid on variable or risky to varying degrees, and limiting the amount one can bid, the game avoids nearly all the pitfalls of other auction games (brinksmanship, snowballing wealth) and injects tension into every decision. It's also the perfect length.

A beautiful auction mechanic, making for quick auctions where the 'currency' you bid with is almost self-correcting (those with horrible numbers can bid purely to get a slightly-better number).

Set collection seems well balanced.

Game contains fun moments: great to watch Mark drawing tiles when the last player in, gambling on getting a great 'collection' before the round-ending tile arrises.

Plays fast, simple with interesting choices. Light but fun.

Best auction game ever and an all-time favorite.  Each player only has three purchases of bids in each of three epochs, so you have to make sure you get the most bang for your egyptobucks, while making sure your opponents pay through the nose. There's lots of playing chicken as well, trying to force the price up without getting stuck with something you don't want. The best part of it is how each set of tiles up for bid is worth a different amount to each player, so you need to be aware of your opponent's tiles at all time. Fantastic game.

Tension in that you only get one chance to bid during each auction--there's no "upping" your bid.  Furthermore, there's a push-your-luck element included so players don't hoard their bidding tiles.  Good bit of fun and strategy packed into one hour.  Excellent game that's fun for gamers and non-gamers alike.  

Good game, but the Rio Grande production quality sucks with the cardboard tiles--I prefer the "European" quality of cardboard.  Also, there was no good reason to enlarge the board and pieces, as RGG did.  Get the Uberplay version.

Not a huge fan of pure auction games as most of these games just require a play to be able to properly value items for bid. There doesn't seem to be too much you can do in the way of gamesmanship as you are beholden to dealing with the tile reveal as to whether or not you should start a bid or what to bid if one is started.

If it wasn't for the point salad scoring system this would be awful. The real game here is keeping track of what is going on with your tiles, and what all the other players  are doing. Kind of a weird game really, but strangely appealing.

Many people seem to love this game. That's ok.

For me, the chance factor is too high. The progress of the game essentially revolves around not drawing a Ra token forcing an auction of sometimes a dreadful table of tokens.

Also I find it exceptionally difficult to get interested in the bidding/auction mechanic. My group likes it very much. I agree to play so as to make up numbers and prevent all the other players from getting in last place with my super-human apathy.

Rated after 1 play @ 4

The game never drew me in and wanted me to keep playing. Some parts felt a bit random, others just felt dull. Near the end I was just picking tiles quickly to get things moving and finish up. Would play again with a group but not something I feel compelled to add to my collection or suggest as a game to play.

I find this game really does depend on the group. The second play was way more interesting in terms of when I needed to use my larger bid tiles and trying to make other players over pay. I still think the components of the game are poor and than it takes a lot of effort to remember all the random point combinations for tiles. Streamlining that would make it higher in my book.

Knizia's most accessible pure auction game. Easy analysis of each bid, thanks to the following: bidding currency (almost) different from winning criteria, fixed maximal number of bids, perfectly known bidding strength of each player and once around biddind method. 
On the other hand, the value of each set is quite hard to evaluate properly.

Fast, appealing and really interesting. Worth the hype.

I don't think this is a great game. It is in my opinion a Memory variant, in that remembering exactly what your oponents have and which tiles have been revealed greately influences your ability to exell at this game. In my view less a game of strategy and more one of ability (to remember), definately not my kind of game.

No matter how many times I play this, I am always up for another game.  Also play on BSW.  This is an amazing auction game that always generates a lot of tension and tough decisions.  Relatively easy to learn also.  Perhaps my favorite feature is the sun tiles and how you can force situations to purchase great groups of tiles with lower value suns.  Wish it came with a bag for the tiles.  I prefer 3 player because there is more control, but 4 and 5 can also be very good.

Man, this is a dang fine piece of work.  Pure perfect main mechanic, tons of ways to score, maybe a little off in how one person can finish a round way before anyone else, but that is made up for by the thrill of the final bid holder playing against the clock to steal as much as possible.  How much is a bid worth when you have five scoring oppurtunities, next round's bid, and the sun clock to consider?  Every auction is interesting.

One of the better auction games I've played.  I always want to play this game...even though I rarely win. Good game for newbies that frown upon being at a disadvantage.  A first time player has as good a chance to win as someone who's played 20 times.  I find myself upgrading this from an 8 to a 9.  I have played this excellent game for years and years.  it's easy to teach and is a great game to pull out when you have a group of well-versed gamers.  Almost everyone likes it to some extent and is willing to play.

Ra was another game introduced to me by Eric in one of our weekend get togethers.

I like Ra. Despite my aversion to pure auction games, Ra did it quickly and elegantly enough to make it fun and interesting for me to play. I liked the push your luck aspect of calling Ra, and I liked the fact that you had to weight when, exactly, to use your bidding tiles instead of dealing out money for the auction. The set collection is pretty interesting too.

RATING: 10
Excellent bidding game from Reiner Knizia that seems to produce acute anguish each time it hits the table. Players bid via simple auction mechanics on tiles that are drawn randomly from the bag. At the end of each round victory points are awarded (or lost!) based on your purchases. You are very detached from the theme of ancient Egypt, but who cares when the game play is as good as this. A game I'll always play.

Great auction game that works well with two players. Many things about this game are genius. The game has a lot of depth because each bid/decision has it's pros and cons that must be considered, but it's simple and quick enough that it's not overwhelming. It's not just about deciding what to bid, but also when to start an auction. Plus the blind tile draw allows for some push-your-luck decisions that I love. Passing the draw bag works well to remind players that it's their turn, so the game subtly keeps players focused.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Neat mechanics. I think more plays will increase my rating.

2011/01/04: Better game than I originally thought, though we did not play with the correct rules. I only used 1 god tile in 3 games, because we were drawing tiles first every turn.  Definitely need to play with correct drawing rules, and remembering when the auction row is full, the forced Ra does not have to be purchased.

2011/01/24: Mary killed us with monuments. Aaron barely scored the entire game.  Game still feels like it moves too quickly. We might play again and remove some Ra tiles.

2011/02/01: Realising that the last Ra tile drawn in each epoch does not trigger an auction changes the 'push-your-luck' aspect of this to an acceptable level. I'm raising the rating to 8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
There is a lot of room for skillful play in the chaos of the draw. Essentially the game gives out victory points for poker hands... but the cards needed to build your poker hands are auctioned off in lots. Fun, convoluted combos make each player ask themselves 'How much are these tiles worth to ME?' The press-your-luck element is another clever addition, as players keep adding more tiles to the auctions. Genius.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Salvaged the wooden betting tiles from a cheap copy of the slightly inferior priests of ra, their addition improves this already gorgeous edition. This is an amazing game, being both simple and quite deep. It's an auction game that I imagine people who don't like auction games can get behind. It's fast, and quite addictive. I play the app often, and could almost imagine playing this in a casino. Its also very good with two, which is unusual for an auction game. It's my favourite of the Knizia auction games. Medici is simpler and more pure, modern art eclipses both, but only with the right crowd, this is the smartest and sleakest of the bunch. I like the Egyptian themeing, the new tiles look fab ( though I can imagine legibility issues may have been raised). I see myself as being  more of an Ameritrash gamer really, but these older games, euros before that name existed are where it's at really.

After some more plays, I'm bumping this one to a 10!  Ra is an outstanding game, and my favorite Knizia auction.  I really enjoy the bidding for lots mechanism, as it means you're never bidding on quite the same thing from game to game.  I love the amount of control you can wield over the other players through strategic calling of Ra and well placed bids (Ra would be an excellent tutorial on the importance of position for poker players).  You are definitely directly challenging your opponents, and yet because of the bidding mechanism, it doesn't feel as confrontational as it is (people feel as though they've screwed themselves when you manage to back them into a corner).  The game is very quick for one with so much open information.  Ra's surprisingly good with 2 players using the variant posted here.

THE SPARK: No other game I have played lets you force tough decisions on your opponents like this one.  It is delicious

UPDATE Sept2012: Played this again after a long respite.  The shine has not diminished one bit.  10!!!

I'm not a huge fan of the limited number of options available on your turn.  It only occasionally makes sense to invoke Ra and God tiles are scarce, so drawing a tile from the bag is usually your default option.

Easily one of my favorite games, and a prime example of why I respect Knizia so much.

Set collection done right: the different sets are very distinct from one another, and play out in interesting ways as the rounds proceed.

Auctioning done extremely right: This is, by a long shot, the absolute best auctioning mechanic I've seen. Three values you can use to bid with, replacing it with the 'spare' value each time. It's quicker than rounds of +1 and way more interesting.

Using this stunning auction mechanism to obtain fascinating sets? My word, have you got me sold.

UPDATE: I really do love this game. This game has earned it's way up to a "10" for me after many, many plays. An extremely clever game that I never get tired of. 

I first played this with my wife a few times using a 2-player variant and I was a little disappointed. We would blurt out "RA" when we would invoke "it" which was funny. But after playing it once with 4 players, I really enjoyed it. I love the "press your luck" factor in this game. The best scenario is when you're the only player with any suns left and you press your luck against the Ra tiles.

Although the theme is about as tacked on as it can get, Ra has quickly become my favorite auction game.  It has tons of tough decisions to make throughout.  Best of all, it plays easily in under an hour, so even your worst game of it won't take all day to play.

Blech.  Ra is a popular game, but I can't see why.  It's an auction game without the auction.  Most of the decisions are pretty brain-dead, as there's always one person at the table who has the highest single number, and they get final say if the lot is something they want.  Now, they do have to decide if it's worth it, and the fact that you're swapping suns means you have to consider whether you want that new number next turn.  But, in general, the game is super random and irritates me no end.

If you're the last one in, you can go one-on-one with the tile bag, and potentially get a huge haul with just one sun.  But this just turns it into a push-your-luck exercise where the rest of the table gets to watch helplessly.  And the rest of the rounds can degenerate into maneuvering to be the player in this position.  A large chunk of it seems to be calling auctions on marginal lots to try and drive out the other players.

Ra is great. There's a little more to explain than other Knizia auction games, so I've had a harder time getting it to the table.

While the limited sun tokens make bidding a fun puzzle to solve, they reduce your ability to make more arbitrary valuations compared to something like Medici. I like Medici's bidding a little better because you're bidding with victory points, too.

●Introduced and owned by a friend (many thanks!!).
●My 1st auction/bidding game, also my 1st Reiner Knizia game.
●Played 3 times in the same evening, but still couldn't properly get the strategy behind this game, thus not sure on the status.Demand a few more plays before deciding.
●Have kind of a mixed bag about this game.
●Comment Update: I realized that I'm not a fan of the artwork and gameplay, so I though that I don't have to wait for a 2nd play to announce that.

The more I play Ra, the more I appreciate this game. I find that with 5 players you got less control on the game. Ra really shines with 3 players. The value of the different tiles varies in game depending the number of players in my opinion. So how you view the values of your Suns varies.

This is the type of game I play which is a filler for us. Something we play late at night as a last game. Something that isn't too short or doesn't take forever to play a game.

Traded Ra in a game trade.

Bought Ra for the second time.

Tried Priests of Ra. Prefer the original. Won`t buy the newer version.

*UPDATE*

Still enjoy this game more than ever. Now we play RA as a filler! Rating up from a 9.25 to a 9.75

I think that this is perhaps the perfect auction game: easy to explain, looks great, and always keeps you guessing. I like the fact that you have limited amounts to bid -- this makes the game run faster than a typical auction game in my opinion and makes for some interesting tactical decisions.

This is a great auction game that's very easy to set up, teach and play.  The scoring takes newbies a little getting used to however.  If you print out a player mat with the scoring rules on the mat, it makes things much easier.  Ra makes me want to try the other Knizia auction games.  I think the best mechanism in Ra, is that the person that initiates the once-around auction is the last person to make a bid and if nobody else bids you have to take the item.  I never thought I would like a game that just revolves around bidding after having played Fist of Dragonstones but Ra is so elegant in what it does that that I can't see anyone disliking it.  No one that I've introduced it to has disliked it.

Do not dismiss this as a simple bidding game. It is very unique. If you win the bid, you win the previous bidding marker, and your bidding marker gets added to the items for the next auction. You are trying to collect various items that score in all sorts of ways (sets, most of, most different, etc). There is also an unknown amount of time to get what you want. If you are too greedy, you might get burned.

This game is a lot of fun. Print off the player sheets before you play this one, I don't think that the Uberplay version would be too good without them. 

8 to 9. This game is really interesting. Have played (not logged) more BSW plays than I have real plays. There's a lot going on in this game and the more I play it, the more I like it. With the tile draw, there's a substantial luck aspect that gives the game its legs. You definitely need luck on your side to be in contention, but skill is what will put a player over the top.  

Many plays on BSW not logged. (25-30)

9 to 7. It's still a really interesting game, but after about 30 BSW plays I feel that the game has a little too much luck involved. Too many times I have been out of the game after the first round based on the assigned tiles and how the auctions proceed. It's still an amazing auction game, but a lot of the magic is gone for me. 

I really hate how this game can just hand over the victory to a player sometimes. Sure, he or she can really get themselves in a good position with a well-placed bid but I feel like this game can really hose a player. That being said, I still want to play all the time. 

7 back to 9. Won 3 of 4 on BSW the other day (when up to that I was probably taking last quite a few times) the game just clicked in my head and I have that newfound love for it again.

I can't really say this is a bad game - it seems well designed, but I don't really enjoy it.  I guess the auction mechanic, void of any sort of on-board play, just isn't very interesting to me.  Also, while it does have a lot of skill, there are a couple places where the luck is frustratingly prominent (such as when playing chicken), making it feel too chaotic for my taste.  I liked Amun Re much better.

A deep and challenging game. The auction mechanism creates a very tense atmosphere and players can really get into the theme, with players shouting RA! RA! RA! Downsides: The theme is not as rich as Amun-Re and in terms of the auction mechanism, Modern Art pips this for me with its variety of auctioning mechanisms. 
Update: I still prefer the thematic richness of Amun-Re but the smooth gameplay and easy-to-grasp mechanics of Ra just brings it to the table more often.

[4 plays] I really liked this game right away.  I've tried to figure out why Ra appeals to me so much more than other auction games, and I think it's because it doesn't use money.  With the suns, you only have a few options in any given auction; in the context of the game, that can still be quite complex, but it's much less fiddly and avoids the tedium of racking your brain to decide if you should bid a dollar more.  RA!

Ideal para jugar con cualquier persona, incluso los apenas iniciados disfrutarán de un juego divertivo.
Es sencillo y sobretodo rápido que para grandes veladas o para jugar con no-expertos es fundamental.
Os aconsejo que provéis primero el Razzia, que es prácticamente igual y mucho más barato; si os gusta podréis pillaros el RA que es con tablero y fichas más chulas pero la mecánica del juego es la misma.
Es importante intentar no recibir penalizaciones y los monumentos pueden darte muchos puntos al final.
PARTIDAS:
19-04-2008 5 Jugadores (Richi, Charlie "salinas", Jorge, Pi y Gato). Charlie y Pi inician la partida tomando ventaja gracias a gemas, inundaciones, actividades y dioses(es decir, inversión temporal) Richi empeiza muy mal con -2 en la primera ronda y Jorge y yo empezamos a diversificar las inversiones y somos los que más faraones tenemos. En la segunda ronda, Pilar y Charlie repiten su jugadas, Richi puntua -5 y Jorge se refuerza pero no se lleva los faraones, que son para mi (Gato), que ademas tengo unos cuantos monumentos y muchos ríos(6). En la fase final yo me consolido en los faraones y ríos y Richi a bvase de monumentos saca 28 puntos (sus totales) en una sola ronda.

This is a brilliant game which I'm sure will see plenty of play with my groups. It's so easy to pull out and get going, and it's short enough to play multiple times in a session. It's super easy to explain and for people to pick up, yet there's more to it than a simpler set collection game like Sushi Go. I love the subtle head games you get into with your opponents, yet you're rooting for the same thing a lot of the time. It's all about carefully timing your tactical use of auction calling in order to get the most out of the situation or give your opponents the least. I like the level of player interaction in the game as well. 

You can get into a situation where there's a lot of Ra tiles being drawn, basically one after another, but at least that's often unhelpful for everyone instead of just 1 person getting screwed. I've also noticed that scores can vary pretty wildly between players. I also replaced the included bag with a larger bag which I think is more appropriately sized for the large number of tiles in the game.

I purchased the old Alea edition because I was concerned about readability of the current edition's tiles. I also prefer the wood components to the current edition's cardboard & plastic. I do wish there was a middle ground edition, between utilitarian readability and beautiful design. For the $35 that I payed second-hand, I feel like I got a great deal, but I do think the MSRP of the current edition is too high for a game like this. That plus the design decisions which increased demand for the older editions is inflating the second-hand value of the more reasonably priced previous editions. I can't really fault the game or the designer for that though.

Love it.  My favourite auction game.  

Your first one or two of plays of this are probably not going to be great fun, until you have more of a feeling of the potential value of the sets on the block.  Probably my favourite Knizia game.  From a very limited choice of actions (being pretty much [draw tile | call auction] or [raise bid | leave auction]), come a large set of interesting decisions.  

Also, nice components with good art.  Portable, particularly if you don't care about the board.  

I recommend printing off a player mat for each player from BGG, to give newbies an aid in visualising what it is they're collecting and what might come out.

I've come to realize that while I like auctions as  a mechanism, I don't like pure auction games. Knizia's other auction masterpiece, Medici, already came and went with me.

A wonderful bidding game in which the decision is not as much "how much should I bid?" as "when should I initiate an auction?"  It frustrates some people, but the best players win a remarkable percentage of their games.

Ra is an auction game with some twists.  I usually don't enjoy auction games much, but this one works for me.  It has a unique "opportunity cost" mechanism and a "push your luck" aspect which rises it above the general monotony of auction games to make it more thrilling.  You bid on a whole row of tiles (which may contain negative tiles that destroy part of your tableau). On your turn, you can play a tile to the auction row, snipe a tile from the auction with a "God tile," or shout "Ra!" at the top of your lungs while banging the statue on the table, triggering an auction.

There are 3 epochs, with scoring at the end of each for most types of tiles. You start with three sun tokens of various amounts (no two players have the same sun token amounts) as your money for bidding.  When you win an auction, you exchange your token for the one in the middle (which begins the game as a "1"). The token you take is placed upside down in front of you, and becomes your money to bid in the next epoch. The one you've placed is now up for grabs as part of the auction. 

Meantime, even if nobody is yelling "Ra," tiles with Ra on them appear and are placed on a track, triggering auctions. When the Ra track is full, the epoch is over and nobody gets the tiles currently on the auction track. So if you keep waiting for the auction track to fill, you may lose your chance for any tiles at all. 

To add to the fun, some of the tiles stay in your tableau from epoch to epoch, and some are removed from the game each epoch. As you lose points if you have the least or none of certain disappearing tiles, you have to keep working to get more every epoch (and can't just concentrate on building monuments -- which stay in your tableau and are scored at the end).

If you're an auction fan, you should definitely get this game. And if your friends are NOT, then you should doubly get this game.

A surprisingly tight auction game that I stink at.  The typical "gotta-love-it" Knizia scoring system is what makes the game tense and engaging.  It feels cumbersome with 5, so 3 and 4 players seem to be the sweet spots.

I really like the auction mechanic in this where you bid an amount (sun) and then that gets added to the middle and is part of the next auction. This makes for interesting decisions i.e. I REALLY need that tile but I only have a 13 left to bid with... I don't really want an opponent gaining such a high bidding power.

Push your luck aspect is nice because you could win big or it could bite-you-in-the-ass and you effectively end up a round behind.

Several aspects returning to the box each epoch is interesting as it helps to maintain competition for the tiles throughout the game.

I've cut my rating from 7 to a 3. Yikes! I've got to be honest, I really don't like or get this game. I understand it, but it seems to be a scoring mechanism with a lumpy auction front bolted on. I seem to get stuck with the middling numbers on my Suns, so I can't win Ra bids and I can't parlay a low number into a good result. I've played this a few times to be nice to friends, but no more. Me and Ra are through, I just don't like you.

Fast, fun, and clever!  The RA tiles bring a good level of suspense as they provide a "ticking clock" to suddenly end the round.

One of the classic Knizia games.  Often sighted when describing other games since it had a number of unique features when it came out.  The auction mechanic is so simple one thinks the game plays itself, but since the scoring is where this game sets itself apart, you must make sure you keep an eye on what your opponents are amassing.  Must be played by players of similar experience for the best enjoyment.

Pros
-Fairly streamlined push your luck and set collection game with solid auction mechanics
-As you have only a limited number of bids each round (a total of only 12ish bids in the whole game), each bid requires a lot of thought
-Semi-unpredictable round ends keeps the game tense at all times (will someone outbid me, will this round come to an end before I get something good etc)

Cons
-Game can be frustrating (and possibly punishing) when you predict incorrectly/push your luck too much/get unlucky
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
With more plays (with an AI) I've changed my opinion of the game. Ra's scoring does make sense thematically, and the auctions are quite unique - it's been said they are more like tricks in a trick-taking game.

Duration: This is a medium Euro - fairly quick if players don't ponder too long.
Design: Lots of pieces; you need to understand the scoring before you gain an appreciation of the game. The game scales well over different player counts.
Strategy: There are several different scoring paths that make auction valuation asymmetric.
Components: Decent pieces, tiles, board.
Theme: Egypt isn't my thing but the theme is well integrated into the somewhat artificial foundation.

It seems that this is a game that keeps getting played at my house!  I thought it was frustrating with five players though.  The game looks great on the table and is a blast with three or four players.  This might be my wifes favorite game.  I think the way the tiles come out of the draw bag can make this a fun game or a frustrating one on occasion.  This is my second favorite auction game after Beowulf.

I've played so many games of this now and it just gets better.  It's one of those games I feel has a lot of luck, but just really keeps me interested the whole time.  You can never quite tell what is a good deal and what isn't. The game is as much about manipulating other players by calling Ra at the right time as much as it is what auctions you win.  Brings out a fun push your luck gambling feel that doesn't overstay its welcome.

RATING: 8
[Auction, Egyptian] {3P:9, 4P:7, 5P:5} The premiere pure auction game along with its sibling, Modern Art. The fun factor wears down after a lot of plays, but it's still got enough staying power to hit the table regularly. Part of the appeal is that it plays quickly. Another good thing is that people can yell "RAAAA!!!!" and blow off some stress. *** UPDATE: Still not as good as Modern Art, but still holding up well after many plays. Keeper, but not top shelf. *** UPDATE: You know what? RA is *better* than Modern Art. I doesn't seem to suffer from the 'weak/greedy player syndrome' that plagues Modern Art, and it remains interesting even after a truckload of plays. I underestimated this little gem. Here's hoping that the uberplay reprint pans out, and we can get our grubby gamer hands on a copy of RA that's identical to the alea except for the box! ***UPDATE: The problem with RA is that as the number of players increases, the control decreases substantially because it takes longer before your turn comes back around. In the interim all sorts of things can happen. I'll play with 4 if asked, but 5P is not certain. RA is still all kinds of excellent with 3P though, and it's one of the best games overall with that number of players. *** UPDATE: Acquired the 2005 uberplay reprint through the kindness of Wong Siow Hwee, who grabbed a copy from the FLGS and held it until I could get to Singapore to claim it. Thanks Siow Hwee!

Surprisingly quick and fun (not as complicated as the rulebook made it out to be - the rulebook is awful, by the way). 

*Great* gateway game that is also great for gamers. Just help players understand the scoring system and they will *get* it (and how great the balance of the suns are) by the end of the first epoch. 

Also works well with 2 in my opinion. It's different but it can be quite fun dueling for least and most. 

Theme was definitely pasted on, but it is a Knizia after all.

RATING: 7.5
My rating has gone up some with this game over time. Due to the high level of randomness, some games can be awful -- those stretches where Ra tiles come up like 5 times in 7 tiles or whatever are excruciating -- but skill is nevertheless an important factor. Most importantly, the core mechanics of the game are elegant, fun and quick, so this one gets a higher rating from me than I might have expected (being relatively luck averse). The 5P game, though, doesn't really work for me -- it's too many players chasing too few tiles over the course of a round to be fun; 3-4P is a significantly better experience.

Very nice game. The theme is said to be a trifle thin but I find it works well. Play with the player mats, available as a download, and the game really comes alive.

RATING: 8
A set collection bidding game with scoring rules that aren't really complicated but - as you might expect from Knizia - not as straightforward as other games. Tiles get randomly added to the pool that is auctioned off either when full or when one of the players decides to call on Ra. Then follows a single bidding round with the player who has started the auction bidding last. Each player has a limited set of bidding tiles with values from 1 to 12, and when you run out of tiles you're done for the round.

Lots of unusual twists but still easy enough to grasp to make a good auction gateway. That's not to say evaluating the lots is easy, though...

I love auction games, and so it might be no surprise that Ra is on this list also. Ra's auctions are more straight-forward than Karensansui's, but the additional management of sun tokens is quite a mind-frak. The additional set-collection aspect of Ra is what really puts it over the top for me, slightly edging out Karesansui.

Is it an auction game or is it a set collection game?  I think it is the best combination of both.  I love the tension and the tough decisions throughout the game.  I have only played it with the player mats that I printed out on BGG.  I wish the game had come with some nice player mats to make it easier to see what you are collecting.  Fun and just the right amount of time.

This one climbed much higher once I downloaded the player mats! Until then I could never get a handle on how points were scored. Now I love the game. I haven't played it much over the past 7 years, but recently started playing it again and realized what a great game it was! Sure, it has a paper thin theme, but the game works! If you have trouble with the scoring, print out the player mats found on the 'geek. It will enhance your enjoyment of the game.

Acquired 05/03/06

There are so many things I like about this game I don't know where to start.  Simple, simple rules that can be taught in five minutes.  But mastering the game...that could take some time.  Constantly challenges you to evaluate auction lots on the fly, taking into account variables such as time left in the epoch, the suns that opponents have left, what tiles are up for grabs that will help you (or them) the most...small touches keep you from getting too specialized.

Until I get a copy of E&T, this will be the finest Knizia in my collection.  And even then, I think I like this just as much.

Note to potential designers who want to make an auction game:  if you can't top this one (and likely you can't), don't even bother.

Nice interesting auction mechanic, where you are also bidding for your next bidding token.  I can see why it is considered a classic, but you really need to print and use the player mats on BGG. (rating 7.327, Sept 16).

Yeah, Ra!  Ra is a classic auction and set collection game.  Knizia pseudo-theme aside, the Egyptian style actually adds to the enjoyment of this one.  The rules are simple and although a bit mathy (it is a Knizia after all), there is no extra fat on this one.  It's a lean, mean, auction machine that has quite a few strategies to consider.  Ra deserves a space on the game shelf of any auction game lover.

What is there to be said that others haven't already wrote dissertations on.  The best auction game hands down.

UPDATE:  Although my group has taken a break from the steady diet Ra offered up in the early parts of '06 (shortly after it's reprint), Ra still makes regular gaming time and still continues to impress.  Rare for me, but even with less table time Ra has proven its longevity and so therefore rises in my rating to a solid 9.

I like the scoring mechanism, but the auction element bothers me tremendously.  Far too often the bag will give you a losing choice if you start the auction, but a winning choice for the next player.  I quite like It's Mine, which takes the scoring mechanisms and ties it to a nice light game.

This game is a typical accessible "elegant" Euro.  A few simple components and rules that cleverly interact with each other to produce a satisfying "light strategy" gaming experience.  The auctions can be a bit repetative.  

I am left with the feeling that the reason this game is so highly rated is that it was out of print for so long.  I find that out of print games tend to suffer rating inflation that is never really corrected when they return to in-print status.  A fine game, but I don't find myself playing it much anymore - ended up selling my copy.

An excellent take on an auction game.  The fact that each player is limited by their sun tiles and the Ra track filling up can make every turn a tense decision between drawing or calling Ra.  Bidding can take some thought if the value of the pot don't exactly match the value or your sun tiles.  And the last couple Ra spaces in each epoch usually turn into a game of chicken as the last player(s) try to squeeze the most out of the epoch before it ends.  In short, the game is filled with lovely, tense decisions but plays quickly and cleanly.

I'm really surprised by how much I like this game. I've read about it before and it just seemed boring to me. I played it, and it had a nice amount of tension that came when bidding or worrying if others would take the tiles. There is a nice amount of randomness. Nobody knows when the Ra's will be drawn (when 8 are drawn, that round is over), so you have to use your suns wisely. Do I use my suns now in fear of the round running out? Do I save them later for better opportunities?

I also really like the system of the suns. Even if you have some really low ones, you are not screwed because of the way the system works. Everybody only has 4 suns to use per round, so if you have low ones, you can keep activating auctions to either force others to use their high ones or snatch them yourself. 

Very interesting game.

Played this once with all newbies.  I have learned we were playing the rules completely wrong!  Players felt a bit bewildered as the scoring systems had to be explained over and over.  Once everyone is familiar with the tiles and scoring then you can have fun and feel the Knisia squeeze.  I liked the interaction.  I hope to play it again, unfortunately wife dislikes auction games.

I have been interested in this game for quite some time now and have had it on my want list for a while to. When I finally got around to reading the rules I became even more intrigued. I would of liked to play it before I bought it, but the opportunity never arrived. So I decided to give it a shot and get a copy. I am pleased to say that it was a well worth purchase.

This is an excellent auction game with some really nice mechanics. It has a tiny bit of a luck element with the tile draw, but nothing so bad as to really interfere with the game. There can also be a bit of screw your neighbor involved, but again it's not overly done. The game is very well balanced and there are a few different strategies that can be used when playing. All of which could change at your next turn. This game really is a lot of fun.

The components are very well made and look good and fit the Egyptian theme well. I am a sucker for all things Egyptiian, so this goes over really well for me. I would highly recommend this game to everyone to at least try once or twice if the opportunity arises. I am also very glad that I took a chance on this game. It was well worth every cent and then some.

My first game of this was, frankly, awful. (It lasted 90 minutes,  which is too long by 1/2.) The only reason I gave it a 2nd chance was because of a discounted copy in an upscale toy store... which is a good thing, because I've grown to really enjoy the game.

This is my favorite auction game. There is a ton of strategy mixed with a good smattering of chance. The game plays in a nice amount of time.

Acquired February 2012 from BGG Replacement Secret Santa

Update March 2012: Have played this game three times and find it excellent. I have read about it on BGG for years, but never understood why it was to popular, until I played it. It is ideal for 5 players, with auctions and set collection. Knizia certainly created a fabulous game, with many different ways to score, and several ways to end with negative scores. This will receive many more plays in our family group.

November 2012 -- Haven't had a chance to play this recently, but expect to do so this winter. It is a popular game with at least four of us, and I think is best with five.

2013-November:  A very challenging game, and popular with the family, but we just haven't had very many opportunities to play it.

As usual, I stink @ R.K.'s games... But I do appreciate the mechanics and the genius of the game.  Since I've lost every game I played, and my friend Chris won most of them, I KNOW that this game isn't as luck driven as I like to think... Perhaps the score would go up higher once I figured out how to win?

I&#039;ll join the chorus: Ra is an incredible piece of work. Several different methods of winning, lots of crucial (but far from obvious) decisions and a nice dose of risk-taking. Do I bet on this set or wait and see if something even better comes up... A hit amongst my non-gamer friends as well.

Personally, I do find the game graphics poorly designed (which is not a big issue since this is an auction game). Link with Egypt indeed rather weak. But! Although very simple mechanics, quite a nice game... Involves bluffing, taking risks and (unfortunately) also a little bit of (or sometimes even a great deal of) luck. But that's what bidding and auction is all about, isn't it? A score of 7 well deserved...

A good auction game with a nice challenge of collecting sets and bidding your tokens wisely.  You can really hurt yourself in later rounds if you are stuck with low numbers to bid with.

Ra is a seamlessly flowing auction game that's classic Knizia. You collect sets of who knows what. Does it matter? So smooth and mathematical, it feels like a computer designed the game. That doesn't matter because of an exciting press-your-luck element and brilliant simplicity.

The best auction game ever, period, and my favourite Knizia´s design. Teach Ra is an easy task, learn it as well, but understand the mechanics, the interaction among the different tiles, and the timing of the bidding, is really a challenge. Ra needs less than one hour to be played among skilled gamers and a little bit more in the first games. But you should avoid Ra if you dont like auctions games. Its scalability is average: excellent with three, very good with four but I dont like it with five due to the lack of control over the bids. This is just a personal impression since many other players enjoy it with five as well.

RA is a fun game with some basic flaws.  The turn end can appear suddenly or take a long time.  There are sound strategies to follow in either of these cases but because you don't know when a turn will end you can only opt for a best guess.  Scoring happens in a variety of ways.  One of the most solid ways to score is to get an early lead in pharaohs and defend it, picking up other bonuses along the way.  Most of my wins and losses can be traced back to getting the pharaoh balance right or wrong.  Or the game just ending in a flurry.  A little more predictability would be nice.  Ra is still short (around one hour) and enjoyable, though.  I recommend it for light entertainment with a bit of thought and strategy.

Raised my rating from 7 to 8 after more playings.  I did not expect to enjoy this game as much as I do.  The tie-in with the theme is almost non-existant, but somehow it works for me.  Plays fast (especially on BSW) and is loads of fun.

Raised rating to a 9 after quite a few plays on BSW.  This is not a game I expected to like so well, but somehow I do.  Moves along quickly and has a nice mix of luck and tactics.  I can see why it is so popular.

After about 100 plays on BSW I've moved this up to a 10.  Just find the mix of luck and push-your-luck calculating superb.  What a piece of genius this game is.  

More plays and I continue to thoroughly enjoy this game.

There is something almost ungame-like with this game. And yet I love it! Lots of interesting decisions, mainly around timing and bluffing, which make for great player interaction for a game that seemingly has none. Tremendous game! Believe me.

RATING: 8.25
This is one of the most enjoyable auction games I've played, and I'm not a big fan of auction games. It's more than just an auction game, though, as it also employs tile collection. Because of the mechanic of the auction system, one has to bid judiciously and consider how current bids impact bidding in future epochs. It's easy to understand and jump into but perhaps deeper than it seems at first glance.

Played once and man I don't think there has ever been a fire quite like this one to run it back immediately. Very fun, not sure how long it would last but can't stop thinking about it. 

edit: I'd like to play this, cyclades, modern art, and amun re all in the same day to compare them. Those are probably my favorite auction games. Right now I think Cyclades would come out on top, then this (because you don't always want a dudes on a map experience) or modern art, and then amun re. Though amun re shares the auction mechanic with cyclades that I like the best of all these.  

edit: so I just played this again. I think that I first got interested and excited about it when I hadn't really played many auction games and was used to playing games that were 2 hour grinders. Upon replay, pretty over it, but think it's a quality design. It does do a good job of making you feel clever when you can get a good deal for your bid though. 

Would rather play any of the other three that I listed before this again.

Wow, excellent game.  Way better then I expected.  Mainly an auction game which scared me but it is done in such a unique way.  At this point wish I was playing right now.  Will probably get sick of it eventually, but I think it will be a while.  Okay played about 20 more times and still not sick of it.  This is truely a great game.  One of the best out there.

Ra is a masterpiece of timing and probability.  Luck can be cruel, but smartly playing the odds and paying attention to your opponents will usually prevail.  I love the way the game packs a lot of wallop into a series of extremely restricted choices.  Some are turned off by the weird combination of elegant mechanics and esoteric scoring rules, but it's the complexity of the scoring that makes the decisions so tasty.  Best with three or four players, but still very good with five.

Very good auction game. I need to find a balance between getting enough tiles for myself and not wasting my suns. Initially rate a 9, which is well-deserved, but lowered it to an 8 because I suck at auction games and don't want this one to influence future picks quite so much.

Can be played with 2 using the setup from Razzia!

I love playing new games. It is very difficult for a game to get more than 10-15 plays in my collection. It is even more unusual for me to suggest playing games I have owned for over a year and played 20+ times. This still happens with Ra. I love it. Simple but with very tough decisions. I actually enjoy the rather arbitrary tile scoring system because of its variety (as opposed to tile collecting games like Hanging Gardens or Alhambra). The only reason it is not a 10 is that it can simply be excruciating to watch people over bid on tracks only to win because you draw 5 Ra tiles in a row to end the round.

Moment of Glory: Invoking Ra and hearing the entire table grumble.

RATING: 10
Seventeen plays. So clever and well-balanced it seems to have a life of its own. May be a bit bewildering at first, but after a couple of plays one acquires a feel for all the little nuances—how much the tiles are worth in a given circumstance, how quickly the end of an epoch can sneak up, when it's too late to worry about monuments, how likely one is going to find a flood in time for scoring, et cetera. One of the best middleweight games you're likely to find.

A few words about theme: the game is certainly abstract in the sense that what the players are doing has no real-world analogue; they take a god-like role and sort of vaguely improve the prestige of a dynasty. Or something. However, I don't think it's fair to be too dismissive of the game's thematic elements. If nothing else, it helps to inform the somewhat complicated scoring. The pharaohs represent socio-political power—a popularity contest on a grand scale—and so it's fitting that all that matters is coming in first (or at least not coming in last!). Agricultural improvements are lasting, but they only benefit you if the weather cooperates. Grand monuments are meaningless in the short term, but, since they remain even after the culture has died, they earn you a lot of posterity points at the end. As far as the civilization advances go, well, come on, your society has to invent SOMETHING or you're going to look like a total shlub. Ever forward, you know? Meanwhile, gold is always good, though it never seems to stick around.

All these elements sketch out a particular point of view of what the concept of "civilization" is all about, and so I think the game actually does provide fuel for the imagination. It's not so much a simulation as an essay with some nice pictures.

RATING: 7
2005 acquisition.  Beautiful game board and lovely artwork in the tiles.  Likely test driving this in a 2-player game soon.

Play 1 and a half 2-player game.  We used the 2-player variant suggested in the geek.  The first half game was aborted as we played it wrong, but once we got the rules right we started again.  I know there are some geeks who swear by how much fun they had playing this with 2 players, unfortunately, it just doesn't work for me with 2 players.  Everything we did seemed very mechanical.  I guess that's why it is recommended for 3-5 players.

I need to try this again with more people.

Increased my rating to 7.  3 players make the game much better than 2 but I think it depends on the people who you play the game with.  With less experienced players it may be difficult for them to judge when to start an auction and how much they should bid for the tiles.

As is normally the case with bidding games it is better played with experienced players. Plays equally well with 3, 4 or 5 players and is ok with 2 *UPDATE* I have now introduced Ra to my family and it works brilliantly.

What an excellent game! Reading the rules made it sound a bit abstract but after we started playing we found that it's surprisingly thematic! The mechanics make perfect sense with the theme and it flows very well. The uncertainty of when the auctions will happen makes it very exciting and losing your winning Sun tiles makes decisions painful. The scoring is also very well designed. I'm glad it was reprinted!

You need to understand what to get in Ra and when. There is also a lot of luck involved. I also sometimes forget what each tile means. You can manipulate to get the higher numbers (bidding sun tokens) so that you start with better numbers at the next part of the game. You also should say “Ra“ at the right time. And you should know when you really need to win the auction.

I'm not a fan of the "point salad" aspect of the scoring, but the way the bidding tokens are used (i.e., winning bids become part of subsequent auctions) is clever.

Interim rating of 9 after just 2 plays - it seems like a very simple, elegant game that has a lot more thought involved than it first appears.

Update: I've now played a few more times and my opinion has improved even more. As mentioned it is a simple yet elegant game, and it also has a lot of depth. On top of that it is great fun to play because the auction mechanism actually allows for a lot of player interaction and the opportunity to screw other people. Given that it clocks in at around 30-45 minutes as well and it plays equally well with 3, 4 or 5 I think it's definitely deserving of a 10 rating.

Edit: Still great and probably my go-to auction game but other new games mean it's lower down the pecking order when it comes to choosing what to play. Dropping to a 9 to reflect that.

RATING: 9
Since bidding isn't at the top of my favorite game mechanisms list, it is a bit unlikely that I would so highly rate a game where bidding is a central core of the design. But, the key is that in Ra the bidding is not an opened ended determination of the right value to bid. Rather, you have 3 bid 'tokens' (suns) for a given epoch and the decision is on when to use them to obtain tiles from a finite but uncertain pool of opportunities. This transposition of the decision is a key element of the design. This is coupled with a multivariate scoring system that is applied at the end of each epoch and at the game end. In the usual Knizia way, the scoring has players attempting to cover multiple dimensions, but not enough opportunity to cover all the bases.

A perfect game of bidding. A very fast game, and very well balanced. I have not been able to construct a good overall strategy for this game. Strongly recommended for both serious gamers and non-gamers. I introduced this game to different groups and they all loved it. This is a very important factor for me.

Push your luck mixed with a limited auction system = gold dust. This is getting better the more I play, both as a two and three player game. Not everyone is going to dig it, as it really can work the head, but deservedly thought of as a classic Knizia. One of very few games my girlfriend doesn't want to play, because it gives her massive AP nightmares! But I absolutely love it.

I recognise that it's a good game - it's well thought out / designed and it's quick. However, I struggle with it a bit.

I think it's a bit cut-throat. I have faired badly in a few of the games I have played. 

There are 3 rounds (Epochs). Epochs can come to an end very swiftly. The most vexing aspect of the game is being left with tiles (especially high value ones) that you haven't been able to use before the epoch has ended.

Although I think I have finally got a handle on this game now I do have a tendency to hold out for a better deal that doesn't come up and then find that I have missed the out - annoying!

(JAB Mars 2012) Un coup de coeur décidément. Un jeu d'enchères plutôt court assez simple et très interractif qui plait à toute catégories de personnes. C'est un jeu qui allie bien le hasard et la stratégie. Le seul petit côté négatif est que lorsque quelqu'un a misé tous ses soleils il doit attendre que tout le monde ait fini pour continuer à jouer. C'est un jeu qui a provoqué bien des fous rires et des stress euphoriques lors de mes expériences de jeux. C'est un jeu de gamble où on évalue le risque de piger un Râ et décréter une enchère qui mène vers la fin du jeu vs la probabilité de piger des tuiles intéressantes. Parfois on pousse sa luck: parfois on gagne, parfois on perd. Un excellent jeu pour tout le monde! Le thème du jeu est également bien présenté par le matériel du jeu. Ce jeu est tout à fait original et divertissant!

Finally played this- can't believe I got it off Tanga for such a good price. This is a really good bidding game with some great twists.

Finally got a chance to play this. I think I enjoyed it quite a bit more than anyone else I played with, which is a shame. I really need to play it a few more times, but I can already tell that there are multiple paths to victory here. I love that the "bad things" that happen don't just happen to you, you have to decide if you want to bid on them as well. And the auction mechanic of putting what you pay in the middle for the next auction is something I haven't ever seen before, and it works beautifully. I got complaints from other people about downtime and randomness, but I didn't see either one of those things being an issue. UPDATE: My rating has risen as I've played it more. I often don't like games where at the end you have to count everything up and see who won, but the mechanics of the game itself (mostly) make up for this drawback. I can't see it ever being in my top 10, but I would never want to part with it either.

I've played this game many times, and often win.  Also, I usually like Knizia games.  But for some reason, I don't really like this one.  Perhaps it's much more of a press-your-luck game than his other ones, because there is little control over the upcoming tiles.  I think I often win because I exit the auctions early -- I get what I want, and *don't* press my luck, while everybody else fights till the Ra track fills up.  Too much randomness kills the fun in many games for me.

I've only played Ra one time, but it has left a great impression on me.  One of my favorite things about board games is the multiple avenues you can achieve victory.  In Ra, having the highest score wins, but how you get there is entirely up to you.  Will you try and hoard monument tiles and play the long game, or will you try to get a million rivers/floods in the interim, ever so slowly adding your score up.  

A competitive game I wouldn't mind owning.

Recently realized what many fans of Ra have in common: poker.  Knowing which tiles remain in the bag and what other players need, etc. you can make reasonable estimates of your odds to improve, etc.  As with poker you can't guarantee a win, only maximize your odds.

[Initial Impression: 8]
This is a fascinating auction game that contains multiple scoring mechanisms and some highly strategic options.  On each turn, the player either turns up a new tile (which will generally add to the value of the lot to be auctioned), steals a valuable tile (if in possession of a rare god tile), or calls an auction.  It can be very tricky to call an auction, as you have to decide whether you're in a position of strength to win the auction, or if in a position of weakness, whether you can force others to use their higher-value tiles to take an auction lot that isn't particularly valuable.  Call an auction too soon and you'll be stuck bidding on a low-scoring lot, call it too late and someone else will place a high bid to take the high-scoring lot from you.  The auction mechanism can be a bit wonky, as it is a once-around auction and each player starts with a predetermined set of tiles (essentially a convoluted way of making it possible for each player to win a certain number of auctions per round).  With many possible ways to score, it can be very difficult to value each lot, and every lot will hold a different value to each player, depending upon what they've acquired earlier in the game.  Catastrophe tiles, which will destroy some of your previously acquired tiles, can sometimes "poison" a lot, making it of negative worth to some players and positive worth to others.  There can also be a press-your-luck element if you are the only player remaining in a round, as you get to pull as many tiles as you want while hoping that you don't pull one that will end the round before you can take your guaranteed lot.

Ra is a press-your-luck set collection/auction game with what was originally a unique auction mechanic, pre-Feld-ian punishment, and just a generally fun, interactive feel.

Players bid with a limited number of Suns to win sets of tiles, collecting to gain points before the round ends.

It's fairly cut and dried who would win each auction- if they want to- but the valuation of what would be gained and when it is time to strike is what really makes this game.

Sometimes its obvious what your opponents want, sometimes less so- and how you value the tiles/situation is what sets your bid.

It's easy to see that despite a "non-theme" theme, this is a fun an enduring game, and it gets a lot of love on BGG.

I just wish I could get it to the table more often...

I have played this game about 6 times, and each time it leaves me cold for some reason.  My score of "5" is probably generous, but reflects the fact that I can see many nice game aspects there.  The auction method is interesting, and unique that you get the number tile on the board.  

However, I just can't get into the spirit of the game.  Even with a playmat, I can't see any real strategy to employ (or at least one I can stick to) and feel that I am just taking random stabs at tiles.  

So, in summary, played it an not really interested in playing again or ever owning.

Just had another play of this and upgraded it from 6 to 6.5 I still dislike it for the same reasons I dislike Alhambra, in that the choices presented to you are usually obvious and so it becomes more of a luck thing as to who picks the tiles that benefit them.

Admittedly it's more sophisticated than Alhambra and so I've scored it higher but it's certainly not worth more than 7

I'd try it again but wouldn't buy

Edit - ok bought this for my brother, it's his sort of game. On reflection I think there is more to this than I initially said so am going to update to 7.5

(02/28/2009) A wonderful, bidding game, with a "push your luck" element. Very simple turn with few options: 1) pull a tile out the bad, or 2) call 'Ra!', or 3) play a god tile, if you have one. If Ra is called, there is a bidding round to determine who gets the tiles in the center, which is then added to other tiles in their collection to build up fame/legacy points, over three epoch periods. However, there are only so many bids one can make, before being locked-out of the auction for a particular epoch, so players must choose wisely when to 'Ra!'. Fun, thoughtful, game that plays in 45-60 minutes with up to 5 players.

Update (07/16/09): Upping this to a '9' from '8'. It definitely holds up with time, compared to other games.

Update (10/30/11): The original Uberplay version was so much nicer than the reprint. The tiles and fame tokens were much larger. The wooden sun tiles were a bright yellow, instead of this sickly orange color of the reprint. The tiles themselves had an "x" mark to indicate if they were removed at the end of an epoch. Still, the game itself is good. I'm just ranting about the quality of the reprint.

Update (08/25/13): After awhile, this game is no longer a "9", so dropping it to "8". Game hasn't seen much play lately.

Update (01/10/14) 10 plays: Not bad for a pseudo-gateway game. While it is totally luck of the draw, there is some element of skill required to do well. Still, the chaotic nature is starting to bug me. Dropping to a "7".

Man, I liked this.  Nobody else did.  And the solitaire version requires serious hypnosis, or something.

UPDATE:  Miraculously, this made it to the table again, years (!) later...  and everyone agreed that it deserves deeper exploration.  Looks like it's getting moved into the regular rotation!  Huzzah!

UP-UPDATE:  Damn, this is a great game.  The constant shift in values (with both the lot up for bid being worth different amounts to each player and the power/value of your suns (money) fluctuating as play progresses) makes for a pretty intense game of bluff, brinksmanship, and double-guessing...  It's maddening to have to think about taking a lot that you have absolutely no interest in purely to keep it out of the hands of someone who will score big off of it; it's equally sphincter-clenching to find out that you've worked yourself into a corner where someone else's 1 sun is more powerful than your big, fat 13.  Invoking Ra purely to goad someone into overpaying (just a tad) for something you don't want anyway is sweaty fun.  I could go on and on.  There are depths to this game that aren't even hinted at in the rulebook.  Far, far more than the sum of it's parts.  Deliciously subtle.

Three players may be the sweet spot, as our initial game with five seemed slippery and thin in the control department.

Edit (Aug2016) - score upgraded after playing Razzia! a few times.  I now "get" it although I think I still like the Razzia! theme a bit better (makes a bit more sense - i.e., car + driver = points).  Also I'm happy to have acquired the Alea version with the "1" on the side!

...

I never really "got-it" nor do I understand why it's so highly rated... it seems like a complicated set-collection game with fiddly rules (i.e., each type of tile to collect has different ways of scoring)... I do like the sun-tile auction mechanism, but feel like it could be used in a better game.

Ra is a brilliant game.  There is so much to like about this game - the fact that the sun tile which wins an auction becomes part of the next items being auctioned; the fact that the sun tiles you win during the first and second epochs will be your bidding ammunition during the next epochs; the push your luck aspect at the end of epochs; the poison pot dilema with catstrophe tiles; the different scoring of tiles, some across epochs, some at the end of the game; the fact that some tiles are discarded after each epoch and others stay throughout the game; the randomness of the Ra tiles, making some epochs end quickly and others run longer.  I love auction games and this is the best in my book.  I will play this game any time.  I've played hundreds of games of the excellent computer version as well.  This game plays very well with the 2-player variant.

How did Reiner think of this? Beautiful end game mechanic. Everything works well.

The sun pieces and the Ra statue are made of wood! I don't know why but it enhance the game. Sadly, the board is ugly and the scoring aid texts is small and poorly tought-out. Also, there should be a little icon on the tiles that get removed from play each round.

Why do most people call this an auction game? Because of this I did not try out the game for years and only got to know it in 2009. I rather call it a set-collecting game with a simple market system (as each player does only have a very limited supply of "currency" to pay for tiles and all of this is open information) and a can't stop mechanism.

Great family game and next to Ingenious one of Knizia's best works.

Wow!  I love this game.  I have played it with gamers, good friends, couples-night, church game night, and it's always been a success.  It's a tough sell at first with non-gamers, and you NEED the little player aid tile maps for new players.  I am pretty passionate about this one and would play it almost anytime.

It can be fun with the right group but Ra doesn't really engage me.  I feel like I'm bidding to maximize my points (& force the other players to take sub-optimal outcomes) rather than anything to do with an Egyptian empire ...

I don't mind playing a quick game against AI components when I've got nothing else to do but like many Knizia's (but not all) the theme just doesn't work for me.

The scoring is a little complicated which makes explaining it to new players (especially those without much boardgaming experience) difficult and makes it hard for new players to properly value the auction lots. However, once played a few times everyone seems to really enjoy it.

With experienced players, can finish a game in ~30 minutes.

RATING: 7
tldr: Simple auction game to teach/learn. You have 3 numbered tokens that you spend when you win a bid, so you may win up to 3 bids per round, one time around auction-style. The simplest advice newbie is to be sure you are gaining points each round (because it is easy to get negative points!)

An auction game that plays over three rounds. Players take turns drawing tiles from a bag until someone calls an auction (by saying "Ra!") or by drawing a Ra tile. Bid is one time around, using the three numbered tokens you have to place a bid. Winning the bid gives you the tiles up for auction (some which may "corrupt" tiles in your collection) and the previous money token used in the last auction. This money token will be available for use in the next round. 
A round ends either when all players have won three auctions (so they have used all three money tokens) or when a certain amount of Ra tokens have been drawn from the bag.

There is a set collection element going on here. Many ways to score negative points if you do not obtain particular types of tiles or if you have the least of a certain type. Should fall in the 45 minute range. Ra!

Could a game be LESS related to its theme? Actually this is my second favourite bidding game after Modern Art, even though the usual Knizia complex scoring gives it the feel of a maths problem tossed out by a professor for the students to chew over. Only bit I don't like is the last player in an epoch being left to play a push-your-luck game with the tile bag.

An "auction" game where you can only bid in limited amounts.  Look at the game as push your luck and it makes more sense, but it's too long for push your luck and too restricted in bidding as an auction game.  Nice bits help lift an otherwise drab game from also-ran status.

Ra is a good versatile auction game with a good balance of randomness and long-term strategy (and basically long-term betting, as you don't know how much the different types of tiles could tilt the balance in your favor).

I enjoy it myself, but the problem with it is that it's a little too abstract, so it can be a little difficult to teach to non-gamers (i.e. too many almost-arbitrary tiles that have to be memorized).

By Reiner Knizia. 3p, 4p or 5p? An auction game with tiles, set collection, tableau building and push your luck. Asmodee edition is expensive. Uberplay tiles seem clearer (/video/106829). Player mats make it easier to evaluate tableaus.

First played this on April 10th, 2007.  This game is fun, doesn't take too long to learn or play based on all the components of it.  We played with 5 people and it played pretty well.  There seems to be a lot of different strategies to take on and there is it's share of luck.  It took a game play to figure out what strategies to try.  I'd recommend giving this one a try.  Don't be discouraged if you don't feel like you know what you are doing, it should come to you after a game play or two.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Easy to teach and easy to learn, but players should never underestimate the tough decisions Ra forces them to make.  With nearly all information public and only three possible decisions on your turn the game is all about making good value judgments - What are the tiles worth to me?; What are the tiles worth to my opponents?; and how can get the tiles for the cheapest amount possible (or get my opponents to pay the most for tile)?

Ra is a simple set collection game using auctions.  The mechanics are very stripped down but the game still remains surprisingly fun.  It's really hard not to start chanting "Ra, Ra, Ra" on a player's draw when things get tight.  I think the game is social and exciting enough in an indirect sort of way to override the pretty pasted-on theme.  -As usual, a great Knizia outing.

An auction game that somehow manages to rob the tension from auctions. It reduces what is normally an extremely tense and interesting game mechanic into a quick series of once around exchanges.

The strategy of when to bid and when to hold out for the end of the round is marginally interesting, but I find the sun mechanic frustrating instead of nerve-wracking.

One can argue that the elegance of design and artistic bits cannot be surpassed. One could point out that there are very few decisions to make and yet they're very difficult and require a lot of skill for a game so short. Ultimately I just think that the reason it deserves a 10 is that all of the above and other things make me want to play it pretty much whenever I can. Works really well with 2 and 3 players.

New to my collection, and destined to become one of my favorite warm-up games. A relaxing play. It is not that deep or complex (especially for naturally analytical players), but Ra requires focus to give oneself the best opportunity to win (random aspects notwithstanding--they are minimized, but can still play a role). Be sure to obtain a larger drawstring bag; you will need it!

Another round-limited game, but it works well here.  Lots of randomness make for a good number of replays and interesting tension as players bid on tiles.  Should I outbid here with my 15 or wait for something better?  Plays fast, too, which adds to its "just one more game"ness.

My set came with an extra pyramid, but a friend's had the exact number of necessary tiles.  Be sure to count out the tiles before playing!

One of the best auction games I have played, this is definitely an above average game.  If I were someone who really enjoyed auctions this would be a "9".  I don't really care for them, but this game plays so well that it gets this relatively high rating from me anyway. This rates a half-point higher than its sibling Razzia because of the considerably nicer components and the addition of the devastation tiles which add a higher element of risk to "waiting just one more tile" before you call Ra.  However, the theme itself doesn't seem to work as well with the mechanics as the Razzia theme.  A game with Razzia's theme, Ra's component quality, and an equivalent of the disaster tiles would rate another half-point higher in my book.

RATING: 9
Warning - DO NOT judge this game on the BSW or computer version, it plays/feels COMPLETELY different in person! 

Knizia plus tiles = MAGIC. That really sums it up and every game I've played of his actually. We already played 3 games in 24 hours and its a new fav and very big on fun. For a simple auction and set collection game there is quite a bit of tension and strategy, some with timing and some with scoring making for some tough decisions throughout. Plays excellent with 2, even better with 3 and haven't tried more yet. The scoring in this is no where near as confusing as T&E, not confusing at all for me anyway just after reading the rules. This plays quickly and the game length is short as well making it quite accessible. RA stands for Radical Auctions or Remarkable Auction game! 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] ok 6 plays in 3 days, the rating has edged up and could more. The push your luck element in this is awesome and the game is addicting, like a "good potato chip", hard to play just once. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 11 or so plays now and 1 with 4 players which was also good, my initial love affair has died down now but this remains another beaut from Reiner, best middle weight I've played and probably the perfect definition of a 9 for me so rating will stay here I believe

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9 => 9.25 (probably a 10 though) High replay, scales perfectly from 2 to 5, plays fast with perfect game length of one hour, great gateway game (best I own) that is easy to teach and high high fun factor equals high desire to play, slight rating increase, definite favourite.

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 9.25 => 9 The luck is just too high to rate higher although the effect is somewhat lessened with less players, at least there is a little more control with 2 or 3 which are my favourite numbers to play. RA hit my usual ceiling at around 25 games which is no fault of its own (actually speaks well for it), I use this mostly as a gateway game now and it works very well in this regard.

After reading the rules, I don't think I have been so anxious to play a game. Great looking components.

My favorite Knizia, this is a cleverly limited auction game wrapped around clever scoring rules, with a nice dose of chicken chipped in for good measure.  Always thrilled to play this, and it's a game that I'll even play multiple times in a row.

RATING: 9
It took a bit to get through the rules at first, and I was initially scared that the scoring would be too complicated.  As soon as we started playing the first time though, everything seemed to "click" just right.

This game plays so fluidly yet seems to have so much depth.

The set up time for this is extremely minimal and play is probably around 45 minutes or less.  Because of this, the game is starting to become *the* board game we play when time is limited and we want something a little heavier than most of the card games we have.

Really looking forward to playing this more.

Great auction game. Quick and interactive, requires a good mix of skill and luck at the same time. While this isn't my favorite pure auction game it is very good and I wouldn't part with my copy. The light card version (Razzia) is quite good too though it is nicer since it doesn't have the disaster tiles. Either way, they're both great games.

RATING: 6
I'm not a big fan of auction games but not bad as far as they go.  You periodically bid on a set of tiles and try to accumulate sets that will give you lots of points, but every time you bid, the bid you used becomes part of the next lot for someone else to snag.  I never mind playing but I never find myself yearning to play it either.  There's not much in the way of creative strategies or in out thinking opponents and the theme is nearly non-existent, despite an Egyptian motif.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

I usually love a good auction game, but the mechanic that makes me dislike Ra is that one is very constrained with what can be bid. It's probably a great mechanic for those who hate long, drawn-out auctions in games, but I miss it tremendously here.

Nice auction game, but it'll take a few plays to get it's teeth into you. 

This always seems to be a popular choice with my group now, although I can't help thinking that I prefer some of Knizia's other auctioners a little more. The limited, publicly visible remaining bids in each players hand means it comes down to making very predictable plays sometimes. This is good, though, as it cuts straight to the psychological battle of trying to force other players into wasting their bids on inferior auction groups. Feels a little less fun and more basic than Traumfabrik or Palazzo, but there's no denying the elegance of Knizia's design here.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (May 2012)

After 1 play I can say I liked the game. I still think Modern Art is better but Ra is a fine game. I love auction games and Ra is one of the best auction games out there. As it is common with a Knizia game, the theme is very thin but the gameplay is very good and tense.

You have to make very hard decisions in a very short time frame. The multiple ways scoring system is very well done allowing for a lot of complex plays.

The game is simple enough to teach in 5 minutes but deep enough to appeal to the inner gamer in me :D.

I suspect with more plays the rating will go up.

With more plays I continue to like Ra, in fact I bought the game and I plan to keep it in my collection. Still I prefer to play Modern Art so Ra won’t hit the table as often. I’m downgrading its rating so it matched my feelings with the BGG recommended rating system. 

Still a good Knizia game.

After 1 play: So at last I get to test if the fuss around this game is deserved. Yup. It's a shame there's no connection between theme and game (I should see Razzia?) but the bits quality [i]is[/i] pretty good. The mechanics are simple elegant and unusual. It's the shifting values in multiple categories that make this a worthy head scratcher without burning out the neurons... otherwise just the mechanics would have me call this "light-medium" instead of "medium".

RATING: 5
It sure would be nice to have a clue what's going on in this game.  I've played maybe 10 times and still can't get over the mental hurdle.  That's probably a sign of its depth.

Update 7/2010:  I just don't ever seem to have fun playing Ra.  That's probably equal parts the crappy theme and my continuing cluelessness about how to do well.  Downrated, because not playing games actually sounds more appealing than playing Ra at this point.

RATING: 8
Looks (and is) hugely abstract, this has as much to do with ancient Egypt as it does with mowing my lawn ... but it is one of the most fun auction games out there. 

While at first the scoring rules look very obtuse and make the game look more complicated than it really is, on each turn usually you only have a choice of one of two things to do (call 'Ra!' or draw a tile). But as with all of Dr. Knizia's best games, behind the simple rules lies a subtle and constantly changing game. 

You can only win a maximum of three sets of tiles in each of the three rounds, so balancing the best point scoring opportunities for yourself against baulking others makes for some deliciously agonising decisions.

Deservedly a Euro-classic, and for me on a shortlist of two for the definitive auction game (alongside Dr. K's Modern Art).

Dutch, 999 Games & Uberplay editions (w/player aid mats).   This is a quick and easy to learn family-friendly game with a surprising amount of substance to it.  RA is a game of tactical bidding and set-collecting that requires the ability to maximize limited opportunities while supporting a variety of ways to score.  I like the intense excitement felt by the contrast in luck and control in drawing and bidding for tiles while attempting to collect and/or manipulate various valued tiles to and from your opponents.  Best when played with 3.

After a few plays so far: an excellent game with the typical Knizia bidding quandaries and scoring quirks, with the advantage of a quick flow and modest duration.  Makes Amun Re seem a little ponderous (the author, theming, and bidding mechanisms do make comparison inevitable).

This game is all about assessing the value of tiles for you and your opponents in auctions. Auctioning is not a means to an end here; it's the game. The Egyptian theme is 100% pasted on, this game might as well have been an abstract. It's good fun to slam the Ra figure on the board, yell "Ra" and mess with someone's plan. Other then that this game hasn't got a lot going for it. The dry exercise in value assessing just doesn't make for a fun game.

RATING: 10
A true classic. As with Knizia's other masterpiece, Tigris and Euphrates, every element fits perfectly together. Although this is a pure auction game with only three or four auction values per epoch, there is still a ton of *subtle* strategic variety in when and what to shoot for. The aspect that I think makes this game special is that the last bid is included in the next auction, thus with each auction you are setting yourself up - good or bad - for future auctions. The game is perfect for what it is. Deceptively simple.

En primer lugar tengo que decir que odio los juegos de subastas. En serio, no puedo jugar a ellos porque me considero una persona que no sabe ver cuando es el momento adecuado para hacer una oferta y cuando es un buen momento para plantarse.

Afortunadamente, mis problemas con las subastas se solucionan cuando juego a este juego. En Ra no tienes una gran variedad de opciones para hacer una puja, sino que sólo tienes tres números por ronda. Eso hace el juego mucho más fácil para un jugador como yo, ya que limita las opciones sólo a tres.

Éste es un clásico juego de "colección de sets" con la mecánica de subastas antes mencionada.

First of all I have to say that I hate auction games. Seriously, I can't play them because I consider myself a person who can't see when it is the right moment to bid and when it's the good one to stop.

Fortunately, my problems with bidding are solved when I play this game. In Ra you don't a huge range of options in order to bid but only three numbers per round. That makes the game far easier for a player like me, limiting options just to three.

This game is a classic "set collection" game with the above mentioned bidding mechanics.[/color]

This is one of those games that is a good solid game but should not be anywhere near the Top 10, in my opinion.  There is a huge luck factor in having a really good tile pulled out of the bag by the player going in front of you.  Then you can use a God tile or call an auction, either winning it or forcing others to pay alot.  Sure, there is some skill involved in knowing what to do but there's good and bad fortune depending on what side of the "how many sun tiles left in the bag" side of the equation.  I much prefer the more interesting and dynamic game, Traumfabrik, by the same designer, which I feel is thematically and conceptually far superior to this game which is unfortunately much more widely known and available because of the publisher and its earlier publication date.

I'm not typically a fan of auctions, so I was pleasantly surprised by Ra. Easy to learn and fun, it is a cool push your luck/set collection game that moves quickly. The theme may be, as other raters here have noted, a bit pasted-on. That said, the art work is tasteful and interesting and contributes to Ra's overall appeal.

A well made bidding game. The game has stood the test of time in my eyes. I think of RA as a second generation game, which I also put Carcassonne and Settlers of Catan in. It isn't the old war games and yet I wouldn't classify them as games that came out ofter 2003 or so when I feel boardgaming exploded.

     Every game is a fun exercise in trying to figure how how valuable the tiles are.  How other players bid and how fruently the ra tiles come out make for the values to be different every round of every game.  Quick and fun, this is definitely a milestone auction game.

I came to Ra as a staunch skeptic of Knizia. At first glance you have a very simple auction game in which tiles are drawn from a bag and occasionally an auction for lots of those tiles is initiated. The game's 'bounce-rate' comes from the scoring complexity of the tiles: some are required to avoid penalties, some are worth more in the right combinations, some are short-term, some long-term, etc. etc. Valuation isn't exactly intuitive, and it's hard to learn it quickly because players only get one crack at each auction, and don't have an incremental currency. Indeed, the game features a kind of backwards-approach where you're trying to best apply chunky, discrete-value bids to constantly changing tile-sets. Every other auction game does it the other way around. 

Once you get over the initial hurdle, Ra is a classic. The system is incredibly fluid and resilient - it keeps players on their toes re-evaluating tiles, position, long-term potential, etc. High Suns and low suns both have their uses. Timing is huge, and close attention must be paid to everyone's relative position and incentives. Players who understand what's going on here should be engaged every step of the way. A turn is Ra is simple - draw or call - but the dynamics of the game are not. 

A lot has been said about the poor integration of theme in this game, but I think that's overblown. This game does 3000 years in 45 minutes, so of course there's no answer to the "who am I as a decision-maker?" question. The Suns vaguely represent an entire civilization's good will with Ra, in exchange for which boons in agriculture, architecture, etc. are received. The tiles do a decent job characterizing the ebb and flow of a civilization, with one year of history scaling to one second of game time. One auction in Ra represents the fortunes of 2-5 generations. It's not really a "problem" of gaffes or contradictions, it's a matter of detail. Look elsewhere if you want more of it.

Rating based on 1 play.  I think I would like this game more if I played it more.  The game seemed fun but I didn’t understand all the nuances and values of the tiles.

What. A. Beautiful. Game. I'd play this any day at any time with any body.  Period.  The more I get into Knizia's games the more I come to respect him.  The game is based on a fixed amount of "Money" (for lack of a better description) which can be used each epoch for bidding.  This money has absolutely no value other than being able to beat your neighbours amounts.  I just think it's so simple yet so complex.  As close to perfect as you can get.  The "Luck" factor even works VERY well with it.  there's the luck of the tile draw, but you can usually weigh the odds against what you've already seen come out.  In a 5 player game, it eventually comes down to a 50/50 draw for the last 2 tiles.  Beautiful!!  All of that, AND you get to say "RA" quite frequently.

Ra may be my favourite from the Alea big box series though I haven't played it enough yet to decide. This is due to my bias that I generally prefer more tactical games and evaluating values in auctions as a mean to succeed in contrast to learning generic strategies as in Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence.
Ra is one of the top auction games as it is quick and comparably accessible. The idea of a limited amount of bids with fixed values available to each player is brilliant. Combined with the push-your-luck element from the random tile draw replay and fun value is huge if you enjoy auction games.

Phenomenal auction game; the best of its class in my opinion. The scoring can seem overcomplicated to a neophyte, but it's this diversity in situational value that makes each tile draw very interesting. The value of a given set of tiles can fluctuate at a moment's notice and can mean different things to different players. That would be too chaotic EXCEPT that you can see exactly what everyone's bidding power is at any time. The key to success is to call auctions and manipulate players with strong bidding power to pay for mediocre lots, else you get it very cheap with your low power. There is nothing more satisfying than watching the high power tiles go unplayed as Ra closes off the board. Nothing more frustrating than watching a hesitant bidder freely grab 8 or even 16(!) free tiles at the end of an epoch. A lot of tactical strategy and enough luck and push-your-luck to keep everyone on their toes. Awesome. Awesome. One more time. Awesome!

Oh, Ra, why dost thou hate me?

A fun, lighthearted auction game that's amusingly themed and relatively easy on newcomers owing to the fact that the auctions are restrained and the options limited by the sun bidding tokens. Not as deep or as rich as Modern Art but also not as intimidating. There seem to be multiple paths to victory, though that is only based on my observations of others, not on personal experience. A monument strategic adopted early on seems particularly effective if the tile draws allow it. The trickiest bit for me is knowing what to do with the mid-value sun tokens (not expecting too much but not going out too early).

My favorite aspect of this game is how, once the game gets going, the items up for auction are worth different amounts to the different players.

That said, I don't enjoy explaining this game. The scoring seems so complicated that non-gamers sort of glaze over. And try as I might, I just can't figure out the role the players take on. They're not Pharohs, they're not gods. They oversee the development of a kingdom over three ages, but what are they?!

Even after reading the rules, I was completely bewildered by this game on my first play.  The second game has made it a little more clear.  It's not that the rules were complicated, but more that the bidding system of this auction-based game is so different than any other (even all the other Knizias I've played).  Knowing how to value the tiles, when to bid, when to pass and when to invoke Ra is a challenge.  I look forward to playing this more, and I suspect that my rating will go up with increased play.

Update: After 6 plays, it's beginning to click.  I'm raising my rating to an 8.  Further update: Who am I kidding, this needs to go up to a 9!  :)

Simple game of bidding and balancing how much the ante is worth. [b]Good mechanic, but actions feel forced at times.[/b] The person controlling the highest number has great control over the game. Overall, its ideal to have an average of high numbers (like [gameid=172]), but it's a balance of taking low numbers to get the tiles you want (kinda like [gameid=9027]).

It's [b]simple and fast. A recommended bidding mathy game[/b]. The mechanics and scoring are alluring enough to keep the game in the back of my mind.

What a wonderful surprise. Reading the rules might lead you to believe this is a brute force auction game collecting sets and lording it over your opponents. I.e. essentially quite dull. That would be the case if you hadn't noticed this was by Reiner Knizia (or didn't know who he was). When playing the game all sorts of considerations and push-your-luck style strategies must be employed. The theme fits quite nicely in this case and makes for a beautiful game. I wanted to play again immediately and expect this will be a regular on my various gaming tables.
If space is an issue I'd strongly recommend Razzia! It's a remake by Knizia but with cards.

There's a cool tile payout system, and a nice push your luck aspect, but the Sun tiles really make this game: they limit your decision space, increasing the pace; they make money management more interesting without making it convoluted; plus, they add to the interactions in how you can push your opponents: bidding 6 when your opponent has 2-5-13 forces their hand, without costing you much. Great stuff.

Auction game where you bid for sets with forty million scoring types and simultaneously for future bidding power. So far I like it a little less than Modern Art, which in spite of the randomly dealt cards is driven by player initiative; here everything in uncertain and sometimes you can/must trust in pure luck to hand you the points you need. The set collection seems overwrought considering there are considerably more elegant ways of achieving asymmetric valuation (as seen in for instance No Thanks!), but the bidding instruments are more manageable than the victory points of Modern Art.

Pure bidding game. Very dependant on the other players at your table. Which for me isn't the best of things... Seeing players get crazy good stuff just because nobody saw they actually already had uite a lot of it is... bah.
But yeah, the game is solid and quick to pick up. Rules explanation is annoying though. The basic rules pitch is very simple but then they see all that scoring stuff and immedietly demand more information, which then leads to them getting too much intel and just blanking out. I've got a structure to teach stuff like this, stop feeling like I've wronged you when I don't tell you about tiles that aren't in play yet! Jeezes.

Every bit as good with 2 players as with 3 or 4.  (Rules with 2:  Start one player with the {2,5,7,8} suns, and the other with the {3,4,6,9} suns.  Put the first Ra tile TWO spaces to the right of the space marked "3 players".)

This game is so simple yet it is one of the deepest game there is. Most of the game you either draw a tile or start an auction but the times you start the auction can mean win or loss for you. It is so tense when people look at each other and someone calls an auction and everyone just gasps. I love the tension of the game. It takes a couple of plays to get a hang of the game but when people get it then it is so much fun. I like For Sale for its simplicity but if we are playing a serious auction game Ra is the one we play. I also love the new artwork but the price is a bit high for what you get.

2017-02-25 - 8 - Fast paced one hour game with a lot of interesting decisions. I'm not a fan of bidding usually, but here auction is done very well (and is not taking forever as everyone can bid only once). I really enjoy player interaction in Ra where you force others to do what they don't really want to, or to let you go away with an easy cheap purchase. It's time to purchase Reiner Knizia's fan microbadge.

2017-03-15 - 9 - Great game which becomes one of my very favourites. Suprisingly, interaction with other players is huge in this one. It's a real fun when you let others to make agonising decisions.

2017-04-29 - 9->10 - Ra is amazing! It's a huge success among my groups. It plays differently depending on type of behaviour of other players. In two months since purchasing I played it many times and it became one of my very favourites.

2018-01-14 - This game is excellent with 3 and 4 players. With 5 it gets a little crowded, but it's still good. However with 5 I would choose Modern Art or Traumfabrik over this one. I'm still yet to try it with 2.

Great auction game. I really like the way the values of different tiles is really dependent on what else is out there. Maybe for that reason, I find this to be an easier auction game for first-timers to compete in than most -- where you really need to have a feel for values to do well. I think that's because the auctioning is done using tiles, so even a novice know their maximum value. This game remains fresh play after play. And I think it just plain looks great.

RATING: 8.2
Good game!  The theme, or motiff, is plausable.  As a pure auction game, Ra is all about leveraging your resources, and seeing what a lot is worth both to yourself, but to the other bidders.  The movement of the bidding tokens is innovative.  Knowing when you should prompt an auction, or add to alot is a key point, and this decision is tied to which bidding tile you hope to win with, what other bidding tokens you might have to compete against, and which bidding token you will get with the lot of goods.  Add in the disasters, the ticking clock of the Ra track, and you get a tense event that demands that the players take chances and cope with the luck of the draw.

Acquired soon after Puerto Rico, this has grown into one of my favourites. Wonderful art, and I think the theme fits very well with the mechanics. A worthy addition is the player air boards which provide both a handy overview of the tiles, a scoring summary and a consistent placeholder for the tiles over all players, providing easy overview of other players aquisitions. (I've provided a pdf of the original .jpg player aid for the Alea Ra version in the files section. It makes for easier printing with the correct dimensions.)

Bought this for EUR16 in a sale at Tradition in Uppsala, given that I'd read about it on the geek. Didn't know about it being OOP and sought after, so more power to me, I suppose. Also my first German edition game, I think.

A great game with very unique mechanics.  The main point of the game is to collect sets of different tiles over two epochs, and this is done by repeated "once-around" auctions.  In reality, however, this game boils down to pushing your luck and finding a balance about when to initiate auctions and how long to wait before you bid on them.  One of my top 10 favorite games of all time.

More the better, but even works with 2 in variant, seems short but the accumulation of tiles is fair and accurate to other size games.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: 
This is probably a perfect game, yeah there is some luck, but you have to use even the luck to your advantage in this game to win. Nice tiles and "suns". I'm actually pretty good at this game. More experienced players rarely let the board get too full of tiles before invoking Ra, so that takes a bit of the fun away because it is all about calling auction when your opponents possess higher tiles; then you can go in for your own auctions. It is a great balancing mechanism though.

RATING: 6
Ra is the perfect example of how to design an auction game: all the mechanisms work perfectly, and it has a really engaging "push your luck" element. Indeed, the game has only one flaw: the theme, which is nonexistent. 

I don't mind abstracts, but I would have preferred to bid for something more plausible than a God, a pyramid and bunch of gold coins: the theme is so thin it gets in the way, as scoring isn't straightforward at all. To make matters worse, it's utterly impossible to follow anything resembling a plan without truly understanding and internalizing the scoring mechanism.

Due to that, it can give a horrible first impression: someone will win, and few players, if any, will understand why. Still, it's worth a second try, because it's terribly fun and engaging. Every time your turn takes place a lot of interesting possibilities will emerge, so you'll have to decide what to do by studying the possible outcomes, while simultaneously deciding if you should push your luck a bit more.

The game plays extremely well both with three and four players and the experience is quite different with both: with three you'll have more things under control, while with four both luck and the agonizing decisions increase. With five chaos reigns supreme and can easily get frustrating.

Not a big fan of bidding games but this one really stands out due to the bidding tokens (rather than people choosing random sums of money) which give you motive for bidding mid to low range at times due to the fact that the tiles themselves are also winning conditions.

I hate all auction games...except Ra.

Every mechanism in this game is a part of a greater whole. The decision to launch an auction prematurely, the open auction mechanism, etc...Everything is important to make this a great calculation (with a touch of bluff) game.

Of course, being a Knizia game, the theme is useless and for this game it actually hinders the rules comprehension. The first thing I say to new players is "There is a theme, Ancien Egypt, now forget about it we play an abstract game". This one thing makes the game less attractive, and knock it from 10 to 9

The game is thematically somewhat interesting, I suppose, but mechanically, it felt overly complicated and wasn't very fun.

"Guess who's getting a snack!"

There's obviously a lot of depth and replayability in this auction game.  As in any auction game, it takes a while to get a good feel for how much the various tiles are worth, but values certainly change from game to game, due to the vagaries of the tile draw.  It's remained one of my favorite games and is light enough to teach to some casual gamers.  It's excellent for three, and it plays pretty quickly.

Auction game, with an Egyptian theme. (been reprinted)

Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles (suns). Once a player has used up his or her suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The various tiles either give immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three "epochs" (rounds). The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I really, really like this game.  You can teach it quickly and it plays fast, and I love the strategy.  It takes a few plays for people to catch on to what is sound strategy and what isn't, but that's okay because it plays fast.

RATING: 7.5
[2007.Oct.5] Ra is not just another auction game. The prolific game designer Reiner Knizia created a masterpiece with this one. In typical Knizia style, the game is simple to learn, but hard to master. The subtleties of starting an auction (by calling out "Ra!" during your turn) is what the entire game revolves around. The ancient Egyptian theme is a good fit for this game, although it could easily be ported to another theme. The game is played in three epochs with a scoring phase after each epoch ends. After first 2 epochs, some tiles are discarded while others remain; the 3rd epoch, culminates with each player scoring the monuments that their empire has built over the course of the 3 epochs. In my experience, the game scales well, whether it is played with only 3 players, with 4, or with all 5 players. The Überplay version of this game is well crafted, and should be present in every gamer's collection. May the Egyptian gods smile upon your empire... but beware their disastrous wrath, for they can be quite fickle.

Took several plays to "get" it. Interesting auction mechanism, different numbers for bidding are distributed to players. Different titles score differently (set collection). Player with the most of a certain title scores positive points, player with least titles of a type looses points. Feels like the game plays the player vs. the other way around. It is clearly not for everyone. Just can't get into this game even when I treat it as a trick taking card game with bidding. There are other Reiner Knizia games I like better: Samurai, Poison, and Tigris & Euphrates to name a few. This leaves me flat.

RATING: 3
Played several times, 4p, 5p.  This is highly luck based, and has serious aspects of push your luck.  I've seen people win (me) who have no idea what they're doing; that might say as much about the other players as it does the winner.  My last several games of this have taught me to HATE this game.  They were not at all fun; just horrible dragging affairs that sucked precious minutes of my life away.  I will never play this again, under almost any conditions.

Very well built auction game that speeds the process up by limiting possible bids to available tokens.  This is pure Knizia with smart scoring, lots of options and math friendly optimization.  All this is balanced with randomness of auctioned batches and variable turn length which prevents analysis paralysis and keeps things flowing smoothly.

I liked the money token system: The higher you pay leave an high token available to the next bidder. But for the rest, I hate it. It's all based on mathematical probabilities. It's just not interesting.

I'm a fan.  Played a dozen or two games on BSW.  It's RK's cleverest auction game, in the way that you have to balance your priorities and the wonderful sun-tile economy.

That said, the game is a bit too number-crunchy and mechanical for me.  There's none of the incentive manipulation and alliance-brokering in of Modern Art, nor the simplicity and theme-richness of Traumfabrik, both of which I own. 

Too, I suspect dealing with so many tiles would get tedious when done in real life instead of on the internet.  In sum, I like the game but feel no tug to buy a physical copy.

My wife and I never had any auction games, mostly since they tend not to work with just two players. However, we heard so many good things about [thing=12][/thing] that we finally decided to get a copy (plus, we reasoned, it would always be good to have in case friends came over). 

I convinced her to give it a try and she was skeptical---the rules sounded so simple, how could it be fun? But it was! And it worked great with just the two of us! The constrained auction works brilliantly with two. You really have to weigh in how much the set is worth to you and how much it's worth to your opponent, as well as how much the remaining auctions may be worth. There is also a bit of psychology to guessing when your opponent will bid or not. Arguably, the two player version is more tense and tight than with more since there's more control and less time for chaos between your turns. We did have some friends over and played several 4-player games which were good but different, with a little more "push your luck" now since it takes more time between turns. Still, a fun game and worthy of all its accolades (but you do need to print one of the excellent player mats found here).

RATING: 8
A very clever game though you have to play it many, many times until you start understanding all its nuances. The initial impression is that the luck factor is very huge and almost game breaking - only later will you realize that by playing wisely you can reduce the random element to a minimum. Like most Knizia games Ra has many scoring opportunities and you have to concentrate on only a few to be really successful, though you could try to spread thin and gamble a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ra is a brilliant bidding game with set bids. Instead of specific currency, players are given tokens with numbers which are then traded for another token with a lower or higher number together with its goods. This creates a rather unique bidding experience in which each player has to value not only the goods but also the numbered token that comes with it especially when said numbered token will then be used to bid again in the next round. A truly impressive game but as usual with most Reiner Knizia's games the scoring can be a little difficult to get used to but a very important aspect of the game as you need to know how to score in order to know how to value the tiles correctly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.2
A nice auction game, in which you try to time auctions to give you the best bargains, and make other players spend high for what they need.  On the down side, the scoring rules are hard to remember.  And I don’t like the end of round play, which amounts to betting against drawing a RA tile.

A few observations

* This game is incredibly simple and straightforward. The core rules systems take less than two minutes to explain, and the scoring takes, perhaps, another minute and a half. I can't explain Carcassonne or other "family" boardgames that quickly.

* The box and included draw bag for the Uberplay edition that I own need to be about 10% larger, or the tiles need to be marginally smaller. It is extremely difficult to mix the tiles up in the bag at the start of the game, and it is awkward storing the tiles in the bag inside the box, since they tend to prop up the board and, in turn, the top of the box.

* I have heard reports of the draw bag splitting along its bottom seam, but mine seems sturdy so far. My board has warped slightly, though, possibly due to the open design of the cardboard box insert or being propped up on top of the tiles. Publisher's take note - I am perfectly happy to pay another dollar or so for a well-designed, blown plastic insert that supports the gameboard well.

* While deciding whether to reprint Ra, Uberplay considered changing the theme to the free agent market in professional (American) football. This would have been a gigantic mistake. Although I am a sports fan, a lot of game geeks are not, and would have been actively turned off by the new theme. The Ancient Egypt theme is more abstract, and less likely to actively grab anyone's attention, but it is even less likely to turn anyone off in the way a sports theme would. I doubt a change in theme would draw in enough new, non-gamer, buyers to offset the number of gamers that would be turned off by it.

* Ra is underrated as a gateway game. Like I said above, the rules are extremely straightforward and easy to grasp. In addition, the graphics are eye-catching and the screwage is just about perfect - sufficient to avoid any feeling of multiplayer solitaire, but indirect enough to avoid bad feelings.

So All Hail Mighty Ra!, king of the middleweight auction games.

The mechanism of the ra tiles starting the auction, along with the fact that you also bid for bidding tokens you use in the next round are cool, but the different ideas for set collection scoring has been way overdone nowadays. Also has a surprising amount of luck despite its clever auctions. Overall, I just didn't have that much fun, but I think I would really enjoy a different game that implemented the auction system but had something else besides set collection to go along with it.

Another brilliant auction game, Ra lets you pick your strategy while still throwing curve balls at you and making you hedge a bit. You can't really ignore any of the various tile types, but you definitely have to focus somewhere to really accumulate critical points.

Very fun auction game with an Egyptian theme (though the theme doesn't really enter the play). Can play up to 5 players, though I've only played with 3--but it's always been fun with that number. My wife doesn't like it though, because if you're down too far at the end of the second (of 3) epochs, it's near impossible to make a comeback.

Great ancient Egyptian themed auction game where the combination of pieces bought are scored according to an easy to follow on board chart.  Built in timing over 3 epochs adds some suspense and having the highest amount of money does not guarantee victory.  Addictive.

Same rating as for Razzia. I played 4-6 games against a computer verison in the last few days. This game is really good. Currently I'm not sure if the Disaster tile are so important that this make a better game than Razzia. This game is really strategic. There is only 2 things you can do on your turn and each decision is always important. When playing against real opponent (no AI) it is really important that all players call Ra at the right time else a set might be too good.

A cursory look at this game might make you think this is a light luck-dominated game, but make no mistake this is an excellent auction game.  Balancing all the different scoring methods, avoiding losing points here and trying to gain points here, makes a wonderfully tight game, where you have to agonize over whether you are getting enough for you biggest bid.  Many things to consider but only so much you can do to affect your position, the amount of strategic depth is limited (though there is some), you are often just looking to make the best of what you get and hope that is enough.  The luck of the draw does come into it, as is to be expected in a game where tiles are pulled out randomly, and no player can expect to win every time, but a good player will generally do well.

RATING: 8
"Ra" is a simple game.  That being said, there is some awesome fun in this box.  It is full of press-your-luck auctions, dynamic bidding positions, and the "epoch" is steadily but surely running down as sand in an hourglass.  Experienced players have a nose for when to invoke "Ra", based on an opponents bidding ability, and the relative value of the "pot".  This causes interesting interaction, putting stress on an opponent with perhaps stronger bidding power but fewer remaining bids.  There is definitely a gambling factor, and randomness of the draw pile, so not to be taken too seriously.  But this game can be hilarious.  Skilled players will win consistently over newer players.

The beauty of this game comes from the simple mechanics, which never the less lead to excruciating decisions for each player.  Newbies who lose their bidding power right away may suffer unfortunate down-time as they wait to join in again at the next epoch.  

Along with Tigris & Euphrates, Ra is among Knizia's best board games.  Also one of the best iOS apps out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
What a strange game.  Curiously dry, willfully random, but a deep strategic exercise.  Would need more experience with it to truly fix on what it is.  It's not that it's fun, but I can see how it might be fun, though that vision feels like it's glimpsed through a thick fog and several refracting mirrors.  My guess is that becoming good at it develops a kind of zen intuition as far as how and where to play your oh-so-limited bids.  Not my game, I don't think, but fascinating in its way.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game simplifies the decisions you have to make on your turn (pull tile or call Ra, bid or don't bid), but it overcomplicates the scoring. This makes it very hard to know your position in the game at any time. I also think it makes the gameplay less interesting. I like lots of choices and don't like the bid tiles. Despite what I don't like about this game, I still consider it a good game and would play it again.

A Reiner Knizia auction game where you are pulling tiles and bidding on them by calling Ra.  You have a fixed bids on Ra tiles that number from 1 to 16.

Very family friendly although the scoring can be a little tricky for new players to understand.

Unfortunately the nearer a game is to a pure auction game, the less likely I am to like it. Played Ra a number of times, each time hoping to see what others see in it, but pure auction games feel like all the hard work with none of the fun.  Can't criticise anything in particular about this one; just doesn't press my buttons.  Much rather play Amun Re or Power Grid where the auctions are integral but not all there is.

Auction game with random tile-draw. Though, what makes the game fun is the tension as to if/when to bid for a tile-lot. (Different tile-combinations yield  /- victory points.)

9/2006 Update: Rating down a notch.  Medici, also by Knizia, is a comparable auction game, though much better.

11/2007 Rating up a ontch :) This is still an exciting game after all these years.  There's a lot more going on there than in Medici; although the latter is purer.

One of the best bidding games I have played. The typical Knizia scoring system makes it possible to have a few basic strategies but in large it is tactical decissions in relation to what bidding tiles you hold that decides the outcome of the game. 

It plays quickly with low downtime,even with 5 players, since the number of actions to take each turn is very low and fast. 

Scales well between 3 and five players but requires different tactics and strategies dependent of the number of players. 

Very high player interaction level and lots of fun and great replayabillity.

A relatively fast and easy-to-play game. The strategy seems to be subtle, requiring several plays to grasp, but the game itself can be learned very quickly. The limited bid auction mechanic makes this game feel in someways similar to Metropolys, and I'm not sure yet which game I'll end up preferring.

Only a couple of plays, but we love this game so far. I don't usually like bidding games, but this version is really great, since there is only one bid and you know what everyone else has to play with. I love the dynamic of including the last winning tile in the bidding - allowing you to set yourself up for the next round. The game seems to play better with more people.

Classic Knizia auction game.  There's a lot of luck (in fact, I consider this a Push Your Luck type game), but very balanced with meaningful choices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Very approachable game as easy to teach, but plenty of subtlety for more advanced gamers.  I have never met anyone who does not say "Hey!  Let's play that again."  The quick time to play and multiple scoring paths are a blast when combined with the short game time (failed risks do not damage you for too long --> 1 game down, let's play again v. 4 hours of finishing a losing position in some other game).

One quibble...the ultimate hosing of drawing a RA tile just after a RA bid...now you may lose a good sun for a crappy sun and maybe even have your turn end.  There is simply nothing you can do about it and you may take a ton of negative points if you have not protected yourself with pharoahs and civilization tiles.  (Guess how my last game went!)

Ra is an auction and set-collection game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase lots of tiles with their bidding tiles. Once a player has used up his or her Suns, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three "epochs" (rounds). The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play.

While I appreciate how well it is crafted together, Ra somehow does not appeal to me. One factor is how the luck of the draw forces you into situations where you have to take a bad deal to prevent another player from making a good one, another is the big and almost completely useless board.
Played 5+ times.

RATING: 8
I don't normally enjoy pure bidding games.  However, I think I enjoy this one because everybody starts with only 3 bidding tiles.  There is a lot of open information that allows you to quickly evaluate what the current lot may be worth to your opponents.  Add on the fact that you also know which sun tiles they have available compared to you and you can really put them in some tough positions.  One of the best things about the game is how simple your actual options are on your turn - either call Ra or draw a tile.  Instead of being bogged down by rules or game options, you spend your time analyzing the current game state.  Very elegant!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(Played only with 5 players)

A unique auction game with weird mechanics, including push-your-luck element. Works greatly.

Every player has three (and only three) opportunities to buy tiles, regardless of value of their sun tokens. Plus, it is hard to know value of tiles exactly. Furthermore, no one knows whetther the value of tiles would go up or down. Consequently, you can get good tiles even if you have only sun tokens with lower numbers, if you bid with proper timing.

Generally I don't like convoluted scoring much, but it works great here. Convoluted scoring makes estimation of value of tiles harder, and game play more unpredictable.

Unique auction system and complicated scoring gives you some control, and makes this game much more fascinating and intriguing than other simpler auctions games and other simpler push-your-luck games.

I coincide with that said by Greg Schloesser: turn actions are very limited, boring, repetitive, take the tile in less than 1 second until one player calls for an auction. Stop: think something and again, all the players...take the tile, etc......stop....auction....Very boring.
  
In fact I was the one in charge of taking out the tiles. My hand always in the bag and asking: Tile?, yes, tile?, yes and so on.Sometimes i make the question but before the answer the tile was put in the board, asuming an obvious answer. And i never was wrong in my assumptions. 

  During the same week that we learned Ra we were learning Santiago and Tower of Babel. What a difference! 
  
Very basic, primitive, and simple auction game. Sincerely I don't understand how it is among the TOP 300 of the BGG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A solid 8.  I really enjoy the bidding system, and it's always interesting to see how the different lots available for bid, the number of "Ra" tiles that have come up, and each player's available suns will interact to affect when an auction gets called and what folks will bid.

Would be higher, but it's just a little dry for some tastes.  And I have had it fall flat in a group a time or two.  But the game plays fast enough that I've never really felt like I didn't get the appropriate payoff for the time invested.

I highly recommend the player aid available here (the  individual player mats that assist in organizing purchased tiles and in visualizing how the scoring works).  They're priceless, and should have been included with the game.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Early impressions are postive.  Lots and lots of painful choices about when to call auctions and what to bid.  An auction game so unlike his others that it seems like a different genre altogether. UPDATE:  Is this game better than Modern Art?  I'm not sure, but it seems to be approaching it's brilliance with each additional play. UPDATE 2:  It's hard to imagine a superior pure auction game... no strategy seems dominant but many seem reasonable.

Likes:
- The components are nice.
- Very clever idea of bidding not only for reward (tiles), but also for the very means of bidding itself (suns).

Dislakes:
- It's kinda boring, despite good mechanics.
- It's strongly luck-dependent.
- You do very little in your turn while at the same time you really don't need to negotiate with others (like e.g. in Modern Art). So you end up feeling little involved in the game.

"Wait, this is a game?" That was my thought after watching a video review of it. After playing it, I would like to say, "Yes Virginia, there is a game in there." Oh, there's absolutely no theme outside of similar images being used on the game pieces. Has other pet peeve things like getting points for having three of a certain item. Somehow a flood is a good thing, but too many floods doesn't do anything negative.

The auction aspect is its saving grace. It took about midway through the game before my brain even began to process correctly what was going on. After that the beauty of the game took over. I wanted to hate this game, and if I had continued on my path, I would have. It had somehow worked its way into my brain and made me think about it even the next day. It might be a one trick pony, but it's one hell of a pony. I fear more plays will only make my rating go up.

Played at DaveCon 2012.

Rating Potential: 7.5-8.5. I think moving up is asking a lot though. If there was any sort of theme implemented properly in this game, it would go to a 9.

RATING: 7.5
Initially Ra didn't do much for me.  

For me, the enjoyment of this game depends more on the enjoyment of my opponents.  That's of course true in a lot of games but it seems to matter more in Ra.

It's a fast moving game and you do feel involved in the flow since your turn lasts such a short amount of time. If your opponents don't go into brain lock as to whether to call Ra or pull a tile, then you'll have fun. Otherwise... yuck.

The last auction or two each round lend too much "push your luck" for the type of game this purposes to be.  Since I am not an Alea collector, the only reason I still have this game is because my wife liked it.

My new favorite auction game.  It's very strategic, but easy to learn.  The fact that you don't shuffle tiles between rounds really helps the game flow well.  I also enjoy the push-your-luck element when you are trying to decide whether or not to invoke Ra.

I like the theme and the board, components and rulebook are nice. But I hate primary auction mechanics (this was a gift). Worse, the push your luck component on the last bid is fairly annoying. It is replayable and no bash the leader aspect really, but it’s just not a hit for me.

The auction element is well-implemented as players can easily evaluate their bid relative to other players capacities without resorting to arithmetic.  I like how well this scales from 3 to 5 players.  When I've played recently, my friends have not been too enthralled by the theme.

I held off buying or trying this one for the longest time. Silly me. I was put off by the description as a pure auction game. I just didn't think that would appeal to me at all, I'm not fond of math, or having to keep track of such things in a game. I was wrong. This is amazing fun. Not very hard to grasp the concepts, but far more difficult to do well.

Seemingly simple, yet it is a tense and strategic game. What can I say; I am a sucker for auction games. Very fun and great player interaction with the right group! The scoring is a P.I.T.A., but the legend on the board and the player mat (here on BGG) helps keep track of the sets needed to score. I don't love the theme/artwork (I know, I know... what theme!?), but this one has a spot in my heart as my introduction to Knizia. I will rarely turn down a game!

All the tiny tiles were so daunting, I put it away for a month after punching everything out.  Finally opened it back up when I had a few hours to spare, and found that it took less than 15 minutes to read through the rules and discover what I'd been missing.  The play flows and if you're thwarted with one strategy, you can always go for victory from a different angle.  Good stuff.

Ra is a lot of fun.  The scoring mechanism gives each card a different determinant of value that you need to keep in mind when you bid.  There is also a strategy about using all your bids before someone else and the possibility of Ra coming up once too often.

Highly recommended.

[i]Ra[/i] is my favorite game of the 60+ I have played thus far.  It combines two of my favorite mechanics, bidding and set collection, in a unique way that involves a lot of player interaction.  The game is short (45-60 minutes) and easy to learn, and has a nice skill/luck blend that makes it quite re-playable.

Just as in poker, your options each turn are few, yet it is difficult to determine which is optimal.  Knowing whether to call Ra, draw a tile, or play a God tile requires an understanding not only of the probabilities involved, but also the psychology of your opponents (a trait found in many of Knizia's games).  It really is a combination of math/art, and playing frequently with the same group enhances one's enjoyment of the game.

[i]Ra[/i] is enjoyable with 3-5 players (I have yet to play with two).  Most will find it best with 3 or 4.  I rate the game a 9.5-10 with 3 players and a 9-9.5 with 4-5 players.  I wouldn't be surprised if my rating changes to a 10 at some point, but I would prefer to play more games first.

Edit - I have now played [i]Ra[/i] with two players and I rate it a 9.  It is still a great game, but I believe the luck factor might be a bit higher than in a 3-4 player game.

My favorite auction style game.  I seem to very often fall into a trap where I am the last player with bidding tokens.  I really need to adjust my strategy more.  My only complaint with the Alea edition is the lack of information on the tiles.  It would have been really easy to include a symbol for wether or not you keep the tile from epoch to epoch... this is the hardest thing for new players.

Between 01/31/06 and 03/02/16 I've played 23 times; fairly evenly divided between 3, 4, and 5-player games. I'm glad we played the first time (using the original version) with a display cheat sheet. Otherwise I'd have been lost. A pleasant game that scales well from 3 to 5 players. 
The mechanics work very well. I enjoy the game's Egyptian atmosphere. Yet the theme is obviously pasted on, as some of it has no basis in reality. Examples: What are "suns"? What are Ra tiles? What are the pharaoh tiles? They can't be the actual pharaoh, as there are oodles of them. Who/what do the players represent? So, just play the game and don't think too much about the theme or it'll drive you crazy.

Wow, I really liked this game the first time I played it and now I just love it.  This game does a great job of building tension at the end of each round (epoch) of the game.  I find myself playing it cool in the beginning, waiting for the perfect lot, and then out of no where I'm scrambling for a lot full of crap because I'm afraid of those damn RA tiles ending the round.  The fact that there's no language barrier to this game is another reason my being excited about this game, I can see my parents (native Spanish speakers) being REALLY into this.

Another game of interesting abstract concepts from the master of throw away Euros. 

I wonder if Knizia has ever read any background for a theme that has been tacked onto any game that he's ever created?? Or has it ever been the case where the theme for a game has come before the mechanics?? I don't think so...

But the mechanics save this one.

It's a bidding game, but it has the tension of a betting game...

Usually a blast to play with 3 & 4 players. Not fun with 2, and not so much with 5.

Print out the player aid here on the geek, and it's easy explained & played with newbies as well.

It's amazing how such a simple set of rules can produce such a strategically deep and fun game.  The auctioning mechanism works very well with the game and definitely makes for some truly unique gameplay.

It's a reasonable game, of which I'd tire if I played it too often. I'd give it a 7, but the novelty and beauty of it merit a bump to 8. There are aspects of Ra that I really like, and others that mildly annoy me. One notable positive is the "sun tile" auction, because there is more to consider than "zero balance/expectation" in decision making. The "chicken" aspect is also quite interesting. 

There should be some check on the player's ability to call an auction at any time. In some games, people "Ra" too frequently and it becomes disruptive.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Lightly-themed auction game of set collecting where players randomly grab what goes up on the auction block.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: Streamlines auctions in a way that is simple and fast moving yet retains hard, game-altering choices. Best of all, it doesn't take a half dozen plays to get the game understood so that it runs within its suggested playtime (less then 1 hour) and one that people will be willing/wanting to give a second go back-to-back.

Cons: The theme doesn't cover up the fact it's an interactive math problem. Really all it does is make it a prettier game to play-- that's it. Games can be close enough that a little string of unfortunate luck can feel like a big deal. Seems to be the type of game you forget about if you don't play it for a while.

Other: I've read other people say that this game loses its interest after the first 15 or so plays. I didn't think that would be true for me initially as I saw it shoot into my top 5 games for a while. Then it just sort of happened... it disappeared from the rotation of games getting played and I didn't really care. I still think it's a great game and an example of how to make auctions great without the need for heavy number crunching, but it just lost that edge it had for me.

Best Use: When you want to maximize interesting decisions in a short amount of time with a smaller group.

I think I liked this pretty well, and I wasn't expecting to. Play time is reasonable, the scoring system is fairly easy to grasp and there appear to be a lot of viable strategies.

It's a good combination of easy to get into but difficult to master. The fact that a given lot might be great for you good for someone else and bad for someone else make bidding quite interesting. I really like the swapping out of the sun tiles after an auction win. I like the way that smaller sun tiles are sneaky useful in certain situations. I like that you sometimes find yourself weighing whether to go ahead and buy a lot that has a disaster tile in it. I like that you can try to force another player's hand or dare another player to overpay for something.

I'm not big on Eurogames, but I like this better than most I've tried. I give it a 5 because I'm not likely to ask to play, but I'll probably be willing to play occasionally if asked.

Excrutiating choices, great chance to press your luck and tempt others.  The mix between immediate scoring and end of game scoring is perfect.  Probably Knizoa's best game.

There are many ways to win in this game, and players are rarely out of it at the beginning. I love the asynchronous scoring opportunities, the way you have to weigh what you are bidding with not only the tiles you will win but with the sun you will get back for next round AND with the value of the lot to other opponents. Just a great game all around! And this is the only auction game I've played where calling for an auction can be an offensive, forcing move to other players. Plus, this game is fun with 2 players.

Dry and abstract. Players are bidding for points, straight-up. There isn't any nuance like Medici where you have to consider both the end of round bonus and the specific category you're buying... in Ra it's just points. This is a one-dimensional risk management game; I can see why it would appeal to some but this is not my cup of tea by a long shot.

RATING: 8.5
A Knizia auction game which as per usual has multiple ways to score.  In Ra there are about 15 ways to score with straights, sets, negative points for not collecting certain items, end-of-round and end-game scoring, etc.  The money is tight, and similar to the money in For Sale, where players are given just 4 bidding values to use each round.  The money you bid with is recycled and added to the next auction (although when you win money in an auction you cannot use it 'til the next round).  There's some chance in this one as you're trying collect items that may never come up.  Players must diversify, keep track of what their opponents are collecting & set themselves up for scoring opportunities.

Well, yes. Solid, lasts about as long as it should, decent player interaction without too much AP. Despite all the familiar elements, I have really no reference points for this.

This is a fun game that I have been wanting for a while now.  Somebody happened to have it at my FLGS on game night so I finally got a chance to try it out.  It made me want it even more.  I'll be buying this game when it comes back in print sometime in August, hopefully it doesn't get pushed back any more.

In Ra players bid for tiles that are being drawn to score the most points.  Okay, so there is this whole Egyptian theme and all, but really you can paste in about any theme you want.  To me it really doesn't have much to do with the game.  The game is played over 3 rounds, sorry epochs.  After each round all tiles you have collected are scored, except for the monuments which only score at the end of the game.  Some of the tiles you keep throughout the epochs, others are thrown out after scoring.

I think what I like most about this game is the auction.  To me it is new and I don't know of another game that does this, although there might be some.  You have 3 Ra pieces with numbers on them.  Those are the values you have to bid during an auction.  So if I have the numbers 3, 7, and 12, those are the only 3 bids I can offer.  The bidding is also a once round bid, so if you are first bidder you have a tough choice to make sometimes.  Also, when you make a bid, there is another Ra piece in the middle of the board, you have to place your bid there, and take the one that is already there.  Those new pieces you take are your bidding options for the next epoch, so that also factors into the decision.

The tiles you are bidding on are drawn randomly from a bag, some are good, some destroy your other tiles.  This is another interesting twist in the game.  There might be some really good stuff up there, but there might be some disasters as well.

I give this game a solid 8.  It is a lot of fun, and although the tiles coming out are pure luck, you still have to plan with your bids as to what you are willing to take.  The auction mechanic alone is very interesting to me.  Of course Knizia has to come up with weird ways to score, luckily, at least in the version we played with, all the needed information is printed plainly around the board.

One of the best designed auction games that I've played and my favourite game from Knizia's Auction Trilogy.  A classic.

I've owned both the Rio Grande/Alea and the Uberplay edition.  Much prefer the Uberplay edition due to the compact box, thicker tiles and the user friendly graphics that act as mnemonics during gameplay, thereby improving the game's accessibility.

Best played with 3 players imo (OK with 4p, and alright with 5p, due to decreased control).

My all time favorite.  Ra simplifies the bidding mechanic by giving players fixed bids.  This rachets up the tension as you must decide whether to take tiles (and lose bids) or risk losing the tiles.  In addition, unlike most bidding games, not everything in play in Ra will be auctioned.  Players must decide when to call auctions, and that decision is the game's most important.  Finally, the complex scoring system allows for many possible winning strategies.  Ra is a masterpiece.

I now feel like I've tuned in to this game. I don't have a clearly-defined system, but I know intuitively how to value tiles, and based on my suns and the number of Ras left, what value I should call Ra on and when I should wait for more. Since I feel like the learning process has stopped, that makes me less excited to play this one.

Played once.  This is an auction game where luck (which items are drawn) and tactics (when and how much to bid) both weigh heavily.  Players bid for items using one of three chips (from a set numbered 1-16) they have; the winning bidder gets all the items up for auction, but leaves their chip on the board and takes whatever chip is currently on the board (thus adding much complexity to bidding).  Scoring is complex, but easily understandable and interestingly designed.  Overall this is a fun game that has a bit too much luck for my taste (but is still thought-provoking enough to be enjoyable).   As with most Knizia games, I got to watch all the other players zoom ahead of me (but had grand fun doing it).

I’m finding that I’m not a really big fan of most of Reiner Znizia’s designs. Generally speaking, his designs are elegant and simple. However, I find that some of the game play elements in his titles are a little fiddly and usually have many unnecessarily steps and rules that complicate matters. Also, as many have noticed, the themes of his collections feel tacked on. 

I am also of the mind that a purely auction driven game, gets old fast without some other element to help it along. So, going in, “Ra” was already in “probation” from me. I picked up this title based on the strength of its reviews, which is quite substantial. I just had to see what all the fuss is about. At fist the rules seemed over complicated but once we got in the groove of things, as with most games, it became much, much simpler and the game revealed itself. Admittedly, this game was better than what I had expected but certainly not in the leagues of “Puerto Rico,” Caylus” or even “Carcassone.” The game itself is a simple auction game where players bid, using a clever sun mechanism, for tiles which earn them points after each “Epoch.” The player with the most points wins, naturally. Some strategy involved in timing when to use your sun tokens to make a bid, which is the extra little twist in this game. As usual for Knizia, there’s a little scoring math that has to be done but it seems pretty easy to pick up, explain and play. If you like auction games then give it a try, otherwise play “Ra” if you want something meatier than “For Sale.”

Buy tiles in auction to improve your dynasty for most points.

Plays: More than a dozen.
Type: Auction/trading game = a game where you bid or trade for victory points.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: 3-4.
Playing time: 45 mins.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – tiles. Auctions.
Randomness: Low – tile draw, but you decide what set of tiles to bid on.

Replayability: High. This is one those rare "simple yet deep" games.
Fun: For a number crunching game, this is surprisingly fun, probably because the auctions make it highly interactive. Calling “Ra!” is also fun and something every gamer should get to experience.
Memorability: Low, it’s a VP engine that doesn’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Nice.

Who will like this: Family gamers that want to do a bit more thinking.

This is one of the best (the best?) auction games I've played. The mechanisms are ridiculously simple and can be explained in a few minutes. However, the game is wonderfully difficult to play well. The game is "light", but it's unforgiving and punishes slight miscalculations. Wonderful stuff.

Bumped up to 8 after a cluster of satisfying recent plays. A very good game with a thin veneer of a theme, rather chaotic but still lots of fun. The playmats available here at the BGG are a must (can't believe they didn't come with the game!). I'm not a big fan of purely auction games, but this one works for me: the once-around bidding is tricky and enjoyable (somewhat similar to Medici in this regard); the system for exchanging bidding tiles is very clever. Works well with three players, even two. [23 plays]

Can be really broken, though, if the tiles aren't mixed thoroughly. There's a strong tendency for the Ra tiles to accumulate at the top of the bag game after game.

Great auction game that has a 'chicken-run' concept to it ('Shall I turn another tile?'). The sun-exchange system gives nice possibilities. Too bad the scoring is so 'Knizia' making it difficult to see what the worth of a tile is at a certain point in the game.

UPDATE: After giving this some more plays and some more thought, it starts to fall flat for me. The luck of tile draw and thus value of the bid and possible early end of the round, is getting to be to important to make it really fun. Rating dropped from 8 to 6

An interesting mix of push your luck, auctions, and set collection. Really tense when it gets down to the end of an epoch and you still need a flood tile.

RATING: 7.5
A fine little push-your-luck auction game.  Bid values are limited by sun tiles, auctions can be forced by ra tiles or by other players calling ra and choices are limited by what you pull from the bag: in all these ways, a lot of the tension of the game comes from not being able to do exactly what you wan or need to do.  So you're always waiting for something to happen: sometimes you get lucky; usually, you don't.  This dynamic is mildly interesting.  No Thanks does push-you-luck better.  Biblios does auctions & press-your-luck in a more streamlined fashion that gives player more agency and control.

This might just be the best - and definitely most accessible - auction game there is. The theme is pasted-on, but why not Egypt... and the rules are VERY well-balanced. The idea of "sun paid by me becomes a property of the player who wins auction after mine" is especially clever, creating another strategic thing to watch out for.

In short, rarely there is a game providing so much space for decisions on so little rules. Some say Knizia's masterpiece is Ingenious, Euphrat and Tigris etc.
For me, while those are a rock-solid games, this is really the peak of his work.
AND unlike Euphrat, this withstands the test of time.

I was a little apprehensive about playing Ra as a 2-player game, but I thought it worked really well! I'm still not entirely sure what the theme is -- something in ancient Egypt, I guess -- but it doesn't matter to me because the game is interesting & fun. It's pretty light, but there's some good decisions to be made throughout, and I'm sure there's enough variability in the how the tiles come out to keep this game interesting for a number of plays.

Fast-paced yet interesting game of competitive push-your-luck. Has the usual knizia hallmarks. I like the sun value mechanic, which is an innovative twist on the auction/opportunity cost problem. It is a feature similarly applied in Hollywood Blockbuster and it worked well in that game, too. I get a bit tired of seeing the usual knizia game element of rewarding players who have the highest bidding currency at the end of the game (eg High Society, Taj Mahal, etc) because it seems like a distraction from the main game, but that's just me. Also, Ra Is a bit too random to take seriously but fun if you accept that skill won't guarantee a win. Good time killer although it's a bit meatier than what I would consider to be a "filler".

This is my first Euro bidding game, and so far I love it.  This game is so different than any game I own.  I love it when this one hits the table, even if there is a little "luck" factor in the game (namely pulling Ra tiles out of the bag), but that should not be confused with strategy....sometimes not bidding can be a powerful thing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What struck me about Ra is that it's a very simple game to teach. One practice game and I was able to learn and teach the game with little difficulty. Among all the very highly rated games on BGG this would have to be one of the most fundamentally simple games of them all. 

You have 3 simple choices each turn... Call RA which starts an auction, draw a tile which adds to the auction track or use a God tile which enables you to take a tile from the auction track and place it into your area. The mechanisms in this game are dead simple and this certainly deserves it's reputation as THE gateway auction game. The tactics and the strategies in the game take a bit longer to grok but even after a few games I can see there is certainly some subtlety to the auction process. Knowing when to bid and when to call Ra is a balancing act... your actions and how you bid depends heavily on how many large Sun value tiles are still in reserve in other players areas. Some rounds go very quickly with many Ra tiles being called whereas others develop into extended point fests with a large number of great tiles in auction after auction. 

I can see why some feel this game is luck driven and while I agree there is luck... certainly that is mitigated by prudent bidding and the fact that you can often get a high numbered sun tile in return for using a lower numbered sun tile to win an auction for something others didn't really want to pay up for... their loss, your gain. There is certainly a look ahead mechanism in play here which enables you to set yourself up for future epochs even if you don't score big in the current one.

All in all the diversity of tactics you need to consider in Ra are remarkable considering the game mechanisms are dead simple. Again, this is clearly a game that has a very efficient, lean design... an extremely low amount of chrome and a pasting on of theme... but the underlying strong structure of the design allows the gameplay to maintain a brisk pace while everyone pursues their various options to try and achieve a victory by scoring the most fame points.

After all that praise... I have to say this is probably the hardest time I've ever had coming up with a rating for a game. It is solid, decent game but am I having fun? Somewhat. Am I enjoying auction after auction after auction? Somewhat. Do I feel like replaying this often? Not really. This may change with further play but right now I waver between this being a 5, 6 or 7 in the ratings. I believe there are elements of all three of those ratings in Ra... it IS a good game, I will only play it sporadically and it can be slightly boring. On any given day it will range from a 5 to a 7 and sometimes even slightly above that if the session was reasonably interesting and slightly below that if the overly lean, almost skeletal structure of the auction process is allowed to poke its bones through too sharply... making the game too dry and repetitious for its own good.

I rate it a 6 currently and that's maybe a bit high. Time will tell but this could easily drop a half point or rise by a similar measure but the average of my feelings is a 6 currently. That such an efficient and clean design can sometimes feel too simple and sterile is not a surprise I suppose coming from Knizia and his mathematical background... but in Ra it seems to show itself more starkly than in some of his other games it seems to me. 

Ra possibly would have been better as part of another game with 1 or 2 other meshing mechanisms to help it bridge the gap to make it more complex and interesting and not "just" an auction game. Maybe I just need to play it more and really appreciate it for the "classic" design that it is. Time will tell... but my gut feeling right now is that like the monuments depicted on the tiles of Ra... the game may well be a classic but at the same time it's also a dry and weathered specimen from the past.

A classic auction game that's very simple, yet have all those decision moments that other games have to invent complex mechanisms to accomplish. Initiate bidding when the pool is valuable enough for you (or before it gets too valuable for your opponents) or press your luck and pass. Offer bid tiles to build combinations but also consider the bid tile you get in return as it puts you in a better or worse position next epoch. So deep and yet so smooth and simple and a great introduction to non-gamers.

Ra is a game I used to like 10 years ago. Since then it stayed a long time on the shelf, because I have a lot of other games to play. 
I remember I liked the game, especially the fact that it is an open game: no hidden elements here. You can always compare your own position to that of your opponents and adapt your tactics to it.

Now, years later the game felt a bit disappointing. I  have multiple explanations for this change in feel about Ra. Maybe it's because some fellow players just didn't find it their cup of tea and unintentionally took away the fun of the game. Maybe my preference changed overtime. The game now feels a little too abstract to me (I don't really like abstract games). The best reason I can find is that in the meantime I simply discovered a lot of games that are just more fun!

It isn't a bad game though and it has the advantage of a short game length and it is pretty quick to learn.

Ra is a real achievement in game design.  It has such simple mechanics, but they offer so many unusual twists on the standard auction game that the game really seems unlike any other.  Perhaps my favorite aspect is that, as part of the auction lot, you are bidding on the sun that was used to win the previous lot.  Ra also packs a great deal of strategy and tactics into a really short playtime, such that it is the densest game I own, in terms of depth per playing time.

Ra can be prone to some crazy circumstances, due to the way the tiles come out of the bag, but these fluke occurences don't bother me that much.  The fact that they happen actually serves to keep you on your toes as your playing.  You never know exactly what will happen, and just because only 2 ra tiles have been pulled, that doesn't mean that the epoch will continue for much longer.  Ra is a wonderful game, and I would gladly play it just about any time.

Overall Comment: a different kind of auction game where players compete for tiles to add to their collections, these tiles gain the players points if sets of the same or different are collected. There is nothing else to this game other than the bidding.

Ratings:
Initial(wow factor): 7 (not much to look at)
Family: 8 (everyone will play this one but it is not requested much anymore except by the young ones)
Game group: 7 (filler play only)
AP: 8 (not much slow down once players are familiar with the tiles)
Solo play: not yet developed

When purchased: 2007
Recommend expansions: none available
Age range: 6+
Luck factor(1-10high): 7 (drawing tiles from a bag)

Reason purchased: Geek analysis and looking for a good gateway game

Pros: plays quick and is somewhat interesting, better than playing cards with a group of adults but has the same feel, conversation during play
Cons: same everytime (just like cards)

Recommendation: if you like cards then this should work for you, not much to think about and the turns go quick. An adult game night with RA is usually good fun.
Replay rating: Below average
Game value (plays/cost ratio): above average (played very heavily initially and the game group latched onto it - excellent time filler game.

Knizia's auction game in ancient Egypt. Everyone is seeded with 3 bid tokens, with different values. Bid on pharohs, monuments, gods, water, civilization tokens, etc. Being a Kniza game, there are many ways to earn points (or lose them) Not being a huge fan of bidding games, it took me 4 or 5 games to catch on this game. I really enjoy this game now and it is my favourite of all the auction games out there. It is a very tense, strategic and subtle game. There will be tough decisions on when to invoke Ra.

Bidding system game where you bid on pieces.  You have to collect certain pieces each turn to avoid penalties while trying to collect points.  People tend to have a bit of trouble keeping track of what they need to get for what kinds of points.  Printing out cheat sheets (play mats) for this makes it easier.

I obtained this rather late (2003). Since then, I really enjoy the game. It has a clever auction mechanics i.e. initiating auction, distinct bidding tiles and bidding for future auction power together with well-thought multiple-way-to-the-victory scoring system. First the scoring system seemed rather cumbersome but in fact it is very easy once I understand what will be kept throughout the game. (people explained to me didnt emphersize this so i was totally lost first. Now I make sure everyone understand temporal and permanent tiles when I teach this to new plaers...) Anyway it is really a great game and should be re^published as a card game soon.

Kicked butt the first time I played.  The player aid mats available on BGG are essential. Play is quick, and intereactive with people frantically gambling against the coming of Ra.  The random interval auction system is plenty of fun.  Looking forward to a reprint

My first Auction-type game and it was great. Weighing the point chips against your opponents options, trying to get the "good" ones before auction runs out, there is an excellent complexity to Ra's rules that is carefully balanced by the gameplay.

Solid auction game, albeit one in which you're in no danger of being overwhelmed by the variety of options.  I like it, and I prefer it to Modern Art, but I don't quite see what the big deal is.  The comparatively neglected Medici is my favorite of Knizia's pure auction games.

Enjoyed, but didn't love, my first play, after being very excited on reading the rules.  Will give this more plays before deciding which way the rating will move . . .

Edit:  After more plays, I do enjoy this clever auction game.  Not my favorite, but will continue to hit the table.

Edit:  And with further plays, it becomes clear why this is a classic.  It is a shame that this game rarely get suggested, because it always satisfies.

RATING: 9.2
An ingenious bidding system (players receive fixed value tiles and a limited number of possible won auctions) combines with an ingenious selection of goods up for bids (not only tiles that vary in value greatly depending on circumstances, but you're also bidding on a bidding tile for the next round). Not Knizia's "purest" game, but possibly his game that best combines clever yet simple mechanics with a great sense of tension and fun. More dynamic than any other auction game I can think of.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A game I like more each time I play it and with any number of players. The player mats here on the Geek are a great aid and help to enhance the enjoyment of the game. In fact, the group I currently play with had given up on Ra after it first came out, but I really wanted to play so they agreed to give it another shot. The different dynamic of players, as well as the help of the mats, was enough for them to now appreciate and really like the game. Ra... Ra... RA... RA... RA! **UPDATE** While I still really love Ra, I had to drop the rating to a 9. The game is just too dependent on all of the players knowing and liking the game. With beginners or disinterested parties, things become a bit too random.

One game my wife is always willing to play.  Auctioning game in a sense.  You place items on the board and when you find the sweet spot you start an auction to buy the items.  A lot of fun but I always feel like my fate is a bit too out of my hands.  I don't like that the luck of the draw can play such a heavy influence on the game.

RATING: 7
Ra is a remarkably simple game. Other than how the tiles affect scoring, there is little to for new players to learn. Decisions on one's turn is limited to either bet on the existing row of tiles or draw a new tile to add to it.

On the downside, the Egyptian theme is as flimsy as can be, offering little more than images for the tiles to carry. Also, this 2nd edition's tiles are somewhat hard to distinguish due to murky colors and artwork. For all the garish primary colors the 1st edition had, at least one could tell the tiles apart from across the table.

So where is the engagement in Ra? Strangely enough its not in either of the main mechanics of Auction/Bidding and Set Collection, but rather in a Push-Your-Luck element created by when would be the best time to start an auction. As more tiles are placed in the auction row, interest, and tension builds.

All-in-all, Ra is a good game, but there are many I prefer over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Auction game where you are trying to collect certain tiles for the most points.  If there is a group on the board that will mostly benefit a certain player invoke Ra and force a bidding war to make that player pay!  All the while you want to be conscious of what other players bidding chips are at because you want to know when you can win.

Such great decisions to make with so few available actions... Ra improves with more gameplay.  This game needs to hit the table more often, and more than one player has been hooked on the 'press-your-luck' nature of being the 'last player standing'.

While the new tiles are great and almost remove the need for player aids, the bag included is far too small.  Thanks, but we're stacking them.

Ra is a very good auction game. I liked the [gameid=12589]'s theme better than Ra's but you can't go wrong playing either one. Components are superior in Ra but that also means the box is huge compared to [gameid=12589]'s. [gameid=12589] is a bit more calcutable and Ra has more of a gambler's feel because of the destruction tiles.

Update (26.11.2006): Rating from 8 to 9. Ra is definitely one of the best auction games. Can be played with non-gamers as well as gamers.

RATING: 9
Easy to teach, easy (and relatively quick) to play. Brilliant in that you are making a single decision on your turn and yet there are so many layers of strategy that surround that decision. I've taught this game to gamers and non gamers alike (most of which have never even heard of an auction game) and they have all loved it. An impressive feat for a game that is very weakly tied to it's theme.

RATING: 9
I like this game for a lot of reasons. It provides a very limited set of decisions that opens up into a very wide emergent interaction space. The fixed value sun tiles and single action limit (invoking Ra or drawing a new tile from the bag) force the players into a tight arena that allows them to deftly maneuver around the clever scoring system--and each other. 

I was surprised (stupidly, because I always find Knizia's big box games thematic) how much I got into the theme. The scoring of tiles at the end of the round is really rich in narrative, and it makes would otherwise be a complex euro metric easy to remember; Pharaohs fight for rulership, civilization building is required (and rewarded), the Nile farmland is prosperous (but only after floods), and so on. Just beautiful. 

This game also appears to me in a tactile way. I love grabbing the Ra idol and slamming it down on the table with a shout; I love thwacking my sun tiles down to bid. I love trading in god tiles; I love collecting my auction winnings by sliding them off the board. The game provides a certain sequence of somatic (and verbal: "RA!") actions that just appeal to my simian sapience.

RATING: 8
A tense, yet fun game of bidding and taking risks, that usually moves pretty quickly with little downtime.  Has the perfect amount of random chance, in my book.  I enjoy playing this game even when I'm not doing particularly well :)

Why an "8" rating and not a "9"?  Because new players often draw tiles recklessly and refuse to start auctions, which can throw the game to the players that follow them in turn order.  The unusually low ratings from some geeks are probably due to the fact that some people don't understand a key strategy in this game: that players with low valued bidding tiles aren't powerless -- they always have the option to start auctions and force other players to make difficult decisions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very round offering, Ra brings yet another interesting couple of twists to auction games: throughout three eras players bid for tiles that will be collected in sets for later scoring, but they don't come in fixed lots - each turn a new tile can be added, or the auction can be called (or triggered by a special tile). Plus, bids are made only with a single chip out of the modest pool a player gets for each era. The winning chip will replace a chip open for all to see, that will belong to the auction winner only for scoring purposes.

It takes a couple of plays to get truly acquainted with the scoring system (balanced but a bit messier than Modern Art, for instance). Once this is done, Ra offers interesting decisions at a leisurely pace and resorting to very little material; after overloading things a bit with Euphrat & Tigris Knizia was sticking clearly to his guns on this one.

I played this for the first time after introducing our group to Medici the week prior. Gosh, I waited two years for this?! After hearing all the great things about "best auction game ever" I was sorely let down. The auctions were never tense - since usually only 1 or 2 players were in a position to both benefit from AND win the auction - and the scoring was complicated enough that it was difficult to appropriately value the tiles in play, even for the analytical memebers of our group. Compare that to Medici where nearly every bid would lead to groans from the next player (meaning a great bid!) and relative values of cards would continue to diverge for players as they specialized in commodities (resulting in tough decision on whether to jack up the price or let them have it). For us Medici was way better.

It's a really great game, but the latest reprint is plain garbage. The art is passable, but it's non functional, because you can't easily tell the tiles apart. The tiles do not fit in the bag and it is impossible to shuffle them in the bag, which is very important in this game. You can't close the box without throwing away the useless insert. On top of it all, it costs almost $50. Overall, very disappointed. 
The game itself is very good and is deeper than it seems. Not as good with 2, 3-4 players is the sweet spot.

[b]Ra[/b] was traded away in a math trade 10/5/15. (Received Elysium)
Received in a math trade (11/10/14).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]For a time this had become my favorite auction game (replacing Knizia's Medici), but has since been replaced by Modern Art (another Knizia classic). Out of the 3 I still think this is the easiest for new players to grasp, especially since everyone has bidding tiles so it is really hard to completely mess up the economy of the game, where as in a game like Modern Art a really bad bid can hand someone the game. There is also a lot of decisions to make in the tiles you decide to collect because there is no way you can do everything, and on top of that you can lose points if you fail to collect any tiles of certain groups. 

Ra ended up leaving my collection because my family had no interest in playing it and a lot of the other people I game with have copies. I still consider it an excellent game and one I am always willing to play. In my opinion Ra it is the closest to a gateway/family game when considering Knizia's auction games (I think For Sale is the best when considering other designers).[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Bidding tiles: obviously this is what makes the game. You can only bid with one of the 3 tiles you have in your hand which is extremely difficult since you may end up over paying for a group of tiles.
- Set collection: I always enjoy this mechanic in a game.
- Ra: Again there is a time crunch because once the Ra figure reaches the end of the track that round of bidding is over. This becomes especially stressful when yo are the only person pulling tiles/bidding at the end of a round [i](do I take another tile and chance getting nothing if I pull a Ra tile?)[/i].

This is an excellent game that I can see becoming a classic with more plays.
I am really looking forward to introducing this one to my family, I think it will be a great step up in auction games from For Sale.[/i]

Un clásico de subastas de Reiner Knizia, simple, elegante y lleno de decisiones interesantes. Con momentos de particular tensión y la dosis justa de aleatoriedad. Nunca te imaginaste invocando a "Ra!!" con tanto entusiasmo. En su momento me cansé de recomendarlo, cuando tenía una edición de un precio accesible. Ahora hay que debatirse entre copias de segunda mano y una nueva edición sobreproducida.

Estos títulos más viejos te hacen recordar la época en que los euros no necesitaban mil componentes y un arte sobreproducido para ser extraordinarios. La mecánica del Ra es elaborada sin ser complicada y su dinámica es atrapante sin ninguna pretensión temática.

Muy recomendable  8+

Great gateway game! Unique auction mechanic and tile collecting, make this...one outstanding medium weight game! This one doesn't come out all the time...but when it does it is always an enjoyable experience! Wonderful to show new gamers...not always their favorite (i.e. doesn't get requested again and again)...but, they never mind the game and appreciate the new experience!

Lay out tiles, once per turn! If a red Ra tile is drawn or someone calls Ra, then everyone must bid or pass on the offer of tiles! It might be just one tile or several...but save your sacred 3 bids for when it counts!

Show some love as Ra plays great with 3, 4 and 5 players!  

I enjoy the balance of short and long term scoring, bidding and resource management along with the fact that you bid with your sun tiles which the next bid winner will then have for the next turn.

Add the fact that it can easily play in under an hour and it's one of my favorites.

Reiner must own a cardboard tile emporium because every one of his games has a billion tiles! Ra has 180! I was finally able to play this brilliant auction game at a friend's and I loved it. The mechanics are simple and elegant: set collection, press-your-luck, and once-around-the-table auction. Actions are just as easy to understand: add one more tile to the auction or call for the auction. Collecting different sets of tiles means that there are numerous strategies and multiple paths to victory. The game play is intuitive, fast and there's no downtime between player's turns...everyone's waiting to see the next tile! Ra is a classic game because new players can learn and understand the game fairly quickly (scoring is a little intricate) and experienced players can experiment with different strategies. Maybe the game is halfway between a trick-taking card game and an auction of set collection. The center of the game is the question of what people consider "a good bargain" for a set of tiles. Fast and light, Ra is a fantastic blend of simple yet elegant mechanics, keeping everyone engaged and coming back to play again!

This is a very good game design, an unique way to handle the auctions mechanics. There is a clever set collection mechanics also. Nongamers love it. Fast setup, 60 minutes to play. Skill is rewarded in a 3 player game, but fun will be there anyway for any number of players.

Unfortunately, after some time it becomes a little repetitive to my taste. I can play every once in a while, but I traded my copy for a game I will play more often (China).

This was our go-to evening-ending filler game for many years. Crazy fast game (even though it can take an hour to play with a full 5), great decisions, lots of angst and eye-rolling. Punishing to new players in an experienced group. Can sometimes result in one player having the perfect run of tiles *and* the right sun tokens at the right time. Mostly it's both a great game exercise and a great lesson in the economics of opportunity costs.

RATING: 9
50+ plays. Arguably the greatest 3 player auction game of all time. Placing future bidding power into the auction pile is a masterstroke. Limiting each auction to once around, and restricting each player to 4 (or 3) wins each round is key to making a fast moving game. Oodles of luck in determining the contents of the auction pile provide the fun and drama, as well as the continual challenge in determining what's the right bid given what's in it, how far into the round you are, and other player's collection so far. All in all, eminently replayable.

RATING: 6
I don't like this as much as Ra Dice. The physical bag of tiles and the auctions slow the game down, although a 5p game still only takes 60 minutes. I feel like I had less control over what I got with the auctions than I do with the dice. It might be better with fewer (than 5) players.

Mechanically the scoring is somewhat convoluted, but the gameplay itself is extremely simple. I think the BGG weight of 2.4 is overstated, even allowing for the depth. I'll give it a 1.7 for mechanics and a 2.5 for depth, ending in a 2.1 weight.

Pretty fun.  The way the Ra tiles come up and what tiles are available for auction and what ppl already have make for a very interesting dynamic, each auction is different -- and has a different value to each player.

I've only played once.  The game was fun (I don't often win games and I won this one) but the way that one game played out left me a little cold.  Much of the game felt arbitrary.  One player summoned Ra repeatedly with no apparant purpose in mind, simply because he had no clear idea of what to do.  This guy was not an inexperienced gamer - he was just painted into a corner for reasons we couldn't quite understand.

EDIT: I decided to give this one another try and find that I understand it more clearly and enjoy it immensely.

An auction/bidding classic.  Each turn, the choice is simply draw a tile or call an auction.  But somehow even with such a simple decision to make, the game provides a wealth of depth. You are constantly evaluating what your opponents are going for and what the offer is worth to everyone.  The different viable paths of scoring are well balanced and the sun token system for bidding markers is simply brilliant.  Easily one of Knizia's best.  It's icing on the cake that this game even works with 2 players.  There is probably more support for Tigris and Euphrates, but I think Ra may be Knizia's masterpiece.

A truly rare brand of awesomeness. This game is highly strategic, and while it could be boiled down to a series of probability-based decisions, the variables are too numerous to calculate, so you find yourself "feeling out" the boundary between deciding one way or the other. Thus, the game-play is more intuitive than cerebral.

(FIRE) I do like the bidding mechanism that Knizia uses in his games, but this one always seemed a little too dry for me. While many of his games have a pasted-on-theme feel to them, most are great.

RATING: 8
RA is always exciting. I've won by totally different strategies and also lost by the same strategies.  Because the worth of the pot is always is different for each player, and the worth of the suns decreases as more RA tiles are drawn, and each player has a different set of suns, it never becomes 'simple' to evaluate.  RA is particularly interactive, with no downtime whatsoever, and all players constantly watching to see what tile is drawn, scheming and bluffing to complete their set of tiles.

Also, RA is very well themed!  Go read a history of ancient Egypt, or listen to one: http://www.teach12.com/ttcx/coursedesclong2.aspx?cid=350&pc=History%20-%20Ancient%20and%20Medieval .  It is all there in Knizia's game, in proportion, consistent and elegant, with great art.

RATING: 10
Ra is a very subtle game, that seems simple on the surface, but really has quite a bit of depth.  The bidding system with open bid markers with discrete values really defines the game, you really need to pay attention to what other people need and how they would value tiles, but at the same time, be mindful that you can only win 3 lots yourself, and if you wait too long, you might not even get that many.  While there is certainly a random element, there's a ton of tension in this game, and I love it.

My favourite auction game.

The core of the game are the multiple scoring categories. Each player can specialize on a subset of these, which means that every set of tiles has a different value for each player. You're constantly trying to estimate what other people would pay for the lot versus what you are able to pay. After that, you hav to take the available suns into account too.

Ra has a perfect balance of predictability and randomness. Determining the value of a tile is part calculation, part intuition.

It is a solid game with many paths to victory and high interaction between the players.  It is a difficult gateway game where one can't do everything they want to do.  Can be a lot of fun chanting, "RA," for people still left in.

Ra is the prettiest game I own. I really like how the tiles on the auction track are glyphs telling the history of my Egyptian civilization. Everything is well done. The art is great. The pieces are great. The gameplay is simple enough for a 5 year old yet with enough depth to keep an adult interested. The scoring scheme is complicates in a typical euro fashion, but it all works well. I really like how so few sun tiles keeps the auction mechanism tight.

RATING: 7
Ra can be a bit dry...like doing a math puzzle.  But it's well balanced and good entertainment for analytical types.  

On the one hand, it's almost like an "auction game for dummies," in the sense that you don't have to do the valuation and set a bid amount yourself, but rather you have to look at your discrete available bid tokens and decide whether or not to trade one for the goods being offered.  

On the other hand, Ra balances this simplified bidding structure by complicating the lot offerings, and by adding the threat of the round ending before you've made your bids.  What you're offering is easy to process.  What you're really buying is far more difficult, as there are too many sources of points available for you to score them all.

I traded Modern Art for this, and I am so happy for that decision - the theme is similarly weak, but the game is so much more engaging, that it's not something you constantly stare at. Yes, the scoring can be confusing at first, but one scoring round clarifies everything. The auction theory dilemma in Modern Art is circumvented - you don't have to be an Econ major to excel at this game; you just need to be tactically minded.

Keeps going up from 7 and has finally peaked.  Strategy becomes more apparent with repeated plays.  I don't see so much luck involved in this game as high vs. low-risk decisions and probability.  Thoughtless acts tend to have no reward, and well thought out decisions have a good reward.  Very easy to teach to non-gamers.  Easily my favorite Knizia. I love the tough decisions, the myriad options, the speed, and the ease with which it makes it to the game table.

Ra is a game pf both luck and planning with a Egyptian theme.  The players draw cardboard tiles from a bag and place them on the game board or in front of them.  Some tiles must be discarded after each round and others can be saved up until the end of the game which lasts 3 phases.

The components are as follows: tiles are cardboard while both the sun tokens (read currency) and the special event Ra token are wood.  There is also a canvas bag included that is hardly big enough in my version of the game to hold all the cardboard tiles.


This game and Small World have re-introduced board gaming to my family!  Bravo.

Enjoyable and quick to play - you can easily get several games in during a session.  Quick to learn (although to start with we missed an important rule about removing certain cards at the end of each epoch!) and quick to pick up.  Quite reliant on luck, but there are enough tiles in the bag that a typical distribution is generally likely.  As with most games with an auction phase, the bidding is critical; in this game it's everything.  The bidding tokens (suns) are a great concept and work really well.

I find this game quite compelling.  The components are wonderful--particularly the Sun tiles.  The complaints I hear and read about RA tiles occuring too frequently seem to indicate some people just don't appreciate the delicate danger of calling RA too much (and getting stuck at the end as others get a tile buffet) or calling RA too little (and watching the high-number sun tiles become devastatingly powerful). VERY TASTY decisions to be made here and enough flavor/theme (IMHO) to put it among the great greats.

If you enjoy this game then you'll LOVE Knizia's, "Traumfabrik" - I actually enjoy it slighty more than "Ra".  Sometimes I feel that this game has a lot more luck in it than others believe however.

The first time I played, I was unimpressed.  A conversation with a friend inspired me to give this one a second chance, and I'm glad I did.  Much deeper than auction games usually are.

Update (after a couple of years): This is not a game I play often, but every time I bring it out it impresses me.  It's like a fine wine, elegant with just enough complexity.

This is a great game.  I'm pretty horrible at it (I get wrapped in my own evaluation of a set, and don't do a good job anticipating how much others view it, making me either pull the trigger too early or too late).

RATING: 6.75
I do like Ra, but I just can't understand the strategy here.  If it was the only game I owned and/or was constantly playing it, it'd help, but as for now its nuances are more complicated and hidden than initial overviews show.  I've won a couple of games and I'm not entirely sure how I did it.. I'm keeping it at its rating of 8 for now, as I do wish to play it again and continue to pick away at whatever strategies are there.

Update: Docking a point here.  Yeah.. this game is raved about here on BGG, but the demand to play it is low - as is my desire to promote it.

Quite possibly the best auction game ever made.  One of Knizia's greatest games I think.  

The set collecting can be a little daunting to get your head around at first which does spoil it slightly from being a great gateway game.  That's my only criticism of it though really.

Easily plays in an hour making this a lunchtime favourite at work.

RATING: 10
That's it; I'm giving Ra a 10. It's perfect. A pure auction game with so much depth that it makes you forget you're playing an auction game. I originally rated it an 8, but it gets so much better the more you play it. It's even great fun played against the computer. A perfect 10 it is!

Ra is easy to learn - but hard to master. At first it seems a bit weird and random. Bidding is unusual and abstract; you don't bid money, or points, but these sun tiles. How much are they worth?

You think that that's the key to Ra - as with almost all auction games: figuring out how much to bid on any given lot. The fact that you have to put a value on your suns as well as the tiles up for auction makes it a bit more complex, but something you'll figure out with a few more plays, right? (Already addicted!)

And then, with a few more plays, you realize you can't really put a value on your suns. You can now on the tiles, but now you understand that when figuring out which sun to bid, your position in respect to the other players is as much, if not more, important than the auctioned tiles.

And then it hits you: the most important skill in playing Ra is not correctly estimating the value of the tiles, but manipulating your position. It's not multiplayer solitaire. Everything is useful information. You look around you, and see whose position is strong and whose is weak, and what needs to happen for your position to improve. The ability to invoke Ra is your most powerful - your only weapon. You can use it to completely change the situation on the board. Yes, this a real boardgame.

The player to your right just turned over a flood tile - a tile he'd like to have. He has the 3, 5 and 12 suns. You have the 4. Smiling, you reach for the Ra figure, and you realize just how much you love this game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
One of the most streamlined auction mechanics around, and the Ra tiles counting down the end of round makes this game tense. Although the tile draws have some narrative, the game play isn't evocative of Egyptian theme. As usual there are many avenues to gain points,but here it is a busy metropolis (gods=2pts,most pharoahs=5pts etc) and if in a competitive attitude, determining the how far ahead players are is cumbersome. This is essential to do as you need to assess the values of drawn tiles which you will also need to take into account various tile type distribution of what has gone (if you can remember) and what is left. If you do the maths or don't, ultimately this is a game of psychology between bidders as to the probability/belief of what will be drawn in future, which can result in tile draws being unfair (especially the disaster tiles adds pain, hope & fun). If you can get over this punitive aspect, it will no doubt add more tension next time you play. Me, I would rather play something less mathematical to play and resolve, and with a shorter playing time.

RATING: 8
-

A great auction game with great mechanics and flow, which I enjoy everytime I play it.  However, in my opinion it does not deserve a higher score than 8 because of its chaotic nature.

Neither strategy not tactics allow a player to edge out the equally proficient opponents in a satisfactoy way. The randomness of the tiles drawn (especially the 'Ra' tiles) and the equally random timing of an opponent to call "Ra" (from the point of view of the rest of the players) makes for a fairly random and chaotic game with unpredictable results. This is true whether you have played the game many times or you just learned it.

Of course careful examination of the opponents' holdings and their remaining bidding tiles allow for a certain degree of tactics and strategical planning, but still not sufficiently. In other words, hard analysis and hard planning do not necessarily reward a player proportionally.

Why can't I win at this game? Lots of interesting choices with when to call auctions and when to draw tiles. Sun tiles for bidding is unique as the value of a bid is not obvious. The game does seem to have a high element of luck but further plays may prove that this can be overcome. Monuments seem like a very good way to lock up a game if you can get them. Not sure if they are overpowered.

Not an impressive effort.  This is a card game hiding under a board and tiles.  There is little tension and even less strategy. For a Knizia game this one is poor. (In my group, I am in the minority on this.) I find Modern Art and Medici to be much better games. The game lacks control and bidding becomes a matter of pushing one's luck rather than any particular strategy.

One of the best auction games. Your choice is simple: Draw a tile to add to the auction, or call the auction. Making the choice is agony. Lots of tension with the push-your-luck aspect of outlasting everyone else then hoping for a good run of tiles. Plays fairly quickly. Scoring is daunting at first, so be sure to have player aids for new players.

This is a good auction game, which orignal mechanisms in that not only are you bidding on tiles you need, you are also swapping out the currency marker you use to bid with, for whatever value marker was last used to win a bid. The sets of tiles score in different ways, with some flushing at the end of the phase and some staying with you. It's fun to play once in awhile, but the game doesn't have anything outside it's core mechanism (which it does very well), but I find myself wanting more.

Possibly my favorite game ever.  This never gets old for me.  There is so much subtlety in deciding when to call RA and re-evaluating the auction track with every new tile.  You always need to look at other peoples boards to see what is valuable to them and then make their life hard.  I love holding out for the best deal possible when there is only one RA token left to be drawn...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What I like about it is that you make only one choice each turn: draw a tile or invoke Ra. But that seemingly simple choice requires you to evaluate a whole host of factors - which tiles are already laid out in the middle, which tiles you and your opponents have, which Suns you and your opponents have, how many points you and your opponents have, how close the round is to ending. And these evaluations shift with every new tile that is drawn. 

It's a game where you have to be constantly thinking about your opponents and presenting them with difficult choices - to spend a Sun that's higher than they'd really like or see a juicy lot go to someone they really don't want to have it. A masterpiece of emergent design - a few simple rules and a scoring mechanism, let the players do the rest.

I really don't much care for this game. I wanted to like it. The theme is good. The components are nice enough. The gameplay however, is what I consider to be lame. This game is ranked highly, and I am happy some people like it, but I am just not one of those people. I don't enjoy the random draws, or the overly complicated scoring. I generally enjoy games with an auction mechanism, but this one just feels flat and dull.

One of the games in the 'Knizia Auction Trilogy'; considering that this appellation is not from Knizia himself, and he has made probably a dozen auction games, I don't care much for this label, as the games have no connection besides some vaguely shared elements.

A key portion of this game is that you draw a tile during your turn, and then decide whether to invoke Ra (start an auction for all tiles on the board); this process slows down the game significantly (probably doubling the length of turns that really are a decision-less random tile drawing, which makes the game feel clunky in a way that has nothing to do with the actual gameplay. You make auctions for tiles in three rounds, scoring some tiles at the end of each round (some of which are kept in your tableau, others discarded, and some saved and only scored at game's end), and in the end whoever has the VP is the victory. 

There are some neat bits and pieces to this game, and it has the usual Knizia vibe, but overall the game feels sorta clunky all over, and I'd much rather get a quick game of Modern Art or even Colossal Arena than play this again. The tiles really could be cards in a deck, or just stacked tiles, and it'd streamline that problematic aspect, I think that issue prevents me from being able to appreciate the game proper more critically.

A good auction game - one that I'm always willing to play.
The limited sun tiles make the game (beside being a good looking component). Do you call an auction to force others to bid before the stack builds up or that you may be able to use on of your poor tiles to snag something. Do you try to force others out so you can draw lots of tiles at the end. 
A lot of good decisions, can see why it is so highly ranked.

One of the best auction game out there. The game is simple yet tactical. You realy need to have an eye on what your opponents are doing. You then have the difficult choice of trying to optimize your game while trying to steel a good hands for your opponents in order to stop one of them to be a runaway leader and try to make the best of what you have been able to get. There is no down time has you are always analysing you hand and the one of other players and bid on auctions. The rules are clear and simple. The material is O.K. One of the best Knizia game. 

Un des meilleurs jeu d'enchères sur le marché. Vous devez vraiment garder un oeil sur vos opposants et vous avez la tâche difficile d'essayer d'optimizer votre main tout en tentant de voler une bonne main à vos opposants afin d'éviter qu'un joueur ne s'échappe avec la victoire; vous devez donc faire le mieu avec ce que vous avez obtenu àa l'enchère. Il n'y a pas de temps d'attente dans ce jeu car vous devez analyser votre main ainsi que celle des autres joueurs et participer aux enchères. Le jeu est simple et tactique en même temps. Les règles sont claires et le matériel est O.K. Un des meilleurs jeu de Knizia.

Ra is fun. Deciding how far to push your luck and keep grabbing tiles, or else start an auction is tricky. Unfortunately I don't love this game precisely because many times the distribution of the tiles is so zany that good play feels a relatively small component of winning. Getting pretty lucky (or having your opponents get unlucky) seems more likely to lead to good outcomes than good play. Still it's relatively quick and it is at least fun to play and try to best your opponents. Will enjoy from time to time, but just not a game I see myself thinking deeply over the strategy which is the main element I find in games I really love.

RATING: 7.5
Ra was one of those games that Knizia published during his "golden" period, the era that cemented him as game designer [i]par excellence[/i].  And it's pretty darned good.

It's a push-your-luck auction game.  Players draw tiles from a bag which then go into a pool.  If a player draws a Ra tile it forces an auction, alternatively a player can choose to start an auction rather than draw a tile.

When Ra comes around, the tiles in the pool are auctioned off.  Each player can only win a maximum of three bids per round.  They bid by offering a Sun token which will have a unique number on it (Sun tokens are numbered 1 through 16 and the way these tokens cycle between players is particularly ingenious).  The tiles that you win at auction combine in various ways to provide points.  Some tiles are actually bad.  You will also lose points if you don't have certain tiles at the end of a round.  The complexities of trying to figure out how valuable a set of tiles is to yourself and your opponents are various and subtle so I'm not going to go into them.  But they make for a very enjoyable game.

But wait, there's more!  This is also a push-your-luck game.  Every time a Ra tile is drawn it is placed on the Ra track.  If the track fills up the round ends immediately, no matter how many Sun tokens you still have available for bidding.  It's not uncommon for a single player to be left in a round, drawing tiles from the bag, hoping for an uncontested windfall, with the other players hoping he draws a freakin' Ra tile already.

I find there to be many similarities between Ra and [GameId=46].  So many, in fact, that Medici feels like a subset of Ra, a boring tedious subset that doesn't even play in a shorter amount of time.  

Luck can be a factor in Ra.  I've seen games where, in absolute denial of the law of probabilities, a player pulled out a string of awesome tiles after the other players had bid their last.  Your mileage may vary, but I like push-you-luck games and this element of Ra is just another wonderful piece of an overall great game.

(By the way, what's with the home made player mats?  All the info is already on the board and is easy for all to see.  Why make an elegant game fiddly and take up too much table space?)

It's fascinating how much is going on (looking at what other people are collecting, monitoring their available suns, the auction track and Ra track, etc) while on the surface you're just pulling a tile and placing on the track. If you don't play alertly/strategically, you could almost miss the majority of the game lying below the surface.

After many plays through the years, with different groups (gamer and non-gamer), Ra never fails to impress with design, simplicity, and depth of choices.

RATING: 7
Awesome game.  Love the bidding mechanic, and the increasing tension as the end of the round approaches.  Scoring gets a little complex, but it plays nice and quickly.  Theme is better integrated than most Knizia games, and the artwork is nicely done.

While I think that Ra is a good game, it just doesn't make me want to play it. I would rather play Taj Mahal instead.

* * * * *

Played for my first time: its a good game. I like the way the bidding works, and that the distribution of the gold rotates, but is always in the game. 

I just need to work on my bidding choices, as they always seem to hold me back at the end, no matter the game.

Played my second game tonight. I really didn't have a strategy and came in dead last. DEAD last. Did I mention I was dead last?

RATING: 7.1
I like the variety of ways to score points, and the multiple options to consider when deciding what to try for and what to bid on it.  It gives a feel of Lucca Citta for the huge number of different things you have to think about in making your decisions, therefore making the decisions so tough.  Do you take what works for you now, or wait for something better, or stop another player from getting something that really helps?  And don't forget this, that, and the other thing you have to take care of before the epoch is over!  Will there be enough time to get what you need? The auction method is a very interesting technique.  I love the way a player with bad numbers can still take home better tiles than other players through intelligent manipulation of the auction.  (Don't expect me to tell you my strategy, but I won my last game 45 to 33 to x to y to 21. Subtracting the starting 10 points, that was 35 to 11.)  Very good game, in my opinion.

 Always have a good time with this one, lots of table talk, love it! Need a bigger bag for the tiles. Played with 3p and 4p,works well at both counts, feels very different with 4p and only having three suns.

Trade condition very good. Has laminated colour english player mats.

RATING: 6
A bit of a "brain drain" game for me. Everytime 'Ra' is called, I have to start calculating whether deal is worth it for me in mathematical, numerical terms; those who know me know how much I [i]hate[/i] math. The theme is tacked on too. I prefer playing Samurai for the same kind of mental challenge.

RATING: 9
fun action game, with a very clever auction mechanism. the diversity of reiner's auction games never ceases to amaze me. yeah, the game can be kinda random, and i don't know about those disaster tiles, but the game plays quickly and tends to generate lots of laughs. besides, i do think the game rewards clever play.

Update: I think this game is near perfect with 3 players.  With more than 3 it can suffer from weird or lucky draws, especially at 5, but it's not too bad, because the game plays really quickly anyway.  It's still a great game even with more than 3 players, but with 3, it's one of my favorite auction games.  A modern classic that still holds up after all these years.

Reiner’s finest and the best bidding game yet. I treat it as a strategy game, even though the tiles sometimes require some quick thinking tactical decisions. The tension is always high and the theme works surprisingly well. Alea could have managed a bag for the bucket load of tiles though.

While I can be convinced that this game is good with the right group of people, however, with a random group I wouldn't touch it with a ten foot pole.   This game is broken and if someone decides to play what I'll call the anti-thematic strategy then you either have to play it as well or lose.    And if even one player doesn't play against it, well that skews the game from how it was intended.    I'd rather play Monopoly.

After reading the instructions to this game I figured that I would end up selling it.  After one play, I knew it was going to be one of my favorites right up there with Puerto Rico and Tigris and Euphrates.  It's about a medium weight game with a lot more strategy than I thought it would have.  Lots and lots of tension towards the ends of the epochs.  Great components as with all of the Alea games.  Plays easily in under a hour.  My favorite game.

The fact that what you purchase in one round affects your buying potential in future ones has interesting ramifications.

I don't like the bidding mechanics in many auction games, but Ra nails it.  You always know what your bidding "strength" is relative to other players and this is just one key to Ra's winning formula.  Probably the best three-player game you can bring to the table and finish in under 45 mins.

Rating for this one is difficult: on one hand, it is not really my type of game, and I do not really like the looks; however, when playing it, you realize the depths of the game, and what first looks pretty simple gets quite challenging.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I really enjoy how auctions work in this game.  The combination of unique sun tokens with bidding on both the lot and the sun token result in a very elegant auction mechanic that has a different feel from all the other auction games I've played. 

The whole concept of knowing which players can beat your best token, or how your second best token makes certain players have to use their best token, and how all of that plays in to when you call Ra and when you keep growing the pot is great, and also provides for fast moving game play, which I also enjoy.

I also like that it's relatively easy to get a handle of all the information in the game.  In so many games it is beneficial to memorize card distributions, but this game makes it all simple, putting the numbers of tiles on the board and allowing you to glance at what people have to realize there is only one more of that last monument type left.  It's great to be able to do analysis on this level on your first or second play of the game!

And finally there is that small amount of "press your luck" built in to each game when all the players are out of tokens but one, and they decide how far to draw while tempting the fates of a final Ra tile.  Sometimes it's great to be that last person and worth holding back, other times it's a total let down, and still other times you get that last ra token and start cursing your own greediness!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A simple yet addictive auction game. I really like the way players not only bid on the tiles they want, but also the bidding tokens they want in the next round. You can definitely tell this is a Knizia game since players who are a little more math-oriented will tend to find the right strategy. I find there's just the right balance between all the different scoring methods.

Ra is an adequate bidding game that is too easily busted when a good player sits next to a bad or new player. Even at a table of equals, the random elements and not entirely balanced (unfair?) tile effects I have a hard time feeling like anyone really has much true control here.

I like to play Ra, especially with three.  I have to admit, though, I don't understand why it brought such high prices when it was OOP. 

Once you have a feel for the rewards for the tiles, you're appreciation and ability to value sets, and in turn, your ability to play the game well, skyrockets.

I also recently bummed this rating up to an 8 - after playing it in a casual setting (two couples) and seeing how well it went over, I can see this becoming a more regular game.  The fact that I'm looking forward to that means the rating gets a bump.  Fun and quick, try this out.

It plays in about an hour, even with five players. The game forces you, every turn, to make difficult and important descisions, and you play mind games with the other players every bit as much as you play the actual tiles coming out of the bag. Top stuff and my long-term favorite game.

RATING: N/A
Played once (tonight). I really enjoyed it. It might be worth a 6 or 7.

It's a pure and tight  - yet very random - set collection and auction game with some nice nuances to make it thinky and help you feel like you're building a nice points engine.

My concern is that there are a lot of adding-up chores you can do in the game (if you can be bothered) to increase your chances of winning. All the information about available tiles is revealed as the game progresses. This means it becomes increasingly important to remain aware (by adding-up a lot of things) of whether tiles you and other players need are still available.  It does take a lot of the fun out of the 'push your luck' element of the game, as any serious player might say "can you wait for five minutes while I tally-up what's must still be available for us in the tile bag and cross-reference it with what each of us still needs".

Despite that reservation, it flowed well and was fun.

What a great game!  I love this game because it is so simply, yet so complex.  Either draw a new tile, or bid for the existing tiles.  A simple decision altered by a million considerations.  What tiles help me the most?  Do i want to keep the tiles from someone else?  Should I use my low tiles to put pressure on those with high tiles?  This gets my highest rating based on the heavy decision making that occurs during the game.  It's also a game I don't think I would ever be able to turn down if offered to play.

I am not such a big fan of set-collection games and the scoring in Ra is pure set collection. But the central auction mechanism is really elegant and leads to a lot of hard decisions. I like that there is also a push-your-luck aspect, because near the end of a round you do not if you should go for more tiles or avoid the last red one by bidding on a smaller set of tiles. Of Knizia's bidding games that I know (besides Ra also Amun Re, Strozzi, Modern Art/Masters Gallery) I like Ra the most.

Although the game is almost abstract, the little of what is left of the Egyptian theme helps to remember some of the rules (for example that pharaos and buildings do not vanish after the round).

Low numbered tiles can be as valuable as high ones, call Ra often with them. Large scoring of the monuments in round 3 will always trump other strategies. Don't hesitate to call Ra just to trade up tokens in round 3.  When bidding for tokens that are retained from round to round, remember that these are 3x as valuable in round 1 vs round 3, because they are scored all three times.

No surprises here, Knizia has done this sort of thing elsewhere. Players bid in successive rounds for different tiles: monuments, pharoahs, civilizations, etc. These score points (or lose) them in various combinations. Players need to optimise their score, highest wins at the end.
The mechanisms are quite clever, the game relatively short, and the theme fairly engaging.

(10/25/07) - I've heard great things about this game, looking forward to playing it!

(12/19/07) - [3] - Completely disappointed. A dry game with a pasted-on theme. The ancient Egyptian setting is bizarre, and just about anything could be used to substitute for it. The game itself is a boring circle of picking up tiles and yelling out "RA". Extremely let down by this one. Specifically deducted 2 points because of the pasted-on theme.

(07/14/08) - [6.5] - I admit I was wrong about Ra. An in-person game instead of on the electronic version showed me that there is a lot more to this than I originally thought. I still will deduct 1 point for pasted-on theme.

Pulling tiles out of the RA bag is like pulling sweets out of a halloween bag--you hate some and love others, but they are all shiny, pretty, fun to look at.  The tiles are grown-up candy--iconic artifacts of culture, disaster, religion, weathered monuments, impending midnight, each with its unique flavor.  RA involves a lot of pulling tiles, and this helps brighten what would otherwise be an extremely dry game.  It took me a couple plays to get into RA.  Though the rules are simple, the scoring system will take a bit of time to remember.  After I got past that hump (2 games or so), it became a brisk, simple game of hoping for the right tiles, taking risks, trying to guess other players' actions, doing a little ez calculation of numbers.  For a 30-45 min game, it is just about the perfect mix of mental exertion, luck, and sweatiness.  

A lightish game good for gamers, but I question how good it is with non-gamers--there's a 1-2 game learning curve because the rules are a little complex, and because you need to get a feel for the mix of tiles in the bag.  So it hits kind of a strange niche.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I feel this is better than Modern Art, despite the latter being more opaque. Perhaps it is because the fixed price value tiles in Ra truly give you avenues of outplaying your opponent, whereas the freedom of Modern Art feels more of an arbitrary bidding experience. Both are works of elegance, but Ra is slightly more fun.

UPDATE: Years have gone by since I wrote the above and my affection for this game has only grown. It's probably the Euro I've played the most. The absolute subtlety of the decisions - of sizing the lot, of drawing out other people's coins, of forcing people to pay just a little more than they would have hoped, of making a lot just a little too small for somebody to be willing to play... god, it's like sex. The emotional fluidity required to play this well... I've learned about my emotional flaws from this game.

Another of the best-of-the-best gamer's games.  The fact that the piece used to win a bid becomes a part of the next bid is extremely clever, and the one-round bidding prevents the trouble of aggressive play, allowing the player who is last in bidding to avoid dealing with a bad choice for their play.  Everything about this game, even the random tile choices, is enjoyable.

I do like Ra, but I feel a total lack of control when I'm playing it. What to do, what to do?

I played this very early on in my board gaming hobby and was confounded by all these weird Euro mechanics. I had no clue what was going on. Super fun though and now I know what's going on too. Haha. I prefer Priest's of Ra over this one, but this is still a really good game.

RATING: 7
A few playings, won one, not the others, but still don't really know what I did better than others to gain the points...so feels a bit more like luck than skill in the win.  Game I won had 5 players, resources fairly limited so might have won by being the one lucky enough to get a few majorities.  Other games played with fewer players and saw more multiples in Civilations / Monuments.

I like that the auction mechanic is all "open". You know exactly what you're bidding for and against and with what. You also know the same information for your opponents.

Keeping track of tile types and scoring methods is too hard in early plays. As usual, Knizia's complexity comes in scoring, which is too abstract to be intuitive on early plays.

felt so arbitrary choosing when to use auction chips. i'm sure it's supposed to feel more strategic than this, but no. early play is very chaotic because no one really knows what tiles will be released or how valuable these will be in relation to the next set. i can't much speak to the second round, but it was annoying trying to keep in mind which tiles stick around and do what to better inform my decisions. this flopped hard for my group. random + auction + obtuse scoring = chaos. rather play Power Grid any day.

Played for the first time in March 2009.  I was predisposed not to like it (Knizia burnout), but I was pleasantly surprised at its depth.  Lots of strategy variation and adaptation based on the tiles that one has.  Very abstract-Euro for my personal tastes, but a well-designed game and an enjoyable experience.

----------

I'm normally not a huge fan of auction games, but Ra's multiple scoring paths make the game fun for me.  There are several strategies you can take:  investing in the long-term (i.e. monuments and rivers), or trying to get points round-by-round through the disposable tiles.  

There's a lot to consider here, and the game presents some pretty tough decisions.  This would make a great family game over the holidays.

One of the better auction games I have played. It's redundant to post this about a Knizia game, but "the theme is pasted on!" I still enjoy the theme, and the game is better because of it. I like how you can decide between playing it safe or risky. do I bid now and get the sure thing or wait and hope for no Ra tiles?

RATING: 9
A great 3-player game, that's easy to learn and plays fast.
I don't think 4- and 5-player Ra are nearly as great as the 3p-one (3 instead of 4 suns gives less control and more luck, and make it less subtle as the real deal - the 3p-one!), but this game is almost a 3p-only for me anyway.

Egyszerű (akár non-gamernek is ajánlanám), logikus, ezerféle, analízis-paralízis őrület felé kergető.
Knizia mester a 2000-es évek környékén ontotta magából az ilyen jellemzőjű, nívós játékokat. Nem jellemzőek a lefutott partik (ha valakit frusztrálnak a játékok, amibe nem lehet hibázni, hát íme a megoldás).
Néha kicsit Can't Stop utóérzet itatja át. Annak ellenére, hogy licitálós ajánlanám azoknak is, akik nem rajonganak az aukciókért. Tisztán átlátható, hogy kinek mik a lehetőségei, szépen, precízen felépített játék a Ra, abszolút hozzáillő, egyszerű grafikával.
Ha valamit meg kellene változtatni a játékkal kapcsolatban, akkor az biztos, hogy nálam a neve lenne! Borzasztó, hogy mennyire "nem kereshető". Maga a társas megelőzte a korát, ma is megállja a helyét, de a Google érában a kétbetűs név rögtön "lebuktatja".

RATING: 7.5
Another satisfying Knizia game.  I didn't quite get the theme entirely, but whatever.  It's enjoyable, reasonably quick, and pretty.  Largely (though not entirely) luck driven.  Like most tile drawing games, I'm not driven to play so much because the gameplay is largely a factor of what comes out of the bag--though admittedly a larger part may be in the timing and execution of players' moves in response to those tiles.  It also seems to me that, aside from the luck thing (which can be a drag sometimes), seating position can matter a lot, and help you or hurt you--particularly as it relates to who has what tiles, who is looking for what, what you are looking for, etc.  I guess that's the breaks, though.  It's still fun to play--though I don't think I would keep it in heavy rotation.

A good, well-constructed game with nice mechanics and the feeling that this game is 'well engineered'.

Ra est vraiment une petite perle, qui démontre, si besoin en était, qu'on peut faire un jeu quasi parfait en associant un thème à deux mécanismes et demi, tellement épurés que l'Égypte Ancienne ne transpire plus qu'à peine.

Court mais intense, chaque choix est cornélien, et les stratégies gagnantes excessivement difficiles à cerner. Inusable, on le croit d'abord parfait entre deux jeux plus "lourds", et on finit par y passer une soirée.

Tremendous auction game, with some press-your-luck elements woven in. I learned it through its iOS app, but I didn't appreciate its depth until playing the physical game. Understanding what you need vs. what your opponents need and what value tiles you both have to bid with leads to some really meaningful and thoughtful decision points. So far, my favorite Knizia game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like many Knizia games, this features an abstract scoring system designed to create gameplay out of the scoring. I find this often leads to a sense of artificialness in his games. However, the mix of push your luck with open bidding is an intriguing system. And, I like an auction game where you are not bidding victory points: it removes nickel and dimeing from the game.

Classic Knizia lot bidding game with hard decisions and a very nice and complex scoring system. The game drags a little in how the lots are generated (one tile at a time, then pass the bag), but the scoring is fantastic.

I've never been a fan of auction games, so I may be a bit biased, but I didn't much enjoy RA. While the theme fascinates me and the components are all very high quality, scoring is incredibly confusing (to me, anyway).  Thankfully the person who owned the game had printed out some nice "placemats" which had a place to put each of the tiles, and the scording sytem sort of explained on it.  Without the placemats, the game would be way more confusing, I think, than it has any right to be.  With such a complicated scoring system, it makes it very difficult to have a decent idea of how much a partiular lot is really worth when you go bid.  Not to mention the fact that if you happen to with 4 early auction rounds, you essentially sit around doing nothing for 20 minutes or so until the other players finish.  I might play this one again, but I'd rather not.

That's what the "invoking Ra" mechanism is for, and should prevent anyone from benefitting too much from luck.  Very re-playable, and entertainingly tense.

Rented from Boardgameexchange. We really liked this one. The auction mechanic and how you collected and scored pieces was a lot of fun and we definitely will be looking forward to picking this one up in the not to distant future.
Highly Recommended.

An interesting "open" auction game. You know what everyone can bid on a given auction and maybe even what they may want, but that doesn't mean the auction will go the way you want.  Only time will tell if this ranks better than Medici as my favorite auction game.

I'd heard that Ra was THE auction game.  Me?  I'm not all that fussed by auction games.  I don't NOT like them - in fact I can quite enjoy them.  It's just that they don't seem to really grab me and shake me all about.  

At first having the rules explained to me I was a little "hmmmmm".  But that all changed when after about half a round it all fell into place and I just love it.  Now in a humble opinion of my very own - this is THE auction game.

This game just works.  The auctioning is quick, beautiful and so very simple.  It's unlike other auction games which can suffer from players trying desperately to analyse and calculate what should be bid for a given set of tiles - and spend painful amounts of time figuring out EXACTLY what should be bid - Ra doesn't suffer from this as the bidding tokens do not have an exact calculable value.  My "10" token beats your "5" token.  It's not twice as good, it's not worth twice as much and I can't demand to get twice as many tiles off the track for it.  It just beats it and that's all.  You can successfully play intuitively (which I adore) and it flows so very smoothly.

I find it so elegant and I adore it.

On another note:  Uberplay have done a great job with the reprint.  Quality components and a box that is just the right space for said components without filling up with air.  Very nice.

My wife is a big fan too, which helps.

Despite the fact that I HATE auctions (I suck at them), this game is oddly appealing to me. I think I like the unique bidding or something. In any case, I very much like the game. I'm glad it got reprinted with the same art!

Not a big fan of auction games, since they require repeated plays to get a feel for valuations, but Ra is simple and straightforward enough that this problem doesn't come up. Great for 3 players. Wouldn't call this a gateway game though, because the scoring system can put people off, but it's definitely a good introductory auction game. Problem is it feels dry. Completely abstract.

--------------

Not accurate to call Ra an auction game. Instead, it's a push-your-luck game. Keep putting more items into the auction lot, or call the auction now and try to be the only one who's willing to pay? Do you dare to call the auction now on something you don't particularly like, on the chance that your opponent just can't resist it? Get what you want early and sit out, or try to play the whims of Ra till the end and risk having unspent money?

Triumphant design. If only the theme were better. Even Razzia had a better theme.

Same mechanics as Priests of Ra, but a few differences scoring-wise.  I like it a lot, but not sure yet if I like it more than Priests.  The monuments seem like they can make a huge difference and a much bigger impact than the pyramids in Priests.

So after 20 plays, this game goes up to a 9, mainly because it is great at 3-5 players in the same way.  The mechanics are so smooth and I've grown to like it more than the Priests version of the game, to the point that I'm not sure that I need to keep Priests any longer.

Limited resources to the nth degree.  With only 3 or 4 bids per epoch, you really must struggle over every bid.  And especially when you bid becuase you must rather than want to (to force an opponents higher bid).  Knowledge of appropriate values is important and first 3 plays per player i think get you there.  Once you have established values, excellent challenge.  Moved to a 10, this has stayed as one of my favorite games.

I was finally introduced to this game this past spring (3/04) and boy am I surprised.  I never really thought this game would be any fun -- but it was.  I have come to discover that I really enjoy auction games.  One of the things I love about Knizia games is that there is so much going on.  That is especially true in this game.  Everyone (presumably) has the same short-term goals but likely differing long-term goais.  Add in some differing levels of tolerance for risk and you have an excellent psychological bidding game.  I wish I had been able to play more.

My copy arrived today -- Yippee!  Now if only I can get the STEP behind me :(

Ra -- While this could have been just another bidding game, it it instead feels archetypal for its class: bidding for sets which differ not only in value but in function.

In Puerto Rico, the rules lack the elegance I require to place it in my top tier. In Ra, the rules [i]in general[/i] are elegant, but each time I play, I find myself having to re-learn the requirements for each of the sets. I see this as a lack of elegance in that regard. Yes, frequent play would alleviate this issue, but I find that for some non-abstract games, I never require a refresher, no matter how infrequently I play. It is only this minor inelegance that keeps Ra from my top tier.

Player mats available on BoardGameGeek.com have made the rules-refresher much faster and easier.

RATING: 3
Initial rating = 4

I actually didn't find the game as themeless as it's often claimed, theme has no connection to gameplay though. I can pinpoint my main problem with this game that it shares with many euros: arbitrary spread sheet scoring system. Throw on your martix some some linear and some square equations and make it so that you score some things during the game, but some things in the end. Whaa?

----------------------------------------------
Improved rating = 7

Not sure, maybe after half year of boring noninteractive euros has gotten to me and somehow I now think this is good. Current hypothesis after borrowing the game, soloing it and a play with 3 players is that I was taught the game wrongly and had wrong expectations. 

[i]This is not primarily an auction game, no matter what people say. This is primarily a tableau building game similar to 7 wonders[/i] (set collecting, VPs based on some arbitary matrix, theme of ancient civilisation and 3 ages each (hmmmmm....)) with auctions instead of drafting. 

What this means in comparison to 7 wonders is: Ra has simpler synergy between pieces (set collecting) but is far far more interactive, hence I'll rate both games the same for now. They both lack in connecting gameplay to theme though. Bizarrely, thinking of it Fairy Tale is much more "Ra with drafting" than 7 wonders, but designers messed up the theme - what dragons and whatnot, you must build ancient stuff!

Actually Ra desperately needs a big graphic overhaul (like Pegasus did with Modern Art) - if this could look a bit more like 7 wonders or at least Stone Age (and it could), the game would get much more popularity. 

----------------------------------------------
rating drips to 5.5 together with priest of ra. Falls 0.5 more. Sorry Ra, until you get the graphic redesign I like Priests of Ra better (looks nicer, has 2 sided tiles). Yeah yeah, Ra has marginally better tension and narrative, BUT 15 years old graphics! 

There's just nothing really gripping about this pair of games.

RATING: 9
(iOS version) It is "mathy" so there is the tendency to begin to compute sums in your head but that doesn't mean there are not dozens of great decisions to be made during the game.
The game offers many unique twists to both the bidding and "push your luck" style games. A classic.

RATING: 8
Really neat bidding game with plenty of strategical choices that you have to make throughout the game to score well. I like that it is easy to grasp the value of each tile so that you can make a wise choices when bidding. Trading the bidding tiles away when winning an auction adds another layer to the auction and keeps the game tense.

RATING: 9
To me, Ra is a gem among the middle-weight Knizia pure auction games. A combination of push-your-luck and once-round auctions, its gameplay is distilled into making one of two choices during your turn – either draw a tile or call for an auction. 

What is distinct about Ra is the method of evaluation of a particular set of tiles, which takes into account several subtle elements such as how many Ra tiles have already been drawn and the value of the Sun in the middle. An upside is that there is no need to fine-tune the value of your bid as each player starts out with three fixed bidding values. Players can try calculating whether a particular set if worth a certain value, but in the end a gut instinct tends to work just as well. The ability to call for an auction is also unique to Ra, and is dependent on how well players evaluate the current set of tiles and the state of the other players. 

Granted, Ra is not without its flaws – it is terribly unintuitive at first blush, its complex and abstract scoring system can permanently put some players off and outliers in luck can skew the game in one person's favour. Regardless of its drawbacks, Ra is a brilliant design which expertly melds skill and luck in equal parts.

2015: 8. Comments based on several games against the AI in the iOS version.  I investigated Knizia's auction trilogy (at least Ra and Medici) via iOS rather than trying to hunt down old copies of the game. I quite like both, despite the fact that both apps are in need of an update.

With Ra, in particular I really like the sun token system, where other players have a chance to acquire your bid chips.  It keeps things civil, transparent and while still being an auction game and having that "stare down" element.  The brinkmanship involved in trying to get the best tiles before running out of auctions in the round is nice although it's not fun when Ra tiles show up with nothing else in the cue.  It's this element that, to me, makes Ra feel a little more random than Medici.  Theme is completely non-existent, but I hardly care.

Of the two, I *think* I prefer Medici, but I need to play both games against humans to have that "matching of wits" feeling to know for sure.

Fabulous auction game.  Purchasing future bidding power as part of an aution lot and the fact that the individual tiles available have different effective values for each player makes the bidding really interesting.  Using your available bidding tokens effectively without pressing your luck too much is an important balance to strike.  Lots and lots of fun, even if you don't start chanting "Ra" when you're out.

Ra is not a mile deep, but strategies, tactics, and judging your opponents all matter much more than the luck of the draw. It is best played at a fairly good clip, not overanalyzed and agonized. This is among my favorite straightforward auction games. I like the speed of play, tough decisions, the anxious push-your-luck moments, the "Knizia" scoring, the quality components, and the light Egyptian theme.

Knizia's best and one of the finest, most elegant designs in history. Everything works together beautifully and the progress of the game is sublime, with values shifting as time moves on. I love the integration of the bidding tokens into the lots - everything works together! A sheer pleasure to play - one I am always willing to play again. Perfect.

I like the clever way that you have to consider which sun to vote with as it affects your next epoch.  Having bad suns isn't neccessarily a bad thing though, as you can force others to vote on less cards.  The three epochs also help to make it easier to catch up if you have one bad round.

The only irritation with it would be hanging around after you've bowed out of an epoch watching your opponents mount up point after point (though, watching them get scuppered by the Ra makes up for that ;) ).

I've only played this a couple of times so far, and I don't have a good strategy yet.  This may be a good gateway game, but I'm not convinced this is a top 20 game.  There's just too much luck involved since you can draw several Ra tiles in a row and quickly end an epoch.

*****

After several more plays, I have to say this is the worst Knizia game I've played.  There is a huge amount of luck involved in what tiles are drawn and when, particularly the Ra tiles.  Also, other players can play kingmaker rather inadvertently by calling Ra at times when it is not to their benefit but hurts one player and helps another.  Find something else if you're looking for a skill game.

What is truly remarkable about my relationship with this game is that, in every single instance, I have come in last place with the least amount of fame points - and yet I love the game. (Update: no longer true! Yay!) This could be more revealing about me than Ra. Perhaps I just don't care about winning when assessing a game. Or perhaps, at the far end of the spectrum, I am so obsessed with winning that consistent loss presents me with an intriguing challenge. Regardless, Ra is a winner - and not just because he's the god of the sun. Despite rules that are a bit more lengthy and verbose than necessary (I am starting to think that this is a frequent artifact of translation from German), Ra is very easy to learn and teach. Play is fairly intuitive. My recommendation is to explain how scoring works first, as your choices in the game are all predicated upon the value of the tiles.

In Ra, players take turns drawing tiles from a bag, which go onto an auction track. These tiles represent monuments, aspects of civilization, pharaohs, gods, and so on, and are valued in different ways during the three scoring phases. Ra tiles (or a player may simply invoke Ra) go onto the auction/Ra track to create an auction phase, in which each player has the opportunity to make one bid (only!) for all the tiles accumulated upon the auction track. Winner takes all. Players bid with using a limited pool of sun tiles, and a scoring phase is initiated when no players have any sun tiles left to bid with - or the Ra track is filled up with Ra (auction) tiles. At the end of the third scoring phase, the game is over. Fame points received are kept hidden.

The chance element of drawing tiles from the bag, combined with the hidden scoring and the psychology of the short but sweet auctions helps prevent analysis-paralysis. This means that the pace of the game never bogs down and games are quick. It's quite reasonable to get multiple games in during an evening. I also really enjoy the tile collecting aspect of the game, trying to acquire different kinds of sets. Despite my failing to grasp a winning strategy, I have fun playing this game, and so does everyone else I've played it with. Something Ra does very well is keep downtime to a minimum and keep players engaged.

RATING: 1
Well, I'm glad my instincts were right in saying during my first play of Ra, "This reminds me of that auction game, the one with the gangsters..." and somebody said, "Razzia!" and I said, "Yeah! I didn't like that one either."

After looking at players comments of Razzia!, I noticed that the first 5 comments, all high of course since they start in the 10's, all mentioned "Ra" in some way, shape or form and likened Razzia! to Ra. Hmmm...? Which came first? Ra or Razzia!? 'Cuz whoever designed the 2nd game definitely stole most of their ideas from the 1st one. I mean, for crying out loud, they played like EXACTLY THE SAME GAME!

To me the games are boring. Pull tiles(cards), call Ra(Razzia!), bid on tiles(cards), pull cards(tiles), call Razzia!(Ra), bid on cards(tiles). Which game are we playing anyway?

I hate the random epoch ending contrivance of pulling the red tiles. How about this? Keep some red tiles set aside and when somebody calls Ra!, put one of the red tiles on the red tile track. That would at least speed up the process of getting to the end of this boring game.

Nagyon régóta vágytam már a kipróbálásra és szerencsére nem csalódtam. Sőt! Általában nem szeretem a licitálós játékokat (ezt már a Goánál is leírtam), ez a játék pedig erről szól. De egyszerűen annyira jól kigondolt az egész, hogy a játék után csak azt tudtam mondani, hogy ez egy fantasztikus játék. Ezen játék után lassan át kell gondolnom a licitálással kapcsolatos ellenérzéseimet.
Mindenkinek ajánlható lapkamegszerzős egyiptomi környezetbe helyezett csodálatos Knizia játék.

While this is an auction game, I love the mechanic of using tiles to bid for auctions.  This prevents someone from getting into a huge bidding war and being at a large disadvantage, and keeps the number of auctions won consistent over the course of a round (provided you use your tiles!).  The theme of ancient Egypt is enjoyable, and while I have not gotten this out of the box much with my wife thus far, I feel like she will enjoy it in the future.

This game was all about the rate of diminishing return.  When I first tried it I was so enamored with the system that I wanted to immediately go back to it to try to grog out how the whole thing worked.  Over time though I found that the game was made on lucky breaks.  You can try to stem the tide, but often you are going to get what you get.  Yes you can push your luck too far and create more valuable lots for others, and yes knowing when to time your bids is very important, but nothing is as important as getting the big run at the end of the round.

It's a kooky probability puzzle, that just ends up seeming more and more random the more I play it.

That said screaming "Ra! Ra! Ra!" is still fun (which is why this gets a 4).  I'd like this game more if you just screamed "Ra!" at people.

This is a great game, one of my favorite lite games, the auction system is fun and always challenging trying to figure out what other people want, what you need, how far the Ra track is advanced, ect. Easy to learn, difficult to master, has a good amount of luck but superior players will win the majority of the time. Great game

This is an excellent auction game that plays quickly and packs in a lot of fun.  The arbitrary currency, the luck of the draw for the tiles, and the strategy/tactics needed to use the currency you have to control the luck of the draw is absolutely brilliant.  I haven't played many Knizia games, but I think this one is his best =)

RATING: 6
I can't decide whether I love this game or hate it. Typical for Knizia in that it is elegant and simple, but also typical in that a risky strategy is usually the only way to win. Often the player in first place and the player in last played similar games, but the tiles fell out to the favor of one over the other.

What a surprise! It looks very dry like most old euros do but don't let the pasted on theme and dry artwork fool you. Ra is a very cool game that plays fast, is great with 3-4 players and where every decision feels important.

The best thing about Ra is the interaction between players. Most euros rely on blocking, taking other peoples stuff og cutting them off from gaining victory points. basically all interaction is happening on the board. Because it's auction game, the interaction in Ra is much more social. What's happening on the board is just a facilitator for a very rich, dynamic and intense player interaction.

Also, it's more tactical than strategic, which I'm a big fan of when playing euros.

I don't know if I like this or Modern Art better, but Knizia knows how to make an auction game. The players are incredibly constrained on their turns which really makes it all the more tense. After reading a few comments about the game, I can actually see the theme of this one, although not quite as vivid as MA. Those who think it's all luck are really missing the boat on this one.

Ra is a set collection game.  You obtain sets of items that are scored by how many you obtain (such as the gold or Gods tiles), whether you have the most or the least (the Pharaoh tiles), or by whether you have different types or multiples of the same one (Civilization or Monument tiles).  The tiles are obtained in an auction.  On their turn, each player has the option of drawing a tile from the bag and adding it to the auction lot, or declaring an auction on the existing lot (invoking Ra).  The bag is seeded with an abundance of special Sun tiles.  These force an immediate auction, and they also act as the timer for the round (when x Sun tiles are revealed, the round is over).  Players have 4 bidding chits of varying value to bid with each round.  Auctions are once around, ending with the active player.

The trickiest thing is knowing when to invoke Ra.  Often, this is done to get others to bid and use up their bidding chits for that round, leaving you in an advantageous bidding position.

Definitely a good one.  It has a nice auction element, and there are plenty of different kinds of tiles that are possible to get, making it entertaining to plan which ones you need.  My favorite unique feature of this game is that you are penalized if you don't collect certain tiles - I once finished with fewer points than I started the game with!  There is a fair amount of luck in this game, but it makes for variety, and if you play the percentages, you generally will end up OK.

UPDATE: I have to move this up to a 9, because it really is just so much fun.  I love the auctions and the unpredictability of the tiles - you just never know exactly how this one is going to go, yet it's light enough that it's always fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ra is a wonderfully tense asynchronous auction game.  you need to simultaneously pay attention to what other players need and what they might be worth to them, as well as what you yourself might need.  there is some much your luck - you can only win 3 sets of tiles, and perhaps not even that many if you wait too long. 

the scoring takes a little work to learn, but once you have that figured out - it's a great game that's easy to set up and play.  love.

Ra is a clever auction mechanic married to idiosyncratic scoring rules, essentially a VP spreadsheet. Its genius is in its simplicity. You make one choice on your turn, to push your luck or call an auction, and you do it again and again. That simple choice creates agonizing decisions--and it creates opportunities for players to force their opponents to make them. Sure, there's no real theme, and there's not a lot of variation in the gameplay, but when there's as much depth to the interaction as there is here, who cares?

Unlike many games, this one scales. With three players, it's probably the best game I know. Decisions are frequent, important, and the game is exactly as long as it should be. It's also great with four--and worth playing even with five. Tigris & Euphrates may be my favourite Knizia, but Ra is awfully close. Every time I play, I'm never, for even a moment, remotely bored.

Picked it up for cheap in a Tangathon, and I'm glad I did - Ra is an incredible game. Modern Art may have more interesting auctions, but Ra's set-collection mechanic sets it apart.

17 Jan 05. This was one of the first German games we bought, and I really didn't like it very much: I didn't understand (and was terrible at) auctions. I have recently started playing this more on BSW, and think that it really is quite good! Unlike other auction games, money is open - you know exactly what your competition can bid. I also like the push-your-luck element, and the end of each round doesn't come completely out of the blue (as in Union Pacific). So, I'm raising my raiting 6-->8!

The auction values are not real intuitive, and I like that.  The mechanics and scoring system are both unique and quite enjoyable.  A great game from the greatest game designer. Update:  Over a year since my first play and still my favorite game.  I love Modern Art also, but I slightly prefer Ra because the values of the items being auctioned are not as linear.  I also think Ra is the best game ever at blending skill and luck.  Awesome!

This is a fine game, I think the handful of different mechanics are well-implemented and work well together and it has a good amount of depth and strategy.

The one mechanic I really don't care for, however, is the way auctions are handled in this game which is a very large part of the entire game and why overall I don't particularly care for it.

Brilliant auction game. Very scalable, plays well with 3-5 although my preference is for the 3 player game which gives players more control. Excellent play time and couples tough choices with simple mechanics. Love the push-your-luck mechanic, creates tension and excitement. Easy to teach new players but they struggle to be competitive due to difficulty in valuing the myriad of tiles. Scoring can be a handful to grasp on first or second plays.

RATING: 9
A masterpiece. Plays fast, fairly easy to teach, player interaction is there.  While randomness plays an important role it's still bearable as the odds can be roughly estimated by looking at what has been drawn. Experienced players will have an edge because they have a better feeling as far as to know when to call auctions and when to add a tile.

The tension when we're down to one Ra to close an epoch is worth the game price on it's own. Highly recommended.

Ra is a well-designed auction game.  I always enjoy sessions of this game.  Although Goa is my favorite auction game, Ra hits the table when game length is an issue.

This is a great game to use for introducing new board gamers to auction games.  Like other Knizia games, it's simple enough that children who understand ordering and sets can play, and it's nuanced enough that adults of the same skill can challenge one another.

This is the best board game application for the iPhone.

Okay, I KIND of see what all the hype was about.  This is quite a brilliant and unique (at least as far as my gaming experience goes) little game.  It has the pasted-on theme which is so typical of a lot of Euro-style games, but ancient Egypt seems as good a theme any, so why not?  A lot of little elements and mechanics, such as auction, bluffing, "push your luck", and set collecting, are seamlessly blended together to create a tense and competitive gaming experience.  The problem is, the first-time player has rather a lot of things to try and remember, and repeat plays don't seem to increase the fun all that much.

I'm having trouble articulating just what I hate about Ra, but it has something to do with the bizarre Frankenstein's Monster scoring with five points for this, negative two for that and a non-linear function f(x) for the number of partridges in the pear tree -- I had the same reaction to A Fistful of Penguins. I suspect that I am willing to put up with this kind of nonsense only when it is married to an interesting spatial element.

In Ra, the only interesting element is the auction, where players are each fixed to a maximum of 3 bids at predetermined values. The winning bid-tile is exchanged with the winning bid-tile from the last auction, so winning an auction can increase or decrease bidding power in later epochs.

The inelegant scoring has grown on me a little with experience, but it's still game I tolerate more than like. Repeated plays have convinced me that, assuming basic competence, the elements having most impact on the outcome are memory (unless discards are public or the number of each tile remaining is otherwise public; in some respects I prefer the iOS implementation because it does this for you) and whether or not the random tile draws favour your guesses or not. There are degrees of education in those guesses, of course, but guesses they remain.

Which is to say, while I enjoy auction games, Ra is really a [i]betting[/i] game -- you gamble that cashing out now will be worth more or less than cashing out later. You can make better bets than others by understanding the probabilities, and hedge your bets by pursuing a balanced strategy. But the impact of luck is still an irritant.

Ra!

Ra is one of the first games played in my return to gaming (and introduction to eurogaming).  That was 10 years ago.  We are still playing Ra to this day (and will play 10 years from now).

Of course, it took us 5 years to get the rules correct (we kept putting back the Ra tiles into the mix after every round instead of taking them out of the game!).  After playing with right rules, our scores really took off (the game plays ever better with the right rules)!!

RATING: 10
The balance between known and unknown information is near perfect, and the zero-sum bidding creates my favorite auction dynamic.  Some complain of the randomness, but creating strategies based on the probablities of gaining what you want to score highest and still have buying power for the next epoch is extremely satisfying.  
It reminds me of Tournament Style No-Limit Texas Holdem, in that luck CAN win out for the new/bad player, keeping them coming back, but the better player will certainly win more often.  Also, it is never the same game twice, as one's strategy must be shifted by the random tile draw.  Out of all the relatively light/accessible games I have played, this one is the most fun.

This a fun quick paced auction/set collection game that can be played in around 45 minutes.  I have to give Dr. Knizia some props for this one.  My favorite part of the game is invoking Ra.  If you can do it at an inopportune time for your gaming buddies then it tends to really get people riled up and the party going!  2 thumbs up for Ra!

[Uberplay 2005 Edition] {Egypt; auction, set-collection} Ra is a very good and challenging auction game. It is one of my favorite Knizia's auction games (in line with High Society and Traumfabrik). The special scoring rule is the cornerstone of Ra. Its auction system is also unique: the used 'Sun' is bid together in next auction. Ra incorporates both tactical and strategic plays. Tactically, players collect as many tiles as they can in each Epoch. Strategically, players shall determine the ways to collect monuments and Sun toward the end of the game. Although players need only make 2 decisions each turn: draw or call "Ra" (using of "God" is usually trivial, esp. in late game), Ra is quite brain-teasing. 

Players have to carefully optimize their expected gain. This is a bit tricky because the calculation is non-linear: each kind of tile is equally important and is most useful during different stages of the game. Thus, the optimization work is not easy and involves assiduous estimation of risk. 

The Egyptian theme of Ra is very thin. In essence, it's a calculation game using bidding as the core mechanics. Nevertheless, the theme really helps in enhancing the feeling and color of Ra. Though it's a heavy calculation game, it has loads of fun and player interaction.

After a dozen or so games I've now raised my rating to a 10. Elegant gameplay with many tough decisions. This is the perfect auction game.

I really like this game.  The auctions are interesting, there seems to be just the right mix of tiles that there are several paths to victory, yet few enough that there is competition for tiles.  Unfortunetly one of my regular gaming friends hates this game so we don't play as often as we should.

I like the auction games that move relatively quickly.  Ra is one of the best ones of these, with its once-around bidding system and discrete bid increments.

The randomness of the draw makes the game a bit more luck-dependent than Modern Art (for example), but I like that in an auction game.  Otherwise the bidding process can deteriorate into IRR calculations and card-counting, which feels a lot like my job.

Fits the niche of a pretty light strategy game for three or four players (I think it is equally good with both.)  Plays quickly, yet lends to a fair amount of strategic thinking.  Luck of the tile draw (especially Ra draws) is a major factor.  Modern Art is more to my liking, but I predict that this will see more play.  I am growing a bit tired of it.

Fun game, but the title is somewhat of a handicap.  If one is searching for the game from an online dealer, a search for "Ra" brings up every game in their inventory that begins with those two letters.  This can cause considerable lag if one has a slow connection.  I know--such harsh criticism for such a good game seems cruel, but I have to call them as I see them.  :)

Ra is the undisputed king of the simple auction game.  There's really not much to the rules here, yet this luck-pushing game of chicken really makes you question every action you take.  The resources are tight and you almost need to play the other players as opposed to playing the game.  

This is a solid 9.  I can't rate it a 10 because I don't get to play with anyone besides my family.  I need to play this outside my normal group and then I think it could be a 10.

This is an auction set collecting game with a twist.  Each player starts with 3 numbered tiles.  When you bid on an auction, your bid is one of the numbered tiles.

I get angry just thinking about this one. You do all this work to build your stuff up, then dump it into the box at the end of each round. And the auction aspect is terrible.

This Egyptian themed auction style game is one of my favorites.  The bidding mechanic is the soul of this game and although it is very simple, a player who uses it thoughtfully can really affect the course of the game.  This is what is most attractive to me, and on top of that, the production value of the game is outstanding.  Great bits and a nice overall look visually.

The words "I call Ra," will be the most terrifying words you will ever hear.  This is a very fun bidding game where you never know what item is around the corner, and you could strike it rich or lose everything.  This is a game where you push your luck and hope that you hold out better than the next guy.  You hope the other player next to you doesn't draw that last pharoh card, you're hoping you can grab a nile card to water your fields, you're hoping the other guy doesn't use his god card to snatch that one card you need off the table.  Anything goes in this game, there is tense hear break and eyebrows will furrow when intense decisions have to be made.  So will you push your luck, or surrender yoru soul to the almighty RA?

Played only once, it captured me! It's a Knizia's Game (with the capital G). I love his games, not always but almost of'em, and this is one of his best ever. An auction based on 3 round for every player but be careful to not waste your three possibility: the God "RA" is not so long patient. Absolutely recommended to who adores the auctions based game.
Now it's just released "Razzia!", an identical card game but with Mafia background and a lot cheaper, but this one seems to be special (Alea bookcase, components, background theme).

Just a so-so auction game. How many push your luck, auction games can one man make?

There is some depth and strategy but there is also better out there.

Update: It often feels as though the best thing to do is to stay in and get lucky. Doing that will win you the game almost every time. I'm a little less impressed with Ra each time I play it. I'd like to see the bidding mechanism used again elsewhere in something more interesting.

This ranks among the highest of the auction games that we enjoy and for good reason.  Like Amun-Re and a couple of other games the first time through left me unimpressed, however later plays continued to impress me and the game rapidly moved up my rankings.  If there is one thing I have learned it is that a Knizia game needs at least three plays before a judgement can be made.

Just played one round tonight w/roomies.  I thought it would be deeper than it seemed to be.  Maybe it is and we just didn't give it much time to play deep (due to time constraints when playing).  I think as we play more we'll find more depth to it.  Certainly had a very nice FLOW to it.  Didn't really feel bored or that there was too much AP in it, so that's nice.

EDIT: 5 player takes forever.  I don't like too many players with it (too much AP and waiting for your turn), and I also dislike having to pass the little black bag back and forth - I'm thinking a set of bags - one for each player - would be so much easier - or proxy one player to do the drawing and placing.  Something where you don't have to pass the bag between 5 players over a somewhat large table (the table size may be a contributor to this situation).  

I'm not *feeling* it.  With fewer players it's not bad, but it still doesn't *grab* me the way some games do.  It's not horrible w/2 or 3 players, but not great.  5 players, I dislike very much. So that's why it's a low rating for me.

RATING: 9
Along with Settlers, this is the game that really got me into board games.  Strategy is more important than tactics in Ra, but the luck of the tiles forces you to adapt as the game goes along.  I'm a Knizia fan, and this is my favorite of his games.

RATING: 7.5
03 DEC 2010 - I think 2-player is actually fine. You definitely need player mats for this game though. MUST PLAY MORE!
---------------------------------
18-JUL-2009 - Played for first time as a 3-player game. Really love the auction mechanism for this game...there is a lot to evaluate with each auction and even each turn -- deciding whether to call an auction is something to consider each turn. I also found that when you have low bid amounts you still have some power if you use them in the right way.

I think 2-player might be a bit lacking. 3 is good. I suspect 4 will be best and 5 might be a little bit too many, but am looking forward to trying both 4 and 5 out.

I know Knizia's games have usually a pasted-on theme, but this one is too much. Not only he pasted-on a very common and dull theme, but the game is also so much boring and the scoring system(which I sometimes like at Knizia) is a mess.

A fine auction game that places limits on the amounts you can bid. I enjoy the fact that bidding is not just an exercise in valuation, but also in positioning. How much is the current lot worth to you, and to the others? But also, how much is it worth to use your current bidding token and trade it in for the one in the middle of the table? These are interesting questions. That said, the set collection aspect of play is merely ok. I will play again, but I wish the game surrounding the auction was more dynamic.

Ra is a game that I haven't figured out how to play well yet, but at the same time I can tell there is a lot of depth there.  I enjoy all of the interlaced scoring opportunities, especially how the winning bidding chip becomes part of the next lot, and the tough choice between paying too much for a questionable lot weighed against letting another player have it for too little.  Definitely print out and laminate the player aid here on the Geek, it lowers the scoring chaos by an order of magnitude.

RATING: 8
It's tempting to write it off as just an auction game, but there's much more going on. Your quantity of "money" is a surprisingly minor factor. Ra is all about timing and properly judging the state of the game; the needs of your opponents, the probabilities, the value of tiles to you and to others, the impending end of the round... anyway, it's fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
An interesting and unique concept.  I found that it didn't end up mattering which tiles I got and that all of the tiles were basically the same value.  At that point, the decisions became simple and it was just about getting as many tiles as possible.  I'd play it again, but for some reason I don't get excited about playing it.

The bidding system in this is fun, unique and tense. There is real strategy here, knowing when and what to bid. The Ra tiles are a little too numerous and annoying however; I feel the game would benefit from more negative scorers and less random Ra tiles, making for bigger more complicated betting situations with more tension. The set collection is fun and the tension as I sit and wait for that last building tile while holding on to a big betting chip - so much depth here in such a little game.

I really like how the bidding in this game works. You have all the information of what other players can bid right before you. You also have a limited number of bids you can make - and you only get one chance. This makes for very tense decisions and a lot of player interaction. Also I love how a push your luck element is incorporated into the game. And it seems so simple and organic - really elegant. *

Great play balance, with many paths to victory. Quick and compelling. Plays very well with three, four or five players. I once thought Ra was best with five, but now think it shines most with three players, as having four sun/bidding tiles in a three-player game definitely gives players a bit more control and is a bit more forgiving regardless of how quickly a round ends or how long one lasts. Folks who complain Ra is all luck do not understand the extent of control the simple decision of drawing or starting an auction gives each player on each turn. On my all-time best list.

This is the first Reiner game that I ever played. Very interesting game where it is very difficult to value some of the "lots." Of all the auction games I have played, this is the one that is the most difficult for me and I just don't play it very well. I think the game rewards balanced play (try to get good -- not necessarily great -- returns on your suns while getting another good -- not necessarily great, but not bad -- sun tile in return. There is a bit of a learning curve for newbies, but everybody ends up having fun with this one. Ra! Ra! Ra! Played with 3 to 5 players and all were enjoyable.

Update: I have been getting much better at this game and I now have a winning streak of 4 games. I still love this game, even when I lose. The best of the auction games.

RATING: 6
The toughest part of creating an auction game is making the auctions emotionally engaging.  In Ra, Knizia uses labrythrine tile scoring to create tension but that leaves Ra fairly dry.  This is Knizia's mathiest title.  I have no idea how this game is sold without player mats, and I strongly recommend downloading one.

My favorite three-player game. A constant battle to control the play, to steal a bargain, and to keep your opponents from making an easy score. Your bidding chips dictate your strategy, and as your chips change, so does your strategy. A game that keeps you on your toes but that's light on its own.

Really like this one, having played a computer version several times and one tabletop session.  I didn't expect to like it due to the reported level of abstraction but I feel the theme of dynasty building works well, reinforced by some scoring tiles lasting from epoch to another (monuments, pharoahs) and others needing to be renewed each time (civilisation tiles and the waters of the Nile).

Had high hopes for this game but felt flat the first time I played it. Enjoyed it more in subsequent plays but its still not the fun game I was expecting. Still a good game though. Also I'm currently winning around ~75% of games played so I'm starting to think the luck element in this game is not as big as I first thought.

10 plays: Updated my rating from 7 to 8. I definitely like playing this game.
20 plays: There's definitely more skill than luck in this game (even though it really does appear as if the chance element is high - it's not as much as you think). Stays at 8.
30 plays: Excellent game. Its elegance continues to become more apparent the more I play. Rating increased to 9.

Probably my favourite auction game. The scoring mechanics mean that auctions will normally be worth a little more to some players than others. The ticking Ra clock and the push your luck mechanism provides some real tension to decisions and means that players with smaller valued bidding tiles can often do better than those with larger ones as long as the power of calling Ra is used well.

Despite the seeming simplicity of this game it has been a bit of a minor hit with my group and it has gotten requested far more than I ever would have expected.

The play count, ease of explanation and play time are obviously in it's favor but the game itself is an elegantly designed auction and valuation game with a good push your luck element to it.

There is no wasted space in the design and it really is what I would consider a classic euro.  Sometimes it is refreshing to play something like this worth such a crisp and light rule set, such a limited amount of symbology that by turn 2 everyone is fully grasping the game.

There are some player mats on BGG that are absolutely indispensable in my opinion.  They make the game vastly easier to explain, to track and to score.  Print them and use them!

A near-perfect auction game.  Can be a bit intimidating at first with the number of different things that come up for auction, and like all auction games it takes a few plays to really get the hang of it.  But the payoff for learning is huge.  In particular, the mechanic of having the currency for the next round (suns) be part of the auction gives this game that extra dimension that makes it a joy to play every time.  Also one of the few games that I find to be equally good across its entier range of number of players.

Text book Knizia.  The more I play the more I enjoy it.  The fun to time ratio is only beat by other Knizia's.  Bliss.  The trick for me is to get other people to overpay for their tiles.  The varying values of tiles to each player after the first round, makes for interesting and very real decisions.  As with all auction games, weird plays by opponenets can shift this game... but it feels different in this auction, its more changes the ebb and flow instead of kingmaking.  The better the players the better the game.

I love the extreme valuation changes in tiles by the third epoch.  Trying to avoid bidding wars by ensuring other peoples coveted tiles are not included in tiles you covet is fun.  This game has a je ne sais quoi which takes from a game I like to a raucous amazing time.  It strikes the perfect balance between social and strategic.

This is undoubtedly my favorite auction game.  I loved playing this online at BSW, and love playing it in person with my Uberplay reprint even more.  This is one of those games that definitely gets better with repeated plays because you gain a better understanding of the scoring system, and how much different sets of tiles are worth at different points in the game.  The open sun bidding chips are unlike any other auction system I've played before, and really make this game special.

Ra is an auction game with some unusual scoring mechanisms.  It's played over three ages and you have three bidding tiles which you can use in an age.  When you use a tile you exchange it for the one in the current auction but flip the new one over until the following age.  So you can never win more than three auctions in an age.  If you use a high numbered tile (13 is the highest) to guarantee a win of a juicy pot, you may be trading your future away if the new bidding tile you get is a low number.  Similarly you may bid on a weak pot just to trade up your 1 tile.

Ra sun tiles periodically come out, prompting an auction, and eventually triggering the end of an age.  Wait too long to win an auction and the age could end and you get nothing.  If you declare an auction you get last bid, which can be a neat trick to force someone to use up a high bidding tile or let you win the auction cheap.  But if you start an auction and no one bids you have to.

The game is interesting and fun, but luck can play a factor if the right tiles come out at the right time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Ra may very well be the quintessential auction game. Auction in one of its purest form.

You can see this when you consider the two basic actions in the game: draw a new tile or calling Ra (starting an auction). And this is it. Draw and auction.

There is an action allowed by owning a God tile, but this is a special action.

So all the game revolve around those two actions and there is so, so much to think. Which of the suns still remain, which tiles are in the board and which are in the bag, which sun you will get if you win the auction, and so forth.

An amazing auction game, for sure.

My review (in portuguese) is [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/782793/ra-resenha-em-portugues-review-in-portuguese]here[/url].

Edit: After some hundreds games online, I boost the rating by 1.0 - Ra sure earn it!

RATING: 8
Very good game. I might expect that I wouldn't like it as there is a lot of randomness (at least technically) and player interaction is somewhat indirect. But it's an auction game with constrained bidding (which is of great interest) that plays smoothly and in a short time.

There's also a strong push-your-luck element that I hadn't really expected. It's good and not disruptive but I wouldn't say it's the reason for the game being good.

I have high desire to play and replay Ra, which is really unusual for me. To reflect this I'm giving it a high rating.

...What is great about this game is the small number of decisions and options combined with the feeling of great differences resulting from what choices you make. The questions asked of you are sharp. It doesn't waste your time.

was a 10 for a long time for me, but I have to admit that it has flaws and can often result in a frustrating rather than exhilarating game. if all 3 rounds go fast, it gets silly. if 1 player gets too lucky with draws when left alone, it gets silly. (sure, you can try to play to minimize the effects of these things, but the game is geared to have these situations rise up.) I love the scoring, I love the feel of the game, I just realized that I can't consider it a perfect game I'll always want to come back to.

All about timing! Though decisions all the time. One has to consider not only the itens being auctioned, but also the timing (Ra figures out), the sun token the winner will get and the one it will use to get it, how much others are willing to spend... well, a great game.

I try to do my homework before ever adding a game to my collection... While I may have scored a B+ for my research I found that I have to give this game a flying F.  Every time I play, different people, same people... we always feel like this game is so bad we must be playing it wrong some how...  

its random, annoying chance where there is no strategy and there is no rhyme or reason.

Almost a 10. Why? Great auction game. Great psychology. Not many options but many fun and hard decisions to make(start an auction of already drawn tiles or draw a tile). It fails to get a 10 due to the fact that often it feels like you miss the opportunity to make those decisions, somebody else has already started an auction and gets the advantage. ***UPDATE: Having already decreased my rating to a 7 earlier the trend is continuing. Rating = 6.

RATING: 8
Somewhat dry, but enjoyable nonetheless.  The game flies by because of the limited number of actions available to you, but still presents you with a good deal of decision-making. I like my games to have theme, and my first game of Ra a couple years ago was my first exposure to the concept of a pasted-on theme.  After the first epoch, I said to myself "this has nothing to with ancient Egypt? how strange."  Like I said though, the simple auctions and lightning fast gameplay, as well as its ability to scale for a large number of players make this game well worthwhile.  Also, the first game I logged in my quest to start logging plays.

The game works great with 2, and I can't imagine why it's not advertised as such.  There a number of tile distributions floating around here, including one from Knizia's re-implementation of this game, Razzia, which does advertise as 2 players
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the very best auction games around.

With five, the strategy space feels a bit cramped, but I really like how the bag behaves.  Consequently, we usually don't play with 5 and use a minor variant, Exact Tiles, for 3 or 4, removing 6 or 3 Ra tiles, respectively, from the bag before starting play.

Hahaha!!! I finally have Alea's version of RA!!

Since I am a Knizia fan, this comes as no surprise. Just one play and I already know I like it. There is something about the tension and the decision making that makes this game shine. Every single variable is interwoven. A gain here is negated by a corresponding loss in a different area. Excellent!

On subsequent plays, the game retains its uniqueness and complexity. This game is just so hard to grasp and to master. A small change is enough to swing the game one way or another. Hallmark of a great game.

091010 Retains its place on the top of my collection. Just plain delicious. Knizia's games are just all elegant.

The bidding is the best part of Ra. Playing Russian roulette with the Ra tiles can be a little nerve-racking if you get into a staring contest with another player, but it's a very different mechanic than most board games. 

Ra does a good job of rewarding ruthlessness, and at the end of the day, what more do you need?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Another outstanding game from the master, Reiner Knizia.  The ability to call auctions at will, combined with the vital importance of the Ra-tile track, make this a very clever game. As good as Modern Art - and possibly better.

This is a real gem that isn't well known and hasn't won awards, but I really love it. Indeed, Knizia has since come out with two more variations: Priests of Ra and Ra: the Dice Game, but I haven't played either yet. I do really love the original version a lot though. It's Knizia at his finest!

I wasn't entirely sure what to expect with this game, unlike most, I enjoy bidding in games... but a game based around bidding doesn't necessarily excite me.  I watched a few videos and the game seemed really simple with complicated scoring (something I usually loathe).  When you play it though, man this game is just fast paced and entertaining through and through.  Because of the different scoring methods and the Ra tile mechanic, there's tons of room for mind games, forced auctions and push-your-luck.  The way the Sun biding tiles work is brilliant as it cuts out a lot of the stress of min-maxing bids, you only have a small set of values and you have to figure out how best to use them.

Really a ton of fun!

Ra feels very elegant and I enjoy playing it a lot. I like the element of risk in drawing near the end of an epoch.

I've given this more than its share of chances, and I cannot see what all the fuss is about.  I've failed to have fun with it every time I've cracked the box.  Too chaotic and random to make a really satisfying game, and it's very, very, VERY difficult to judge how much an auction is worth when much of it is completely dependent on how the other tiles are going to come up for the rest of the epoch and the game.  I find the scoring mechanisms counterintuitive and uninteresting, but have to admit that they DO make every auction just a little bit different.  Too long for filler, and not enough control for a meaty experience.

Ra is an accessible, fun auction game.  It's a wonderful little auction game.  Reiner's trademark Elegantly Simple Complexity is all over this one.

I like the suttle strategies in this game a lot. This is the first pure auction game I have played/purchased. I am a sucker for Egypt Themes but this game is great to play as well.

Para mi es el mejor juego cuya mecanica central es la de subastas. El momento en el que queda un único jugador sacando fichas mientras el resto de jugadores corean "RA" es espectacular. Juego sencillo pero que es capaz de transmitir emoción en ese poco tiempo

In my opinion, RA is the best game where auction is the central mechanic. It is a simple and short game, but, at the same time, there is emotion on each play. That moment where the last player is taking tiles while the others sing together "RA, RA" is spectacular.

Enjoy the original more than Priests of Ra because of the disaster tiles. Too bad it's not as great a game with 2. I guess it could be but only if both players are equally "skilled" and compete effectively. I usually don't like push your luck games but love the execution here. Also like that new people can pick it up fairly quickly. 

Edit: another problem at 2 is you only play with 6 spaces on the Ra track but the amount of Ra tiles (30) remains the same. So the rounds/the game is shorter and you are forced to call Ra a lot more.

RA is an indispensable auction game. It has a lot to think about with the different types of tiles and scoring conditions, but like Puerto Rico, individual moments of choice boil down to just a couple options (in this case: force an auction or draw a tile, or use a god tile if you have one), so the game stays fast paced and accessible despite there being many things to consider. The press your luck element in this game is ever present and very engaging. One of my go-to games for introducing non-gamers into the hobby.

Knizia; Ra is an auction game with an Ancient Egyptian theme. Each turn players are able to purchase three lots of tiles with their bidding tiles. Once a player has purchased his three lots for the round, the other players continue until they do likewise, which may set up a situation with a single uncontested player bidding on tiles before the end of the round occurs. Tension builds because the round may end before all players have had a chance to win their three lots for the epoch. The tiles give either immediate points, prevent negative points for not having certain types at the end of the round (epoch), or give points after the final round. The game lasts for three epochs. The game offers a short learning curve, and experienced players find it both fast-moving and a quick play. Re-implemented as: Razzia!,  Ra - The Dice Game

RATING: 8
An excellent auction game! The best trick about the mechanics is that we bid for both the tiles (which bring points) and the suns (with which we bid in the next round). auctioning of the scoring subject and the tool - isn't it simple and great!
the look's also brilliant. I really feel like in Egypt when looking at those tiles with neat graphics. the one thing missing is sand in the box ;)

RATING: 7
Single-bid mechanism, like Medici, but with multiple ways to score.  I have an easier time valuating the goods in Ra than I do in Medici, though, so this is the one that I'm likely to play more.  It's a great blend of an auction game and a push-your-luck game, and the tensions come from how these primary mechanisms interact.

Another Knizia auction game; I liked it less than I expected, based on the ratings here on BGG. I'm slightly disappointed in it; I don't know exactly why, but as far as auction game go, Traumfabrik and Modern Art fare better for me. Maybe the rating will increase after repeated plays, maybe not.

Very elegant auction game. While the scoring system is initially opaque it soon becomes clear (after one or two plays), and is incredibly well tuned and balanced. In my opinion in the top three of the Knizia games I've tried for both game quality and fun (which, in combination, just might make it my favourite).

RATING: 8
The only reason i cannot rate this game higher is that the round ending is pretty random. Either you pull out early or continue to play the tiles, depending on your luck you may be rewarded or screwed. 
Still I have fun playing Ra always and casual gamers also tend to like it.

This is a game that I enjoy more and more each time I play it. Most games have a tough time balancing elegance with strategic depth. Ra is one of the best examples I can think of that does this; it's amazing that there can be so many decisions crammed into a game with such simplistic rules.

RATING: 8
A pure auction game, Ra is beautifully presented even though the theme is laughably tacked on. Unless at some point there were four competing pharaohs trying to outbid each other for pyramids that I haven't heard about. I only spent a second thinking about all that though, because once the game was afoot, I was too engrossed to worry about it.

As usual in a Dr. Knizia game, the structure is fairly simple but a brilliant twist turns it into a real brain burner. In this case, players are given a set of three or four tiles with a fairly wide spread of values. When an auction happens, you can only bid the exact value of a tile you hold. When you win, you leave your winning bid tile in the center of the board and it becomes part of the next auction lot. As such, players must constantly evaluate not only the auction lots, but whether or not they are worth swapping one of your high numbered bids for a low one, as a consequence of the deal. To add to the dilemma, the total value of the bid tiles you end the game with are summed and compared, with points handed out to the leader and worse, taken away from the person with the lowest total. You have to be careful not to run yourself out of buying power at the wrong time, or you can end up losing a whole lot of points.

There is also a tense push-your-luck aspect to how the auction lots are set up, which I won't detail here. Just know that it also adds a lot of decision space and drama to the proceedings.

This is a legendary game among longtime Eurogamers and I absolutely see why. It is every bit as good as the best Knizia titles I've played and certainly worth tracking down for anyone that enjoys auction games as a genre.

RATING: 8
I love auction games, and this is a great one. I really enjoy the once-around mechanism, and that you have to bid in whole increments - it gives this a much different feel from most other auction games I've played. Each decision brings a lot of tension, especially with 3 players, as the push-your-luck aspect works very nicely with the bidding mechanism. 3 rounds is a bit long for some gamers, and unlike, say, Galaxy Trucker, there's not really a good way to quit after 1 or 2 rounds, but this is a very minor complaint with an otherwise very fun game.

Excellent push-your-luck bidding game.  Scoring is a bit convoluted, especially to explain,  but isn't too bad once you get going.  Theme is a bit of a paste-up...Rivers and floods are okay (but really,  maybe it should have been arable land and rain),  but why does your civilization keep getting forgotten from round to round?  Why are your rulers duking it out?   What they heck are all these cosmic suns being tossed around???

More plays have shown this to be a very solid bidding game - elegant in the limited bid increments,  and cleverly disguised different scoring mechanics.   Although, of course,  the theme is completely nonsense other than having random art.  The civilization ability of rock volleyballs?!

Ra is a nice take on an auction game with a few quirky mechanics. You only get one chance for a bid which makes your position in the bidding order important. Bidding is done with money tokens and you always collect the last token used for a bid for yourself. I slightly dislike how the money works in this game, but it also provides a few more variables to think about so I'll let it slide. The scoring mechanics felt a bit complicated at first and not very intuitive, a couple of plays are required to get an idea of what is worth what. The game is quite abstract which for me reduces the score somewhat. Plays fast and does not overstay its welcome.

Man, this is a game that doesn’t look like much from the outside and is certainly over priced, but I had a really good time with my first game. I think the whole table came away surprised with how good it was. It’s a pretty simple game: on your turn you can draw a tile, invoke Ra (start an auction), or use a god tile to exchange another for another tile. If you ever draw a Ra tile, Ra is invoked. Auctions are quick because you can only win so many auctions on a turn and you know exactly what everyone can bid, so how much is this set of tiles worth to you? After drawing enough Ra tiles, the epoch ends, most of the tiles are scored, and the ones without a scarab are removed from your tableau. You play three epochs this way, do a final scoring, and count up your points.

I think my wife said it best: she was able to play, keep a handle on it, and do pretty well, even with our son distracting her. There’s lots of room for strategic play and the art is really nicely done.

Highly recommended.

A brilliantly simple and elegant winner-take-all auction game to acquire majority of an  interesting variety of Egyptian set collections and conditions (e.g. Need a flood tile to score delta crops).

Beautiful and thematic artwork for the tiles and the gorgeous embossed game board.

Press your luck at it's finest. I love how the bidding works, I really hate blind bidding games and this game avoids that while not affecting the speed of play.

I have played this game 15 to 20+ times with anywhere from two to five.  Love this game.  Its always tense.  We originally mistook the rules and played with what is now our house variant.  If you bid a tile and are out bid, you lose that tile.  You learn very quickly what people are willing to bid and what each auction is worth.  It makes the game MUCH more cut throat, but that is just how we've always played it!

One of my top 10 games. The different scoring systems are perfectly balanced. The tradeoffs between luck, skill, and playing time are as good as you can get. Most of the time you have two choices: "Call an auction, or pull a tile from the bag?" Despite this simplicity, good play can give you a lot of control over the flow of the game. Fantastic, fantastic game.

Very tense game. Hard decisions to make. If you like auctions then Ra is the best game. One of my favorite games, and my best Knizia game. Still, I think the theme in Razzia works better and that's why it only gets 9 in my book(too bad Razzia doesn't have as nice components and that it doesn't include the catastrophe-tiles).

Very fun, "one-bid-only" auction game with some noticeable similarity to Strozzi (but this came first). Interesting balance between getting the most you can with your sun tokens and trying to get the other players to use up theirs for less. 

Huge points can potentially be gained if you're the last bidder in an epoch, as no-one can outbid you, but you risk being caught out if the Ra tiles end the epoch sooner than you expect.

Upgraded to a 9 after 11 plays; I wasn't all that impressed with it at first, but it's really grown on me. Understanding how you need to carefully manage the sun tokens really makes the game, and the push-your-luck element keeps it from being predictable.

Better than I expected. The scoring is a lot to take in so it took a game before I really knew what was going on. It plays quick and works pretty well as an auction/set collection game.

Sold before I played it. Owned within the group anyway.

Once you've spent your tiles, you don't get anymore actions, so you have to carefully consider what is worth actually bidding on. If you're the last one with money, it transitions to a push-your-luck race against the Ra tiles. The right "package" of tiles can be huge points for you or your opponents, so bid wisely!

Fun: 1
Luck: 9
Strategy: 2

The box cover lied! Ra is inherently a crapshoot if everyone invokes reasonably intelligently. The flavor is perfect and there's something almost elegant about how the game functions entirely off one process (hence the gateway status) but unfortunately there's really no way of circumventing the game's dumbass pull-from-the-bag mechanic, destined to screw people over or give them the nuts at the drop of a hat. Experienced players can decide based on the number of reds pulled, X round SHOULD only last about Y turns longer, but you can't ever say for sure, meaning game-breaking uncertainty abounds. Players can bid with their last token because in all likelihood the epoch will end before a better pot accumulates and then watch as the straggler lucks into multiple pharaohs, civs, etc. Conversely someone can go all out during a round, capitalizing on lucksacky opportunities but picking up low suns in return, expecting to invoke more often in the following round, except when that time comes players pull nothing but reds and plagues and the round ends so quickly the low suns never get the opportunity to win any pot of significance, meaning they get negative points for civs and only get to trade up one of their suns, making what should have been a favorable payoff into a blind shaft. Moreover pretty much every game comes down to the dreaded "last place, first place" scenario where two players are left towards the end of the third epoch. One guy is in a weaker position and requires specific tiles to have a shot at winning while the other person is in a better shape so his needs are more general. Neither player invokes because for the first guy, the pot doesn't have what he needs. If he invokes, the other guy gives it to him and he loses. For the second guy, why invoke when the pot is only getting better and better? In other words, one player is forced to help the other because he can't win otherwise, all to the detriment of the third guy who invoked out. And the worst part? You can't do anything about it. Circumstances inevitably stack up like so and players getting screwed don't have an out. Let's not kid ourselves - basically everybody plays this game at some point; with any luck you'll tire of it sooner than I did.

Pure auction game fun -  I have had a hard time mastering this one if one can truly master something like this. I have won a few but lost many more. Does not come out all that much - I would rather play Amun-Ra - I am not a real auction game fan but it is a very good game for what it is and many consider it 'the best' auction game. It certainly is one of the best and well worth playing. I would always say yes to a game of this. theme pasted on but pasted on well... art work and bit top quality.

7 after 1 play

Bidding mechanic, which includes bidding for the sun token, is innovative and creates many different values for each player to consider. However, there is a substantial push your luck element in the game and this may not appeal to many players, particularly those who prefer heavier games. Player interaction is reasonably high. Artwork is rather plain and game components quality average, but a newer recent version has included improvements to these.

RATING: 8
I know I'm in the minority, but I find the face-to-face game unfulfilling. The icons are cluttered and hard to distinguish from across the table. The scoring system is all over the map. The public knowledge bidding takes some getting used to, as you know going into some auctions that you can't win them. I finally feel like I can evaluate auction lots better after 15 plays. Heavy, heavy luck of the draw. Even when I've won, it never felt like it was because of my decision making -- the game made my decisions for me. Better than Razzia for the nice BGG player aid and the ultra-cool blue Ra turn marker with the gold ink... [UPDATE] Playing on BSW is far more engaging than playing F2F for me -- it's easier to see what other players have, and thus what may be more important for them in auction lots. Also cuts the fiddliness of tile drawing/scoring dramatically. On BSW, I'd rate Ra a solid 7.5... [UPDATE 2] I can't think of another game that fascinates me AND frustrates me as much as Ra. Especially when good decision making gets punishes -- such as holding on to bid tiles to try and get something of value, and having 6 of the next 7 tiles drawn be Ra tiles, so you end up with nothing for an entire Epoch -- that's not strategy, that's not skill, that's pure luck. Bad luck. [UPDATE 3] Finally enough plays (and actually requests) to bump this to an 8. It is a very good game, and I enjoy it with 3 and 4. The more I play, the more it makes sense -- and the more it makes sense, the more I can enjoy it. Still too cumbersome and slow for me with 5 players, tho.

The scoring is a bit convoluted and I wouldn't have enjoyed the game as much without the player mats the owner had printed.  The random lots take some getting used too as well.

I like the bidding mechanism, as well as the multiple ways to score depending on the combination of tiles you've collected, and the penalty incurred from the lack of certain ones.  However, the randomness of the tile drawing does not necessarily reward people for playing well.  There is a press your luck element to Ra in which one has to decide whether to bid now or pass in hopes for better stuff before the current epoch ends.  The game is fun, and I will definitely need to play it more to get a better feel for it, but to the gamer in me my first impression is that Ra may be a tad too shallow.

How can simply bidding on lots be so fun?  Simple, given the nice scoring reference on the gameboard:  Having the most of some things, or multiples of others, or certain combinations of some, or complete sets of still others gains you points, while having none, or the least of certain things, loses you points.  With each bid, you are not only helping to fate your points for the current epoch, but also determining your bid potential for the next epoch, in a cleverly implemented mechanism.  The

We bought this from Tanga for our Christmas present (2006).  It doesn't get as many plays as I would like since it is usually just the wife and I.

I often find myself pulling my hair out during this game when faced with decisions.  It provides a nice tension because of the random tile draw.

Edit:  We actually have played this more now that my wife has gotten the hang of it.  I used to clobber her, now it is the other way around.

Given the fact that I played this for the first time while tired, my initial rating might be a little harsh.

At this point I will reserve further judgment.

Nevertheless, this game epitomizes fun in my opinion, and I can't ever foresee my love for it, or my desire to pull it off the shelf, ever dissipating.  One note:  I have seen numerous individuals have trouble with this game after the first few plays, only to see their appreciation grow after they'd gotten the hang of it (myself included).  If you don't see what all of the hullabaloo is about, I recommend you ask yourself if you've given it more than 3 tries.

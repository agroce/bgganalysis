It's ok, but I don't find this as much fun as Scattegories or Articulate, and certainly not Cranium.  It's a kind of "bog-standard" party game that used to come out at friends' houses, but which has been surpassed several times now.

I really don't care for pictionary, and I don't think I ever have. If I want to play a drawing game, i'll go with telestrations. Then you don't have to deal with people shouting out the same answer 50 times, or one team running away to the end while another is stuck at the begining.

A good game, simple and fun. It helps if you have a good drawer in your team though!

I saw a rival team member trying to draw "Italy" as the clue for her team member. First she drew the geography the wrong way round and then her attempt at drawing a pizza ended up looking like a burst football. Not so good.

Great party game and I enjoy playing this but the whole rule where a team can keep going if they answer correctly is stupid. We house rule that you get one extra go but that's it.

Pictionary. There's something elemental about communicating only through art, having people guess what idea you are trying to portray in your drawings. I have never met anyone that has actually played the board game part of it, but that's not what it's about. This game rates highly not only because it is fun and I enjoy playing it, but because it based on such a strong basic idea.

Hadn't played in years until last week at a friend's 40th birthday celebration--two teams with a large white board.  We all laughed and had an enjoyable time.  The game acted like a nice ice-breaker, helping individuals get to know the variety of people that showed up for the party.  Other than an occasional game with acquaintances, I'd rather spend my game playing time on a host of other offerings.  [Thrift $1.09]

A decent party game which many people avoid playing because they're not "good at drawing."  The reality is that you simply don't have enough time to do anything other than stick figures, so this assertion doesn't work.

The concept of drawing pictures to convey the word to your teammates is a good one.  The problem that I have with this game is the preponderance of "all play" situations.  When they happen, all of the teams try to guess the same item.  People can look at drawings of other teams, or stair-step on other teams' logic.  For example, one team might say "bird," another "eagle," and when the person drawing starts madly tapping on her pad, another team could jump in with "bald eagle" -- even if their own teammate's drawing was rubbish.

There are other party games that I would rather play, and I doubt that I will be picking up a copy to play at home with my family.

This game is just [i]fun[/i] (not to mention a good challenge and a lot of entertainment), and is probably my favorite 'standard party game' (meaning one that is sold in a box in a store; [gameid=30618] and [gameid=22303] (played with books, movies, etc. as well) are as much or more fun with less overhead). I'm a pretty terrible 'artist', and enjoy the game quite a bit when paired with other 'artists' of similar ability. [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1884413#1884413]Different rules[/url] improve the experience greatly, in my opinion. [i][Rating for the variant, not the game's illogical board/dice setup.

I have had fun with this over the years with my parents. I'll never forget one occasion when my Dad had to draw "braille". He proceeded to draw a lot of dots and a stick man with X's for eyes; pretty good clues in my opinion. Well, she guessed blind man and just kept repeating blind until the timer ran out. She finally said, "What the *uck are all these damn dots?" We all laughed so hard we cried. I wouldn't pull this one out as everyone has played it a million times, but I'll keep it for the memories.

If you have the right people this is a gem.
However, it does have problems.

- It is far too easy for one team to get a string of unbeatable clues and win while the other team sits there watching and bored for 30 minutes.

- There are like what, three rules in this game, and no matter how much you explain them, people don't learn them. You have to constantly remind people what the Allplay symbol looks like, that you can't write words/symbols, and that the other team is allowed to guess after the time. People don't remember any of those, and it becomes a chore.
- Moving is based on luck of dice rolls, meaning that a better team can get trounced by luck and not skill.
- The clues are getting a bit dated.

A fun, albeit intense, game. It is especially intense if you have a crazy aunt Marge who gets pissed when she loses and tells the whole table to "go fuck yourselves", and runs screaming out of the house before returning to chuck a brick through the pretty-picture window your mother insisted that you never, ever, so much as press your nose against. In other words, this game led to some deeply-scarring trauma in my life.

This can be alot of fun if everyone is in the mood for it.  There are always some good laughs from people's artistic attempts.  There are usually a couple jaw-dropping moments when someone guesses something almost telepathically, which are just as fun.  We played a similar game long before this came out.  We would agree on a few categories (such as movie title) and each team would come up with the answers that the other team had to draw and guess.  It's just as fun this way, is always up to date, and doesn't take up any space in your game closet.

family game.

Not a bad idea for a party game. I do not recommend playing it with couples though. There will always be one couple who are doing poorly and start getting angry with eachother. What a fun killer. 
Playing with the right group (teams of more than 2 are a very good idea for this) it is actually reasonably fun. the dice rolling and difference in difficulty level of the "question" types are not good aspects of the game but it is only worth playing with people who will not take the result seriously so they won't complain about unlucky rolls or tricky cards.

Unbalanced. If one team keeps guessing right, the other team never has a chance to play.

RATING: 6
Components: I don't usually say this, but this is a game people are better off making for themselves.  The board has that ugly '80s look to it, and the cards could be garnered from another word game. The rules are poorly written, especially around the issue of an All Play and how that affects the timer.

Experience: Artistic skill is a surprisingly sensitive topic with many people, making this not the great party game it wants to be.  Assuming everyone is comfortable drawing, this can be great fun. I'd recommend dumping the board, and restructuring the All Play rounds (they really interrupt game play for a team). Some of the words are very difficult. Alternate, shetland pony, and toad, just to name a few.

2015-08-10 : Over the years we’ve played this several times with various non-gamer groups. Two anecdotes stand out, both of them happened on the same night :

Early nineties and it was a weekend away in a resort with the guys and girls I studied with and Pictionary would be the party-game of the evening. Somebody had brought a roll of wall-paper which is very practical to use with this game – provided you can support it with something. At first glance the bungalows we rented didn’t have anything like that, until somebody remarked we could unhinge one of the inner doors and use that as support. It worked perfectly. The only thing we hadn’t counted on was that permanent markers will soak through wallpaper to the surface below. Not having the correct solvents to remove the smudges we decided to put it back on its hinges and hope the cleaning crew wouldn’t spot it before we got our deposit back. They didn’t.

In that very same game it was my turn to draw something and the word was “jackass”, so I put the marker on the paper and drew a curve – the first halve of a donkey’s ear – and this girl, much later to become my girlfriend and now my wife yells out “jackass”. We were immediately (jokingly) accused of cheating, mind meld and other funny stuff – maybe we were just made for each other, or maybe “jackass” was all she could think off when I was up there.

Suggested slogan for Pictionary: "10,000 thrift stores can't be wrong! Pick up a copy at your local Goodwill today (trust us, it'll be there)"

Seriously, it's okay for a party game, but not my first choice. It has the Great Party Game Problem: if you're not good at drawing, forget it.

So my rating is a bit biased.  Pictionary was introduced to me on New Year's Eve (either 1985, 1986 or 1987 - pardon my memory).  This game made that particular New Year's Eve one of my favorites of all-time.  I LOVED the game.

It still is a great party game.

Not a bad party game. Everyone has a chance to participate but not totally brainless - there's some skill involved. But IMO, totally superceded by Squint.

Pictionary isn't a favorite of mine, but I enjoy it once in a while.  Like any such partnership game, it won't work with people who are going to get bent out of shape if their partner makes a mistake.  This is a game about communication, not about artistic talent.

Ditch the board.

Set a timer for 2:00 to 3:00 min (adjust to taste).

Always All Play.

Person drawing tries to get people to guess as many answers on the card as they can before time runs out.

Drawer and the guesser each get one point for correct answer.

If drawer gets people to guess all five answers on card within the timelimit, they get a bonus point.

Play till everyone has chance to draw 2 or 3 times.

No letters allowed in picture at all (with the exception of X used as a multiply symbol). Numbers and symbols ( ,&,@, etc.) are ok.

I play a lot of a very similar online game:

[b][url=http://www.isketch.net]Isketch.net[/url][/b]

I like it even better because the round isn't over as soon as one person guesses but everyone has 20 seconds after first correct guess to get it.

Guessers get:

10 pts - 1st person to guess it
9 pts - 2nd person
8 pts - 3rd person
7 pts - 4th person
6 pts - 5th person
5 pts - all other guessers

Drawers get:

10 pts - 1 person guess it
11 pts - 2 people
12 pts - 3 people
13 pts - 4 people
14 pts - 5 people
15 pts - 6 or more guessers

I win about 60% of the games I play and play in both US Expert & UK expert a lot

Darn, it's hard to rate party games and board games with the same rating scale. But deep down, I still love a good party game. Sure, it's not ingenious or the best game in the world, but I don't think I've ever played a game of Pictionary that wasn't a hit (just play it with a party crowd, not a gamer crowd). 

You always find something to laugh at, drawings you want to keep. I like that the ability to simplify and think outside the box really pays off in games like these. Lots of opportunities for both teams to draw simultaneously keeps it exciting. 

Great, competitive fun. A must-have party game, in my opinion.

God I hate this game. It's always an All Play, and I can never win those. I never get a chance to just draw and have my team guess without having to beat some other team. One good team can totally dominate, since they can roll and move again every time they get it right. That's a huge design flaw, and I'm glad to say that Cranium totally fixes the problem. Also, every time I play, every single time, there has to be an argument over exactly what a "symbol" is. Ugh.

One of my favorite all time party games. What can I say about pictionary that hasnt already been said a million times already?! All I will say, is that during one particular spirited session, I had to draw the word "New" which I then proceeded to draw a loaf of bread, when my partner didnt guess it, I then drew a baby. After the round, my partner demanded a new partner and my drawing lived on their fridge for years.  I'm not sure if I ever laughed so hard.

Edit: i have lowered the score to this...having fun memories of a game doesnt always have to translate into a good score.

I like drawing, but this game annoys.  A lot of time can be spent waiting for the other team to fail, and then when it is your turn, you will roll and move only to have another 'all play' or something.  Nice idea for a game, and I can see why it was (is?) popular, but there are much better party options out there I would think.

I used to really liked this as a kid when I first got it, however the last time I played it about 5 or 6 years ago at a party, I found it incredibly easy. I don't know if it was because the people I was playing with were exceptionally good? or if it's just more of a kids game.

I got bored quickly with it, and when we were done one game, my friend's girlfriend said "let's play again." I didn't want to be the one to say no, so we did. It was even more tedious the second time. After that, it was put away, and has yet to be reopened.

I hate art, and don't like guessing games very much.  This makes me kind of a killjoy for party games, but pictionary is one that gets more fun with more people (because I do less drawing).

Classic lightweight family/group/party game. As an artist, it's a fun challenge to interpret one-word ideas into drawings; to get people to say a certain thing by drawing other particular things.

Though I love Euros and games as heavy as Agricola, I will never say no to Pictionary.

If you can't convince your inlaws that there is more to gaming than Monopoly and Risk then maybe this is the game for them.  My suggestion to you is to try to find more excuses not to visit.  Maybe I am sore because I can't draw very well.. :)

Can be very entertaining!  Limited reply value with out expansions, if you play with the same group of people you can remember what they have drawn.

Most Entertaining Moment:  When my mom had drawn a casket, female stick figure shedding tears then she kept going over the face with the pencil.  We guessed funeral, casket, dead, etc. but did not get it.  It was "Black Widow".  Every other time somebody would draw a spider with an hourglass on the back.  We were rolling with laughter.

RATING: 5.5
First off, you should Still Have Fun Guessing what other people draw, EVEN IF YOU DON'T DRAW WELL YOURSELF. (Sorry, but I can't stress this enough to the whiners out there.)

Secondly, if you do like this game, I recommend "Win, Lose or Draw"which I find to be slightly better.

Of course this is a party game (a decent one), and if the crowd isn't into party games, don't bother playing.  If they want some quick drawing fun, then play this.

I'm not sure if it is the "deluxe edition" that comes with a large white board instead of sheets of paper, but if possible, I recommend using a chalk board or large white board when playing--I prefer to have both teams be able to see each others drawings on the all plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun party game, but there is a prerequisite:  knowing how to draw.  Since I am incapable of drawing a line so that it resembles a line, I really stink at this game.  I am the object of a great deal of mirth.  But that's more or less the object of the game, isn't it?

A fun game to play occasionally when there are too many people for anything except a team game.  Has led to many laughs with the outrageous drawings that typically result.  We like to see how couples play together as a team. However I have witnessed bad artists being made to feel they are dragging the team down by ultra competitive fellow players so teams of three or more can be a good safeguard.

Este es un juego muy divertido y sencillo de jugar, genial para fiestas o salidas entre 2 parejas.  Es mejor jugarlo con alguien que se conozca bien si quieren ganar.  La edición en español parece estar muy localizada en México, así que ciertas cartas tendrán que ser removidas.
Es un juego de entenderse bien entre las personas, las habilidades artísticas son indiferentes y hay buenas oportunidades para que haya una competencia y que no sea que solo un grupo juegue hasta ganar.

Very popular in our family [pretty big one as I have 4 brothers and 1 sister] about 15 years ago when we played men against women - also known as the Battle of the Sexes. And when things got too furious there was always a kiss and make up later.

Almost my favourite game ever.  I always enjoy playing this one, and the pictures that are drawn are often classics.  A "laugh out loud" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game nobody wants to play because they "can't draw" but frankly that's why you should play. It's good for wacky fun with the right people but with the wrong group it's just drawing a blob and then pointing at it over and over.

I generally do not like party games, and this game is exhibit A in why.  If I wanted to draw I would have been an artist.  Since I cannot draw this is supposed to be fun?

I had to try so hard to convince college friend group to actually play but within 5 minutes won them over.  By the time we graduated we had a 8-foot white board dedicated to our bi-weekly games.

Seeing grandpa (a slow and detailed engineer) verses niece (5 year old wall-bouncer) is priceless.

The extreme number of "All Plays" in the version we have pretty much have everyone drawing all the time.  That's good in that no teams get bored, but annoying in trying to track who's turn it is and who goes next.

This is a bad game when played on paper. We use a large white board in front of the whole group and play it with out the game board. This seems to make it much more fun and interactive.

RATING: 7
I'm a cartoonist. This used to be my favourite game. But I think I started to get on my family and friends' nerves because I was asking to play it all the time. When we have friends over who are willing to play Pictionary, the box is the closest one for me to reach on my shelves. Not something I would play with my usual weekly strategy gaming group, but for some simple casual party game fun, this game ticks all the boxes.

Played once.  Silly.  Played with my brother and it was ridiculous.  We are so similar that we could draw a line or a curve and know what to say.  You'd think it was mind-reading or something.  This is not my style of game, but if someone says this is being played, I guess I would join in.

RATING: 8.5
The best party game in my opinion. Even though other games do the same and even more in terms of game mechanisms (Time's Up), Pictionary's choice of words and the board itself works extremely well. Highly recommended.

1.2.2014 Review: 9 -> 8.5 After hundreds of plays and introducing myself to many new games, I have to realistically rank this game slightly lower even though it still is awesome.

In my opinion, this is the worst game ever created. Let's make a party game that is solely built on a player's ability to draw. Oh wait, what if a player can't draw well? Duh! Let's penalize him, and more importantly, penalize his team. No gestures, words, letters, just pictures. How is this even considered a game?

People will often protest that they don't like Pictionary - either because they claim they're no good at it, or because they think it will lead to marriage break-ups.

Word of advice: never plays this game as "boys against girls." Women have some secret mojo thing going where one of them will draw a circle and a teammate will yell "cow" and she'll be right. They cheat. I don't know how they do it but they do. You've been warned.

As an artist people always expect me to excel at this game. I haven't found that to be true. In fact, a more rudimentary approach to drawing isn't such a bad thing. Overall a decent party game, but one that a lot of folks are reluctant to play because they don't think they are "creative" enough.

Classic party game. Team competition. Up to 4 teams with 2 or more players per team. Probably my favorite party game, and I'm not that keen on them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
I think this is better in a group of friends you know, but I played with people I didn't know, so it soured the experience a bit. Overall, I found it a bit hit or miss depending on some movie titles you know or don't, so it was a bit binary and made me more uninterested. We played with 15+ people so downtime was high with 3 teams and there was heckling, so I couldn't hear, and I didn't think it was fun to heckle. Also they didn't have a point count they would play to, so it went for 2 hours ish or more, which is way too long for such a light party game.

Overall, not as funny or fun as I'd like, though I'd enjoy a shorter session with a group I know. Still, I find it inferior to other games like Telestrations which give a similar experience but more streamlined and funnier/more universal IMO with much less downtime. (Yes, downtime is reduced if you're laughing and having fun, but I just didn't to the same degree. Part of it is that I dislike most drawing games though.)

Classical party game that has some serious issues - apart from the cards that get repeated after lots of plays biasing towards experienced players and the luck of the dice, the game always finishes after a collective challenge. The problem is that it doesn't matter how inept your partners are, if you don't sneak a peek at the other group's drawings you can always try words similar to the ones they're saying.

I really liked [i]Pictionary[/i], although I haven't played it in years.  It is charades for people who'd rather draw than move around.  I have purchased many copies and given them away as gifts before I discovered BGG.  I wouldn't give [i]Pictionary[/i] as a gift now.

I don't much enjoy this as a game, although the interaction it can lead to can be quite fun. There are just so many better games, even for parties. But if you're playing to win, you'd better have a team full of extroverts, because quiet, inhibited people won't be much help. Mainly, it goes on too long, with too many difficult topics, and sometimes the words are incorrect for the category (verbs for objects, etc.). One of my very bottom picks for this kind of casual group party game.

This is just a horrible experience for those with little artistic merit. Trying to get an idea across with stick figures is possible, but the frustration of not being able to execute what's in your mind to get an idea across, for both the drawer and the partner, is the antithesis of fun. Happy if I never play this again.

Good classic drawing/guessing game. Can potentially create an evening of laughs and memories. I've actually tried to preserve some of the best drawings. One of the great charades variants. If people have a tough time drawing, this game can also potentially lead to a disastrous time.

I no longer need to play this now that Telestrations is around.

I enjoy drawing games, but the classic Pictionary does have some problems.  The roll-and-move aspect is both frustrating and completely unnecessary--you'd probably have more fun just keeping a tally of correct guesses.  I don't mind there being some "all-play" cards and others not, as both drawing and watching others draw and try to guess is fun.  However, landing on an "all-play" board space is frustrating--a faster team may mean you may never advance again.  Despite this, this game is decently fun and very well-known, so it does get to the table from time to time.

RATING: 4
A good concept to draw what is described. The broken rules and a lack of common sence while writing them totally destroys this one. Don't know whether there are different variations or what, but for example the option that team can win by guessing all the words before other team even gets to do anything...

Needs a lot of house rules to work. Too bad, since I enjoyed the drawing part even though I'm not good at it. 4->6 probably, with a proper set of rules. I'm not going to invent those rules though.

RATING: 8
An interesting, and for a change very well-paced, game which has been falsely labelled a "party" game, I think, a term which should be reserved for less cmpetitive titles.  The real design beauty of the given clue cards is that they are equally accessible to people with no artistic talent -- indeed, too much eye to artistry often sinks a team.  This game loses one point because it *must* be team-played, occasionally frustrating those with odd numbers of players (like only three) or irregularly shaped tables (which make it hard for players to view the pad).  I've never had, nor seen, a stagnant game of pictionary.

Another one from my mass-market boardgaming days. This is actually the best of that bunch. A decent party game, that offers some good laughs. Though it features the hated roll-and-move mechanic, it matters much less than say, in Trivial Pursuit or Monopoly, as it just determines the subject of the drawing and you don't have to hit a specific spot to end the game.

I think this is THE quintessential party game, the "party" game that came after Trivial Pursuit and stared the whole craze. It is designed unusually well for this type of game.

I'm not a big fan of party games, but this is one of the best!!

Is this really a game?  I mean you could have more fun WITHOUT the board and dice etc.  Admittedly, drawing stick figures to convey words like "mauve" is kinda fun, but the actual "game" is kind of lame. Again, another party game that is safe to play in "proper" company.  Anyone for a game of "Dungeon Dwellers, Crypt of the Sorceror"? 

I'm going to say this one belongs to my wife...I don't like being labeled as "owning" this game!

I like drawing.  I'm good at guessing abstract sketches.  A good party game as long as everyone has reasonable understanding of the words and people being drawn.  Unfortunately, this game seems to appeal to families, but it often degenerates into people being taken aside so someone can describe what it is that they're supposed to be drawing.  This disrupts the flow too much and makes the game tedious.

Probably one of the greatest party game. Pictionary is not about drawing but guessing. Ask van Gogh to play and he could be beaten in no time if teaming a bad guesser, because many of the cards are just undrawable. It brings us great fun every time we play. And the greatest fun comes with the moment when you laugh at a very illegible drawing. 'What on earth are you actually drawing?'

Better than Charades because there's more free association and 'alternative creativity' even if you can't draw. Make the rules clear at the start and enforce them.

Two-way communication, one through speech and one through visuals. It does the same thing as Telestrations/Eat Poop You Cat, except it's a true game with winners instead of an activity, yet EPYC is held in higher esteem. Must be cult of the new.

Essentially this is Alias, where instead of explaining you draw. Even though the game provided some laughs, it was a bit of a pain to play, when everyone was a non English speaker. I assume the game is better for native English speakers. Given a choice though, I would just play (a localized version of) Alias instead.

Update: Originally I planned to sell it, but then decided keep the cards to play as Alias with foreigners, English students and native English speakers.

10 JUL 05: I remember this game fondly (8/10), but it's been sitting on the top shelf for YEARS so it goes down to a 7. Cranium seems to have taken over it's place in party games.

A blast to play with the right people, but the answers can vary in difficulty too much. On one turn you'll have to draw something like "Between a rock and a hard place" and the next turn you'll get "Dinosaur". It could be improved greatly by organizing the answers by order of difficulty and making it so the more difficult ones come later in the game.

It's a fun party game at first, but it almost always dies out before anyone reaches around the board. It's much more fun to just use the cards and try to guess what your friend's are drawing than to play by the rules. That basic idea is always a blast at parties. I'd give that game an 8. The only reason to even use the cards is because it increases the likelihood of said friends not being sure how to draw their target word/phrase/action/thing which leads to the more entertaining sessions. Playing it freestyle with an ambitious group full of poor artists works about as well. :)

As a board game, following the rules in the box, it's not very fun.

My wife&#039;s favorite game, and it should be. She&#039;s practically a mind-reader when playing it! I always play on an opposing team from her so i never win, but I enjoy overcoming my poor drawing skills by developing a symbolic shorthand using previous clues during the course of the game. By the last clue, I can write the Gettysburg Address just using squiggly lines and stick figures!

Culled - First wave; Yard sale

Why we culled it: This is the classic first edition of Pictionary, a design which has honestly seen some big improvements over later editions (such as the challenge dice which require players to draw blindfolded, with their off hand, etc). I remember this game fondly from my childhood. It doesn't really translate well into the modern gamer scene, especially in light of the similar space occupied by games like Telestrations. It was time for a better home, but I still have pleasant memories of this game.

Playing Pictionary may remind you of Charades, but with drawing on paper instead of acting out the answers. In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated "All Play," one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.

RATING: 9
Great party fun, especially if you are artistically challenged like me. "What's that supposed to be" is often heard on my turn. Guessing can become frantic with the mute artist jabbing their pencil at the (obvious to them) drawing.

RATING: 6.5
It's a good, fun party game, that I will usually play if everyone else wants to (and because I'm good at it). Sometimes in an All Play, it can get really annoying when none of the guessers can't get it and you all start trying to spell out each letter. Although, once I got my partner to guess "Ornament" by drawing a horn, a car and a tent after several minutes, which was kind of amusing.

I might look into Luck of the Draw as an alternative, as it doesn't seem to rely on drawing ability.

I only have this game because I was given it, and for that rare occasion when a group of non gamers come round and a team party game is required. It's not awful, but it gets the low mark because it hardly ever gets played.

RATING: 7
One of my favorite party games.  Ability to draw doesn't matter as much as ability to symbolize.  Often surprising how best players are not best artists.  Should be noted that this game can be made easily by hand with every player writing down a few suggestions and all of the suggestions going into a hat, then having the teams draw when it is their turn.

I don't find myself in a position to play too many party games, but if I have to do so then Pictionary is one that I don't mind. It's usually good for a few laughs at everyone's ineptitude at simple communication, but like most party games it's hard to really consider it a game, seeing as most people don't even keep score or bother with moving the pawns around the board.

RATING: 4
Fun overall, but it can be incredibly frustrating.  And the game is marred by the timing of All-Plays and the inane practice of requiring an exact roll to get to the end (IIRC).  Much more fun as an activity than a game.

I still love pictionary. Barrel of laughs every time and you don't need to be good at drawing, the best moments that you'll remember and crawling on the floor laughing at a bad drawing when you realise what they were trying to get

I like this better than just plain charades and it is always fun to see other peoples drawings.  this was like my number one game when I was in high school before I really got into board gaming and it still holds a place on my shelf.  one of the better party games that I like, but definitely not for every crowd.

We played this so much growing that my mother bought a giant white board to draw on, and we'd move the kitchen around to gather around it.  Great memories, and a game that I think will come around again as the nieces and nephews get older.

We got this when it first came out and it's always really fun to play.  Of course, you need at least 3 people and actually should have at least 4 people to make it really go properly. It is alos one of those games that can, however, cause tensions to boil between teammates!

Mass market party games rarely appeal to me, and while this may be a hair more fun than most in my opinion, I still don't like it. I would steer players towards Telestrations instead (although I still contend that Telestrations is a fun activity, and not a game).

The one thing I don't like about this game is how often it requires all-teams play. It just becomes very loud and very annoying. If this feature was kept more in check, the game wouldn't have everyone playing all the time, but it would make the overall game more playable. In any case, I usually only do everybody-plays when landed on on the board, not when the card instructs it.

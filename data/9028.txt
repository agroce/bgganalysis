Not bad, though it is a bit chaotic with a fullish complement.  It's also pretty abstract and I'm not a big fan of abstracts.  Having said that, it's quick, colourful and reasonable fun.  There are other games of the same length I'd sooner play though.

There is something about this game that doesn't work.  It appears very easy, but I can see some problems.  First, a 3 player game doesn't seem to work.  The last player to go always gets screwed so bad.  Next, there can be some downtime as one tries to optimize the emigration and splitting of ships back and forth between beaches.

Game with nice mechanic and theme. Problem is, with few players it's too determined and with more players it's too chaotic, and there seems to be no in-between.. perhaps 3 players. Also, if you get to bad position, it's hard to rise.

i was concerned about a lack of decision-making after first reading the rules.  in play, i found the bounceback effects downright wonky.  i'd really like to get in some games at bsw to see the rules strictly enforced.  we all thought that we had it right, but it still seemed strange.  one thing i did confirm later is that royal island markers don't actually count as boats.  even under perfect conditions, i don't think it's likely that it would ever rise to being a desired game.  i like the box, production, etc and i'm willing to give it more play.

Chain reactions are a lot of fun, drowning less so. Plays better the more you have. Almost always has a seriously abrupt ending.

RATING: 7
Game mixes cooperation and competition.  Random tile draws can lead to vastly different outcomes.  Does not scale well to 2, but plays well with 3-5.  Subsequent playings have revealed that the game play style must change radically with the number of players.  It is not the same game with 2 as it is with 4.  A good game that flys under the radar more than it should.  [GTI Code: TGCD]

Tongiaki is a well-themed abstract exploration game. The real fun-factor in the game is the movement of the boats from island to island. I really enjoy every aspect of the boat migration: setting chain reactions, attacking opponents boats, setting off on a perilous exploratory voyages. It makes the game very enticing, tense, and at times a bit vicious. While I like the migration mechanic it is ultimately not all that "clean". Once in a while, the game will break down due to the random tile draws: either one player gains a substantial advantage or the players become isolated from another, causing the game to devolve into an exploration race to get the largest islands. Fortunately, the game is rather short so I don't mind playing through a few "weird" games (no different than Ra), but others may find the fiddliness annoying.

Rating based on three plays. One by myself to get the rules down and two as a 2 player game with my wife. The game shows potential. The second game was better than the first as new strategies started opening up to me throughout the game that I want to try next time I play. During the third game my wife and I realized that we had to help each other to help ourselves. The end portion of the game is when you give each other the boot. -a cooperative (subtle) backstabbing game....

Interesting little tile laying game. The players have to work semi-cooperatively (or not, but it helps) to get new tiles drawn to score points. My main downside for this game is the fact that 1 player can get completely knocked out early in the game if they make a stupid move or 2. This has happened twice in my 4 games (not to me, though!). Make an offer if this sounds like your knid of game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I find this hard to rate; I like it, but it's very hard to follow any strategy, as the board position can change so drastically from turn to turn. Still quite good fun for four or five players (three have a little more control, but can be hemmed in by the "number-of-colours-in-a-flotilla" rule) but only for one or two games.

Edit (10/10/10): Now that I'm over the novelty of it, I only play it when I can't persuade everybody to play something else. Going first is a significant advantage and at least one player in most games is going to have turns that consist of playing one or perhaps two pieces and then having to watch the next player take a 10-minute turn consisting of migration after migration. Four is probably the least worst number to play with; any more and you may as well do something else between turns, as there's no point in planning until your turn comes about. Demoted from a 7 to a 5.

Loopy little game...I like the domino effect, the speed of play, the groovy game-drive mechanism, and the tiles/bits. It is a bit easy to wind up with clumps of players on different areas of the board, destined never to meet again. Randomness doesn't bother me - never does in games in general.

RATING: 9
This is a great tactical game, that almost has a war-gamey feel to it.  You grow your "armies" of boats, branch out and try and "control" as much territory as you can, and you can directly push you opponents boats off of island and even to death in dead-end ocean paths.  I've mostly played it 2-player with the official variant of using neutral boats on the beginning island and each new island.  I dropped the rating by a .5 because, although I think the luck is for the most part at a welcome level, occasionally you can have a game where the luck takes over, like if the tile drawing is skewed, or the 5 point tiles come out at the end and sway the lead without any time for reaction.

My best Tanga purchase.

Fairly easy to explain, but the strategy seems too simple:  almost always put your opponents' boats on the smallest beaches.  Shove them off into unknown territory (perhaps to be lost at sea), while you stay behind.  OK, there's a little more to it than that, but not enough to keep my interest, unfortunately.

I do like this one.  For an essentially tactical game, the theme actually comes across very well.  Lots of opportunities for rapid changes of control and general screwage.  Good fun.  Quick too; you can usually get two or three games in on an evening. It's best with only three players, though; with more, you can be waiting a while for your next turn and, when it comes back around, you've no pieces left on the board.

High random factor, which isn't inherently bad but can result in players getting knocked out for no reason other than a bad tile draw.  Worse is that it really has only one strategy and it is an obvious one (put your boats on the big beaches, put everyone else's on the small ones and try to migrate them off the island at some point).  It's OK, but not really enough there to hold my interest.

RATING: 7
Rating based upon one play with two players, using four extra ships on Tonga at the beginning and a queue of 15 ships for making landfall. Early on, I there isn't much control in the game, and expeditions tend to get lost at sea if there are several unlucky water tile draws in a row. But as the game progresses and more islands appear, and especially as connected chains of islands form, the game becomes much more tactical, as players intentionally send flotillas to certain death at sea to gain a monopoly on a high-scoring island, which, if there is time, can be secured by making it royal. There's a lot to think about, and Tongiaki is no simple lightweight. At the same time, it's quite accessible, and probably has a sweet spot at about four players.

Tongiaki was a flop; it’s too chaotic and has too much luck. I mean, what’s the deal with flipping tiles and then accidently turn over a water 4 tile – then your boats are just destroyed?! That seemed like a very strange mechanic… You’re also dependent on what the other players do and if they help your ships moving and more importantly where to. This can hinder or improve your game plan even though you had nothing to do with it. I think there might be some tactical aspects of the game, but the luck of the random tiles ruin it for me…

I've only played this as a 2-player game, and I feel there are a couple of snags with 2.  First of all, a lot of the paths are useless, because they require more than 2 players to use.  Also, some islands can become complete roadblocks because one player can completely prevent the other from going further--and again, since there are many null paths with just 2 players, this can be frustrating.  With more than 2 players, I'd *think* that it would be harder for one player to completely block others from going in a certain direction; at worst, the other players could probably collude to get by.  I'd be curious to see whether this happens in games with more players as well.

This is a light, fun game that plays fast, although it may take a couple games before you get how to play well.  Know that there will be some turns during the game where you won't be doing a whole lot and others where you might move half the ships around.

We had a game once where almost all the islands were either connected in a big land mass or by zero routs. Then on the last turn of the game, Paul pulls a 10 minute (no joke) sailing/reorganizing adventure that results in a 20 point swing and brought him the victory.

The cut-throat nature of this game is what appeals to me.  The placing of opponents pieces on "dead ends" after a migration is satisfying.  The sacrifice of your piece with others through those dead ends to give you a royal monopoly on the island is even better.  I think there are a fair number of decent decisions to make during the game, and it reminds me of bridges of Shangri-la, only with the ability to move your opponents pieces.

Cute theme but not overly compelling...actually...that makes it sound much too good...  Playing in a large group also made the game extremely chaotic which didn't help. Most of the game is out of your control in this, and it feels more like an activity than a game.

Islands and 4.50EUR? I was sold. But this is a lot of fun, and plenty of screwing each other over by deliberately setting sail when there's likely to be death and destruction ahead!

The tiles really need shuffling tho. Perhaps some house rules for how they are drawn could make it interesting? Not sure it's much of a problem though.

Interesting concepts and a nice treatment of an exploration theme, but these don't mask what feels like a very chaotic game at its heart.  Too often I find myself making a move only to set up the next person for a really big move leaving me in the exact same position next time my turn comes.  Some may say that this goes away with experience and different numbers of players, but I have a reasonable sample of games under my belt with the full range of suggested players and find the game the same each time.  The game is interesting to watch, but the lack of the control really turns me off.

RATING: 3
I hadn't played Tongiaki in a good while, but when it hit the table I immediately made up my mind to degrade it. It is simply too chaotic and random to be much fun. Oh, I like the subject and the presentation (although the boats are easily knocked over and the beaches are too crowded, obscuring how many moorings there are), but the game seems to be lacking. In quite a number cases players will find themselves without a possibility of getting a lot of boats onto the islands. They are then out of the game, completely unable to threaten the position of someone who does have a lot of tongiaki. They have no say where they end up, being dispersed as dandelion seeds before the wind. Add to this the brutal luck factor which can leave you with impassable ocean and/or crummy islands, or the exact opposite. I have seen games where the point ratio of the winner versus the loser was in excess of 3 to 1: that simply leaves no other explanation save a bad game design. Tongiaki feels like it ought to work, and it is disappointing to learn that it doesn't.

[b]Update[/b] Sold off this game, I didn't feel like continuing courting with chaos.

[b]Update 2[/b] After a replay several years later I revisited this comment. First I dropped the rate several notches, though to be honest I'm not sure whether I'm not being too lenient with the current value. I was of course completely right in selling off this chaotic turd: anno 2015 it would have made perfect Kickstarter material. It makes me wonder how this design ever got through playtesting. The chaotic nature can easily knock people out of the game very early on; and once people claim isles for themselves you might as well throw in the towel. Not only do these things block expansion, they also bring in sure VPs which other players cannot quickly match. 

The game ought to be modified [i]at the very least[/i] with a rule that if a group of ships 'sinks', the boats [i]not[/i] of the active player's colour get returned to the isle from which they came: in many cases players have little say in where they end up on the mooring posts anyway, and losing their ships because someone else decided he was feeling lucky is really way too harsh. But it won't be me experimenting with this design: usually the need for such experimentation indicates that one's time is better spent on designs which work out of the box.

This tile-laying game reminds me a bit of Hey, That's My Fish! in that you're trying to do your best to leave as many travel routes open as possible.  You also get echoes of Tikal in that you try to isolate an island so you can claim it.

A nice little game that falters with 2 players (but I just found out about the official 2p variants).  But works really well with 4 players.  Attractive components and easy to learn rules.  For the price point, this was a good choice to add to our shelf.

RATING: 3
Horrible as a 2 player game, even with the new rules, and I don't see it getting a whole lot better with more players.  Felt like the biggest decision I made in the game was what color to be. (Blue, in case you are wondering.)  Too much luck and chaos.  Pretty pieces though.

RATING: 6
For the love of whatever deity you hold dear: if you play this with fewer than four players, lower the route numbers by one! (Or, if you're feeling callous, don't, and play a game about explorers being sent to their watery doom.)

And: if you like building up a good board position for yourself in games, don't play with 5-6 players. There's still relevant skill on your turn, but your board position will change [i]completely[/i] from turn to turn in ways you have absolutely no control over.

Production: I didn't like the tiles as much as I thought I would; the colors aren't quite right for my tastes.  The components are sturdy, but the boats obscure the moorings with their size, and I would have preferred a larger font size on the number value for each island.

Play: Chaos!  This reminded me of Dos Rios, wherein by my next turn I didn't even recognize the playing field, and had little idea where my own pawns were, because so much had changed.  The cascading launch mechanism was only interesting if I were the one initiating it; otherwise it was either despairing or boring to watch another player send my ships on suicidal missions, or scatter them to remote and worthless islands.

Tactical game in which the other players moves can have a huge impact on your score. When played fast, it is ok though. Keeps getting better with more playings, don't give up on it ! Works best with just 2 players in my opinion, however the starting player always has a pretty big advantage. In a 2player game letting the second player start with 3 ships might be a fix.

After playing this game incorrectly for the first few tries, once we figured out that all beaches needed to be filled first and then on expansion only one boat could be placed per beach, I found this game enjoyable. There are times in this game when one player may have the ability to break away from opponents if they are lucky enough to get one of their boats to reach an island alone, and there is some luck with the choosing of the tiles, but overall I enjoyed the mechanics of this game. There is a good defensive/offensive blend to playing and it feels like it has been well thought out in production.

RATING: 5

It's fun and there's some strategy, but the game is has wildly lucky (or unlucky) tile draws.

Haven't tried two-player yet: other tile-laying games work better with just two, since the randomness evens out more (due to more total moves per player)... so this might be better with two, too. Or a tutu.

Nice pieces, but chaotic play with very little control of your destiny. Probably our group was too eager to launch expeditions because the game was over pretty fast too.

This is not the type of game that I typically like that much.  But something about this game gets me.  I think it is the fluidity of it.  The pieces tend to flow around the board hopping from one island to the next. It's not area influence-ish at all. There's a good amount of strategy to this...especially when you throw in royal islands...and how ships that sail to them are returned and redistributed.  I'm on the fence on whether to buy it though.  I'm a little worried that it may wind up being a game that you can get done-in by things that happen between your turns...through no fault of your own.  Need to play it again (1 play so far).

Somewhat chaotic, but I enjoy the chain-reaction effect, and I think there's still a fair bit of strategy (spreading out vs. building up, going for royal islands or not).  Less chaotic with fewer players.  It's a pain to keep having to pick up the boats to see how many moorings are on an underlying beach and where the docks are; I love the big wooden boats, but would have preferred something smaller and more functional (or maybe larger tiles, or something).

You have to trade off between building up in ability to get ships onto the board and putting the ships in places where they will score you points. You only have so many ships, which can further limit how much you can build up.

There are a bunch of niggly little rules to handle odd situations, yet the exact requirements when distributing boats on an island after landing are not clear.

I'd definitely like to play this again. I think it fills a light game niche in my collection. It's light, but not a card game, and not overly dominated by randomness, despite having quite a bit of it. Maybe I'll change my mind after more plays, but it really sems to be pretty good about the randomness.

Odd, but still reasonably good, with 2. Using both new 2-player official rules.

The only randomness is the draw of the tile(s) when you set sail; this might be a little too random for some; you can get a lucky break and have half the board for yourself. Otherwise, very chess-like in its play. Trying to calculate a complicated series of chain reactions is difficult.

This has become my go-to filler game for groups of 3-5. It's light but not mindless, has a decent amount of screwage potential, and provides just enough randomness to keep everyone on their toes. 

I don't recommend playing this with 6 players since it becomes too difficult to form any kind of strategy--you're basically reacting to whatever your opponents do. There is an alternate 6-player version on the 'Geek, but I haven't gotten a chance to try it out yet.

Played this game with 5.  This is a simple strategy game where every one is messing with everyone else without really being able to develop game plans.

Everyone was tired of the game by the time it ended.

A truely fresh and original game of island hopping.  Simple mechanics yet complicated strategies makes this game fun and accessible.  Works best up to 4.

* Gut Reaction* I have no love for this game.  Maybe it was a bad draw of tiles for game, but until the end the game had very little strategy. It was all water and we were all downing.  You were unable to get a strategy because by the time it was your turn again, nothing was where you left it.  I also can foresee a problem of it there is a very very poor draw in the beginning... you could never even make it off the Tonga Island.

I really want to like this game more than I do, but there is a level of excitement missing in this game. The exploration in the game is fun, but it feels a bit random and after exploring, nothing really happens. You definitely need 4 or more players for this game.

RATING: 3
Ugh.  One of the only lighter games that I've actually begged to end early.  The rules have a very disjointed feeling about them and most of it doesn't feel intuitive.  Also, a lot of time is spent having the game play the players instead of the other way around.  Most of it is just chore-work sending boats to other islands which creates reactions that sends boats to more islands, etc. There are some opportunities to muck with your opponents and get the out of the way, but otherwise this is an auto-pilot game that is clumsy to play and quite boring.

RATING: 5
It's a very beautiful game, and it's interesting trying to manipulate the tongiaki to your own advantage. Plays better with fewer players, as it gets too hard to control when your turns are infrequent. Use the added tribes rules for 2 players, and I would suggest even for 3. I like this game but I have taken a point off my rating for the down-time. Some players have long long turns which they agonise over, while other players get badly screwed early and don't have much to do for long periods.

Acquired December 2005; first played February 2006. Very entertaining game, based on one play. Lots of "random" effects -- blind tile draw; essentially cannot predict when game will end; other players move your boats, not necessarily when and where you want. But, during your turn, you can often make some educated guesses about your best move. There probably is more strategy to the game than I understand at this time.

May 2009 -- I would like to play this game a couple of more times, to see whether I can really get into it. But, my son-in-law really doesn't care for it, so I'm not sure whether it will get more plays.

October 2009 -- Played once more recently. I still enjoy it, but think I would need to play it often in order to get a better feel for the best moves.

Well, the game looks nice and can be had for crazy cheap thanks to Tanga.  Even so, I didn't find it too interesting.  The board and pieces change so much between turns that you really can't plan or anything.  It's okay, but there are far better offerings out there I think.

This has got to be the worst game I've played in a long, long time.  It doesn't even make sense.  It's a pointless exercise similar to watching bacteria multiply in a petri dish.  "I think I'll put my boat on this beach and your boat on that beach because . . . well . . . because 'who cares?'" and later, "Hey, it's my turn to flip a tile and explore.  Whoops, it's a sea path with a four on it.  I guess these boats die!" and later "Hey, is the game over yet?  I don't know.  Count the number of land tiles and subtract from sixteen.  Then do the same for the sea tiles.  Then take the smaller number, and that's how many turns we might have left!"

RATING: 10
This is an excellent fun game. Really nice theme, exploring the pacific on your tongiakis. First, you expand on your island. As the beaches get filled, you take to the sea.... but be careful.... You should never go to the sea alone!! It's risky. The Pacific may not be kind. Then again, it might. 

If you make it across the water and land on additional island, that's great. It will bring you more points. But the others traveling with you will also score points. What do you do? Try to get rid of them, make them sail away, so you have the island to yourself and can make a Royal island grabbing all the points for yourself.

Really neat game. The chain reactions that get triggered as you migrate from island to island are sometimes creazy!! But that's the fun part. If you manage your migrations well, you make people leave your island, while getting your boats on other island and still be in charge in the island you started from. 

Quick game too. You go through stack of tiles and it's over, so it's not like it drags on and on. The situation changes constently and you got to be on your toes all the time. What will you do next? What will others?? Will you make it to the next island??? Try it and you'll see for yourself. 

Love this game!!

So, it looks like you have choices, but that is largely illusory--the chaos undermines any attempt at good play. But it looks like you can optimize your move, which means everyone takes far too long on their turn. I hate games like that.
As a special bonus, this boasts a terrible end-game mechanic which relies on counting to see if there are 16 land or water tiles out. Boo.

RATING: 6.5
It was alright...played 5 player game (everyone else loved it) but i thought it had little control and whenever i was developing strategy someone would do some stupid move for no reason and stuff me up.  Just played 2 player and it is even worse for 2!  I'm gonna give it one more try with 3 or 4 and then give up on it!  OK, after all that I have now played a couple more games with 6 players, and while the lack of control is still there, it does make for a light filler with the feeling that you "may be able to control your destiny", though I think this is mostly a mirage.

I like it. It's a nice little filler which can be played quickly, and without too much thought as the tile draw will decide most of the game. Once about half the tiles are drawn there starts to pop up some strategic options as you can see some paths that will fail/succeed immediately. Also placing yourself to reach more valuable islands is critical in the later half. But much of the action is taking place during other players turns and if you don't like chaos you won't like this.

Interesting exploration, racing, area control game, about island hopping in the South Pacific. I recall not being fond of the game due to the last player (me) being almost always being locked out of landing on a new island. The clockwise turn-order pretty much screws the last player, making it unbalanced, with no catch-up mechanism, so this needs to be fixed before I'd consider playing this again. It's a '7'.

First played this on April 6th, 2007.  The rules are fairly easy to pick up and the game (45min) is pretty quick.  It has a good mix of luck and strategy in this game as well.  We played with three and all agreed it would be more fun with more people.  It always seems to amaze me how the games we play can be totally different than other games.  This one is also unique.  I'd recommend giving this one a game play or two, however it probably will miss being a part of your game rotation.

This is essentially an exploring/area influence game, but it has a unique colonizing mechanism that I really like.  IMHO, the game is underrated.  Some of the lowest ratings are essentially admissions the player could not get their head around the game.  The unique Diaspora colonization mechanism can be used both to get one or more of your guys to an island or to send other players tokens away so that you are in sole control of an island.  Something I always tell first time players is that it is vital in the early turns to pick an island location to build up some numbers before spreading out.  Otherwise your choices will be limited. However, you need to balance this with an attempt to make sure that you are carried with others when they expand so that you are not limited to actions in only one area of the archipelago that is created as the game proceeds.

Ok game, a little confusing at first but after the initial game I enjoyed it. Luck plays a large part in the tile draws and there aren't enough tiles drawn to equalize the luck factor.

I can only imagine that this will be much more interesting and tense with more players.

Polynesian island exploration. My impression after a few games is that this is a reasonably fun game, but nothing really special. The game does suffer from an unhealthy degree of chaos once you play with four or more players, making long-term planning pretty pointless. On the other hand, with three or two players the board becomes too "large" and the game loses quite a bit of player interaction. Exploring uncharted waters is fun initially, but the novelty of that is bound to wear off sooner rather than later.

I only played the actual game once. I love the patterns that can emerge from a series of launched ships, but the actual decisions didn't seem all that interesting.

After 50 plays my rating has gone up.  There is more going on here than first appears.  Lots of sneaky tactics mixed with a little bit of luck (especially in a 2 player game) make this game a lot of fun.

And for those who say that the game is too chaotic and mostly luck driven, play some of the top rated players on BSW... you'll find out in a hurry what good play is like... and why I never seem to win.

But it still doesn't deter me from coming back again and again.  Sure, the luck of the draw can affect play... but name me a game of this type where this doesn't happen.

An easy '8' for me.

It has a few interesting things going, but it was just too random & chaotic for me, and while the launching is initially kind of cool, it gets too fiddly with all the chain reactions once you get a lot of ships.

I feel the game's most serious drawback is the rich-stay-rich mechanics, which ensures that at least one person will have a very bad time of things. This is mitigated by the light nature of the game, it's really only meant as a fun and brainless end of the evening affair, and if one approaches the game with this expectation it can be a riot of random seafaring adventures!

A nice surprise. I wasn't expecting much from Tongiaki with its mediocre rating and reputation for being an odd mix of abstraction and chaos. The four of us actually played it twice in a row. Four players probably is the sweet spot between too much chaos and not enough fun.

Clever and mean moves are possible with the growth action. Discovering the new tiles is a fun push-your-luck element. Watching the landscape grow combined with the ebb and flow of the ships gives a satisfying sense of development. A pleasant light game one step beyond a filler game. Hopefully, none of the players suffers from AP as there's a risk that a player can get hosed early on without a real chance to recover which is ok if the game is concluded in 30-45 minutes.

Game appears to be flawed.  After a few aborted plays we gave up on it.  We kept running into “circular errors” and felt that it needed a bit more time in development to iron out the kinks…  Or maybe we were just playing it wrong…

This game simply didn't come together for us.  Players were hampered by forces far out of their control and we were distressed by the lack of any clear way to adjust the game to fit the number of players.  It's a shame.  At its heart, this game looks like it could have been a real gem.

Played once, then got my own copy!

This is a fun game with an interesting game mechanic: Place boats until the beach fills up, then send them into the abyss! If your ships survive, they end up on other islands, each worth a different amount at the end of the game. There's a touch of evil to the game: when you send your opponents off into the sea alone - or setting off a chain reaction that kicks everyone else off your high-scoring island. Do that at the very end and you're all but guaranteed victory.

After my first play I was a little cold on this game, but two more games and it has grown on me; I really like the chain reactions that one can create in the end-game, as well as the come-from-behind game play. However, this should never be brought out with slow players.

Played twice on BSW, and man do I dislike this game.  Easily the worst Euro that I've played.  The problem is that there is such scope for all of this tactical maneuvering, only to have it blown away by bad tile draws.  Also, in the endgame you can sometimes end up playing an almost endless sequence of moves in order to get yourself that one or two extra points.  This may be a rare occurance, but it happened to me.  YARG!

Tongiaki (a game where you and your fellow players sail boats from Tonga across dangerous waters to other Pacific islands which are worth points if you can keep a boat on there) is a light game and subject to large luck swings: an example is our game, where one set of boats went straight into a 4 color wave and drowned while another swept onto the 5 point beaches of Hawaii. I do admire the mechanic that makes you want to cooperate with your fellow players (if you sail alone, the chance of making it to an island are much lower) so I can take the slings and arrows there, but the sin that Tongiaki does commit is giving players too many turns of doing almost nothing. Turns that go: If I don't play a boat on that island, Rick will sail me away from there and I'll probably drown, so my amazing move is add 1 boat, next player. This is the king of right place at the right time games, where you can do amazing if you hit the waves just right, but for me, my desire to play it again just hit the rocks.

Picked up Fungamescafe Feb 2007 - Arrived Aug 2007

Played Dec 2008, 2 player, once with the basic rules and once with the designer's 2p variants.

I think this game is mostly about spreading out effectively. But I got caught on one side of the board with lower valued islands and it was impossible to spread well enough to catch up. Explaining the mechanics is irritating, but it flows well enough once the game gets going. I liked the variants that added native ships better than not having them. This game may work better with 3 or 4.

RATING: N/A
While this game has been derided by many, Shanon Appelcline suprisingly has much positive praise for this game ("most unreserved selection of 2004") and compares it to Shangri-La: 

"This game reminds me a bit of another recent Uberplay release, The Bridges of Shangri-La. They both share features of a unique movement system which allows all players to move all the pieces across the board, hopefully in a way beneficial to him and not his opponents. Tongiaki is definitely more thematic, but beyond that the difference is in the designers.

Shangri-La is a somewhat dry design. It plays very smoothly and allows for lots of strategy, but it doesn't feel like it takes a lot of chances. It's a conservative design by a seasoned professional. Tongiaki meanwhile has a number of rough edges, but feels very vibrant and innovative. It's a progressive design by a freshman designer. "

Recommended as a 4 player game. However, a number of reviews suggest that it plays much better with 2 (and is less chaotic).

3 players seem to be the sweet spot between control and luck.

It seems that the game plays itself. One reviewer suggested the game be approached like a party game.

Initial impression not that great though not terrible. It's on the chaotic side with a strong luck element in the drawing of tiles. The kids do like the boats and the exploration aspect. For ages 10 on box and I agree, too tough for 8 year olds to make meaningful choices. The 'royal island' rule, skipped with kids, is fairly important to use.

[2-6] It's all about luck and opportunism. Works well with 4. Nothing special with 2 and more than 4 makes it totally uncontrollable. Chaos is a nice element in this game and it can be hilarious when the boats start a loop while migrating. Don't take this game seriously or you will have a bad experience (and a headache!). Just go with the flow and watch how your fellows boats (and yours too) sink. The components look good.

Tongiaki offers a great balance of competition and grit-your-teeth cooperation, with unique mechanics and great-looking tiles.

It also makes perfect use of its random elements, as the way the tiles come up can make for dramatically different types of game. Sometimes everyone is fighting hard for the same real estate, and other times one person winds up on their own archipelago while everyone else struggles in another area.

It's not flashy or well-known, but Tongiaki is a solid, unique Euro.

Beautiful pieces, fun mechanics.  Unfortunately, I feel like the game needs about twice as many turns to fully satisfy...  That's why I bought two copies...

[edit] After a few more plays, I'm still really enjoying the game but think the card count is just right.  I think I'd rather play two games than one really long game - there's too much potential for areas of expansion to dwindle by the end of the regular game so people may be severely cut off by the time the second 32 tiles come out.

Fairly abstract great little tactical game.  I had a lot of fun playing this but I was racked with a few tough decisions.  The mechanics of filling up a beach and then shipping others or yourself off the island to either the open sea (death) if there aren't enough ships to make the trip or to a new island.  There's quite a bit of luck involved with the tile flip but overall the most tactful should win.

I can't help thinking that as a 5 or 6 player game there is a distinct advantage to being the start player so I think that it is better with 4 or less players.

Had this up for trade for a while, since I could never get anyone to play it. Finally tried it last night as a 2player game and was totally blown away--all three games were intense and highly strategic!

Have since played this with more than two, and it's just no fun - this is why I suspect the ratings are low. It is almost exclusively a two player game where you plan for, cause, and react to an interesting system of chain reactions. Otherwise not worth playing.

Has a second set of tiles in the box -- When I bought it, a couple of tiles had glue damage. Rather than replacing just those tiles, Uberplay mailed me out an entire set. I punched out replacements for my damaged tiles only, and just popped the damaged tiles back into the punchcard. Theoretically, since the game is so abstract anyhow, I might buy some small colored stones or wooden pieces at a craft store, and have a complete 2nd set.... If I ever get around to it... Might be fun to have a set of this in the classroom.

Went more than four years without a play. Traded in a lot for Hammer of the Scots.

Plays very fast - so far our games have finished well under 45 minutes.  Draw of the tiles is random (of course), but you can really help yourself by growing your boat population as much as possible before taking to the perilous high seas.  Lowered ranking after seeing too much chaos in subsequent plays.

This is like an area control game except with less control :-)

RATING: 6
The mechanic forces some cooperation (in a multi-player game) which quickly turns into nasty tit-for-tat wars. Great bits and fun game-play, together with some unexpected possibilities turn this into a very good game.

Despite the seeming simplicity I found the rules slightly unclear and misunderstood them which rendered the first few games bizarre.

RATING: 5.5
Players put boats on beaches, then when beaches are full, ships embark on a journey represented by flipping a tile. Island tiles give VPs ranging from 2 to 5. Water tiles have numbers ranging from 2 to 4 representing the number of different players that must have boats on that beach before the journey may continue, otherwise all those boats are destroyed. VPs are scored for those who have presence on islands. We played two games with 5 players and it appeared quite random. Sure you can have fun moving boats to all sorts of different places and triggering more moves. In our games, not all players got an equal number of turns.  The board changed quite dramatically when your turn came around. Maybe this game is like Clans,and plays better with fewer players (2, 3 or 4 players). I would be willing to try with less players, but wasn't much fun with 5 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Mean-spirited and very luck-heavy.  Neither of those things can kill a game by itself, but within Tongiaki's framework, it's a very unattractive combination.

RATING: 4
I wasn't too happy with my first playing of this, but I would like to play more to see if the chaos is as high as I think it might be. If so, the rating could get even worse. I do think there may be something I'm missing, though, so I will keep an open mind. This is a game I really want to like, too. ***UPDATE*** The rating has taken a turn south - this is the gaming equivalent of a slot machine! I put my ships on the board and draw a tile... oh look... all of my ships sank and I'm out of the game from the get go! What fun that was! Please keep this one away from me in the future.

Nice abstract combining a bit of luck with flying under the radar so as not to get targeted. Does fall victim to kingmaking as a victory determinant, like many multi-player area control games (although this one has a twist, with mere presence being sufficient to score).

RATING: 3
Not really impressed. We played a five player game, and the two of us that went 4th and 5th basically didn't get to do anything on our turns. If you get cut off from the lucrative parts of the map or have one of your two initial boats destroyed it's impossible to get back into the game. It's really bad since this can happen even before you get a turn. The chain reaction aspect is interesting, but in practice if you aren't in a position to do it, you're out of luck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting game mechanics. Fun to play although very chaotic in nature even with just 4 players. Game feels nice but nothing very special. Don't trust the box, I haven't tried with more than 4 players but I can see why 5+ players isn't a good idea with this game. Although I'd like to someday try with 6 players just as an experiment... Best with just 3 players actually.

A game that rides 2 tightropes - moves that are quick/easy and those that are long/difficult, and whether luck or decisions dominate the result. Going in knowing this, I enjoy the ride it gives.

Fun, light game.

One downside is the fact that chain reactions can quickly move a winning player down in the ranks, but this is often entertaining to watch. :) Plus, royal islands can be used to localize chain reactions.

The other issue is that random tile draw can certainly help or hurt. Expanding in several directions is the only way to counter this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Still a little undecided about this one. Plays simply enough with a lot of screwage but then also you feel a little out of control quite often.
The open, simple scoring, also means you can easily tell when to end the game and if you're in a good position
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In my opinion, this game sucks for two players unless you play with one of the variants (I haven't).  I don't quite get the strategy yet, other than "don't eliminate yourself from an island" and "try to eliminate your opponents from valuable islands".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
There is a strategy to this game, and it can be a challenge, but it is not the best game I own.  I think it's unique enough to keep around, and to take to the occasional con as a filler, but it isn't the best game ever or anything like that.

Strategy Lite, because there's a great deal of luck, and other players not understanding the goal of the game or the strategy to get there can really ruin your game experience because they can take you down with them.

Increased rating slightly.  While there is a huge level of chaos in this game (other people moving your ships without your permission) it is still enjoyable.  You just have to look at where you have ships concentrated and try to explore new islands.  It is fun to explore and watch ships die as they can't pass through rough sea regions.  The winner feels very random, but it's a light quick game and if you treat it as a filler and laugh at your own misfortunes, it is a good time.

RATING: 9
I love this game. Yes, it can be too random, and it can be completely uncontrollable. 4 players is good, 6 probably too many. With two (and without using variants) it can be a complete killer, or it can be an intricate series of decisions (if I do this, he will have that, and will do the other, so instead I should do something else...) like chess. I have had some amazingly tense 2-players games that left me completely satisfied at the end, some completely chaotic 6-player games where I never even got a turn, and some amazing 4-player games where everyone got into the spirit of the game, had fun, took their lumps, and gave them back in turn.

The game does encourage petty vindictive play in some people. If you take it as a fun, light game, this is no problem: be petty and vindictive too, or try to be more rational in your play, whatever you prefer. Some people however take this badly, so watch your group. Overall I love the game, as it captures very well the risks and the chances of death in interisland voyaging. For those who complain about the randomness of it :YOU try getting into a dugout and sailing a thousand miles across open water and finding landfall before your supplies run out and you have to eat each other! That's one reason you, as the Blue tribe, take the purple tribe along with you: as an emergency larder!

My main complaint (as a Pacific Islander!) is that the islands are painted on the tiles in so generic a design. Why don't they look like maps of the islands they are meant to represent, with a few objects to add to identification: Rapa Nui doesn't look like Rapa Nui for example. It should be triangular, with 3 volcanoes at the corners and some big stone statues on the beach!  A little more realistic geography in the artwork would be so much better (and make it educational to play with kids)....

Buy it, play it and have FUN!

A tactical game. Where you have to be opportunistic. Sort of a reverse area control game, where you must struggle to keep a presence on the more valuable islands, but don't have to keep a lead on the island.

The tile draw with a mix of islands and water paths lends itself to the exploration theme. I like how the water paths encourage having multiple players in the exploration, while the royal island encourage getting the other players off your island.
The chain reaction mechanic is a nice addition as boats can bounce between islands reallocating who is on top.

As a two player game use the 2 variants more initial boats and an additional boat per new island. 

As you get to 5 or 6 players the chaos that introduces makes the game almost unmanageable, and less enjoyable.

this is a good tile laying game that reminds me a little bit of clans. they both kind of feel the same to me in that a play involves scoring opportunities for more than just the active player. the active player in both games has to try to maximize the score for themselves during their turn while trying to score minimal points for the opposing players.</br>  
my rating reflects play with two players. one must seek out the official two player variant(s) here on the geek. I like playing with both sets of rules for the two player varients. it gives the game a little more depth.</br>
my rating might go up with more plays and with more players in the mix. right now though, i think this gets a seven from me, while clans gets an 8.</br>

The exploration aspect of Tongiaki is different than anything I have played. I enjoy that part.  But, as the game goes on, and there are a ton of ships out on the board, each player's move can take forever.  I played with six people and it was very slow waiting for my turn.  The neat part of this is that if you notice a move that you can make and there are still three or four people who have to take turns, it can be very tense.

Six is too many for this game because it makes it chaotic.

The box says it supports two players, and maybe I was just missing something, but, it REALLY does not support two players. There is another variant to use which makes it "better" for 2, but even that seems to fail. If you intend to mostly play with 2, PASS ON THIS ONE.

Era um dos jogos que mais esperava por ter e, talvez por isso, não posso dizer que tenha superado as expectativas. Os componentes, embora apenas tiles e barcos, são fantásticos, pois tanto o corte de uns, como o formato dos outros, nunca haviam sido vistos; a jogabilidade, de 2 a 6 jogadores, é também um factor positivo, dada a sua versatilidade, numa amplitude geralmente apenas registada em party games; e a mecânica, é engraçada, embora não tão fluída como deveria ser, nem tão independente da sorte quanto seria desejável. No final obtemos uma mesa muito bonita e colorida, que respeita o tema do jogo e que, regra geral, até acaba por dar a vitória a quem jogou melhor; ainda assim, falta-lhe qualquer coisa para poder ser um jogo bestial...

This game is much better with the maximum number of players of 6.  In fact, the game becomes all most unplayable with less than 4 players and even 4 is pushing it a bit.  The game is a bit too chaotic as you don't really have much control of where your ships go.  Everyone else does instead.

If this little gem is not underrated then what? An ingenious design that fits perfectly with the theme! I read many comments when I was thinking to buy it and now that I got it I am really amazed how people can miss on so many things in a game. I understand that it is not a game for everyone but some things just don't make sense.
My first play was against a friend that has little experience with board games but a good understanding and he used to be very good at chess. After just 4 or 5 rounds he said: "Wow this one is amazing!". After the end of the game he noted that with more players it would be a very different game. 
Nevertheless we tried it 3 and 4 player with other people most of them new to board games. While it was a very different game indeed, it did not fail with anyone. Everyone liked it at the very least. Some liked it because it had simple rules, fast play and they noticed they got better at it with every play. Others liked it because of the cutthroat moments. Some liked it because of the moments of laughter. Some liked it for its gambling moments. Everyone found something to like.
I like it for many reasons.
 I like its theme and how the mechanics promote it.
 I like that when it is finished I never really care if I won or lose. I enjoyed the play and that is a win by itself.
I like the components. 90 boat meeples for the price is a bargain by itself.
I like its diversity. A highly tactical 2 player game, that is not won before it is finished. Sometimes it reminds me of chess, force moves, tempo play, stall to take advantage. A game of tactical back and forth until a migration occurs. A short break of luck and then back to tactics as you need to respond to the new condition. None can maintain a hugely superior position for long. The mechanics provide the catch up, and the leader can't end the game by himself so he needs to slow down eventually. With more players the game changes, and with every additional player tactics diminish and the game becomes unpredictable. In two player game you can respond when the opponent puts a threat on you. But with more players you just can't respond to everything and the decisions are harder. There is still strategy and tactics, a very different one though. Some people seem to fail to see them because of that difference. But yes, in the end with more players it is more likely that best play won't win. Many people find that disturbing. I don't mind because I still have fun and also I think of it as a poker match. You may lose a hand no matter good you may play but in the long run you will win more than you'll lose if you do it right. Many games that include luck try to mitigate it by proposing a "play to 3 wins, or 5 wins", That is not possible with Tingiaki and thus it is not apparent.
To conclude I think this one may be my best purchase regarding how it costed me. I see it for less than 10 Euro in GM... That is giveaway for this game.
People that play to have fun will love it, because it provides many great moments. People that play to win will probably hate it because it will allow many victories to outsiders. But I believe that even those can get what they want if they stick to 2-player plays.

RATING: 5
A little crazy, but once you get the idea then there's some fun to be had. The end game can be a bit lucky for the player who triggers it. Worth exploring further as a 30 minute starter for the evening. Not too heavy and not too light. Maximum of four players, otherwise it's just too chaotic - three might be best.

A strong 8 with the caveat that the players need to know what they are getting themselves into.  The chaotic nature of the game needs to be understood, but also that there are proper tactical choices to be made - it's not all about the luck of the tiledraw; with 3 or 4 at least.
The good part is that the game works with 5 or 6 as well, although the outcome will generally be far more random in that case.

This rating after one 4 player game, with the other players complaining that a six player game is even worse.  I doubt I'll play it again.  There's pretty much no control and there aren't many tough decisions.  It doesn't even make for a very good light game (IMO) because there is downtime between turns and it happens often that your turn will hold no excitement (i.e., no journeys).

Connection, Area Control (sorta). After just one 2p game of this, I really, really like it. Relatively simple mechanics that produce a fairly rich set of tactical decisions. At an hour of gameplay, I don't know if this is a meaty filler or a pleasurably light middleweight game -- but either way, I like it. :thumbsup:

Update: played this 3p and 4p. I still like it. It is a little more chaotic, but you can still make sound decisions to manage the placement of your tongas and your expansion strategy. Tile draws can be lucky, but I still feel satisfied after a play. We have this down to a solid 30 minutes or less, which is great for lunch.

Traded. My copy never came out and I have plenty of stuff at this weight class.

RATING: 7
A fun, light exploration/tile game.  Very competitive, and has a definite "screw your neighbor" factor, though also has the unique twist of often requiring forced cooperation (by "forced", I don't mean the mechanics make you, but rather to succeed yourself, sometimes you need to help someone else out as well, at least temporarily).

An interesting combination of cooperation and competition.

Light and Random.  Cool Components.  By all rights though this game should be nothing to write home about.  There are moments in the game where you watch everything you built up just go into the drink (litteraly).  Sometimes it can take a while for your turn to come around as the chain reactions can consume a huge portion of player's turns.  It really is more of a chaotic abstract game than anything deep.  Yet, it is great nasty fun.  I have to say that I just enjoy playing it.  The mechanics are downright neat, and the concept and light theme work really well, with its abstract nature, so it doesn't feel absolutely pasted on.  I don't know if I can recommend it, but I wouldn't ever pass up the opportunity to play it.  I suspect my rating will go up with more plays (and it has).

RATING: 7
[Update 2] Lowered to 7.  The more I play the more I realize problems with the game.  Play on BSW reveals this as gameplay is so quick.  There can be time when you sit for 10 minutes while your opponent makes move after move after move.

[Update 1] Rating raised from 8.  Under-rated gem.  This really is a clever game that is super easy to learn but difficult to play strategically.  Definitely for 3 or 4 players only.  Have not yet tried to 2-player variation, however.  Avoid playing with 5 or 6 due to increasing lack of control.  Unfortunate that nobody wants to play it on BSW.

I've owned this one for quite a long time, but have never played it until recently.  After a few plays I have really come to enjoy it!  It is quite an interesting game that demands a unique strategy.

Played on game with 3 players. Better than expected. Played with 2 non-gamers and they liked it too. I Liked how the board expands during play and how your ships ships spread from island to island. Felt thematic and has a nice exploring-element to it. I need to play this some more to decide how much the winner is determined by the tile draw and if there are any deeper tactics to the game.

After second play: This game is far too random.

RATING: 8
A really unique blend of both cooperative and competitive aspects. To discover new lands, you need as many players as possible, but once an island is discovered, you want to get rid of everybody else there! For this simplicity of mechanics (just 15 ships per player plus the land and ocean tiles), a very nicely playable game.

A cool little game that looks good (colourful and good quality components), is easy to learn, and quick to play.  It does permit some tactical decision-making - although luck and others' play can often derail bigger strategy - and uniquely combines (at different times) cooperation with other players and causing them to drown in the Pacific Ocean.  May have some bias for the first player to win, but still good fun (and a great first game design).

Exploration/area-control game. Send boats off on journeys that succeed if there are boats from enough different players (depending on the water tile flipped). Some interesting play in how you distribute boats amongst the beaches, and how you set up chain reactions to get control of islands (worth 2-5 VP). With too many players, though, this becomes very chaotic -- wouldn't play with more than 4.

Tongiaki is really a pure abstract. The way that exploration proceeds and areas are settled has no analog in the real world.

I'm sure it can be played at a fairly high skill level, as small tactical choices are provided in abundance. I'm afraid I have too little interest to reach proficiency, though. I'll play the game if somebody else wants to, but it's unlikely I'll ever suggest it.

[1 play] Initial reaction.  My game judgement might be unfair as I only played it two player, and this game might work better with more players.  It just didn't seem to click well, and is what I would call just an "average" game.  It seemed too often you would get a migration and flip over the next piece, it might be great it might be nothing.  There was some strategy in how you allocate your new ships and how you position the ships on an island after a migration, but overall the game just felt kind of odd to me.  I wouldn't mind trying it again with maybe 4 players, but really have my doubts if that will sway my opinion of this being just kind of a medium game.

Nice components but ranks as the most boring game that I have played. I gained absolutely no satisafaction from winning as it was about exciting as throwing a die.

It's not especially clever and there is far to much fiddling around moving ships here there and everywhere else, to be worth the effort.

Part way through the third attempt, we all looked at eachother, yawned and wholeheartedly agreed to ditch it and wake ourselves up with an adrenaline packed game of Ricochet Robots. 

I've tried it twice since and with certain variations and ended up ditching the game on both occassions.
Steer well clear of this.

Very pretty game, and caters well to my desire to simulate ocean exploration by turning over tiles (first discovered in Seafarers of Catan).

This game is kind of fun, but it has a fairly big drawback.  In each game, at least one player seems like they will simply be out of the running by no fault of their own, sometimes starting before they even get a turn!  That can leave a bad taste.  The chain reactions can be very cool, but they also seem to give a lot of power to one or two players, and one or two seem to be constantly losing boats.

Components and art are excellent. It looks magnificent. The rules are simple but the game is hard to grasp with respect to what to do to win. The first couple of times you will be puzzled about what to do to win. Everything will look random to you. But there is quite a bit of strategy and if you really get into to it, you will discover that this is a hidden gem. Of course you need to convince another 2 people that this is a game worth playing ... but this another story. Due to the intricate game mechanics that at first look like they have a lot of luck, I give it a 7, but it is a game worth of 8! (I never give half point ratings!!!)

Despite what it says in the summary, I did not find this game easy to explain at all! There seem to be quite a few rules that feel abstract and not very instinctive.

I find these types of games where you discover new lands at personal risk to be fun.  However, this game seems to have problems with two players.

The level of randomness involved, amount of strategy (read: nothing that isn't blindingly obvious), and mechanic of laying tiles to move along paths reminds me vaguely of Tsuro.

I was doubtful about how well this would play as a 2 player game and had already thought of how I would modify the rules to make it work before I played.  I was pleasantly suprised however when the game played very nicely without any modifications.  I'm sure it's more interesting with more players but there are some effects with 2 players that probably don't show up in a multiplayer game.  There is certainly one advantage to more people the game is probably shorter and this was at the edge of how long a game of this variety should play.  All in all still an excellent game.  The game is easy to learn, basically on a turn you have 3 choices, 1) turn an island only you are on to be a royal island (no one else can land there), 2) remove all your boats and start turning over tiles and placing them until you found a new island, 3) add to an island a number of boats equal to the number you already have there. Then populate them on the beaches, no more than 1 to a beach.  If you fill a beach migrate, i.e. found a new island more or less.  Put the boats on that island.  When all tiles are gone score points for each island you are on.

Rating after 2 plays. I was not playing too well at all. I played with a group of 6 and a group of 3. With 3 players, it was too analytical and that particular analysis was not something intuitive to me. As well, our game took about 1 hour. With 6 it was absolute chaos and the game finished in about 20 minutes. Personally, for this game, I would much rather prefer chaos to the hard analysis. However, it would warrant more plays (though I suspect my rating won't change that much).

I REALLY REALLY want to like this game because its mechanic is very unique and interesting but it just brings in too much chaos, so that you really can't plan ahead of when it is immediately your turn, which in turn also causes a "downtime between players turns" factor since you have nothing to think about in the meantime.

300 AD: The Polynesians embarked on daring sailing trips and explored thousands of Pacific Islands. Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis. With a unique tile design never seen in any other game(hexes with wavy edges), this game is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.

I've been so impressed by this game! It's so inconscpicuous but it holds all the best: beautiful piece of work, simple rules and fantastic strategic aim. a lot of interaction and positive planning. however there are some drabacks as well: too small tiles, uneven level of fun according to the number of players, planning only possible during your turn, vicious circles on the water ;)

Too much happens beyond a players control in a game with more than two people making it highly tactical.  It's chaotic, but fun.  In a two-player game, there's more control and strategy.

Tactical tile laying game. Fill your beaches and conquer the area. You either love it or you hate it.

This is another of the very few games my wife and I both enjoy. The tactical decisions are often interesting. I haven't played it enough to determine if there's actually any really long-term strategy that can be implemented; if I ever conclusively determine that there's not, this may drop a point or two in my esteem.

RATING: 6
One of the toughest games in my collection to rate fairly. After playing, I'm equally as likely to seek out a garbage compactor as I am to ask for a second game.  There are opportunities for meanness and semi-strategic play, but mostly it's a full marathon of luck and happenstance.

Winners shouldn't brag, certainly, as chaos theory tells us that seemingly innocent actions lead to dramatically different results.

[i]Update[/i]:

The one decision that really mattered was whether to keep the game.  Nope!

Still, I'd play again without much arm-twisting.

Very chaotic. You add boats to islands and try to spread out to new islands. You must go with others or your boats will usually sink. Hard to plan ahead.

RATING: 5
Played mostly on BSW, mostly with 2 or 3 players. Some ideas are quite nice. A minor problem is the length of some individual player turns - the order of actions during the busy turns can be quite tricky too get. It would not be too bad if the whole carefully-planned turn could not be ruined by the luck of the draw.

Lots of chaos, leading to good fun. Can be pretty random, but having a massively chaotic turn that turns the game upside-down from a 15-move combo is very, very satisfying!

Pretty good. I won the game I played. Very pretty game. Lot of chaos near the end. The theme melds well. I imagine each game can play very different.

Interesting tile laying exploration game like so many others.  This one has very specific procedures for how new tiles are laid so the exploration process is less controllable.  I like this feature.  Also, players have the ability to control other players pieces which is very interesting.  Much care is needed to protect your settlement on an island.  It is a winner.

This is usually the second game that I use to introduce new people to the world of boardgames. This game has a wonderful co-op element in moving through ocean tiles but n the end each person wants to be the only one left on the island. 
I really love the element of moving ships around arangaing them to go out and explore or sending setting up to send other players off to sink. However I don't think many people understand the end game, but then again I usually use this game with new players to boardgames so it may be a function of that more than people not understanding the end game.

Quite a lot of semi-controlled chaos.  The pieces and board an wonderfully colorful and attractive, but the gameplay can often be a bit to luck-bound.  That said, I've found the most satisfying games to be the 3 or 4 player games that I've had.

One play with 2 that went super quick, not as many choices easy to get off on your own and get stuck but game play flies. Another play with 3, a lot more choices, can lead to analysis paralysis for some I think, not sure I would play it with people who are prone but I would play again for sure!

RATING: 6
A nice blend of area majority and exploration.  I actually thought the rules weren't all that simple, at least it took my group quite a while to understand that you must assign a boat to each of the beaches first before you can fill the rest up how ever you wish.  Then there was the problem that the tiny depictions on the tiles are often confusing as to which direction(s) the beach is connected to.

A decent game that allowed some clever tactics, but doesn't really do anything different enough to warrant owning it or the occasional plays.

RATING: 9.5
I love strategic games with simple rules.
As such, this game is one of my all-time favourite 2-person games.

It is not that heavy, but you still need careful planning in order to win that game. With 2 players, you can anticipate your opponent's possible moves quite well and prepare for them. Not only speading your own ships is crucial, but you have to make sure to push your opponent off the valuable islands and preferrably to drown them.

At the same time the game balances well once players run out of meeples, so that weaker players won't get totally defeated. Occasional players may like that the game looks less strategic and "frightening" due to the colourful game design. And due to luck-based distribution of new tiles, you can always blame them on losing the game. ;-)

I plaid the game only a few times with 3-4 players:
Once the third player was a fan of strategic games as well, so the game plaid still strategic but less plannable. If all players play well, this may become a nice and complex multiplayer game.

Once the third and fourth player were less strategic. Due to their (to me) more random moves, the game turned a lot more luck-based, which spoiled it a bit for me.
At the same time, reading from other reviews, the "take that" atmosphere may be exactly what people appreciate at this game in multiplayer mode.

By the time you start forming a strategy in your head the games already over. The complaint that it basically plays itself is true. We played it with two and three players and figured it must work better with more. We played it with five and figured it must not work at all.

I want to like this game more than I actually do. It's a really unique and interesting game, but not quite sure I find it fun. It can be endlessly frustrating as you have no control while your oponents sink all your ships, and going last seems to be painfully difficult.

Need to play this more to really get the hang of it.  There are elements of it I don't like - like the possibility of having an island with spots for up to 3 ships, linked to another island with a 4-ship trail.

Variant to try: when expedition finds a new land, active player distributes the tongiakis, but when expedition comes back to a already occupied island, each player may place their own tongiakis. Active player may decide other players order and also when he places his tongiakis. Then again, this is less nasty :)

Better game than Mauri gives it credit for :)

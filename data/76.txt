Just plain fun. Cute plastic planes to push around. There are some game balance issues which revolve around the number of players and the board layout. But overall, this is a fun wargame disguised as an airline business game.

This is one of my favorite games to play when my friends come back home!  I'm on my third copy due to my chits wearing out, and I have 2 copies in reserve the I hope will take me to the end of my life.  There is a lot of randomness, but with 5 and six players the game is a lot of fun, and even the person in last has a chance to submarine the person in first place, or get hot with the dice and get back into it with a little fare wars!

Fun with the right number of people--played LOTS in college.  However, fewer people means whole sections of the board are removed, so it starts limiting the strategy.  All about the dice, also--if dice hate you (like they hate me), get ready for some agony.

{1 play • 5 players} Finally played this old classic.  Some cool mechanisms that still hold up today... but they're marred by the fact that you must constantly gang up on the leader in the second half, and, even worse, sometimes your best move is to hammer the guy in last... and being in last is somewhat unrecoverable.  Too bad, as I really like the theme.  Maybe better with fewer players?

A war game disguised as an ecomomics game.  You have to be comfortable with dice rolls determining your fate, but over time things average out.

Buy those Jumbo jets and international routes.  Don't start those fare wars until you've got the money to ride it out.

A fun game.  Always play with advanced rules, as the basic game feels like a very random version of Monopoly.  There is still a large portion of "luck of the draw" with chit-pulls and luck from the dice driven takeovers.

Wow, what a brutal experience.  There is [i]so[/i] much randomness to this game that solid play just can't account for it all.  Let's see here: random payoff draws can feed your stiffest competitor while you starve.  You can enter "fare wars" (thus forfeiting your opportunity to earn money) and then get worked over by a randomly-determined turn order.  You can achieve dominance of a hub, only to see it vanish quickly in a roll of the dice.

Jumbo jets can be purchased to double the payoffs for specific routes.  However, you're more likely to place them on the cheapest (and therefore most vulnerable) routes that you own, to protect them from takeovers.  Losing a route can cause you to lose dominance or even control of a hub (most or all of its attached domestic routes).  Losing control will cause you to lose market share, which is the primary means towards winning the game.  The war can be lost for the want of a nail.

Due to this extreme volatility, the game can take a long time to complete.  Still, there is something attractive in its simplicity, which is surprising for an Avalon Hill game.  The rules aren't as "fiddly" as many of their other entries.  I'm considering adding some house rules to mitigate the randomness, such as bidding for turn order, and adding "phases" à la [i][thing=2651]Power Grid[/thing][/i] that would allow for drawing more payoff counters.  I think there could be a fantastic game under the skin, if I can find the time to uncover it.

Similarities to Monopoly.  Shows it's age (1996) with chit pull for turn order and income.

Others say:  Too much luck -- luck of the dice, luck of the income pull, luck of the turn order chit pull.  Also, the game tends to grind to a halt after an initial burst, especially with 5-6p, which is supposed to be best.  Lots of waiting for your turn (and then hoping for good chit pulls or die rolls) and it's a ~3h game.

Played once in a pick-up game with some guys at a game shop.  I had fun, but I'm not sure that this game is worth revisiting.  There are ways to improve one's chances, but the out come feels a bit to influenced by luck.  It also feels like it could generally run longer than I will usually prefer.

Thoughts after first play:  An old classic, feels somewhat like Merchant of Venus to me even though the game play is not at all similar.  Fiddly, but I don't mind.  Played it yesterday for the first time and dreamt about it all last night -- a definite keeper!  (Rating 8)     Thoughts after second play:  Still interesting, but luck plays too strong a role for my taste.  Winner of our game went from about 160 to enough market share to win as the result of one turn with about 10 successful takeovers.  I'll still play it every once in a while, but I don't think I need to own it.  (Rating 6.5)  Third play reinforces opinion after second play.

The theme of [b]Air Baron[/b] is to create a modern day airline.  It reminded me of a game called [b]Aerobiz[/b] for the [i]Sega Genesis that[/i] I my friends and I use to play.  It was a great video game, so I was immediately attracted to AB.

Although AB has an economic theme, game play is akin to a war game, because game play largely revolves around aggressively taking control of your neighbour's routes, which is done through rolling dice with modifiers.  Game play can bog down when a player loses due to some bad dice rolls.

Profit is earned from holding routes, but the routes which earn are determined by random draws.  However, careful planning can minimize the luck involved.

I like AB, but I enjoy games with random chance and luck.  AB is an old school Ameritrash game where many of the mechanics of the game is determined by random chance.  Although there are ways to minimize the effect of luck, AB has a [i]Risk[/i] like feel to the game.

Great game to play with 5-6 players, not bad with fewer.  Different strategies, but if the dice hate you you'll just have to live with it. Play with the optional disasters including the oil shocks as this is the one sure thing to prevent a runaway leader situation.  Finishable in 2-3 hours unlike many other empire building wargames.

Surprisingly decent game.  I wasn't expecting much given that it is an Avalon Hill game from right before they went bankrupt.  Interesting tension between taking the safe but slow expansion route or gambling on hostile takovers; of course towards the end you have no choice but to conduct takeovers to win.  What keeps it from being more than just "decent" for me is the amount of luck in the income phase.  If one player lucks into several turns where they get substantially more income than the other players (because their chits are drawn), they can pull away and it becomes very difficult to catch them without a combined, concerted effort by all the other players and that just makes the game drag on way too long and sucks all the fun out of it.  When the income draws are evenly distributed though, the game can be very tense and entertaining.  Unfortunately, it seems like the distribution gets skewed more often than not.  So, it's merely "OK" for me: I'll play it if someone really wants to, but I won't suggest it myself and I see no reason to keep it in my collection.

I do agree that this plays out with a "wargame feel".  Once a player gets total control of a few hubs (and with some payouts), things can be leveraged into a winning possitions.  Sort of like taking land/space/zones in a wargame . . . the one with the most is able to take more "land" (airport connections) from weaker neighbors.
It takes a few turns before the mechanics work for new players.

I played a game where a player "almost won" but did not finish the task (let another turn go) so the others "pulled him back" so the game went on & on . . . but it was fun throughout.

RATING: 8
Although I'm not much of wargamer (chits make me itch, and I'd rather read about history then relive and replay it), this pseudo wargame is great in my book. With a random  draw-a-chit from a cup, with the airplane hub theme pasted on, it looks like a great economics game, but  when you declare "fare wars", you realize deep down you're not undercuting your airline competitors with great bargains to the customer, but distributing machine guns to your ticket agents and pointing them in the directions of the annoying "discount airline" competitor.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Solid game. 

The economy is driven by a chit pull payment system that is pretty capricious. Take overs and growth come through investment or, more likely, through a very wargamey dice-off with a handful of modifiers along the lines of “surround and seize.” Victory conditions were close to zero sum as players fought for market share. 

The best part of the design was the “fare wars” mechanism. At the start of your turn our could either go into or leave “fare wars.” While there you receive no income from payouts but you get a big modifier to help with takeovers and can continue to push your luck and make multiple takeover attempts per turn. It’s lovely. I feel like boiled one of my favorite elements of Food Chain Magnate down to its essentials far more efficiently. Managing cash flow and overhead and deciding when and how long you could afford to bleed was delightful. 

I would definitely play again, but Irish Gauge remains the best "chit" pull economic game.

Unless you're one of those gamers that can't stand it when a roll of the dice or a random chit draw interferes with your ability to demonstrate how intellectually superior you are to other players, Air Baron is a very fun economic/wargame hybrid full of some pretty wild swings of fortune and risky gambles.  The only problem I really have with it is that it can be repetitious if players take too long.  Keep it light and play quickly, and it can be a blast.  Deserves a better reputation than it seems to have, although it does seem a little antiquated at this point.

RATING: 7
It's amazing how well Air Baron reinterprets wargaming mechanics to simulate the ebb and flow of the airline business; its appeal is in large part its emergent narrative.

To be fair, the game does have fair share of random (and retro) elements, which will not be to everyone's liking. These elements can all be controlled to some extent; for example, a key decision is when to switch from spreading out to maximize income to consolidating to facilitate takeovers. But there is no doubt that luck in income draws can keep a player from getting out of the gate, that turn order draws can make an otherwise well-timed Fare Wars extra painful, or that dice go a long way toward your ultimate success. Perhaps the most annoying luck-based element is the frustratingly blunt oil chit for reining in the leader, which sometimes leads to an uninteresting turtling strategy.

The game is also longer than suits its nature, often running 30 minutes to an hour past when decisions are tense and interesting (and even longer if the oil chit shows up too often), and after some players have been effectively eliminated. But in general, it offers significant simulative and thematic value.

Airlines vie for control of the American skies in this hybrid business/war game. Each turn, the active player decides whether make an investment or, to forgo income for a round and enter Fare Wars. In Fare Wars, players pay and roll dice to take over individual spokes to control major-city hubs. Income is generated by randomly drawing purchased spokes and controlled hubs. When a player, on their turn with no outstanding loans, has a mix of market share and cash on hand that equals or exceeds the winning target (which varies with number of players), that player wins.

Great game, just wished i had pulled it off my shelves and onto the table sooner!
The early game, with the purchasing of spokes can feel a little boring, but that's just the setting up. once the takeovers start, the game can get quite tense. It's all about knowing when to start Fare Wars (if at all) and manipulating the odds in your favor.
Great game that's probably not know.

Enjoyed my first game of Air Baron. Looking into getting my own copy.

I played it for the first time at the Granby 2008 meeting. Another great Avalon Hill game in my opinion. Like any Avalon Hill, Air Baron can take a couple of hours to play. 

Basically Air Baron is the conquest of the US with economic twists. It's worth looking into. The mechanics of the game is very interesting. Are you at peace or at war during your turn? Which city(cities) are you going to try and take over? Is there going to be a disaster during the turn? If so, at what cost and who will profit the most? Lots can happen during a round of play. It ain't over till it's over. Anyone can win.

As I recall, I didn't finish the game since I went bankrupt. The other players finished the game without me. Looking forward to play this again sometime. Although I know only one person who owns this game. So until I see him again...or get my own copy.

A push-your-luck mashup of a Bingo and a wargame. It has a devoted following among old school Avalon Hill-ers, and had I played it back in the day when I was playing Acquire, maybe I’d have a soft spot for it. I came to the game in 2010 when the design felt badly outdated and unnecessary. 

But after a few plays I’m seeing the charm of it. You set yourself up for an offensive against somebody, hope for the right chit pulls for turn order, and then roll some dice. A reasonably good offering for 5-6P.

far too much randomness for my current tastes (11/11) and the ever increasing number of chits in the cup make the game seem to drag as luck comes home to roost...strategy died along with my interest as 3 of 5 players were passivly watching the other 2 get endless draws while we starved.

I like this game more with every play, but there is always something we miss or forget due to the classic AH ruleset.  They're not as bad as the norm, so I am partially to blame for this; but some are open to interpretation.

UPDATE 14AUG08:  After a couple more plays I find more and more people feel disgruntled by the chance aspect; not so much because there is one, more because it makes this the kind of game you need to find your way around before you can ascertain the risk of each investment.  I have lowered the rating to a 7, but only because after some thought an 8 does not belong.

This game is a kick -- lots of raw amusement value.

It's also fun to strategize and figure out the "terrain". For example, controlling the Dallas-Fort Worth hub gives you an exceptionally high return on your investment and is a great place to spend your early money -- but only if you're strapped for cash. If you have a lot of money, there are better things to do with it.

One downside is the strong random element. One time I had what really felt like a secure holding... and then an opponent declared fare war and just mowed me down. I consulted a probability chart I'd made and saw that the chances of such a decimation were about 20 to 1 against. But it's not uncommon to have 20 fare wars in a single game, so I guess that's how the cookie crumbles. Huh.

Since this is basically a war game, it has little to no appeal for my non-gamer friends.

Can you say "Frustration" when your hubs' chips aren't pulled so you make no money due to no fault of your own?  I know you can.  Even that wouldn't be so bad considering some of the good things about the game if it didn't just take sooo long to complete this thing.

I wish someone would issue a streamlined update of Air Baron.  There's some great stuff here, but the game's too repetitive, too random, and a little awkward in parts.  It's either too luck-based for a game of its length or too long for a game with this amount of luck.

This is a fun game. But there is sooooo much randomness that two players could (and typically do) have identical strategies...one player is highly successful whereas the other is completely unsuccessful. Thus, the game plays out to its conclusion despite the strategy you employ, not because of it.

Power Grid with airports.  The play and feel of Air Baron is very similar to Power Grid except for the unfortunate random selection of income and turn order.  This randomness can completely destroy your chances, despite superior play.

RATING: 7
Totally respect what this game is.  Some parts of Monopoly, some part of Risk . . . but the combo is better than either of those - particularly when you throw in some vintage Avalon Hill goodness.  There are clearly strategies to run in the game.  The random elements have to be managed.  Clearly the wrong combination of things can just be punishing, so not a game that I need to own.  Glad I was able to give it a go.

RATING: 6
My first and only play of this lasted nearly 4 hours. The other players, for whom the game is a long-time favorite, assured me that this was a fluke, but knowing that the possibility is there makes me wary of playing again. Still, I enjoyed the game -- lots of old-school charm, direct confrontation, and a heavy push-your-luck element.

Finally had a chance to play this after wanting to for a very long time.  I even had my own copy at one time but never played it and ended up trading it away.

An interesting concept and neat board, but... There&#039;s luck, and there&#039;s luck. If you don&#039;t get it early, pack it in. Nope, none of your cities. Nope, not this time either. Nope, again. OK, with my 20 bucks I will increase my lead and continue to outdraw you. Oh, the excitement. Oh, the strategy. ;b  Too much down time, although this depends on the players to a degree.

Enjoyable economic game of airline operations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A blast to play but very luck-driven.  The last several games of this I've played have involved one player getting a lucky income boost early, then sweeping the board with a fortunate series of die rolls.  Fun indeed, especially when that player's me, but anticlimactic.

If income were determined in some balanced and consistent manner, the fare wars randomness would approach an appropriate level.

I'd love to see a better economic game with an airline theme - it might be possible to adapt the 18XX system to handle it, for example.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Best played with the maximum number of players.  Lots of luck makes every game different, so even poorer players have a chance.

Although I prefer the basic game, the optional disaster rules add just a little bit more for the die-hard fan.

The only thing that keeps this game from getting a higher rating is its length, which can clock in at three hours or more with a full compliment of players.

     I like the speed of this and the ebb and flow of the different air-lines over the course of the game.  Has some luck issues and can sometimes go on too long, but most plays are a lot of fun.  I wish I could replay the map changes in quick-time at the end, just to see the flow of the map again.

RATING: 6
This game has a lot of luck, kingmaking can play an awful big part in deciding the game but still I see the potential for it to be great with the right group. My group wasn't right as one player was heavy into revenge as a guiding motive sucking the fun out of it. All in all this game can be anything between extremely annoying (2/10) and very good (8/10).

A great gem of a game and one Avalon Hill's last but good ones before going under.

I highly recommend.

Although this game has something that I usually consider a fatal flaw -- namely, a high degree of randomness in a relatively long game -- I enjoyed it.

I usually pitch this as "Monopoly, but good" or "Monopoly with an ending".  It usually holds to that, but a series of defender-heavy dice rolls can occasionally just drag a game to a ponderous halt.

Also, I recommend using most of the edge case rules (Jumbos, SSTs, etc) as optional rules; the game works just fine stripped down to basic airport purchasing and takeovers. Loans, however, need to be kept in. They're critical to mitigating lopsided chit draws early.

Some eurogamers I've played with complain that this game has too much luck.  But I really like that aspect of it.  Its a game of managing and manipulating luck.  Sure, each profit draw is random, but you know the odds exactly, as its your moves that determined what profit counters are in the cup in the first place.  I've seen lots of different strategies win.  And I've seen great games where someone came within a dollar of being able to afford to take over the last airport in fare wars in order to get the market share to win, only to get bankrupted by an oil fare hike on the next draw.  This game makes for great stories.

It shows some American wargame company roots, but not as much as you might think. The special events of the advanced game are very fun, but I discard the Fuel Hike tokens, which draw out the game too long.

Pulling chits out of a cup = luck, rolling dice = luck, waiting for your turn just so you can earn more chances at getting lucky = boring.  This game at it's essence is like picking lotto numbers and then hoping that your power ball pops out of the machine...

Came out the same year as El Grande and seems like a last-gasp effort by AH to produce a playable game by adopting a few euroy mechanics (variable turn order, limiting player options to keep turns short, etc). But it still feels like an old-school AH wargame with its die-rolls, modifiers for controlling adjacent hubs, and devastating event chits.

10/27/97 Received. Obvious it was targeted towards AH's core audience; wargamers. The rules use wargame terms (e.g. attack, defend) when explaining how to increase your airline's share of a hub. Not that the wording of the rules keeps it from being a good game though. I just found it very odd in what is supposed to be a business/economic game.

I'm an aviation nut, so of course I had to get this one.  It's a pretty fun game and has a pretty good mechanic for income generation.  With the addition of taking airports, it sometimes has the feel of a war game.  The only problem is if you don't have an income draw for a while.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.75
Really nice economic game with a splash of conflict - not too dicey or capricious.  In our most recent play, 5 experienced gamers continually ganged up on the leader to create what seemed like to be perpetual parity.  We did not consider the value of income and using cash on hand to supplement our market share.  This also effected our build strategy and game actions, so the game went on too long and we called it after 3.5 hours.

RATING: 9
Love this game.  The replay value is very high because of the multiple variables built into the game system - dice, chit draws, calamities, and variable turn order.  There are "strategies" to be followed, but any of these variables can totally s**t on you, which forces you to play a more nuanced game than would otherwise be the case.  Some folks might think it's too random, but for my money, if there wasn't the equalizing mechanic imposed by the variables, it would be little more interesting than Monopoly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like this game. Now this is obvious from my rating but why? It's probably the random drawing of the chits that does it for me. I guess I like nicely designed random mechanisms in game. But more importantly I like the fact that you get to build something. You get to expand your company and in the end put all the others out of business!!
Plus, the satisfaction of getting the monopoly in a big area like New York or Chicago is increadible!

Fun game that seems to get a bad rap in my gaming group.  Yes, there are a few random events that can really hurt, but that's part of the game.  I don't mind having to make choices to protect against large negative outcomes.  It seems that others are uncomfortable with assessing an expected impact (i.e. risk of event occuring x effect of risk).  Like I said, it's part of the game.

The luck of the draw is very high in this game. You can be in alot of trouble depending on how the turn order is pulled. Also, if you extend yourself too far, the oil price hike event can destroy you. The way you battle seems a bit unfair, if you win you can continue battling, but if you lose you can't try again. Lucky die rolls can strongly alter the board, despite a player's strategy.

This game feels a lot like Power Grid to me, but more luck-based.  I don't really like that you only get paid when the chits are randomly drawn from the cup.  And I don't like that someone can just crush everyone else in the game through no special skill of their own.  A first-time player has as much chance of winning as anyone, and that bugs me a little in what feels like it should be a skill-based game.

This is the game that started me into the real world of boardgaming, hence I'll never remove it from the top spot on my top ten.

It's a very fun game that I consider a hybrid of a war game and euro-econ game.  The point of the game is to attain market share (e-e) but along the way you find yourself in takeover battles with your opponents, hinging on die rolls and accompanied by modifiers (wargame).

I'll concede that there is a good amount of luck in this game, but there are also ways to circumvent bad luck which I've included in my strategy guide.

This is a great blend of war and economic game. I think the theme is well worked here. This should be good for getting family and friends to play.

There are a number of really wonderful ideas here.  I really wanted to love this game and perhaps if this were ever updated I'd be excited to check it out, but for everything that is good about it, there is just an obscene amount of luck.

If your chits get pulled you have the chance to do well, if they don't, well there isn't much you can do.  If you don't have cash you can't buy anything, or you have to buy cheap, which means that you are polluting the chit pull to a lower chance of better income, in addition the worse you do, the less defense you have against hostile take overs.  When people have luckily earned money for the takeover, there isn't anything you can do to defend what you paid for.  Once someone has more territory, they will they will have more chits to be pulled, they will earn more on the chit pulls, and they will have more offensive and defensive power.  

This game has a clear runaway leader problem that just eliminates any fun to be had.  Which is a shame as there is really a lot to love here.

I'd be very interested in trying variants to update this game.

I like this one a lot.  At first you think it's going to be a marathon experience a la Rail Baron, but board position can change lightning quick, and games don't drag at all.

1 play, long ago. I think it was a pretty fun economic/network-building/area control game. But Mary didn't like it much at all -- too wargamey -- so it sat on the shelf for years before finally being sold off.

Played a handful of times several years ago and didn&#039;t really enjoy it.  Plays out ok as I remember, but I definitely have no interest in playing again.  Far too may better games out there, such as Rail Baron...

Great game. Unfortunately, games in my group have deteriorated into "waiting games", where nobody is risking fare wars anymore and everybody is racing to buy jumbos as soon as possible. When everybody is trying the same (apparently best) strategy, the game gets a little boring.

This is a war game hidden in an economic game.  The random elements ..... die rolling for gate take overs and the pull of profits from the cup will put off some players.  The possibility of a player being eliminated does show the age of the game design but a multi player war game always has that result as a possibility. In all is was an enjoyable time spent with lots of the suspense built up in surprise elements.  This one is a game I would play again

An older AH economic wargame hybrid that rewards aggressive play. Probably not for those sensitive to "rich get richer", unlucky tile draw, or elongated game duration issues.

Very fun game.  The theme works well, and it's structured so that conflict with other players must occur in order to win--no sitting back and waiting for the money to roll in.  It can be a little on the long side sometimes though.

RATING: 9.5
A very good game for 4-5 that balances steady economic growth versus risky expansion and "fare wars" to clip your competitors' wings.  Some players may find this game too chaotic, but you actually have a lot of tools (loans, jumbos, foreigns, fare wars, etc.) to help you manage the luck of the chit pulls.  Use the tools, Luke!

Avoid the basic rules.  We play a minor house rule -- strikes never last more than one turn -- to decrease player frustration (you can occasionally get trapped in strike hell when you have loans outstanding).

RATING: 9
A great economic "war game" which is easy to learn and fun to play. Only reason it gets a 9 and not a 10 is because in rare instances a player can be hit hard economically early and be marginalized in game play.

Choice quote from comment to an article on thew topic:

"I feel this article gets it about 90% right, but just like everything else I have ever read on this topic in the business press or general news type publications the author chooses to perpetuate the myth that there is a big difference between regional airlines and the legacy airlines that employ/exploit them.

Regional airlines are fake airlines. They are shell companies that only exist as the playthings of Legacy airlines. Their sole purpose is to increase the profitability of the legacy carriers by arbitraging labor, sowing discord among professional pilot ranks and encouraging ‘race to the bottom’ labor market dynamics. The sides of the aircraft are painted with the logos for Delta, United and American. The tickets held by the passengers in regional jet cabins are sold by Delta, United and American, and in many cases the aircraft themselves and various other ‘regional’ company resources belong to the parent/master legacy company. The regional sector hasn’t grown, but rather the legacies have successfully maximized profits by expunging thousands of professional pilots from their seniority lists while still getting them to fly their aircraft and passengers for cheap. if the legacies in-house their struggling shell company regionals and give the hopeless regional pilots a seniority number with a decent wage, work rules, and benefits this so-called ‘crisis’ will be over. It’s only a crisis if you are an airline CEO addicted to cheap, exploited labor."

I like the way the fare wars are balanced out by the random drawing of the turn order, but it's too random for me.  The game was too dry, with too much chance of a runaway win if one player manages to snowball his way through a fare war with, say a  5 advantage.  'Course, if other players had worked that area, too, it wouldn't have given him that much advantage....

a fantastic game of building airline networks. There is plenty of player interaction and conflict, and little downtime between turns. At one point, it was the most requested game I own. Does show its age compared to more balanced and streamlined Euros, but among my favorite Avalon Hill titles for 4+ players.

Too bad that Air Baron uses such an antiquated gameplay of chits drawing (reminiscent of Merchant of Venus) to determine player order as well as cash flow.  The complete randomness is fun at first, but gets exponentially frustrating as others get richer through no effort besides that they are lucky.  It seems like Murphy's Law is at full force because it is almost always the case that your tokens get drawn when you're in a fares war, but when you're not they are nowhere to be seen.

There is no catch up mechanism.  There are no other ways to make money.  It is entirely possible to be eliminated simply because you have no income and no airports to control.  Although the downtime is fairly low, but the game could go on forever if no one is aggressive enough.  There is also no method to remedy the fact that chits are added constantly but you still draw the same number each turn.

Even though I really like the area majority aspect of each hub as well as how modifiers are added under various circumstances.  The aforementioned problems are just too glaring to gloss over.  Definitely could use an update.  Air Baron is certainly playable as it is, but not very enjoyable I'm afraid.

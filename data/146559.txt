I'm usually not a fan of auction games, and Infamy is no exception; but the mechanics of auctioning in this game are admittedly very well done, and it is the auctions that make the game.

Infamy doesn't take too long to play (once you know what you're doing); but it is far too fiddly and has a runaway-leader problem. Additionally, I have to question some of the terminology choices which were made: it would have made a lot more sense to simply call the two phases of each "Turn" "Day" and "Night", rather than ALSO calling them "Rounds". That can lead to some crucial rules misunderstandings!

Very well themed, though.

Chris Farrell makes an interesting comparison between Infamy and Lords of Waterdeep in his comments.  At heart both games are euros that conceal their identity beneath an ameritrashy gloss.  Both add levels of screwage not commonly seen in euros. Infamy gives us crime syndicates on Mars indulging in sabotage, theft and action denial.  This is kept at a tolerable level for my taste, but will upset those who prefer their games multi-player solitaire.

Central to Infamy is an auction of contacts - characters who bring special abilities or resources.  Infamy's auctions do several interesting things.  The first is that every time you make a bid or increase one you have to pay a fee.  That encourages players to bid what they think the contact is worth straight away, rather than upping their bid in increments.  The second is that you can enter or re-enter the bidding after passing.  Hence, early in an auction players may wait for someone else to show their hand. This works rather well with the pay to bid mechanic.  Finally, everyone has a set of bidding chips that must last two turns.  Overbidding in the first turn can leave you financially embarrassed when that essential contact turns up in the second. 

To its auctions, Infamy adds a little worker placement and some recipe completion (aka missions).  Turns are quick and there is the auction game virtue of little downtime.  It gives you plenty to think about.

In terms of strategic options, Infamy feels a little weak.  There are two kinds of victory point, infamy and reputation.  Your strategic decision is to focus on one or the other.  You will need to make that decision early and stick with it, for better or worse.  

Production quality is very good. The artwork is suitably dark and Cyberpunky.

RATING: 5.5
After one play... this is a mission-completion game that is similar to Lords of Waterdeep or Yedo, but with an added "bidding" layer for about half of the actions each round.

The "pay to play" auction adds some interesting decisions, making it potentially more worthwhile to place a large bid. 

Both the auctions and worker-placement part can easily cause a player to do nothing meaningful on their turn (auction by spending too much or too little, worker-placement because players choose a SECTOR with only 3 spaces, one of which is very often useless or off-limits). Because of this the game feels extremely resource and action poor (some call it "tight") and to me, this is unpleasant.

I wasn't too happy with my first play but my vision is blurred by having actually COMPLETELY lost the game thanks to a misplay (you must have at least one bribe token remaining in order to use a "favor" token... how could I forget?)

Killer game, just dripping with theme, you're a criminal attempting to make a name for yourself among three factions on a heavily populated Martian mining city/colony. Bribe contacts, complete missions and schemes, with intuitive resource mechanics and great 'abilities' you accrue as you gain rep with each of the factions. Enjoy the design, the artwork, the whole thing really.

God, this game is tense. Worker placement plus auctioning means a lot of interaction between the players, which is always a favorite of mine. 

This game has all the criteria of a game I want in my collection. It's

-Approachable (easy to teach, even to lighter gamers)
-Complex, not fiddly (Lots of important decisions, little maintenance)
-Reasonably paced (60-90 minutes is fine)
-Beautifully produced (Even the rulebook is written well!)

I can't think of a reason NOT to own this game. It's a great mash-up of several great mechanics in a well-executed, thematic package.

I enjoyed the game, but it lasted way too long. I mostly enjoyed the upgrade paths, but I think while it is balanced, because it is stagnant, it will also maybe get repetitive and lack replayability. I also didn't find the cards very helpful and mostly distracting from an otherwise solid workerplacement/bidding game. A built-in game timer may fix my main complaint with the game though, which is it just went on too long.

RATING: 8
OK, a few general comments on this one, which I continue to like. For me there is a definitely Waterdeep vibe to it: you gather resources, complete missions, try to find mission and special power synergies. Combine it with a tactical and bidding game for resources and a small worker-placement-ish element, and there are a fair number of interesting moving parts. To me, it's more interestingly thematic than Waterdeep, since the missions have more range and because as a game it's more chaotic; you're definitely looking for ways through a rapidly changing environment and ways to cut down on your risk. That feels truer to the "Mars crime syndicate" than the somewhat bloodless Waterdeep does for a similar setting.

But, just because I like it for a lot of the same reasons I like Waterdeep doesn't mean that reasoning will work for most people. I think the appeal of Waterdeep for a lot of people is that there *isn't* much risk in the game; it's a fairly  bloodless Euro (which is totally fine; I like Waterdeep). Infamy has an edge to it that may specifically turn off Waterdeep fans even though the games are broadly similar in a lot of ways. Infamy is also thematically darker. The two games are of the same order in how much they let you hose other players (Waterdeep has a fair number of moderately nasty Intrigue cards, and Infamy has nothing as nasty as Waterdeeps mandatory quests; still, on balance, Infamy consistently offers a bunch of ways for players to interact and inconvenience or trump each other). But because Infamy clearly *looks* more cutthroat because that's the setting, and has fewer "friendly" intrigue cards and quests, plus it has the directly head-to-head bidding process where the stakes can be fairly high, I think it may turn off Waterdeep fans who like the more predictable and less sharp environment.

Infamy is short. It's rated at an hour, which you can probably do with experience, although 90 minutes is more likely first time. I think that's fine, but it's one of the rare games that I think could actually stand to go just a little bit longer - an extra couple turns maybe. It might let the game breathe a little more; as it is, completing just a few missions will be enough to win. But allowing it to run longer would require many tweaks to the system, as it is it ends pretty much at the right time, which is to say once one person is clearly winning and before the players who clearly don't have a chance can get too bored.

Last comment, as an early game from a new publisher, there are a couple presentation SNAFUs. Much of the game is actually quite nice, but the mission cards have small text, white on black, this is both important, hard to read, and not easily accessible to all players by virtue of location. There are some tags which are even worse, really small fonts with even lower contrast. It's not awful, I've seen worse (I actually think Imperial Settlers is much worse), but it should be better and it detracts from the game somewhat. Secondly, the terminology isn't great. Given how well-developed the setting is in so many ways, I would have preferred using clear terms like "start player" instead of "triggerman" (which is also gendered and so not the best choice on those grounds alone). "Mission" and "Scheme" are also confusing. It's not terrible, but it doesn't help make the game accessible.

Anyway, I rather like Infamy, for the reasons that are contained above. But I think for fans of euros and Waterdeep, it may be a bit more niche than I initially would have guessed, just going on my own sense of taste.
---
I liked this - it has a bit of a Waterdeep vibe actually, with lots of missions you need requiring a variety of resources that have various payoffs. The core mechanic here though is an auction, for various roles that give you resources and temporary tactical powers. It does have just a touch of that Kickstarter vibe, it feels a little unpolished mechanically - some elements feel superfluous while some of the good stuff isn't quite allowed to breathe like it should - but on balance it's still pretty solid I thought and I ended up ordering a copy for myself.

I've now played about ten bouts of this game. The artwork is fitting and very nice. The theme hits me and I like it. I like many things in this game but I have this nagging feeling that it is flawed. And the flaw, in my opinion, is in the balance.

Out of the ten games I've played none have seen a player reach higher than rank 3 in the tech-corp and never has anyone reached beyond rank 2 in the militia. Every game we play the winner is a player who went for the Harada cartel or general infamy rep supported by cartel ranks. Last three or so games I've purposefully tried to avoid completing cartel missions. Still I've ended up with high rank in the cartel. Why? I can't pinpoint it, I haven't counted the mission cards. But I have the feeling that there are more of them than the other factions' missions or that they offer seemingly better rewards. Or that the cartel ranks allow you to steal from other players so it hampers players who have gone for the other factions and slows their progress.

Win a few games the same way in a row, big deal. Win ten games the same way in a row, something is wrong in the balance of the game.

I enjoyed the first couple of times. After a few more plays I enjoy it even more!

I really like how turns go by quickly and you are constantly involved so the down time is pretty low.

The game is very thematic which is a great plus for me.

Once everyone knows how to play the game gets even better and more tight.

The scheme cards are not as damaging as you would expect which is good since I would have hate it if they were any stronger. They are pretty good on the right situation.

Can't wait to play more!

RATING: 8
Cyberpunk theme that combines an interesting bidding element with action selection and multiple paths to victory.

Using a fixed number of bribes as currency, one of which you must spend just to bid, is an interesting approach. The ability to re-enter a bid after you've passed presents an interesting dynamic. Some people seem to really dislike that mechanic, but I found it added some solid tension to the game. Combined with the day/night element, you really had to strategize about how to spend those bribes. I feel like we didn't dig into the faction cards as much as we should have due to inexperience, so I want to explore those some more.

If anything, I would prefer a little more variability with the contacts and perhaps one or two more sectors, but it's fine as is, and could be easily expanded.

Fantastic game.  While the theme and art are awesome, they lend little to the game itself.  In short, you have a resource-management Euro with a wonderful auctioning system that keeps the game nice and tight.  What's interesting here is the intense need to keep an eye on the other players at the table.  If you're not paying attention, the game is over in a heartbeat.  The key to Infamy is keeping the other guy down while you raise yourself up.

Nagyon jó kis kombós, licitálós játék. Féltem tőle, mert mindenhol nagyon kitolósnak titulálták, de nem éreztem annyira vészesnek a dolgot. Kétségtelenül keresztbe lehet, sőt kell is tenni az ellenfeleknek, de nincs kifejezetten direkt konfrontáció. 
Iszonyat sok helyre kell (kéne) figyelni. Az első játék így inkább csak ismerkedés volt. Nehéz lekövetni a sok egymással kombózó képességet, pláne még tervezni is rá.
A játékidő teljesen tolerálható 90 perc volt. Mindenképp megtartós, remélem találok hozzá társaságot is. :)

Judging by the number of copies I have seen of this around on fire sale, this one was forgotten before its time had passed. One of the best impromptu pick-ups I have made. Love the pay-to-play bidding mechanic. Theme is properly immersive and ever-present; the art is gritty and appealing. The "take that" is not as friendship-breaking as others would lead you to believe (if you are leading, you are going to be targeted, nothing shocking). I found the climax to be quite satisfying; one bidding misstep or lapse in attention span (invites amazing table talk) can cost you a close game.

Has a rare half-point penalty from me because they could not figure out anything to fix the restrictive player count, but it certainly left me wanting more.

Bidding game with minor bits of worker placement. I almost feel like they should've skipped the board and just put the M/Resource/HQ stuff on the cards themselves.

Tried this because of how much I enjoyed Heroes Wanted. Like HW, this game is a lighter Euro dripping with theme. However, this game does have some flaws among a few interesting mechanisms at work. First, the auctions are dumb. There's no reason to not bid high all at once, so they play kind of on autopilot. Also, it's very easy to be sitting on a bunch of resources you can't do anything with. The different ways of winning are cool, although it seems like infamous victories are much harder to pull off. I enjoyed the game, for the most part, but I feel like Yedo and Lords of Waterdeep do similar things in better ways.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A masterpiece of elegant rules minimalism. The game has a lot of things to think about, and involves looking back and forth across the table, so it is not suitable for AP-prone players. However, the mechanics of the light auction are superior in thematic sense and fun to most other board games. The euro-mechanics are deftly hidden underneath a healthy dosage of backstabbery, interaction and an all around human affair. It's an auction without feeling like an auction game, a eurogame without feeling like a eurogame. The components can survive a splash of coca-cola (tested), with a thick durable material and wonderful clean aesthetics. Right up the same alley as Study in Emerald and Biblios/Ninjato, somewhere between the two extremes in lightness, but a lot more nasty. The game has a certain sexiness (think Android universe) that makes it fun to look at on the table. 

NOTE: A common rules mistake, even among youtube reviewers, has players choosing either inf or rep off mission cards, whereas the correct interpretation is to claim BOTH. This error completely changes the game and slightly towards the broken/boring. Do not fall into this trap!

This game has a little bit of a run away leader problem, but for me it did not distract from the game, and it was not notacable. The best part of the game is the bidding,every time you bid or re bid you lose one unit of money weather or not you win. This makes for a lot more thoughful approches to biding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A deep auction game. Really tough to know the value of things and what to bid, since half the auction isn't available until the next round. Thus it can be very punishing, but at the same time allows players to punish the leader and keep them in. A good game and one that I'd gladly play again.

Really, really enjoy this game. You can try to get to 15 Infamy, or vie to get to level 5 on one of the factions. Each level also giving you enhanced abilities. Henchmen, in either case, are very powerful.

There is virtually zero down time, as players need to be constantly engaged.

I also think you need to play dirty to win this. Always be on the lookout for ways to stick it to the other players. 

For me, that's a good aspect of the game.

RATING: 4
Game handicaps itself with a turgid pace brought on by quick and easy introductions of hazards and whatever the piece is that blocks a whole city. Between that and Sabotage effects, it's not uncommon to see only one mission completed each turn, while everybody else sits on unwanted piles of drugs and computer chips. Bidding is ham-fisted, allowing previous passers to enter bidding again. Not only does this increase time to play for little to no benefit, but it allows players to just sit on their hands and wait for someone else to do something, an extremely undesirable (in my opinion) feature to have in a game. Game would be decent if it just didn't actively make every attempt to take longer than it needs to.

Infamy your typical auction-for-role-selection, recipe-fulfillment game set in a dystopian future on Mars. Well, maybe there aren’t many games that fit that bill after all. Infamy is quite a nice package, with quality components and art, and mostly solid graphic design. There are two victory conditions: earning 12 infamy points, or getting to five reputation in any one of the three factions of the game. Each round is divided into day and night, which are basically the same thing. Players spend a limited pool of resources to bid on roles that grant special powers and determine turn order. Then the players send workers onto the board to take actions, potentially completing quests or gaining resources or cards that grant special rule-breaking powers. The night phase happens in the same way except that players have now spent some of their bidding resources and must make do with what remains. At the end of the night, those resources refresh, and everything resets for another round. 

There are some interesting things going here. I typically dislike straight recipe-fulfillment, but the bidding for roles and multiple paths to victory elevates Infamy slightly above the standards of the genre. I’m happy to play again, but won’t seek this out.

There's a lot going on in this game and the fact that it has this sci-fi theme makes this one a good one.  I definitely like the bidding mechanics in this game, but I feel that the worker placement part of it is a little weak.

I like the bidding mechanism, but the act of actually keeping track of the the bids as they progress is too fiddly.

Good game. Theme of the game is not something I am totally crazy about but the underlying mechanics make it enjoyable. The game has enough complexity to make it enjoyable if you want some strategy, but it's not so complex that you will fry your brain trying to absorb too many details.

I thought this game is a lot of fun, easy to teach and learn. Great pick for a semi-casual board game night at the local shop.

I enjoyed this despite it being a theme that doesn't really appeal to me. Clever bidding mechanic - reasonably simple and straightforward gameplay with interesting strategies to pursue. Once you know what you're doing it should play reasonably quickly although my first game unaccountably took more than 2 hours! Good game, and if the theme appeals then this would verge on "must have".

I can't say quite why I wasn't taken into this game. It just didn't seem that interesting. I'll update more if I play it again or if more  regarding the 'meh' factor comes to mind. I'd be up for giving it a second chance, but I wouldn't seek it out. 
During the one play so far, the ending was very anticlimactic. During the last turn, it was obvious who was going to win. There was nothing that could be done to stop him at that point. I guess if we were more familiar with the game we could have done something different in  a previous round, but I don't really care much to figure that out. It wasn't just the ending, I was pretty bored through most of it, even when I was in the lead for most of the second half of the game. Moving on...

I've only had the opportunity to play this once since receiving my copy and it's quite a bit of fun. I am not sure that this is a game that you should play with folks who are easily angered because of the amount of back stabbery that goes on, but it's an easy game to learn and with the right people, it's fast and fun.

I am hoping to get more plays in very soon!

The art and theme looks fun.  I like the cyberpunk world - I feel like the Android universe would more or less tie right into this.

An auction game with one of the absolute best auction mechanisms I've ever seen.  I don't know if it's good enough to carry an entire game, but we will see with more plays.

A thematic euro-style game. Real nice mix of themes with matching mechanics. Multiple paths to victory but no one-way track. Instead it's an adaptive/reactive game play.

What seems like a vital design at first, reveal defeciencies in the different roads to victory. 

I would steer away from this title, which is a damn shame on those cool bits and theme.

I've been pretty unimpressed with Mercury Games to this point, mostly based on my experiences with Quarantine which felt under developed from a good initial idea, but I'm pleased to say that I didn't get that half-baked feeling from Infamy.

It looks like a Kickstarter game, but plays like a published game which is half-way to high praise indeed.

My only slight quibble is that the contracts seemed relatively unimportant, but perhaps that's because in our three player game, we all made a point of blocking the mission locations and sabotaging any mission that could be done, so only three were completed all game.

It's not perfect and the theme is as non-existent as in many other resource collection games (which isn't really a criticism, more an observation) but I enjoyed Infamy.

Love the cyberpunk setting and aesthetic. Great thematic bribery (bidding) mechanics. A poor rulebook by today's standards though.
The dual points system is fantastic in not making either option feel like abstract 'points', but your rise in repuation or infamy.

A bidding Euro skinned in Ameritrash cyberpunk.  Everything is just ok in this game with nothing really remarkable jumping out.  Players are rewarded for winning so group griefing on the lead player is necessary for any possibility of catch-up.  There are avenues to influence board control on an individual basis but to win players just need to successfully bid, increase resources, and grab missions focused to increase the abilities on the player board, which simultaneously drives toward the win condition.  Will play without complaining if placed on the table but would never seek it out.

A game about being an absolute bastard to all of your friends and screwing up their plans at every opportunity. Awesome!
I really like the bidding mechanism in this game, which punishes timid bidders by having them slowly bleed cash through having to pay expenses every time they up their bid.
Games are always very tense and you have to watch what everybody is doing so you can block them from doing it. 
Not a game I'm always in the mood for, but still a really good, nasty, hardcore brain-burner.

Opinion after 2 games played: I like this one very much. The rules are simple, but the strategy itself requires a lot of thinking. The game can be intanse as you try to balanse getting the stuff you need against getting in the way of other players. With the time required to play it (1-1,5 hour) it hits a great spot in my collection - a challanging, strategic game that you can put on the table more easily than other heavy games. I would give it a 9, but component quality it's, well, just ok, with some mistakes and not lined up counters. Stil, highly recommended!

7 after 1 play.

Most of the game's mechanics mesh well with its theme, with perhaps the exception of the missions, which feels like a resource for points exercise. There is a few things to remember once you get a few promotions, but this should ease with a few more plays. 

Player interaction is reasonably high. Components quality is also quite good.

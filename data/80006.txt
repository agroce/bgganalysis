Notable mostly for its unique mechanics (listening for dropping cubes). The gameplay is not terribly engaging, but it is a memorable experience because of its oddness. This is the sort of game which makes me glad Zoch Verlag exist - I'm glad there is an avenue for publication of such weird games.

A fun little filler game about finding the murderers in a 3D hotel, listening as best you can to detect how far the cubes fall, it's rarely what you think either. A nice game, wouldn't turn it down and would probably suggest it.

A clever game, seemingly based on [b]Wallenstein[/b]'s cube tower.  If you've ever wondered just where the cubes were in that tower, you now understand most of this game.  Good playing time, odd box.

Unlike anything I else remember playing.
Game play revolves around listening to cubes falling down a tower to work out which level they are on and trying to find the other players cubes.
The tower isn't as well constructed as would be good however.

Weird idea as a central mechanic, but a solid entrancing experience. Dropping cubes into a cardboard pyramid-tower filled with sneaky little shelves that test your inner Daredevil (marvel) capabilities is surprisingly fun. And the conceit of the game revolving around a crime scene that you manipulate in your favour is pretty cool and oddly reminiscent of Android (which is the long and mind-numbingly complicated way of doing it).

A guessing and memory game.  The better your hearing, the better your chances of doing well since you're guessing which level the cube(s) fell to in the tower based on the sound they make.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Novel, I give it that - and it gets an extra point for it. But I wonder quite how much "deduction" is actually in the game, it feels very chaotic and luck dependant.

Players drop cubes into a tower of boxes, hoping to determine on which floor the cube lands. Then you guess which floor has a particular result, then reveal and score that floor.

Problem is of course you have no idea of the colour of the cubes actually falling, so in the end it is all guesswork.

Theme is paper thin, this is really just an abstract game.

Overall, quite liked it at first - got a bit bored as it went on (and on and on) ... would play it if asked, no desire to own it.

A unique game in more than one way. The nested boxes containing the game pieces are inverted and stacked to create a tower representing the eponymous Arosa hotel. Player cubes and murder cubes are trickled in through the top and fall unseen through holes inside the tower to land on various floors... but which ones? Players then guess Cluedo style as to which floors contain the dreaded murder cubes. Correct guesses earn you points but if you have the most player cubes are on that floor then you did the deed an loose points (you naughty homicidal maniac you!). A really fun party game that will have to pressing your ear against the play-tower listening for trickling cubes like a safecracker.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fantastic game that's really unique.  You're dropping cubes into the tower and listening in order to try and frame the other players of murder.  Great filler, though you need a semi-quiet place to play.

It is always good to have games that my kids are better at than me. This is one of them. It is simple, yet still has a little strategy to it. The kids enjoy ganging up on me, which is a weakness of the game (it is easy to single out one player and make them lose), but I don't care - at least it gets them to play a game.

RATING: 6
Cleverly designed game designed around the gimmick of dropping dice into the hotel and trying to hear which floor they landed on.  The whole game is essentially trying to hear which floors other peoples' cubes have landed on, and calling out where the cubes landing, and then revealing the floor to see if you were right.

If you're right, cubes of the players you called out are placed on a clue board, which score points for those players the closer the cubes were found to the floor which contained the crime scenes (determined by the drop of two red cubes at the beginning of the game).  Points are of course bad!

The game was a lot of fun the first time around, but I can see how it's a really fun gimmick for the first few games with probably not much staying power.  Still, a very neat design that will be fun to pull out from time to time.

RATING: 8
Most games ask you to see the changes in game state, this game asks you to hear them. That is an enormous change in how we normally interact with games. Very impressive.

It helps that the art on the tower in incredible, and the idea of tossing cubes into a cool looking tower is very pleasing on an aesthetic level.

The game's biggest flaw is that one of the possible actions in the game is covering your tracks, which can make the game move backwards away from the end of the game when it is successful, and I do prefer my games to always be moving towards the end of the game so that they don't last forever.

Love this! Been meaning to import it every time I see a store carry it. It's basically a mix between a deduction game, a party game and a dexterity game. You drop cubes in the top, and listen for them as they come down the tower. Then you try and guess where other people's cubes are. Very fast, fun and easy. Good for kids or adults alike.

Unique cube tower mechanism that does not behave like a dice tower but still behaves as a randomizer. Not really a deduction game but requires you to listen for the cubes to hit the different levels in the building. A unique filler game but not in print for USA.

Functional and dry components on a colorful but pasted on theme.

Make the fewest errors in guessing based upon sound and hope your opponents do worse. Also a small memory component if you can distinguish which cubes fell where. Fun to guess but more of a guessing game than a strategic game.

Players are guests at the Hotel Arosa, where a couple of murders have been committed.  Players initially have to determine what floor the murders occurred on, and then look as least guilty as possible!  Clever little game where player's cubes are dropped into the hollow hotel "tower", and you have to listen to try and determine where they ended up.  On your turn you announce a floor, and what type of investigation you are performing.  Success means you get to influence the suspect chart - piling guilt on your opponents, or clearing your name.  Failure means you have to toss one of your own cubes into the tower, potentially implicating you.  Clever gimmick, and certainly part party game, but there is some strategy here.  Different, fun, and refreshing.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Memory, listening, partygame.

Dropped cubes in a tower, try to hear where they land. Nominate color(s) and show tower floor to reveal other players cubes. If succesful add their markers to murder suspect chart. Or reveal own cubes to cover up your tracks to remove cubes.

RATING: 5
An audio game that comes down to guessing how far cubes have fallen through a hotel tower by using just your ears (you can't see them).   Very gimmicky and as such it should be fun for a few plays, but after that I don't know.   It's about twice as long as I'd want it to be, however.   The game can also develop a weird bias, since the top two floors are much more obvious than the others.   As such, you can make the game move in reverse by removing your own cubes when you obviously know they are on the top two floors.   A game of this novelty genre needs to move quickly forward, rather than in reverse.  Dozens of cubes will be dropped over the course of the game, one at a time, and it gets quite repetitive quickly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Mord im Arosa confidently straddles the line between innovation and gimmickry. The incredibly unique mechanic of listening for how far down the town each cube falls is refreshingly different, although requires a room of an appropriate volume to support the activity.

However, the amount of game-ness around this concept isn't extremely deep. If you're not able to hear, or a loud noise interrupts the fall, there's not a lot you can do to recover. Problems aside, the concept always manages to garner interest and I can't imagine I'll be removing it from my collection any time soon.

You drop cubes in a cardboard tower and have to listen for where they fall.  It's really cool, and super exciting when you must reveal a level to see if you listened correctly.  However, once you start getting penalty cubes in the tower they never come out, which means that you become an easy target and can get ganged-up on.

Fun game.  The only game I own that comes close is Igloo which is also a hearing game.  Players drop cubes into a tower and through listening, determine which of 8 floors they landed upon. There are 2 murder victims in the tower and points are scored when suspects are identified.

It is listed as a "Memory" game.  I don't enjoy it as a memory game and it doesn't have to be one.  In fact I made a player's aide to help players decide which suspects to call on which floor.  (It's a reusable sheet when laminated and I'll post the file when I get a chance.)  

I think it is a better game when I can make an intelligent guess--and a guess it is because it is hard enough deciding which of the floors a potential "suspect" landed upon. There are still lots of surprises and lots of mistakes.  

I like this game as long as it is not a memory game which I think makes it too chaotic especially with 5, 6 players--which is my preference for the number of players.  If you play with 2 or 3, as a memory game might be better.

Interesting mechanic where you try and listen where cubes have fallen to, although when you try and find the cubes it really just becomes a random guess.

A game like this doesn't come along very often. 

At a certain point most games begin feeling like your father's stories, long in the tooth and way too familiar, except maybe the old man has refined his tale telling abilities since the last outing.  

So then comes, Mord im Arosa.  This is a game that is unlike any other, it is clever, it is fun and the central mechanic is as ingenious as it is simple.  Players drop cubes into a tower and hope to hear and remember where those cubes have fallen.  Then players reveal floors in the hotel as they cast suspicion on others as to who the murderer is.  

Sounds ridiculous, but it works.  And it works well.

Mord im Arosa is easily one of the better games of 2010.

This is a brilliant one of a kind game. Where you have to listen, to where you think the cubes (clues) are being dropped and try to pin the two murders on someone else, all while trying to cover your own tracks. The game is simple to play and doesn't take long to play either. The stackable building is very cool and it's amazing, at just how far those cubes will drop at times.

This would make a really good family party game and is a lot of fun to play. There will surely be a few laughs and groans going around the table, as the clues are exposed. It even plays up to 6 players, which is really nice. I'd highly recommend this unique and fun game.

A "deduction" game where random luck is more important than deduction.

Player drop cubes into a tower of boxes, hoping to determine on which floor the cube lands. Players then guess which floor has a particular result, then reveal and score that floor. 

It is a cute idea, but there really isn't much to it. Players can listen for cubes to drop from floor to floor, but since there is no way to listen for color, the guesses might as well be random.

I have to say, I was 'somewhat' disappointed by it. Not much though.

First of all there really is no 'deduction' part to the game. It really is listening to how far you think cubes fell in the tower and hoping your guesses are correct.

Still quite a bit of fun. The only problem is that the game end trigger is to have all one person's cubes out of their supply or 10 of a person's cube on the scoring board (scoring is actually bad here). So, the problem becomes that you can take cubes off the board and back into your supply. So, in the one game we've played, it easily stalled with people that were getting close to emptying their supply or getting 10 cubes scored, would just get cubes removed from the score board and back into their supply.

So, everyone noticed it was dragging and all basically wanted it to end, but being as we were all gamers we didn't want to lose. Finally, I just made someone score to end the game, even though it meant I couldn't win. If I would have prolonged the game, I might have been able to pull off a win.

It's ridiculous and awesome; certainly the best game I've ever played that tests your hearing. Plus, it's quick and easy to explain and understand. The production values are a little dodgy, though--sometimes the tower's floors don't stack properly.

(12/31/2013) Comment based on one play.

An interesting deduction game that requires dexterity and honed listening skills, but overstays its welcome by 30 minutes.

This isn't really a crime-solving game, where everything seems to be luck-driven. There is a tower, comprised of stacks of cardboard boxes, with each stack representing a floor. There is a small cutout in the middle, which could allow wooden cubes to fall through. Two red cubes are thrown into the tower from the top, and the cubes fall down the various floors, much like the combat tower in Shogun/Wallenstein. The players "listen" and guess what floor(s) the cubes get trapped on.

The second part of the game starts with "seeding" the tower with the various players' cubes. Players then take turns guessing what floor and accusing other player(s). The boxes above the floor are lifted to reveal if there are any cubes. If the accusation is correct, more of the other player(s)' cubes are tossed into the tower, and ones own cube is thrown in if incorrect. A status board shows what players' cubes were discovered on what floors. The proximity to the floor(s) where the red cubes were found determines penalty points. When a player has ten cubes on the status board, the game is over, and the player with the least number of penalty points wins.

This is an intriguing dexterity game, because players must be careful when removing/placing the tower pieces, along with tossing in cubes into the tower. While it is humorous to listen to cubes fall, and delightful when accusations are correct, the game drags on a tad too long for what it is. 15 minutes of this is enough. At 30 to 45 minutes, I am ready for the game to end. Kids and non-gamers may appreciate this, but veteran gamers may not. I initially rate it a "5", but see this plummeting, as I don't see any need (or desire) to play it again. There are many better fillers than this, but it should be played at least once for the novelty.

Gyerekeknek való szórakoztató játék. Teljesen komolytalan parti játék, próbálsz a hallásodra hagyatkozni, de igazából kevésbé tudod befolyásolni a játékot. Ha ezen túl teszed magad, egész szórakoztató tud lenni.

RATING: 6.5
Very cute/neat mechanic of using sound/listening. 

So there is a tower created from nesting boxes, each with a hole in the middle. Colored cubes are dropped in, and--for most of the game--you are guessing any floor and what people's cubes are there. Getting it right nets them "points" (points are bad) per cube that was there, and for each guess you got wrong, you must ADD a cube into the tower. Regardless, all the cubes that were there are [also] dropped back into the tower after looking. The result is that more and more cubes are added; none ever leave.

The game ends once 1 player has 10 found cubes recorded on the sheet. It is possible to remove recorded cubes though (instead of guessing other players, you guess yourself to remove cubes on that floor), so the end game can drag a bit. I think if I ever played again, I would only play to maybe 7? Because 7-8 was about when I was ready for this game to end.

Mord im Arosa is one of those games you might look at and think, "Gimmick!" and hey, you'd be right.  However, that gimmick really does make for a cool looking and fun playing game.  I love how after you listen you could swear that a cube is definitely on the fourth floor only to find out there's absolutely nothing there at all.  Or worse, try to cover your tracks only to reveal 4 or 5 cubes of an opponent on the floor and none of your own.  It's an excellent game that plays fast and has everyone on their toes trying to figure out who killed the victims!

Certainly not bound to win any awards for depth or complexity, but still a crowd pleaser nonetheless. The tower mechanism doesn't seem like it should work, and yet does so fantastically; you would swear that cubes should be on a certain level, only to find that it's completely empty! Made even more fun by shouting "J'accuse!" and "Murderer!" at your targets.

A cute game with a very unique gimmick.  The theme is (as to be expected) extremely thin, not really standing any kind of scrutiny, but who really cares?

I like how you can gang up on the perceived leader, though I could see how others could perceive that as a problem.  There's definitely a ton of luck, and I wish that the game was just a little bit shorter. 

So it's not the kind of thing you could play all the time, but once in a while it's good for a laugh.

I was immediately intrigued by the idea of Mord im Arosa after I first heard about it.  It has been a fun addition to my game library.  Local players have shown enthusiasm for it, and my copy helped sell a few more copies locally.

The novelty factor is high.  Stacking up the tower immediately entices people near by to the game.  Add in the 'listening' element, and you now have a game that plays much differently than most games.

And while I am quite pleased with this game, I will say that I think it completely succeeds as an experience, but only partially succeeds as a game.  There is a tendency for one player to fall into the "fade-away loser" position, and sometimes another player takes on a "run-away leader" position.

The game does allow for players to attempt to improved their position by "covering their tracks", and also, players can try to target the perceived leader by accusing him/her with preference.  But even so, I have noticed I can lose big or win big, and not really feel I have played particularly cleverly.

But still - a tremendously fun event.  The game plays quickly making it a true "filler".

Original mechanic.  Will need to see it it loses its novelty after several plays.
There are some strategies to explore in this game - Do you suspect lots of players every turn?  Uncover floors close to the suspects only?  Look on floors that have been left uncovered? The choice between covering tracks and suspecting others is a good one.

RATING: 5
Very innovative hearing deduction game. Using a player's sense of hearing they attempt to deduce which floors potential criminal activity is taking place. This game is unlike any other I have played before. The majority of the rating comes from this innovation, as the gameplay itself desires more. As clues are always dropped in each turn games can devolve into guessing the last drop. However, that being said, there is a lot here that this game can do for board game design. Interesting nonetheless.

Great silly fun. The tactile nature of this game makes it especially memorable. I strongly recommend playing with only 14 or 16 cubes and ending the game once a player has 7 or 8 clues on the board. This helps prevent it from overstaying its welcome.

This gimmick of a game is just fun...:-)

LIKE:

* Cube tower mechanic is interesting and innovative.  One often thinks that cubes would just fall straight down to the table since it lines up on all 7 pieces of the tower, but this would be far from the truth.  I suppose science would also refute my thought...:-)
* Easy to teach, easy to play AND quick filler!
* So far people had a blast playing the game, listening to the cubes fall to discern who might be where.  People were involved in the game at all times and were cheering and groaning as their cubes were discovered or their suspicions proved incorrect.  

DISLIKE:

* I don't like odd shaped boxes.  This cube is annoying to try and stack with my games!
* This game would not be for people who lack steady hands.  If you tend to shake, I'd avoid this game as you have to pick up the tower at the floor level you suspect people or are trying to hide/remove your clues.

Gioco particolarissimo in cui bisogna avere ORECCHIO.
La tematica racconta di un omicidio avvenuto all'interno del grattacielo dell'Hotel AROSA.
I protagonisti sono persone che si trovavano nell'Hotel al momento dell'omicidio e che devono nascondere gli indizi che li farebbero incolpare mentre cercano indizi a discapito degli altri.
Si gioca buttando fisicamente dei cubetti in una torre bucata su piu piani. Bisogna riuscire a capire e ricordarsi a che piano finiscono gli indizi altrui.
Si è incolpati in funzione di quanti dei propri indizi sono stati trovati in prossimità dei piani in cui sono avvenuti gli omicidi.
Veramente anomalo ed innovativo.
Veloce e divertente da giocare, ma si consiglia di farlo in un luogo silenzioso.

I was joint winner in my single game.  Not entirely sure how.  More gambling than deduction but second half of game focused on getting my pieces off the score 'suspects' board which may of not been the primary goal of my competitors.

An enjoyable and well constructed exercise in manipulating the scoreboard.  A neat balance between accusing and removing evidence in relation to the red cubes.  The scoreboard is really central to the game but the hotel tower will inspire many positive thoughts for gamers, is the seductive part of the game and prevents it from being a very dry exercise.

The more I consider the game I think it is one of the best small games published in the last two years.  It focuses on a simple idea but realised with imaginative flair.  Excellent.  A game not trying to change the world but suceeds in what it is trying to do both in concept and production.  Great credit to the designers.

Played with 2-players. Found it pretty cool. It was refreshing to play a different game from the normal board or card games around. I thought it would be really easy to listen to where the cubes fall but it's never exact and usually a give or take. The cubes also fall onto every floor, and not just group together on a few specific floors, though the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th floors were pretty popular. Also found the game to be a little longer than needed but that can easily be fixed by removing maybe 5 cubes of each color before starting the game. Overall a nice experience, and I think this would be a great party game.

RATING: 7
This is exactly the game I hoped it would be: light, simple, and unique without being dull or simplistic. The aural element is truly unique, and it's surprisingly difficult to tell where cubes land sometimes ("I was SURE that was on 6!").

It takes five minutes or less to teach and about 10 minutes to play with two; it's fun with two. With more I can see how it'd be easier to get "hits" but harder to guess the right colors.

It's a hoot. Nice components, too; the little nesting hotel floors are cleverly made.

It does have what seems to be a bit of a runaway loser problem, though. Once you get a couple more cubes in the tower than anyone else it becomes easier to suspect you, and anything but good guesses worsens the situation. It's a short enough game that this isn't a huge problem, but it does seem to be present.

This game totally surprised me!

At first this game looks and sounds very stupid and boring... but it's awesome fun! Simple and fast. Everyone can understand and play this, even your grandma. (if she can still hear)

Pros:
 - Fast, 10-40 min, great filler game
 - Simple, you can teach and understand this game in just a few minutes
 - Original idea, using your sense of hearing to find the pieces, at least I have not played or found any similar games
 - Lot of fun! As a party game too.

Cons:
 - Maybe too simple for heavy gamers so a few rounds is enough for one game night
 - Using your senses rather than intelligence and deduction skills may be a problem for some, if your hearing is damaged for example.

Players take turns guessing where pieces from the opponents have dropped, using audio cues to help narrow down their options.

Often rewards bashing on one person, although balances out a bit over time because you want to have the fewest cubes on the board to win (while forcing someone else to have the most is simply an end condition).

More of an activity than a game? Probably - but a fun activity and with wonderful table presence. People have very often come over to see what we are doing, or asked to join in, when playing in public.

RATING: 6
The basic idea of dropping cubes in the tower and listening to where they are landing is great but the execution is suboptimal. First of all, the second phase takes way too long. Second, the tower structure, with one clear hole in the middle, is way too simple: It is very common for the cubes to stop at the top floor, and this is very easy to hear as well. The same goes for the bottom floor.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I don't know of any game like Mord im Arosa. Players build a tapering tower out of nested boxes. There is a central hole, through which cubes may be dropped. Each box represents a floor on the Arosa Hotel. Two red cubes stand in for murder victims- they are dropped into the shaft, and players listen carefully, trying to note which floors they stop on. Then more cubes get dropped-in for each player. The idea is to successfully note where your opponents cubes are, so as to point suspicion at them, or to find your own cubes, so you can conceal evidence. Cubes are constantly added and recycled through the lift-shaft, so it gets complicated.

I was worried that cubes would fall down the hole whenever we tried to lift a floor to investigate, but we must all have surgeon hands because it didn't happen once. Much more of an issue was noise- you need a quiet room, otherwise it is very difficult to hear the tipple-topple of tiny clues.

There isn't much strategy - "listen attentively" sums it up. But it is different, and it was fun when people made guesses that were completely wrong.

Absolutely love this fun deduction game! The whole game fits perfectly in a cube of a game box. Clever mechanics and an excellent theme of murder in the Arosa hotel. 

You drop cubes into the tower (which represents the hotel). The cubes land on certain levels of the tower and you must guess where you think they landed. At first you try to find the two murder victims. Then you try to find the guilty parties...this is where it gets interesting. Do you accuse one person or 2 or 3? When you accuse, you will lift the floor of the tower and see whose cubes are there; then they are placed on the score mat. If you accuse and you are wrong, you must add your own cubes to the tower. If your cubes are found then you are found to be more guilty. 

The mechanics of scoring are also quite unique. If you were found on the same floor as the victim, then you will have more points against you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Unique central mechanic to an offbeat and great game! What works so brilliantly in this game is that no one is acting with perfect knowledge of where the cubes are; the game forces you to develop a skill I've never seen utilized in games before...sound! If you want to know the secret to Great Games, it's this: constant engagement! And Mord Im Arosa definitely achieves this with players listening intently to the sound of their opponent's falling cubes and deciding whether to "clear their name" or "accuse" other players, the game keeps everyone's attention! Love it, love it, love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Not much more than a listening exercise co-joined with a hit-the-leader aspect. You can listen and try and determine which floor the cubes have dropped to, and then call out who you reckon is on that floor. If they're there they'll have suspicion points awarded to them (least suspicion points wins). Or don't take the listening too seriously and just pick whoever's winning, pick a floor that'll give them points and hope they're there. Do better by doing both. Each time a floor is revealed, all cubes will be re-thrown in so there's a nice re-set mechanism in place. There's not enough interest or decisions to hold gamers for longer than a game, but it's nice to play with the family tweens as everyone's on a level footing skill-wise and the components provide a nicely different visual.

A nice theme with a simple mechanic. First discover where the two victims are and then accuse others. Simply try and guess where the opponents blocks are within the tower by listening to where they stop when dropped in. Much tougher then it sounds and a lot is luck, but still fun. The only issue is that it can last longer then it should since you can accuse others or clear your cubes which slows down the game but is a necessary part of the rules.

Discovering games like this is one of the best parts of this hobby. Mord im Arosa is such a clever blend of listening and memory with just a touch of dexterity. The main component is a tower of cardboard rectangles representing a hotel. Each box is one floor of the hotel and contains a small hole in the center. Initially, the hotel is seeded with two red cubes and additional cubes in each player's color. In the first part of the game, players are trying to find the red cubes, which are murder victims. A player guesses which floor the victims are on, then lifts up a portion of the tower to reveal that floor. He is rewarded if correct and punished if incorrect. In the second part of the game, players are searching for clues that implicate their opponents in the murder using a similar method. In the end, the player with the least suspicion on her wins the game. 

The tower is a pretty striking visual centerpiece to this unique game. There are only a few games I've experienced that use listening skills, and this does it really well. It's a game that can be taught and played quickly by anyone. It has definitely earned a place on my wishlist.

Silly and fun game where the mechanics seem like they won't work, yet they manage to be very entertaining. Also, one of those games where I have managed to lose by a lot of negative points on every instance. Definitely a family game, but one where the gimmick manages to very engaging.

Clever sound game. You are trying to listed to the cubes getting dropped in a tower and then trying to accuse the other players of the murders found. It was a ton of fun and I am a terrible bluffer. I really enjoyed my play of this. You have to play it in a pretty quite area and not a loud convention. But, I do definitely recommend this. Family would like it too. Adorable!

RATING: 6
Update: once I owned a copy I realised this is like an aural inverse of 7 Gambit/Wits and Wagers whereby you are speculating what colours are where; sadly it becomes repetitive, cloudy and not as entertaining/educational as 7 Gambit.

First play with 5 of the rare "it pays to listen" style of game. Played in 2 phases in which 2 victims are dropped into the lift shaft of an 8 storey hotel, listening to which floor they land. Player cubes follow in and the players, each in turn, try to locate the victims in the hope of removing their own cubes as others are placed on a scoring mat which lists the floors.

Once the victims have been found, the second phase is about either trying to accurately locate and remove your cubes or accusing others onto the scoring mat. At game end, player on or adjacent to the victim(s) floor score 3 or 2 points per cube, any other space is 1pt per cube.

The fun comes from the accuracy of your call and the reveal of what you 'heard' on which floor (a wooden table is a big clue!!).

Has a far better implemented theme than Igloo Pop though not as frantic. First play with 5  and I felt the novelties of listening and cube dropping starts to "overstay their welcome" after about 20 mins. Because of the fun I'd play again with possibly either reducing the number of player or with less cubes in your pool or for endgame condition. It may also reduce the fuzziness of too many cubes on the scoring mat to intuitively feel if you're a strong suspect or innocent.

I'm a sucker for unusual mechanics, and it doesn't get much more unusual than trying to figure out where cubes are by listening to them drop through a 3-D tower. That said, I think I liked the concept more than the game - the scoring elements weren't as interesting as the main premise.

The players cubes are dropped into a tower, by listening you have to "deduce" which cubes are are on which floor. Guess correctly and opponents cubes go to the scoring track, guess wrong and more of your cubes go into the tower. 
Has the good novelty factor of making the dice tower the gameboard, and makes for a decent filler

RATING: 7
Once you get your head around the 'what gets dropped back in the tower' rules, this is an unusual 'listening' game. Listen to the clues (cubes) being dropped into the tower. First search for the two victims then try to find other players clues near the scene. If you guess wrong then you leave more of your clues behind instead (more cubes in the tower to be found by other players).
Once a certain number of clues have ben found of one player, you work out who the guilty player is. The person with the least clue points wins.
Sounds bizarre when I read this back, but it all makes sense once you play.
Light & fun but a steady hand is needed for lifting the floors of the tower.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Such a unique party game. We learned quickly that you can't simply count how many times a cube bounces off the floors of the tower, but you reslly have to focus on listening to the location of the final bounce. This is a real challenge. Always worth a laugh when you're sure you've deduced where all of the evidence is sitting, just to reveal a totally empty floor. Love this game!

RATING: 5
Cute theme with the wonderful Zoch quality of construction.  Hint - hold the top tour while tossing cubes in.  This improves the coordination a bit and helps hold the tower together making the cubes bounce around a bit more.  A nice filler to start or end an evening.  And with the ability to play 5 or 6 - makes for a semi-party type game due to the interaction and the light trash talking one could also toss into the game.  (Rating is for the game's freshness and for the niche it occupies.)

A breath of fresh air in a year dominated by games based solely on conversion mechanics.  

Dropping cubes into an elevator shaft sounds silly, but if played with enough people, this game really shines. I was surprised by how many of our guesses were wrong in spite of playing in a noisy con room...  and once you get pieces caught on incriminating floors the pressure really heats up and the game gets really hectic as you try to make someone else more of a suspect.

I truly enjoyed this and hope that others will at least look at this game to see that not everything has to be a re-themed version of an accountants ledger.

What a good little game this is to bridge the gap between child and adult gamer. Every drop of a cube all players are engaged. Kids get a hoot out of dropping the cubes in. The whole package works and is different enough from other games in my collection that it's worth the shelf space to own a copy. Fits the fun category and will see repeated play with easy rules and a 30 minute play time. Excellent.

Really fun, light and hilarious game. It's harder to track the cubes than you think. Lot's of laugh.

Made one mistake when playing the first couple games - when you suspect somebody, cubes get added to the board from the SUPPLY and not from the FLOOR. This made the game a little longer than we'd like, but the correct rule will speed things up very well.

It's a listening game! How many of those have you played? For me, it has to compare with Iglu Pop, a game that I am absolutely horrible at. It turns out I'm pretty bad at this one, too, but I had a really good time. I think I got hosed a bit where my cubes were not landing on the floor of the murder victim, therefore, I couldn't clear my name, and every time my cubes landed on the first floor, someone called that floor before I had my chance. In spite of my whining, I think this is a good game that I wouldn't mind ending a game night with.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the game where you play in a 3-dimensional tower of 7 (or 8?) levels. Each level has a hole at the top and bottom, with a large floor. The tower is seeded with a few cubes from each player as well as one red cube -- the crime scenes (2 murder victims). In Part 1, you're trying to find the red cubes. In Part 2, you either accuse other player(s) or cover your own tracks. These result in various players cubes being added to the tower (by dropping them, one by one, through the hole in the top; everyone listens to try to figure out where they've landed so they can make their guesses later). As they are discovered, player cubes are placed on the score mat on the levels they were found. The game ends when one player has only some number of cubes left. Players then earn penalty points for having cubes on the same level (3), adjacent level (2), or some other level of the tower. The player with the fewest points wins!

It's good for a play or two, but that's about it for me. Unique mechanism, but it just seemed like so much guesswork!

More fun than I expected, and a very novel experience.  This is a great filler to bring out with the family or non-gamers.  It won't work in a loud environment, although the play ends up being fairly raucous in play, and it is fun to have everyone shush one another when someone is aout to drop cubes in the tower.  Would I want to play it all the time, ugh no--this is not a frequent game night closer caliber game-- but I would not trade either as it has a unique position on the game shelf.  When you do get a request or hankering for Mord im Arosa, there really isn't a other option to take it's place.  Luckily it doesn't take up a lot of space as the box is small and perfectly designed for the contents.  The rules are also a it obtuse, but once you play it one time, you'll be able to teach others to play quickly and easily.

This is has the unique credit of being perhaps my most recommended game of such a marginal rating.

Somewhere between a "7" and an "8" lies "Murder in Arosa", presumably the only echolocation deduction game I will ever own. The art is gorgeous, the novelty value is high, and (unless the room is very noisy) it really is a game of [i]educated[/i] guessing, not wild guessing. The distinction is important.

I like this one a lot, and I expect it'll go down very well with non-gamers too. How long it will last once the novelty wears off is another question, but as a rare experience it remains great fun.

A wonderfully interesting game which really is unlike anything else I've played.

It's mildly luck heavy and chaotic and probably runs a little long given what it is, but it's a great amount of fun.

Update: I was starting to tire of this game a little as it really does too long for what it is. I'm usually one that hates tweaking rules and changing the game, but reducing the cubes each player has, from 20 to 14, and reducing the number of cubes needed on the board, from 10 to 7, seemed to really help the game and had it end possibly even too quickly.

In summary, it worked really well.

With these tweaks, rating up from 6.5 to 7.1.

Decent and different (!) party game. I think children of certain age (from 7?) would enjoy the mechanics of this game, although parents wouldn't enjoy explaining the theme to them.

Nope. It's a light game, I know that, and there are some lightweight games that I love, but this isn't one of them. The key skill is listening to where you think the cubes have landed in a (admittedly clever) 3-D stackable tower of cardboard. But no matter what, it just ends up feeling random. More than that, however, is the fact that the scoring system is boring. I just don't know where to find the tension here. The whole experience drags, and for a game that is only ~30 minutes to play, that's a kiss of death.

Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 4

RATING: 7
Works really well as a fast-playing lightweight almost party-like filler game.

In the course of investigating a murder, players have to guess the floors on which they will find other player's cubes (or their own) within the cardboard hotel with only the sounds those cubes made when dropped into the hotel for guidance. Of course, an incorrect guess means you've left more cubes around the hotel for other people to find.

A very novel game + cube tower style hotel that works much better than I'd imagined.

The physical design of this game is quite innovative, with a tower that catches dropped cubes onto one of 8 detachable floors which conceal each cube’s position.

I will likely pick up a copy when available, as this is likely to be enjoyed by a wide variety of gamers young and not so much.

RATING: 6
Mord im Arosa is a murder mystery a la cube dropping.  The main mechanic of the game is dropping cubes into a tower and listening to where they end up.  Then you make an accusation that someone's cube is on such and such floor.  

You incriminate other players by correctly guessing that their cubes are near the dead body.  Or you remove one of your cubes from the crime scene when you correctly guess where it is in the tower.  If you ever guess wrong then another of your cubes are added to the tower.  When any cubes are revealed they all get reseeded in the tower.

It's a cute game.  It relies more on dexterity and listening skills than on strategy, which is a drawback in my book.  The biggest flaw of the game to me is that it's entirely obvious when a cube gets stuck on the top tower, and that happens fairly often.  Which makes it simple for the next player to get an easy turn.

The rank is just based on a single play under suboptimal conditions. So the rating will not accurately reflect what my feelings are for the game except but a fleeting glimpse of its potential. The game is cute and I can see myself enjoying the game. I think the major question is replayability. Eventually, the cuteness will wear off and frustration will set it if I sense that listening to the clues will not reflect skill, but rather luck. 
Still, I give credit for the novel mechanism. It is truly one of a kind.

Any game with a unique idea or some unique mechanisms will call to me.  They may not always work as well as I would like them to (Master Thieves, I'm looking in your direction...), but when they do, I'm hooked.  Such is the case with Mord im Arosa.  For one thing, it's unusual to see a game whose theme is centered on a murder; for another, the tower and the floor mechanisms are just too friggin cool to pass up.  This could easily have been a kids' game (and I suppose with some thematic editing, it still could be), but the implementation of the game is such that adults should get a kick out of it, too.

Interesting mechanism which I haven't seen before, ie. listed to the sound of wooden cubes falling down the tower. Try to locate the victims first and then the clues.

Mord im Arosa is a fantastic family game, but also works very well as a filler, or closer for a group of hardcore gamers.

The story has all of us as guests at the Arosa Hotel. A cheap, sleazy hotel with paper thin walls. We're woken up in the middle of the night by a pair of gun shots, and find out that two murders have taken place. One of us must be the killer!

While this sounds like the setup for a standard deduction game, that doesn't accurately describe this little gem. Here we don't just deduce who the killer is, but one of the players is the killer (or will be blamed for the crime at the very least). Your job is to incriminate the other players, while covering up your own tracks.

The player with the most evidence against them turns out to be the killer, but there can only be one winner, this is not a cooperative game, therefore you must carefully study the evidence sheet, and spread the blame around, while covering your own tracks. This is a competitive, and funny deduction game of shifting the blame and feigning innocence.

The fact that the game is played by dropping wooden cubes into an 8-story, and three dimensional cardboard hotel is just pure awesome! Each player must pay close attention to the colors dropped into the tower to try to deduce where in the tower they landed by the sound of their bouncing. You must also try to remember which floors the other player have recently investigated, in order not to waste your turn and incriminate yourself further.

Check it out!

Interestinh mechanism and theme. One of few games where hearing is very important. With more players it can drag.

The concept is really cool and people like dropping cubes into the tower, but the gameplay falls kind of flat. The game ends suddenly and it feels like whoever lucked out on the last turn wins the game.

Furthermore, it's really easy to mess up the tower and drop sections if you're not very very careful.

A very unique idea.
I really love the packaging, too.
But, the play is less exciting.

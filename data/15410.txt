Cute dollar-store dogs, but the gameplay is pretty sour/standard: draw a card, play a card. Sometimes the card forces you to play it and you don't get to do anything.

RATING: 6.6
Played as a two-player only with the wife.  We've changed the scoring table for our two player games, decreased the bone bonus to 1 point and increased the had size to three.  Works quite well for a filler/light weight game.

I liked the game for what it was. Played our third game with a rule that was supposedly Alan's original rule, and my rating is based on playing with that rule (below) as it makes the game much better.

Each player is dealt 4 cards. Every turn, a player may either draw or play a card, and may never have more than four cards. So, the first time around, everyone plays a card and takes dogs; after that, it's Decision time. I like
what this simple tweak adds to this simple game.

One play.  It is an okay game, but the set-up time is a bit of a drag for a game which is quick and light.  I can see playing it with relatives and my young neice, but most of the gamers I know probably would rather play something like "For Sale" instead.

I hope if dogs ever take over the world, and they chose a king, they don't just go by size, because I bet there are some chihuahuas with some good ideas.

RATING: 8
This was funner than I thought it would be.  I've played several games with three and four players.  I think it's definitely best with three, and I'm not sure I'd go to five with it.  I've only played with Alan's original rule, too, that I found here on the Geek.  The components are fun to play with, but they don't fit in the box or the bag.  I'll never understand why companies do things like that.  I pitched out the box insert, so it doesn't annoy me as much anymore.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love this game.  I wish we had gotten it earlier, but I just didn't want to deal with the Tupperware-style party.  We play 2-player using BeyondMonopoly's version (posted in the game's forums) where you either draw or play on your turn, not both.  The rules are very simple and can be learned quickly.  There is some decision making on how far to push your luck.  Unfortunately, the draw bag and the box are too small to easily hold the dogs.  Chips would probably make keeping score easier for kids.  (With only 2 players, we just remove equal sets before counting.)  The doggies are very cute and fun to set up.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The toy value on this game is very, very high.    The goal is to place matching sets of dogs in a row.  The longer the set, the more points.  There are dog catcher cards that basically limit the number of dogs you could go for before losing longer sets.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good with young kids with the basic rule.  The variant rule about drawing cards makes this worthwhile with older kids or even adults--still light and fluffy, but worthwhile.

Caveat - I used to be a SimplyFun consultant, but am no longer.  This however is one of the best games they carry, excellent for children ages 4  (just remove the few 'take  that'
 cards for the littlest), and there is enough going on here for it to be fun as a light and silly filler for adults.

Walk the dogs is a fun game for dog lovers. I enjoy playing it because the strategy can be intense or real smooth depending upon the other players and your dog collection. Trying to get a certain breed of dogs can be a challenge.

Walk the Dogs is a pretty decent push-your-luck set collection game that comes with a ton of nice plastic puppies. I’ll be bringing it out a lot with my 4-10 year-olds, although there are too many better games that do the same thing for the older ones.

Great family game! kids love the little dogs too. it's a set collection type game where you play cards to grab numbers of dogs from the front, back, or both ends of a long line of dogs. trying to make your own dog line. You can only add your new dogs to the front or back of your own line. the bigger groupings of same breed earns more points. but beware the dogcatcher. he will steal you biggest exposed group of dogs in your line.

RATING: 6.25
Fun game that I think the Uno lovers out there will really enjoy. It is a quick light game that seems to be suited for the family or a quick filler game. It comes with a ton of really nice mini dogs that look good, but some of them have problems standing up due to the legs beings warped. All in all I really like this game. It is fun, plays fast and looks nice. Kids will LOVE this one.

Our family really enjoys this one.  We have played it at family gatherings with mostly adults and everyone had a good time - fast to learn and quick to play.  Best of all is that my 9 yr old daughter doesn't take too long thinking about her next move like she does in so many other games (which of course leads to much frustration from the other family members).

Rated for play with kids. The dogs are cute; too bad they don't really fit into the "doggie bag." Cards, reference card, instructions were a little bent. Probably better with more than 2 players, or once the kids get a little more practice in on it. The Dog Catcher card, which requires all to hand over some dogs, made the kids cry. :-(

Rated from a child's perspective.  How can any kid not love this game with all those plastic dog pieces?  And underneath all the chrome is a great introduction to set collecting.  Kids love lining up all the dogs, and the game plays very simply and quickly.  I think this could definitely be playable with adults, but in my mind this game is a very nice primer for more euros down the road for the kids.

If there were a Children's Games section on BGG, this would rank amongst the top 10. Requires no reading skills to play, only counting and adding and a good, shrewd sense of when to take risks and when to protect what you have. Kids can easily beat adults at this game, and funny enough, you don't even need a kid around for an excuse to play this game. Very well designed, excellent components in the miniature dogs (but the card quality leaves *a lot* to be desired). Ranks as a 10 for a children's game, 7 overall amongst other games I have.

Fun, lightweight set collection game.  The bits (little plastic dogs) make the game worthwhile.  Collect sets of dogs but beware the Dog Catcher!

Beautiful components with 60 little dogs will certainly make little kids excited to play the game (or play with the little doggies!).  The game itself isn't horrible, but isn't particularly engaging or dynamic as you play a card that will let you take 1-3 dogs from the line in the middle and add them to your line.  You are trying to place similar dogs in a line together as this grants more points.

We love dogs and although the game is more suited to the kids there is still enough for adults to enjoy. It's actually quite a clever little filler with a neat set collection mechanism (rows of dogs). This makes it a good filler for our family and is chosen frequently.
Update: 2018 Girls outgrew this and with so many better games in our collection we decided to donate it.

Good family fun with loads of nice dogs to play with.These dogs get played with as much as the game.Good fun.Also play with the variant where you all have 4 cards to start and you either play a card or you take a card on your turn.You may not have more than 4 cards.This makes for a better game for grownups and bigger children.

A great short game. The kids like setting up the line of dogs. It's not terribly deep, but there are plenty of opportunities for decisions (do I protect my big line or try to finish before the dog catcher is drawn) and sticking it to your opponent (I'll take his beagle and ruin his line!).

That odd Simply Fun distribution and corresponding(?) high price kept this one from me for a while, even though I figured it would be a hit with my family. I like light games, and we all love dogs.

As a two player game, I was really surprised by this one. There were some fun decisions that had real implications in the game. The nice toy dogs help as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I found this to be a cute little game with trivial decisions. The decisions were trivial since I had little control on what I could do each turn and one rare occasions where I did have control, the proper move was blindly obvious. I ended up winning through no fault of my own, simply because I got the worst hand of cards and had the fewest dogs through the whole game, netting me 12 points from bones. When I finally got a good card, the choice to take 3 of the same, and later steal another, was obvious. This game might be cute for kids - they'll love the dogs - or as a party game, since it's got virtually no strategy.

If I were to ever play this again it would have to be one of the variants (e.g., larger hand limit, choice to play or draw, etc.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
An awesome kids game that adults will enjoy playing too! It's simple...set out the plastic dogs in one long wavy line! Then each player will either take head dogs, tail dogs, or one from each end of the line! Each person makes there own personal string of dogs in front of themselves...trying to collect sets of matching dogs! A game everyone can enjoy!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A fairly mindless game of playing what you get (choice of 3 cards, drawn at random) to get whatever dogs are left you by the other players. There's all sorts of different dogs in a long line, and the cards you draw allow you to draw 1-3 dogs from either the front or the back, the aim being to get the same type of dogs all together in your line. The more groups of same type you can get, the better the score, get 5 in a row and you win. So you need to be mindful of what the next player needs so you don't gift them things, but usually the cards you drop so limit your options that you pretty much get what you get and you don't get upset. Someone wins, it was a bit of a laugh, then move on.

Fun, light family game with excellent bits. Another set collecting game from Moon, but this one has an interesting twist: you collect sets in a line without being able to rearrange. Playing with the advanced rules is recommended, as it allows you to "pass" to protect your set from interruption, and there is nice strategy introduced for deciding when to cut off your sets to guard against the dogcatcher. Easy enough to understand that even young children can play effectively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice bits (the dogs) and a relatively simple game make this a fun game to play with youngsters.  It could be a light filler for gamers, but I find the game a bit too dependant on the luck of the card draw combined with the luck of the dog line to be anything more than a beer and pretzels type of game.

Only one play so far.  Not too much strategy, but the cute bits and the easy rules make it a great game for my family.  The dog catcher and leash cards give it a little bit of take that and push your luck aspect that give the game that fun factor that will keep it in my collection.

This is a game that has been sitting on my want list for a long time simply because of the theme as my wife and kids really like dogs.  Unfortunately, the fact that it is by Simply Fun has kept it out of my collection.  Still, I would like to add it someday.  As for the play, there is definitely something to be desired there.  You really are at the mercy of your cards.  I found that often all of your choices were bad.  The most annoying part is the blue cards that either randomly hurt players, though one often more than the other, or give them what tends to be a pretty nice bonus.  This is fine for a game with kids, but really makes it less than pleasant if you want to take the game seriously.  [03/14/2008]

1 play, 3er.

With it's very cute dog figurines, it looks like a children's game. But it's not. At least, it's not just that. Actually, it's a pretty clever abstract set-collection game that plays very quickly -- ought to be a great little filler!

--- Summary ---
Randomly arrange the dogs in a long line. Each player gets 2 cards, which have 1-3 dog fronts or rears, or 1 each front/rear. There are also 3 collars, 3 dog catchers, and 5 bones. On your turn, either play a card or draw a card (hand limit 4 cards). If you play a dog card, take as many dogs as pictured, from front/rear of line, then add them (in any order) to your personal dog line. If you play a collar, steal one dog from front/rear of any player's line and add to yours. If you get a set of 5 like dogs in a row, you win immediately. If you draw bone, give it to the player with the fewest cards. If dog catcher revealed, all players lose the longest clump of dog breed on either front or rear of their line. With the latter 2 cards, you do get to draw another card to add to your hand instead.

The game ends when all dogs are taken (or when deck exhausted?). Score 3VP/bone card collected, and VP for sets of dogs (same breed adjacent to each other in your line). VP based on size of sets (1/2/3/4 = 1/4/9/16). Most VP wins!

Alan Moon's Variant: Deal 4 cards to each player (not 2), and on your turn you may EITHER draw OR play a card. You have a hand limit of 4 cards.

The game works, but is fairly boring. I bought it with my grandchildren in mind, thinking that they might play with the dogs, then be interested in learning the game.

[SimplyFun 2005 edition] {Animals, children; set-collection; optimal 4p} Walk the dogs is a nice family game. It's easy to teach and learn. In addition, it's easy to visualize the game plan. It's a lightweight game - players have limited decisions and need only project a few steps; nevertheless, players can still have many tactical moves to increase their scores. There are some luck and chaos in this game (esp. with more players); however, players with nicer hand-management skill have more chances to win. It's also interactive; esp. players have to prevent other players from collecting 5 dogs in a row. The major drawback of this game is its low accessibility and price; otherwise, it'd be an excellent family game.

The dogs are soooooooooooooooooooooo cute. The cards are cute, too. It's a decently produced game.

[House rule] A hand of 4 cards would be better for adults. The game is quite luck dependent with a hand of 3 cards.

My eight-year-old daughter, loves the game just as much for the gameplay as for the little plastic dogs.  Personally, I think it's a rather clever set-collecting game and I really enjoy playing it with her and her friends. A home run with its intended audience.

It loses points because:
(a) I can't figure out what the Doggie Bag is for. The dogs barely fit back in the box as it is, and if they're stored in the Doggie Bag there's no chance of that box closing. Curious.
(b) I can't say I'm a fan of Simply Fun's distribution method. Party Shmarty, lemme just buy the damn game, willya?

Rated after one play with my son. I'll make sure this hits the table again soon with the rest of my family. I can see some nice simple strategies in the game with both reward and punishment for risk taking. Nicely balanced game. And the tactile play with the dog pieces just makes the game shine that much more.

It's early, but this is the first official game of my unofficial 'Finally Get My Games Played' 2011 project. I thrifted this game a while back but the dog count was off. So instead of playing it as-is to get a feel for the game it languished on the shelf. Today I thrifted another copy that was complete. So we got it to the table right away. This one is a keeper that should easily see some more plays.

Cool little game.  Nice dogs.  Really only compelling for Children.  There is some merit, and a tiny bit of strategy there, but really there's much better.  

I'll keep it around just for the dogs and it's appeal to kids though.

Simple and very cute. I'd recommend what I recall as Alan Moon's original rules in which players are dealt 4 cards to begin with and on their turn may play OR draw a card (to a maximum hand size of 4), rather than doing both. This small tweak in the rules makes the players' decisions more interesting and creates a more strategic game.

This is a very light game, takes little time and effort to set up, learn and play. Good for young players and non-gamers who would be taken with the cute little sculpted miniature dogs.

Alan Moon and Aaron Weissblum strike again.  A clever game that is simple to learn and can be played by anyone aged 5 and up!!!

Good children's game. I'll have to give the variant rules a try sometime. Amazing bits. Dawn was interested. "Where did you get that?", she asked. I had to explain how I got it in a geek trade, and what was the geek, and all that.

Light set collection game that works excellently with children.  The game uses adorable little plastic dogs that are lined up head to tail in a long line.  Then players play cards to collect dogs from the front or back of the line to build up their own line of dogs.  The dog catcher and leash cards can cause players to lose dogs from their line if they are not protected.  Points are scored for large collections of contiguous like dogs on your personal line.

Good game but for the price the cards with the game are some of the worst I've ever seen.  They are paper thin and bend very easily.  I thought the quality could have been better.

Didn't really tickle my fancy.  Should be a decent enough game for family with children and probably pet lovers too.  However, I'm definitely not the intended audience for it.  A merely average set collection with a slight tension until all of the dog catcher and lasso/collar cards are drawn.  Setup is painfully long though.

Coge perritos y agregalos al principio o al final de tu grupo. Ten cuidado con el perrero. Si un jugador logra tener 5 perros de la misma raza juntos gana. De lo contrario gana quien obtenga más PV cuando se agoten los perros del "espiral" central.

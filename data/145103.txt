This game has a pretty good theme attached. And one that I do not think has been used anywhere else. The polish defense of this city is something that is really lost to history. However, while the theme is well represented it doesn't pose a challenge for the players. The first game we played was on the easiest setting and it was a breeze. So that was the learning game. But all subsequent games on more difficult settings still posed little to no challenge. And while not all co-ops need to be Ghost Stories or Atlantis Rising level of hard, they still need to challenge the players and this game just didn't.

Fantastic subject for a game.  Excellent production quality--bless their hearts, they even added four extra mine discs because those originally included weren't the same color as the illustrations in the rulebook!  Now that's dedication to customers.  Having seen the movie, I'd like to say that the game is at least as evocative of the battle, indeed more so.

The game System might be a bit too simple. But there are different Setup possible and therefore each game is different. You can increase or decrease the difficulty and in the end you face some real stress to Keep the Germans away.

This is a cool take on the co-op game concept.  Games are quick and the AI really puts the pressure on the players to work well as a team and maximize their resources.  Too bad this game doesn't have wider distribution.  As much as I enjoyed the game I would not pay over MSRP for it.

I am fully enjoying this game right now. Since I received it I have been playing it daily either with others or solo. Mechanically this game is extremely simple:
1. Move and take an action
2. Germans attack
3. New Germans enter the battle and the ones already there move.

You get completely bombarded - it is truly a battle of attrition - you are, simply, trying to limp your way to the end of day 7. In this sense I believe the game has done an excellent job of recreating a very significant event in history.

Thematically I love this game. My only issue is that the theme breaks down a little with the Morale track. Morale is always reset to neutral if you achieve the highest level or have been beaten down to the lowest level. I understand that this is required to make the game work, but it doesn't feel right.

This would be an excellent game to introduce new gamers too, or coop board games to experienced gamers - especially if the theme is more inline with their tastes.

Not bad; entry level coop. 
My problem with it was re-playability and "box size" as it was half full.
WW2 theme is not for everyone.

Quite a good pure co-op.  Streamlined play and clear rules made the going good.  The only knock is that players could not really interact except when on the same shooting space.  I think ammo sharing would have added a bit more interactivity.  On the other hand, no co-op qb issues.

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:
A good enough co-op where you are in a Thermopylae-like battle against a never-ending onslaught of Nazis. The game has the exact feel of the old Space Invaders video game, where you are running back and forth shooting at constantly advancing bad guys. It's a good time, but nothing ground-breaking.

The game could easily have been themed around zombies swarming a location, so I really appreciate that they used a historical theme instead.

Un cooperativo un po' freddo, in cui ci si difende - o, almeno, ci si prova - da un attacco portato con i carri armati durante la seconda guerra mondiale. Sembra lasciare poche alternative di gioco ai singoli.

I have played solo at the easiest level (as it was my first game). The mechanism felt a bit odd to begin with as if I was missing one or two things, however this changed when the Germans started knocking bricks off my wall and at some points it felt a quite tense. The mechanism is fairly simple, 1) move your piece, 2) Do the action your piece is on, 3) Resolve German attack (usually not a lot) 4) German advance. It is phase 4 that brings the tension and most of the action, all the time you are keeping them away from your walls (using some the actions of phase 2) you are relatively safe and phase 4 is where you see if your plans have worked. Once the Germans reach the walls though your world will start to crumble as will your walls and once through your walls they start to attack your key buildings, the loss of 2 buildings loses you the game. The game played well with a smooth mechanism, I have yet to try the other levels or play multiplayer but I suspect that it plays equally well. It is not quite a war-game the mechanisms and feel of the game are more in line with the co-operative games that are out there (which this game is) however saying that the theme does fit and works quite well, on top of that the history behind this situation is very interesting of which a little background is given in the rules. Give this one a go - you will not be disappointed.

Coop, usually not my favorite genre. 

Initial rating, after one tense game. This one works good enough that I'd like to play again. Maybe I should have bought it at Essen...

I liked the tenseness and the general way the game works. I also like that are some different levels of 'toughness' you can play this games. But I thought the morale swings a bit too much, and despite the options to make it harder I have some doubts about replayability. It feels like the kinda game you have to develop a 'group growth' feel for, and after that you pretty much know what to do.

If I had liked coops I would have rated this an 8. It's better than Pandemic for example.

Pretty exciting coop about defending a line against incoming german troops.  Three difficulty levels.  Variability generated by different defense bunker setups.  Wish the attacks had some variation.  Played pretty quickly and ke[t us rivited.

Tower defence mechanic.

Nice design at its core, simple really, but needs maybe some roles to sustain replayability. 

Also it has a tendency towards being too hard and too repetitive, most days 5-6-7 will have you facing more stuka bombers than actual troops (since these have been destroyed and removed from the game to act as a timer for the ending of the days), I feel this is a design flaw.

This is a co-operative card-driven war game. In this simple and straightforward Polish tower defence game, players represent members of the Polish resistance in WWII. They have to hold back the overwhelming force of a German bombardment and invasion, winning by surviving for the 'seven days' represented in the game.

RATING: 6.5
It's a good coop game mechanic-wise, and the theme is actually quite well-implemented and integrated. Interesting decisions, but I can't help the feeling that there's just one way to win this. 

What I can't stand about this game, is how inconsistently it is produced. I don't like the board: morale track feels very cheap, fonts feel very cheap, card graphics don't fit the board, bah, even ammunition is blue (what?). Overall, the game presents itself in a very dark, gloomy, brown-green-black palette, that generates somewhat "bad" energy, coming from the board game. Fans of war and warfare should be fine with it, I couldn't digest it.

08-11-2014. Rated after 1 (incomplete) play. We played a 2 player game at a convention. 

7 Days is a fun game, which is a fairly typical cooperative game. The aim of the game is to survive 7 days (or 7 rounds), while enemy troops advance on the players. Each round, the players have to fight back those troops by killing them or pushing them back. Troops that advance to right up your defenses damage your defenses, do air-raids and bombardements. You lose when your defenses are removed and 2 buildings (that reflect protective actions) are destroyed.

Fun game, but quite similar to other cooperative boardgames. Theme is quite strong and the game looks fine.

This is a brilliant take on something I've been trying to do for some time as a designer: a cooperative Wargame. It's a very well done game that is well worth the time and effort required to find it.

Why did I get rid of it? Well, to be quite frank, after about six plays, one of our members "solved it." There is a solution to the game that virtually guarantees victory every time, in fact - I've never seen it fail. It will -not- be obvious to you on the first, second, or even third play, and you may not come across it until you've really got some experience with the game. But I can't ignore that it's now been solved, since getting rid of the solution would make the game unplayable.

I would rate this higher, if not for that flaw, which quite honestly is not always apparent when designing a game. Some of the most brilliant games ever devised have obvious solutions.

Cooperative game with a WW2 theme.  All the players fight against the marching hordes of Germans.  It is sort of a solo game.  I liked it, but I doubt it would hit the table very often in my group so I didn't buy a copy.

Unique both in its subject and that it's a co-op set in a WWII conflict.  Nice components and a good "castle defense" feel to it.  The solo aspect is what appeals to me though it might be interesting with more as well.

I like the theme, artwork and concept but unless there's some major error in the English rules translation the game is way, way too easy for a co-op

i am not a fan of cooperative games but this one is among those that i liked. Well rendered theme, good components, good rhytm and most of all good rendition of the tension and anxiety of the siege. Our victory in 4 players at the easiest level was incredibly tight and i am told this is quite usual.
Probably a bit too repetitive and not very replayable, hence not a stellar rating

Cooperative war-based strategic hold-the-fort game. We are trying to defend our Free City of Danzig from German occupation with only a narrow canal separating us.  For seven days we must rebuild defenses, lay tactical strikes, conserve ammo and steady morale to defy overwhelming German forces and unrelenting howitzer bombardment from their battleship Schlesweig-Holstein. A German A & B deck advances the German forces (reminds me of Ghost stories advancement). Our meeples run around to defend strategic points and use random action tiles. We lose if any two areas lose all their bricks cubes.

GAME: Exit: The Game – The Abandoned Cabin
RANK: 230
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This has been my favourite escape room board game so far.  I found the system better than Unlock! and on par with Escape Room: The Game.  The puzzles were very enjoyable and many were cleverly designed.  While the theme is quite thin, there was one puzzle that tied it together and since the puzzles were so enjoyable it didn't bother me at all.

For some reason, I found this easier than the Unlock! scenarios I've tried and never got stuck (we did take a couple of hints but were always close/on the right track).

My one complaint is that this shouldn't be consumable.  They could have very easily made this resettable.  I wish in retrospect that we didn't write on it since the game can be completed without destroying the components if you just use paper/pencil to write on.

Played with 3.  I would say 1-3 players is fine.  More than 3 not recommended.

Favourite puzzles : Dominoes, My Cruel Game, and the map based one.

While I hate the notion of disposable games, the puzzles provided a nice challenge, good variety and a collegial experience. I’d definitely enjoy playing another Exit game. While ostensibly a cooperative game it’s really a session of communal puzzle solving.

Another good Exit game.  Seems just difficult enough.  The puzzles are starting to repeat, but as long as I put some time between these, they are still enjoyable.  $15 well spent.

A ton of fun, with puzzles and riddles and tension.

There were a couple puzzles that didn't seem quite as well-designed and caused some confusion, and a couple strange parts where we solved a clue but didn't know what it was supposed to unlock.

Overall, very enjoyable and I look forward to playing more scenarios.

You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

Well done collection of puzzles. There was one puzzle that really exhibited how well they distilled the escape room experience to a board game package. On the flip side, they made sure to highlight that this is still a cardboard version, which felt a bit gimmicky. 

We discussed it for awhile afterwards too. Well worth the money.

Note that if you are careful and use ample use of pen and paper, you will not need to destroy anything in this Exit game.

A great experience. A good mix of "easy win" puzzles along with tougher ones that make you think. This one also gave us a couple notable "wow" moments that I did not expect. This was the first time playing a game from the EXIT series and it makes me want to play others now. Compared to Escape Room: The Game, I would say this is around the same level of enjoyment as I like that one quite a bit as well. Escape Room has a timer (which adds tension) as well as a bit more freedom in puzzle types. EXIT has more puzzles overall giving you more feeling of progress.

(SPOILER FREE) This is the second of these one and done games that we've done, and I liked it slightly better despite liking the theme of the secret lab more. The puzzles were interesting and a little less linear. We had a few really fun moments of realization where you could see both of our faces light up at the same time. 

If you like other escape the room type games these are very good and are also fairly small and easy to take somewhere. You will do some cutting and writing, and so you can't use this one more than once. Also I think more than 4 people would probably struggle to keep everyone involved. 

Long story short, if you like these kinds of games, you'll probably like this one too.

We had a lot of fun and some beautiful surprises with this little gem. 13€ and 90 minutes well spent.

Pro tip: If you're just a bit careful while playing, you can actually play this game without damaging any of the components. You then can give the game to another person after you've completed it.

RATING: 9
Thoroughly enjoyable "escape room" in a box. Much better than the Unlock! series, in my opinion, also. The main downside is this is a play-once and done in the truest sense of the word - as the key components of the game have largely been destroyed, so it can't even be gifted/sold on once played. So despite feeling a bit wasteful, the game was great fun and pretty challenging at times - but definitely worth the 13 quid.

Opinión sin spoilers. He probado tanto Escape Room: The Game (Diset) y este, y las sensaciones son parecidas. En este juego, al estar todo gestionado con cartas te cuesta meterte un poco más en la historia pero la experiencia está bien para el precio que tiene. Te da entorno a dos horas de entretenimiento y lo recomendaría para grupos pequeños (3-4 como máximo).
Después de la primera partida en mi caso quedó injugable de nuevo (pero no tuvimos cuidado al resolver los diferentes acertijos).

Preisleistung ist völlig in Ordnung, da die gesamte Gruppe eine gute Zeit lang beschäftigt ist. Als "Aufwärmer“ oder „Absacker“ für einen Spieleabend ist Exit meiner Meinung nach nicht geeignet.

Rätsel und Knobelfreunde mit dem gewissen Ehrgeiz kommen hier sicherlich auf ihre Kosten!

++ Nice easier difficulty level and this one should be your starting point to the EXIT series IMO.
++ There is one think  "outside the box" puzzle that is clever (but this one could pose problems for some though!).
++ We got one "Wow!" moment in this game (but it could have been 2 if we would have played this game before another one released afterward).
++ A variety of good and diversified puzzles (4 or 5).

Interestingly enough, we played Unlock: Island of Dr Goorse, first, and loved it!  My wife and I played Unlock: Squeek & Sausage and enjoyed it too.  Finally my wife and I played this game.  We enjoyed it, but I found myself enjoying the Unlock series more.  I’ll gave to try out another one, since this is the first in the series.

Also, really didn’t need to ‘destroy’ parts of this game.  Seemed like a shame to waste it on the times we did.

RATING: 8
Out of the initial three EXIT: The Game scenarios, this was my second favorite. They do a very good job of imitating the Escape Room experience. After escaping from an Escape Room I usually have a state of euphoria, which these games managed to duplicate very well. The theme of this one was pretty fun. Usually you can only solve one puzzle at a time though so I think having 6 players is quite ambitious and believe even 4 might be pushing it. We completed all of them with just two, admittedly not getting very good scores. I do look forward to more in the series mostly because the price is very affordable, even though you typically end up destroying the game through the process of playing it.

This provided a truly excellent escape room-type experience that was really engaging and fun throughout, with a few neat and unexpected twists along the way.

Lots of fun puzzles, at a good level of difficulty for the gaming crowd. It might trend a bit easy if you're an awesome puzzle solver, as I consider myself not that awesome at puzzles, and we made it as a three person team without needing to use any clues.

As an experience, it's probably a 9 in terms of the fun I had and how much I look forward to playing other games in the series, but it feels a bit odd giving it any more than an 8 as something that's one and done after about an hour. A fun hour though!

RATING: 6.8
Enjoyable but I lamented the lack of a built in time pressure element. It does utilize time for scoring, but it doesn't feel like a boot is on your neck as it does in Unlock! and the Spinmaster Escape Room game. I also dislike that everything is organized in a central booklet and would have preferred individual handouts.

This is a quality game and features some great puzzles, but overall I think I prefer Unlock! for its rapid unrelenting pace, and Escape Room: The game for its stronger physical presentation, easy division of labor between clues, and amazing plastic decoder machine.

If you're looking for a good escape room in a box, this is well worth the purchase. The price is GREAT, the puzzles are quite good, and it's a fun experience all around. Better than a real escape room? Nah. Better than the vast majority of escape rooms in a box, though - second only to the Escape Room: The Game series.

The cabin might be my favorite of the three so far. It's a good starting point, though the rest aren't very different in terms of difficulty. If you get one, though, I'd do this.

See my comment for Exit: The Secret Lab for further info. The Exit series of game is pretty good, but this escape room (The Abandoned Cabin) was WAY too easy... We managed to get out in 39 minutes without using a single clue card. While a lot of the tasks and riddles were quite interesting and cleverly done, it all kind of falls flat when the game is so easy... We were hoping to have a similar experience as we had with The Secret Lab, which had some tough riddles, but this one was unfortunately too easy to really enjoy, which is a shame considering the otherwise enjoyable riddles.

As with Tomb, a ton of fun for the price-point, and amazing how well they did which such a small package. Playing one of the games in the series will make the other a bit easier, and even then, for me there were several really easy puzzles in Cabin that I solved immediately (although, since I was playing with my family, I let them take time to try it themselves). Cabin was my second and my family's first, and they can't wait to try the others.

Of note: One of the riddles had each of us spot an element of the puzzle, resulting in a group effort that we won't soon forget.

The set of puzzles is very well done with the riddle cards providing a novel way of advancing the game. There is not much attempt to build a story like the ThinkFun 'Escape the Room' games, but the implementation of the puzzles is good. 12+ age range is about right with two of my kids able to participate and help.

Haven't played the others in this series, but understand they are bit harder/obtuse.

I enjoyed my one and only play of this game. It was a nice change of pace and a fun way to get some non-gamers to the the table. The idea of having kind of an escape room at home is interesting and it wasn't too hard to get people to join. 
A few more challenging puzzles would have been nice. Once we understood the general "flow" of the game, it wasn't too hard to figure out most of the puzzles.

Now I'm curious how the other systems implement this idea.

Since we played it, this goes directly to "previously owned."  Since this is a one-use game, I will rate it against other one-use games.  I have played Escape Room:  The Game, Unlock:  The Demo Version, and this.  We have played four of the ER:TG rooms, and one each of Exit and Unlock.  In a nutshell, if you ask me, "Should I get Unlock, Exit, or ER:TG?" My answer will be "Yes!"  Get all of them.  There are things I like about all of them.  Let's talk about clues.  In ER:TG you get them at timed intervals, and they cost you nothing, but sometimes they just tell you things that you already know.  In Unlock, I don't remember exactly how they work, but the app gives them to you if you ask for them, and I think that some of them cause time penalties if you ask for too many.  In this game, you get 3 for each puzzle.  Clue 2 will give you more information then clue 1 did.  A clue which tells you nothing that you didn't already know does not deduct from your score, but one which helps you, will deduct from it.  If you need Clue 3 for any particular puzzle, it will just give you the answer.  That means that there is no getting stuck here, you can always continue.
Of the three formats, all are somewhat linear, but this one seems to be the least linear, and you can work on several clues at the same time, meaning that everybody can be engaged in something, maybe unless you are playing with the maximum number of players.  Unlock so far seems to be the game that has the fewest things that you can do at once, and after playing the demo, I would probably recommend it for 2 or 3 players at most.  The sweet-spot for this is probably 3 or 4 and ER:TG seems to be 4 or 5.
This game would take a fair amount of work to keep it re-playable for a different group.  ER:TG gives you a website where you can DL and then print the items that you consume, and I'm not sure about Unlock yet.  
I like the wheel aspect of this game for opening the locks, and I also like the key and timer box of ER:TG.  The colors aspect of Unlock seems to be slightly laking, but not much.
All in all around $20 for an hour or two of fun for a group of several people seems like a no-brainer if you like escape rooms where you pay up to $35 per person.  The deal on ER:TG the base game is even better.  Unlock also seems like it will be3 good, and I am anxiously awaiting for it to become available here in the states.

I'm glad I played, because it's my first experience of the escape room genre, but I'm not the target market.  I love games, but I don't really enjoy puzzles that much.  I enjoyed the cooperative team aspect of the game.  That part worked well.  But it reminds me a bit of standardized testing.  Sometimes you don't understand what they are looking for if you're not familiar with the genre, so it can be a bit frustrating when you finally figure out what you were supposed to be doing.  I think it took our group a little over an hour to finish, and it probably over stayed it's welcome by about 10 minutes.  Mostly because of a puzzle that we were trying to finish that we weren't supposed to be trying to finish.  We were supposed to be doing another puzzle in order to get more info on the original puzzle.  Oh.  That would have been obvious to people who are familiar with the genre.  It was just frustrating to us.  Opening up the clues feels like failure.  Getting clues that we already know feels worse since you already feel like a failure and the "clue" brings you no closer to your goal.

Anyhow, it was fun.  I'd play another one under the right circumstances and with the right people.  It's just not my favorite genre.

That is to say, if you haven't had the experience of going to and solving a real escape room (which I highly recommend), you probably won't appreciate what this game attempts to do.  From a board game collector's perspective, you will commit several sins when playing this game and by the time you're done, you will have only the experience left behind and the game is essentially useless.

That being said, if you have access to photocopiers or stuff of the like, then perhaps you can mitigate the "damage" you are expected to do to its contents and attempt to re-sell or trade it, but when you compare the price tag of the little card-driven game versus the price of the real deal, then maybe you'll feel better about the destruction of materials.  While I don't necessarily agree with the overall wastefulness of the experience, it is what it is and it doesn't affect my score.  Okay?  Okay.

Now, let's get down to business - the Abandoned Cabin was our first foray into the Exit series and what it attempts to do is simulate the experience of the escape room phenomenon.  For those of you unaware, the concept started as little flash games on the Internet and then adapted into (occasionally well-produced) real life experiences, locking you and a team of players into a room with normally a one-hour time limit to escape.  Rooms typically give you nothing to start with but perhaps a theme and then you're left to your own devices.  You hunt down clues, find all kinds of locks and puzzles and you have only your wits to get you through the challenge.  While the game itself cannot possibly capture the experience as a whole (and there's no comparison, really), it does manage to get the feeling right, and as you advance through each puzzle, that elation of "I'm so smart" kicks in and you get a similar rush to the real deal.

How it accomplishes this is simply through a booklet, a stack of cards, and a multi-layered decoder wheel.  Without any spoilers, you'll essentially find locked objects/items/doors/whatever that correspond to a specific column on the wheel and using clues found in the game, you'll be able to punch in the corresponding codes to open them.  How this works comes from a small stack of "Answer Cards" that are numbered on their backs.  The code wheel will point you to one of these cards and whichever one you pull will either tell you you're right or your wrong, sometimes with an intermediate step of getting another answer card in the process.  Most of the time, the correct answer will allow you to pull specific cards (lettered this time) from the Riddle Card deck, which will present you with more clues and more stuff to open.  It's quite a little genius piece of work and it mostly does its job flawlessly.

I say mostly because we actually managed to solve one of the puzzles (journal, FYI) in the completely wrong way and just by circumstance of the design of the game, it worked out and we were none the wiser until we checked afterward.  We were able to check, of course, because each puzzle also has a stack of hint cards.  In the real life experience, you can normally call the game runners into the room to get a hint if you're really stuck; since you're on a time limit, nothing is more frustrating than getting completely stonewalled, so the Exit series includes a hint system.  At the cost of your final star rating (which is meaningless), you can reveal hints in 3 steps for each of the available puzzles.  The first simply tells you what you need to have, the second is a stronger hint, and the third is the solution so you can move on.  It's a nice touch that the solution cards actually tell you the reasoning behind the puzzle instead of just presenting you with the answer and letting you go on your merry way.

Thus, the problems with Exit are the same as the real deal - your understanding of the puzzles and how to solve them are going to be greatly influenced by your understanding of how the designer thinks.  Normally when you go to an escape room center, there are multiple rooms available for you to try.  As you complete them, you get a sense of how the designer thinks and what kind of puzzles to expect.  On your first room, however (such was the case of the Abandoned Cabin with us), you have a disadvantage in that you'll run into a puzzle that just doesn't mesh with the way you think, but totally makes sense to people who have encountered similar puzzles in other rooms.

You can tell the quality of a puzzle when, by looking at the solution, you either go "Oh, wow, we're stupid" or "Oh, wow, [i]that's[/i] stupid."  In the former, it means you weren't thinking hard enough.  In the latter, it means that the design was completely obtuse and only previous experiences would have brought you to such a conclusion.  I've seen this time and again when I watch other people play video games - given that I've been doing it my whole life, my brain is wired to understand the language of video game puzzles, but when someone is a little wetter around the ears, watching them struggle through something I find easy can be unnerving until I realize that it's only easy for those who have experience.  Thankfully, in the Abandoned Cabin, we only found one puzzle that we called complete bullshit on and it cost us 3 hint cards.  At the same time, it now conditions us for the puzzles in the next two titles, so it's not all that bad.

Okay, final word - we definitely took scissors and markers to the material so there is absolutely no way for us to repackage the game and give it to someone else.  If the price tag of these games was much higher, I'd balk at the idea, but given that it's a fraction of the price of one entry into the real deal (and keep in mind that each player normally has to pay for entry) and that you can play it with as many or as few people as you like, this didn't bother me as much from that perspective.  As a collector, I screamed and died a little on the inside, but you get over that quickly.  As with the real escape rooms, the experience is what you take away with you and while it won't replace the full experience, it definitely gives you a great taste of it for pennies in comparison.

RATING: 7.5
This was the third in the Exit series that we played - first Secret Lab, then Pharaoh's Tomb. I enjoyed this one the most of three, but still prefer the Unlock series. If you get just one Exit game, I recommend this one.

One factor that contributed to my enjoyment is that I played this one with only one other person. One negative with this series is that the artwork is simply too small. We've literally used magnifying glasses to examine the cards (and it is important!). So, the small art combined with fewer players meant better engagement.

We enjoyed the puzzles in this one. Some were very clever. The final puzzle was somewhat anti-climatic. We had enough experience going into this one to make some early discoveries. There is a puzzle similar to one in the Unlock series, and I think Unlock handled it much better. 

The theming of the puzzles is rather weak.

RATING: 8
The game successfully creates an escape room vibe, but at a lower price and with a smaller group of people. However, the fact that the game takes place on a table rather than in a room, and played primarily with a deck of cards rather than real world objects, drastically limits the types of puzzles available to the designers. Luckily for us, these are some creative designers and the various puzzles are interesting, while being neither too obvious nor too obscure. As such, EXIT is able to mimic the tension, stress, and emotional outbursts common to traditional escape rooms. Don't worry about it being a one-off experience, because both its novelty, and low price of admission makes this a must try.

This game was o.k. for an escape room experience. Definitely worse than Unlock! It didn't make a lot of logical sense (You solved a puzzle, so now you get to turn and look at a different side of the cabin? Why didn't I just turn my body and look over there?), and the puzzles were so-so. Also, the smooth app integration of Unlock is replaced with a lot of unnecessary decks for clues.

On top of this, you rarely wonder what items go to which puzzle, as they are all labeled with a symbol (square, triangle, circle, etc.). Definitely doesn't need to be destructible. A fun, but ultimately inferior escape room game.

2 adults, one 13-yr old.  We did not read the rules and solve in under 60 mins., but the 13 yr old who was initially reticent, got into it and helped us exit.  It was worth taking a bit of extra time to allow for his engagement. More of a puzzle than a game but ok it's a type of puzzle game.

An escape room in a box with a good series of puzzles. It was a worthwhile experience, but it has no replay value and got destroyed while we were playing it, so I can't even pass it along or trade it away now that I've played. Despite the one-shot use nature, I vastly prefer the Exit series to the Unlock series.

Really interesting mix of puzzles and although it is very linear and you must solve one puzzle to give you enough information to solve the next it was really good fun.
A good group activity although I would not want to play with more than 3-4 people and it simulates the escape room feel very well. 
Puzzles are varied and tax all areas of you brain, encouraging you to think outside the box.
Really happy to have played through this and happy that I got to play with the daughter.

[Spoiler Free] I think this game is an interesting take on real escape room.  This was my first game from this series and I was genuinely surprised with the originality of the puzzles.  We were 4 when we played it.  We had a few drinks and we failed miserably according to the scoring board, but we still had lots of fun.

With this said, I think this game is more suited for 1 to 3 players. While you can play with more player, there is not enough puzzle to solve at the same time.  You can certainly help other figure it out, but not everyone can look at the booklet or clues at the same time and this lead to downtime for some players.

We were very happy with the puzzles, riddles and the whole story in this small box. Given that there are mostly cards, a decoder wheel and a small booklet to guide us, give clues and new tasks, the authors were very creative in using all the materials that are there. They even came up with some surprises... 
There was something for everyone, and all the puzzles felt very different. Everyone at the table was involved the whole time, and as a team we were able to crack even the hardest puzzles and find the hidden clues.

This was a lot of fun. I don't know how much I care to say so as to avoid spoilers other than that the puzzles were fun, clever, and for the most part fair. There was one in particular that felt a bit ambiguous and that could easily have had a handful of roughly equally good solutions. Granted the correct solution didn't seem any worse than any of our most reasonable failed attempts but it didn't feel significantly better either. But anyway, other than that the puzzles might have leaned a bit easy. The game is just the right length, I still could have used one or two more puzzles at the end, which means it ended before I started getting bored and now I'm definitely interested in trying the rest of these games.

Played this with my wife and I haven't seen her get this excited over a game before. This is a fantastic game!! It took us an hour and a half to solve the game and we only needed 4 clues. The game is very clever in the way you check your answers and some of the riddles left us totally blown away in the best possible way! 
I would recommend this game to everyone!! 
Also as a side note, the game suggests you must destroy the game to play it, as a one time play. We used paper and pens to help solve puzzles and create the things needed to solve the game. The game is in perfect condition to bring it out in a few years to play again or pass it onto a friend to try.

The Exit series seems to consist of solving puzzles in order to get combinations of numbers, colors or codes in order to unlock more clues to solve other puzzles until you successfully solve the final puzzle. The code wheel is the heart of the game where you can test your answers to see whether or not you were correct. The system works well and we look forward to solving the growing number of versions of this game.

The puzzles in the Abandoned Cabin were mostly challenging without being too much so. We felt the balance was quite good. We got through it in 1 hour and 40 minutes with only a few hints and that was enough to earn us 5 stars. There is certainly room for improvement! It was a great way to spend a lazy morning.

Rating a game like this is kinda difficult.
You can only play it once and therefore not really rate it according to BGG's rating system.
That being said my SO and me had an awesome evening with lots of laughter and surprisingly tough challenges. 
Also we did not destroy any of the games component while playing. You will need pen and paper one way or another and by writing/drawing more things than technically needed you can save your copy of the game. 
We will let our gaming friends borrow this game from us and hope that they will have as much fun as we did (and maybe also perform as poorly as we did)

Got out in an hour and a half, burning one clue on the first puzzle while getting our head around the game structure. A fun enough social framework for sitting around to solve some puzzle-book puzzles, and cleverly designed in cardboard - the codewheel is nice for allowing wrong answers in a way that looking up solutions in the back of a book doesn't.

Rozwiązywanie zagadek takie escape room. Wycina się karty i dopasowuje jak puzzle by uzyskać odpowiedź, jaką kartę dobrać następną dowiadujemy się ze sprytnego kółka dekodującego. Również wszystko zależy od dobrego tłumaczenia bo przy dużej ilości błędów może nie być możliwa do ukończenia. Podobna do Unlocka jednak zdaje się że ma mniej irytujących błędów i nie wymaga smartfona.

I am glad I played it to see what the escape room games are all about; and what the designers created here is truly an amazing feat. With that said, I found the game more frustrating than fun and do not see my self delving deeper into this genre of games. Note: Price point of this game is a plus that needs to be mentioned.

My group really enjoyed this game. We have played all the Unlock! games, which I also recommend. I definitely like the way this was structured over the unlock series, however my only gripe is that half the cards are dedicated to Hints, which are probably helpful, but we never used. I wish there were more puzzles, and that there was a companion app which would show and keep track of hints used as well as keep track of time. I do like the decoder being a separate item, it's well made and fun to use. 

Overall definitely recommended if your group likes these types of games, I would probably stand by the 12+ age limit since some of the riddles are more obscure and other than counting objects I don't think it would entertain younger children.

RATING: 5
Strictly inferior escape room experience compared to the Unlock series. It feels like you're solving a children's activity book of puzzles, complete with word scrambles, mazes, and missing item hunts. Unlike Unlock, there is little overarching narrative or theme to tie the puzzles together and no immersion. The app component in Unlock provides thematic music, audio clues/riddles, and MUCH more creative puzzles. After playing Unlock, Exit just felt old-fashioned. Particularly disappointing was the fact that all the puzzles had a 3-digit solution. Predictable, boring, and very un-thematic.

This just isn't my type of game.  I liked the puzzle aspects, but we spent too much time wondering if we were doing the right thing or just wasting time.  There were 5 of us and it was difficult to see and share the materials.  A few of us got bored and just left the two that were the best at the game take over.  I actually started setting up another game to play next game at one point.

Hard to rate as I will never play again, but it was a fun experience. Suggest to play with 4 people who share the cost of the game, so everyone has about 1-2 hours of fun for 3 € (at the MSRP of 12 € in Germany). So forgoing the BGG scale and rating it an 8.5, as I will definitely go out and get another Exit game, if they make one!

Soo much easier and more cohesive than "The Secret Lab"...damn. This should have been our first experience with the EXIT-Games. But not just for us - for everyone! Would have been nice of KOSMOS to number them (as an indicator which to play first), or at least give stars for the difficulty, e.g. like in the NORIS Cases. We figured out many of these riddles here in 2 minutes or less, really. So: no comparison to the sheer endless combinatorial possibilities of the Lab. Tl;dr: If you're new to the Series or Exit room-Games in general -> definitely get this one first. It's great, although a little easy.

EXIT The Abandoned Cabin is a very entertaining escape room game that plays in about 90 minutes, making it a bit longer than other games of the genre. The game is very well designed and fun. There absolutely no need to cut or damage any of the components, that's just a ripoff to avoid sharing the game.

Really enjoyed solving this tonight. We played it as a 2-player, and I think playing it with more than 3 would be problematic, as the puzzles are fairly linear and you need to share resources. However, we loved the quality of the production, and the puzzles felt quite innovative to us. The mechanics of the game work well, with the answer cards and code wheel making it difficult to cheat and try and force a solution. A much neater mechanic than the Unlock solution, which we have played. Somewhat pricey  for a 2-hour experience, but we will definitely be picking up another Exit game. We were careful not to damage any components, to allow for lending and/or resale.

I loved this game! Played it two player with my mom, and we ended up with 7 stars.

The puzzles in this worked better for me personally than did the puzzles in the Unlock series.

Great game. I do enjoy the real life escape rooms, and i'll have to say that i enjoyed this game even more. Classic theme to this one, which i liked, and the puzzles were fairly challenging for the most part. I enjoyed the mechanic of how you look to check your answers during the game. This is my first escape room game, so i'll have to play more in order to compare it, but what a great experience for the first one. I don't even care that it's a one time play, cause it's a small box, so now i can just trade it around and let someone else try it, and try the next one.

If you want the experience of an escape room game in the comfort of your own home this is about as close as you can get. The theme has a saw-esque feel as you're trapped in a psychopath's cabin and are trying to free yourself. The variety of puzzles is really good and for the most part very cleverly implemented. Be warned this can only be played once as you will be forced to destroy components as you go, however the low price point makes this pretty painless.

This is the 5th Exit game I've played, and I would rank this 4th out of the 5. I'm not sure why it has the highest rating. The puzzles were good as always, but a little dull compared to some of the really clever and memorable ones I've seen in the other games. We zipped through it pretty quickly in 1:12 with no hints. The things we did get stuck on were mostly just stupid little things rather than a huge "aha" moment.

We just tried the teaser edition at the fair in Essen. The quality was surprisingly good for a game, which you can just play once. Nice ideas even if the teaser version was a little bit to easy. We did not use any support card a escaped in less than 18 minutes. But the staff at the both confirmed, that the "real" game will be more complex and not so easy to solve. Therefore, we are curios to find out what happens in the lost cabin!

We enjoyed this very much - very creative puzzles. Some are rather complicated but never to a point where they seem too hard even in hindsight.

Quite nice for such a small package.  Most of the puzzles were pretty straightforward.  There were a few on the tough side, and one that we struggled with a lot.

I really liked my single game play of the game - unfortunately it took us a little bit more than 90 minutes to escape from the cabin with 2 players. You don't really need to tear. cut or write on the material so you could eventually play it again after a couple of years or give it your friends to try the experience again. I like the Escape: the board game series a little bit more with the encoder machine but there are more puzzles in this one it seems. The spinning dial and the book of answer cards is a nice way to resolve the riddles. This one is the best of the EXIT series I've played until now.

I think that Marnaudo is spot on in his video review.  This is not a game, but rather an activity that involves sequentially solving puzzles.  The puzzles are clever...a few are extremely obvious, and a few are frustrating in their lack of contextual clues (meaning you've got to basically try a bunch of random combinations).  The problem is that I'm not someone who likes doing puzzles merely for the sake of doing puzzles.  Never have been.  I don't do Sodukos; never did word scrambles in the newspaper; not even a big fan of crossword puzzles.  That said, I DO have a tremendous appreciation for puzzles and riddles...their cleverness and out-of-the box cognitive requirements.  I just I need my puzzles to be in the service of something else.  Solve the puzzle in order to unlock X.  Figure out the riddle in order to learn about Y.  This "unlocking" is what I found to be missing in The Abandoned Cabin.  You solve a puzzle, draw the appropriate cards, and these cards set up the next puzzle.  Solve that puzzle, draw the appropriate cards, and these cards set up the next puzzle.  Etc.

At first I would have said that what was missing was theme, and yes, the game does a VERY poor job with its theme.  At the very least there should have been Arkham Horror-like "read outs."  "You unlock the armoire and inside amongst the cloths you uncover the following... Draw cards J, Q, and U."  Something as simple as providing such thematic atmosphere would have made the game a bit more interesting to me.  But really, it is not "theme" that is missing so much as meaningful contingencies.

Contingency is a fancy word that simply means causal structure.  So "meaningful contingency" is meaningful causal structure.  Take a safe that is locked with a code.  Why do you need to unlock the safe?  That's the "meaning."  When you do unlock the safe, you find X, and that X is going to have a function.  That's contingency.  The Abandoned Cabin lacks meaningful contingency, which in a sequential puzzle game...unless you SIMPLY like puzzles... is really important.  Otherwise, you are basically creating the game equivalent of a classroom experience in which the teacher is providing you with random homework.  I'd say that MOST of us remember school experiences like this, and MOST of us did not enjoy them.  "Why am I having to do this?  It's a waste of time."

Now, Abandoned Cabin *as a social experience* isn't a waste of time.  Getting together with friends sometimes requires an excuse.  Talking with your kids sometimes requires a distractor.  In that sense, the game could have meaning.  I'd also argue that spending time with puzzles and riddles is an activity that also, probably, practices certain types of cognitive behaviors that could be useful: observation, attentive patience, categorical fluidity, trial-and-error, etc.  We need to be careful with asserting games-as-cognitive-exercise (the only data I know is weak), but hey, at least there is some potential upside compared to, say, spending yet another two hours on social media.  That said, Abandoned the Cabin makes no attempt to control the social experience.  If you are a kid who happens to have a parent that DOESN'T listen to your ideas, then playing this game with your parent is only going to reify that relationship.  Also, talk all you want about "cognitive exercise," that kid isn't going to get any.

So what do I wish Abandoned the Cabin had done?  What do I think would make it a better game?  

1. Roles.  The reason co-ops have roles is that they provide some control over the social experience.  It's weak, and you can still get alpha players, but at least there is the chance that a player's role will make them "important" in the game.  

2. Randomness. I'd argue for randomness as yet another means of moving the spotlight on to different players.  When you just happen to be that player who lucked out, well, that's a way of taking the spotlight, temporarily, from an alpha player.  Making the randomness connected with access to privileged information, and that player becomes even more important.

3. Meaningful Contingency. Really, this is the most important feature that I found to be missing.  #1 and #2 don't matter that much to me, just because I have a pretty good gaming group as far as alpha players, and in most of my games with kids, I'm happy to let them take the lead.  However, whether through story or through more clever puzzle construction, I prefer my puzzles to have in-game functions.  I want to figure out the code for THIS particular safe for THIS particular reason...  Thematically, the safe in the office might have the nuclear codes that I need to diffuse a bomb.  I might not yet know where the bomb is, but I have good reason to believe that the code is in the safe.  (You can see how "meaning" is also connected with "expectation / anticipation.")  Even without a narrative, though, meaningful contingency can still exist.  One puzzle might contain the third element of a puzzle that I KNOW EXISTS, but for which I need five elements before I can start it.  The Abandoned Cabin DID have puzzles that could only be put together after first solving another puzzle.  But there was no set up.  There was no anticipation.  You just set the cards aside and keep going.  Like I said earlier - it felt like a bit like meaningless homework.

Anyway, I wrote a lot more on this game that I had expected to.  I guess it helped clarify some things for me.  For example, I LOVED my first experience with T.I.M.E. Stories, and I guess I now have a better understanding of what I liked about it.  It is essentially a cooperative "puzzle game."  But it has #1 - #3 above.  Also, when I was a kid there was a book that came out entitled Masquerade.  The author / artist had hidden an actual gold rabbit somewhere in the UK.  The book was a set of paintings and riddles which he stated would lead to the gold rabbit.  I loved that book, even if I never had the intrinsic motivational desire to grapple with its puzzles.  Abandoned the Cabin is Masquerade...but without the gold rabbit.

Escaped the Abandon Cabin alone in 95 minutes and 45 seconds.
Zero (0) help cards were used, earning an 8-star assessment.

Enjoyed the puzzles and design of this series - very nicely put together package and worth the price of admission. However, I say that in part because my copy is still in pristine condition and could be re-played, loaned, traded or sold afterwards.

Obviously lacks replay value. Rating represents my willingness to try other games in the Exit series, as this one is essentially "done" for me.

Don't destroy anything while playing. You can easily solve everything while keeping your components intact if you use your head a little bit.

One notable negative: the game suggests between one and six players, but smaller groups are best in my opinion. There aren't enough puzzles active at any given time to keep a larger group busy, so it really feels designed for just one or two people to play at a time.

I love the general conception of cooperative puzzle solving in the Exit games, but I wish it was a bit more tense.

Not only in difficulty, but also in execution - the riddles are not as frustrating as the tomb, but at least one puzzle was more frustrating than the whole lab (mainly because we thought we solved it, only to discover, that there was one card not yet in play which changed the solution). There are more cool ideas than in the lab in perspective of using the box itself, but less than in the  tomb. The immersion of the theme is not as bad as the tomb, but less than the lab. All in all a good middle-ground - definitly better than the tomb, but I liked it less than the Lab.

Wow what a weird and wonderful gaming experience! I know that it's only about an hour to an hour and a half of fun, but for the price point, it's really a great deal. At least two mind blowing moments in this game. I was just floored by its originality. I will be picking up every Exit game from now on, you can count on that.

A game with a lot of riddles. It's not so bad but i miss a strong story (I prefer the game  Unlock). I didn't like also to destroy some card to find solution. It's not a problem for me to destroy equipment on a legacy game because there is a purpose or an evolution. But here, i didn't understand the purpose of destroying.

This was frustratingly difficult at times and other times acts of pure genius. For this being basically a deck of cards, a small pamphlet and a decoder circle, it felt pretty crazy at times.

It's literally a one and done game, so into the recycle it went, but even though we were terrible at it, it was awesome. Looking forward to the other games in the set.

*SPOILER-FREE*
A good escape room experience: there is story, tension and good riddles. Some are a little obvious, but there are more challenging ones as well. There are some surprising out of the box riddles, but no real big plot twists. Something that was a little disappointing is the linearity of the game / story: you can't do a lot of things at the same time (you have to do / get something before you can continue), which makes it better suited for lesser player counts (I wouldn't recommend this with more than four players). The tactile aspect of the game added to the escape room feel, but the small amount of things needed to be destroyed makes you wonder if that was worth it or just a selling trick. Those two negative points didn't decrease the enjoyment of the game, but I would consider them when buying a new one.

I could see enjoying this as an activity with pre-teen kids or working through it solo.  It's not really much of a game, though, as much as it is an activity. 

There was a tendency in our group to over-think many of the "puzzles" so we got off to a relatively slow start, but picked up steam as the "game" went along. For where I am in my life, I don't see playing many more of these.

Played this on my own once. Did not tear or write on anything so still if it as was new. Obviously made it harder/impossible at one or two points in the game but I had no problem with it. I was mostly trying to see if it can be done solo prior to taking it to a friends place.

Possibly the best escape room format, as there is no need for an electronic device as in Escape Room: the Game, and doesn't follow the linear format of Escape the Room from Think Fun.

One-time play. If you want to experience it fully, you will destroy it.

Very creative puzzles that use different techniques. And a wheel that simulates "trying codes on a lockpad". It is puzzle solving AND location awareness, which gives the real escape room experience.

Having really enjoyed the Pharaoh's Tomb, the Abandoned Cabin was up next and, while we did enjoy it, the puzzles didn't feel quite so much in our groove as the previous game. That said, I suppose the "A-ha!" moments were made more satisfying because of it, but whatever terms I use, it wasn't quite as good an experience. Scored 9 stars, though, and still didn't have to destroy anything, so completely reusable.

Is Exit: The Game – The Abandoned Cabin a game at all? I'm tempted to say not - it's essentially a one-use puzzle book. But we had fun and that's the main thing! The card-based system for gradually revealing new puzzles and pieces of the solutions to existing ones is clever, as is the solution-entry disc. On the whole, the puzzles were pretty easy - we finished in a hair over an hour without using any hints - but I've heard others in the series are tougher. I was pleased that it was easy to preserve the components by using a bit of tracing paper - trashing it after one go seems awfully wasteful.

Escape the Room in a box. This was very well done and the puzzles were all solvable in a reasonable time. It's a shame that the game can only be played once as the game components get used up as you play. Some puzzles were really easy and others took a long time and required clue cards. I wish some of the text and explanations were more clear about when you were able to use what. Overall, a solid game and was very well received. Escape room for a $15 price point.

As many wrote this is very nice one from exit series, I liked this one, some riddles were fast and easy, some bit more tricky. Overall one I would suggest to play.
Also you do not have to destroy anything to play it, suggestion: use one of those plastic document sleeve and permanent marker.

We were sitting longer time on one or two riddles.
But more because we are not native English speakers rather than riddles itself.

It is a pretty awesome system. I almost think I like Unlock! better because it is more thematic. That being said the puzzles were very hard and I just don't think I am a puzzle kind of guy. This is a great system, just not really what I necessarily want to do when I play boardgames.

I was hesitant to play this type of game.  I'm not a fan of the legacy craze that has happened lately.  I enjoy replay value in my games.  I want to make an investment for years of fun.

Having said that, this game was superbly enjoyable.  For the money spent, I believe I'd compare it to a night at the movies rather than another game.  Another game, even if it's more expensive, will give much more for much longer.  This, like a movie, will be over quickly and you'll just have a memory.

But what a damn good memory...

At the time this review was published, I have played fourteen escape room scenarios spanning seven different series. Included in that count are my plays of The Abandoned Cabin and The Pharaoh's Tomb in the EXIT: The Game series from KOSMOS. I am happy to report that this series is my favorite so far with Escape Room The Game is a close second. There are many similar games now available and my concern was that they would start feeling the same and repeat puzzles and content. However, the EXIT games definitely put those thoughts to rest for now since they were incredibly engaging, creative, and innovative. They present a fresh approach, different puzzles, and a challenging experience. Overall, there is quite a bit of adventure packed into a small box with minimal components and a really attractive price point. I really look forward to playing The Secret Lab and all of the other upcoming EXIT games. The announcement list of new EXIT games includes another eight and my excitement just keeps growing. The next few months should be another really fun time for escape room games!

Also didn't need to destroy the components, just too a little longer that's all.

The puzzles were good. Some very obvious, some took a little thinking time, and one or two were a little vague, but once we found the answer we could see how it could have been solved.

Inkább szkeptikusan ültem le a játékhoz, nem hittem, hogy a szabadulós játékokat jól meg lehet valósítani asztali játék formájában, de kellemeset csalódtam. Abszolút visszaadja a fizikai kijutós játékok hangulatát, izgalmas, jó és érdekes feladványok vannak benne, amik között vannak meglepőek is, de akik több szabaduló szobát végigcsináltak már azoknak ez is menni fog. Nagyon jól kitaláltak a segítségeket, hogy három szintre bontották minden külön feladathoz őket. Szerintem a 3 fő pont ideális játékosszám volt hozzá. Egyetlen egy dolog nem tetszett, de ez semmiség, a játék pontozása. Van a szabályban egy táblázat, ami a felhasznált idő és segítségek száma alapján 0 és 10 csillag közé értékeli az eredményünket. Egyrészt én mindenképp belevenném a játékosok számát is a csillagok kiszámításába, másrészt adott számú segítség felhasználása után nem adnék egy csillagot se. Nevetséges, hogy ha valaki minden megfejtést megnéz a segítségekről és 15 perc alatt befejezi a játékot, akkor az ugyanúgy 4 csillag, mint aki keményen, időt rászánva 3 segítséggel oldja meg a feladatot. Ezen még dolgozhattak volna, de persze ez nem a játék része, így jár a magas pont az Exit ezen történetére. Kíváncsi vagyok a többire is!

The is the second of a series of 3 Exit games I've played.  The first one I played was The Secret Lab so check out my comments on that game for a full review.

This one specifically was my favorite.  If you don't want to be spoiled as to why then please stop reading now.

The main reason this one is my favorite is that the puzzles I found a little more original while still both challenging and fair.  For example, one particular puzzle required us to actually use an element on the box as a clue.

tl;dr: not a game

Let's be clear: I mostly enjoyed 'playing' this, but I don't consider this a game. In a game you have a number of possible moves and choose which one to take. This is just a multi player puzzle. You have a number of things and you make your best guess as a group and look if you where right. Nope, not a game in my book. But certainly not annoying.
There was one question that had us stuck for quite a while. We used the tips, but the first tip didn't add any new info, and the second one only a tiny bit. We also used 2 other tips on other problems, but those also didn't help as they always gave us info we already knew.
In any case: if you like solving puzzles as a group, give it a try. But don't expect a proper board game, not even a proper co-op.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 1/10 as it defies the description of a game. And I will never play (this version) of the game ever again as there is zero replay value. But it is not awful as the BGG scale for 1/10 indicates.

This is a hard game to rate, given that I never want to play again (hell, never can, unless I get amnesia).  I did enjoy it for the one session, and it very cleverly recreates the experience of being in an escape room.  But... I'd much rather do an escape room.

RATING: 7
It's a fun experience, I'm just not sure it's worth the cost.

I've played Escape Room The Game and the demo scenario for Unlock. I put this on par with Escape Room the Game, and I didn't like Unlock so I consider this to be better. I played this with four players and it would probably be better with three. Typically you deal with one puzzle at a time, so it becomes impractical to have four people all trying to do the same thing. This was one advantage of Escape Room the Game: you usually got several pieces of information up front, so you could distribute it to the different players to analyze at the same time.

I'm just not sure how many more of these I'll enjoy playing, especially for the high cost for a one-time experience. This is basically a $12 deck of cards that you'll throw away after your 60-90 minute game, or possibly resell for a few bucks if you manage to work around any destructive elements.

Fun to try if you're in the mood for something different, but after finishing the other escape-room-in-a-box games that I have I think I'll be done with the format for a while. Despite having different settings and different types of puzzles, they do start to feel samey after a while.

***SPOILERS AHEAD***

The Abandoned Cabin felt like a good place to start with the EXIT series. The only previous escape room game I had played was an Unlock entry and I had a feeling EXIT was structured a bit differently.

There were several creative puzzles here, including tracing a word on a mix of letters to form the shape of a number. The fourth-wall-breaking puzzles were slick too, digging under the insert and checking the box's UPC. Very creative stuff!

I enjoy puzzles. Some of the puzzles weren't that bad, but to make a "game" by stringing puzzle after puzzle together didn't' work for me. Personally, I didn't mind working through the puzzles solo. I do not feel it works with more players. We played EXIT with 5 people and it divided the group into some that pushed to finish (just to finish, not for the fun of it) and some who were either lost or didn't care.

We are fans of escape rooms but the table top exit games are a different beast all together. There are many aspects of the tabletop series we enjoyed. First, it restricts the scope of the investigation unlike in escape rooms. If the clues are poorly constructed, escape rooms can be a chore because the logic and sequence of puzzle solving is not really intuitive. In Abandoned cabin, the clues are a bit more linear and you know which to solve first before moving on to the next set. Some of the puzzles are indeed quite fun and outside the box. I love the challenge. The puzzles are mid-range. Some are easier and some are quite clever. Overall, we finished the puzzled feeling satisfied. That is certainly more than I can ask for.

Essentially, the exit room games is a cooperative puzzle solving game that can be played only once. I do have an issue with tossing out the game not in terms of replayability, but in terms of waste. I should be repurposed for something else.

What a great implementation of an Escape Room-in-a-box. My group really enjoyed our play through. Challenging puzzles and quality components (that you then destroy.) $14 USD to entertain five adults for 84 minutes was well worth it. Would give this a 10 if it was re-playable (could pass it along to another group) and if the puzzles were more connected to each other in theme. Those small things aside, it was a hit!

An excellent experience for a low price point. I may have only been able to play it one time, but me and 5 friends had a lot of fun playing it for a few hours. Looking forward to playing more of these.

Some fun puzzles. Other puzzles are very obscure to figure out.  Often you feel lost on what to do next.

Excellent escape room game. Focus is on many 10+ shorter puzzles. However, there is a fairly narrow chance this is solvable in under an hour even if you never get stuck. There is a lot of bang for buck in this.
Overall EXIT is probably the best escape room series when comparing to Escape room: The game, Escape the room and Unlock! series.

played the PnP (theater) - pretty cool, the PnP is not as good as Unlock, but it's promising; will buy the games as they come out in French

some interesting puzzles, one puzzle was frustrating because you "think" you can solve it at some point but you are in fact missing one piece of information that changes the result (counting the statues, before opening closet)

Excellent escape room style boardgame; taking into account only the puzzles, it is leaps and bounds better than its competition. Another solid entry in the series, even if not outstanding like "The Pharaoh's Tomb".

Successfully replicates escape room experience. Otherwise I'm not too fond about the single use games.

Played with five players. Playing time was 45 minutes with three hints used.

Great puzzle, I was amazed by how close the feeling of this game was to the real escape room. It's a perfect game for couples, you will have a fantastic evening with Exit. The riddles are clever and require a lot of creative thinking. Loved every single minute of this game.

The downside is that it's one-time use only, but the good news is that you can finish the whole thing and reset it to its original state without destroying any of the components and then simply resell it.

This series of one-shot escape games provide a similar kind of puzzle solving as seen with real escape rooms and are very creative in their puzzles.  There's not enough here to justify the full player count though; 2 or maybe 3 players is enough. I would recommend that they are played in the following order: Abandoned Cabin, Secret Lab, and then Pharaoh's Tomb.

(Spoiler free)
Having enjoyed the experience of an escape room I was intrigued as to how something like this would compare (because for me a large part of the experience was actually being trapped in a room).
I was pleasantly surprised. While the real deal was superior it is also way more expensive. The puzzle aspects here were very engaging and apart from getting stuck once and being stubborn for nearly 1 hour and not looking at the solution, the rest of it was indeed a lot of fun. The whole working together and solving stuff was as fun as an escape room. I also felt the game did a decent job of making you feel you were trapped inside a room by way of descriptions and pictures.
I worry about one aspect though. In the end, the group did look at that one solution and none of us could see how you could come up with that solution from the info/clue given. It kind of spoiled things for us. We all felt that when you discover the solution to something, you should immediately go "I see, I get it now" and have a kind of kick yourself moment. That wasn't how anyone felt after reading the solution. It really did feel like you had to take a leap of faith to check the decoder if said solution was correct. That experience may or may not prevent us from trying another of these otherwise intriguing and engaging puzzles.

On a final note, The idea of it being throw-away and still being a cheap experience I feel is not entirely accurate. Many board games I own will give hundreds of hours of fun and are more engaging than this (imo obviously) meaning that they are even better value than playing an Exit game once. It is still cheap when compared to say, for example. four people going to the cinema, but it's all relative so compared to many other board games it offers less value.
That being said, I don't feel it would spoil the experience much at all to play this without cutting and only writing in light pencil so I can see that maybe in a couple of years time you could play it again and have forgotten how to do it.

This was my first time playing an Exit game and I must say I'm impressed. I love escape rooms and this replicated the feeling of one in my bedroom! It's a shame it's one use only, but compared to an actual escape room, it's a steal. Highly recommended!

A really enjoyable one and done experience. I would be up for trying another one of these. I was glad that each of us contributed, it was my fear I'd be left drooling whilst others "got it" but we were all able to access this and we solved all the puzzles.

There's actually something cathartic about a game you play once, enjoy it, and then chuck it in the bin.

This type of puzzle is the kind of stuff I enjoyed as a kid so I believe would make a great family activity. Our group of adults had trouble understanding the rules of the game so we were already sunk. I have a strong dislike of point & click video games and this felt similar to me.

Played with my brother, his wife, and my wife. We beat it with a six-star rating. This puzzle was very satisfying--I prefer it to the three Unlock! games I've tried. However, I don't like the destructible nature of the game, since I can't give it away or sell it afterward.

A very fun, puzzly and engaging experience. The puzzles vary in difficulty but none reach the level of being frustatingly difficult. There's a couple of genuine wow moments in the game which brought smiles to our faces and admiration of how clever they were. The one-and-done nature of these games is a little hard to get over, but this 1 play has definitely made me keen to try others in the series.

Einmal-Spiel mit einer Menge Rätseln, die man innerhalb von etwa einer Stunde schaffen kann. Hat Spaß gemacht, auch wenn einiges ziemlich leicht war. Am besten alleine oder zu zweit spielen, mit mehr Leuten kommt man sich denke ich nur in die Quere.

RATING: 8
The game looks awesome with top notch components. 
Kudos to Hexasim.
The game feels very deep with accurate diplomatic options and a lot of spaces for military campaign with a limited number of corps. 
The battle system looks "napoleonic", complete and original.

What I don't like: 
*the rules look a bit inaccurate, something could be worded better (controlled vs "free to all" zone for example).
*the example of play
*the single round to move from Alexandretta to Egypt
*the fleets at sea during winter

Based on a solo playthrough of the 1805-1814 campaign game.  I quite enjoyed the game, I think it captures the period effectively, I would recommend it, I do intend to play the 1809-1814 campaign game at some point, and I still can't get over how gorgeous the map and counters are. That said, there were a few frustrations... The rules are solid but the rulebook makes them seem harder than they actually are (the example of play was excellent and I found it necessary to learn the game). Some of the cards weren't entirely clear as to their effect, and some card text conflicted with the text of the play aid that had explanations of what certain cards did. The diplomatic model is a little odd, with no possibility of peace or territory changing unless a nation is defeated. This led to a situation where although Napoleon couldn't finish off Russia, he actually crippled it worse by NOT defeating it but instead leaving a good chunk of it occupied. Finally, there was the usual CDG/CDW issue where large portions of the map (e.g. Spain) didn't do anything because cards were being spent to activate forces elsewhere.

Oh well. I was looking forward to try it. I like CDGs and this one, with areas, looked intriguing. Scale seemed right, not too many counters, excellent production.

However it didn't work for me. Here's why.

1) Production is quite good, no doubt about it. My only reservation is with the map, area names in grey are not much legible, area boundaries are not very clear and confusing. I feel the map lacks functionality for instance to show political alignment, special cases etc. Pretty but not friendly enough.

2) Some people complaint that rules are not well written and confusing. In French at least it is not so bad but yes, the wording could be a bit tighter, consistent and better organized. No big rules problem but there are some issues with when to use Tactical Defensive vs. Tactical Offensive ratings for leaders in various checks DRMs for example.

3) The rules system/mechanics is where "le bât blesse", where it hurts the most. They used a tried and true CGD system and slapped on top of it an unnecessary number of steps, checks, DRMs which make the game tedious and sometimes counter-intuitive. Impossible to conduct a move without referring to rules and/or charts, and to look at several places in the rulebook in the process. The system should have been streamlined considerably, supply rules could be much simpler (why fixed and mobile depots? Area control would have done it), cut down on the number of checks + modifiers by using more integrated/inventive mechanics. Another example is the Political system. An impossibly long diplomacy chart, with all sorts of exceptions and particularities, probably all valid from an historical standpoint but not well rendered in a game format. The design should have been cleaned up.

4) The above leads to more work and less fun. We spent the better part of our Saturday at Carnage to go through 2 turns. I'm all for involved games with steep learning curve but this one felt like the equation of effort/fun not very positive.

5) To add insult to injury, I felt that the game was pretty much scripted. Nappy goes against Austria like a knife through butter (or like a Panzer army), then goes after Prussia. Why even try to contest England on the seas? Coalition waits its time to retaliate. I see very little variation to this scenario. It may be historical, but is it fun? And how much effort/work is required to get there?

I don't have whole weekends to spend gaming the obvious without having fun in the process...

RATING: 10
This is a tentative rating.  One should look to those who have played it more in order to get a better feel for the game.  And any set of translated rules will bring its own set of problems.  Good grief, rules written with English as the first language, such as Crown of Roses, make the rules in this game look crystal clear.

Based on 2 solo campaigns.

Okay, on "round 3" of his attempts to do Napoleonic Strat, Stanislaus gets it mostly right here. The subject is a tall order, to be sure; I have been working independently on my own Napoleonic strat for 6 years, and finally broke down to buy this because I got tired of working mine, and thought I'd check this out.

And I'm glad I did.  Here, the designer has reeled in and focused his Nap scale and vision to create a solid, often impressive, and, finally -- most important --  manageable single map Nap strat game, that has just enough color and detail.  I found to my very pleasant surprise that he'd handled a lot of the strategic/diplomatic wrinkles and quandries with the same mechanisms I'd used in my development.  In several areas, his ideas and subsystems are better.  His armies are suitably differentiated by counter values and combat cards, French army quality degradation is handled in elegant fashion, the naval aspect isn't over done, and the knotty problem of Spain is handled at least adequately, without 3 pages of its own rules.  Bravo!  

The game's a ways from perfect, with several unavoidable ambiguities and minor rules holes, but I'd expect that trying to cover a subject this big.  I can easily fold in a few house rules and tweaks, and play this game as my Go To Nap strat -- and I can retire from trying to push my game out the door myself, and just PLAY this one.  Hooray, Stanislaus!  Double Bravo!!  (now, will someone design a good Austrian Succession strat, so I don't have to try to get Clash of Sovereigns across the finish line? ? ) :emoticon smile:

This is not a very good game. After buying and appreciating Hexasim's WW2 title, "Liberty Roads", I had hopes for NaE, but it's simply not a well thought through game. It seems to me this game would have needed a lot more play testing before release.

RATING: 6
Components are beautiful for this one. Rules, even 2nd edition, are not well presented, and leave a fair number of ambiguities and questions. Add to that the glossy stock they're written on, and you can't even pencil in changes. There are also some counter misprints - which I don't believe were caught for the 2nd Edition.

Gameplay suffers from some fairly common CDG problems: events are often not worth playing as events (so they likely don't happen), and the focus of activity for a turn eats up ALL the resources for that turn. These combine to degrade any historical quality that the game may present. This does produce what feels like a hard-choices competitive flavor - but the rules weaknesses probably preclude it being a competitive gamer's favorite.

More detail than Napoleonic Wars - but given the flaws (which show even without exposing the game to serious sharks), I would say less historically accurate. But yeah, it's pretty.

Pros: The lovely components are a real joy to look at and play with, the Age of Napoleon inspired design captures the theme and key decisions of the era quite well, and the game can really develop in tension once the Punishment era hits giving the Coalition access to better command and cards.  I also generally liked how diplomacy and the Peninsular War are handled.

Cons: While very playable the production and game system have several nuisances that drag on the play and overall enjoyment of it.   The rule book and cards needed better translation, more rigid structuring, detailing, and elimination of sloppy errors that should have been corrected in the 2nd edition.  During play this often leads to constant referencing of several player aids (that probably should have have been bound together in a separate player's guide and a simple rewrite of certain cards).   Some of the cards are very situational while others can have an over-powering effect on final victory conditions.  The French player has to play certain cards in order to win and it is possible the Coalition can get lucky with the Malet or Metternich events by forcing a discard of a vital card that likely won't be recoverable in the Punishment era.    Victory Conditions follow a VP scoring track, but if there is no sudden victory, the conditions are then based on control of certain French key zones.  As noted by Calandale, this may lead to French turtling in the late war to protect a victory that seems a bit odd in terms of historical feel.  Not saying these conditions are completely false or unrealistic, but it made me wonder if a better system could have been designed for competitive scoring (perhaps like Herman's strategic will track in For the People) or something where the final status of the army strength was also considered.  Partly this goes back to the difficulty of designing a Napoleonic game that accounts for the decision of whether or not to undertake an invasion of Russia and how to account for other factors that eventually led to Nappy's downfall.  

Overall:  I think 7 is fair for this game.  In the Game Design notes, the designer compares this to Herman's For the People, and while in some sense I agree, I actually felt the design more closely resembles Age of Napoleon but with more overall complexity.   Despite my complaints I actually like this one even if it comes up short of being great.  As far as who else will like it, I think some will be able to look beyond its faults and find great enjoyment from the good aspects while others will give up on it.  Hard to say.

I'm wathcing Calandale's review  of this: most entertaining, but I think he's not using the 2nd edition of the rules. he is right though; the rules are intuitive but not well-written (possibly a problem of translation; I note one or two strange choices of wording by Charles Vasey).

Gorgeous components, maddeningly vague rules, fun system, but terribly imbalanced situation where it is no fun to be the Coalition.  France as usual has no incentive to invade Russia so the Coalition never gets its historical licks after years of losing every battle.  Great game on a terrible situation.  Not a good subject for a strategic game.

I would rate this game a 10 if you get to play France, and a 3 if you have to play the Coalition. :-D

RATING: 6
Goddammit. Goddammit all. Why do companies keep doing this to us, why? The tears are pricking at my eyes right now, the dull ache of frustation is wearing away at my soul.

There's a cracking game in here, there really really is. Unfortunately it's hidden being an absolute f*cking monstrosity of a rulebook that almost-but-not-quite gives the required information in an almost-but-not-quite-timely manner.

The components are really, really lovely quality although a bit small for my piggy myopic squint these days, but then that's my problem. Like a well-cooked meat, the chits almost fell off their supports, and I hadn't even thought of the word 'clipping' until just now. The boards are very nicely done, with lots of space for all the relevant information and army boxes. The cards are lovely quality, and the rulebook is of an excellent print quality.

But...

The translation from the original French to English is adequate but not great - the subtle nuances of one language have been lost in the transfer to another, and with it the implicit meaning of a lot of the rules. It would be as if No Retreat used the terms 'counterblow' and 'counterattack' interchangeably, despite being two different concepts. Some mechanics are a bit tacked on - the siege system springs to mind as being needlessly complex.

I'm really tired of this sort of thing now - by all means, let's get more games from different countries but for God's sake, let's get them translated properly. Like a rerun of 'Allo Allo,' it's just not entertaining anymore - just tired, sad men dressed as women and using those 'seellee Frrrrennch accccennnntsss' and trying to explain rules to me that weren't written for me.

I shouldn't have to be coming onto BGG and other sites to be finding interpretations of the rules for my game - I should be playing and enjoying my game.

Very favorable first impressions. Game flows smoothly, is evocative of the period, and faces the player with difficult decisions at every turn. Even as the French player in 1805 you will be agonizing at every move. The French can win battles, but there are many ways to lose troops, and time is always short!

The French player needs to be very aggressive and adventurous if they want to keep up the historical pace that Napoleon did. The cards make this hard to do, but overall an interesting game system I wouldn't mind trying again.

Grand card-driven nappy strategic.
The game itself is pretty good, even if there are some minor, inevitable mistakes. Components are gorgeous and the historical accuracy is more or less here. The system is quite cumbersome - not difficult, just tedious to constantly check lot of datas.
I'm highly HIGHLY disappointed though, by the fact that the 2.0 version of the rules are only updated in FRENCH, while the english ones are still 1.0, and we're talking about 2 years ago.

Eight hour CDG of the Napoleonic Wars with corps and army commanders, area movement and year long turns of 4-5 rounds. Victory is based on VPs, won for conquest and playing certain events, if neither side wins the French win by controlling France and Mantua. Like other Napoleonic strategy games it suffers in that no sane French player will invade Russia. Therefore the game depends on the French campaign in Spain, which can become quite intricate, and whether the Allies can get Austria, Prussia and Russia into the war all at the same time. The result is rather like Age of Napoleon, but the manoeuvring of the armies is more detailed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I must say this is a very important game for everyone fond of Napoleonic period. It is one of the best and serious games that permit to remake all the napoleonic wars at a grand strategic level.
The rules get many features from all the other games of the same kind: land combat and supply are coming from AH's "War & Peace", the interphase and card rules are very similar to "The Napoleonic Wars", reduction and counters features are coming from "Age of Napoleon", some other details come from "Soldier Emperor" and "Empires in Arms"...it is a complete compendium of what a complex Napoleonic game should be.

The rules aren't too hard and I like very much the activation system, diplomatic stuff and the way cards are gained. The combat system is nice and interesting, but still too depending from the dice result (you may have lots of bonuses due to elite corps or grreat generals, but if the dice result is not good you just lose badly the battle).
What I don't like that much is that the geography in the map is very confusing. It is not easy to understand all boundaries of all minor nations and the various terrains are not clearly visible. Too many symbols and words crowd the map, names of nations, names of cities, names of regions: a mess.
The victory conditions are not intuitive at all, it is required a special study just to understand which are the right actions to do to win.   
Apart from these odd points the game is great and deserves to be bought and played.

Original printing was a bit of a mess, but version 2 of the rules fixed the vast majority of the issues. Still, it needs work to be understood and some of the play aids aren't very good (the one on the Iberian peninsula in particular is poor).
Could have done with a really good development pass before release.

Under all of this is an enjoyable game with options for both sides. Battles are fluid and generate the 'Napoleonic feel'. It's a bit long, taking about 2 days to play to conclusion, the first day of which will involve Napoleon doing whatever he wants to whoever he likes!

All in all it's good but long winded. Some of the cards are a bit too powerful. Oh and my pet peeve - it's too hared to conquer the UK (she only surrenders if the occupying army is in supply at the end of the turn, which is *almost* impossible to achieve) ignore this condition though and it works nicely.

An Excellent game 

Rules critiques are matters of omission more than anything - with reasonable 'non-gamey' consideration all can be resolved.

-------------
Plays fast. After a couple of plays one can get through a turn in an hour or so, even shorter.

Do you know For The People? Imagine this as an adaptation of that system.

-------------

Scoring - 1.0 points off for the rules for matters of omission.

Hats off to Stuka Joe's videos on Youtube.

0.5 off for the tiny tiny print on the counters. Hard to see the attack/defense ratings - but they sort of made up for that by having contrasting oval backgrounds to the numbers.

Counters, boards and cards are very nice overall - impressive production quality.

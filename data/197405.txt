This is in fact an exceedingly smart abstract game with the feeling of a classic. The rules are quite simple, the winning conditions easy to explain. But play is deeply satisfying and smart. You can plan ahead, you can 'check' players into plays, you can play a long game or a quick game. The better player will win and repeated plays will allow you to learn more and more smart plays. Just really great.

Tak is a really good abstract game (and that's coming from a guy who doesn't generally like abstract games).  This is probably helped by the fact that it was inspired by my favorite game series (Kingkiller Chronicle) and the set that I own was handmade for me by my father-in-law.

RATING: 10
It's like chess meets checkers meets tic tac toe meets go. It's a strategy game that's easy to learn and difficult to master. The board is modular, in that you can play on a grid of 4x4, 5x5 or 6x6, all with one board (using either the grid squares or corners).

It's an easy game to make custom sets for, too. I bought the game through Kickstarter, then I had my leatherworker of an uncle make me a custom leather board. I made myself a portable 'board,' too, by cutting a square of linen and drawing a grid on it with a Sharpie. I just folded that up and keep it in my bag of Tak pieces, which makes the game incredibly portable.

Anyway, this game is awesome. The official set comes with a cardboard board, wooden pieces, and a rule book. Everything you'd need. Be warned, though, you'll probably get the itch to make your own set. The Tak subreddit has dozens of examples of custom pieces people have carved or sculpted.

Really enjoyed the the layers this game adds, allowing for a base game that's enjoyable on it's own, with additional rules/modules added to make it more complex when you're ready for the next challenge. Main issue with this game is how expensive it is, but I think it's going to make for a fun woodworking project in the near future.

I enjoy this game as an abstract game. It is easy to teach (even to non-gamers), plays fast, and can be scaled in complexity by size. I purchased the retail set and have been very disappointed in the component quality. The wood feels very light weight and the board is flimsy. I would say that it is fun, but overpriced.

I'm thinking of making my own Tak set. I would buy it but the price is awfully high for the game.

Tak is one of those games where you can play it 100 times and only have found a small fraction of the possible strategies. It's an abstract game with 2 types of game pieces where you're trying to connect one end of a grid-based board to the opposite end. I have fun just figuring out new ways to play. And if you're a fan of the Kingkiller Chronicle series, you will love this game. It doesn't get a 10 because the 3x3 board plays too much in favor of the first player, and the retail base version costs a bit too much (even though it's worth it if you're a fan of the books).

Easy to learn, but you'll soon find out there is a lot of strategy involved once you begin playing.

Tak: A Beautiful Game
MFG: Cheapass Games
#of Players:  2
Age Range: 12+
Overall Construction: The board is one solid piece with a different theme on either side. The pieces are solid wood and of various shapes that seem like they are fit for the long haul. The rulebook gives variations for multiple board sizes. 
The downside is that the board is not well suited for all of the variations of gameplay. The rulebook gives you options for multiple board sizes (from 3x3 up to 8x8), the board only goes up to 5x5 and 4x4 play is a little difficult. I realize that it was made this way to reflect the board from the book this game is based on.
Gameplay: This is a 2 player strategy game. I would vaguely liken it to tic-tac-toe and connect four. Each player has 2 types of pieces depending on the size of the board. 3x3 & 4x4 do not use the Capstone piece.
The object is to make a line from one side of the board to the other. You cannot go diagonally, only in an “L” shape if your straight line is blocked. You are allowed to stack on top of each other. Your basic pieces can be played in one of two ways. Flat which is the way they need to be to count as part of your path. They can also be placed upright, to form a wall. Flats can be stacked onto, walls cannot. Walls do not count as part of your path for winning purposes.
Yes/No Recommend: I will say that I was a little disappointed with this game. Admittedly, over the 25+ years I have been playing board games it takes something special about a game to really WOW! Me, but this game just doesn’t have it. I had to read the rulebook a couple of times to get all of the nuances and still ended up contacting Cheapass with questions. I admit that I did find the answer I was looking for in the rule book before they were able to get with me. For me, if I want to play a strategy game, there are so many other games I would play first, but if you like simple strategy, are a fan of Cheapass Games, or a fan of the book that this game comes from, pick up a copy.
Here is what the game needs to win me over: Be a Cheapass Game or go big. By this I mean, one of the things that drew me to Cheapass Games was the black and white simplicity of their games. They recommended that you steal tokens and other pieces from other games, often only providing rules and the gameboard itself. I think the pieces they provide are of a quality befitting them. To be a Cheapass game and to make the game more playable in all of its variations they should start off with a basic 3x3 board with  “L” shaped board expansions to achieve the other sizes (example: a 3x4 L to put on any side of the board to make it a 4x4 board and so on.
To Go Big: As the name implies, it is supposed to be A Beautiful Game. To do this add velvet bags to keep the game pieces in. Another thing is the board. As it currently exists, it is a single slab of cardboard. It is well done for what it needs to be, but the lines dividing the different segments could be more defined and if need be add a second board that makes the even number of spaces easier to play. I would be ok if the made it on a multi-fold board to get the size boards that the rules cover. 
Where To Get It: This game is fairly new, but to date, ordering it through your local game store or online may be the only way to get it. Please check out their website for more information about this game and other Cheapass Games visit their website here http://cheapass.com/tak/

Great abstract game that's easy to teach, quick to setup and plays very well. The goal is to build a road to the other side of the board by bringing new pieces in and modifying stacks of pieces in a Mancala-ish way. Two other pieces (walls and capstone) disrupt this.

I'm glad they released the beta rules and motivated everyone to assemble their own version despite their kickstarter campaign. Players have been creating really inspire set. I also made my own portable version and am very glad of how it turned out.

Backed on Kickstarter. I'm a fan of the Kingkiller Chronicles and I like all kinds of games. I don't really have an abstract that I really like so this seemed like a natural fit for me.

Update, I have finally received the KS and been able to play a hand of games. Overall, the game plays quickly and doesn't get too bogged down like chess. The options and potential tactics seem quite high so far. I was surprised how much I actually enjoyed playing and how each game evolved quite differently. If you enjoy 2 player abstracts, it is simple to buy this. Even if you don't and you want to try one out, I can safely say that Tak is great game. The price may be a little bit high, but when compared to handcrafted wooden chess sets its not that bad. 

I want to try out a big 8x8 game as I have only had the chance to play 4x4 and 5x5 so far.

Tak is such a brilliant game.  When non-gamers ask me what the game is like, I describe it as having the simplicity of Connect-4 but the strategy of Chess.  I really enjoy the different variations of board sizes and the fact it can be played without a board at all!  I really enjoy portable games as my wife and I like to travel or spend time at the brewery or winery or whatever and play games.  This one is great because it can be played outside on almost any surface and the pieces won't blow away in a breeze.  I am also biased in favor of this game because it was a fictional game based on my favorite author, Patrick Rothfuss.

I'm conflicted. The game is interesting and deep, and I love this type of abstract. But so far, in most of my games I feel stupid because I missed playing a move that would have won or I lose because I missed an obvious connection. I like games where you get outfoxed. But I'm not liking this game where the end sneaks up on you.  Perhaps that is just inexperience or maybe an artifact of playing online. We'll see if my rating goes up.

My KS came in and I've only been able to play 5-6 games with SO. She's not happy that I win kind of easily at it, but hopefully we can get some more in. I need to introduce it to others soon. 

Classic Set has very nice pieces, good feel, nice weight. The board is a little thin and mine was very crooked (Cheapass said they would send me a new one, though).

Tavern Set hasn't been played yet but I love the lightweight feel and size of pieces. A lovely bag with great drawstring action.

Coin is heavy and perfect as a centerpiece.

The Companion Book is simply wonderful. Full of deep insight into the game itself, as well as fascinating fictional lore, including antecedents and game lingo.

Absolutely blown away by this one.

I've played this with my 18yo and my 11yo; both learned the rules quickly.  With the 11yo, I introduced the rules in several stages: a first 4x4 game where we could only lay pieces flat or move them; then a second 4x4 game where we could  place and move standing stones; then a third 4x4 game where we could create and use stacks; then a larger game with the same rules; and finally introducing the capstone.

I'm really drawn to the depth of play available in the simple rules.  Games shift quickly, which keeps them feeling lively; there are always surprises, and you can't get too complacent even when you feel you're winning.  I'm honestly in awe of how rich the gameplay can be for such a simple abstract game.

I was lucky enough to pick up one of the kickstarter Devi's Boxes, and physically it's absolutely luscious: can still smell the woodstain, and appreciate the careful placement of grain and wood selection on the playing surfaces.  I've found that while playing I'm often juggling my in-hand playing pieces while thinking, as they're just a delight to use.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Initial Impressions: I am generally pretty terrible at understanding abstracts, so take my rating with a large grain of salt. This seems to be a surprisingly decent abstract even when not considering it was made to milk off a great book series. There might be slightly more rules and exceptions than most abstracts but it is still easier to learn than other game genres. The ability to control your opponent's pieces, to block with walls (but not win with them), and ability to convert walls to flat pieces with your special piece means you could probably focus more on one aspect over another, and therefore might means you can win in different ways. I also speculate that the size of the board you play on will have a different feel beyond just a longer or shorter game, as on a smaller board your special piece can access the whole board faster, and so putting up walls is less of a permanent maneuver. I don't know if it deserves to be #21 of abstract games as it is currently ranked, but don't be put off by the fact it originated from a book.

I'm starting at a tentative 7. Deceptively simple, yet allows you to play a long game, including using feints.

Tak is a marvel of abstract strategy. I've been actively searching out these kinds of games for me and my friend to play, and we've gone through a lot of them. And many of them we've enjoyed thoroughly! I can honestly say, though, that none of them come remotely close to hitting that beautiful sweet spot of tight gameplay mechanics, balanced movement, suspenseful moments, depth of thought, and short (enough) play time like Tak does. We can take this to a bar, sit outside, generate conversation, and play through a game in 15 minutes to an hour.

The true genius of Tak is in the stacking. You've placed some pieces, your opponent's placed some pieces, and then you take your piece and you move it on top of your opponent's piece...and that's when the true depth of this game starts to become apparent. And it multiplies from there; the improvisational nature of movement when you're controlling a large stack of pieces is unlike anything I've experienced in an abstract before. The rules remain steadfast but the strategic canvas widens and you realize the insane amount of configurations and options available to you, both to advance your position and to impede your opponent's. 

And yet, with all of this talk of depth and complexity, Tak never loses touch with its elegance. Even in the endgame as you scan the board and scramble for options, the choices are always within your brain's reach. It never grows so convoluted as to snuff out the fun. In my experience playing abstracts, this kind of balance is an incredibly difficult thing to design, and Ernest has just nailed it with this one. I can absolutely see Tak becoming a bonafide classic in due time.

This is actually a pretty neat game. Rules are pretty straightforward, but it's feeling pretty crunchy. My only regret is that stacking physical pieces does not lend itself well to Tabletop Simulator so harder to play regularly with out-of-town friends.

The best abstract I have ever played.  I played chess competitively for well over a decade.  I had dozens of books and hundreds of hours of studying.  I simply burned out on it.  Chess seemed more dependent upon memory than any actual tactics.  I was glad to leave the slave grind of that game.  I've tried a lot of great abstracts, but they all just "feel" wrong to me.  Hive, Yinsh, etc.  Great idea, but just leave me unsatisfied.  Tak is a game I wanted to dislike.  Born from a fantasy novel?  Ugh.  But, it works.  It works beautifully.  It's far from a gimmick.  It's simply fantastic.  The game's difficulty scales well based on the size of board you play.  You don't even need to buy the game...you can make your own pieces out of anything.  Nuts and bolts works.  And a board is nice, but again not required.  Just a brilliant design with many levels of depth.  I love it.  Solid 10.

I cannot say enough good things about this game. If you've played, then you don't need convincing- if you haven't played, you need to learn.
Tak is a mirror we hold to the movings of a mind- it can be played as thunderously as an orchestra, or as subtly as ripples across the surface of a pond.
If you enjoy Go, you'll love Tak.

RATING: 8
As the rules suggest, 4x4 (which doesn't include capstones) is a good way to learn Tak. After two plays, we switched to 5x5 (with capstone) for a third, and that's when the rubber really meets the road. There's a lot of depth in Tak, and it's definitely not all evident to me yet as a player.

Alongside the lovely pieces and the simplicity of the game, the thing I like most is how -- like Hive, my favorite game -- it becomes asymmetric through play not just by way of "lost" (covered, etc.) pieces, but through the players' choices to play vs. move. It feels like a multifaceted tug of war that builds until one player or the other has an insurmountable position.

I'm looking forward to playing more Tak.

Pros: Like the attempt at a classical game. Enjoyed the book.

Cons: Very expensive for what you get in the box (number and complexity of pieces, board). The play just isn't that interesting... a lot of repeat back and forth (given the unlimited stack height) that makes it feel like the game is not really progressing. Even on 3x3 our games lasted dozens of moves, and I shudder to think how long a well-played game would last on a 6x6 board. Constant threats of victory, with few ways to counter (at least on small boards), made the decisions extremely short-term / tactical with few (non-losing) choices available. The rules also lack cleanliness (e.g. number of pieces by board size, keystone only on larger boards, etc).

Tak, simply put, is a chess killer for me. And that's not something I say lightly. The ultra low learning curve combined with the depth of its strategy create a game with extreme staying power. The portability and variable board sizes are bonuses that, for me, justify the bump from an 8 rating up to a 9.

I would always play this if someone asked.  To me, it has the depth of something like Chess, but the games go much quicker and it's easier to get in to for someone that has never played it before.

UPDATE: Moved from 9 to 10 after a few dozen plays.

I’m rather surprised (and pleased) to say that Tak lives up to the pre-release hype. It’s not easy to design a good combinatorial abstract, much less a great one. So while I like James Ernest, I wasn’t sure he could pull this off. But, as others have said, this is an ancient game with a long history that was just invented a few months ago. 

The game has a surprising amount of things to consider each move, and it’s very challenging figuring out the best option between placing, moving, stacking, and unwinding stacks. And then there’s the strategy of when to place walls and your capstone. 

Innovative gameplay, great pieces (that can be uniquely designed as long as they can stack and stand on end), and a wonderfully rich back story. Give it a try!

I was doubtful about this game as I'm distrustful of hype. Also, upon reading the rules, I found it less elegant or original that other abstracts.

It combines several mechanisms like a Kris Burm game. This is the part I found a bit inelegant, but it's necessary to add a great amount of complexity in such a small footprint, which I find impressive.

Games don't seem to converge quickly; endgames seem to drag.

I am not normally a fan of 2 player abstracts, but this one is both delightfully weird and yet has lots of short term goals that keep the state space manageable.

I wonder if after enough plays the game will simplify and only a few strategies will seem viable.  So far, I haven't seen that, so maybe it will remain awesome!

update: with more plays the game is still interesting but much less distinctive from other connection games

Tak really is an instant classic. The elegance and simplicity of the rules is remarkable, and yet the depth of strategy is incredible. This game really does feel like it is thousands of years old already, with a weight of history behind it. My father and I made a Tak set when I recieved my Companion Book in the mail (and by the way, if you haven't had a chance to read the Companion Book, I highly recommend that you do so. The 'history' of the game is entertaining, as are the insights into the game's creation), and as soon as the pieces were sanded I started setting up games.

My brother and I have enjoyed sitting down and puzzling out moves together, and despite how much time we've put into it, neither of us have quite figured out what a 'good' move is yet. It's wonderful to encounter a game that challenges us the way Tak does, especially one that does away with all of the extra bells and whistles that most modern games include to try and add variety or depth.

It really is a beautiful game.

I've only played about ten or twenty games since my kickstarter box arrived, but I'm really enjoying this one so far. It's about as easy to learn as Chess or Go-- I've taught it to four other people so far, including people who aren't really gamer types, and none of them have had problems picking it up. All of them found it enjoyable.

On the topic of Chess and Go, it feels similar to both, but is still its own unique game; not a knockoff of either one. The ways of thinking you learn from playing Chess or Go might serve you well, but none of the actual strategies translates particularly well. It's more dynamic than Go, because of the ways pieces move/stack and the small size of the board, and it's more fluid than Chess, because where you are and what squares you control is less important than what's on those squares and what you can do with it.

Even disregarding the extra bits I got for backing the Kickstarter, this box set is still really nicely put together. The two-sided board is nice, though I haven't used it much since I got the wooden "arcanist's board" from the kickstarter. The pieces are well-made, the capstones are pleasantly knobby. And even if you're not a lore-nerd as I am, the two different shapes of the pieces for each color (rounded "cane" pieces for black and trapezoidal "merchant" pieces for white) means that the board looks visually interesting while you're playing, so it's a little more pleasant to parse; you're not just staring at a board of identical pieces stacked on top of one another.

Most games that balance such elegant simplicity with such strategic depth take many centuries to evolve (such as Go and Chess).  It is a great credit to James Ernest that he was able to design it from scratch in a far shorter time and a credit also to Patrick Rothfuss for creating the fictional world and description of the game that inspired Ernest to do so!

The game is simple to learn but 2 weeks and 20 games in and I am still far from mastering the nuances of advanced play.  I hope Tak will see enough success that it spawns local and global tournaments.  I would certainly enjoy the challenge of playing in them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Excellent little game, and connected to a modern fantasy series, no less.  I bought into the Kickstarter back when it first launched, and after playing a couple of games, it seems like a a good investment.

Pros:
-Simple pieces and board (it's easy to replace or substitute bigger boards or more pieces), virtually no set up, easy to transport.

-Teaching the rules to your partner or group takes 5-15 minutes, including discussing examples, so the explanation-to-play ratio is excellent.

-Great concept.  It's a more advanced version of -- and combination of -- checkers and tic-tac-toe.  There's far more strategy than either, because in this game, stacks of blocks can be moved in 3 dimensions, and none of it is done is a linear fashion.  

-Chess has more pieces, and it takes longer to learn chess strategies and openings and so on; very often, beginning chess players stall fairly quickly.  With Tak, it's dynamic without the complications; you still get to think in abstract, spatially-reasonable ways to keep it challenging, but it doesn't seem to have (given my limited number of plays) any situations that truly stall your development of strategy.

Cons:
-The only real concern I have is the price vs. the simplicity of the pieces.  Granted, as a Kickstarter backer, I have no problem paying a premium.  But if this game gets a wide release and still costs $30-55... well, the pieces just aren't worth that much.  In fact, you could make a poor-man's version of this game with just paper, if you wanted.  There are certainly other factors to consider -- licensing, art, instructions, special pieces, concept book, etc. -- but I still think that $15-25 is more the sweet spot for this game.

This game is absurdly good.  I made my account here just to post a review of Tak.  Somehow Patrick Rothfuss and James Ernest managed to combine enough genius to make what was supposed to be the fictional equivalent of Chess into a playable game.  This game not only surpasses my already high opinion of Chess, it does for mostly every person I play it with or teach it to.  There is more interesting tactical complexity in this simpler game than Chess.  It's more exciting and dynamic than Go.  And it's always fun to play at any skill level. 

If you hone your skills at a game like Chess, there aren't that many ways to play with people who either outmatch your rank or fall in at a lower rank.  There is so much meta around games like Chess and Go because the set of sensible moves is severely limited by either the restrictive rules and use-cases of the pieces (Chess) or expected formulaic patterns within patterns (Go).  Tak manages to avert this by offering gameplay in which extremely complex patterns can evolve from extremely simple rules, all while maintaining an extreme range of differing moves in any turn's set of sensible moves.  It is still fun to play with someone at mismatched skill level to yours, because in Tak you or they can always 'scale back' your skill by playing it in a way that you win 'beautifully,' hence Bredon's (from the fantasy series this was spawned from) phrase, playing "A beautiful game."  The game itself can even be fun to play against yourself as a sort of puzzle, because you'll end up surprising yourself over and over again after seeing how a particular strategy worked out in a way you could never have guessed.

This is not to say that the Tak community will not evolve its own meta; it certainly already has.  But I believe from the 100+ hours of Tak I've played that there is not a meta that can be broken in less than several unique ways, some of which may seem like poor choices to your opponent at first play.  The game is dynamic enough that it sometimes rewards the bold, the defensive, the tenacious, and nearly any player of any other style.

Another plus is that games can be as quick as you like; you can easily choose the size of board you want to play on.  The game has ordained piece-counts for board sizes from 3x3 (10 minutes) all the way to 8x8 (could be hours among highly skilled players).  The classic set (boxed set) comes with all the pieces you need to play a game up to size 6x6.  I usually play 4x4 games when I'm teaching someone new how to play, or want a quick game; 5x5 games when I want a fuller, more thoughtful experience; and 6x6 games when I would like a real challenge.  I have only played 5 or 6 games at 8x8, it is extremely difficult to make it last very long unless both players have played many, many games.  In some of these games I've probably been the most engaged I've ever been when playing a board game in my life, and I have probably played upwards of thousands of games of chess.

Give this game a shot, it's a mind bender that will leave you wanting more each game.  Physical Tak sets might be hard to get your hands on, as I just received mine from the Tak Kickstarter a few days ago (27/1/2017).  It said a few days ago on Patrick Rothfuss's website that Tak orders may be fulfilled in February.  The set itself is very nicely finished, wood pieces are stained evenly and pleasantly, and appear to be hand-sanded.  The board itself is a high-density cardboard laminated with an extremely satisfying linen finish.  The board it comes with is hybridized (it has demarcations) for each standard board size from 3x3 to 6x6.  Fan of The Name of the Wind (the book series that Tak is based on) or not, this game deserves to be in every board games or chess/go player's collection.

In the mean time, try playing online with the computer or other real players at playtak.com before you even buy it, it's free.

RATING: 6.5
Pretty good connection game vaguely derived from Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller books. The goal is to build a "road" of orthogonally-adjacent tiles between any two opposing sides of the board. Tiles can be placed on the board either flat, as roads, or standing, as walls; alternatively, a tile can be moved to an adjacent space, possibly on top of a tile or stack of tiles already there. If a stack moves, tiles are distributed from the bottom for each space it moves over. Players also have a "capstone" piece which acts as both a road (part of connections), a wall (can't be built over) and can flatten walls.

It's not a bad game but the the rating appears to be derive primarily from the selection effect of fans of the books backing the extraordinarily overpriced Kickstarter. Much of the charm is in the potential for large stacks to be dramatically redistributed, and from that perspective there's a nice arc to it -- the board tends to crowd until it's easy for a game to go either way. The capstone is inelegant but I think it's required to avoid 5x5 games constantly ending in stalemate.

I wouldn't choose it over, say, one of the GIPF games, but it's better than most of the wide-release abstracts (like the Gigamic titles). My copy was $10 and it's worth that but I'm glad I didn't pay retail.

Superb abstract!  Seriously amazing!  After making my own copy out of a .75 x 1.5 inch by 8 foot piece of wood I bought a Home Depot for $1, my family and I have played probably 50 games of it.  My 5 & 7 year old boys played for 60 minutes by themselves and it seemed balanced between them.  They loved tricking each other.

The "amazing" aspect is that even the 4x4 has layers of strategy and trickery for the unwary opponent.  My daughter (13) and I just laugh and laugh as we suddenly realize we missed an obvious road or pathway.  

I am looking forward, in good time, to expanding the game to a 5x5.  We are just exploring standing stones (walls) at this point.

Just today I spent a couple of hours creating a board out of a piece of 1/2 inch thick cedar I found in the garage.  The board wasn't wide enough, so I cut up an old leather shoe, made some hinges out of it and made it work.  t used the 4x4 design with the diamond expansion and etched it in with pencil and black Sharpie.  Looks good!  Heirloom quality.  :)  

Even if you don't like abstracts--I don't--consider making or buying a copy from Cheapass.  This is an instant classic.  A chess for today!

An inoffensive abstract puzzle game, and while it was enjoyable, it doesn't stand out in the market today.

RATING: 8
A modern abstract with a classic look and feel, imagined by a wonderful author and created by a prolific designer.

Simple rules: place or move, connect opposite sides of the board. Feels like a cross between Go and Checkers, with depth somewhere between...

RATING: 9
Great game! Has an ancient feel to it like Chess, Go, Checkers or Nine Men's Morris despite being published in 2016. However, the gameplay with the goal of building a road across the board, the flat and standing pieces, the capstones, etc. is unique to this enjoyable game.

I supported the Kickstarter at the the Arcanist's Pack level + the Crazy Martin Piece Pack. Thus, I have: 
1) The Classic Set - the standard first edition game box.
2) The Arcanist's Board - nice wooden board for 5x5 and 6x6 games.
3) The Tavern Set - very portable, no board, pieces supporting up to 5x5 in a small drawstring bag.
4) The Crazy Martin Piece Pack - extra Classic set pieces in draw string back. Works as a larger Tavern Set as well as expansion for the Classic Set allowing 8x8 play!
5) The Collector Coin - goes in my Tavern Set bag to be used as center of the virtual board. 
6) Cloth Board - Kickstarter version Tak board printed on a piece of cloth - very portable.
7) Companion Book - Kickstarter book with extra info about the game including thematic backstories and additional variant rules.

very portable mini version of the game: No board and small pieces supporting up to 5x5 in a small drawstring bag. I have added the Tak Collector Coin to the bag to use as a marker of the center of the virtual board.

Just got this for another travel compatible abstract - and I love the story of how it came to be. It helps that the game is quite fun to play, too. And I love its simplicity, it definitely feels like a game that could be around for centuries, being reduced to the bare minimum of rules necessary to make it work.

Chris Kickstarted this, but also made us a home-made board from a printout and some wooden pieces and a branch from the yard which he cut up with the circular saw.

This is an okay two player, abstract strategy game. Unfortunately, it's rarely going to be the two player game I reach for.

This has been a great game, I love how it feel worn in. It has not reached that feeling of Hive and Chess where the openers are always the same.  It reminds me of Go mixed with Mancala.  I love how the rules are free to all and custom sets are encouraged.

We picked this up from kickstarter and it came on my wife's birthday.  So we just had to play a couple of rounds.  The rules, as advertised are fairly easy.  I won several times by playing aggressively, but also lost to my own foolishness.  We got the simple pieces with a cloth board, but I could see picking up a nicely crafted set as a replacement for a chess set.

Kickstarted! (Capstone/Companion Book) - Received on 10 Jan 2017.

An easy choice to replace chess in your game collection.  Once we got the hang of things, the games can go fairly quickly.  One thing to keep in mind when planning your next move is to make sure you see what your opponent is doing.  A good game can end quickly if you are trying to think multiple moves ahead and fail to notice the road they have made and are about to complete.

RATING: 9
Crafted by Print & Play Production and Andrew Tullsen.

Game designed by: Barry Doyle

Sophisticated but elegant rules set are what makes this WWII squad level game stand out for me. The rules do not bog the game experience down like some other games in this class. I really like the assault rules and casualty point system. Great art work on the counters and map boards. Currently there is a large number of scenarios downloadable on BGG. I like that the game includes the European and Pacific theaters. There are even counters and scenarios for the French, Italian, and Polish nationalities. A very complete game and currently my favorite WWII squad level game bar none. VERY well done!!

An amazing gift to the wargaming crowd.  The designer did a terrific job of creating rich, "realistic" gameplay with a relatively simple ruleset.  There is a small learning curve, but the game holds its own against anything else. 

For comparison, I also own Conflict of Heroes, and while it's "better", that's not to take anything at all from Victory and Valor. I value -- and play -- both!

RATING: 5
I guess technically I own this since I downloaded all the files and the vassal mod?

It's okay. I'm not crazy about the armor rules (results are too binary) and the scale seems to encourage creating big stacks (or at least I haven't found a reason not to). The casualty system is really nifty. 

One thing I don't like (and I wouldn't like about a lot of tactical wargames I suppose) is the highly structured turn sequence. I realize this goes all the way back to Squad Leader, but I prefer more fluid systems where the player decides in what order things resolve, like Combat Commander or Up Front. I think the latter type of system gives a better feel for real time. 

Seems like with some more work it could shine but I think I just like more moving parts in my games. Maybe my opinion would improve with some more interesting scenarios? The ones I played didn't grab me.

Update: I actually played a bit of Squad leader and the turn structure has grown on me somewhat. I still think it's kind of arbitrary, but it creates a nice game flow.

ASL lite seems like a good summary.  I don't know if I'm going to like this as well as Band of Brothers, but the excellent quality of the set Andrew made me caused me to break it out and give it a try.  Provisional rating until I have enough plays to be meaningful.

A great balance between play-ability and detail. Step loss system for infantry units gives you the feel of attrition if the battle grinds on too long.

I also compared base-model Sherman with a Tiger. Game system requires the Sherman to be very, very lucky to score a kill on a frontal shot, but possible if the Allied player can sneak around to the German's rear armour. Seems to agree with historic reality.

With all components available for free on BGG, no worries about OOP!

After a long USPS-induced delay, I am now the proud owner of a custom version of this game produced by Andrew and his PnP productions.  Custom in that it only has the American/Japanese counters , and only the Pacific maps. 

Andrew does an exceptional job of production.  I can't wait to try this out.

Waited unsuccessfully for Pacific scenarios that never came.  got tired of waiting, picked up White Star Rising, and never looked back.

RATING: 10
There's a lot of squad-level tactical games out there (and I've played them all) but I'd put this one at the top of the list along with ASL.  Both take diametrically opposite approaches to game design and production yet are quite successful; ASL is expensive and difficult to learn while V&V is FREE (save for the cost of building your own game from the online materials) and easy to get into.  ASL drips with complexity and detail while V&V has the minimum to produce a good tactical narrative.  V&V has enough boards and nationality variety to draw players into the game and keep them playing it, but can't possibly have the various modules and TPP that ASL has.  Still, it doesn't matter.  

This is a significant effort in so many ways and for so many reasons.  I'd hope to see more games follow V&V's particular design and publishing model, especially as games get more expensive and economic times are tough.  

Give this game a go--you'll be impressed by the play experience and the quality of this game!

Based on one solo play. 

This games owes a lot to Squad Leader, but it has much simplicity in it. I understand that the bloody nature of the combat simulates failed moral checks. 

I can't get past the fact that firearms have very "short" ranges. But I somewhat like the casualty system, which forces tough choices on both players. 

This is a fun game, which is light enough to be an introductory game to other tactical based of the same genre. 

UPDATE
Very good game! I definitely want to play again!

Print & Play beauty. A real gem among this category of games. When it comes to squad level games one of my favourite. The rules are well written and the game flow quick and full of tension. 

The two only problems are as follows:
1) You have to print and cut everything by yourself (if you do not want to buy a prepared copy) - not really a problem for those who like to spend their time with some glue and scissors. 
2) Some of the scenarios are not well balanced - you should avoid printing everything you find and consult the threads or sessions reports to check any tweaks to some of the original versions posted on the geek.

Interesting WW2 tactical game with easy to grasp rules, yet providing enough tension to engage even more seriuos grognards. The system is so far free, but the future is always uncertain, as the designer (Barry Doyle) has many interests and does not focus solely on V&V itself. User-made content is quite huge already, so the game can only profit from that.

An astoundingly good game, the more so because it is free. The rules are well designed and easily understandable, and the graphic design is first-rate. Unlike a lot of wargames, games don't take hours to finish, and keep both players involved at all times. 

While I wish there were more scenarios included, making them up yourself is not difficult, and there's hardly a shortage of WWII scenarios floating around if you find yourself at a loss.

RATING: 8
Two things worth doing re V&V - print onto high quality paper and make a paypal donation to the author.

Barry Doyle has addressed an audience that wants the nuances of a tactical game with units hopping over hedges and fighting through villages etc, without the complexity that so often is associated with these types of games.

Most tactical games share a heretige in John Hill's Squad Leader and so does this, but there are a lot of differences and it achieves a similar ambition with surprisingly few rules and very few die roll mofifiers. Indeed just spend a couple of hours one evening with this rulebook and you will be up and running without constant reference back to the rules. 

In particular, the tank rules are clean and simple, making them as simple to use as the infantry - that alone will make this a system of interest to a lot of people. 

I printed the units onto A4 (95% reduction) and the maps onto A3 (114% increase) .... the large hexes really do look good.

Overall, I really like this game, it does a lot of things right - There are a couple of areas that I am still pondering upon, these being the high casualty rate, particularly the attackers casualty costs for close assaulting buildings and the ability to fire twice before getting return fire by having defensive fire at the end of the enemy turn and then regular fire at the start of the next friendly turn, some more playing will give me a chance to better assess that.

Top marks to Barry for commitment in bringing this system in its superbly presented format, to the wider gaming community.

EDIT.. re my comments of high casualty cost for close assaulting buildings mentioned above (1) I am reading a book on tactics at the moment that discusses just how difficult and costly street fighting was, looks like the game has this right. (2) I hadn't realised that in the system, pinned units are auto eliminated by close assaulting units, so the system quite rightly, pushes the player to pinning units before close assaulting them, so encouraging proper tactics.... nice touch.

My 2nd hex-and-counters wargame.
Taking 15-30 minutes to resolve a single turn is a very different sort of game to anything I've played before.  Far more complexity than Napoleon at Waterloo, but after 2 battles I'm starting to get a sense for the flow of the rules.  There's enough of a sense of making progress, and of decisions making a difference.

I'm beginning to believe that WW2 just doesn't interest me.

Update: Re-discovering V&V while considering the newest, affordable ASL starter expansion pack. I should add a note that while V&V is "free" there is an opportunity cost in crafting. I enjoyed crafting it initially when putting the game together. It was a labor of love, and I think the homemade counters and maps show it.  

Nowadays, however, time is at a premium and I may explore the ready-made services that can be found on the Geek. 

...

An early rating. Excellent print-n-play project. After a number of infantry-only sessions, I'm now incorporating chrome with other scenarios. A great introduction to wargaming. I started to acquire other wargames and have come to greatly appreciate that the minutiae of other systems is streamlined in V&V.

Why isn't this game manufactured by a game company?  Because Mr. Doyle wanted to give it away to the community of wargamers!  

It is as good, or better, than the majority of the squad level games I've seen in the last few years. It allows for squad-level infantry and armor battles on isomorphic mapboards.  The designer continues to listen to his "customers," and is continuing to periodically crank out great new material.  Free for the downloading, and well worth the cost to print out and mount maps and pieces.  Unlike a lot of squad wargames, it has width, depth, and ease of play. Works well with the scenarios, or as a game kit.

Would I buy it if it were published?
Absolutely yes!  I'd buy a couple to give away as well.

I expect my rating of this game to rise as the amount of content increases.

If you're a wargame manufacturer, take note!

If you're a wargamer, make a copy and share it with someone else!

UPDATE: Barry may be self-publishing this.  Mark me down as eager to preorder or buy on Day One.  Good luck, Barry!

For example, not only is the potential damage in combat linked to your combined combat factor, but so is your chance to hit.  So if you have two equally matched single units fighting in a building (or a motar trying to hit somebody under cover), you can go round after round without anybody hitting or doing any damage.  Close assault with a unit or two is extremely deadly if you fail even if it is only 1 unit with cover.  As a result, you end up stacking several units in order to have a reasonable chance of doing any damage or simply sit around and wait for other guy to get impatient and make the first move.

RATING: 8
Brilliant interpretation of the GW universe in board game form.  A bit TOO simple for repeat play, but some simple rules tweaks (extra move) help a lot.  This is also the basis for our house rules:

Unplayable if the Alien player is playing this right. Then the Space Marines are cannon fodder no matter what they do.

One of the last of this type of game I really want, and boy do I want it bad...

Got a mostly complete copy--all the minis are there, barring one orc which I can easily replace, and the dreadnaught which is less easy but still not too bad.  But some of the marines are missing weapons, and I don't know how to simulate that easily.  Will have to get some advice.  

I am a huge fan of this type of game--MC:SOTC, Heroquest, etc.  I gave this one a go and really enjoyed it--missing some of the clip in weapons was annoying, but not insurmountable.  We played the second mission.  I think positioning blips is a learned skill, though I did come out okay in the end.  It doesn't reward being gung ho very much, since eventually a gretchkin will get a lucky shot on you and the point-loss difference is pretty key.  Creeping around, protecting the squad as much as possible--I'd love to play a campaign of it, but like MC:SOTC, it's hard to get something like that going.  I do really wish I had the dreadnaught--it's easy enough to fake, but the miniature is impressive visually.  

The "mostly complete" state of my game has led to me being annoyed with it.  I'm missing only those pieces that make it very inconvenient.  The sort of defensive tactics necessarily to succeed are very different from other games of this type.  As Ray pointed out, a lot of the time when you roll your dice nothing happens...and when something does happen, your guy dies.  

UPDATE--my copy is mostly complete--I can give more details if you're really interested. I like this game in theory but I never get a chance to play it, so if someone can give it the love it deserves, I'd be happy trading it.

Simple shoot 'em up. Fun to play but the downtime might become a major factor. There are some minor issues with the game design also but nothing too serious. Some fun can be found in this game.

I'm going to give this to my cousin's 10 year old son after I've finished the paintwork.

UPDATE September/2014
Ok, I never actually got finish the paintwork. It has been over four years since I last touched the brush let alone the game. The boy who would have rejoiced getting all painted up Space Crusade is now almost 15.

Al igual que con Hero Quest, muchos crecimos con este juego, o lo deseamos en secreto :-)... Un juego sencillo y creo recordar (hace muuuuchos años...) que bastante descompensado en favor de los marines. Al igual que Hero Quest, montones de miniaturas y de componentes de escenografía que hacían del juego algo más visual que otra cosa. Yo y mis primos empezamos con él al "agotar" Hero Quest y juraría que tenía algo más de posibilidades. Quizá a día de hoy revisándolo un poco con algunas reglas caseras podría valer para una tarde de revival de los 90...

One of the best miniatures games I own. The miniatures are really beautiful, the visuals of the game in general are really great. The game mechanics are not particularly exciting (in most missions you just have to move around, kill everything that moves and try to survive in the process), but the number of options (items, weapons, even tactics etc.) makes the game really entertaining

You think that the power sword and glove is the best bet? Sure rolling six dice is great.  Add the melta bombs in and it's 10 dice.  Even better right?  
Wrong.
When all ten dice come up with nothing and the dreadnought gets six hits your commander is dead.  It's about the guns, lots of guns.

Pedazo de juego. Hablo de memoria. pedazo de pedazo.

Una puerta perfecta para el Warhammer 40.000.

I have not played this game in over 10 years (my current group wouldn't go for this). However when I used to play it, and I would like to play it again, it was one of the best gaming experiences I have ever had! Hence the retrospective 10.The real joy from this game comes once you have gone through the missions in the rules and start to do your own. That's when you can become very creative as long as you realise to make a good game the alien player shouldn't want to win instead you want it to come down to the wire with the three commanders left preferable barely alive. That frees you up to deploy alien blips as you choose. If the marines are kicking ass, add more/tougher aliens. If you've got lucky - hold back a bit. Change the conditions for winning, add tyrannids, hybrids, rogue marines, change the board layouts - options are almost endless as long as the players know any house rules at the beginning. This game is so good once you spice it up.p.s. I got as much pleasure out of painting the minitures (see my pics) and for me well painted figures makes the game even better.I wish my group would play this game (Ticket to Ride brigade - which is cool as well in a very different way).

So many of today's games owe more than a nod to this MB fun-fest. Still looks great, my kids were really taken with the whole theme and play of the game. Somethings don't necessarily get better with age.
I've giving this an uprated mark as this game along with MB's Shogun formed the corner stones of my future love for board games and they should both be feted for that alone, even if newer designs have surpassed both games technically

I like it very much for three players, usually when I need to scratch that w40k itch.

It is great for a game, a campaign may be repetitive.

Just be sure to teach your players not to get very close to each other or they will be too exposed against area weapons. 

Also, the alien player usually should reserve the greater threats for the end and try to erode the Marines. A lucky Gretching can kill a Space Marine!

The biggest problem I have with this game is the  Blood Angels Captain, who I think is OP.

This game was fun for a short while.
It presents itself as a "Warhammer-40K-Spacemarines-kill-everything-xenos-massacre" and turns out to be "We-are-the-Galaxy-Safe-Guard-pew-pew-we-stun-and-freeze-but-we-never-harm-no-one" Its almost an Anti Gateway to WH40K ^_^
That take was horrible and unnecesary!
It is a try on merging WH40K with SpaceHulk, and it sucseedet on many ways. Espetially the Eldar Expansion had some great challenges and was for two players.
Finally, for me personally its either WH40K or SpaceHulk.

Got this as a child after I loved Hero Quest. Thought I was going to like it, seeing it was "more or less the same, but then in space". Never really got to like it as a kid, possibly because it was a bit more "advanced"? Haven't played it since, but I'm going to give it another shot soon...

Its a lighter, multiplayer version of Space Hulk.  Each player has their team of marines, and then one player controls all the bad guys. Some things are simplified to make it more accessible to youngsters.

I've enjoyed playing this with another father and each of our sons. The components are beautiful and really get the young players into it. I think you could also play with campaign rules and make it a more serious game, although I prefer Mutant Chronicles for that role. 

Overall, I think this is a bit inferior to Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel. The rules seem a bit looser and the overall complexity is less (which is appropriate for the younger audience towards which I think it was targeted).

Milton Bradley really dropped the ball by not releasing SPACE CRUSADE to U.S. gamers- this is their magnum opus, one of the most opulently produced board games I've ever seen.  It gives Fantasy Flight's best work a run for the money.  The game is sort of a simplified hybrid of Space Hulk and Heroquest and it is refreshingly straightforward, easy to play, and most importantly a lot of fun.  The game isn't rocket science, and doesn't presume to be and it's not cluttered up with a bunch of nonsense like DESCENT or the more modern iterations of this genre tend to be.  You move and shoot with each of your marines or aliens, and that's about it.  They have some special equipment, there might be some random events, but it never bogs down the essential scoot-and-shoot gameplay.  Arguably, this game is the best and most succinct way to experience the Warhammer 40K universe and with the White Dwarf add-ons and two expansions there's plenty of replayability and options to take the game wherever you want it to go.  I do think that the competitive/cooperative campaign of Mutant Chronicles is a little more interesting, but that game doesn't have Chaos Space Marines and Heavy Bolters- in short, Space Crusade edges it out by having much better chrome, graphic design, and atmosphere.  The pace can seem a little slow at times when players are moving 5 marines a turn and sometimes it seems like the alien player has a pretty tough time winning.  I also feel like some more advanced options (such as Overwatch) should have been incorporated into the basic game since it would add strategic depth without increasing complexity.  Minor complaints aside, this is a real treat for fans of 40K or dungeoncrawling in general.

One chaos player plays against up to 3 space marine players, who have boarded a space hulk and are trying to complete mission objectives.  Very cool game, the sci-fi cousin of Heroquest, released by Milton Bradley about the same time as GW released Space Hulk.  They share a common theme, and great miniatures!  Modular components mean different setups for the missions.  The marines board the game map and use simple move/fire or fire/move rules to clear out the hulk.  The chaos player runs blips around the board that can be converted into anything from puny gretchin to dreadnoughts!  The miniatures are stunning and feature a swag of clip on light or heavy weapons (especially if you add in the Mission Dreadnought and Eldar Attack expansions).  Great rules for campaign games where you earn rank and medals for extra equipment in future missions.  Very retro but very cool game.

RATING: N/A
Only played once so far, and I'm not sure if the rules were taught properly, so I'll withhold my rating until I can try it again.  My initial impressions were that it would be a fun game to play with kids, but doesn't seem to offer the same level of thematic fun as Heroquest.  The dice seem to miss too often (or the enemy armor is too high), so there are perhaps too many moments where nothing exciting happens. I may need to learn how to use the cards better though.

Things were going great but I just stalled out. And not having everything magnetized is what keeps me from playing which has to be the dumbest and stupidest excuse for not playing a game. If you grew up on HeroQuest and BattleMasters this is a must.

Bought this for 1 euro from a kid (who obviously didn't know the game!!! I didn't either at that time!)
Played the computergame (from Gremlin) very often. My friend gets completely insane when he gets to play the "Aliens". Phrases from films like Aliens are used very often while playing. Great fun! (although it looks a bit dated nowadays)

Boyfriend squealed he was so excited to find this one and so playing the dutiful girlfriend we sat down to a game although I was dubious because all the games he loved as a child have turned out to be awful.

This is not the case with this one. Its actually pretty good. Brutal and unforgiving, but pretty good. There are the beginnings of customisability for player characters and a wide variety of bad guys for the alien player. 

It is brutal, but its brutal for both sides. My assault cannon guy died to a mob of gretchin but my bolt guy guy held his own against a genestealer. The aforementioned genestealer then keeled over to the bolt gun guy on the my next turn but the blood angels ran into an invincible ork!

I look forward to playing this again.

I was introduced to this game at a convention in Madison. I had played a bit of HeroQuest back in the day and the owner of it mentioned that it was the space themed version of HeroQuest.  We played with the operation dreadnought expansion and it was a hoot.  The first version that I was able to buy here was the Finnish version, which I got for the components. I was finally able to find an English language version and will never let this game go.  The mechanics seem to be better than HeroQuest's mechanics and all the components are just top notch. Highly recommended for an introductory game for non-boardgamers who like science fiction.  I honestly don't understand why this game hasn't been reprinted as I find very few flaws in the design and none in the most crucial -- FUN factor. :)

Around the time my brother got HeroQuest, I got Space Crusade (I'd always been a sci-fi fan).

The selection of plastic miniatures was good and the marines had interchangeable weapons and upgrade cards.

Adquirido usado con defectos menores. 

Juego tematico clasico ambientado en el universo de Warhammer 40K. Mas accesible y menos duro que space hulk u otros juegos de la "rama", adecuado para 3-4 jugadores y al mismo tiempo un reto nada facil que superar. 

En materiales evidentemente no es un juego actual (se nota sobre todo en el carton y los paneles de los jugadores), pero en mi opinion una parada obligatoria (y no igualada o mejorada por juegos mas modernos, con la posible excepcion del Doom) para los aficionados a la tematica y a los juegos de aventura y accion.

The basic game I give a 6 - add two (or more) basic sets together, thus increasing the possible board combinations, squad size and Alien deployment which makes for a much much better game. Squad vs Squad home made scenarios start to work under this format too.

The good bits of Warhammer 40K with none of the fuss.

RATING: 7
Not as good as Heroquest, it certainly lacks a coherent storyline and diversity like furniture, traps or special equipment, causing every mission to feel a bit samey. A big plus, however, is the fact that the chaos player can also really win the game which grands him advantages in later missions.

After making my way through HeroQuest, I had to get this too. I split the cost with my brother, I think, but I have the game. I didn't quite finish painting the components. There were a lot of them, and my inspiration kind of ran out on the painting front. I couldn't really come up with a good colour scheme for the goblin guys. I kind of left it. The game plays well though. I broke it out with my nephews some years ago and they really enjoyed it. Then I bought them a started set of Warhammer 40,000 and they played it briefly before it sat quietly on a shelf somewhere. Ah well.

There are a great many options built into the game and  it's always a blast to play.  If memory serves, it does become easier for the Marines as the # of players goes up, even though the Alien player is made stronger.  One thing that is missing is the "hot seat" nature of Siege of the Citadel, where the GM role can rotate between players from one game to the next.

Another toy factor game. Basically "Heroquest" in space. If you like a sci-fi theme and enjoy a quick lite dungeonromp, here's your game. Strategy is limited but it's there. Still has that WOW! look at all the cool stuff going for it. As a plus many of the figures can be used in your other Warhammer 40K games. Especially suited for Space Hulk.

There should only be one victory rule specified for the Space Marines (and nothing for the Alien) which is 'get out alive after trying to obtain any mission token, then count up to see who didn't lose the most for a winner'.

Bought it back in the early 90s when it came out, butI only played it a few times before canibalizing the parts for Warhammer 40k.

 I believe I still have a few parts from my original set too...some Goblins I think...

A beautiful game with lots of customizable components. Unfortunately, this coolness factor is tempered by the extremely random nature of the game. Tactics and strategy don't seem to be as important as rolling well. And the Alien side seems severely hampered by the fact that they couldn't customize or pick any skills.

Mine is homemade (I just bought the commercial game too).
This is a fun space skirmish game. The fire and movement rules are very simple. The selection of monsters don't make sense, and the graphics are a little dated, but is a less claustrophobic version of Space Hulk.
Out of print, but you can use the big box version of Risk 2210 A.D. for miniatures and board (cutting and gluing involved). Starcraft miniatures also work.
It is easy to replace a Marine squad with a homebrew, like Dark Eldar.

Always loved space marines,this game allow you and your friend to command a team of them against an alien player,The most funny thing is that between mission your marines get promotion and better equipment,but also the mission get more difficult,And even if different team works togheteragainst alien they are in competition to get kills and better point score at the end,so there are no real alliances.

RATING: 7
A fun, simple game that has both Warhammer 40K's dark flavor and a goofy charm.  Orks, Chaos Marines and genestealers teaming up and living together?  And whatever happened to the Chaos android?  The experience system lets you grow in power if you survive.  This gives you an incentive to play competitively and keeps the game interesting for many more plays than otherwise.  Might still become repetitive with enough plays, since it's just the same old boards and enemies over and over.  But because the rules apply to any square-grid board you could play this using Space Hulk, Advanced Space Crusade or just buy a big Chessex square-grid board and draw your own hulk each game.  I feel that this game gives you your money's worth long before you exhaust its possibilities.  Oh and it's lightning fast by GW standards.

Now this is what I was hoping Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel would have been (although that is a pretty good game as well). Lots of options for the Space Marines, and the missions just get better and better. Right now I would rate this a solid "8" but with more plays I can definitely see this rising to a "9." Playing as the alien is a fun time, and definitely requires some positional strategy. This is truly an Ameritrash classic. If you like Space Hulk, but want to play with more players pick this one up. Being able to use the Dreadnought is just plain kick ass.

This is where real board gaming started for me. A friend had purchased StarQuest (Dutch version) and had painted all the miniatures really beautifully. Four of us gathered together in weekends about 4 times a year to plya this, and later other games as well. Almost 20 years later we still have the group (twice a year now), but we don't play StarQuest anymore. The game itself was biased heavily to the Chaos player, once he knew what he was doing. I wouldn't rate the game 8 today, but it's there for sentimental reasons :)

This is an exellent game to break out once in a while: it's fast, it's simple and it has big guns! Best played with a few beers though as the game is perhaps best enjoyed while smack-talking and imitating gunfire.......POW!!! WOOSH! Die alien SCUM!! 

Also, owning the D&D boardgame (what was i thinking! -D'oh!) i have some additional modular boards so my marines can now do some nice planetary assaults...

One of my all-time favorites. An excellent adventure game especially when you combine two boards into a huge last-man-standing match with all space marines players competing against each other as well as the monster player.

HeroQuest in space. Well, almost. ;) When I was a kid this was a very cool game (not as cool as HeroQuest though). It's about commanding a space marine units in an alien infested space stations. The Amiga/PC-version of the boardgame is slightly more playable as no one needs to be the gamelord which is quite boring. Great components!

Another game from my youth. This one I never played as much as Space hulk or Buck rogers, but loved just as much, if not slightly less because I could tell that it was lightened down for broader audiences. At the time this came out I was dabbling in actual 40k, so this was the game I could actually find people to play with, while the wargame was the one I really wanted to play.

Oh games workshop where did it all go wrong ? This fast, frantic fight for survival sucks you right into the eye of terror and makes you smile as you lay waste to whatever nasty creatures the darkest parts of space can throw at you. With your games these days I need to read a spirit crushing 300 page rulebook and roll 1000 dice after measuring millimetres and selling my kidney to buy half an army that I'll never finish painting (rant over). This game is pure,simple,critter stomping fun and it's all the better for it. Excellent.

Following [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/699/heroquest]Heroquest[/url] success, MB released this space-themed version.
The box is rich, but somehow I've always enjoyed the fantasy setting more; also because, here, the game is clearly unbalanced against the marines and guess who played them all the time? Better head for [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2163/space-hulk]Space Hulk[/url] rather than this one.

I got this for £2.99 from a charity shop. It didn't have any models but we rummaged the bits needed out of other games and had really good fun.

A full four player game is excellent, and the evil player gets to have a good time packing monsters into every corner of the board.

Sadly it just sits in a cupboard now as I once again have no models to play it with!

The game itself is another piece of 80s GW magic. Lots of plastic, basic rules and spades of luck make a 1 vs up to 3 Space Hulk-Light game, where luck can kill your whole team in a turn or allow you to plough through 30 aliens without getting so much as a scratch.

Lots of fun but aimed at kiddies really.  Doesn't hold up tactically or strategically but has ace minis and a great theme, even if Gretchin fighting hand in hand with Chaos Space Marines and Genestealers is a bit off, there is way more variety here than in Space Hulk or Advanced Space Crusade.  Doom kicks its arse though.

GREAT GAME!!!! I own the Italian version, called "StarQuest". The game is simple, fast, nice and beautiful. We (me and friends) have played all missions, buy the two expansion, played all again, and now, with a second box, we play a "all counters vs all counters" just for fun, at least 1 time per month. YOU CAN'T MISS THIS GAME. You can also find on the web rules to play with a Ork Squad (!), with Terminators, and with Scouts marines. I'm not a W40K player, so i can't tell you how much this game is far or close to, but you can find also rules to play in open fields, or rules "space hulk like".

RATING: 6
An ancestor in the long line of Ameritrash move/attack or attack/move games. There's a series of missions which you can play as a campaign, which has some neat carry over features depending on how successful you were in the previous mission (eg get more/less equipment in next mission). The alien player seeds the board with baddies. We played with a variant where an equal number of aliens must be seeded in each of the 4 sectors - which not only keeps the game moving faster because it spaces out the setup, but also provides more balanced fun for each of the players (it stops all aliens being placed in one person's sector, wiping him out, then moving them all into the next player's sector and so on). Each marine player has 1 commander and 4 marines. There's some setup which allows you to choose 1 of 4 different weapons for each marine (eg splash, all directions, direct lines), but the marines are easy to kill so don't get too attached. The commander's your main man, and basically you want to protect him until you find the big bad boss alien and kill it (in mission 1 anyway), then vamoose back out the exit. Turns are basic move then attack at range (die rolls against armour) or in adjacent melee (both sides roll, higher wins). It's all straightfoward, but it works just as fine as any of its modern day competitors, and it has great components. The score system is an interesting touch but you can play it as a straight co-op without it if you like - marines score for mission success plus baddies killed less dead marines, the alien kind of scores for the inverse. Anyway, for a 1990 game, it holds up very well.

Great game from 1990! Cool minis (of course old ones). Since then, they have never released a board game where the weapons of the figures can be replaced in reality. Wonderful Idea!
Variable gaming terrain, modern games are also honored! In addition, game makers did not fail to make the surface too dark. IN Space Crusade is all perfect!
It is also possible to know that there is still a major fan club, although the board game has not been released again for 30 years. Do not give up again because I bought two old sets :)

A terrific game of space marines vs. aliens on a space hulk!  Real simple (and mostly intuitive) rules make it easy to learn, teach and play.  More straightforward fun and less tedious than WH40K (not a million rules, dice and tapemeasures) - but you can add expansions, new rules, and even (if you want to, which we did) turn it into a full tabletop game with vehicles etc.  You are able to enjoy refreshments, talk with your friends, and still have a great (and sometimes tense and exciting) time stalking the aliens/shredding the marines.  ... Feel the fear as a door slides open ... curse when the Genestealer drops down next to your assault cannon marine ... hear the crowd cheer when the Commander takes out the Dreadnought in hand-to-hand combat - it's Space Crusade!  Thanks Milton Bradley (and Games Workshop).

Baby's First Space Hulk is about as dull as Baby's First Warhammer Quest. The chief saving grace is that the alien player isn't just a facilitator like HeroQuest's dungeon master, but can win based on points just like one of the Space Marine players.

The resulting luckfest is painfully unbalanced and unpleasant for all concerned. Years ago I envied my cousin for owning the game, but that nostalgia was a poor reason to pick up a copy now. 20 years on the components no longer seem so impressive and the gameplay was emphatically not worth the wait.

A great selection of miniatures, with a neat design of being able to easily swap out different weapons on the models to show what weapon they are carrying.  The gameplay is fast with a simple but fun system.  This game would get a better rating if the boards were better; with just 4 boards it lacks the variety of setup of Space Hulk or Siege of the Citadel, and the 'blip' concept is poorly executed here.  A few house rules for scenarios would help this game a lot.

I played all missions back in the 1990s and had a lot of fun with my brother and two other friends. I had a real cool Marine commander who used to attack Dreadnoughts hand to hand with his power glove.
Later we committed to other games and the game rested on top of my brother's cupboard for years (and it still lies there, I believe).
These days I am married and playing boardgames with my 8-year old, so I searched eBay and bought another set for playing with him. Back on the saddle!

Is it just the first scenario that is basically broken, or are they all like that?

In order for the game to be balanced, the GM is required to essentially spawn the Dreadnaught as far away as possible from both landing spots. The Commanders are ridiculously overpowered; he has 6 hit points, probably close enough to be able to win the mission on his own. In our game, one player increased his Commanders armour to 3, making him impossible to hit with >80% of the monsters in the game. The other player had the ability to completely reheal his Commander back to full health.

Dice rolls that are hard to achieve, but kill with one success essentially ensures random, swingy games.

Just poor.

I can't remember who in the gang had a copy of this, but we played it one night and it was a riot! I'm sure we should have taken it more seriously, but there were times when we were crying with laughter! Probably one of those "you had to be there" moments, and all of us still have fond memories of that night over a decade ago. But we tried to play it again a few years later, and it was just... dull. Shame - but then Space Hulk was always so much better!

HeroQuest meets Warhammer 40K in space. Not quite as good as the inspiration; the concept of players leading teams competing against each other, instead of single characters doing teamwork just doesn't seem to be as much fun. Seems to have some balancing problems as well (at least mission 1) but this may be largely a style of play issue. Definitely needs more plays.

The game that played a large part in establishing my love for boardgames (although not as large a part as Hero Quest did). Very thematic game with great components, but it is too bad that the endgame is seriously flawed. More often than not, victory is decided between the Dreadnought and the red Commander and the results they roll. After Space Hulk was added to my library, I only returned to this game when playing with kids. Still, this game brings back lots of happy memories! Also: The game is much better when played with the Mission Dreadnought expansion.

In this dark version of the far future the Space Marines have found and abounded starship. The game starts with the Alien Player reading out one of the missions. A map in in the Mission Manual then shows the Alien player how to setup the game boards and Docking boards. The Mission Manual also tell the Alien player how many, and which, Blip tokens he should take, as well as which Reinforcement tokens he may use to fight the other players Space Marines

I give it a 5 because I expected so much more from it. I had Hero Quest and I expected better from Space Crusade. I didn't like the bleep tokens even if I understand what they are meant to represent. The marines seemed overpowered too and there wasn't much of a challenge, plus the game board was a bit too unidimensional. It was a boring game. It was fun shooting at foes but there was no real sense of exploration.

another great game that was on my side for a very long time. we played this hours and hours and had a great time tinkering with selfmade stuff. as with the german Heroquest version, it is not so easy to beat all players when GMing. i remember the first time i wiped out three marinesquads (without genestealers, just the grunts), as if it were yesterday. i'm almost sure it was the only time i could pull this off.

My favourite childhood game. Yes, even above HeroQuest. Unfortunately, it also proved to be the sly dealer that sucked me into the Warhammer 40,000 drug habit, I mean game. Most of the minis were chopped up and/or horribly painted in an attempt to use them for 40K. Bereft of playing pieces, Space Crusade sat alone and unloved in storage for decades until I finally tracked down some spares. And discovered that it wasn't as interesting as I remembered. Oh well. 

Still a reasonably fun, videogamey, splat-the-aliens romp. Someday, some unsuspecting nephew or niece will find it among their birthday presents, and the galaxy will once again quake before the awesomeness of the huge grey plastic killer robot that you can break into pieces when it blows up.

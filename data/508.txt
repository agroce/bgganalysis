Beautiful counters, particularly the Oriflam edition, 'Les Ailes de la Gloire'. Never got much table time, traded away together with the RAFM Blue Max Miniatures Rules including charts for 30 new aircraft in March 2007.

I remember playing this game in the 80s with a bunch of fanatics at a game store in Dallas. I was into D&D and Gamma World back then. I walked in, saw these guys playing it and fell in love. I played the hell out of this game back then, but haven't seen it in years. I owned a copy that went through hundreds of plays, but I'm not sure where it went, it vanished long ago. Or maybe it flew away.

Field Command of the sky. Awesome game especially when you start getting into pilot careers and accumulating their experience. Works with 2 player but is much better with more. It do do with some scenarios being designed there seems to be ample room within the rules, map and planes to design such. 

After much consideration I opted to buy the older edition. I just found the new edition lacking in too many departments. One of which is that it only comes with a very limited amount of planes compared with the older edition.

I played this a few times on YouPlay.It but an air combat games without altitude rules is like a PB&J sandwich without the PB&J. There's just no point. Even worse, they don't float the game board so everything happens in this horrible little artificial box in the sky. Ugh.

I have played this game a considerable number of times and have even played it over the internet and by email. Works superbly for multi-player dig fights and the rules can be adapted for miniatures. Look out on the web for the 'Canvas Eagles' additions to the game which give a much wider number of aircraft and some of the early years aircraft in particular. In particular I love the damage system in this game which really provides a system that chips away at the aircraft capabilities, is hidden form the opponent (trust applying) and yet can result in the unexpected spectacular.

This is the best all around WWI air combat set of rules for miniatures that I have played.  It is not the most complex, it does not contain a ton of realism issues that you have to contend with.  It is a well balanced game that gives you the proper feel of WWI air combat and the distinct differences that each plane had back then.  My go to system for WWI airplanes.

I feel strangely ambivalent about this game - it's a fun, simple and fast game of fighter combat which is more realistic than Ace of Aces or Wings of War (which is admittedly not saying much), but which is clunkier than the streamlined WoW and less pure fun than the clever AoA.  However, this game shines brighter than either AoA or WoW - much brighter - when playing with more than 2 planes per side.

Wings of War/Glory has taken its place, but I think Blue Max is the better game.

This is definitely one of my favorite games. It's the first "Gamer" game I really played, and you never forget your first love. I really enjoy the simultaneous movement mechanic.  I never fail to have a good time with this game, even when I get shot down in flames.  I especially enjoy playing the Red Baron.  I know it's not a very good reality simulation, but it's still fun to play.  

Looking for another copy of the 1st Edition.  I'm missing 1 damage counter and have 2 extra damage counters.  I'm willing to make a swap.

I was always into WWI aeroplanes, and when I found this game on youplay.it, I was quickly hooked.  I wound up purchasing a used copy of the boxed game (there's just something about actually rolling the die, going to the tables, and especially drawing the damage chits!).

I find the movement system very elegant, and really dig the simultaneous movement and how easily and quickly it handles massive furballs.  The random blind damage is also very fun.  The thing I like about youplay.it that is not in the board game is the option to show the previous plane positions, I've thought of implementing this in my board games using previous position markers.  This helps in judging airspeed and whatnot.

All in all this is a great simple game.  Easy to learn and fun to play.

Un juego clasico de combate aereo en la Primera Guerra Mundial. Es muy divertido y pueden jugar sin problemas hasta 4 o 5 jugadores por bando. El reglamento no es complicado y se puede explicar en 20 minutos. La edicion espanola de Disenos Orbitales es excelente. Desgraciadamente solo se puede encontrar de tanto en tanto en Ebay

Cada jugador "pilota" un aeroplano que tiene unas caracteristicas propias: velocidad, maniobrabilidad, una o dos ametralladoras, resistencia al fuego enemigo, autonomia de vuelo... Hay aviones mucho mejores que otros (como era la realidad historica).

Las partidas son rapidas (pueden jugarse dos o tres en una tarde) y apasionantes. Si un piloto sobrevive, adquiere experiencia y mejora sus habilidades.

Mis unicas objeciones son que el factor azar puede ser decisivo, y que es muy dificil competir con malos aeroplanos contra otros mejores.

hojas de vuelo remaquetadas

pendiente de buscarle unos aviones chachis. algo parecido a lo que viene de serie en Wings of War, para solucionar el principal defecto del juego: que es feo a morir. calidades print&play y del regulero, tablero plano, aviones presentados con fichas...

el juego en si es combates entre aviones en la era de la WWI. no es dificil de jugar pero al principio el tema de las maniobras y la suma del resultado de combate intimida un poco. 

un defecto obvio son las fichas cuadradas. el que fueran hexagonales (lo cual ocurre en la reedicion) ayuda bastante al posicionamiento correcto en las primeras ocasiones.

Our group played this every week for over a year. One guy developed charts for every plane used, and we played the entire war, each session being 1 month of game time. All plane counters went into a bag and each picked one. Sometimes the sides were unbalanced, but, boy, did that make you sweat! Points were allocated for kills and just surviving. We enjoyed it so much that when we finished we started again from the begining again....

RATING: 7
The differences between the planes are often subtle.  I wish Canvas Eagles maintained the damage system applied here when carrying over nearly everything else, as the random chits draws for damage (sort of duplicated in Hornet Leader and Thunderbolt/Apache Leader) allow more for a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants dogfight.

At its heart, Blue Max is essentially an abstract game played on a hex board.  The playing pieces represent aircraft from WWI with speed, maneuvers and attacking values based on their real-life equivalents. As for the theme, well, I've been interested in WWI air combat ever since I read Biggles books as a kid.  I have many reference books on the topic of the war in the air in WWI.  So for me the theme is what I love about this game.  But it's not only that.  These are simple, playable rules that really capture the feel of combat with the different types of aircraft used in this conflict.  I have the miniatures rules version and I've painted up several 1/300 scale aircraft with which to have tabletop dogfights (for pictures see http://ozvortex.blogspot.com/search/label/Blue%20Max%20-%20WWI%20Air%20Combat).  I also play this game regularly online at www.youplay.it where I have played 900+ games.  Look for my username Ozvortex.  PM me if you ever want to play a game.  [Number of games played face-to-face = 2].  UPDATE: From 1 January 2009 I will be logging plays of online Blue Max.  Up to 31 December 2008 I had played 952 games online.  I only log 1 play for Blue Max when I have completed each game.
UPDATE: I've finally raised my rating to a 10 which is well deserved and a recognition of how much I enjoy playing Blue Max every day online at www.youplay.it.

Based on one play: You pilot your plane(s) and try to shoot down the opponent(s). Sounds simple yes, but it is tougher then you would think. You have restrictions on movements, speed and altitude. Also, to target another plane, you must be directly in line with them, so it is much tougher then you think, but when you do get a shot in, it is really painful to the one getting shot, since you can suddenly just get killed, so plan carefully. Play great when each plane is controlled by a different player.

RATING: 5
A simple so-called 'dogfight' game on the 'skating penguins' principle: they move, they got wings, but they ain't flying. The later editions were very attractively produced, and the game was certainly a neat introduction for novices, but the lack of depth meant it had little staying power. If I had to encapsulate in one word: Meh.

This game can be a headache nightmare played on the board, as it can be maximum fun played on line. Rules are too mnemonic and complex and use very very old mechanics, this makes it difficult to play BM with those old small carton pieces. You can play it on http://www.youplay.it . When these problems are surpassed by computers, this game is very fun and dogfights can be hilarous, both when played one against one, and when played in 10 in a very small piece of sky (a real mess!). Don't forget that this game is very far from being any kind of simulator, forget it if you're looking for a real thing.

RATING: 10
Best played with miniatures using the miniatures edition of the game and the updated AMS available online. Those who have mastered Blue Max and seek some more details and complexity should look at "Canvas Eagles" which is based off of Blue Max. The 10 rating is a result of years of playing (started in 1989) and I'm comparing this game to all other WW1 air games out there for ease of play and of course the fun factor. Blue Max is one of the few WW1 air games that is ideal for conventions were you always have new players.

RATING: 8
Feels a bit like RoboRally in which players simultaneously "program" how their airplane will move, except there are no program cards dealt out: the maneuvers you're allowed to perform are dependent on your last maneuver.

However, it's far more interactive than RoboRally since the point of the game is to shoot down your opponents.

The combat resolution system is hilarious.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
WWI air-to-air game of choice. Plotted movement is perfect, and the combat system is just crunchy enough. Great balance between detail and playability, particularly when combined with additional aircraft from the Canvas Eagles rules. Components hold up amazingly well after 30 years--big counters with excellent art.

RATING: 8
Mechanically this game is much better than its descendants of Wings of War/Glory and X Wing/Attack Wing.  Pulling the damage chits and getting some novel hits that reduce your capabilities in different ways is very cool - and that fact that your opponents don't know what's wrong with your plane. Hex based movement is just a lot cleaner than placing the cards or movement strips on the board in later games, and planes in the same hex is done better here.  However, the combat in Blue Max is still quite fiddly - adding up the hit total on the chart is a bit tedious, as well as having to keep track of tailing and firing every turn for checking modifiers.  I decided to create house rules for a very simplified battle chart, where you just check range, if you are currently tailing the target (after movement, not before), if your speed is 3+, and if you are directly facing the target - depending on these, the target pulls X Red and Blue chits. No rolling the die, no adding up modifiers, no burst decisions/gun jamming.

IMHO the best paper and cardboard game of WWI dogfighting ever made. The only wargame my friend and I ever got our wives to willingly play with us. Easy rules, good straight forward mechanics, the best looking oversize aircraft counters in the hobby. This game supplanted Richthofen's War as our lunchtime game at work. On weekends we would end up playing deep into the keg... er, night - "Just one more!" We'd have these going on the side between moves in larger games. Just writing about it makes me want to pull it out again. Sadly, however, computer games handle air warfare much better, and I'm afraid the only person that I can get to play this game anymore might be my wife.

So, here's my experience from one game. We played a couple of turns and realized that it's really hard to line someone up in your crosshairs. I got off one shot, and there were so many negative combat modifiers that I didn't hit anything. Then, my brother and I ended up heading straight for each other. We both shot and both drew pilot kills. Game over (at least for us, anyway). In its favor, individual turns are fairly short.

I play this online at youplay.it.

Apparently the version I play the the 1st edition so I haven't tried the altitude rules. I may not know exactly how the game is set up either but the gameplay and variety is very good. There is a good balance between the skill and the luck factors. I have seen myself gravitate back to the simple rules from the advanced to keep the special damages out and let the game focus on the skills of the pilots. The special damages can really limit your plane and even simply kill you a bit too quickly killing the fun at times. Lots of variety in planes and matchups. Very good game overall.

This game can be fun, specially with a large number of players. But as there are practically no heights (height is incorporated as an optional rule, but in a much simplified way), do not expect it to be a detailed simulation. 

Anyway, if you are looking for an easy-to-learn air combat game that can accomodate a large number of players (even novice ones), this can be your game. For this purpose it is better than its "advanced version", the miniatures game Canvas Eagles, slightly more complex.

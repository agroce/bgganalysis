Good fun. A tighter version of 6 Nimmt and more interesting due to penalty cards coming back into your hand as well as onto the table in front of you.

A must have for any 6 nimmt! fan. It's quite an accomplishment that such an amazing game with 6 players was able to be translated into an equally amazing game with 3-4.

Played at BGG.con 2016.  The "X row" is a nice wrinkle to the game, where you have an opportunity to avoid taking points if you can construct it carefully.  Also, taking cards back into your hand and then ending the round when someone plays her last card is a change that works.  Overall, an enjoyable variation.

RATING: 8
I think this one works better for lower player counts than 6 nimmt does. It also plays more quickly, just over 2 rounds instead of the 66 points rule. The X row is a nice touch and it actually adds an extra element that you must manage well or else you'll get many more points. Another interesting thing is that all but one of the cards you take during the game are added to your hand. Thus, you can try and remember what cards players have picked up. 

Overall, I would prefer to play this over 6 nimmt if I ever have less than 5 people.

RATING: 7
Two plays. I can't really rate this very low, because it's the same basic game as 6 Nimmt which I adore. It's certainly not a bad game at all. Everyone having their own row of cards is a nice twist that I enjoyed. But I don't feel like it'll have a tonne of staying power. It's not the raucous event that 6 Nimmt with many players is for me, and there are many games in this category (2-4p "cards with numbers" games) that I would probably choose to play over this (for example, 3 sind eine zu viel). Heck, 6 Nimmt with four players isn't a bad game at all!

Short answer: It's good, but kind of unnecessary. No need to try to hard to find a copy.

I really enjoy this addition to the Nimmt! series. It captures some of the same zany card play, but with fewer players. I like how previously played cards can end up back in your hand and extend the game. This gives you some knowledge of what cards are out there and who's holding them, thereby creating some more strategic decisions. It gets tense when you're down to those final 1-2 cards and the round doesn't always end when you think it will.

10/6/17 - finally got to play a 4er game of this 2er - 4er twist on 6 Nimmt (a game I love). If you take a row of cards now it adds a layer of decision making which is tough at times

This is an excellent, quick game, with such simple rules, yet gives players some good decision making. I much prefer this to 6 nimmt!

It's a simple, quick filler with some light tactics and double think. I love simultaneous selection and it's nice to have a sort of intro to the mechanism. The X row allows for some nice push-your-luck and it's super fast! It's probably the best game out there that starts with X, so I'm happy to have it just to complete the alphabet.

Even better than 6 nimmt! since the game ends when one player lays his last card and by the idea of avoiding minus points by the X-line.

This is a variation on the classic Kramer card game by Richard Staupe. The four lines of cards of identical length are replaced by 3 lines with lengths of 3, 4, and 5. When you are forced to take a line (which you do more frequently with shorter lines), you add one card you collect to a personal "X" line in front of you and add the others to your hand. The "X" line follows the same rules as other lines (numbers must be ascending) except that it can be any length. If you ever have to add a card to it and you cannot add a higher number, then the entire "X" line gets put into a score pile and a new line is started with the card you added. When one player runs out of cards, you score points for cards left in your hand and you score DOUBLE for cards in your score pile. Cards in the "X" line do not count against you.

There is a lot more hand management in this version of the game, and it also seems harder to get your low number cards played without risking big penalties from your "X" line. It plays fine and it is enjoyable, but I did find the play options a bit too restrictive for my tastes. In most situations, 6 nimmt! gives you more options on a turn. While I do think this plays a bit better at a lower player count, I don't think that's compelling enough for me to get a copy for myself.

RATING: 6
I have played a LOT of [thing=432][/thing]!* As you descend into the madness of that game you pick up a lot of tricks, learn to predict what others will do, and generally become better at managing what appears at first to be utter chaos. 

X Nimmt! turns a lot of these lessons on their head while at the same time keeping the core rules of its predecessor. It's hard for me to judge what depths lay ahead, what interesting tricks are needed to stave off disaster in this new incarnation of the game.

One thing that bothers me is that as you play rounds of X Nimmt! you slowly start to learn which cards are in play, since cards can return to player's hands. So there is an element of memory which I don't like for two reasons. Firstly, I just don't care for memory as a game mechanism. Secondly, and more importantly, I don't want a super light game like this getting bogged down with players struggling to optimize based on all the information they've been gaining. 6 Nimmt! is a fast and fun game of risk management. X Nimmt! runs the risk of turning up the strategy knob a little too high, still quite low but high enough to drown out the fun.

Maybe my fears are unwarranted, time will tell. For now I rate it 6.

*I'm excited about how much "6 Nimmt!" I've played. I'm not talking about the variant titled "6 Nimmt!!".**

**This variant which I am just now creating changes the game by having the cards resolve in order of the most bulls, and if tied the lowest number. Beware of playing cards into a row the 55 could enter [c]:)[/c]

You can teach an old dog new tricks. My initial impression is that this is the best in the series. The lower player count is a bit of a drag, but it makes the game feel less chaotic. Tension is still present due to the reduced size of the card rows. The addition of the X-row adds a push-your-luck element and a level of decision making that is absent from the original game. A great design.

I love the original, this one tries to make it work for fewer players and the X row initially seemed like a nice twist, but overall it didn't really translate that well into the lower playercount for me. :(

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I play a lot of card games with my dad and son and it'd been a while since I brought out a new one. I had played 6 Nimmt! and enjoyed it, so when I found out about a version designed specifically for lower player counts I bought a copy. X Nimmt! is an excellent redesign of a classic that manages to add a bit more tension and strategy into the game. 

You now have the opportunity to place cards you take into the "X" row which will not score points at the end of the round. Of course you have to manage the cards you place in that row; as soon as you take a card that isn't in ascending order of the cards already in the row you must take all of those cards and put them face down in a pile. The card just played starts your new "X" row and the cards in the face down pile count for double!

Games are played over two rounds which will typically wrap up in 15 to 20 minutes. We all enjoyed the game and while my dad and I struggled to figure out the strategy of the game my son cruised to a pair of victories. I've only played with three, but I think it'll play equally well with two or four. As of now there isn't a US publisher, but there are some shops that have had it in stock if you're interested.[/i]

[Amigo 2016 edition] {simultaneous-action; optimal 4p} Finally, there looks a good variant since Take 5.  This game is more tactical than ordinary Take 6.  Players have much more control about the game and can do many tricks to win the same.

Love it.

6 nimmt revisited. The main differences being that when you pick up, one card goes into your "safe row" while the others go into your hand. If you can't add to your safe row, then the previous safe row gets cleared (& will count as double the penalty points). Since players will have a different number of hand cards, cards left in hand count as penalty points and as the round end grows closer, there's more pressure to risk playing the painful had cards. Knowing some of the cards players have kept in hand also complicates matters.

tl;dr: mind bending variation

[thing=432][/thing] has been around for over 20 years and is regarded as a classic with good reason. This game takes the same mechanism, but adds a step between the taking of cards and the adding of the cards to your score pile. And the result is great. It adds a lot of new things to keep in mind and strategically playing a low card to take a row is now a much more important aspect of the game since you not only have to look at the bull heads on the cards, but also their value.
So I would recommend this. It's different enough!

This does play better at lower play counts and the addition of the X row adds something extra to think about, which is a good thing in my books. Overall though the Nimmt games are a bit too light and random for me.

RATING: 6
Like 6 nimmt!, you guess which card is going to get you killed least, and hope for the best. The two-tier, buffered punishment is an interesting idea that adds a little more suspense, and the rows being different lengths is kind of interesting. Still, the subtitle of the game easily could be, "SURPRISE!"

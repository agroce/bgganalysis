PnP version with self made counters.

Great introductory gate to wargame world. Hex & counters, CRTs, ZOCs, d6, advances and retreats after combat, artillery, cavalry, terrain, and much more in a small package. 
At the same time a challenging scenario for both sides!
Low density of units.
Playing time: 30-60 minutes.
Resulted in the Napoleon at War series of games: (Eylau, Marengo, Leipzig, Napoleon Last battles).

This simplistic rendition of Waterloo should be given credit, I suppose, for introducing people to the wargame industry; going by some of the posts on this board, it apparently did just that.  However, I'd already been playing wargames for about 7 years by the time this game appeared--I believe it came out in about '71 or somewhere in there--and so I was quite bored and indeed frustrated by so simple a treatment of Waterloo.  It WAS my first Waterloo game, however, and it triggered in me fantasies of a future monster treatment on the subject.  Sure enough, Wellington's Victory followed within a few years, and filled that vacuum.

RATING: 7
There's a lot more in this little game than I expected.  I've only solo'd it and that was only one time, so take it with a grain of salt, but I was impressed.

Simple rules -- infantry, cavalry, artillery.  Everything has range 1 except artillery that has range 1 or 2.  Everything has strength and movement ratings and only one unit per hex.  The only terrain features are impassable forests and double defense buildings.  The first person to kill 40 strength points of enemy units wins (although the French also have to exit 7 units off the top of the map).  On your turn, you move as many units as you like and then attack.  Attacks are resolved via strength ratios and a single CRT printed on the board.  Results are: defender eliminated, attacker eliminated, defender retreats, attacker retreats, and equal eliminated.  One attacker can advance after combat.

And that's about it.  Sounds simple?  It does EXCEPT for two things I skipped.  The Prussians show up in Round 3 and if the French aren't careful, they'll be fighting a two front battle.  The second thing, and the reason I really like this game, is the rule "everything that can be attacked must be attacked".  So if you surround a unit to mess it, but one of your units is adjacent to a different unit (and none of your other units are), you may find yourself fighting a 1:1 or worse battle and not being able to use that unit for what you intended to.  It makes for some interesting movement decisions and moves this into a game I really want to get played more.

I've got the 1971 magazine edition.  Simple components and short play time.  I actually stuck it in my W1815 folio so I've got two short Napoleonic games together any time I'm looking for a quickie.

Folder 13. 

Interesting game but hard to see how the French can lose. It's pretty easy to demoralize the Brits. I'll definitely use it to start my son off on proper wargaming :)

French must attack on their left and center to be successful. A screening force in the right will ill keep the British honest - if the screening force is 3 or 4 cavalry the Brits cannot ignore them or they can ride around the British army and exit easily. While the Brits are tied down with that force you hit them with all you've got on the left and center. 

One thing to try next as the Brits is to strongly reinforce Hougomont. Maybe that would tie the French down long enough to get the Prussians into play.

Over 20 plays. I love the NAW system. Wish there were more scenarios. I love the playability, and the subtlety built into the rules. With the risk of exchanges at higher odds, you're generally better of thinking about maneuver, creating hammer anvil situations at 1:1. Granted the simulation limits, I choose playability.

This is a great introductory hex-and-counter wargame that will still offer strategic depth and interesting decisions to veterans of the genre -- all wrapped up in a fairly short play time.  

I've played dozens of times, both solo and with human companionship, and I still love trying new strategies and approaches.  Variants included in the rule book allow for options to keep things fresh even when the base game starts to feel repetitive.

At the time of this writing, this is available as a free print-and-play, and that availability as well as the accessibility to new wargamers factors heavily into my score.  

This is an amazing "gateway" wargame, where newcomers and veterans can come together on equal footing and experience equal enjoyment.

RATING: 6.5
It serves its function perfectly - it is a great game to introduce non-wargamers to wargaming. Its beauty is that there are only small forces for each side so it is easy for new-comers to deal with a smaller-than-normal number of decisions-per-turn for this type of game.

For a quite old game this plays great. There is tension due to the victory conditions - a draw is a possibility.

Nothing extraordinary, but it's an excellent introduction to wargaming. Newbies to the hobby would be hard pressed to find a better starting point than this.

But it might not be terribly satisfying to a serious wargamer, as there is nothing revolutionary here.

Solid old-school war gaming downloaded as a free print and play and made as a magnetic set for periodic play.  The "sticky" zones of control and constant trying to turn the opponent's flanks feel true to period.  Game is relatively simple (its strength), although it would have perhaps benefited from step losses on the CRT but these became common only after the game was written.  One I've played 4-5 times already and will keep coming back to.

The 2014 Decision Games edition adds two what if? scenarios to the basic game, giving more bang for the buck over the earlier editions.

I like this introductory level war game because in the number of times I have played it, the French and Allied sides have both won about the same number of times.  This is the sign of a well-thought-out game.

I printed this out based on the recommendation of many wargame geeklists that said this is a great introductory war game. 

(Until playing this, the only wargame-type games I've played have been Axis and Allies, Memoir 44, Fortress America, Wings of War, Star Wars X-Wing miniatures, Risk. But no actual hex and counter type games).

I really loved it. The mechanics (like ZOC) really captured the feeling of a battle of the era - not that I'm an expert.  The sense of trying to hold a line, breaking through a line, flanking...it was great. The strategy that became apparent was to surround a unit in such a way that retreat wouldn't be a legal move before attacking, hoping for a defender retreat roll, and thus killing a defending unit. Though maybe it'll get tiresome after a while, right now it seems to lead to the possibility of a lot of interesting choices.

While luck was a factor, it never felt like an overwhelming part of the game. 

Clunky, but not terrible, was having to calculate "combat ratios" all the time.  It makes sense to me that modern wargames, from what I hear, have moved away from it.

Also: the game can easily take more than the advertised 1 hour. But it never felt dragged out. 

So, I recommend it as an intro wargame. It's piqued my interest in the genre.

My mate got this as his S&T intro; I got Strike Farce One (sic). Played to death in the 70's. As an intro to wargaming and the concepts of ZOCs, mandatory attacks, etc., it is design genius. You could add some chrome to pep it up a bit, but that would miss the point. The artillery provides a bit of a combined arms feel, but the cavalry could do with being differentiated a little better. I do feel sorry for the 1-4 in Hougomont which cannot fail to be eliminated on Turn 1 every time.

RATING: 7.5
The best game to introduce a friend to wargaming hobby. 4 pages of rules and straight to the battle.

It will be also an acceptable simulation if we change following rules:

- buildings block artillery same as woods, because they blocks the line of sight;

- in woods-road hexes, combat is permitted only along roads (ZOC still blocks movement).

In this way, Hougoumont ceases to be the usual automatic victory for the French player on 1st turn, and artilleries must finally take into account also the lines of sight.

If you miss "La Belle Alliance", it is hex 1414.

This is an unfair low rating.  Why?  I enjoyed my one complete game of it.  However, my frustration with HexWar.com (or my own computer) has soured me.

I remember as a teenager explaining to a sceptical uncle that this game represented the absolute peak of wargaming realism.  I was, of course, horribly wrong.  

Despite not really bearing any resemblence to Napoleonic warfare, the game *was* a very good tool for recruiting new wargamers.  You could always move on to the brigade version once the basic game had lost its charms (not that it was any more realistic!)

A hex & counter classic. Heck, this may be THE hex & counter classic. I played it a bunch in 2013 via HexWar when I was getting back into wargaming. The way it's boiled down so far, it really starts to feel like chess with dice-based conflict resolution. The map is recognizably Waterloo, as are some other features such as Prussian arrival.

This is a great little game to serve as an introduction to wargames. Simple rules with a low number of counters that can be played quickly all come together with a Napoleonic theme. No attempt at a real simulation but this is a lot of fun. Great stuff!

Downloaded free version, mounted counters, took color copy of "small map" to local quik-print shop where I had it blown up (to 10 5/8" x 12 1/2") and laminated. The resolution was alright, but the coordinate numbers didn't come out clearly, so I used a dry-erase marker to write out all the coordinates for starting pieces--which is okay, because there are only so many hexes that need to be numbered that way. 

One question about wargames (for the past 40-50 years): Why aren't cardboard counters hexagon-shaped? It's like fitting a square into a hexagon.... I cut my home-made counters to fit into the hexes.

Quick and fun to play. Yes, an excellent game to introduce wargaming to others, particularly young persons. At the same time, the basics can be applied to so many other, more complex war games of this type.

My first wargame played: I can remember well being taught the mechanics by a guy who would become a best friend.

This remains a game that presents a tense and interesting play.  It is cleaner than SPI's Austerlitz and Borodino games with the same system, and I think NaW has modestly stood the test of time well.

Nice looking, simple, and small introductory wargame on a non-American battle most Americans have heard about.  This system was used in another 100 (?) SPI games, the Quads in particular.  Dense lines require tactical finesse that will elude the new wargamer.  And the EX results can produce some trades that will cause dismay in the novices.

RATING: 8
This used to be the introductory game when you subscribed to S&T. I found it to be a good wargame example - simple yet historical enough to wet your appetite. 
While the different unit types act similarly there are enough differences to capture some of the combined arms components. Artillery can reach out and also be a soak off for attacks, infantry is slow but the heavy hitter. Cavalry is fast but weak. 
Primarily the games are a shoving match until you can begin to surround units.
Later games of the series began to treat higher level formations - which helps the system.

I wonder if some of the simple command and colors games like Memoir '44 can replace it.

The upside:

- The art is not that appealling.
- Can be a little longish than I would like for this kind of game.

Actually, there is more play in this simple game than meets the eye. The game favors the French, but the Brits make some important choices that might force the issue. Each turn can be a nailbiter.Good introductory game, and opens up lots of potential games with just a hair more detail: specifically, all the Napoleon games from SPI, the Blue and the Grey games, and from there it is only a short step to a majority of SPI's games.

Two half-played games of this, I just can't seem to want to finish it. Another example of a wargame being too... simple? This, like Battle of the Bulge, to me, seems to be move my chit next to your chit, do math, roll die, consult chart, I win/lose. I realize this is designed specifically for beginners. I'm relatively new to hex and counter games, but I've been playing meaty games for 30+ years. I'm hoping I just haven't found the hex/counter game that speaks to me.

The original giveaway introductory game sent to S&T subscribers back in the early days of the magazine. Subsequently replaced by the even simpler Strike Force One.
The NaW system was the foundation of the early Napoleonic wargames published by S&T, and also served as the basis for the Blue and Gray series, along with most of the SPI Quadrigames - though heavily modified in the later games.
This was a nice filler game that could be played by a couple of experienced gamers in 30-60 minutes.

Not something I would play today so my rating is mainly based on it's place in time. It's actually a pretty decent wargame given the standards of the day and it does the job as introduction to the hobby, more or less. Rules are clean, set up is easy and playtime is fast. The strategy is not very interesting and the thinking is more mathy than military. As an introduction however, it actually brings up more wargame questions such as: if it makes sense to garrison La Haye st. with a 1-4 why not do that everywhere? Why cant you breakdown units? How do you simulate a position that you dont know the strength of?

RATING: 9
‘Napoleon at Waterloo’ (‘NaW’ or ‘N@W’) is a training game for introducing novices to hex-&-counter wargaming.  It is, in the AASGC categorization scheme, a ‘low-resolution, historically/scientifically accurate simulation model’.  In other words, it’s very simple but elegantly depicts some important truths while serving to accomplish the very important training function.  In fact, as it was in 1971, so it remains today: a micro-marvel of practical perfection.  It captures enough of the fundamental aspects of tactical warfare in the Napoleonic era and of the basic principles of hex-&-counter wargaming to fulfill its purpose admirably.  For AASGC, it is our de rigueur transition lever from plastic-piece multiplayer strategy games to true wargaming.

NaW’s order of battle, unit capabilities, and map features are accurate enough to fulfill the game’s purposes.  The rigid, active ZoCs typical of SPI/DG folios & ’quadrigames’ capture some of the rigidities and challenges of linear warfare.  Moreover, the morale rules capture the tendency of armies to fight until they break and then suffer rapid, cascading entropy.  As was the case historically, Napoleon must make a clear, prompt decision as to whether to attack left, right, or center, and if he chooses to attempt to turn the Anglo-Dutch left, he must screen to delay the Prussian arrival.

Here, as so often elsewhere, Dunnigan found the perfect balance between ‘realism and playability’ so as to enable the game to fulfill its simulation purposes – in this case, to train novices on hex-&-counter basics without overloading them with detail and show them how wargaming can simulate history.  NaW poses the aforementioned operational-level challenge to the French, while tactical execution thereafter allows numerous opportunities to mass forces while economizing elsewhere, count odds, add artillery, and employ diversionary suppression and flank attacks (ZoC-blocked prevention of retreat).  These basic hex-&-counter tactics can be surprisingly difficult for novices to grasp.

Some students like hex-&-counter gaming more than others; however, in general, NaW is highly engaging because the scale is manageable while the problems are both challenging yet potentially solvable.  The game is exciting, especially as Napoleon tries to overturn the Anglo-Dutch line while the Prussians rush to the rescue.  The issue often hangs in the balance until late in the day, and it is not unusual for a single local late-afternoon fight to determine the outcome by sending one or the other army into demoralization.

I no longer have the original NAW for comparison, but the 1979 version seems smaller.  Not just the map, but the game seems shorter as well.  Napoleon has only two turns to do anything before the Prussians show up directly on his flank.

Designed as an intro to wargaming SPI style, with a single folded sheet of fairly short rules, it still functions pretty well as an intro to old-fashioned, "I go, you go", counter-pushing, soakoff-here-for-3:1-there wargames.

The battle itself, as portrayed here, is mostly devoid of strategic interest: can the Allies hold out long enough for the Prussians to arrive and save the day?  That's it.  Slug it out (for about 2 hours) to find out.

Don't bother with the "advanced" version; it just adds more counter density and stacking for more complicated soak-off calculations, adding another hour to this game.  Yawn.  Instead, move on to a more interesting game.

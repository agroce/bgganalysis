Great game in a tiny box.  First session and we played 7 games back to back.  Works well as a gambling game, we played it at 3p (6 cents) per point and that was okay.  Everybody loved the game, even the guy who lost the most cash!

generally hate decimal scores, but since I've only played it in one session, so I'm a little loathe to give it a 10 -- yet.  However, I can't imagine it won't go up.  Its a great simple auction game.  It has light tension everywhere you look and it ends before the lightness gets dull.

Custom print and play version. I enjoy this one as a dead-simple filler, but I think that it may ultimately be pushed out by Deep Sea Adventure and Palago. Even so, it's a cute little game with very light decisions and a quick play time.

RATING: 9
For something so simple, this is really clever.  One of the essential fillers.  I like the way that you have to strike a balance between playing your own game (to minimise your points) and watching how you can hurt others or stop them from gaining too much.  But, oh those cards!  Given that they tacked on a theme to an essentially mathematical abstract, couldn't they have given us some cards with nuclear waste cylinders on and maybe a nuclear bomb for card 35?  It really would have helped the colour of the game.

What's more, I play this a lot, and everytime that I do, I want to play it more and more.  Have therefore raised this from an 8 to a 9.  It may get to a 10 one day.  Great game for the price.

5-21-11 - Well, we pulled this one out for a quick play after some heavier games the other day, and ended up playing about 7 rounds, lol. With a little bit of table talk, this one becomes a lot of fun. Doesn't change my ranking, and even tho I will rarely be the one to recommend it, I really do enjoy this one every time I play it.

This one still maintains a high score, it's just a quick, fun game.

Better than average card game, but nothing too special. It didn't have the kind of depth that I'm looking for, and the cards lacked any interesting artwork. If I'm going to play a sequenced card game, I'll definitely stick with Lost Cities.

RATING: 7
It is fast and fun, a good filler with very easy rules and a good dose of push your luck. It reminds me of a mix between Parade and For Sale, as you manage to make less points possible, like in Parade, but you have a "bid" system that eat your coins not to take the cards and push your luck in getting sets of cards that doesn't harm you. Pretty good game.

Can't believe this is a game that so many people liked and talked about by famous reviewers.

So I bought it, tried it. Tried it with a different group. Different age. Different timing.......

Can't say anything more than just an exercise of taking cards or putting down a token as being fun. 

The calculation of the score after the game was even more annoying.....up to the level of extreme hatred. Coupled with minus points from tokens made it even worst....no one else cared if anyone won or lost....

No thanks.....it's out the window as garbage.....

Great little filler game with very simple rules that players can just sit down and play.  Despite most people being a little mixed on the game after the first play, it has quickly become a favourite in my gaming group.

Extremely quick filler game.  Games can last as little as 5-10 mins!  It is a semi-"push your luck" type game, where players pass off point chips to not take cards.  If you take the card you get points for the card, but if you pass off all of your chips, you are forced to take the next card (which may be worth more points!).

No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.

The rules are simple. Each turn, players have two options:

play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card

pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card

However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pros
- Simple. You make one of two choices and that's it!
- Easy to teach and a fun press your luck
- Short filler and can actually play six people if you'd like
- Hidden coin info gives end game suspense
- Variations online with how you play the game

Cons
- Lack of theme, but it's not a big deal for a short game

It's very fun game indeed, the tension where we all put a chip for a card and guessing when will someone take it?  Should I take it?  Not bad not bad :)  

One part I enjoy the most is when I have a high card (like 33), and a high card (like 34) come out, because I know that no one will take it except for me who has a link.  So I just keep watching people putting chips on it and I'm going to take them all later! hahaha

Finally got around to playing this classic.  I can see why it is liked.  There is a certain simple elegance to the design.  But for my tastes, it seemed too simplistic and predictable.  I guess sometimes the decisions are just too easy for me in a game.  In this one, simplicity and luck factoring in, conspired to underwhelm me with the gameplay.  I don't feel like I want to play it again, so have to give it a 6 at best.

{1 play, 4 players} [inital rating: 6.5] Fast, fun, light, different.  It won't rock your world - it's no For Sale - but then again it plays in half the time!

For a simple game, this game is great fun with a larger group.  And it also helps you learn a lot about your friends.  Are they conservative?  Do they lie?  Are they completely reckless wildcards?  You'll find out with this game.  Easy to teach, easy to play.  I hold onto this one just because it's one to whip out after thanksgiving dinner with the family (who mostly are not gamers) and say "let's play something".  It was awesome to see the gloves come off as the passes went around the circle and the gems became scarce.  I did replace the cardboard chits that came with mine with aquarium beads, I think it's adds a cool additional layer of tactile feedback - totally fun to slam down a bead to stay in the bidding.  Boom!  Good pub game, too.  At this price point, get it.

Los buenos juegos de cartas tambien pueden ser simples: o pagas una ficha o tomas la carta junto con todas las fichas que tenga encima. Cualquiera puede tomar esa decision, ¿verdad?  Pero ¿que pasaria si nadie quiere las cartas porque dan puntos negativos? Las cartas están numeradas del 3 al 35, en que cada carta te da tantos puntos negativos como el numero impreso en ella. Las escalas de 2 o más cartas solo cuentan con el menor numero de ella, pero 9 cartas son removidas del mazo al inicio por lo que puede ser difícil hacer las conecciones. ¿Y las fichas? Dan un punto positivo c/u pero son escasas, muy escasas.

This is a light and quick card game that is easy to teach.  The deck includes cards numbered from 3 - 35.  Each hand, 9 are randomly removed.  Each player starts with 11 points.  Each round a single card is revealed and players eitehr take it into their hand or pass.  To take a card you simply pick it up.  To avoid the card, you give up one of your points.  Plays continues until someone takes the card. When you take a card, you also get the points that others placed on it.  Hands are scored based on the cards taken.  Points 'won' equal the sum of the cards unless you have sequential cards - in which case you ignore the higher valued cards in the series.  Winner is the player with the lowest score.  Overall, a fun light filler or opening game.  [GTI: AGCL]

I was late to the party on this one, but it's another of those 'must have' little card games, with simple but addictive set collection mechanics and a very primal bidding element.

A nice push your luck game.  How much are you willing to make others sweat?  Each game takes 5-10 minutes.  If you play with a crowd that likes fun, table talk and bluffing this is a lot of fun.  Nice opener or closer.  Plays well with 3 or 4.

A game of relative value, really. When a card comes to you, you either take it, or put a 1-point chip on it and pass it to the next player. The key to advanced play is realizing when you'll be able to send a card around the table and have it come back to you with 3 new chips on it - if you were going to take the card anyway, you just scored 3 VP for free.

This is a fun game, but it really doesn't get any play at all at our house. There are just too many other games that we'd rather play.  Strangely enough, if the cards had pictures of robots or ninjas or dinosaurs on it, I'm sure we'd play it more.

RATING: 7.5
The ultimate game in terms of simplicity (take the card or put a chip on it), but there is so much more going on here. The game has a push your luck mechanic, which is great. The fact that you remove certain numbers sight unseen at the beginning of the game makes trying to get a run of numbers a risky move. You can put a chip on a card you really want, knowing that no one else will take it and you will get it with more chips on it. Fascinating game that I will always play.

p: not found anyone yet who didn't get gripped by this utterly simple but develishly clever set collecting/avoiding game. Judging when to take and when to give, manipulating other player's chip-pool, and all spiced up by a bit of gambling when it comes to collecting sets with missing numbers as some sequences do simply no longer exist. Excellent!

An ideal game to introduce non-gamers and family-members-of-many-ages to a world outside Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit. It's a simple card game, everyone knows numbers, everyone can collect sequences, everyone has 10 minutes to play, and as long as people are aware of the result of getting caught out with no chips to pass the buck (you'll mop up cards in a bad way), everyone can play and win.

Fun filler game that plays quickly and easily with larger player counts.  You are trying to finish with the lowest score based on the card total you take minus your chips.  Either take the card or pay a chip (no thanks).

Great filler! Has overtaken For Sale's position as best filler IMO. Strategy seems to be to get a nice low spread like 5, 10, 15 and to keep as many chips as possible. Though its nothing like poker, the chips lend a poker like tactility to the table activity.

RATING: 8
This is one of those games that has that "why didn't someone think of this sooner" feel to it.  I mean the basic mechanism is so jaw-droppingly simple that it almost feels like common sense that this game would exist.  I love the fact that the game is so simple to teach, and yet offers some really tense and interesting decisions every time you play.

I think what makes the game work, though is the rule where you only score for the lowest card in a run.  This creates those moments where you will have a card visible that won't hurt you in the slightest, but you can use it to push your luck and try to milk your opponents out of chips.  Every game works out differently because of the random cards that are removed, and because each player will play in a slightly different way.  For a fast little game like this, it's impossible to ask much more.

Give a chip or take the card (with the chips).  That's the only decision, but it's still never easy.  Fits very well into the great filler category!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Filler game with extremely easy rules (even easier than For Sale) yet slightly more apparent depth.

I say "apparent" depth because it takes only ten or so plays (not much, for a game so short) before luck almost completely overtakes skill in determining the winner.  The order that the cards appear in the deck, as well as the identity of the missing cards, can and often do make the difference between resounding victory and crushing defeat.

For example, if you take the 34 card early in the game and the 35 and 33 never appear, you will lose.  I'm not kidding: YOU WILL LOSE.  If, on the other hand, the 33, 32, and 35 all come out, in that order, you will rake in a ton of chips and you'll never have to take another card all game.  No one will be able to stop you from winning unless they thoroughly screw themselves over -- and that just adds a decidedly unpleasant king-making element to the game.

RATING: 6.5
--------------------------------------------------------
Quick Rules:
An ultra quick game where players are trying to get the lowest score. Each player is given 11 little red tokens, each worth -1 points. The deck of cards contain the numbers 2-35, before the game starts you pitch 9 cards out. The start player then flips over the top card and the game begins. Each player has two options on their turn; 
1.)Say "No Thanks" and add a red token onto the card, passing play to the next player.
2.)Take the card(and any coins on it) adding that number to their score.
The big rub of the game is that point cards are stack able as long as they are consecutive. So if you have the 18 and the 19 comes out, you can grab the 19 and put it behind the 18, taking on no more points.
------------------------------------------------------
This game is pretty good. It's not one that's going to hurt your brain to think about, but it's also not going to take much time if all to play. For me, even though it's not that challenging it rarely seems to overstay it's welcome.

This game does sometimes have a problem with kingmakers. So there are times when people decide they don't want you to win so if the 27 is out and they see you have the 28 and the 26 they'll take it just so you can't have it. Those people are dicks and you probably shouldn't play games with them anyway. Don't blame the game because your friend's are jerks, get new friends.

This is an excellent filler or starting/ending game.  It is quick and easy to teach.  It's reverse bidding mechanic - Don't want that card, you have to pay not to take it - is neat and fun.  It was a big hit with my gaming group.  It is light enough that children (6 and up) can play and hold their own.  Though it is quick and light there is enough strategy to satisfy.  It was a surprise and it a lot of fun.

Awesome filler with incredibly simplistic rules. Tons of fun waiting to see how many times around one high card that's wanted by one person will go before someone else caves in to prevent them from getting all the chips. Works great with 3, 4, or 5. Also works great with chips public or hidden, though they make for very different games.

A fun game that holds a special place in this coder's heart as I implemented a command line version of this game in Erlang when I was learning that language.  The niggle of the hidden but trackable chip count is not enough to dissuade me from recommending this title as an appetizer to nearly any game night.  I like the thrill of gambling, the high of chip farming, the threat of sabotage and the desperation behind the pleads to avoid sabotage.

A really neat "press your luck" card game. If you like James Earnst's coin-exchanging game called Pennywise/Fight, you may enjoy this one as well. IMO, there's an odd similarity to that game, but the effect is in "reverse". Rather than contributing a coin and perhaps taking lesser valued ones away, you are instead submitting lessor-valued coins in turn until someone agrees to take the high-value "coin" offered.

// Very light set collection/bidding. Getting a ton of

getting a card that you really didn't need (or want)?

I actually enjoy this game.  My family however, does not.  In fact, my wife detests it.  3 out of 4 family members equals a non-playable game equals a 1 rating in reality.  I do have one more complaint; we played it wrong the first time through.  Looking online for rules clarification I saw I was not the only person who misinterpreted the rules as they pertain to how a turn actually works.  The necessary information to play properly IS in the rules, but it's not laid out in a very intuitive way.

Nice and simple filler. If you don't want to take a card (which count against you) then you have to place a chip on it to avoid taking it into your pile. Counters score for you and you have to take some cards to get more counters. The trick is in working out who will have to crack and when as the counters are kept hidden. Neat mechanic.

I now own a deck of this having printed out the cards at ArtsCow and gaining a load of small counters from mini connect 4!

A very fun card game that is dead easy to teach.  Like Slide-5, I wish there was a built-in multi-round score track somehow, but finding a paper and pencil is usually a pretty easy thing to come by.  I love watching players take cards that deliberately hurt them, just because they think the same card will help another player... in the end, any card taken is typically a bad card and the screw-your-neighbor card taking usually ends up being screw-yourself ;-)  This is a FUN game.

Fun, light, easy-to-learn family game with a perfect "push your luck" element that makes the game. The best moments are when you want to take a card, but also want some extra tokens, so you pass the card around just one... more... time... and someone steals it. Lots of laughs.

Easy to teach, loads of fun to play with the right crowd.  This is a real gem.  I could play this game for hours.  We played it with Category 5 cards, and getting the official version seems to be more of a pain than it's worth currently.  I definately recommend this if you like Category 5, Coloretto, or even High Society.

RATING: 8.5
This is a fun, light, quick game. I've played it now perhaps 50  times and I still enjoy it. This is one of those games you can introduce to anyone and it will get a great reception. Very enjoyable angst when your turn comes around to either take the card or fork out from your quickly dwindling supply of chips.
RULES: We had played this game wrong for a long time, and after playing by the proper rules decided our way was MUCH better. When you take a card, it shouldn't be your turn again, but should pass to the next person. That is how we play and it makes for a much better game.

This was not a hit for me.  Simple, easy to play...I don't think its fun.  Maybe I just don't get it (this is certain as I never, NEVER win).  Everyone else likes to play and it seems to be on the table a lot when I'm not around.  It should probably be ranked higher but Personally I have to be "forced" to play it.

RATING: 5
This continues its decline in my esteem. Plusses: it's very short and simple, you can play with anyone, and it generates some tension. Minuses: There is almost no game here at all, and once you realize how little impact your decisions have, the tension drains away. I actually think Geschenkt's big problem is that it takes too long! Your first big decision on when to take a middling to high value card basically decides your game, based on what is in the deck and what isn't and what order it comes out, but it just takes too long to play out. Of course, it's not a large time in absolute value, but the game is still too long.
---
I continue to enjoy this, but I do wonder if there is really any game here at all. There are a bunch of interesting decisions that the game throws at you, but the risks are very coarse and the outcome seems often dictated by card flow. Can easily suffer from over-thinking from the gaming crowd. Still, a fun filler and occasional game, I just find it doesn't engage me as much as most people.
---
Great for what it is, non-threatening filler. I've grown tired of it, but it's still decent to bring out when you've got 10-15 minutes and need a hand of something that isn't going to run long. It's got a nice push-your-luck element to it. I've played it enough at this point though that I'd probably rather just chat for 15 minutes if that's all we've got, though.

For a quick, light game with a bunch of normally Non-gamers, this game is probably the best choice.  Easy to explain, easy to understand, and easy to play.

There are many other games I'd prefer to play, but this is the lightest game I know of which I would play again.

RATING: 8
Although I prefer longer games, I give this 8 stars because for how small, inexpensive, and quick it is, it is super fun and not just a total luck fest like many quick games.  Sometimes the cards taken out of each round can hose somebody completely to no fault of their own, which I don't like.  I kinda wish fewer cards were left out.  But I'm sure there's a good reason for how it is.

Anniversary Purchase (5/6/10)

Got it played a month and a half after purchase.  Very fun, very fast little push your luick type game.  The mechanic of skipping a card using chips is so simple and yet kind of appealing because it's trying to figure what that chip is worth to you later in the game (and not just the -1 point at the end) is what can sometimes blow your mind.

Could get annoying with certain people who have AP, but this is still a simple game I am very glad is in my collection. 7/10 (6/21/10)

Still a good filler card game. I think I like For $ale better, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is clever in that taking that first card is always worse, pointwise, than giving a chip, and yet, you have to do it. It's as if the game defies logic. It's also simple to learn and plays quickly.

However, part of the game involves bleeding chips from the other players when a card is harmless for you but bad for them. Which is an uncomfortable part of the game as no one enjoys being bled, and if they don't go along with it, they'll lose.

Strategically, a great move, but it isn't really fun for anyone at the table. Not the people paying out, and not me when I'm doing the bleeding as I don't enjoy the emotions generated during this part of the game.

Great little filler which finishes in like 10 minutes so you can play it when you don't have much time - or you could simply play again when the first game is over, which you're probably going to do as it's quite addicting. 
It is good with 3, 4 and 5 players. I think I actually like it better when not playing with 5 as it can be too hard to control what's going on. 

What I like in this game is when you don't mind getting a card because you have another next to it, but the other players don't, so you send it around a couple of times and make the other players sweat about what to do... It honestly can be a little cutthroat, and there is definitely some meta-gaming involved! Also, while there is obviously some luck of the draw, I've found that the same players often win. This is one of my favorite fillers!

Provisional rating as we've only played it a few times, but so far it seems to have everything one would want in a filler.

It's now a tie for "king of the card fillers" between Coloretto and No Thanks! What a freakin' simple but wonderful game. It's only one choice between play a chip or take a card... but that choice fluctuates greatly depending on the circumstances. You can hurt some feelings with this game (in a good way), and the tension at the table is a great feeling.

This scratches the same itch as all the card games I used to like (hearts, Euchre)... but it scratches that itch much deeper. And unlike those other games, I don't think I'll quickly learn this game to the point where the card choice is automatic. This is a wonderful game.

Dropped this to a "7" -- nothing wrong with the game, but my initial exuberance has diminished a bit. I suppose a filler is inevitably... a filler? Still, kudos for any game that you can successfully introduce to the in-laws. I think the reason for the drop in rating is that I now start to play this on "autopilot," with most choices fairly rehearsed from previous games.

Dropped this down to a "6." The game has hit that auto-pilot type play that I've experienced with Euchre, Hearts, etc. It's a great game to have with non-gamers, but if there's gamers in the midst, I'd rather play other options.

Update: eventually traded this away as a "sweetener" in a math trade. I don't think I'll miss it. For me, the better option for a small package family friendly card game is Coloretto. This became too automatic.

RATING: 8
This card game is an easy-to-explain filler that combines some strategy, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck.  It takes a little getting used to, and takes a couple games to get the feel of the "values" of cards (how much can one milk other players of chips before taking a card?), but it's a good late-night or over-food game.

What a great game. Everybody should own this. It costs less than fish and chips, is smaller than fish and chips and plays in less time than it takes to eat them. And is just as satisfying, especially with a nice cold beer.

RATING: 7.5
Great filler that takes about a minute to teach.

The deck consists of cards numbered 3 to 35.  Nine cards are randomly removed from the game.  The remaining cards are shuffled and placed in the centre of the table.  A player turns up a card and must either take it, or place one of his 11 chips on the table.  This essentially forces the next player to face the same decision.  The second player can now either take the card and chip, or add one of his chips...which would pass play to the third player.  This continues until someone takes the card.  The player who took the card, now turns up the next...and it all begins again until the deck is exhausted.

The face value of each card is considered points...and players want the lowest score to win. But, if players manage to collect a run of cards (such as 24, 25, 26...) the lowest number of the sequence is the only card counted during scoring.  This makes for some serious decision making...knowing that nine cards have been removed. On his turn, if a player has no chips he is forced to take the face up card. Each chip players have during scoring count as -1 point...which helps decrease your final score.

It is fast, simple and easy on non-gamers.  A good part of the fun factor comes from the banter that goes on as players chide and comment on a card no one wants, that someone has to take.  Cheap, fun, fast and easy to learn.  What's not to like from this filler?

Note:  I must confess I have not actually played with the official cards.  We use 6 Nimmt/Slide 5 cards and some bingo chips.  It's all you need.  Update:  The game is so cheap and we play it enough that I did eventually buy it. It is good quality and worth the $9.

It's ok as an ultralight and, thankfully, ultrashort filler. It's true that it manages to create some tension despite its simplistic design. Still, 'For Sale', 'Coloretto' and such are a little more appealing to me as light fillers.

RATING: 7
I was suprised to find that I really enjoyed this game. I'm not generally too excited about a lot of card games. There my not be any good reason, but I found myself comparing Geschenkt to 6 Nimmt!  

I prefer Geschenkt. The thing that makes Geschenkt work is that there are unused cards that no one can account for. You don't have to fear the card-counter quite so much.

The game plays fairly quickly and fluidly...and you know how close to the end you are at all times. As a 5 minute filler, I'd be happy to see this one pulled out at any time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great filler in the right group. People have to "get" the push your luck element of letting it go around one more time. Sometimes a big hit and sometimes falls flat, which is odd, but I continue to try this one out with groups.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Geschenkt is a classic, inoffensive light filler with some tough decisions and more than a modicum of luck. The game is simple: there are a deck of number cards, 3-35 inclusive, and a pile of chips. Each player gets x amount of chips at the start of the game, which varies with the player count. The deck has a number of cards randomly removed from it, and then the game begins. Each round, a card is flipped over, and when a player's turn comes up they can either take the card, or put a chip on it, which then passes the play to the next player. Whoever eventually declines to put a chip on the card places it in front of them, and grabs any chips that have piled up on it. Cards are bad to have at the end of the game though, and the goal is to take as few of them as possible...sort of. There is a hook: if you collect cards that are sequential, only one of them counts against you at the end of the game, so having 26, 27, 28 is much, much better than having 26, 28 alone. Excess chips at the end of the game also help out your score.

The negatives here are that the deck stripping makes it unpredictable as to what is a good card to pick up in many situations. There is very little actual ability to play for the long game here in that sort of sense. On the plus side, the game is extremely short, and the extortion aspect of putting chips on the cards that you can take without penalty, and trying to get the other players to give you more chips in the process, is wonderful...at least if you're an evil hearted bastard, and I am, so this is my kind of filler.

I initially found this slightly annoying and was pretty bad at it. But after lots of games recently I seem to have got the hang of it and have been winning a few hands. I guess it repays repeated play as you get to know what works and what doesn't. Still a simple bidding game but very nuanced and fun and interesting to see how the table reacts to certain cards. More about playing the others than the game, which I like.

RATING: 10
No Thanks! is my favourite small game. A game could not be easier to learn or faster and simpler to play while at the same time being so much fun. No Thanks! is a very basic press your luck mechanism combined with some bluffing and no arbitrary theme forced on it. Each turn takes only a few seconds resulting in almost no downtime at all. The game is explained in 3-5 sentences and has a setup time of about 20 seconds. No matter how reluctant someone is to learn and play a new game (or any game at all), No Thanks! will pull it off. Only 5 minutes left? Still enough time for several games of No Thanks!. It's a great starter or filler game that should not miss in any collection. (This is for the German AMIGO (2004) edition.)

Note:  After 18 plays, I have discovered that I had a rule wrong.  After you take a card, you have to take the next one unless you put a chip on it.  I had played that after you take a card, it passes onto the next person.  Slight difference, but still a difference.

Still a great filler game.

The "passing game". There's only one decision to make each turn, but its surprisingly non-trivial. Trying to milk your fellow players for one more round with a card you can take without penalty is a neat little game of "chicken". Travel sized, easily explained and fast playing, good for non-gamers.

What an awesome little filler!  A hand takes only 10 minutes, it is easier to teach than Coloretto, and I think it is a whole lot of fun.

Everyone's opinion of this game improved markedly when we realized we had been playing one rule wrong.  We had played that, if you took a card, the NEXT player turned up the next one. We didn't realize that the same player turns it up, and keeps turning up cards until they actually put a chip on one.  This seemingly subtle difference actually changes the strategies in the game quite a bit--for the better, in my opinion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The game has one choice, take the card or put a chip on it. This actually turns out to be a pretty tough decision as you don't want any cards, but someone is going to have to take it. It is also so easy that anyone can learn it in one minute.

Very fun quick and light game of lots of player interaction and cleverly understated strategy, enough to keep it interesting, balanced against all of the smack-talking between players as they shaft one another out of sought-after cards and chips.

Although I'm certain I played this once years ago, I approached it with fresh eyes recently.  And this really is a clever little filler game from the push-your-luck genre.

The simple question is how long you hold out from taking a card (and it's point value) before the number of chips on it outweigh the cost?  And as the game progresses, do you hold out hope for completing a run of cards to keep your point total down?

This game won't be for everyone, but with the right light-hearted group, it's good, clean fun.

I think I expected a little more out of No Thanks... I was expecting more Ah-AH! moments actually. We were 3 players for my first 2 games and I think it might be more fun with more players. I was browsing BGG No Thanks' forums and I just found out you can easily play up to 7 players (despite the official rules for max 5 players) so that's very good news. That game works well though, so, time will tell!

EDIT: After playing it about 30 times I can see there's much more strategy involved.

Felt like a great mix of strategy, with interesting choices (go for a run?) evaluations (benefits of the coins vs the card) and strategies (I soon realised that getting a run in the low cards could never be relied upon, since these go quickly.

There's also an excellent mix of second-guessing and luck.

Looking forward to playing more.

Rules are simple, decisions are quick but meaningful. Two layers of risk-taking: will the card (and chips) make it around a second time, or will you be able to create a set so the points don't affect you anyway?

One big question remains. Which is easier to teach: this or Botswana (aka: Loco!)?

No Thanks! has easily become one of my favorite light fillers/card games, and one that I am very glad to have in my game collection. The game is very easy to teach (in less than a minute) to anyone. My grandma with short-term memory issues even grasped this game quickly and had lots of fun. Although the rules are simple and there is quite a bit of luck involved, there are some very interesting decisions to make. I highly recommend this game for anyone who brings games to play with non-gamers!

3-5 jugadors (però a 2 val)
Jo no el tinc com a tal, però es pot jugar amb les cartes 3-35 del 6 Nimmt i 55 fitxes (11 per jugador x 5 jugadors).
Les normes són senzilles:
- Objectiu: fer el menor número de punts possibles (cartes sumen punts, monedes resten punts).
- Mesclar les 33 cartes i descartar-ne 9 a l'atzar. Posar el mazo boca-avall al mig de la taula.
- Es gira una carta. Si la vols, te la quedes. Sinó, poses una moneda damunt. I així consecutivament. La carta va acumulant monedes, i qui s'endugui la carta, se l'endú amb les monedes.
- Si tens un 27 i circula el 26 i l'agafes, al ser consecutiu puntuaràs només la més baixa de "l'escala" que tinguis.

Er ligt een kaart open. Ofwel neem je de kaart en scoor je minpunten ofwel neem je de kaart niet en leg je een chip naast de kaart. De waarde op de kaart bepaalt je aantal minpunten. Als je een ketting kan vormen (bijvoorbeeld: 12, 13, 14, 15 en 16), dan telt enkel de waarde van de laagste kaart van de rij (12 in dit voorbeeld) als minpunt. Wie het minste minpunten heeft, wint Gesjaakt.

Sort of the reverse of For Sale, you're bidding to avoid the card.

The great thing about this game is that with almost no rules and very few components it offers angst, joy, contempt and despair. I exaggerate a little but if you have played it you will know what I mean. 

It's simplicity however is both it's main strength and it's major weakness. There does not seem to be much real depth to the experience so its replay value suffers. Great ride while it lasts though.

Quality fast playing filler.  Cards numbered 3 to 35 (with some secretly discarded) are offered one at a time, and either refused (discard a poker chip to the pot) or claimed (take card and all chips in the pot).  Points at the end are the face value of cards minus chips.  The catch - cards that form a run are only valued at the lowest card in the run.  Quick, fun and very catchy.  Great game.

Apparently I'm the last person on the planet to play this great game!

Superb, addictive little game. Simple to teach and learn, and guaranteed to be worth repeat play.

With a deck numbered 3-35, flip over a card and spend one of your precious 11 pass tokens to avoid taking the card. Eventually a player takes the card AND all the accumulated tokens. Repeat, but at game end you score only the lowest card in a sequential run... so even the 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35 only nets you 30 points instead of 195. Oh, and also deal 9 cards out of each hand, so you cannot be sure of whether a critical card will ever turn up or not! 

More addictive than Uno, more tense than poker. A huge hit. Highly recommended.

I don't see the purpose of randomly discarding cards. Maybe I'm missing something, but I think the added strategy of which runs you go after would make the game worthwhile. I would like to try it again this way, otherwise, there are probably other games I would prefer. --- I've got a homemade copy.

Yes, there's a lot of randomness at work here. But fortunately, that's offset by the fact you can try to "read your opponents" and guess their actions to some extent -- and doing so CAN help you do better in the game.

There's not a lot you can really say about games like No Thanks. It's a simple card game about taking the smallest numbers possible, but with some interesting mechanisms to keep it fresh: a sequence of numbers only counts as the lowest, and declining to take a card requires a cost of a chip, which is taken by the person who takes the card.

It's a strong filler, especially with a newer audience, but I find that my long-term gamers don't find it nearly as appealing.

No Thanks! is a quick, light, filler. While there's not a whole lot to it, it makes for a nice little game to play between games when folks are up running to the bathroom or refilling their drinks or what have you.

The strategy I enjoy the most is putting chips on cards that are clearly beneficial to yourself, but very bad for other players. It's a great way to build up chips on a card that you will eventually take (and the other players will let you because it's so bad for them).

For a filler game this checks all the boxes. Its quick, its simple to learn (I feel like I could bring this to my family and play it all night) and its a blast.

Edit: After 10 plays: Still a really good quick filler to have on hand. 2, maybe 3 plays per sitting is about all I can do before I start to look around for another game, but for those few games its fast, fun and exciting for a game with some cards and chips.

This game plays quickly with players only having 2 choices to make: take the drawn card or place a chip on it to pass.  Winner is determined by the player with the lowest total combo of points from the cards minus the number of chips they have.

Don't let its simplicity fool you, however.  The decisions in this game are weighted down by what other players have in front of them, how many pass chips each player has, and what you think your opponents might or might not do.  Easy to teach, and fun to play.  Good filler game.

I didn't like Bottle Imp. Well, it's not as bad as I thought.  With 55 wooden discs I am able to play No Thanks with my Bottle Imp deck.  Anyway, No Thanks! is a nice light game for up to 5 players that is extremely quick to both explain and play. I think this is one that belongs in every player's collection. I like to play 3 hands and add up point totals after each hand so at the end it's more about skill and less about who won due to luck/kingmaking.

This game is astonishingly succesful for it's relative simple basic premise - pay to avoid taking negative cards. As a filler this certainly is worth it's price, but the game doesn't look like it will hold longer interest, as the choices of each player are a bit too obvious. Can be explained in less than a minute, played in 10.

RATING: 6.5
No more than a warm-up, but a simple and clinical abstract game with one tough decision each round. I think the strategy devolves into risk mitigation, card-counting/probability and even memory (assuming the group play moves quick enough).  Easy to teach, fun as a warm-up, but all the poker chip transactions do become somewhat fiddly (44 in play during a 4 player game).  I recommend mandating quick player turns and possibly turning claimed cards face-down.  Play can get repetitive, so not one I would choose to play every weekend.

Rápido(entre 10-15 minutos por partida) y divertido; Y encima para todos los públicos, incluso los más novatos distrutarán de éste juego.
Es un juego de cartas en el que debes hacer la menor puntuación posible; la dinámica del juego es como sigue: se saca una carta del mazo y los jugadores por orden dicen si la van queriendo o no; si no la quieres pones una moneda y pasa al siguiente jugador (para pasar hay que pagar 1 monedita); llega un momento en que tienes pocas monedas y aunque la carta sea muy alta alguien la coge, y además te llevas las monedas que la gente puso para pasar; la carta tiene un valor numérico que es el que cuenta. Se siguen sacando cartas hasta que se vacÃ­a el mazo central. Las cartas que cada jugador ha robado las puede agrupar en escaleras de tal modo que si tienes dos o más cartas en escalera SÓLO te puntuará¡ la más baja. El jugador con menos puntos al final gana la partida, para hacer el conteo final: sumamos los valores de nuestras cartas "sueltas" y las más bajas de las escaleras y a eso le restamos el número de monedas.

"Geschenkt" is a filler game, published in English as "No Merci" or "No Thanks".  It just consists of number cards and tokens, and you can play with cards 3-35 from the 6 Nimmt deck (plus 55 poker chips), as described here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/34587  I have the "Geschenkt" German edition.  Easy to learn, quick to play, a decent and popular filler.

The Hidden Tiger Variant: Each player is dealt one of the 9 cards that are removed from the 33 at the beginning of the game. You can either hold this card until the end of the game, thus it doesn't count against you or for you, or you can play it during your turn, face down in front of you. Naturally you would only do this if you were using it to be part of or form a "run".

No Thanks! is a neat little card game which contains a good balance of strategy, chance and push-your-luck.

A numbered card is flipped; the player flipping said card has either the option of taking the card or placing a token on it.  Players continue to bid until one player has to, or chooses to take the card with all the tokens bidden on it.  Any two cards in a sequence (i.e. 25, 26) take only the lowest number into your end score.  Once the cards are all taken, players add up the numbers on their cards, subtract the number of tokens they have left, the lowest score wins.

One of my favourite elements of No Thanks!  Is that it is to a certain degree, self-balancing.  The more dangerous cards to hold tend to get bidden up; the player assuming the risk also gains the rewards of more tokens to deny future cards that also double as improving their end score.

Nice quick little card game for the end of the evening. 
Options on your turn are take the card or pass on the card. 
You score face value of the card and lowest score wins so there is some careful balancing between taking the card, or passing it up but spending one of your precious -1 tokens. 
Good fun, will happily play again .

For a game that takes 2 minutes to explain and 8 minutes to play, it's a pretty decent one! Often, it's wise to let a card you want go by for a round or two before taking to collect more passing chips.  A "sister" game to Take 6 / Category 5 (which I slightly prefer).  Grade: C+

Rating is based on a single 3 player game.  My initial impression at the moment is luke-warm.  There's not a ton of control and the decisions seem awfully simple to make since everything is open.  Dunno, maybe with more players the game evolves more.  Will try it again.

Featherlight filler. Bo-ring. Why play this when you can play something like Sticheln or High Society? It might be slightly better if played with open information, but it's still far too simple to be interesting, even if it only lasts a few minutes.

Muy buen juego de cartas con regusto a juego de naipes tradicional que tiene gestión del riesgo y push your luck y que juegado con un grupo que lo domine, con sus pistachos y su copita de Miura, puede ser una auténtica delicia. Muy rápido y adictivo, dos características imprescindibles para los juegos de cartas.

RATING: 6
A fun, quick bidding game. You try to make people take the cards you don't want and hope they don't buy the ones you need to reduce your score. You try for the lowest score in the game, but eventually you have to take some points. The games mechanics are nice; they force you to take points while encouraging you to avoid taking the points and the more people don't want a card the less it hurts to pick them up.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This makes for a great light, quick, gateway game. It's a mechanic that is pretty unique to seasoned gamers and really exotic to those new to the hoby, but it's really easy to grasp. 

A lot of new gamers will say at the end of a game they enjoyed, "Now that I know what I'm doing I want to play this a second time to actually try a strategy." Rather than wait for their second game, No Thanks gives players enough feedback for them to learn a few strategies and adjust how they're playing to actually try them in their first playthrough. Of course they'll have a better shot at winning in their second game since they won't be making the initial mistakes they made in their first, but to the extent that learning new things is part of what makes games fun No Thanks will get people hooked as fast as anything else out there. 

It's also good for people getting used to learning rules for games that are new to them. It's common for new players to feel victimized by rules they had not 100% comprehended at some point in the game. In a longer game they might get frustrated that the thing they thought was a legal strategy was based on a misunderstanding. This game gives enough feedback and is abstract and simple enough that new players kind of expect big swings in score and so don't mind losing on their first playthrough. It has the "you gambled and you lost" toughness of some classic games people may have played a decade or two ago, but since this game is built around a really neat mechanic that you can imagine incorporated in a number of euro games in the future, it makes a good segue into a more contemporary game.

Excellent filler that is loads of fun to play in a very short period of time. Compact enough to bring with you anywhere. My only gripe with the game is, I wish they would of tacked on some kind of theme for a little more appeal. Something like having different sizes of cake slices on the cards or something. It would of made for some more fun/jokes and laughter. Also the cards are kind of thin for my liking, but I can't really complain for the price of this game and all of the fun it offers. An extremely good buy. Don't say No Thanks and pass it up.

An excellent filler. It's fascinating how different groups have different ideas as to how many chips should be on a card early on before it's worth taking. Definitely should be played with chips hidden so you aren't usually quite sure as to when another player is running out... which makes the decision of when to take a card that hits a sequence for you much more interesting.

No thanks is an extremely bare bones game about gambling. You are basically trying to be the person to take the fewest number of cards, and during the game you are gambling about which cards will turn up in the deck, and whether the other players will let you get away with stealing their points. 

Each player starts off with a few dollars, and throughout the game, a number of cards will be distributed among the players. Every card you get has a number on it that counts as negative points in the end of the game.  When it's your turn to take a card, you can either bite the bullet and just take the negative points, or you can pay a dollar to a common pool in order to skip the card. 
Sooner or later, someone will have to take the card. That person also gets to take the pile of money that the rest of the players chipped into in order to skip the card. Now this player has a lot more control over which cards he has to take in the future.

If you get two or more cards that have consecutive numbers on them, you only count the lowest of them as negative points. The others are ignored.
This means that sometime you will be offered a card that does not give you any additional negative points. This is a perfect opportunity to milk the other players out of their money. You don't lose anything by taking the card, but the other players will most likely give you money in order to not have to take that card. If this card happens to be a big number card, you could just about steal all the other players money and thereby reduce their chances of skipping future negative points.

The only real choice on your turn is: Can I afford to skip this card, and who will benefit from my dollar? Or sometimes: Can I force the other players to pay one more round of dollars to me, or do they look sufficiently grumpy to just suck it up and take the card anyway just to spite me?
The rest is pretty much up to chance and some games will be won or lost on pure luck. I have found though, that the better players seem to win slightly more often, which in this game is enough for me. 

It definitely is one of the best warm-up games I have played. It takes almost no time to explain, it has enough luck so that anyone can play and not feel bad about losing, it is so quick that we usually play another game right after the first one, and everyone gets invested enough to get excited about the outcome.

I have no idea how to rate this properly. At a rating of 7, I both feel that I underrated and overrated it, so I guess 7 is about right for me. 
If the game was longer, or I would play it more often I think I wouldn't like it as much as I do, because there really is not enough to the game to be all that interesting. There is plenty of reason not to like it, and I would probably agree to many of them. But when we play it, all of that is forgotten for the few minutes it takes to play, and I simply have a blast.

This game is about as simple as you can get in the hobby game market, but is it beautifully simple or painfully simple?  I lean more toward the first description.  I am comfortable with a certain amount of luck in my games, but dislike games in which one's decisions are overwhelmed by luck.  Geschenkt probably falls in that latter category, yet I like it.  It's appropriately short, moves quickly, and the risk management aspects make for interesting decisions, even if they all pay off or fail based on the luck of the cards (specifically, whether certain cards have been removed from the deck at random).

Played 20+ Played with 3,4 and 5. I am enjoying playing this with my teenage kids. It has just the right dose of luck for a family card game ie high. We have been playing 3 games in a set, we have the scores recorded in a spread sheets with accompanying pretty graphs. If you like Lost Cities you are sure to enjoy this as the weight, time to play and angst are very similar. Jan 2010

*UPDATE* This has been going down well with my extended family with old and young enjoying it equally. We have been adding up a series of games until the loser hits 200 points which equals about 6 games totalling about 45 minutes play time. Aug 2011

Bought this in the same order as For Sale and the artwork had been the winning factor in getting the latter to the table more so far.  However, I think there's more strategy in No Thanks! and so makes it a better filler for gamers.  I need more plays to really judge the depth of this one, but I like the pace of them game and i think the rating will only drop after many many plays.

An unusual auction game where you are 'bidding' not to take the card on offer by paying 1 into the pot every time it is your turn to bid If you don't or can't pay, you take the card and the pot. You're also gambling on whether you can get runs or not, which can minimise your score.

Obviously, a lot of people enjoy it more than I do, and I don't know what they see in this game. It's extremely simple, dynamic and fast, which should be positive points, but to me its simplicity goes to the point of almost being silly. Being just a bunch of numeric cards and plastic chips, totally devoid of theme, certainly does not help.

I gotta disagree with the Vasel on this one, there is nothing special here.  Sure it is not a horrible way to pass the time, the game is almost completely devoid of any strategy.  It feels like you are playing rummikub, no thinking necessary.  Sure there can be some fun moments, but there are better games that fit this build, like For Sale!

Some can claim there is a push your luck element to this game but I really disagree.  You basically get to a point where you have to make a decision, and making one before that is never a good idea.

Small little push your luck card game condensed so much there's nothing you could take out and still call it a game. Cards are worth points equal to their value and the person with least points wins. Take a card or put a chip on it and pass. The jig is that every chip is worth -1 point and sequences of cards are worth only the lowest card in the sequence. Really easy to teach and quick to play. Great filler and gateway game! (2.6.17)

This one is difficult to describe, it is a game of card taking and passing, as each card taken is worth x points, and the person with the lowest total wins.  Only the lowest number in a sequence is counted, so 19,18, 17 is only worth 17 points.  Each player starts with 11 tokens, which can be used to pass ("no thanks"), with the person taking the card also taking the tokens which were placed on it to pass.

Very simple, quick, fun filler. Elements of push your luck where you take cards for points when points are bad, but if enough coins ( which negate points) are on a card it might make taking a high value card worth while. Also connecting runs makes points worth less. Very good.

Best filler i have!
And a very nice change to bid for not getting a card..

I've never met anyone who disliked this game.. and almost everyone immediately wanted to have a rematch.

You explain the game in 4 minutes & off you go! Most need one game to properly understand the concept & some can't help themselves and try to build streets no matter what.. but in any case the game is so simple, that there is always room for taunting & chit chat while playing (wich is awesome for a filler)

It has been on the market for over 20 years.. for a reason.

No-theme, just bidding on negative VPs.

3 to 5 players press-your-luck game. Ultra quick game play. Winning may depend on where you are seated. On a 3 player game I was stuck twice with bad cards (once REALLY bad.) I won the game when I got to start. Very random, but OK for the short play. Scoring is almost as long as the actual game!

Best with: 4

Good with: 3, 4, 5

This is a fun little filler, with a lot of capability for table-talk and cooperative play.  It's rules are so simple, that I have implemented it with 6-Nimit cards and chips. 

Down side: it is a simple game, and best as a filler.  There is a high luck factor, and the ability for players to pay too much early game and end up in a bind at the end game.

Finally, a card game that is novel and intelligent in design! Plays in 10 minutes or less! Requires some thinking! Excellent, super-light, super-quick filler.

Update (1/2/11) 17 plays: Having bought this, it has seen a LOT of plays recently. However, since it is so easy and light, people insist on playing several rounds of this, which is quickly becoming annoying by taking time away from other games. It is meant to be played once or twice, not once around, but that seems to be the trend. Sigh.

This is a great, quick game.  Having a few cards out of the deck adds just enough suspense and luck to the game without breaking it.  I like to vary my strategy, sometimes playing it safe, and sometimes looking for big risk, big reward.

RATING: 8
An evil little filler that plays in minutes but could easily swallow a whole evening if you're not careful.  And the best part is that you can kit-bash your own copy out of random crap you have lying around the house.  Highly recommended.

I'm not convinced there is enough skill in here to outweigh the randomness. It plays quickly and is dead simple to explain, both of which are great in a filler. You can play 2-3 games during a lunch break. It just doesn't fit my personal tastes. I prefer feeling like I have a little bit more control over things, even in a filler.

If I want this kind of ultra-simple filler I think that Incan Gold (for push your luck) is far more "fun".

Maybe the king of fillers. We played this on the same night as [thing=172]For Sale[/thing], [thing=220]High Society[/thing], and [thing=140863]The Council of Verona[/thing], and No Thanks! was the belle of the night.

I’ll be straight, I thought No Thanks! was going to flop. It sure enough sounded fun to me, but I thought from my group’s perspective it was going to be too simple, too filler, too kiddy-chan. Frankly I thought they were going to be too class for it.

Unh-unh. I badly misjudged my usually-down-for-anything-except-[thing=47082]Who’s-Got-the-Banana?[/thing] group on this one. Jane and Jesse sat down at the table, saw red chips, and turned into assholes approaching their usual [thing=104020]Vanuatu[/thing] level. People hoarded chips, took cards they didn’t need just to twist the knife, and tried to buy up all the cards in the game. The simple choice—take the penalty card or pay a chip—brought out depths of human behavior to which only games several pounds heavier usually aspire.

We played three other new games that evening, and No Thanks! was the best time we had that night.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

Most plays were in a single session at GenCon--it's just one of those games that tends to be played many times.  A very original design that nevertheless feels a lot like a traditional card game.

First played September 24th, 2007.  This is a quick learn (<5min) and a quick play (~25min) for 3 players.  There is some strategy in this, however it is more weighted on luck.  We had a lot of fun laughing at each other taking points.  The object is to take the least amount of points.  Everyone gets 11 chips.  On your turn, you turn over the top card and decide wheather or not to pass on it (play a chip) or take the card (and any chips with it).  If you take it, you get those points negative (any chips you get are positive and used as fodder for passing).  The cards range from 3 to 50 (why 3, I donno; perhaps so you will get at least negative 3 points?)  If you have connecting numbers, you will only lose points for the lowest one.  I.e. 27,28,29 only counts as minus 27; however missing the 28 will count minus 56.  Everyone starts a round and you count up the score.  "Highest" score wins!  If you know someone who has it, give it a try, otherwise, I wouldn't bother unless you are intrigued by the description and want to give it a shot.

One of the best signs people like a game is when you are finished they get ready to play it again with out formally deciding that the group will play it again.

I think that the game is a great filler game, however like any filler game, it does just that fills between the major games.

First of all, this game would be nothing without a solid and social gaming group.  The game is embarassingly simple and requires very little thought yet is able to drum up a boisterous crowd of hooligans.  Shouting "Take it!" is easily the highlight of the experience as players smile deviously considering their move.  It's good, clean fun but there is little of a game to get flustered about.

Inoffensive little card game. It's pretty ideal in terms of a game you can play while socializing. There are real decisions to make, but not too many that you need to be completely focused on the game. To me it's a similar niche to Cribbage or Red7. There's enough luck that you can't really try to play super strategically but there's also enough information that it's not mindless. I think I'd always enjoy a game or two of this.

Homemade version.

Really great game that is extremely simple and easy to teach. This game is also very addictive and quick to play which has often lead to a game night of only playing this (not a bad thing for our group).

Something I really like about the game is that it plays very differently with different numbers of players and different types of players, but similar enough that you always feel that you know the perfect strategy for *next game* (we're playing again, right?).

Invites a lot of trash talk between players ("Oh, you [b]really[/b] want that card huh?").

I had heard so many good things about this game that I was a little let down after I played it the first time. It's good but certainly not amazing. On the other hand, it's cheap, quick, and fun, and is one of the only games I can get my parents to play so I'm happy to hang onto it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and a lot of agonizing fun! Sometimes the decisions are easy but sometimes they are quite difficult depending on the number of chips on the cards and in your hand, the card number, and the cards in play. Part co-op and part screw you neighbor. All you need to make your own deck are cards numbered 3-35 and some bingo chips.

When looking for a quick, light card game that anyone can play, it's hard to go wrong with No Thanks! The game manages to create a number of interesting decisions out of the simple luck-pushing mechanic of deciding when to take and not take cards. It has a bit too much randomness and lack of depth to be in frequent rotation, but if I'm looking to kill fifteen or twenty minutes (especially with non-gamers), it fits the bill perfectly.

A really simple game with a surprising depth of strategy.  Or perhaps "tactics" is the more appropriate word.  The randomness of the draw means there's no set strategy you can employ.  You just have to go with the flow.  For a while, this was my favorite "intro" game for the never-be-a-Geek crowd.

At first I had zero fun with the game, but later plays showed me it can be fun. I still am not a fan of the game but I will play it sometimes. It is a ultra-fast filler game, great to introduce non gamers to the hobby. It has a lot of luck (luck of the draw) but you have some decisions to make. Overall a good filler.

It’s been years since I last played No Thanks! I have never liked he game very much and now I’m much harsher with my ratings. To me, No Thanks! is full with obvious decisions and boring gameplay. In general, I no longer enjoy most filler games, so I don’t think I will ever play No Thanks! again.

Good card games can be so simple: either take a card or pay a chip. Anyone can make that decision, right? However, there is a catch - in fact there are two. Nobody wants the cards, not even for free, because they give you points in a game where you need to have the fewest points to win. And the chips? They are scarce, very scarce.

Geschenkt is a quick and easy card game with enough of a 'press your luck & screw your neighbor' element to keep things interesting.  Setting aside 9 (unknown) cards from the play deck adds a certain amount of tension, as no attempt at sequencing is absolutely secure.

No Thanks! is a super simplified auction game.  However, instead of paying to take a card, you're paying to pass it on.  What takes the game a step up is how the chips on the card can build up.  Taking a high card like a 30 might not sound too good, but have it pass around the table a few times and build up 14 or 15 chips, you might just take it.  I also like that 9 cards are always removed from the deck so, you never have a complete idea of what will be or won't be coming up.  Awesome card game and a modern classic.

Chips can be placed so as not to take the current numbered card, or the card can be taken with the chips. With a run of cards only the lowest card counts against you. The strategy is basically in not overpaying and deciding instead to take the chips. Chips are subtracted from the card scores at the end of the game with the lowest total score winning. It is a fun, light, and quick game.

To me, No Thanks epitomizes what a game should be. Exciting, easy to explain, and short.

Fun and light, if somewhat predicatable. Once people get their first card or two, the choices get kind of obvious and nothing very surprising ever happens. It'd be more interesting if people would pass on cards that don't hurt them in an attempt to push them on other players. Good design but marred by shallow play.

A good little filler card game. Some decisions to be made regarding whether to take that bad card with all those "pass" chips on it (which give you points at the end of the game) or keep trying to pass. Probably better not to pass all the time even if you almost can do it.

Nice game for the size/price. Plays fairly well with 4-5 and is super easy to teach. However, the strategy depth is such that new players (who are the target of games like this) frustrate the experienced players by knocking things out of balance. Most gateway games don't really rely on a level playing field as much as this one.

Recommend Red 7 over this one... strongly recommend Red 7. But getting both together as a gift is a good idea.

RATING: 6
An interesting bare-bones game of increasingly asymmetric valuation. Likely to fall victim to the filler curse at games night - people will agree to play it once if at all given access to flashier, bulkier games - though it will no doubt develop finer nuances after repeated plays with the same group. Possibly also conducive to accusations of irrationality and kingmaking. Seems to benefit from hidden money.

Not a bad game. I like that you can go after other cards to lower your score. I don't like the random throw out making very difficult to calculate whats a good deal and what is not. It creates random winning - not skill. Not bad over all. Intial rating after 4 plays: 6.5

If I were a teenager again and going on a long bus trip with a couple of friends, this is what I'd pack.

Excellent ultra-light game. Anyone, including nongamers, can be playing it within 1 minute of pulling it out.  The strategy doesn't go that deep, but it has provoked some funny tabletalk.

Only played once.  I screwed up not one but TWO rules -- the "who goes next" rule and the "chips are one point each at the end" rule.

Nevertheless, I look forward to playing it again, so for now it gets a 7.

Later: Okay, I've played this a few more times and I still like it.  One of the best little fillers I've played.

Still later: There's just something comforting about sitting around a table with a deck of cards.

Először is inkább "Nem, köszönöm!", nem? Eléggé borzasztó fordítás.
A játék amúgy szórakoztató, van benne szerepe bőven a szerencsének, de egy kis taktikára, gazdálkodásra is van lehetőség. Szerintem túl sok az induláskor kapott korong, kevesebbel több esély van arra, hogy elfogyjanak, és rákényszerüljön valamelyik játékos a lap elvitelére.

RATING: 7
Defines "filler".  It's basically totally brainless, very easy to explain, and of course extremely portable. It's a good game for its category.

I played it 40 times with the rules wrong (I didn't catch that after taking a card, it's your turn again immediately).  I'm not sure I like it better the real way.

Honestly, it's kind of hard to get excited about this game; there's just not really that much there. It's just a simple little dumb little game.

One of the worst game recommendations I've ever received.  I think it works awful for anything less than 4 players and even then it's either brainless for those who get it or still confusing for those that don't.  I suppose the whole point is not to even think about it.  A game like For Sale is just FAR FAR superior and its still bidding, is still super simple to teach but actually has SOME strategy and SOME theme and so on.

REPLACED BY:  For Sale.

This game is just too simple. I'm big on probabilities and the probabilities with this are so simple, even when you take cards out, that even if your strategy doesn't win you the game you still feel it's too simple. The wife really likes it and I don't think anybody we've played it with dislikes it so it's at least got that going for it. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike playing it as I'm not likely to say no to it with more than 2 people, I just don't care for it. Just 2 people, however, and I definitely say no thanks to no thanks. (How many people have said that? Probably a lot.)

I'm not sure how I hadn't heard of this before, but this game is really clever and will be a great filler in between big games or maybe with the family.  I have never seen gameplay quite like this and it is really fun.  A very basic description:  You want the least amount of points from cards and if a card comes up that you don't want, you have to put a chip on it to pass it to the next player.  Since each chip allows you to subtract a point from your total as well as the ability to pass future cards, someone may take a high point value card just to reap the pile of chips on that card.  People will go out on a limb hoping they will draw the right card even when their chances are not good.  I've had a lot of fun playing this with my family.

What a lovely little cardgame. It's fast, unique and challenging. Played many times in Helcon III and I had to got my own copy. Was this the best published games in Essen 2004? RATING 7.
[After 50 games:]
If you play it with the same group again, again and again - then the excitement is lost and the decision making is too obvious. Even if you play with those variants available. Had to lower my rating 7 -> 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The rules are simple. Each turn, players have two options:
play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card
pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card

However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors. Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.

A neat filler game you can play with everyone. It has no theme which I don't like in general. But you can play 2-3 consecutive rounds without getting bored so that's cool. The negative counting is a little bit confusing at first but no deal breaker.

A simple card game with quite a bit of chance/random.  It's fun but almost unbearably light.  The big upside is that it plays very very fast (10 mins) and can be taught in 30 seconds flat.

I think the game was OK and funny to play, but its very simple and limited. It plays fast, but it's only 1 mechanic.

So it makes it a good filler and would not mind playing a few rounds if it hits the table. But I won't be buying the game.

No thanks

RATING: 8
As lightweight games go, this is in the "featherweight" class.  There are some challenging choices to make that is very worthy of playing in 15 mins.  

[A variant that I came up with is:  from the nine hidden cards taken out of the game during setup, pass one of these faced down to each player as secret information.  To spice it up a bit more, at game's end, each player reveals may optionally decide to use their secret card by adding it to his existing collection of cards acquired to affect their scores.]

Egy perc alatt megtanulható játék, a játékideje pedig 10 percbe belefér, ugyanakkor folyamatosan döntési helyzet elé állítja a játékosokat, méghozzá súllyal bíró nehéz döntések elé. Érzésem szerint egy kissé hosszabb játékidő, például több kártyalap jót tenne neki. Nem sokkal hosszabb, hanem csak mondjuk +10 lap.

Will always want to play and everyone who tries the game with me always enjoys it without hesitation.  Ten out of ten.

A game that is far greater than the sum of its parts.  Thorsten Gimmler has asked some simple and straight-forward design questions to produce a game of clarity which possesses immediate appeal.

The limited number of tokens and the removal of cards from the deck provide the game with its tension.  While the scoring system (lowest number in a chain of cards) gives Geschenkt a surprising level of strategy.  Highly recommended.

I used some poker chips and the cards from a 6 nimmt deck.

RATING: 8
A dirt-simple game that works really, really well. It feels like one of Knizia's better microgames, but it is actually the work of the equally minimalist (Odin's Ravens) Thorsten Gimmler.

In large part it works because it moves so quickly. Like Ra on speed, the decision is pretty simple, and often obvious, but once it gets interesting it gets really interesting. In particular, the ability to only count the highest card of a run can make a seemingly insane play the winning move. It's a shame that you have to randomly remove a few cards before you start the game, but I don't think it would work if there weren't a few potholes to fall into. As a ten minute filler, this amount of luck is easily forgivable, too.

While I'm sure it works fine with 3 (I've only played once, with five), it seems like it might be too easy to set up runs. A great, family-friendly filler for four or five, though.

This is a nice filler game. It's easy to teach, yet deceptively hard. I often come dead last even with the fewest cards, I just get stuck with really big ones for some reason.

No Thanks! was a game I purchased upon the constant appearance in lists of "filler" games. The game is easy to teach and very accessible even by non-gamers. There is enough decision making to keep gamers interested too.

I have played this many times with many different people. Lately though I have been playing more For Sale because it shares similarities to No Thanks! but adds an extra phase at the end that brings another level to the experience.

Pretty much the perfect five-minute filler.  I generally don't like push-you-luck mechanics, but making the entire game a single push-you-luck mechanic creates a situation that does appeal to me.  Teach in two minutes, set up in less than one, play in five, clean up in less one.  Recommended.

A fantastic light-but-skillful filler. My favorite bit is the push-your-luck aspect when the current card for bid is good for you but no one else and you try to swing it around the table that one more time. Will it make it back with more chips, or is someone else going to bite the bullet -- either to restock their supply, or just to take you down?

No Thanks is a great little card game that plays wonderfully well with 4 or 5. It's a nice lightweight game that has a lot of strategy packed into it. I still don't know exactly what the best strategy is; in our last game we got crushed by a player who we let buy all of the high cards over and over. All of the tokens he kept accumulating really countered all of his high point cards, and he ended up winning by a lot. Oh well. Great game.

Fun filler game where you have cards in a deck and you flip a card over with a number.  You can take the card or put a chip on it to pass.  The object of the game is to get the least points and each card gives you points ranging from 3 to 36.  If you have a "run" of cards you only score the lowest card in the run and chips subtract from your score.  Lowest score wins.  

A great filler.  I don't know anyone who does not enjoy this game.  It is over in 15 minutes and is a lot of fun.

This one is a mixed bag for me. Most of the people I hear talking about this do like it. For me most of the plays were pretty boring though. There isn't really any decision to make in this game, it mostly comes down to : Do I take 15 negative points so the next one doesn't get 10 positive points? For us this game needs someone to sacrifice himself for the team to make this interesting.

On the other hand I found this pretty funny and interesting while playing with a big family (all ages). I assume this came down to never knowing what the kids will do next.

So I may recommend this for families, but not for someone who isn't scared from something like Hanabi.

They'll all love these quick and simple games.  You try to get the lowest score by taking cards with the least points.  If you 2 or more in succession you only count the lowest card of the run.

3-5p, 20m. cards numbered 3-35. Somewhat similar to Loco & Cat5.  Before it came back in print, I'd only played a few 2-player hands on a home-made deck.  It was a very quick game, and for me had a very high "I want to play again" factor, since the luck of the draw made my wife win twice in a row. :D

October 2006 I bought the new Z-Man edition and played it at work during lunch.  For some reason it never caught on.  Downgraded rating appropriately.

Not bad, but feels a bit more like a math puzzle than a game. Maybe not a bad thing --- I do well at math puzzles and this game, and enjoy both --- but I found most groups of players I've tried this with have minimal interest, so it tends to fall a bit flat. I'm not sure about replayability either (too repetitive to be played many rounds in a row). Very elegant though.

Love this push your luck filler game. This game is so much fun when the others know you want that card, but keep pushing it around the table just to collect more money. This turns into quite a fun game that's really about screwing your neighbor. This game is small and can be brought out at a coffee house. Will never leave my collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is rather more entertaining than it sounds. The key skill is learning the point at which the accumulation of tokens makes an undesirably card worth picking up, and since everyone spots it at the same time, rounds can be agonizing as you wait to see if someone else will pick up a card you're planning to grab before you do, leaving you very short of tokens. A quality multi-player filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.77
No game in my collection fills this spot for what it does, and I have zero desire to find something else to replace it even if it could. If nothing else, this will likely be my second most played game ever due to its quick play, and I won't rule out it being number one. To me this is the definitive "shooting the breeze" type of game.

Rating Potential: 7.77 with little movement. I am trying to have 10 plays be a good spot to lock in a rating for a game, but this actually got a minor bump after that point after some plays.

Played 70-75 times. I rated this a 9 for many years, but after 66 games I award it a very rare 10. It´s just such a great filler in all its simplicity. Very simple game with ugly cards and chips. A fun game for what it is and a favourite filler in one of my groups. Remember all those times you picked 6 Nimmt! for that 20-minute slot and it took 40 minutes? Well, this game will really be over in 20 minutes.

RATING: 7
No Thanks! is a fun, and easy to play, little card game.  The game has a deck of cards each with a different number from 3 - 35.  From this deck 9 cards are removed at random.  This is important, because if you get straights of cards only the lowest one will score.  By removing some cards you never know if the next card you need in the straight will be in the deck.  Each player starts with 11 chips.  Chips are worth negative one point, and the winner is the player who ends up with the least points.  To play, the first person turns up the top card from the deck, which will have its aforementioned number on it.  That person has the option of taking the card, or putting a chip on it and passing to the next player.  Eventually, someone will take the card along with any chips on it, then turn up the next one, and the process starts again.

That's all there is to it.  This game can take 3-5 players, and plays in about 10-15 minutes.  It's a great filler, or lunch break game.

I really enjoy this game. Maybe because it's one of the very first Euros I played. Plays well with 3 to 5 (or, even 6) players, and is different every time we play. I replaced the "chips" with simple star-shaped beads from a hobby store. I think this makes the game appear less like a gambling game (it becomes more family-friendly). My version is Geschenkt! from Germany.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
another great filler that anyone can easily pick up - not necessarily play well, but pick up. It's essential that you keep the number of tokens that you have hidden or the game does not play at all well. If I have 20 minutes to kill, this one fits the bill very well - and it hurts my head less than David and Goliath. Has the advantage over 6Nimmt! with which it competes for table time, that it is finished in one "hand" whereas 6Nimmt! plays to a points total. Having said that, 6Nimmt! usually wins out.

For such a simple idea this game goes over quite well with most people.  It can be played with more than five = just reduce the number of chips everyone gets.  

In the end, however, the game really boils down to a crapshoot and people often make decisions which I don't understand... unfortunately these poor decisions often work out and that leaves me a little bit sour.

I created a version using a set of blank Bicycle playing cards. As well as cards with value 3-35 I also created a Blank, a value 1 and a value 2 card making a total of 36 cards. The cards are shuffled and 12 are discarded leaving 24 cards as in the base game. If the blank is turned over it is auctioned off to the highest bidder. The winning players' chips are removed from the game reducing the overall number of chips in the game. The Blank card is classed as a Joker and can represent any number and is useful to fill in a gap in a run.

How about that: a game that I've played more than a dozen times in just two sessions, have won very limited number of times and I still enjoy it! It's easy, it's fast, yet some people seem to be good at it and others seem to be less prone to win. This game has that 'one more time' vibe all over. It doesn't hit my top10 all time, but it's fun enough to sniff at it.

RATING: 7.5
Game in a Nutshell: Try and get as few card points as possible. Pay a chip out of your hand to pass, or pick up the showing card and all the chips that people payed to pass on it.

Played as: 3,4,5 player

Pros: Fast, a new way to play a 'card' game. People who don't like to think too hard enjoy it. Can be only interesting and still get plenty of play due to quick hands. Cheaper price makes it easy to get your money's worth.

Cons: Makes me wish the same people I play this with, would want to play something more involved. Can go stale if played repetitively.

Other: My rating may be low as I rated it more according to how much I feel like playing it rather than how well it works in its simple filler niche.

Best Use: Quick filler or played with 'simple' gamers.

RATING: 4
A simple card game about getting the least amount of negative points at the end of the game. You play chits on cards in order to not be the one to claim it, but as each chit is also worth a point, and you're bound to run out, you want to claim cards at the right moment to avoid having to take in more cards than you must.

It's quick and simple, but I tire of it really easily. I really don't understand how people can rate this one so high. There are just so many better, more engaging filler games than this one.

One of the finest fillers ever invented.  I believe this is a must-own for any board gamer.  The rules take a few moments to teach, non-gamers enjoy it, and there is enough for gamers to enjoy given the short play time.

A clever push your luck game, that's fun and easy to teach with only two rules: take a card or add a chip to the card.  Of course there's some scoring and strategy too (including extorting your fellow players).  Best played in rounds: either a set number of rounds (throw out lowest score?) or until somebody reaches a certain point total (-200?).

An impulse purchase that worked out well -- good lightweight filler in a very small form factor, with very simple rules. This is a very simple game to teach, very accessible even to kids (though some find it boring) and I have lost track of the number of copies I have given away. 

The soul of the game is the extortion.  I have the 32, and the 33 comes around to me.  Instead of taking it, I add a chip, and everyone else at the table adds a chip because they really don't want it.  I let it float around for 1, 2, or maybe even 3 rounds, accumulating chips for a nice squeeze play.  (No, I do not recommend letting a card go around 3 times -- someone will either decide to take it for the chips, or you will have miscalculated and someone will be out of chips and forced to take it.  But that's a choice.)

Highest tension per number of rules in a cardgame, game takes only 15 min play, but can fill a whole evening, because of the high "lets play again" factor.

Simple and easy game to both play and teach. Only played once so far but it's a nice fast playing filler. Nothing that remarkable in terms of game play yet appealing enough for it to see the table again so occasional replay should happen. Like some of the other good fillers out there... (For Sale, Coloretto etc) there is just enough to think about that the game still has some interesting decisions to make while not being overly analytical or heavy for a filler style game. I can see why it's regarded highly in the filler genre.

Impressive depth-complexity rate. A card is revealed and you choose whether to accept (and score negatively) or pay (and make it score less negative for the next player). With no money left, you must accept so it's important to manage your cash. In addition, if a card can be added to a series, only the lowest in the series will score negatively so cards have different value to different players - just like in a good and more complex euro.

Hidden Tiger Variant
By Larry Chong

During Setup, from the 9 cards that are to be set aside, deal one to each player face-down. You may look at this card.
Any time, on your turn, you may chose to play this card into your play area, then continue your turn. If you do not play this card, it will not count against you.

Amigo Variant

For 3-5 players. During Setup, give each player 10 pass tokens.
Remove the cards numbered 10, 20, and 30 from play (or 10, 19, and 28 for higher end runs). Shuffle the deck and remove six more random cards.

While I appreciate the "smallness" of the package I thought the artwork was very lackluster and that definitely impacted my experience. The gameplay was fine. Nice and light, and the decisions weren't too tough, But after all the hype I've heard about this game, I thought it was just okay. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A really good family card game. The rules are so simple that you can play this with almost anyone. But there's still a good amount of decisionmaking while you bid to try and collect as few cards as possible.

One thing I noticed is that the order of players makes a big difference, especially the player on your right. If you get someone who likes to grab early cards sitting next to you on the right it can really mess you up.

As a filler, this game serves its purpose spectacularly. Rules can be taught in under a minute and play is speedy with games running about 10 to 20 minutes. Game play is stunningly simple; either take a card, or put a chip on it. Even with only 2 simple actions to choose from, the decision can be surprisingly challenging due to the games ingenious scoring system. This game is addictive and it’s hard to settle for a single game in an evening. This game is a must have in any collection.

RATING: 7
Deck of cards numbered from 3 to 35, remove 9 cards. Each player starts with a number of chips. Flip a card, if you do not want to take the card, put a chip on it, and continue until someone  takes the card with all chips on it. Chips count positive points, cards count negative points. The trick is that if you have a sequence of cards, the only penalty is the lowest numbered card of the sequence. Play until deck runs out. Clever little filler. We also tried playing with 6 people, but it was too easy to run out of chips. I suppose it's neat, but as a filler I may get bored if I play it too often.

Top ranked filler game on the BGG polls alongside For Sale. Basic filler game, extremely simple with no theme. I enjoyed it a bit, but its not worth buying in my opinion - there's no theme, not much control over your cards, and it gets old pretty fast.

I think prettier pictures or a better pasted on theme could've helped. There are some good variants I heard like playing with chips/cards up/down and removing certain cards/ giving certain starting cards.

One thing I do find fascinating about this game is that a player who in theory took all the cards could have a run of say 15-30 which is only +15. Isn't that interesting?

Plays: 6 (P.S. implementing/ed this for a school programming assignment, but this shouldnt have affected my view)

EDIT: Someone mentioned how you could play a version of this with a For Sale set so I may try that. Its not worth buying in my opinion, but every now and then, its not bad.

Not quite sure why the rating for this is so high. Yes, it's clever especially considering how simple the game is, but after having played it once, I have no real desire to play again. Maybe if you added a gambling element, I'd find it more appealing (i.e. playing for real money).

I don't have many plays with this one, but it seems so far that players are too timid to really mess with other players.  It is clear to me that the optimal strategy is to create the worst scenario for your opponents, even when it means mildly harming your own score.  My family tends to play this game "nice", though, which leads to it being a rather bland experience.

No Thanks! is so simple in play that people may not engage with it and just throw chips in without any thought of strategy, which detracts from the overall enjoyment or longevity of the game.

A press-your-luck kind of game. The hand of cards is dealt out one at a time, and all cards are going to be taken (except for a few that are removed from play). You want to have the lowest score. You need to balance when to take high valued cards with when to try to go for card runs.

RATING: 7
One of the simplest rules ever but still interesting choices to make. Fast to play.

Update (29.6.2009): The game works quite nicely with 6 players if you give everyone 9 tokens at the beginning and use otherwise standard rules. You'd like to play something else (it isn't that good with 6) but if you don't have anything else in hand this works as a filler with 6 players too.

Started playing it in February of 2007 with my family, who took an instant liking to it (wife and 3 boys, ages 14, 13, and 7). To date (January 2017), it's still a winner with newbies, and although I sometimes feel a bit dragged into a game of it, I nevertheless enjoy playing it every time. 

It's a very clever filler-type game: Each player starts with 11 small red plastic chips. A deck of cards, numbered 3-35, is shuffled, and 24 cards are laid face down in one pile. The other 9 cards, face down, are set off to the side, out of play. 

The first player to the left of the dealer turns over the top card. He can pick it up or put a chip next to it. The next player has the same option; if he chooses to pick up the card he also picks up however many chips are in the middle next to the face-up card. 

Low score wins, and a player can choose the lowest among any number of a sequence of cards. (Keep in mind 9 cards are missing, so players have to guess at whether a sequence is going to happen for them.) 

Once players have exhausted their chips they must pick up the card in the draw deck. All cards must be played, and the game ends when the last of the 24 cards in the draw pile are taken. 

Scoring is done by adding the individual cards in one's pile (or the lowest among a sequence of cards) and then subtracting the number of chips one holds. Low score wins. 

Very clever, plays fast, lots of strategy that becomes apparent with repeated plays. And, my wife, who's lukewarm to non-standard games, says she likes it. A good warmup or concluding game. And, one of the best values of any game on the market. 

My 11-year-old son Trevor, who was 11 1/2 in the fall of 2010, rated it an 8.5. This one had long-lasting value for us as a family game.

This is one very interesting game, very humorus too...I think! At first you might say what's all the fuss. But, upon more game plays the great balance of the game becomes evident. For poker fans this game is quite nice; the bluffing is simple but outstanding! Do you take a card with 30 points on it because no one else will? Do you let the card ride to collect red chips? Do you take the card that is a sure point reducer for you or do you let it ride around the table to also collect chips! It's predictable and yet so unpredictable!

This has been very popular. My verdict is it's a good filler, certainly a clever design but the game can be spoiled if someone plays suicidally (and refuses to give out chips because someone is being "greedy"), but that's true of most games.

50+ plays. This works nicely as a 10 minute opener or filler between games. It doesn't get rated higher, despite the number of plays, because the winner of most games is largely determined by what cards turn out to be missing and therefore what holes don't get filled in people's sets. Which becomes more and more irritating with each play that your key hole card turns out to be missing (ie you have the 18 and 20 only to find at the end of the game that the 19 isn't in play - oh, what fun!). It's better if you love this gambling aspect I guess. It generates some occasional tension on whether you can afford to let it go round just one more time, but at game-end it's never really satisfying either, win or lose. It's more of a pastime that I nowadays play through clenched jaws after so many plays, but the fact it's got so many plays indicates a decent game for its niche.

I like this interesting push your luck game. Each round you decide whether to take a card or give up a token, cards add to your score and tokens reduce it. The lowest score wins, plays quick and being a semi numbers game it's right up my alley. Cheap price and I like the decisions to be made in it. It works for me so yes thanks.

I expected to hate this game, but I didn't. It was actually surprisingly pleasant. I don't know that I would really want to play it again, but it's FAR better than Slide 5, and I think I prefer it over King of Tokyo.

It's really simple to teach, and each turn you just have one yes/no decision to make, so it moves quickly. There are some mind games, but not too many. Obviously there is a lot of randomness, but you can take steps to control some of it.

It's great.

Everyone gets it in a minute and you are ready to play. Quick and fun. 

I got the mayfair edition and though the ribbon back side of the cards is awful, the climaxing colour of the front is perfectly executed and adds a lot to the game. Really pleasant to the eye and that is very important in minimalistic games like this one! It helps putting up with the mathy side of the game.

I am not sure yet if I prefer to keep my cards hidden from the other players!

Reverse poker: all the cards are there for everyone to see, but the number of chips left is hidden. This game has been a hit with all five players, since that makes it hard to keep track of who has how many chips left to keep escaping a penalty card.

Press your luck card game -- you place chips on numbered cards, trying to avoid taking the higher numbers -- however, if you have an adjacent higher valued card, it the higher number doesn't count your score. A good amount of strategy is involved in this.

Much like Love Letter, a surprisingly deep game in a tiny little package. It losses a little something when you're playing with someone who doesn't quite get the various strategies (grabbing a 34 with no promise of completing a run when there are 2 chips on it ... lame). But fast enough to play that those games don't ruin anything. Just means you gotta kick that person out of the next game ;)

This little card game is a great way to start or finish a game session. There is some card counting element to it.

A card which is taught in 30 seconds.  Lots of luck with this one, but lots of excitment and agony as well.  Tons of fun but not to be taken seriously.  I thought there was little strategy with this one, but my co-worker kicked our butts twice in row - so maybe there is!  For 5 euros, this one is a steal.

Incredibly simple game that's tons of fun. It has bluffing and outguessing elements, a large push-your luck aspect where it's important to note how greedy the other players are, and a bit of manipulating your opponents. It's also really fast: you can play five games in half an hour.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Another one of those games that is enjoyable to play but deflates due to the summing up and subtracting in determining the winner. A common phrase in regards to tactics is "milking" players of their plastic chips which I think leads to an appropriate theme for this abstract card game: players are diary farmers in the market for diary products with the various sell by dates (pictures of various states of milk decay needed), using golden wheels of gouda in the purchasing......I wonder if it would catch on.

A simple and quick filler with which to close a games night. It might give the impression that there is more to it than meets the eye, but there isn't. For the most part it is random and playing the odds (with a high dose of pure luck) and observing your opponents' cards is the best you can do. With 9 of the cards randomly out of the game, the remaining cards produce a highly random game. There isn't even a meaningful element of 'press-your-luck' here.
All told however, as a quick filler it does the job.

When I looked at this game and it's themeless face I knew I would hate it. Turned out I was wrong. In this game, each player gets some red chips. The goal of the game is to end the game with the fewest points. One player flips a card from the deck. They can chose to take it, and flip another card and make the same decision, or pass by adding a red chip to the card. The next player in order then has the chance to make the same decision. At the end of the game, the red chips subtract from your score, and your cards in number sequence only count the lowest number. There's a ton of fun tension in this game as to deciding when it's worth grabbing a card to bite the bullet.

A person could really get into this game--counting chips and knowing who has to purchase and how many times a card that won't hurt you should go around the table before you take the chips.

I overlooked this game for a long time because it just sounded too simple to be that fun...  Well, it is definitely simple (either take a card from the middle of the table, or pay a chip to pass).  But it is really a lot of fun trying to put all the cards you take in a sequence to lower your points and make sure others can't do the same.  I didn't expect a game this light to have both strategy and screwage.  A delight to play and a favorite game - and you can't beat the price.

Frustratingly fun card game.
Bid with limited chips not to take the offered number card. Any cards taken are minus points (but you get the chips that were bid on it).
Try to minimise the minus score (everyone will be on minuses, trust me!) by getting cards of consecutive numbers as then only the lowest in the run counts towards your minus score.
Be careful though as not all the cards are used in the game, so the one you may be waiting for may not be in this round!

A short filler where you win if you have the lowest valued cards in front of you at the end of the game. Every turn the decision is quite simple: add a chip next to the card or take it! But the number of chips are limited and sometimes you don't know if the card will go over one more time... Push your luck and doubleguess your opponents - that's all but it's funny! But 6 Nimmt is better!

6-player game still seems to work quite well. I assume it to be best with 4-6-players, I'll have to try it with seven players. One of the best simple&fast fillers in my book that supports many players, and yet requires some skill to win the game.

Very simple game, a card is turned over and in turn each player must choose to take or not take the card. If they don't take the card they spend a token worth 1 victory point. This continues until someone takes the card and all the associated tokens.
At the end players score points equal to all their cards (only the lowest card in a straight counts) minus the number of tokens.
This is exactly the sort of game I am not very good at, in which you are playing the other players rather than the mechanics (more psychology than calculation) but it plays fast, is good fun, and is strongly influence by the strength of the players.

About as simple a card game as could be imagined (you could easily play this with a deck of ordinary cards, and some coins, matches or whatever else you have to hand to use as counters) - but this is a very entertaining game with real decisions. (They seem to be particularly agonising in the 3-player game, where you are really forced to use those chips carefully.) While this isn't quite a regular end-of-night game in my groups, it is played quite frequently, and is always enjoyed (at least I know I always enjoy it :)). And every time I have played this recently I have come more to appreciate the depths of the game (and upped my rating accordingly from 7 to 8). There are some very hard and agonising decisions here, when you realise that it is frequently right to take even a fairly high card when you still have plenty of chips in hand...

Incentivization: the game. I like it a lot! It plays quick enough, and has enough interesting, tactical decisions to be made that keep you engaged in a play. There is indirect player interaction present in blocking others from completing their sets. The challenge it presents to you is the timing of when you choose to hamper others over helping yourself. It is simple, yet inexplicably addictive.

Simple concept for sure.  Decisions during game play, no doubt.  But in the end just didn't feel satisfied with results for the time spent "thinking" about the decisions.  In the end, most decisions pretty straight forward.  I suspect that multiple rounds might make the game more appealing as it would bring players scores closer to the overall mean.  For playing tricky card (trick) taking games, I prefer Flaschenteufel.

Might play this again as a gateway game if someone asked, but I am unlikely to point it out or to request it.

RATING: 7.5
Add a chip to the pot to pass your turn to the next player or take the card shown along with the pot. That's your decision each turn until the deck is empty. You start with 11 chips, clutched secretly in your palm; and the deck, having numbered cards from 3 to 35, is shuffled and 9 cards are removed at random. (Why? Tell you in moment.) The player who takes the card/pot turns over the next card and takes another turn. If you run out of chips, you're stuck - you have to take the card and pot. Cards you receive are placed face up, in numerical order, and your chips remain secret. When the deck is empty, you add up the point value of your acquired cards, and subtract the quantity of chips you still hold. The player with the LOWEST score wins. So you want to avoid taking cards, but to do that you need chips, and you can't get more chips without taking more cards.

Ok, that seems boring, but I left out the crux, which is this: every card you have that is 1 higher than another card you have, has a point value of zero. In other words, when you have cards in direct sequence, only the lowest card of that sequence counts against your score. Here's an example: 3, 9, 10, 11, 13. The 10 an 11 are part of a sequence that the 9 starts, so they count as 0 points. The remaining cards (3, 9, 13) are your score (25), minus whatever chips you have left. This is why 9 cards are removed from the deck at the start -- you can not be sure if the gap between any two cards can be connected, because the connecting cards might be one of the 9 removed. 

It's a very simple game to learn and play. There's bidding, gambling, and speculation. There's pushing your luck. And there's usually one guy at the table who plays so unpredictably nobody wants to sit to their left. But never mind that, it's a quick game, and a great gateway or filler.

Having played this a couple times now.  I've decided that it gets a little boring for me after about 2-3 hands in a row.  Which, conveniently is just about the length of a full game.  Even though it's a pretty short game, it's not something I would go for an immediate replay of, unlike most filler games.  Once thru, and then move on to another game, please, or I'll go play with the folks over at that other table.  :)

Very quick, simple and easy-to-learn push-your-luck filler. Fills a niche, but it has bombed so far. Gamers sometimes find the removed cards too random, and non-gamers don't seem to find this engaging. Needs the right crowd. Impressed me for my first play, but it has started to slide, and I'm not sure if it's the players or the game. I think this will fare better if I pull it out, say, before a meeting, instead of at a game night.

A surprisingly quick, pleasant, and rather interesting little game.  I knew when I picked it up that it would be fun to play.  Some of my friends really like it and want to play all of the time.  As for me, I still have not quite figured it out.  Some games I do well, some games not so much.  I really would like to be able to approach this game in a more consistent manner.  So, while I do enjoy it, it almost seems to be too random for its own good.  Perhaps playing with people who play in a manner that seems to be excessively random is my problem. [11/18/2008]

A quick filler that's easy to teach and one that my daughter loves because no matter the value of the card if there are a lot of chips on it she's taking it. Trying to be strategic and link up cards for runs is fun because you don't know if the one card you need has been burned or not. We enjoy this game with friends or at dinner waiting on food too.

No Thanks -- Played four- and five-player.  Great filler.  I'd like to try varying how many cards are removed from play.  Random removal of cards is necessary to bring positive tension to the game.  I'd just like to see which number achieves the best balance of tension and strategy.

RATING: 7
Took a bit of time for this little gem to shine through. Repeated plays with kids showed my what this is: 
part risk taking and speculation. Quite neat, given the simplicity of it. Conclusion: always play a couple of games in a row (at least 3)

Edit: This now sees more and more play. Warning: moves that work with one group do not work with another as this is a very groupthink dependant game. (Which is actually a good thing) Also players who are good at reading people will probably do well, or at least they'll have something to do.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A short card game with almost no rules, No Thanks is an easy sell to a group with a few minutes (under 10) to spare.
The game qualifies as a "push-your-luck" since players try to avoid getting high-valued cards by adding money to the unwanted card as an enticement for others to pick it up. There is some debate as to how much skill is involved, especially since you cannot always predict who is going to win as you play. Still, everybody involved feels as if there are plenty of life or death decisions to make and that creates a fun atmosphere

One of the simplest fillers to teach. It's one of those games where the 'catch' of the game (allowing cards which are beneficial to you, but not to anyone else, to go round the table in order to collect coins) isn't felt during the rules explanation, but makes itself apparent during the game. Those who fail to grasp this concept though, will probably end up hating this game.

Yes Please!

As a light filler I can understand the popularity of this game. However, this is a one round game and that single round can end extremely quickly - often too fast for me to get involved enough to care if I win or not. However, you have more control than other card games with blind draws, so this may be exactly what you're looking for when it comes to simple card games. Of course, one must consider that if they own this game and suggest it they will have to endure the same chorus of "NO THANKS!" from their hilarious friends for the rest of their lives.

[26 plays] I rate this an 8 because it is so simple it can be taught in 1 minute and enjoyed by almost anyone. It is surprisingly tense at moments, incorporates some strategy, a good dose of luck, some memory tracking skills, and a fun element of psychology and bluffing. This was an immediate hit with family and I can't imagine a group that wouldn't enjoy it.

Silly little fast playing filler that works well. Players have a handful of chips. Each turn, a card from a deck ranging from 3-35, is turned over. Going round, players either place a chip on the card to avoid taking it, or take the card (and any chips on it). Cards with consecutive numbers are placed together.

The catch? When the deck runs out, players score a negative score equal to all loose cards and the lowest card/s of each running set. Any chip is worth +1.

27 Feb 2006. Very very good light filler! It's so simple, yet so fun! "Why didn't i think of that?" really comes to mind when we played it. Also it's quick, "let's play another round" sentiments is not uncommon. it's also a great gate-way game. My wife, Shih-Huei, managed to get a POSITVE score (+3) at one of our game. She was really lucky to get only one set of cards from 28 to 33 in a sequence. and since no one wanted any of the big cards, she was really milking in the cash. she had 31 chips left over and her negative score was only 28. Amazing!

A szabályismertetés és a játék rövidsége miatt igazi jó átvezető játék. 
Egyes lapokra sorban plusz pontot érő korongokat helyezve dönthetünk arról, hogy a lapot, amely a rajta levő szám mínusz egyszeresét éri nem akarjuk elvinni. Aki elviszi végül a lapot, a korongokat is viszi, plusz ha sorba tudja helyezni az általa elvitt lapokat, akkor csak a legkisebb pontértékű mínusz pont számolódik el. Folyamatos döntési helyzetbe vannak tehát a játékosok. Könnyű, bárkivel játszható, kellemes partyjáték.

At first I thought the game was totaly random, just a vapid little filler.  We played it as a closer just to try it out.  We decided to just play another hand, then another, then another.  Man this game is absurdly addicting.  It is so simple.  Sure the luck of the cards can just be against you, but for the most part all of you choices are tough, and most of the time if you do poorly it is because you made some mistakes.

Regardless, even if the system turned out to be totally random, it is a blast, and frankly that's all that really matters.  A fab filler.

This is absolutely one of my favorite fillers.

UPDATE: For some reason we though it would work with 6 with 11 extra chits.  Technically it does, but it loses much of its control; far clear from my liking.

Everything a filler game should be: three seconds to explain, ten minutes to play, cheap to buy; fun, tense, lots of opportunity for trash talk and meta-game cajolery.  I'm not convinced it's anything but a total luck-fest, but still a must-have for any gaming shelf.

RATING: 8
A pretty fun filler. It's a bit deceptive in that you think there is a bunch of luck involved and if you can manage to get a bunch of cards in a row you can win, but it's a bit more subtle than that. You've got a closed economy for passing that can really increase your control over what cards to take at the expense of getting unwanted points, and so in that way, there's a press-your-luck balance in deciding whether or not to pick something up or let the cards go around. I like playing with the variant where you have a hidden card that you know what it is, as it gives you a bit more control.

Quite dry in itself, since it all revolves around the numbers three to thirty five, but it's the above table shenanigans that make this enjoyable. Nobody else wants the current card; you're happy to take it, but do you risk sending it round one more time to rake in the chips? Or perhaps the card going round would be perfect for someone else, but slightly bad for you. Do you take it, to nobble them? Or leave it, hoping someone else makes the sacrifice?

This game plays like an opposite For Sale.  In this game players take turns bidding chips to NOT take a card with a number printed on it form 3 to 35.  This is because when the deck runs out the player with the fewest points wins.  The nifty thing is when someone does accept the card they also receive all the chips that were bid on that card so they have more bidding power in future rounds.

There are also a couple other small nuances.  Chips themselves are worth -1 point each at the end of the game.  A consecutive run of cards only counts the lowest number.  And 9 cards are taken out of the game each round so you may be sitting on that 19 and 21 and never even have an opportunity to snatch up the 20.

Best of all it's small and plays in less than 15 minutes.  Great filler that's easy on shelf space.  Like For Sale, though, it plays better with more players.

Part of my 2014-08 little card game crave. I was on the hunt for good card games that would fit into little plastic containers. Easy to carry around and easy to bring to the table. Among these are No Thanks, Love letter, Tichu etc.

Played this with my parents.....it was a blast...a very good game.

Very light game of chicken. I think there's less control involved than you'd think at first sight, but who cares? It has some agonizing choices and an individual hand only takes 5-10 minutes to play. What's not to like? Very suitable as a filler, but don't play for too long.

A wonderful little filler card game that has a decent strategic element.  The rules are a snap to learn in 30 seconds and a round plays pretty quick.  I always finish this game wanting to play just one more round.  Features some degree of a press your luck element with passing to get more chips.  Very non-gamer friendly.  Overall a lot of fun in a little package.

Played for the first time with three people. This is a simple push your luck game that, with the right people, is a good time filler. Each play took 15 minutes or less. There is more luck involved than I would like as given by the fact that in our 3plyr group one person went from over over 100pts one round to sub 50 another and somewhere in between on the 3rd. It feels like the game would be more fun with 4 or 5.

RATING: 6.5
[Amigo 'Geschenkt' 2004 edition] {Filler; risk-taking, set-collection} {basic 6.5, tactical 6.5} Geschenkt is a solid filler. It is fast and short enough that players won't feel bored with consecutive plays. Players only make 1 decision each turn - to take or not to take a card but this decision is agonizing enough. Players have to take risks in starting new sequence. It's not possible to calculate the risk accurately due to the incomplete information of the deck. Players have to evaluate the risks based on partial information and statistical calculation.

I got the opportunity to play it several times with my partner and in-laws over the holiday break, and we all seemed to enjoy it. There seemed to be several viable strategies to the game (I tried to take few cards and really push for chips when I could, while my mother-in-law took lots of cards and managed to chain them together in order to minimizes her losses and reap in tons of chips), and it was so simple to teach and play that non-gamers could easily be introduced to it. A good filler game that I can see coming out a lot.

Quick game that has some strategy. I much prefer the 3-player version with less chip count to spice things up and make it more "how far do I want to push my luck." With more people it can get wonky with people playing kingmaker (even accidentally).

You also really need to play 3 or 4 games of it back to back and combine the scores as the game can get pretty swingy at times.

I build a PnP copy because there's not much to it other than cards 3-35 and 11 tokens per player.  However, there's more to this game than first meets the eye.  It takes a few games to appreciate it.  After a few games, you begin to see the strategies for developing sequences and taking cards that have built up tokens.  It's better though if you keep the player tokens secret as a variant.

Played this once with a group for a church activity.  One of them didn't understand the strategy whatsoever, and ended up taking pretty much every card that came to him and predictably ended up losing.  Of course, this kind jacked up the game for everyone else.  So I'm going to hold of on rating this until I play it with a more competitive group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played 10+ times.  Great push your luck little filler.  Very tense.  The decisions seem so simple yet filled with angst.  The game depends a lot on the cards that are missing; ie whether it will be a high scoring game or a low one and you sort of have to guess which one (or be lucky) to do well.  I look forward to my next playing. **update** rating up because it's fast and I enjoy playing it. Lots of unknowns but it's over quick and you can try again. 2009/05/14

RATING: 7
This game, players try to score as few points as possible.  Cards in the deck are numbered 3 to 35.  Players also have a number of pass tokens.  

The game starts with a card revealed.  The first player may place a pass token on the card to not take the card or take the card.  If the player places a pass token and passes, the next player may choose to take the card or place on of his pass tokens to not take the card.  If the player choose to take the card, he will gain all pass tokens on the card.  Then the next card is flipped up and the play continues to the next player.

Once all cards have been taken and there are no more cards, the round ends and the round is scored.  Players group the cards they have in runs of consecutive cards.  Player score points for all cards not in a run.  Player score only the lowest card of each run of cards.  The player's score is reduced by 1 for each pass token he has.  After scoring, another round begins.  The game ends after 4 rounds.

Can learn in a minute. Take a card and any coins on it, or spend a coin to pass it on. When you take a card you get the value on it as points. You don't want points.

Great filler with little to no downtime. Constant decisions on whether to push your luck, whether it be to try and draw more coins out of others before taking a card, or to risk going for a sequence of cards as only the lowest card in a sequence of 3 or more counts for points.

I don't normally care much for fillers, but I was pleasantly surprised by No Thanks. You can teach the rules in 30 seconds and play a game in 10 minutes. The decisions in the game are so simple, but they can also be difficult. I found myself always taking the 34 card early on and inevitably the 35 card would come out. Then the fun starts of seeing how much you can milk it before someone else caves and takes the card. By our 3rd or 4th game there was definitely more "price enforcing" where someone would take a card that they probably shouldn't just to prevent other people from milking the pot. I definitely enjoyed it, and it's probably my favorite true filler (less than 15 minutes). I have it on my CSI wish list for when I need to get the free shipping.

It plays so quickly and is very easy for a newbie to come up to speed. A lot of people say that there is a lot of luck involved, but I win about 3/4 of the time, so I am not so sure.

As filler, No Thanks! is about as light as I'm willing to go with gamer friends.  It is a borderline kids' game, but it sets up and plays in under 15 minutes.   The game ends before any real tension could be generated; this would have been better with twice as many cards.

A great little filler.  The rules and gameplay are so short and clean, that it is accessible to anybody.  Lends itself to multiple playings in one sitting.  Can be a very noisy game (which is one of my favorite aspects of any game).  Highly recommended, especially for the price.

UPDATE:  You know what?  I am awfully tempted to push this game up to a 9.  There is no reason for me to ever turn down a game of it, it takes so little time to play, and is nothing more than PURE INTERACTION.  OK, there might be a bit of tactical thought in there, but I love the interaction--and I defy you to play just one game of it.

After the first few games my thoughts are "there's got to be more to it than this". I'm still waiting for the a-ha moment. Initial rating of 5.

10 plays: I'm getting slightly more enjoyment out of the game. Rating increased to 6.

20 plays: Was about to downgrade to a 3 or a 4, but realised that because we hadn't played for a long time we were playing a critical rule wrong. I knew something was up because the game felt broken, but we corrected our mistake for the next game and my confidence was restored. Stays at 6.

Probably the easiest game to get to the table. Explain it in 1 minute and play it in 15.

At first the game seems sorta stupid. But after one play you can see the light switch flick. After two you see another light switch as they see a bit deeper strategy.

First rate filler and excellent travel game, though I wish it scaled to 6 players.  



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 5
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 5

RATING: 7
Great simple game.  You don't want points, you have 11 red 'no thanks' chips worth -1 point each.  Every turn you turn over a card and take it or put a chip on it and the next player then chooses to take it or put a chip on it and pass.
If you take the card, you get all the chips.  If you have 2+ cards in a row, you only count the points of the lower number (example: if you have a 21, 22, and 23 card, you only have 21 points.)  If you have no chips, you MUST take the card...and then next, and the next, ALL THE CARDS.

Do you take that card or use up one of your few red chips?  What if that 19 point card comes up that you don't want, but already has 4 red chips on it?  You have an 18 and 20, so why wouldn't you take the 19 card?  Maybe you put a chip to force another play to take a high card or hope for it to come around and take the card with more chips.

Six plays in, and I'm still not sure about this.  It seems okay - maybe it shines most when you play it repeatedly with the same crowd.  Drawbacks: it's really bland since it's purely mathematical, and the luck of the draw can determine the winner.  The last game had such crazy draws that it put me off the game even more.  Haven't played it in months - will it ever hit the table again?

UPDATE: Gave up and traded it.  Got another copy in trade, but it went straight to the trade pile.

I think there are better fillers out there. Luck plays a BIG role in who wins and who doesn't. Fortunately, it plays in under 10 minutes, so the amount of luck is tolerable. I prefer to play with the variant of passing out the discards face down to each player, so they have some additional information. Excellent family game, in that it is enjoyed almost equally by children and adults.

Great filler.  Interesting decisions.   One play, very very promising.  I expect this to be a staple "go to" filler.  Interactive, skillful, random, fun and short.  Goodness in a card box.  Great great game jampacked into 20 minutes.  Three plays so far, it has that special great game feeling.  If the game is still shining in a few more plays, this will be an easy 10.  May indeed be the perfect filler for me.  Time and more plays will tell.  It may not be the perfect filler, but as far as fillers go I don't see any flaws.   Quick, strategical, laughter, and a sprinkle of luck.  Great times indeed.  If there is 20 minutes for a game, this is the one I want to play.

I'm generally not a huge fan of "filler" games, but this one wasn't bad.  It's yet another quick and simple card game that is fine as long as everyone takes it for what it is and doesn't spend too long making up their mind on their turn.  If you play with someone slow then this game could be miserable, but if everyone keeps it moving and understands that luck will play a large role then it can be a nice filler.

About [thing=12942][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=12942][/thing] is a card game mixing resource management (chips) and set collection. Is has straightforward rules and can be taught and learned in around 2-3 minutes, and the playing time is near 20 minutes.

It is an efficient filler, allowing for quick, but important decisions, and has a small downtime, even when playing with 5. It is smart in offering a short amount of rules alongisde a solid and entertaining gameplay.

Replay value is high by the nature of the random order and cards in the deck, as well as with the use of chips and accepting cards. Production value is OK: just 33 cards, 55 plastic chips and rules in a sheat of paper inside a small box - everything do their part, but nothing calls for attention, be good or bad.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
After shuffling all the cards (which go from 3 to 35), nine are taken out, without being revealed, in order to create some uncertainty about what cards are in play. Each player starts with 11 chips, and these are kept hidden during play. In each turn the player has 2 options:
- Accept a card;
- Deny it, then paying a chip.

If the player accepts, she adds it to her tableau, and also takes all the chips (if any) given by other players that refused the card. If she refuses the card, she pays one chip in order to do it. A player without chips can't refuse a card. Play goes like this, with a new card being revealed after the last was taken - the person that took it is the first to decide if the take the card or not -, until the draw deck is depleated, at which point the game will be over and scoring will happen.

In scoring, each card counts its face value in points, and points are bad here. The twist is that set of cards only count the one with the smallest value: for instance, say that the player finished with the following cards: 7, 11, 12, 13, 22, 32, 33, 34 and 35. Her score will be counted lie this: 7 + 11 (11, 12 and 13 are a set) + 22 + 32 (32, 33, 34 and 35 are another set) = 72 points. Then each chip the player has count as -1 point.

The person with the fewest points will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Only one: either to keep or not a card. Is is simple, but very efficient in creating branching aspects. Deciding to accept or refuse take into consideration your current cards and the ones the other persons have, your amount of chips, the possible connections to form sets later (and, regarding this, the number of cards still to be revealed), the face number of the card in question and, finally, the number of chips already paid to refuse the card.

Therefore, the decision is clear and, many times, easy to be made, but it does require occasional ponderation, and it carries weight.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Portable and, unlike many games in tiny boxes, you can still use the original box if the cards are sleeved;
- Language independent;
- Good amount of interaction, but with little agression;
- Fine ratio between decisions amd playint time.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Works best for 4 or 5 players;
- Random factors (which cards are in play and which aren't; the order in which the cards come) can have a strong impact in the game - but the resolution of the game is so fast that this shouldn't bother much.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Thinking that [thing=12942][/thing] while it is a proper name for the game, it truly isn't the most correct one, as I haven't seen such politeness. There are plenty of other options that would be more truthful to what actually happen during play: "No, no, no, no!" seems lacking in variation, while exsuding negativity, but is actually acurated. "F**k Me", is a pretty normal occurence, but it could induce tp some sore mistakes while marketing it. "Come on 23, 23, 23... damn, is a 29. I'm screwed", bear some ring to it, but sure would cover a lot of the box to write. 

In spite of the really small set of rules, [thing=12942][/thing] is a pretty clever game: it allows for constant decisions, some tough moments thinking about what might be best for now and for later, indirect, yet relevant interaction and the twist in the scoring made by the set collection brings new considerations without overhead.

Overall, [thing=12942][/thing] is a big winner in the filler territory, managing to be in league with [thing=172][/thing], [thing=37759][/thing], and [thing=5782][/thing], as one of the better ones in the niche. Easily recommended.

Quick and fun 20 min filler for everyone. Dead simple. I love drawing a 30+ card that would very suitably fill a slot in a series of high cards...just to decline and pass it round in order to collect a few extra chips! Greed is good as Gordon Gekko said. And so is this game.

This is a lot more fun with 3+ players. Loses a ton of charm at the 2 player count. You really need to play multiple games with the same group as to watch people change strategies.

King of Siam is still my favourite filler, but this is a close second.

I have only played it once (5 player), but it seems like a nice filler game.  It plays very quickly, and keeps the interest up.

I have played numerous time now.  You never really feel like you have any real control in this game, but it is fun to be the only one who can take a card and let it go around a few times just to get chips.  I sure got some nasty looks when I let the chips pile up on 34 when I had the 35.

One of the best 10 minutes of gaming there is! Neat filler where players avoid taking cards, especially those of high value, in order to score the lowest total points. The kicker is that you must pick-up a card unless you pay one of your precious chips. But when a player decides to take a card, he gets all chips on it as well. In addition to providing opportunities to say "No Thanks!", chips are worth -1 point each at the end of the game. Cards are worth points equal to their face value - however cards in sequence only tally the lowest towards the score. Simple yet clever card game that continuously forces tough decisions.

I love cut throat games and this one is great.  You start with a fixed number of chips. A card is turned over number 1-36?  Your choice is, put a chip on the card and pass it or take the chips on the card and the card.  Cards count their value against you chips count for you.  The interesting bits are that consecutive cards only count the lowest value against you and you randomly pull 9 cards out of the deck so you don't know all the cards that will be available.

Rated after 10 games. Very fast game, you usually have time to play this and even explain the rules. The scoring mechanics are quite nice, but you sometimes need to make "stupid" moves, because otherwise you'd end up with even worse result. Probably gets quite boring sooner or later.

Updated after 15 plays, didn't feel boring at all (over four years since the previous paragraph). Good game for tiny time slots.

Played three one round plays last week, it was fun. Good filler. One more round yesterday, good filler.

One four round play recently, I just need to shuffle the cards better in the future - very important in this game.

This is an excellent start-of- or end-of-night game.

No Thanks! is a card game designed to be as simple as it is engaging.
\13\\13\
The rules are simple. Each turn, players have two options:
\13\
    * play one of their chips to avoid picking up the current face-up card
\13\
    * pick up the face-up card (along with any chips that have already been played on that card) and turn over the next card
\13\\13\
However, the choices aren't so easy as players compete to have the lowest score at the end of the game. The deck of cards is numbered from 3 to 35, with each card counting for a number of points equal to its face value. Runs of two or more cards only count as the lowest value in the run - but nine cards are removed from the deck before starting, so be careful looking for connectors. Each chip is worth -1 point, but they can be even more valuable by allowing you to avoid drawing that unwanted card.

RATING: 5
A game where you're trying to hold on to your chips and not gain cards. You give up a chip to "pass" or take the card. However, cards accumulate chips, so at some point they may not be so bad. Additionally, having lots of cards helps since cards next to each other can't hurt you. However, you take out 9 cards from the deck, so you don't know whether the card you need is in the deck. Fun, but seems a bit light and random.

RATING: 7
A bit of a learning curve as beginning players are initially way too nice -- but they learn how to be nasty fairly quickly. Geschenkt lasts only one round, yet I'd lean towards three rounds per game since play time is short, the cruelty of the removed cards will be spread among everyone, and group think will twist everyone's plans from one round to the next. Equally good with three or four; okay with five. Evil fun!

Oh fillers, I really just need to find a few and stick with them instead of always looking for the best filler that gives me the same feeling as playing an 1+ hour game. No Thanks! does what it’s supposed to very well. Your goal is to have the fewest points at the end of the game. You have a deck of 33 cards numbered 3 through 33 and each player is given 11 chips (all worth -1 point). One card is dealt at a time and you can either take it (getting points, bad) or you can put a chip on it (losing a negative point). When you take a card, you also take all of the chips and there are points where you may have to take a card you otherwise might not want to. However, if you have a straight (e.g. 34 and 35) then you only count the lowest of the cards for points.

We played twice and I lost both times, coming somewhere near last place, but I really enjoyed the decisions you have to make and the risk you run in letting a card you want go around the table to gain more chips.

Recommended.

RATING: 7
This is a great filler game, and it helps get more traditional card gamers into hobby gaming. The game plays by giving each player to accept or pass the current card by placing a chip on it. If a player runs out of chips they must accept the card and a player accepting a card receives all of the chips on it. At the end of the game (once all of the cards have been collected) points are scored for the total of the lowest card in each sequence minus the number of remaining chips, and the player with the lowest number of points wins.

RATING: 7.1
Under-rated game.  Sweet spot is a four player game.  Scores can really swing, making the game quite exciting.  The "swingy" nature to the game is not, as with other games, a negative attribute.  In fact, it's what makes the game appealing -you never really know at the beginning of the game just how it will turn out.  A little bit of luck, a little bit of brazen courage, and a little bit of common sense is required!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game if you are looking for something easy to learn and fast. There's not much to it but it can be lots of fun! Like Roll Through the Ages, it can become boring if played too frequently in a short period of time but also has an element of classic appeal. Overall, it's good- simple and highly enjoyable, on many levels.

Not a bad filler, and certainly would improve by playing multiple hands. I think the removal of 9 cards from the deck makes it a bit too random, as you never know if it will even be possible to fill out that 34-high card you just got and want to connect to the 32 you got earlier.

Fun filler. Requires at least 3 but comes out a lot at start and end of gaming nights.

Playing with my girls recently.

I find it well balanced and scales from 3+ effectively. This is a very well designed game. The only negative about it is that it is fairly light. Most of the strategy is of the known your opponent kind. It is fairly easy to know how you should value cards but the trick is knowing how far to push your opponents.

Really thought No Thanks! had more of a strategy to it at first.  However, with the fact that you remove as many as 9 cards to start with, as well as the chips one is holding being the major factor in whether he picks up the card or not, make the game seem like an exercise in futility.  My first play did not fill me with desire to try it again any time soon.

Rated 9 after two plays.

My wife and I are working on a two-player variant.  So far, I haven't won... :(

Edit:  I have won now.  Still working on the variant.

--After discussion with a buddy of mine and playing it with more than two players a bit more, I really need to rethink the variant.

--Another variant that my buddies and I have tossed around is allowing players to throw in more than one chip to excuse themselves from the bidding with the possibility that another player could throw in more chips to force the other player back in and excuse themselves in exchange.  We haven't tried it yet so I'm not sure how this will work.

After 20+ Plays: So very simple, and yet enjoyable.  After you get a sense how to play, it basically comes down to two parallel push-your-luck elements.  Will you risk taking, for example, the 25 when you have the 23, in hopes that the 24 will come up later.  Secondly, how long will you pass on a card you need/doesn't hurt you, in the hopes of gaining more chips.  That's pretty much all there is to it, but in practice that's enough to make a really great filler.

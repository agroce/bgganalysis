Grew up playing a version of the game, so I'm quite fond of it. We play 'Auction Pitch' w/ partnerships, 6 card hands, and 3-4 points available (High, Low, Jack, Game).
  See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_(card_game)

Still a blast to play with my family and a great intro to bid/trick-taking card games (like Spades).

It looks like there are about a million variants of this game.  The one my wife's family introduced to me and regularly plays around the holidays is "Buck Pitch."  Partnership, 4P, 5-card hands.  Four possible points: high, low, jack, and game.  Bidding starts left of dealer, must bid higher than the previous one or pass.  Dealer forced to bid two if nobody bids.  A successful 4-bid is an instant win provided your score is not negative.  I can expand a bit more if somebody somehow gets interested.  Anyway, it's quick and fun!

Fun, shorter trick-taking game.  Slightly more chance and less card-counting, since not all cards are dealt at the beginning of each round.  If all I've got is a deck of cards and a small group, I go for Setback almost every time.

There are several different flavors of Pitch, but my favorite is probably Seven Point Pitch, which is played exactly like Ten Point Pitch (see the game description) except without the three. With five players, Ten Point Pitch call-your-partner is also quite fun. We used to play with my grandparents a lot when I was young.

I'm not a huge fan of trick taking games, and this one just didn't do anything for me.  I also felt like there were just a bunch of rules tacked on.  For some reason, the jack of the same color as the trump suit is also a trump card, and for some reason jokers are better than 10's but less than jacks.  And then 2's are an automatic point you don't even have to fight for, and so on...

I dunno, just totally illogical rules that interfere with the game play for me.  I suppose you'd just get used to it over time, but I didn't enjoy it enough to bother.

A trick-taking card game that I like better than most. I like the idea of having to capture certain cards. Kind of the antithesis of Hearts, where you avoid the Queen. Problem I have with this is I don't know what the actual rules are. There are so many variations among the people I play with, I can't any consistency. All variations are fun though.

We play slightly different rules. Most often played in  partnership. There are 18 points each hand. The 9 of trumps is worth 9 points and the 5 of trumps is worth 5 points. 9 cards dealt to all players. No other cards are involved. There is no trading or picking from the undealt cards. You can bid from 3 to 18. Never sure if all trumps or if the 9 or the 5 has been dealt out. We play to 100 points.

[Original comment] This is my favorite card game, which I've played for almost 50 years. There are many variations (almost as many as Poker has). One of my favorites is a 6-handed, two-teams version with 3 cards face-up in front of each player (as part of their 9-card hand). Bidding in Pitch is simple; making the bid is not.

May 2009 -- I cannot recall the last time I played Pitch, but it is still my all-time favorite card game. My wife and I have always liked it, but our family just never enjoyed it, so we don't bring it out.

(November 2011) In this year, our grandson became interested in learning Pitch. He very quickly became an excellent player. He enjoys playing 3-hand with my wife and me. This has led to some fun 4-hand games, by adding his dad. Additionally, we have interested in our son in it, and have enjoyed some 3-hand games with him. Maybe we will see Pitch played more in the future. We now have six interested players, and I need to teach them the 6-hand game.

November 2012 -- We only play Pitch occasionally, but I have great memories of playing it most of my life.

Grew up playing this game with my parents, siblings, aunts and uncles, cousins... Many different variations that don't change the game itself but just your approach to it.

I’m not sure how much of this rating is based on nostalgia, but *I loved playing this game.* 

The version of Pitch I grew up playing scores points for High, Low, 4 Jacks (includes Jack, off-Jack, and a high and low Joker), and the Game. We also played with a "widow" that the high bidder got before discarding down to x-number of cards. It's possible we also allowed all to discard-and-draw back after trump was called, though this is more hazy to me... complicated by my memory of trumps only being revealed when the high bidder played the first card.

There are a gazillion different variations it seems, and unfortunately I’m not sure if I’ll ever be able to piece together my exact ruleset since 1) It’s been decades since I played, and 2) Most everyone I ever played with has passed on. (Yes, I was that kid playing playing with my mom and grandparents.) Wikipedia has a pretty good rundown of the variations, by the way.

I’ve been playing a good 3-player version with Sarah and Kristianne: 6 cards dealt, high-low-jack-game, pitcher’s first card played is trumps, players must always follow suit but trumps can be played anytime. Pitcher gets number of points won regardless of bid, or loses number of points bid. Others get points they won. Play to 7, 11, or 21.

Anyone who doesn't think that 4 player / 10 point pitch has a lot of strategy, isn't playing the game right. One hand you will bid 6 on a 2, 3, 10 & jack hand, and make 7 or 8. Then the next hand you will bid 6 on an Ace, King and Queen, and you go set. Also, the game that I played was the Central Nebraska version. All of the rules are the same except: After bidding, the deal stays with the dealer; the winning bidder (like all other players) must discard all non-suit cards before the second deal (this allows you to see how many cards the winning bidder bid on); ALL players draw back to 6 and then the winning bidder gets the remainder of the deck (he/she can't pass it to partner); Any point card that is accidentally discarded goes to the winning bid teams score, but are not played; discarded non-point cards stay out of play; The high joker is the first one played in a hand (not designated before hand); we play to 36 points. Also, if the winning bidder has more than 6 cards in his/her hand after the second draw/blind, then he/she has to burn cards to get down to six before he/she leads (the burned cards are placed under the first card led, so everyone can see them). This burning of cards can really hurt, because non-point cards must be burned first, then non-point face cards next, then the deuce and finally any point cards other than the three. Any burned points count towards the high bidders final score. I've had to burn a king or a queen before and went set because of it. Ouch!

5 player / call partner has been mentioned but no one has posted instructions, so here they are. The rules are the same as above with the exception of: each player gets 10 cards and the remaining 4 cards go to the winning bidder to fill out his/her hand; all players must discard down to 6 cards (some are dummy cards) including the dealer (see above rules for burning cards); the winning bidder calls for the card that they want and whoever has this card becomes the winning bidder's partner and he/she scores the same points as the winning bidder; the winning bidder may choose to play the hand alone and if successful, receives double the amount bid; score is kept for each individual and is played to 52 points. Bids of 8, 9, & 10 are not uncommon in call partner. Not as fun as 4 player / 10 point but is good when you have 5 people.

RATING: 7
The rules as given are NOT the rules that I always used when playing four-point Pitch, but they're close enough.  Twelve-point Pitch is even better, where the points are high, low, jack, off-jack, jokers, five, and game. Anyone with a normal deck of cards 'owns' this game.

Favorite of my in-laws, so I've played several times.  Enjoyable trick taker, but I can't shake the feeling that there are close to no decisions to make other than whether to bid or not.  The rest of each round feels sort of programed.

I grew up in Central Nebraska, so of course I grew up playing there. I can't even begin to count how many games of 10-point Pitch I have played. We talk about games that happened when I was 10 years old (like when my mom had A-K-Q, bid 4 and still went set).

It's not a game of kings, and it's not the best trick-taking game ever played, but I still love playing it. And my 9-year old is learning to play. Great stuff.

Pitch is game about winning certain cards in tricks and there are so many variants it's not even funny, but they split into 2 main groups, ones played with all cards dealt and ones played with only trump cards. The former is more luck based and depends heavily on initial evaluation. The latter allows for potentially more interesting card play but it usually devolves into a standard format. The bidding is a simple raise and then declare trumps, play is quick and the game has strong social and gambling overtones.

My favorite traditional card game by far, and the best trick taking game out there, in my opinion.

I play by different rules than those on BGG, which seem to be pretty standard in Central New York based on my friends also knowing these rules:

-6 card hands (can get a new hand by revealing a hand with no face cards)
-4 points per hand: high trump, low trump, Jack of trump, and "game" (game points are 1/2/3/4/10 for J/Q/K/A/10 of any suit; whoever has the most game points gets the single "game" point for that hand)
-Games go to 21 points
-Bidding 4 is allowed; shooting the moon is getting 4 AND taking every trick; shooting the moon is an instant win if successful and reduces your score to -4 if unsuccessful (or stays the same if you're below -4)

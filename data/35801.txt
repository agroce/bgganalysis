This game got compared to a number of tile games, including Carcassonne - but that is simple done from ignorance.  the game is truly unique and ends it similarity with both games using square tiles.  This title is far more tactical and constrained in its area control.  Since play is limited to specific zones, and scoring options within a zone are tightly controlled, the game feels tighter and tenser.  The draw back is the wild cards that can come up at the worst/best times.  Its hard to protect against them which leads one to think there is a balance issue.  I'm not convinced that is the case as experience will lead you to watch them closely.  And there are tactics to minimize the impact.

Lungarno was a title I ignored at Spiel 2008 on purpose for I knew I could try it at a Dutch fair a few weeks later. I didn't really know very much about the game, only that a cursory read through the rules had me thinking [i]Carcassonne[/i] with extras. Unfortunately, when I did get a chance to try it, the rules explainer made a cardinal blunder and forbade us to put in more merchants of our own in the same district—this is allowed provided you put the merchants on different shields. If you are not allowed to do this, the game is brought to its knees due to an awful blind guessing element. My experience was therefore one of 'Well, you played something, but it wasn't Lungarno!' I'm waiting out for another chance so I can properly rate this game. (It speaks volumes of the game's 'qualities' that this hasn't happened for—at the time of writing—three years now.)

Doesn't feel like Carcassonne at all to me. I know you put a meeple down on a tile but I'm not building anything, I'm influencing.  I like earning coins instead of points and the special tiles add more strategy. It's a pleasant game that I'm keeping.

Drags really badly with 5 players and planning ahead (with 5 players) is almost impossible.

Probably would be better with 2 players, but the game is entirely based on scoring areas (rows, columns and blocks). This area scoring is bland and has been done to death. Nothing great or new here.

Working tile laying game, with undeniable ties with Carcassonne. Poor graphics, some unbalanced, too aggressive tile powers (thus causing king/kill making: it looks like this is a signature feature on Mura's games, since both Easy School and the following Jerusalem are prone to King/kill making).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
A simplistic, heavily luck-influenced tile placement game, where the players are really hamstrung on tile choice and placement.  Players try to construct (i.e. place) buildings in districts which match a specific family's crest or else constitute a majority column or row.  One of five different family crests are dealt randomly to each of 4 to 6 districts.  Players try to lay matching building tiles in that district, but are unable to peek at the family crest unless - and after - they have placed a tile. H'mmm... This is pure silliness. Well you may luck-out and earn double points if the placed building matches, you probably haven't and will then likely have wasted a turn.  What was the point of that randomness?  There are a few other building types (parks, trading houses and cemeteries) you can build overtop of or next to placed tiles which will either benefit you or harm your opponent, but these are few and they are expensive with money always being so tight. Perhaps if there was more tile choice or available money there'd be more player options.  In the end, it has a tic tac toe feel, where you draw a tile, place it in one of the little 2x6 districts and hope your house tile will ultimately match the family crest at final end of game scoring.  That's basically it and I didn't feel there was much opportunity to try any strategies or even tactics.  Like Tic Tac Toe, the optimal move is usually self-evident.  The construction theme I suppose sort of works, the building drawings are adequate, but the muted, faded colours don't do this game any favours. There are many more fun tile placement games and in the end this one was a disappointment.

RATING: 8
Underrated game. Bears only a superficial resemblance to Carcassone and is better than Carcassonne. There's more strategy, with the options to buy tiles and extra action at the expense of VPs, adding depth to the game. It can come down to the wire, which makes for an exciting game.

Another tile and worker placement game, with slightly dull isometric graphics, but the end result is another good game! I did like it, despite spending too much during the game. The gameplay seems very simply, but we forgot the important rule that a worker blocks a family within a district, so we started over. It works out well, with the best strategy seeming to be to fill a district by yourself as fast as possible. The extra cost of another go or higher tiles is nicely done, it drains enough from your purse to make you consider the balance of decisions. Definitely try Lungarno and if you find it well priced, grab it on sight.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Easy rules, nice-looking, plays less than an hour, good filler/family game.  If a lapse in time between plays, a couple minutes review is all it takes. 

Does seem a little expensive for the components--the wooden merchants are great, but the board is almost non-existent.  The attractive tiles are nice & thick, just not a lot to the game.  The smallish box could be half the size.

Re-playability because the tiles are placed differently every game.  Often multiple choices for strategy, but wasn't a brain burner.  

Some distant similarities to Carcassonne, but with easier scoring.  It's a tighter game.  Interactive too, because I found myself breaking off my own plans in order to stop someone from running away with high scores. If you let players do their own thing, you'll often lose.

It is staying on my game shelf.

Lungarno is an interesting tile-placement game that most people probably won’t enjoy as Carcassonne, but I found to be a welcome alternate take on the mechanic.  It feels a little more interactive in that almost every tile placed could impact the scores of my opponents. I like how victory points can be spent to take additional turns - knowing when to do this can be crucial. I also like how points can be used to replenish one’s hand with better tiles when the lone free tile available isn’t as desirable. I think this is an underrated title that deserves another look from non-casual gamers who enjoy a bit of tile-placement now and then.

An entirely abstract tile-layer, a kind of Carcassonne without the charm. Blind scoring is a big downer here, it's quite possible to 'get lucky' with the first tile placement in a district and this together with the arbitrary player screwage introduced by the 'graveyard' and 'office' tiles creates a game that's so bland, it's instantly forgettable.

First played March 26th, 2009. Taught in 10min, played in 30+ minutes with 4 players. This game seems to have more luck than strategy as it depends on what you draw and what other players are doing. It's a good filler game that isn't too complex to understand or play. Each player is given 5 pawns, 14 VPs and a starting hand of two tiles. On your turn you can draw a tile or play a tile. If you draw, you can take the 1st for free, 2nd for 1VP, or the 3rd for 2VPs. When a tile is taken each moves down and a new tile replaces the 2VP slot. A main canal and street board is created and you place tiles next to the streets or the canal or another tile. There are 8 regions when six tiles can be placed. Once a region is filled up, it is scored. A bonus (privledge) tile is turned over and the flag owner of the same gets 1 or 2 VPs. Tiles are a tower (get VPs for all like shields next to the closest street you are adjacent; decide if equaldistant), a plazza (gets VPs for all like shields in the same row), shop tile (+1VP for orthogonally placed pawns), church (-2VP for orthogonally placed pawns), 1 or two shield type tiles(1VP for each like shield in that region) or a office tile (swap/replace a tile in an un-pawned, uncompleted district with this one and take the other into your hand). You may place a pawn on any shields that doesn't have a pawn on that sheild type in a region and peek at the privledge card.

I took this game in Essen Spiel 2008.
At first sight, I thought that it was a Carcassone-like game but... WRONG!
It's a really good game, where luck is overwhelmed by tactics and long-time strategy.
In a 5-players game luck is a bit more consistent, but it's a little fee to pay for smart and functional rules, and well designed graphics, which I feel really elegant.

It's a good gateway game, not so difficult to learn but deep enough to be replayed several times.

Thumb up!

Technically functioning, Lungarno is the sort of souless game that will send the AT crowd screaming to the trenches.  We do not live in a world that requires another Carcassone variant, so why publish one? Also, the graphical presentation leaves a bit to be desired.  The perspective on buildings etc, had our group constantly asking "what does that building do again?"  At the end of the day, no one much cared.

Perhaps a slightly deeper Carc style game in which you choose to do 1-2 actions on your turn - purchase or placing a tile.  Second action costs an extra coin and tiles may cost $1-2 more as well if you don't take the free one.  Score shields in each town square as it is completed or put a merchant of yours in a special building which scores at the end only and keeps the merchant meeple unavailable and unreturnable to you (like the shepherd in Carc).  Most money wins the game.  Ultimately, I'm just not certain it is different enough from Carc to just not play Carc!

A simple tile-laying game that's very reminiscent of Carcassonne. There are some additional tactical options like deciding what tiles to take, deciding if you want to pay for another action, etc, but I never got the feeling that I got more control than in Carcassonne because of the limiting playing field. 

Couple this with the rather boring graphics, and I don't think this is a terribly compelling game. It isn't bad, but it's not great either.

Jugat a dos jugadors. M'ha encantat i vull tornar a jugar!

Un joc que pot semblar-se inicialment al Carcassonne per tenir rajoles i peons, però realment i a l'hora de jugar no es semblen tant.

En primer lloc es juga amb diners i aquesta quantitat de diners al final de la partida esdevindrà també els punts de victòria. Després, es juga delimitant el tauler en sectors (6 per a 2 jugadors i 8 per a 3, 4 i 5). D'altra banda, hi ha certa informació amagada abans de posicionar-nos en cadascun dels sectors (quelcom diferent i que funciona molt bé en el desenvolupament del joc). Per últim, hi han rajoles especials (botigues, torres, places, esglèsies i cementiris) que serveixen per intentar minvar o augmentar la puntuació dels mercaders que anem situant a cadascuna de les rajoles.

La mecànica de compra de rajoles i la opció de pagar una moneda per poder fer una acció més són factors que s'han d'aprofitar molt bé durant la partida.

La relació inicial de 14 monedes i 2 rajoles per jugador és correcta, i el màxim de 5 rajoles a la mà i de 5 mercaders col·locats sobre el tauler per jugador també està molt ben ajustat.

Felicitats per aquest petit gran joc Michele Mura!

Yes, it feels very Carcassonne-y, but it plays differently enough that if you're the type that looks forward to each new Carc expansion and variant, it's worth your time.

My biggest complaint is that the end game bogs down to a point where only a few tiles have any value to any particlar player and how they come up in the turn order can have a big effect on things.

A few more plays are needed to decide the game's final rating and ultimate place in my collection - the fact that I look forward to those plays is a positive sign for now.

Lungarno inherits the main principles of Carcassonne and adds a very intriguing background. 
The game is very simple and fast to explain and can be played by everyone.

If also longevity will be at the same level, Lungarno will stand among other games.

RATING: 6
Based on one play: The scoring system drives where you place your tiles, but you cannot try and fill an area on your own, you need help form others in order to get your player pieces back (which happens when an area scores) and then use them again. There are also tiles that only score at the end, but that commits you piece till the end, so make sure it is worth it and watch out for the tile that swaps pieces. Worth a try.

Similar to Carcassonne, there's tile laying and meeples that you either get back during the game when a district is finished, or at the end of the game for squares and towers... ok game, nothing special.

With 5 players, there was hardly any option to play tactically. While the other players had the option to score points, because they were able to get the right tiles, two players were only able to get 'special' tiles like church (which is of no use without the normal building tiles). Where other players scored more and more points, the game was no fun for me well before games' end.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game with a decent bit of thematic atmosphere, but the tiles are hard to recognize and analysis paralysis can also set in if you play with those inclined in that direction. Otherwise, excellent.  

To ease learning, we started with only certain special tiles having their effect; the others were "wilds" of whatever color the player wanted.

If you enjoy tile-layers, give this one a try!

This felt like a Carcassonne variant: tile placement, meeples to optionally place on that tile, variable scoring mechanisms for each tile type. There's more, of course: defined board layout, special tiles, Showmanager-style tile drafting, and semi-hidden bonus points. The game plays quickly and should be reasonably priced. Still, it feels like a Carcassonne variant which may or may not be a good thing. Maybe they should license the brand?

It plays very well with 2 or 3 players but I think it takes a bit (only a bit) too much time. It's a simple game, components are not very good but they work fine, the artwork is lousy on taste. It has some randomness on the tiles and this can be frustrating sometimes. It's challenging enough to see the table now and then. 

I prefer to play it with two players.

Middling tile laying game, obviously based on Carcassonne. It seems the author had problems with the luck of the draw in Carcassonne, so instead you can buy additional tiles and choose when you place them.
I've never had much problem with Carcassonne in that respect. Lungarno shows that it's actually better to just draw one and place it rather than buy several and choose when to place them. It adds a lot of unnecessary downtime. It takes a lot longer to place Lungarno's 50-ish tiles than the 70 of the base Carcassonne.
I'll try this once or twice again, but I don't expect my rating to rise.

I rate this game a 3 because honestly, its very boring.  Mechanically it works.  But there's no spark.  There's nothing to make me say "Yeah, I'd play this again."  I'm pretty sure I won't.  I thought about rating it a 4, but that means I could be talked into it.  I'd rather not play this again.

I think I've learned a valuable lesson that has taken quite a while to learn:  If someone says that a game is like Carcassonne, they basically mean that it has tiles.

About [thing=35801][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=35801][/thing] is a tile placement in which players build the district of Lungarno, in Pisa, in order to attend the richest families with their merchants. But don't mind this - [thing=35801][/thing] has little theme.

What it do has is good mechanics, making it surprisingly easy to teach and to play. It reminded me of [thing=822][/thing], a lot, but with much more strategy and control by the players, as the tiles are bought and placed when choosen by the players. It sure is a (small) step up in depth and options, but not enough to make [thing=35801][/thing] complicated or brain-burning.

There interaction is closely the same: trying to build something (squares) to yourself and see others wanting to take advantage of what you already done, or to make the place worst, by adding a Church and/or a Cemetery.

Overall, [thing=35801][/thing] was a good surprise: I was expecting a weak game, due to its ranking and comments, but ended up with a pleasant and quick to play option, one that I can introduce to those in my group that like [thing=822][/thing] and wish for a little more complexity.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Every player starts with some ducats (money) and a tile. The goal is to have the most money by the end of the game. During their turns the players have two options:

a) Buy a tile. There are, normally, three tiles open for purchase, costing 0, 1 or 2 ducats (depending on its position in relation to the draw pile - the closest, the latest it was revealed, and higher will be its cost);

b) Place a tile. The player chooses one of the squares and put the tile. When placing a tile, the player can put an merchant on it, if possible. Usually the tiles have two family shields, and the person chooses one to put the merchant. This family will be blocked for all other players in this square of Lungarno. A merchant can only be put on the tile just placed.

After doing one of the above actions, the person can pay 1 ducat in order to done another action, which can be the same already done. A player can't have more than 5 tiles in hand - if the player has 5, the only action allowed is to place a tile.

Once a square is full (with 6 tiles), it is scored. The privilege token is revealed (this token has 2 symbols for one family and one for another). Players receive ducats equal to the number of shields of the family they have a merchant attending (also adding those of the privilege token) - this amount can be increased and/or reduced by the effects of some tiles. There are tiles that are only scored at the end of the game, and if there is a merchant on them, it remains there for the rest of the game, and isn't scored at this moment. All merchants on tiles that are scored, return to their owners, to be used again later on.

When the last square is filled, it is scored as usual, then the game ends. Tiles that are scored at the end of the game give ducats now.

The player with the most money will be the winner!

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which place to put a tile - this takes into consideration what already have been put in the squares, which shields are open, and the effect of the tiles. Usually this decision isn't hard, but sure is key in order to do well;

Which tile to buy - this is two-fold: the cost and what it is. Some tiles have special effects, such as reducing or increasing the income when a square is scored; others can net big money at the end, but lock a merchant; most will be tiles with the shield of two families, meaning that you won't be able to take advantage of both when placing (as you can only add one merchant at a time), however, you can try to place in a square in which you already supply to the other family, thus increasing the value received by your other merchant, and leaving room to take control of other family. But this won't always be possible, and give points to someone else might be necessary in order to free some merchants.

The decisions in [thing=35801][/thing] aren't difficult nor require too deep of a thought, but they matter and allow for interaction and some strategy mixed with tatical decisions.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy to teach and to play;
- Language independant and colorblind friendly;
- Enough player control of their own path, but with some randomness to increase replay value;
- Playable in around 45 minutes - good pacing with little downtime.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Has some destructive interaction (by decreasing value), which may allow a bit of bash the leader;
- The building part, as the heart of the game, isn't truly neat, from a construction point of view, as you don't get to build something to be proud of, just a good square to score, that sure is similar to all the others;
- Luck of the drawing in tiles can bother some players, but the game balances this somewhat by making the newly revealed tile the most expensive;
- The colors and overall graphic design aren't much attractive.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
As playing the grow up version of [thing=822][/thing]. I tried to come up with a better way to describe it, but this is the best one, as [thing=822][/thing] is so well known that I'm confident you will understand what I mean. Sure, there are other games that also fit this bill, like [thing=176494][/thing]. But I didn't went to play [thing=35801][/thing] looking for this, and had I known before how the feel and even the straightforward gameplay are present, I would went to [thing=35801][/thing] sooner, as I sure like games that let me build stuff - yet, this feel, of building a unique and pleasant to the eye, isn't truly there, which is sad.

In the end, in spite of its drab look, [thing=35801][/thing] satisfied me more than expected: the pace is lively, the decisions have weight without inducing to AP, there is a fine amount of room to develop an shallow strategy coupled with tatical choices. Recommended.

Tile-placement game, reminiscent of Carcassonne in the use of the merchants, but more complex. Another game that didn't leave a particularly positive impression.

While clearing out the game room in an effort to fit everything on the shelves (ha!), I ran across [b][i]Lungarno[/i][/b] and after a peek at BGG I was surprised to discover that I've played this game seven times. That quantity shouldn't be a surprise, I suppose, but it is, which suggests that the game doesn't have much memorable about it, which suggests that it should make way for something else that might have more spark, which is what happened.

A straight-up variation on Carcassonne with more strategy.  Get this to play when you want less luck.

Not really bad, but well I don't have the feeling to replay the game. Artwork is meh and well that helps getting games replayed, somewhat sad really.

While still quite tactical, I find it more strategic than the base Carcassonne game.

O no, not another solid game! We have enough of them. Almost impossible to refuse adding it to your collection, because it is a solid game. Almost impossible to get to the table, because it’s just a solid game, and I want to play a great game. The theme doesn’t add anything to the game. Rules are easy to explain and teach. I would call this a medium filler.

The game is a classic tile-placement game... but with some things I do like and which make the game enjoyable.
First: you can have 5 tiles in your hand.
Second: the game is limited in his space because you can play only in those eight districts near Arno.
Third: interaction is the key-word - you have to break other player's play... if you don't, you will surely lose...
Graphic is fine and inherent with the environment; it's not astonishing and it's very linear.

Especie de Carcassonne en el cual hay distritos. Cada mercader del jugador puede proveer a una sola familia. La loseta en la que esté el mercader indicará el método de puntuación.

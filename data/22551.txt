GAME: Risk: Star Wars Original Trilogy Edition
RANK: 1803
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
This is a surprisingly good version of RISK. The different win conditions and starting armies for the different factions make the game asymmetric and feel a lot different from classic RISK, in a good way. The extra bits like ships, the card effects, and the Death Star are nice and thematic. With the different win conditions, it is shorter than classic RISK as well. Really good and worth getting/playing if you like RISK and Star Wars.

I love this game. I've only played it twice  ( and lost twice as the Empire ) and I'm beginning to wonder if the game is broken due to the fact that the light rebel player gets to move the force marker every time he conquers a dark side Base.

It eliminates the annoying aspects of Risk (long game, too much dice rolling) and adds in some well implemented Star Wars themes: Death Star, Force Meter, Bounty Hunters.  Well done, best of the themed Risk games.

The only 'Risk' variant I've somewhat enjoyed thus far. The scenario play rules (variable win conditions for every faction) were actually quite thematic and made the resolution of the game more interesting. Still average RISK mechanics, though.

RATING: 7
Superior to the Clone Wars Edition. The Risk rules do not interfere with the Star Wars theme, which is put to good use through the use of separate card decks for each faction. The faction specific victory conditions seem balanced and add to the theme. An excellent lite sci-fi wargame.

Great Risk Game! Great Additions, and very balanced. Sure to have many close games.

There is a typo on "I'll Take Them Myself" which makes it the cheapest card EVER, but besides that, it is a great game to play. Like all risk games, you need a group of skilled players to really enjoy it.

Excellent grafting of theme onto Risk mechanics. Surprisingly well balanced and far less dice-dependent than might be anticipated by those who learnt to play vanilla Risk as a child. Some genuine tactical considerations, and with three factions chasing unique agendas, a real challenge for experienced gamers while offering a theme-rich and enjoyably light game for non-gamers.

RATING: 7
A solid light Star Wars war game. RISK has just enough to keep you engaged generally, and the special additions that apply to Star Wars take it up a notch. Having the old formula take place within a Star Wars context is already an improvement for fans of the universe, and building forts, ships and Death Stars can't hurt, can it? A very good game if you don't expect too much.

Love this version of Risk! Relates very nicely to the theme. Best as a three player game. The balancing act is the charm of this game. The three different winning conditions of the three factions is brilliant.

In our one game, the Hutts came right up the middle to win the game as the Rebels and the Imperial Empire were fighting each other.

One of the most attractive Risk boards, second only to Godstorm. Much better than the ugly Clone Wars board.

Nice variations on the standard Risk game make this one pretty playable.  I like the different goals of the three factions, and I enjoy various uses of the cards.  A fair amount of Star Wars theme in there, too.  Ultimately, though, it is still Risk.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
This game does an excellent job of capturing the "feel" of the original trilogy.  The Empire feels unstoppable and the Rebellion feels desperate throughout the game.  The Hutts' influence is negligible.

The Death Star is a very nice bit of chrome, as is the "Force Meter" and the multiple uses for each card make for tough decisions.

Great game, but the play time seems WAY wrong on this. At least with my group, thirty minutes would only be achieved if one of the three factions got obliterated surprisingly early in the game. Perhaps a 2 or 4 player game (with neutral Hutts) might be under an hour. I would rate this game an 8 if the real play time was not so long. The longer-than-anticipated play time means we won't be pulling this down off the shelf as often as we otherwise would.

9/4/09: Bumping rating from 7 to 8, based on the game's STRONG performance as a 3-player game, which I'd never played before last night. With any other number of players, this game would still rate a 7, but with 3 players it comes alive.

2/22/10: Another defining play of this game proves my "8" rating to be true with EXACTLY 3 players. This is an outstanding game for 3 players. The Hutts win again!

Best three player version of Risk; no question I'd pick this one if that's how many people we had.  Rebels are definitely the underdog, but they can still win (I've done it). I most enjoy playing the Hutts, but all positions are fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
UPDATE: Played with 5 the other day, and it worked out pretty well. On the minus side, the game is a little longer (although it still came in at 2 hours), and with more downtime. On the plus side, having 5 players instead of 3 led to a more stable game with more back and forth and less of a feeling that the player who was insufficiently picked on will win. I was nervous about the downtime, but it didn't seem too bad, even though we had one slow player. All versions of Risk are pretty light, and should be played at a good clip, and this falls into that category. Like some other "classic" games, hobbyists may overthink what is basically a game of pressing your luck, taking your chances, and rolling the dice (thus the well-chosen name). One nice thing about the extra neutral player in the 5-player game is that if one Imperial or Rebel player gets eliminated, the Hutts sort of step into the role of the eliminated player and allow the game to retain some balance and interest for the (likely short) remainder of the game, while in the Clone Wars version an eliminated player equals a loss for that side (in most cases ... a late Order 66 may balance things), albeit one that still might take a while to play out.

Anyway, all in all the 5-player game was quite fun and probably better-balanced than the 3-player version. Just make sure it moves along.

Play Hint: The initial claiming of planets is critical. Players need to a) try to keep their forces consolidated, b) deny anyone (especially Rebel Player 1) a region on turn 1, and c) try to retain frontage with all the other players. Our side lost the last game we played because we let ourselves get boxed in by friendly planets, the Hutts, and Imperial bases, and had few avenues to attack and break up opponents' regions and power-bases.

During the game, the Force Meter is critical, and you need an extremely good reason to spend cards that have force-meter altering powers for anything other than moving the force meter. 

Anyway, a fun game with enough depth to be engaging and enough action to be fun.
---
I've played this a few times, and generally enjoyed it, but it shares the problem of most 3-sided wargames: it's not particularly stable. Everyone always has to keep an eye on the other two players, and someone always has to try to rein in the leader, but the player who wins will be the one (usually) who lets the other two fight.

In this case, it's the Hutts who I think cause some problems. Most players will focus on the great and highly-thematic Rebel vs. Empire conflict, but if the Hutts are left alone too long, they can steal a quick victory by grabbing 10 green planets without too much work; and it's hard to tell when they're cruising, because they don't show strength the way the others do (by controlling regions or generating lots of troops - they just need to control dispersed resource planets). All they have to do is sit there and accumulate troops and cards without attracting too much attention. Then they can drop a set of cards for troops, buy a ship, and go on a quick run to get the planets they need, while the Rebels and Imperials have much more taxing victory conditions.

I think the balance here is actually a little bit too fine. It might be a little bit *too* hard to keep everyone honest, for what is still a light-ish game, and one that as an adult you aren't going to play a ton of.

Also, the balance in the card decks is not quite there. Fighter cards are lousy, but no more common than Capital ships, and the events don't seem to be that balanced - some are quite powerful, some a little weak, there doesn't seem to be any coherency of strong ship/strong event or strong ship/weak event, and so a good/poor card draw can mar an otherwise good game, especially as you won't draw a ton of cards. 

But you know what? Despite all this I still find it quite fun and rather like it, would play it most days, and think it'll have staying power. It's got lots of theme, good cards, good gameplay, and, importantly, lots of fierce action as players fight over what feels like a very constrained space. While not short by euro standards (figure two hours start to finish), by the standards of the genre, it's quite compact. Measured up against the other games of this type that folks around here seem to like - Twilight Imperium, Antike, Nexus Ops, that sort of thing - this seems far superior. As I say, it's not a game I'll ever play a ton, but it has always been a good time, despite the fact that it hasn't always produced a balanced game, sometimes for no good reason.

I think this is really ideal for 3 players. If you have 4, I think the Clone Wars version has to be considered a better bet. With 5, I'd worry a bit about the downtime. I'd like to try it with 5 once, just to see if it works, but because of the I Go - You Go sequence of play, there just isn't a lot to do while you're sitting around awaiting your turn.

RATING: 4
My initial rating went down dramatically after a few more plays.  Basically, the Hutts will always win unless the Empire and Rebels cooperate to beat them down before turning on each other.  At that point, the Hutt player will either be bored or eliminated.  I was really excited about this game and the varying victory conditions, but it just didn't work out that well.

RATING: 7
Great for Star Wars fans. Actually not a bad version because it's designed for 3 players because there are three "factions," each of which has a unique win-condition. I sold this on eBay for a nice chunk of change, because I didn't really need three different versions of Risk, and this was my least favorite! (Risk: Godstorm and Risk 2210 A.D. are the others.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A light fast Star Wars multiplayer wargame is what I wanted and it is what I got. The risk engine is strategically a bit on the simple side. It is a pity that the different tokens just represent 1 or 3 generic troops. The alternative victory conditions for each faction make it feel like the rebel versus Empire struggle. The cards are nice: there is a lot of variety from adding modifiers to combat, allowing rerolls, adding new troops and allowing you to break certain rules. The Death Star and Imperial Bases are cool. The spaceships, which modify dice rolls, are another good addition. A good Star Wars wargame but at the same time I do look and think how cool a Star Wars wargame could be if you added in the wookies and used a deeper system like a Dune or Game of Thrones, Starcraft or War of the Ring.

It's Star Wars, dude.

Played a second time and "it's star wars, dude."

Third time, and while the SW factor makes it cool, the actual gameplay is great too.  The balance between three different roles is accomplished well.  Love the multi-purpose cards.  Best Risk game I've played.

 After playing four times now, I can't believe that people have found 852 games that they think are better than SW Risk - original trilogy. Are they high? This is a great game, and a perfect model of balancing different powers and win conditions. And it's a two hour game ... if you're slow. The cards can be used three different ways, the pieces are cool, and there's a "force-o-meter". Way cool.

I find Chaos in the Old World to be a similar option when we have four players.

Of the flavors of Risk, this seems like the best.  Great theme (of the only Star Wars trilogy worth watching), and a great scenario of rebels vs empire with a third player spoiler (each have their own objective).  Cool use of bases, ships, and bluffing (where is the Emperor?) and the Death Star can blow up a planet thus altering the board if it blocks a pathway from one sector to another.

Got it for Christmas 2006! Looks quite fun, and I hope to play it soon, and will rate it ASAP! The components are nice, and the map is more attractive than the one for the Clone Wars edition. The rules also appear a bit cleaner than the Clone Wars. This one is different enough in regards to victory conditions and theme to justify owning both this one and the earlier Clone Wars edition.

OK - after first play - I like it! It certainly plays differently than Clone Wars edition (in fact, more like Mission Risk). Four player game was quite fun, and I definitely see playing this one some more.

A great twist on the classic Risk, of course placed in the Star Wars universe. The faction cards offer a nice, fun variability (especially if you're the Hutts!) and the game doesn't drag for too long. I like the fact that everyone knows the goal of the other factions. I think it plays best with three, one per faction. Not bad at all!

Easily the best version of Risk I've yet seen, it takes what could have been a cheap Star Wars cash-in (like the Monopoly style "themes" games), and instead makes it a relatively engaging space war game, with three asymmetrical factions, with varying goals, strengths, and weaknesses.  While its still Risk, with its over-reliance of luck of the roll, it definitely feels fresh and properly thematic.  Probably one of the few good uses of the Star Wars license in the past decade or so.

I have to admire how clean and simple the Risk combat system is.  After hours of trying to explain wargames to people it's fun to see how quickly players pick up campaigning in Risk.  It also has a freedom that I love in game, you can plop down your guys where you want and attack as long as you want.  No limited actions like in so many modern games.  It's a game system that lets you screw up, make bad moves and get eliminated.  Quite refreshing.  Star Wars Risk is lots of fun for me with the highlight being the Death Star, which can move around and wipe out entire planets.  I really like the card system which gives you many options on your turn.  Still fairly simple, but at least some options to consider.  It's still Risk and if you hate Risk you probably won't like it, but the Star Wars theme and chrome make it very fun to play, and Star Wars geeks will love all the planets, artwork, cards and spaceships.  Best of all it's about the first three movies- back when Star Wars was great!

Play tested this. Love the mechanics, love the game and of course the theme. I am not biased just because I love Star Wars. I would say it was bad if it was. The Hutt's play a large role in the outcome in this than in the first version we played. It works a lot better, making the 3rd player have a more important role in the outcome.

Didn't grab us like Prequel Trilogy did...feels more like basic Risk with extra gloss.  The absence of Order 66 is huge.  We didn't get to explore the Death Star dynamic a lot because honestly there are too few cards that deal with it; it became a glorified blocker.

Will have to play it more.  I think there's potential, and it's a good filler, but it's a bit of a letdown.

RATING: 6
I have been wanting to try this since I heard about it as I am not a Risk fan but I do like the idea that some designers have tried to beef it up a little. Plus, it's one of my favourite themes, so certainly that should help! I think Star Wars Risk (OTE) is probably the best anyone could do with the risk mechanic. Risk (of course) is 90% luck, and the designers here have added a variety of other 'lucky' and 'random' mechanics. However, they are lucky and random in the best way. I quite like how the cards can be used for three different things, and there is a critical decision that has to be made here. The card's special effects can be wildly swingy. There are some special powers for the Hutts, for example, that are overpowered and actually made me a little grumpy when played. But, it's sort of thematic that way, and one can tell a story about the brutal assaults throughout the universe. The added rules don't add that much in terms of complexity but just enough that this doesn't feel like the brain-wasting dice chucker that Risk is. Plus, the pieces and artwork were very well done.  All in all, however, I found myself bored after an hour (and we played for just under two). Much better than the eight hours Risk normally takes. I like that each player has a different goal, but I could see times where, like original Risk, a player could easily see that they are unable to win, but will still play out the game. Some random mechanics will make sure the 'best get bester' problem with Risk is wrenched every now and then, but sometimes the swings will put the top man in an even higher position.

Another Risk variant, but this one has several things that set it apart. First is the Star Wars theme. This is a definite plus to almost everyone who plays, myself included. Secondly is the multiple paths to victory. I haven't played enough yet to comment on how balanced the factions are, but they are a lot of fun. Special cards may be a bit overpowered in some cases, and there arent as many options as with 2210 AD. Still, this is a good game, and seems a bit quicker than most Risk variants. After several plays, I am wondering about the balance though. Winning as the Empire seems very difficult.

Wow!  A RISK with a not-merely-painted-on theme, and one that works well. Excellent update to the classic pre-Ameri-trash dice rolling extravaganza, with what seems like good balance (thought the Rebels were cleared up pretty quickly in my game).

The traditional Star Wars (meaning the original movie, now known as Ep IV A New Hope) and the 2 sequels introduced the Hutts, the Empire and the Rebels. Using the basis of the Imperial/Rebel struggle, and the backgrond of the Hutts trying to take advantage of the human sqabbles, this game features 3 viable, different power groups, who each seem to have a great chance to win.

A really nice 3-player game, based on (1) solo 3-player game, this kept close until the end, when the Death Star polishing off Nar Shaddaa kept the Hutts from claiming their 10th Resource world until after the Imperials finished wiping up the Rebels.

Received my copy today.  Was involved in the playtesting for this one, and it is a blast!  Plays very quickly for a Risk game, but not TOO quickly.  Interesting twist in that there are 3 different factions (Rebel, Empire, and Hutt) who have 3 different ways to win.  Empire wins like classic Risk by wiping out the Rebels.  Rebels win by taking the Imperial Base token that has the Emperor on it (like the leader tokens in Clone Wars Risk), and the Hutts win by controlling 10 of 13 special resource planets.  This leads to many differing strategies and chances for diplomacy as opposed to vanilla Risk or even Clone Wars Risk.  The Hutt faction makes for a really interesting and dangerous wild card.  Deal with them with caution.  They can assist your faction in trying to accomplish your goals, but can slip in and steal a win out from under you.  Each faction has its own deck of cards which have some very interesting and appropriate-to-each-faction effects.  The Rebel cards generally lean toward evacuations and surprise attacks, Empire cards deal more in brute force, and Hutt cards tend to be sneaky and subversive (like converting enemy troops or preventing attacks against them until another player is attacked first).  Similar in many ways to Clone Wars Risk, but radically different in others and there have been many refinements to that formula.  Best of all, the board is BEAUTIFUL!  Put the most skilled Risk player in charge of the Hutts as they are the most challenging group to play.  Empire plays more like regular Risk (win by domination) with the added horrific nastiness of the Death Star, and the Rebels are similar to post-Order 66 Republic in Clone Wars Risk(except they don't know EXACTLY where the Emperor is).  3 players seems to be the sweet spot, but works quite well with 5 (two Rebels allied, two Imperials allied, 1 Hutt).  Highly recommended!

First game was with a full comlpliment of five players. Two of us were in the Rebellion, fighting for truth, justice, and the Milky Way. Two of my opponents were faithful to the Empire; the lone remaining player looked out for his own gangster interests as the Hutt. We won as the Rebellion. It felt like REAL STAR WARS. We won the game in an act born of desperation - we blew up the death star and brought the vile Emperor to justice.

The Hutt player felt as if he were vastly outnumbered (he was) and doomed. We agreed to try the game again as a three-player game.

A few months later, we had made that opportunity. We learned that you cannot trust the Hutt - not only are they gangsters, but they won the game.

Note: The game has player elimination. While that did not happen, it was a concern. Now that I think about it, if either the Empire or the Rebellion lose, the game is over. So, the only player that could be eliminated early is the Hutt.

While still not a great game, this edition does a whole lot to improve upon the base formula. The asymmetric powers are fairly balanced from my experience with the game, and playing as each side evokes the nature of that faction surprisingly well. It still suffers from many of the downfalls of the parent game, but is an entirely commendable improvement. Plus it's Star Wars.

An excellent Risk game, second only to 2210 AD. The Star Wars elements are well-thought out and aren't just pasted on (like say SW Monopoly). The board is smaller and there are less troops which makes for a quicker game than other Risk variants.

Also, the 3-player objectives are well-balanced and make for an excellent fight on all sides. Unfortunately, since the game was designed for 3-players, the optional rules for playing it with any other number look very bland and boring.

Components are pretty average. Artwork is garish, as are the plastic pieces, but they are easy to distinguish and were obviously chosen to be practical. Would've liked some better pieces for the ships and the Death Stars, but overall, everything works well as is.

I cannot stand this game even though i love star wars. It made me not want to play any more games the rest of the night which is a amazing feat. Luck can overwhelm even the best of strategies and it is not fun. Being Incredibly bored the whole time as i was just sitting around is not what i call a good time. Also after like 2+ hours of effort i got destroyed in one move and felt like i just wasted my time for nothing, at least in other good games i can feel some sense of accomplishment.

Game broken? Despite many saying it can't happen or would be rare in my very first game the Empire player destroyed both entrance points to a system with the emperor, the Rebels could not get any more cards to get the one move through an asteroid field card to have a chance to win. The Empire could not move out to win either.

I like the varied victory conditions and other than the possible stalemate problem  for two players it played quite well.

ALL 3 player *****

[Total] 

Empire [12] [7-8]
Rebellion [9] [4-9]
Hutts [20] [8-4]

---------

A really great 3 player game... i cant think of any reason why i would ever play with any other number tho (if not least as i have far more games that i would want to play with 4 or 5).

The differing victory targets are what make this so interesting - so far it has been pretty even and in each game everyone has thought something like 'there is no way X can win this' only for them to suddenly come from nowhere to claim their target.

The only thing i don't like is the placement of the emperor. If he comes out early the rebels will be big favorites and if he comes out near the end it might well be all over before he is seen giving the rebellion no chance to win... a little odd.

Played it once. Would like to play it again, but difficult to find interested opponents. Basically a Risk combat system set in space to the Star Wars theme.

The rebellion is trying to do away with the Emperor.

First of all, this is still Risk.  The things not to like about Risk (simplistic combat, rich getting richer, relative advantages between Australia and Russia, etc.) are all still here.  That said, if you were to play Risk, this is the way.  This is Star Wars.  All of the flavour of the original trilogy comes through in full force, especially through the unique win-cons for each faction.  The Empire is oppressively strong, the Rebellion can make an impact if they don't over extend, and the Hutts just watch and reap the rewards of everyone else's work.  The minis that come with the game look great, the art on the board is strong without being intrusive, and the cards capture those moments from the movies you want to see.

Yet another fun, asymmetrical Star Wars Risk game, this time for 3 players.  Only played once, so I can't go into a detailed analysis about replayability or strategic depth or balance, but there's a lot going on here:  cards used as in CDG's, decks tailored to three different races, the Death Star, asymmetrical victory conditions, and neat events on the cards.  It's a delicate balancing act, as the three sides have to keep an eye on the others to make sure they are not helping their opponents.  It plays in 2-3 hours.  What's not to like?

This is an interesting 3 player version of Risk. However, playing the Hutts can be quite dull. As the conflict wages each turn between the Rebels and the Empire, the Hutt player simply waits. It is interesting that the three factions have different goals, different starting values and their own deck of faction specific cards but the level of conflict (and what else do you play Risk for?) is not balanced. The Hutts are only involved either when they are impeding the movement of one of the other factions or if they are able to position themselves to achieve their goal (10 resource planets); otherwise, they sit. This may sound more negative than it should. The game is good but provides a different feel and requires different strategies depending on the faction played. (Obviously I prefer the more aggressive factions.) It is a better addition to the Risk family than the Lord of the Rings games but not as good as Clone Wars. It makes a great companion to the Clone Wars version.

Nice, asymmetrical game that does a lot with the Star Wars theme. The three-player Original Trilogy game is solid--it uses Risk combat/reinforcement/resupply mechanics but has capital ships, bombers, and fighters to compliment ground forces plus the nice card actions for each faction. 

Better game than the newer SW Risk.

Fun, fairly quick (45 minutes once you learn everything) Star Wars game in which the Rebel Alliance tries to destroy the Death Star, and the Empire tries to defeat the Rebel fleet.

More fun than regular Risk.  The Star Wars rules are good.  Recommend you have 3 players for best results.  Probably the best Risk variant produced.  Maybe better than the original.

RATING: 8.5
A nice enjoyable game.  I like the "three teams" aspect of the game, and the different victory conditions for each side (especially the Hutts).  The gameplay is simple enough that it could be a good gateway-type game; it's enough like Risk that it's familiar to even non-gamers, but different enough to introduce them to more "complex" games.

RATING: 10
By far one of my favorite versions of Risk. It seems the least "Risk"-like of a lot of versions, which for me personally, is great. The fact that each faction has a distinctly different goal makes for interesting games, and causes some fun diplomacy between the players.

A good, compact rendition of the original Star Wars trilogy, and a (rare to find!) functioning 3-player light wargame. And yet, Risk's bland combat system (although some special units are introduced through the cards, all figures refer to generic troops, for instance) somewhat affects the enjoyment.

The best iteration of Risk I've yet to come across. Games tend to conclude within 60-90 minutes. 

I just wish the Galactic Empire had a more achievable winning condition such as capturing Rebel Bases. Instead they're tasked with conquering ALL Rebel planets, which probably will never happen because the players will simply call it "GG" when they see the Empire player running away with it.

If there's a better dudes-on-a-map game for three players than this one, I don't know what it is. Yes, it's Risk, but the way the cards and victory conditions lead the three different factions to play their roles makes you forget that.

I'm sure it would work with other numbers of players, but there are lots of good choices for those. With 3, it's tough to find a game that let's every player go all out for his own goals so well.

We have seen 3 straight Hutt victories at my house, but nobody seems to mind. The Hutts are the weakest faction, but have the easiest victory conditions. So far they have managed to lie in the weeds until the Rebels and Empire are at each other's throats, then sweep out to pick up their 10 planets at an opportune moment.

Hopefully that's one of those things for which experience will provide the remedy. I know I'll be looking to put a foot on their throat early the next time I play, however pitiful they may appear.

Seriously, how can anybody not like a game where the Empire has a death star that can obliterate planets, and the Rebels have a 'One in a Million' card that can feel like exactly that? If you get stuck with three Ameritrashers at the table even once in awhile, do yourself a favor and find a copy of this game.

RATING: 5
The Hutts as a third faction makes for an interesting dynamic which addresses the 3p problem head-on rather well. Each faction having their own victory condition is neat, though 2 of them essentially approach world domination. Thematically well enough done, feels like Star Wars, though the board strains the eye a bit. Cards are a little unbalancing, not in terms of their effects (though there are a few I would curate) as much as their quantity: at least 2 players can generally reliably draw 2-3 cards each turn which means nearly a set of bonus troops each turn. Overall this game shares a few too many problems with classic Risk for my liking, but if you're a Star Wars fan that likes (or at least doesn't mind) Risk you'll enjoy this game.

The different win conditions for the different factions make this a lot more interesting than regular Risk.  However, I can't rate it much higher since it still has the Risk combat mechanics (with minor modifications), which I don't like so much.  The board is a real eye-grabber, though.

A slightly modified risk variant that adds a cool galactic theme. Some of the add ons create a fresh new mechanic, while others (Order 66) offer such an unbalanced and  randomized twist, that it can truly alter a game for the worst.

Played with two. Good version of Risk with an attractive board and simple but effective components. Plays OK with two, but it is plain to see that it takes three players to make it really shine. Is a lot more streamlined than Risk 2210, so it has the advantage of being faster (faster also than the original Risk). The game really rewards offensive play. The different uses for each card you draw are great, and so are the bonuses that you can obtain by purchasing ships. Reminds me in some ways of LOTR Risk (a version that I like as well).
UPDATE: Gamelength varies wildly with three (just finished a game in my third turn!). But I think that's great for keeping everybody on their toes from start to finish :-).
UPDATE: After another game with three, I cannot see myself playing this game ever again. In a 3 player game, the rebels are at a great disadvantage, drawing less cards than both other players. And some of the cards are ridiculously powerful! The green player won within an hour, just by using the large number of cards in her possession, while the rebels did not even get the opportunity to purchase a single bomber. Prefer Lord Of The Rings Risk - will trade this away.

Risk with factions, and card trade-in doesn't scale up... which i think makes it marginally worse than normal Risk- however it's hard to tell, as the only game I played was won by the Hutt player before I could take my first turn.

This is my favorite of the new Risk variants and not just because I am a Star Wars geek. The new mechanics introduced in this version not only make sense thematically, but give everyone something to do besides just drop a pile of guys and invade. There's no trying to conquer the entire map here. All three sides have asymmetrical forces and completely different win conditions. The Empire can blow up planets to exterminate the rebels, the rebels must try to hunt down and assassinate the emperor. The Hutts just try to stay out of the way and steal their way to victory while the other two sides are busy chasing each other around. It's the most unique version of Risk I have ever played and by far the best.

Fantastic asymmetric three player game.

I'm a fan of the Risk family in general and this has got to be the best of the bunch.  Only a few extra moving parts, but they add a ton of theme and drama.  Cards can be used in several ways: traded in for dudes as usual, turned into ships (which give bonuses to the armies they're attached to), or used for a unique event.  These cards add the fun and requisite quotes from the movie (IT'S A TRAP!!!) and a lot of flavor.

The game is made by two things:

First, the asymmetric starting and winning conditions.  This really makes each faction feel completely different.  The Rebels are trying to kill the Emperor, the Empire is trying to protect the Emperor and kill the Rebel scum, and the Hutts are trying to control key economic locations.  This makes the Empire and Rebels natural enemies, while the weaker-starting Hutts profit while everyone's looking elsewhere--thematic!

Second, the usual "take a card if you took a country" rule is expanded to "take a card for each faction you took a planet from".  This forces at least some aggression with both other factions and prevents a "gang up on the leader" situation from getting too much steam.

Anyway, a great game that I look forward to playing again.  Hope it gets re-released someday.

I have played this three times (one 2-player, one 3-player, one 5-player).  Every time the empire has a severe advantage and the Rebels have lost.  The Hutts have no achievable goals so just chose a side to help and tried to achieve their goal in the mean time.  Overall, this is my least favorite RISK game of all time.

Excellent implementation of Star Wars universe into Risk style game.  Especially impressed with the cards... the little flavour text that matches so well the actual funtion of the card... any fan of Star Wars will appreciate the little details.  The Death Star has a very powerful and strategically important role for the Empire, the different abilities of the Fighters/Bombers/Cap Ships are seamlessly implemented into the very simple Risk combat system.  Finally, the different victory conditions for each faction create an altogether original Risk experience that in my mind is the best of the Risk line of games.

A bit of a step up from the Clone Wars Edition, this removes the Order 66 time limit concept, in favor of differing objectives for each player. The board is a big improvement in terms of looks (although it's almost too busy) while the piece quality is once again top notch (great looking rancors) although I'm not sure why they used the chickeny scout walkers instead of the well known AT-AT's. Oh yea, and there is a death star, which serves to block sectors as well as to blow up entire planets, which removes them from play, as well as makes them impassable for the purposes of re-inforcement. Dig that Force meter (which makes attacks against the death star more or less powerful and increases the card draw amount for dark side or light side too) as well. Oh yea, and ship tokens are back too. The rules for the death star dont fit entirly well with some of the basic rules of the game, but I'm still continually surprised at how elastic the original Risk concept has proven with all of these themed editions.

[b]GREAT AMERITRASH RISK-CLONE.[/b]

Much better than it needed to be to sell, and the game experience is a notch higher than I expected. Feels like Star Wars, and turn-by-turn plays well, capturing the theme of Star Wars and at the same time bettering the source game. Suits 3 players much better than many more well-established boardgames - and that's an art.

[b]HAN SOLO:[/b]

1. Brilliant as a 3-player battle.
2. Filled with cut-throat melees.
3. Awesome board. The BEST Risk board there is.
4. Great, powerful, and thematic directive cards.
5. Nice bits.
6. Useful insert.
7. It's Star Wars - so the theme is powerful with this one.
8. Many tactical choices each and every turn.
9. Some strategic decision making.
10. You get to quote all the way through each game: "The Force is strong", "Don't tell me the odds!", "Apology excepted captain Needa," etc.

[b]JABBA THE HUTT:[/b]

1. It's Risk.
2. Another dicefest - aren't all the best games?
3. Not enough D8s included with the game.
4. It's cut-throat as hell. Expect some backstabbing. Shouting. Waving of arms, shaking of fists, gnashing of teeth.

RISK Mass Effect is a carbon copy of this, and far more available.

Probably the best version of RISK for 3 or 5 players; interesting asymmetrical goals, interesting card powers. A blast.

After two Hutt wins in a row in 3-player games, probably needs a nerf to Hutt in the 3-player version, to bring them more in line with the 5-player setup; or maybe just a more aggressively anti-Hutt initial placement strategy from both Empire and Rebel, not sure.

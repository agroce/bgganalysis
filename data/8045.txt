RATING: 7.8
Non avere fretta a prendere le città!
Può essere altamente strategico attendere che alcune città si muovono sullo status prima di puntare ad una tessera.
Accumulare soldi per un fine seconda decade e terza decade é utile.
Se si spende molto subito poi si rimane bloccati per il resto della decade a guardare gli altri.
Puntare molto sulle guerre é redditizio sia come soldi che come segnalini vittoria guerre! Per cui farsi un buon motore militare.
Ricordarsi delle carte tradimento! Prenderne almeno 1 o 2 ogni tanto può essere utile.

RATING: 7
This is a temporary rating based on 1 play with 6 players.
I really enjoyed the game - but it seemed chaotic at some points.  I think that was because of the 6 players - my understanding is that the game plays better with 4 or 5.
There seem to be many paths to victory, which is always good and it was brilliant to play a game where you could go "lets have another war!" and then cause massive uproar and chaos which might not affect you much at all.

I am sure there is a decent game in here. I just haven't got the time to persevere with it. I find it very contrived and without any natural flow or rhythm. Disappointing. Struggle of Empires is a similar weighted game but better

RATING: 8
Euro-wargame with several paths to victory, negotiation, and lots of screwage.

The game is played over 3 decades, with each player having one action per turn from four choices (purchase a tile, auction a tile, start a war, pass).  A decade ends once all of the event tiles are auctioned off (there are treachery tiles used to screw others, troop tiles for wars, city tiles for abilities + scoring, event tiles for abilities + scoring + pace of the game).

Wars are fought in order to: gain money as a condotierre, win valuable laurels for scoring (the accumulation of laurels leads to HUGE point increases), and to manipulate the status of the city, which  directly corresponds to the point value of the city tiles at the end of the game.

Money and influence are the currencies of the game and they both have different uses, and both are EXTREMELY tight in gameplay.  There are also point bonuses at the end of the game for most money, and most influence.  All aspects of the game can be negotiated (which of course, are not binding) using money and/or influence.  It can be somewhat difficult to determine who is leading at any given point, which can sometimes lead to accidental kingmaking issues.  There is also the random aspect of the dice rolling during wars, but this can be mitigated to a degree through the use of troop tile and city tile modifiers.  

Overall, a very solid but dirty game, that probably works better with 4 or 5, rather than 3.

I find this to be a deceptively DEEP and DIFFICULT game in that it is very hard to accurately judge the value of tiles at different times during game play. The need to interact with opponents gives this a feel of Diplomacy, yet is much different at the same time.

As with most Martin Wallace titles, I find the game a struggle -- but am comforted in knowing that EVERYONE feels the same way. There are many options, and accurately assessing the value of those options and how much to bid for them is quite the trick.

Getting this to the table is a problem, as it's a much deeper game and the collection of players with the desire to work through this title is rare for me.

Excellent Play, but prone to AP players.  And VERY long.  This is a heavy bidding game. If you don't like bidding games you won't like this.  But it's very deep and very strategic.  I would give it more of a 4 to 4.5 rating for complexity, but only because you can trade coins/influence which makes strategic deal making super complicated if you really want to kill off the leading cities.

Early comments after one game: There are multiple roads to victory, multiple alliances and some cunning ways to screw your opponents. Very enjoyable, but the first game is a major learning exercise in what is possible. Subsequent plays have upgraded the rating. With the intrigue, back stabbing and dirty tricks the games gets even better!

NOTE: this is NOT a wargame! Yes, there are wars in it, but that is not the only way to victory, and the wars are played very abstractly.....and counter-intuitively: you are frequently in a situation where you DO NOT WANT to win a war! You can also win through the arts and abstract economics. This is a fantastic game that (very often) takes quite a while to play. The only other drawback to it is that while the bits are quite beautiful, the board is quite drab. A rather steep learning curve.

I want to like Martin Wallace's games, really I do.  However, there always seems to be something. With this one, there's an apparent multiplicity of strategic options, but one, the military, seems by some way the likeliest to win.  It's also a long game, and I don't think the depth of play is there to support that length. A shame because the core element of the wars, with condottieres for hire and cities' prestige rising and falling is an interesting one.

After first play...a very interesting game that manages to create a sense of intrigue and suspicion...using auctions of all things. Surprisingly, this game has become one of my favorite auction games, right up there with Medici and Goa.  Might even be my favorite Wallace game after Brass. 

Second play, with six players.  With six, as is often the case when there are six players, the game felt a bit out of control, not as satisfying.  By the time your turn comes around again, essentially all your options can be foreclosed, and/or your plans dashed.  Perhaps with that many players, the only way to make the game "work" is to constantly negotiate, in an effort to influence other players' plays.  Definitely not as compelling a game with 6.

Third play with 4, good game.

Too much auctioning, treachery cards may be too powerful -- especially "Bribe Troops."  Seems to consist of compartmentalized, unrelated turns, then suddenly at the end of the game a surprise winner emerges. IMHO, would doubtless benefit from my "Two Variants to Streamline Play."  Game begs to be simplified and tweaked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
i'm pretty sure i didn't get the full effect of this game, because it only became known on the last auction of the last turn that negotiation and currency exchange is allowed!  that sort of lets one evaluate it based on its core strength though, and i don't think it has a lot.  the battle stuff is a bit kludgy, the variable powers are really underwhelming, and i don't see any ultimate value in separating into 2 types of currencies.  a lot came down to the end auction in our first game too - big swings with a last battle and the -2 artist.  i'd probably give it a twirl sometime to try to incorporate more wheeling and dealing, but i think the underlying game isn't really special.  leaving rating at 0 until a replay because of how much i expect negotiation to change things.

I want to like this more than I do so far.  It's eluding understanding, even after ~6 games.  It's only rarely clear to me what I can do to help my position... given the uncertainty of how auctions will pan out, the result of calling one seems routinely not what I expected or wanted.

This one is tricky to rate after one play because we weren't aware that battles accrued victory points as much as they do. (3 VP chips give 3+2+1=6 VP)  In hindsight knowing that would have changed our strategy.  I still think this game will get better after a few plays..

RATING: 7
This is the typical Wallace game: it is strongly tied to historic background, it has ingenious mechanics with a bit of fiddlyness...
The single problem with this game lies in its "everything-is-auctioned-ness". If every player knows how to value auctioned tiles, everything flows well and is balanced. If any player fails the evaluation, everything can fall apart.
Nevertheless, I can see the potential for a great and tense game, and I personally love the idea (à la Imperial) of players not being directly involved in any of the major cities.
The production of the game is typical Treefrog: sturdy and durable, but with no concession to beauty...

RATING: 7
Princes of the Renaissance is a Euro/wargame/stockmarket game that has random elements that I normally dislike in gaming, but for some reason I happen to absolutely love this game.  Normally I despise dice based combat and drawing random cards.  Perhaps the multiple auctions, troop purchases, negotiations and treachery keeps me satisfied enough to actually tolerate the randomness.  In most cases you want to align yourself with one or more players.  PoR is defintely not multi-player solitaire.  There are multiple paths to victory, none of which are boring, all of which are Awesome!

Since there are so many ways to win, I often fall into the trap of trying out alternative ways of winning.  Sometimes players (myself included) forget that the game is all about being a Condottieri!  Keep in mind that alternative approaches (such as a heavy Merchant strategy) are more dependant on the other players' actions than if you simply participate in a lot of wars.  
  
Update:  The main downside to Princes of the Renaissance is that players really need to pay attention during every single auction.  Otherwise it gets annoying when players do not pay attention to the amount of the last bid and/or forget who has already passed.  

2nd Update: Unfortunately PotR does not allow a player to zone out due to all of the auctions.  If players pay attention it works.  If players are distracted the fun factor plummets.
 
Since this game is out-of-print, I have created my own copy of Princes of the Renaissance.  My version takes place in the present time Middle East.  I'm still interested in obtaining an original copy.

Finally I own this game due to a reprint.  Unfortunately, my game group will probably not one to play this one again...  

4 players, 5 plays!
5 players, 11 plays!
6 players, 9 plays!

Thought process:  "I know, I'll waste my influence in order to get paid to fight in a war, which I will intentionally lose in order for my adversary to gain power, thus gaining myself a boat-load of points."

There aren't many war games out there where losing can gain you more than winning.

My favorite be devious and gotcha game.  This game is fantastic.  After one play and coming in last place I immediately wanted to play this again.  My favorite Euro game is El Grande.  My favorite game designer is Martin Wallace and PoTR is another example of of gaming mechanics that are strokes of genius.  I recommend that you try it.

RATING: 8.5
A city influence game with a heavy dose of auctioning. Set in Italy around the time of the Italian city-states with all of the storied elements of influence peddling, double dealing and backstabbing. The currencies of the game involve "gold" and "influence" which must be managed to build armies and contest for the favor of Popes and other influential individuals and families.

Players invest in one or more of six great cities and then try to influence where the cities' status ratings will be by game end. These investments generally involve gaining the favour of famous figures within several influential families associated with the major cities. The favour of these notables also confer bonuses to one's income (in terms of either gold or influence which is refreshed at the start of each turn). This game has surprising depth that takes more than just a few playings to begin to uncover.
 
Like many of Martin's games, there are a myriad of tiles to consider for their advantages in game play. Some are purchased while others are bid for. Combat also involves bidding as players vie to be "condottiers" attacking or defending the major cities, the results of which determine whether a city's status is raised or lowered. The good news for the participants (and why the bidding can be vigorous) is that win or lose they will get paid. And, depending on player's investments in these cities, as a combatant, you may be deliberately playing to lose as the value of your "stock" in one city may rise relative to other player's investments in the city you are conspiring to torpedo. Hence the "Machiavellian" theme is brilliantly realized in all of the game's elements. 

Another excellent game from Martin Wallace but one which didn't get the attention I think it deserved. Long out of print, I count myself lucky to have found a copy.

RATING: 4
Theme ties to mechanics quite well in this game, but I see flaws ...

Game system requires players to all know what they are doing, who is leading and do things to stop it, otherwise the game just comes down to who collects wreaths, on a crazy rich get richer cycle as fighting combats gets you more cash ... defense seems weaker than offensive unless you have the right boosters.

Family with discount on condottiere is vastly superior to the rest (followed by family with boost to artillery), and resources are so tight the auctions aren't  that interesting. Either get bid up too high and you have one thing you can do, or hope the others spend theirs then you can get stuff before the round ends.

I think it better with more rather than less players, but with 5 I'd much rather play Struggle of Empires - no desire to own this one.

I think I like Perikles better although PotR is cleaner/simpler. PotR has players managing two currencies (cash and influence) to bid/buy tiles (city shares, armies, treacheries, events) and bid to fight wars for "their" cities. Cities have a set number of "shares" each with its own special power. 

I liked it and would like to play it again but I'm not sure if it'll ever be a "love to play" game. The auctions and money management are harder than Perikles but Perikles has more negative interaction which I like. Probably want to have both in my collection.

One play - thoroughly enjoyed it, despite coming in last.  Uses auction to "self balance" the many paths to victory, but fails to some extent - I was seat 4 of 5 and definitely noticed my disadvantage at not getting cavalry.  Overall, though, lots to think about, and a great experience.

Juego de wallace, en el que absolutamente todo se juega por subastas. Hay solo tres rondas o épocas.. y cada ronda finaliza en el momento que se adjudican cuatro losetas de eventos. También hay losetas de guerreros , para poder militar y losetas de ciudad, que otorgan beneficios varios, pero el principal, es que al final de la partida, las ciudades tendrán un valor que se multiplicará por el número de losetas de dicha ciudad que tengas.
La gracia está en los combates, en las que los jugadores subastan por apoyar al atacante y al defensor. El resultado variará el valor de la ciudad y por tanto, también de las losetas de ciudad finales. Además, quien gana un combate, gana una ficha de victoria, que se suman al estilo Fibonacci al final de la partida... con lo que te puede resultar interesante apoyar al enemigo aún cuando tienes losetas de la ciudad atacada.
Es interesante. Para jugones. Lo de pujar por los combates puede resultar algo confuso.

Incomparable - probably the best multiplayer ever designed. I love the mechanics and how they fit the theme, I love the presentation, I love the backstabbing aspect that smoothly fits and complements the overall design without taking away from it. Probably the only game where you can bid to fight on one side of a battle with the intention of losing it. Thank you Martin Wallace!

PotR is a difficult game to rate, as the experience can vary from great to poor depending on the playgroup. When introducing the game to different people I have met both utter failure and great success. In my usual gaming club, however, this game is a blast. I really dig watching players scheme and try to come up with all sorts of deals, from brilliant and imaginative pacts to downright blackmail. For us, the game is all about people and negotiation. All this, of course, means that our games usually last 4+ hours.

RATING: 6
A top Martin Wallace game. Heavy game with lots going on. Lots of thinking to play different sides. Love that you can take totally different approaches: build up a huge army & win laurels vs building merchants & no armies and buying city tiles. Looking forward to future plays.

Like the Machiavellian variant. It balances better the different family powers and it gets lots of treachery tiles out. Have also tried playing without family characters and it was fine.

The only downside is the lengthy play: 3.5 hours for our first 5 player game.

Edit: finally won after my fourth game. Used the merchant strategy to beat out a tough opponent who had 7 laurels and 5 tiles to my 1 laurel and 5 tiles (2 red merchants and 2 yellow merchants + 1 other).

After repeated plays, it is a decidedly 'dirty' game. Lots of bickering, backstabbing; usually results in bruised feelings.

Update from Feb 2009 to July 2013. Dropped rating from 8 to 6. The game is fundamentally unbalanced. The family powers are unbalanced. And the army availability due to turn order absolutely makes things unbalanced. The guy with the best army gets the most laurels win 80% of the time. The Merchant strategy has a 20%. There's no 3rd alternative.

A must-have for strategy fans: its well balanced structure and fast paced gameplay are the most brilliant aspects of this game. The three-decade structure of the games tends to valorize last-minute strategies, but globally the game is really well designed. Really good: don't let the awful graphic design of the game distract you and try this sweet board game. Expect about 3 hours of play for a game.

Played once. Did okay given I didn't know the rules nor the strategy when we started. The number crunching involved to optimize the endgame was pretty chaotic. Hard to get my head around exactly what the best end move is. All in all a fun game, but not one I need to own.

There was no initial seed of investment in this "stock" game, and that makes the first round very uncertain.  It seems whomever decides to invest first, would then be targeted.  I really didnt enjoy this game all too much, it could use a better theme, and a more interesting vested start to the game.  +1 point for the ability to be the pope.

I do like this a lot.  What fun to take over the defence of a city and fail and ditto the attack - the scope left by the rules for these types of Machiavellian moves is a big part of the attraction - there's real depth and subtlety here.  The different paths to victory take some exploring and there's a lot to get your head around - which is all good for a gamers' game like this.  Quite superb once you're up to speed with the rules.

(Warfrog edition) Perfect mix of theme and mechanics. The design fits the subject very well. Good quality components (bar a few minor printing errors). There is very little downtime as the game is really a series of auctions with the occasional war and you can speed up the end of each decade once you have run out of gold or influence. Wage wars but never lose your army! Lots to this game despite the short rules. Perhaps the only thing I don't like about the game is that as most of the scoring information is open, the winner may be decided by kingmaking which feels rather unsatisfying and and can slow the pace down towards the end if you have someone who insists on calculating everyone's scores before the game is over. Best with 5 or 6 non-AP players.

(Mercury Games edition) Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the reprint. A lot of thought has gone into tightening up the rules and improving the balance of play. The artwork on the box lid still looks like a generic eurogame from the nineties but the board is much nicer. The variant tiles are also well thought out, adding replayability and really should have been included as part of the base game not as an exclusive backer reward but that's Kick$tarter for you! The other rewards are fairly inconsequential but why reprint a game and purposely not improve on it?

This is one of those games that I think should have come with player aids of some sort.  Some of the tiles are vague, order of resolution isn't always clear, and it's sometimes not clear whether tiles' special effects affect other tiles.  Having said that, the game is engrossing and lends itself to a number of different strategies.  I like the use of two different types of currency (money and influence); figuring out how to manage or convert them can be a challenge in itself.

I don't know what it is about Wallace, but anything he's done without Bohrer has felt like bloated nonsense - albeit on the verge of genius. While there is a lot to love about this game: speculation where share values are driven by player performance in discrete events the participants of which are determined by auction and whose abilities are determined by prior auctions; the fact that compensation is awarded regardless of performance; the crazy hybrid of shares, negotiation, and war game. But I couldn't help but feel that the values clustered too much in the mid-game and are driven too chaotically toward the end of the game thus rendering the middle game a bit meaningless. Also, the multiplicity of other 'paths' to victory muddy the speculative nature of the game. I'll play it again, but it was not quite the thing for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Not bad, certainly not terrible, fragile across player groups and players of unequal skill, not particularly charming, but still a workmanlike game.

(Later)  PoR isn't a bad game.  With the right group it could even be a great game.  I merely doubt that such a group would ever include me.  I don't think I have the patience or interest to breed, build and train a group that would make PoR shine.

[Even Later]Far more interesting in concept than fact.  In fact, rather uninteresting in fact.

The random factors are gross and entirely unjustified.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initial playings very favorable.  There seems to be a learning curve, but I could see this being lots of fun with the regular group.  Bidding, backstabbing, multiple paths to victory, what's not to like?  The rules take a little while to digest.

Rules Errors: Played that the -2 French Invasion event tile stays on the city in a similar fashion as an artist.  This is incorrect, it is played, then removed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression: I liked it a lot, and this despite the handicap of playing 3-player, which is generally considered the weakest player count by far. Actually proved to be more straightforward than I was expecting vis-a-vis rules complexity, but managed to throw up some interesting decision points particularly when it comes to bidding influence to get involved in wars. I am admittedly a sucker for auctions in games and a fan of Euro-wargame hybrids, so I was probably pre-disposed to enjoy this one. Not the most strategic of games, and it holds out the possibility of getting skunked by an unlucky die roll, but the game does an excellent job of forcing you into a mercenary and Machiavellian mindset, which is altogether appropriate given the theme. A great title for a table full of schemers.

I really like this game.  It has many mechanics that seem very unique.  Including how you push cities up and down the city status by bidding and winning (or losing) wars.  Also, there are lots of auctions in the game.  The game is unique enough that I'm not even going to try doing a review.  I will however say that it's an amazing game limited only by your potential to take advantage of all the different options.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
What a fantastic mish-mash of moving parts! It makes my head hurt. There are so many viable strategic approaches that its sometimes hard to ken what your opponents are up to. Choosing a tile for auction is much more powerful than at first glance. The simplistic approach is to only choose the tiles you want to buy, but there is more to it than that...when you can pressure people to ally with cities that you want them to. 

The fact that influence and money can freely exchange hands for all sorts of extra-game dealmaking just ratchets this game off the scale. I haven't had the chance yet, but I'd really like to play PotR with 5 or 6 players that had a good grasp of the tiles and rudimentary strategy and see how convoluted the game could get. Martin Wallace seems to hit my sweet spot, more often than not.

Update: This one is a 10.  I can't find enough opportunities to play this masterpiece. This is a game that could really do with a reprint.

RATING: 5
My first Wallace game, and intriguing to say the least. The theme marriage to the game mechanics on this title alone is impressive, and rare for a Euro style game. Plenty of auctions, a smattering of ugly combats, and treachery galore in this title. Different paths are available to victory, and the ride is fun regardless of which one you choose. I love the constantly shifting alliances and subterfuge that permeate the entire game, few can bring it out like this title does. Recommended for anyone who has the time to hit this a few times so as to gain an appreciation for the differences in strategy and to gain more familiarity with the system, and who is also looking for something with confrontation which isn't as random as many of the American style games are. This is not a war game by any stretch, just very nasty in comparison to many Euros. As I play it more, I do admit that I'm slightly concerned that the system could be fragile (i.e.: bad play can wreck the system) as the non-offensive military players *must* try to hurry the game along as there aren't enough defensive units and bonus tiles to match the offensive ones. This is in flavour for the period, but it means that a long decade or two can end up swaying things strongly in favour of the military player. Conversely, if players hypothetically decide to go with a non-military quick round end strategy, they could end the game before it got started. The sweet spot for this is in-between, when everyone understands the way that each strategy is supposed to unfold and plays to their own strengths while keeping the others at bay.

I do have to say that the game feels too restrictive on a lot of levels though, and in need of some minor fixes. The family with the condottiere discount is much too good and IMO should be removed as an option. I also think there aren't enough resources in the game to make the auctions interesting, which isn't a good thing since there are so many auctions!

Side note: this feels related to Struggle in some sense because of the chits which confer special powers. Princes is more convoluted because of the nature of victory points (almost free choice of what cities to invest in, no troops "on the board") but it is also a much more fragile game. I prefer Struggle but still think there are some unique things going on in Princes, primarily in the form of the "evil game feel" which is because of all the under-handedness that the system encourages. This title really makes me wish Wallace games were picked up by bigger firms though, with some more playtesting / tweaking I think Princes could have been an all-time classic. The underlying concept here is solid gold, the implementation is in need of work though.

RATING: 7
Typically crap Warfrog production and nightmare logic rules presentation keep this Wallace masterpiece from a higher rating...this is an outstanding game that plays out much better than I thought it would given its auction-heavy mechanics and almost overwhelming decision matrix.    The war system is unique and really brings out the mercenary theme...there's much to consider in choosing fights and sometimes motives are suprisingly subtle and underhanded.  There's definitely some elements of Dune here (which is a great thing).  Even with negotiation and careful play there's no reason this game can't clock in at under 120 minutes unless you're playing with the ex-ASL'ers, and that is a completely solid 120 minutes of outstanding gameplay.

Father figure to Struggle of Empires and Perikles. The cash flow is more natural in SoE than in PotR, but PotR is more brutal about it.

Wow, after one game I can see this as a long term winner.  After two games, I can totally recommend this.  You have so many choices.  You can try your own strategy and no one can really tell you that it won't work... well they may try, but really what do they know?  I like this game so much that I went out and bought Struggle of Empires, just because it was highly rated Martin Wallace game... probably my least researched game pick up.

This was a lot of fun, though the horrible rulebook caused far too much confusion in the first couple of rounds. As with most first plays, I wish I had better understood the paths to victory early in the game--my lack of military might led to a lack of city tiles, which lead to a narrow loss. 

Next time I play this, I look forward to more active table talk and trading of the various currencies AND favors!

Played again, for the first time in five years, and like it more now. Genre of game like Chicago Express where you cannot make progress on your own: it's too easy for others to knock you down. You need to focus on setting things up so others act in your interest because it's also in their interest.

Very different from Chicago Express as an explicit negotiation game and because of the medium (more low medium) luck element.

Players are families in medieval Italy, and are attempting to acrue the most victory points at the end of the game.  Points are scored in a myriad of ways, but the majority come from buying "shares" in one of five Italian cities.  The value of the share will fluctucate during the game, a reflection of the city status.  Status can rise and fall via patronage of artists, winning or losing wars, etc.  The fundamental mechanics are basically auction related, using two currencies at different times (gold, or political influence).  It sounds complex, but really isn't.  I suspect victory may come down to one or two battles late on the last turn, but need to play more.  A fun game and one of the strongest yet from Warfrog.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
There are several reasons I love this game. 
1 Mix of flavour and mechanism. Everything in the game as a meaning in real life yet all is tied in in a couple of easy to understand mechanisms. 
2 Force of choice, You can do anything but you can only do one thing in your turn, better make it count...
3 Heterostrategic, there are various distinct but not prescribed ways to victory wich gives you a lot to explore (compare Puerto rico).
4 Commitment, you have to commit to one goal or perish. A jack of all trades will be the master of none.

This game has everything a gamer could want. The evilness of being able to decalre war between any two cities alone makes this game brilliant.

To me the best game of 2003.

PoR might be one of the greatest diplomatic/empire games. Despite the awful presentation, poor rules, lack of examples, and vague timing of effects I endorse this one. Good design shines through the truly terrible production values from WarFrog.
 
However Struggle of Empires covers most of this game's strong points and adds a great influence game in the same time frame, so PotR is a victem to it's younger brother.

Princes of the Renaissance is an another Martin Wallace game which I enjoy quite alot along with Liberté and Age of Steam. I am happy with my game purchase.

I am not into wargames much. I don't really have an interest for them in general. Princes of the Renaissance is an exception to the rule, though it is not one of your typical wargame either.

I am very happy that some of my geekbuddies made the sugguestion of trying out this game. It was a nice surprise. I had mix reviews at first.

The theme is interesting and the components are very nice. There are differeent possibilities and choice you can do in this game.

Although one of the families might have a better edge in the game. The family which let you pay one less influence. I think that family has better odds of winning the game overall.

I do have some concerns that the game is/may often be decided by the last war (die roll)

RATING: 6
This is a stock market game in which wars are used to affect stock values.  I like the idea of deliberately losing fights to advance one's interests -- it captures the Machiavelllian theme well.  With some groups, this can really drag, which prevents it from rating higher than a 6.  1-2

A Eurogame very rich in theme. A lot of things for players to think about. Only problem is that players need to be aware of the imbalances in player powers for the game to really work.

RATING: 9.5
Mad, fiddly fun from Martin Wallace.  This is the sort of highly distinctive, personally idiosyncratic design that puts him on a rung above the German mathematicians.  It isn't elegant, but it delivers brutal choices and intrigue in spades. 

The game is surprisingly easy to learn, at least in terms of how to play.  In terms of what to do, it's well-nigh impossible to get on your first play, as a sea of tiles and complex scoring mechanisms overwhelm you.

What didn't I like?  Well, I'm not a fan of open auctions, and this game is pretty much all open auctions.  Also, it has a lot of scribbly little tiles with small properties that have to be constantly remembered to be enacted.  Not sure about the balance - in my one play with five, the top two scorers were the two biggest offensive military powers.  But I had a lot of ideas after the game about how I could have better countered them.  I had a lot of ideas period, which is great.

The game feels like a pastiche of other, later games.  The auctions work a lot like the best part of Goa, where the auction order of tiles is determined solely by the players, creating a nest of money and influence management possibilities.  It doesn't have Goa's unthematic but mechanically impressive money-swapping, but the rest of the attached game is far more absorbing than Goa.  The city-stock-investment works just as a simplified version of Imperial, but it somehow _feels_ more dynamic because the cities rise and fall, even if they just end up in a racehorse order in the end. 

Perhaps the best thing about the game is how organically it creates heavy negotiation.  You don't have to beg and backstab for the game to work, but you will want to anyway.  I'm normally a pretty quick player and our group is not exactly a cabal of grifters, but I found myself in a late-game 10-minute turn, unsuccessfully trying to convince the family in control of the Pope to join my side in battle, as my fortunes slowly ebbed away into the Italian dust and the other Condottieres smirked.

Ignore those who say the game is too long.  If you can't play games longer than 90 minutes than what are you looking at this game for anyway?  I can't think of a game that is less deserving of the tag 'too long for what it is'.  This game is packed with intrigue and fits into a weeknight game session length.  Also, the components are just fine.  The small board makes sense, because you need space for all the tiles in front of each player.

Basically, it is a stock/investment game with a topsy-turvy war mechanic that tweaks the stocks, some crazy card play, and fun screwage.  The stocks have special powers though in this game.  Third decade event tiles can really create some intense auctions (reminding me of step three auctions in Power Grid).  As the game evolves, the intrigue and diplomacy among the players really increases and alliances come into play.  A nice balance of long-term strategy and tactical play.  Reminds me of Imperial but it shares few mechanisms with Imperial.  Scoring offers many different paths to victory.  A brilliant, one-of-kind game.  One of Wallace's best.

* Played 5+ times. I wish I could say I am a big fan -- but I'm not. I like all kinds of games, but this one just lacked any excitement for me.

PotR doesn't quite entice me as Perikles does, but it's still a great game.  The loose alliances which form and dissolve from turn to turn is pretty cool.  You're often forced to align with players with whom you are competing only to save a common interest.  I'm intrigued and will play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I have a single major complaint about this game: the auction mechanism becomes dull and repetitive over the course of the game, no matter how many entertaining wars are fought. It's a big fly in the ointment of an interesting game. Another, less annoying but nonetheless significant problem is the method of ending the decade - by auctioning off all four event tiles. The extremes that are possible with that method are game-wrecking. If one player has the mind to, he can choose the event tiles four turns in a row, ending the whole game in twelve turns. Or no one picks them and the game drags on. Too bad, the theme is interesting, and the condottieri auction is a blast. *** UPDATE: No change in my opinion of the game. If you can withstand the nonstop bidding, then the appeal of PotR is unquestionable. it has many interesting paths to victory and several strategies to pursue. However, I wish that there had been an extra mechanism or two to bring some respite from or to break up the monotony of the bidding. The simple die-rolling for combat isn't enough. I'd probably play PotR if asked, but would prefer many other games of its weight and length.

RATING: 9
After two games I now feel there is a better game in there than I initially thought (initially I rated it an 8).  I am no longer so convinced that the balance falls in favour of the strongest armies, as the winner was by no means militarily the strongest and the second place had a rather weak army (and chose her moment to push the game to a finish, when she was in a strong position to win).

This is a many-faceted game and deserves the good reviews and ratings it gets; however there is at least one person in our group who dislikes it.  I think his dislike is mainly due to the difficulty in following the change in the value of both currencies and the city status.

Really fun theme. Only play with the Machiavellian variant. Extremely difficult to explain to new players. They won't get at least one thing and will be crushed in their first game because of it and discouraged from playing again. Horrible rulebook, read everything on BGG before playing.

However, you should play again! The interaction in this game is intensely fun.

A brilliant game with various strategies available to reach victory conditions.  At first it seems overwhelming, as 1 and 1 don't seem to add up, but after a few plays things start falling in place and you can see the abilities to manipulate the flow of the game.  Tight, tense, wonderful.

UPDATE:  I want to play this more, lots more! Yet I can't find anymore than one other player with any real interest to get this to the table and work out the game's depth.  I believe this could easily become my favorite of all games - if ever given that chance.

Home-made Copy with Variant tiles, All components are an improvement over the original - errors on the board and cards are fixed and the text is bigger, bolder and easier to read.

Awesome game.  My favorite bidding / market manipulation game.  The link-to-theme is really quite good.  I like using Jimzik's variant tiles so much that I made up game-matching graphics for them.  Check out the game page to download, print and paste.  It really improves the game.

The session report of my first play and first inpression can be found here:

http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/36496

I wish I had the opportunity to play it more, but because it is a pure bidding game, it takes experience to know how to value things.  Because it is a longer game (2-3 hours), fairly obscure and somewhat complex, there are fewer players out there that know it well enough to make a good game of it.  Perhaps I should be bolder in bringing it to the table with our "non-gamer" friends: the seem to take to just about everthing else, why not this?

This game was fabulous!  Just from reading the rules, I knew I would love it.  I can't imagine this game having a particular strategy that is better.  There are a multitude of winning strategies, and much is dictated by what the rest of the group is doing.  I find the gameplay intuitive and engaging, with little downtime, as everyone is usually involved in auctions.  The mechanics of wars is also fantastic!  

If I have one minor quibble, it's that everyone can see how much influence and money you have left when you get change after winning an auction.  Why not just hide it behind a screen?

Played a second time, years after the first go around, with five players.  Still a great game.  Even better than I remember it being, actually.  This game played a lot longer because we bought more troops and treachery tiles instead of event tiles for the first two decades.  I got run over, but managed to get in on quite a few wars (winning only 1 out of 6 if I remember correctly).  Going first and getting good troop tiles didn't help in our game, though I thought that would be the obvious move.  

So many paths to victory here.  Love it.

I'm slowly becoming a fan of Martin Wallace and Princes of the Renaissance does not hurt this progress at all. Basicly full of different auctions, but it manages to capture the feel of intrigue-filled Italy quite perfectly. Quite often you end up doing rather surprising things, just because it helps your goals, even though it seems like folly on a short-term. One slow person can lenghten the game considerably, unfortunately.

Highly engaging game of stock market speculation, negotiation, bribery, deal-making, extortion, warfare, and money management for the game's ever-present auctions...all fueled by underhanded scheming. This description sounds horribly clunky and overwrought, but actually, the game is a marvel of lean, minimal design. In fact, except for the Early Railways, PoR could be Wallace's cleanest design. A magnificent game that could eventually rank among my favorites. Oh, and it's a blast to play.

Totally homemade, using BoardoftheLoom's redesign.

Can't rate this yet, but I would say that 3 is definitely not a great number for this game.  There just isn't much at stake in the wars and there isn't really any competition for pieces.
Update:
Played again, many years later. This time there were five of us, but the rules explanation was less than stellar and we got some things wrong. Also, as a group we did an amazing job of over-appreciating the value of things in the first decade. Even with this foibles though, you could see how interesting the game was at it progressed. It's an evil game, and understanding the war aspect is a bit of a challenge, but I I enjoyed it. I'm just not sure when this will make it to the table again.
As for the new production, it's definitely better. My only thing is that they could have made the ranking of city markers and the city track larger.

Was really excited about this game after reading the reviews.  Now, after playing it a couple of times, and thinking about it more, I realize that I don't especially want to play any more.  I don't mind it being all auctions, but I'm not fond of games that are all auctions and require such a solid long-range plan going into even the first one.  The game is very unforgiving of indecision.  And in the end, I don't feel like I've done much of anything by the end of the game.

I do love this game, it is a wonderful blend of bidding systems, tactical skills, and treachery, and you have several ways to win. You can fight, you can avoid wars and try to build an economical system that allows you to bid for the better tiles or play merchants, you have to find some good and profitable alliances and you will find out which other players are the rivals to fight, and you must figure out all these things while you are playing. This is a complex and subtle game and this is probably the reason why it is not in a better position in the rank. Anyway, in my humble opinion this is one of the best Martin Wallace´s games, and his biggest underdog.

Components: good components overall, blue and purple could be more different, and which is the city of each family could help
Complex: easy to learn, several plays to understand what is going on
Weight: medium
Players: 5 or 6
Length: around 2 hours, probably could go longer
Mechanics: bidding, almost everything is about bidding
Decisions: many, which city tile to buy, which cities will make the war, should I support any of them
Opinion: with easy mechanics you have a game with lot of interaction and lot of things going on.
You are a Condottiero in the Italian Renaissance, and you pursue your own goals, yes, there are five cities, but you only look for yourself. Invest (buy) in the best cities, at least the ones you think will be the best ones, start wars against that city you like to see down, or that other one you do not care about.
All game is about bidding, with two different currencies (money and influence), you have to think where to bid and when to bid, obviously how much.
In the end you will have VP's for the City tiles (a kind of shares on them), for winning battles, for having money, influence and for several tiles giving VP's by themselves.
Oh, I forgot you have cards that can be very harmful to other players, probably not very powerful when you enter the game, but when you know what it is about, they can be played at the right time and really harm your opponents.
In a nutshell, really lovely game with lot of interaction and easy mechanics, you only look for your family although there are some cities out there... but think you will have to bid almost all the time

RATING: 8
Recommended for those looking for something that incorporates both the elegance and compactness of Euro-style games and the flavor and complexity more often found in the North American designs.  Expect some difficulty the first time through; the sheer number of options is intimidating, and it's difficult to know what to do or how much to bid.  It's the sort of game that is much more satisfying once everyone has played a time or two.  Playing Struggle of Empires a couple times has increased my appreciation of Princes of the Renaissance. Both games do some similar things, but Princes does it in a subtler, more interesting way, allows more strategic paths, and plays in less time. I don't like it as much as I liked Age of Steam and Liberte, but it's solid.  My only niggling worry is that the condotierre-bidding family seems to have a significant edge on everyone else, and I currently prefer to leave that family out of the game.

Nine plays. A sprawling game of skulduggery and manipulation. There's a lot going on, perhaps so much so that it sometimes feels like things are slightly out of control, but I find it fun anyway. The one major flaw is that a player who gets multiple condotierre discounts has a huge advantage, and in this respect the Baglioni family has a leg up from the get-go. Playing without the starting family powers is essential, I think.

As per usual Martin's game include some interesting mechanics.  Unfortunately, it was unclear to me how to achieve victory as I seemed to always be short on funds, even though a lot of the bids went to the first bidder (no one appeared to have money).

Not sure what to think of this one. On the downside, it's long and full of questionably useful special powers. On the upside, the auctions are pretty good and the wars certainly keep things lively. The theme of conniving and court intrigue is definitely well represented, making this a remarkably vicious game. And we didn't even play with any negotiation or diplomacy!  I can't tell if throwing in negotiation would actually help or not--negotiation can really make a game shine but it nearly always slows things down, and this is a 3+ hour game to begin with. I imagine a group that really dedicates itself to this game (multiple playings, close together) would find a great deal of depth and subtlety in Princes of the Renaissance. For now, this gets a 6 but I can imagine the rating going up in just the right circumstances.

Why DID I wait so long to play this- beyond the facts that it is OOP, tres expensive, and hard to get a hold of a copy?

Princes of the Renaissance is a brilliant Wallace game, with lots of interaction and opportunities for negotiation, screwage and backstabbing, and a really well-realized theme.

Players raise armies, utilize influence and money to profit, and increase their family's power in Renaissance Italy. Players politic for inter-City wars to raise or lower the relative power of cities (and increase or decrease relative VP's from influence in those cities).

The game plays quickly enough, and the players have control over when the Event tiles of a Decade are auctioned, and so how fast the turns pass.

Three short years, and then players count the carnage and revel in their power.

Princes of the Renaissance is a fantastic game, worthy of the acclaim, and of the generally high price tags attached. I have several Wallace games, and enjoy them all, but I really loved this one at first sight.

Something of a single strategy game in that it's much easier to win with a large army than without. The city tiles seem very unimaginative, with lots of identical ones and uninspiring special powers, while the clumsy graphic design looks as though it were done by a ten year old. More development might have made this a classic, as it is it's just so so.

An auction game that isn't.  This is another tightly constructed game from Martin Wallace where you are trying to excel at several things at once and you are always 1 point short of being able to follow the perfect course to victory.

You don't get much for your money in terms of game bits, but the game is tight, tense and full of decisions.  There are few moments of down time and every action by every player has a significance on your position.  It can all come down to a single auction or a single battle, or the treacherous intervention by your worst enemy.  As such, the game is worth every penny you spend to get a copy of it.

This game is starting to warm up to me.  Heavy game in my opinion, needs more thoughtful play.  This is a game that gets better with repeated plays to understand how all the mechanics fit together and how to optimize them to reach your goals.  Our group doesn't focus in on one game so whenever we play I feel I am just reacting.

I really enjoyed struggle of empires and this game has all the elements that I loved and is more euro style and less war like. Collecting tiles and mini combats, auctions and stabbing players in the back. A few more plays needed but despite an initial long game, this will play in about 2hours.
Superb Martin Wallacew fair.

RATING: 9
By the standards of German-style games, PotR is lengthy and fairly complex, but it is full of tense moments due to the bidding for tiles and the importance of the wars between the city states. So why don't I rate it as highly as Puerto Rico and El Grande? Firstly, because it is not as well balanced as those games; single events can significantly alter the relative status of the players, and random factors can play a major role in such events (the dice rolls in a war, one player picking up a certain Treachery Tile). Secondly, because the quality of the game components is not as high as the vast majority of German-style games, particularly the content and format of the rulebook.

War(eurowar that is):market manipulation:auctions:

initial rating 1 play 3 players

Excellent strategic Euro/Wargame cross that is very well themed and fun to play

With all those mechanics it's a gamer's game and a little long (2.5 to 3 hrs) but well worth it. Multiple paths and lots of options throughout topped off with just enough dirty play to really keep it tense. Along with great long term planning abilities you can also somewhat manipulate and shape the scope of the game if your crafty. Rewards repeat playings as you become familiar with the costs and abilities but it was quite good on first play through. Money is very tight here like in AOS but you won't be taking out shares so spend wisely, also influence is quite tight as well and very necessary for certain actions and purchases.

Not a true wargame but at least here war is always a viable option depending on the cities chosen and it is nice to have all the options available. War is mostly there for market manipulation of the city tiles and for scoring VP's but you also collect some much needed cash. The "pope" can really throw you for a loop here as two families can gang up on one and some of the treachery tiles can thwart you or help you here too so timing and choices are important concerning war.

The family with the condotierre discount might have a slight edge on the others in the beginning but there are 2 tiles in the game that can be auctioned off with the exact same power so just make sure the same guy does not get them and they come out early, it might also be helpful to limit that family to one discount per round but I'm not sure yet. Also the 'steal 2 influence' tile is just as good as this and causes a 4 point swing once per round so watch out for this too. I think component complaints are silly here as the board is fine even if a little small but it suffices nicely as do the rest of the bits.

Excellent interaction and replay value in this title as each game should play out a little differently. This would be much more interesting with 4 to 6 and quite different really so I can't wait to try it. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 8.5 => 9 (my only concern is balance and I'm not talking about starting families here)  Talk about a different game with 5 players rather than 3, holy Toledo!  Just an excellent negotiation game with considerable depth and subtleties, wars are quite tricky and can be very slippery slopes as there are a ton of things to consider and watch out for and they are not all easy to see/consider, also the carpet can and will get pulled from under you! THE METAGAME IS THE GAME! Sweeeeet :)

A little long with 5 but easy to see 4 or 5 will be best for this, I'm not sure yet if with 4 it will just be 2 against 2 and even if it happens it might not be bad anyway. NO DOWNTIME in this game another huge strength, everyone is involved or definitely interested in all the preceedings because you will be affected in some way. My favourite Wallace title because it combines high strategy and FUN, AOS and Brass close behind

RATING: 7.5
There is a lot of downtime in this game, especially when you are not involved in a war that is going on.  It can also feel like you have nothing to do on your turn if you're out of money or influence.  Still I think my rating could improve with subsequent plays.  There is a lot of subtlety to the game that would likely reveal itself with additional plays.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (November 2013)

This is a good gamer´s game, perhaps it can go up higher in my personal ratings. It has a lot of things I like, negotiation, bidding, shifting alliances and different areas of influence. It is (relatively) simple rules wise (although the rulebook is confusing in some parts), but it is very hard to play competitively, it has VERY interesting decisions (what to buy, what to auction even if you don´t want it, when to fight, etc.) and you have so few resources, each decision counts. The theme is awesome, and the game mechanics are in total agreement with the theme. You need a group with thick skin because there are many ways to attack and betray and it could lead to hurt feelings.  

The game´s components are ok, the game board is small with regular art, but it is very clear and functional. The playtime can be long for some people, but I don’t feel any downtime so I don’t care. 

Bottom line, a game I need to play again (and again), it has a satisfying depth and it is hard to play well. I would like to buy it. This is Martin Wallace at his best, nowadays he is mostly miss with me.

After more plays, I continue to love Princes of the Renaissance. Still there is some reticence from me to play it. It is a very taxing game. When we finish I’m drained (but satisfied). This is not necessarily a bad thing but I won’t play it very often due to this. 

I’m worried that it seems that the very first plays should be to buy the best military tiles available, then the game can really start. Having a huge disadvantage in the military aspect can be very hard to overcome. I hope this is not the case. 

Another issue is that the 3rd round is always very short because players (probably) know who is in the lead so the leaders auction the artist tiles very quickly. This has led to players that have lots of resources but without any VPs at the end. I’m not sure how I feel about this.

Still, I LOVE this game and I want to buy it.

1st, this game isn't for everyone, it needs a couple of fixes. I posted a variant here based off all the complaints I read here on the BGG. The 1st is very simple = Players may buy 1 Military Unit AND 1 Treachery Tile at the same time. The 2nd is an upgrading of the other 4 family tiles to bring them on par with Baglioni and d'Estes who were winning 90% of the games. If you put this little bit of change into the game it is a very challenging game.

RATING: 8
Played once in Essen, and this is the game I badly want to play again soon.  Fun and tense, even in the big halls of the fair.  Be careful for the few mistakes: the "Steal influence" tiles have a wrong English explanation (should read "steal 2 influence points from any player"), and the city starting status points are not listed in the rules (refer to the sticker on the plastic wrapper around the box).  There is one extra pawn to be discarded or used to identify the attacker in a war.  Great game, very close, several winning strategies, not much downtime, lots of interaction.
Since Essen, I played a couple of times, and the game is still as enjoyable as it was on day 1, even though the alternative strategies to victory are not as efficient as my initial attempt (to say the least :-)
Exchanged the game for Game Of Thrones with Vincent.
I still like this one, but not as much as before; downgrading to 8.

28.10.2009: I have yet to play a full game of this. It has a very steep learning curve that isn't helped by the printing errors on the components. However, I think it has potential and with some decent play aids to help with those first games I'm sure we'll figure it out eventually. Due to the learning curve, the next time will be better planned. I now also have some clue on how to present it to the players.

I've enjoyed my playing of this game so far though it is a hard game to teach to people. Understanding what other players are planning to do is important so that you can make the best of your turn when it comes around. The game combines auctions and combat into a system where uneasy alliances are formed. A clever game that should see more playing time in my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In 2003 and 2004, Wallace made two open-style auction games with asymmetrical player powers driven by tile selection - Struggle of Empires and Princes of the Renaissance. These games are bold designs, creatively conceived and expressed, social and interactive yet still highly strategic. They share some key features and yet play very differently. And they are both brilliant.

Princes of the Renaissance is definitely Machiavellian. Players take on the role of powerful princes who use the cities of Italy as their tools to gain money and influence. The Princes drive the city states to war with one another, then hire out their armies to those cities to fight those wars, getting paid win or lose. As the game progresses, players purchase city tiles that give them a stake in whether or not a city's status is high or low. It's basically a stock system, buying shares in the cities you expect to do well. Most city tiles confer other benefits as well and are the primary source of points at the end of the game - at least for the cities with highest status.

There are two forms of currency in the game, gold and influence. Both are scarce. Benefits that at first seem negligible, such a 1 discount on the auction price of an event tile, are actually quite powerful as having that 1 discount can be a major factor in winning an auction.

There appear to be many, many strategies that can be pursued here. Build a strong army and go for laurels? Collect city tiles and manipulate city status as you can? Buy a pile of merchants and out bid everyone with your wealth? Save your influence and money while trying to gain value from the exploits of more powerful players? Gold and influence can be exchanged freely in this game, which make for some great negotiation/bribe/blackmail options. The city tile/share system creates a complex web of temporary alliances and enemies.

In short, this is our kind of game. We had a blast.

RATING: 7
Solid game with some innovative mechanics that unfortunately has been overshadowed by several more recent Wallace designs that, unfortunately, are not that good.  The way the players can volunteer to lead the mercenary armies plus the fact that two types of currency, gold and prestige, are used for bidding, are among the more innovative features.  Unfortunately, this game has a variable play length -- it can drag on some times -- and doesn't get played nearly as often as it deserves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I think I prefer this to Struggle Of Empires - nice mix of strategy and tactics and not actually that complex.  The final 'decade' is by far the most important.  Perhaps a bit long at 3 hours but not oppressively.  A good game which I would happily play but not compelled to own it.  Treachery tiles are really nasty and too random for my tastes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Lots of different possible strategies, a lot going on to explore so it'll take a game or two to get a grasp: stock investment, military conflict, special powers, 2 different currencies that you have to try to generate. And it's got one of my favorite game "mechanisms," shifting alliances.
Reminds me a bit of Imperial in a good way.

Amazing to me how such a simplistic board can lead to such a  meaty game.  With all the 100s of games released every year, how can a game design of this brilliance remain OOP?  I could see GMT doing a nice P500 of this one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Maybe I missed something, but I don't know how Imperial got all the kudos for separating players from countries (innovative!) when Princes of the Renaissance did it better three years earlier.

This is the definitive "Powers Behind the Throne" game. There are six famous Italian city-states (Rome, Naples, Milan, Florence...) and six noble families residing in the countryside and pulling puppet strings from afar. Each player takes control of a family and patronizes the various city states with money and influence. Pause for a moment and consider that, in abstract terms, we're following the stock game model, where players are investors and cities are companies. Now reconsider the theme and observe the Wallace X-factor at work: players direct patronage toward notable individuals in each city, and those individuals each lend a unique advantage to that player for the remainder of the game. It's like making an investment that comes with a variable power, which means that player's positions in the game become increasingly asymmetrical. The last bit of genius that ties this all together is that players maintain their own private armies, may foster wars between any two of the city states, and may bid to fight for either side in a given war. The outcome of the war affects the standing of the city and thus the prestige of the locals receiving patronage. This is where the values of your investments go up and down.

Princes of the Renaissance is thematically immersive, mechanically intuitive, and overall quite easy to like. The core shape or idea at work here is top notch. It falls a little short in the particulars, however. There are a ton of tiles floating around in the game that players draft via patronage (artists, merchants, nobles, intrigues), and quite a few of these tiles are too restrained and colorless. Maybe it's because the game came out in 2003. Maybe it's because this was Wallace's bridge game leading out of the lean, no-frills affair that was Age of Steam. Whatever the reason, the variability that's just begging to come to life here is a little subdued. I enjoyed Princes of the Renaissance and think it could easily be a 9 or a 10 if it were redeveloped into the game I think it deserves to be. As it stands, it's still Wallace's best game after Brass.

Similar to e.g. Imperial, players buy into city states but act on their own behalf. They are Condottieres who build their own army and can support changing city states in Renaissance Italy. Fame is won by investing in city tiles, winning battles, but also by supporting artists, earning the most money or influence and a few other sources.

I prefer Wallace's economic games but Princes of the Renaissance is the one of his Warfrog conflict titles I like best. It helps that it has an important stockholding element. Seek the right alliances, bid wisely. As usual for Wallace, combat resolution is simple and a single D6 roll can have severe consequences. Fortunately, PoR offers other routes less dependent on Fortuna's goodwill. Although it's a long game, it doesn't feel so long as everybody is constantly involved.

For a Martin Wallace game, the rules are unexpectedly straightforward and fairly easy to learn.  However the strategies are less evident at first, mainly because it is difficult to evaluate the relative value of each tile.  Resource management is a huge issue, which I enjoy.  It seems like there are many different ways to win, and you have to become familiar with the system to learn how to combat certain strategies.  The dice do play a role, but their presence seems smaller than other Wallace games.  As my group becomes more familiar with this game, it seems like my enjoyment of this game will only increase.  It made a very strong first impression, though I feel I really need more experience to figure out how the mechanisms interlock and how the tiles affect each other.

IMO, much better with four to six players.  Another fabulous game by Martin Wallace, with lots of good choices and decisions, where auctions are the central aspect in acquiring most things (tiles, influence, gold).  It's a game that has tile building and majority influence to it, blended with some light wargame-styled elements.

Was lucky enough to play this one at BGG.con 2010.  Apparently its somewhat hard to find, so that'll probably be one of the few places I can get my hands on the game.

Auction game. Unintuitive at first (you'll need some time to become accustomed with some originalities in the mechanics).
Fast paced, strong player interaction, some luck, many decisions to take. 
Unfortunately the Family and Treachery tiles aren't too well balanced, and some of the City tiles are quite bland (nothing really spoiling the game, but it could have been developed a bit better).
Better with more players.

I lowered my rating after a second play.  The game is very tight, almost too restrictive.  This is, for me,frustrating to the point of lowering my enjoyment of it. It seems on the verge of a really great game but in the end, it falls somewhat short for me.

RATING: 6
A rich, tense, and complex bidding game with lots of interesting options, even after you run out of money.  However, my opition of it has gone down a bit with more plays because I always seem to be hosed by the questionable moves that others make that hurt there own position and also hurt my position in the process.  It can also be a little AP prone and become a bit tedious.  There are also family balance issues.

Based on 5 plays with 4, 5, and 6 players.

Wow, what a good game. I have heard people claim that Age of Steam is Martin Wallace's best game however I would put this one on top. 

For what is essentually an auction game with 2 types of currency it has a lot of tension. There are a number of choices to make and at least to me in my limited play, all seem viable.

There is way too much going on in this game, hard to wrap your head around it.  The treachery cards add alot of chaos.  Not sure how much influence you can have over scoring track as everyone else can sabotage the wars.  A few tiles are overpowered. The text on the components is too small to read. Money and influence are tight which makes for some tension in the bidding. You are only going to like this game if you like endless auctions.  I didn't like it very much.

Played once with 4 players - so my rating will change.  The post discussion after the game was incredible.  I managed to get a -2 to condottiere but lost the game... by a nose because I didn't manage to snag a cavalry tile.  We played with the rules of one troop type per player.  Is this perhaps an incorrect way to play. An offensive military strategy would seem much more lucrative than a defensive strategy... are cavalry perhaps too strong?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A good game that's probably losing a rating point from me just because Wallace has created a slew of other games that in my opinion have topped this design.  Players are adding influence to each city and what's unique about this game is the stock aspect.  If you're the only one in a city you're not going to get any help raising it's status value (VPs).  Another thing going for this design is the various strategies (money making, warmonger, etc.) available, although it seems having a good army is a more reliable strategy unless everybody decides to do the same.  There's a lot of auctioning in this game (for the tiles) and where battles are fought (one can try to influence the status of a city just by picking where the battles are at).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

One of my favourite Martin Wallace designs ( I like RRT and COTEII better). My advise? Buy low. Win wars. Never take the "fall guy" strategy. Don´t let being the pope bother you too much.

RATING: 7
A good game if you like auctions.  For a euro, decent theme.  One of Martin Wallace`s better designs from his earlier days.

Some concern about the importance of building a strong army focused on attacks and then going out to win laurels.  Not enough experience to judge if this would be a dominant strategy.

Some similarities to Perikles.

Another excellent Martin Wallace game where theme and mechanics dovetail seamlessly. Players take on the roles of Condotierre, using influence and money to become the premier family in Rennaissance Italy. The fun really starts when players start wars, fight on behalf of a city state (Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, Venice), try to lose the battle, pocket cash and retard other players chance of victory. Plays better with more players (4+).

One play with six players.  It seems that this game takes several playings to fully grok, and I'm not sure if it's worth the time needed to learn it.  I think by the time I actually figured out some decent strategies, I'd be bored by it.  Willing to give it another chance, though.

Not bad, but I much prefer Wallace's Age of Steam.  One thing both games have in common is scarcity of cash.  In Age of Steam the cash is very tight initially but becomes less of a burden as the game progresses.  In PotR, the need for gold and influence is a constant worry.

In Renaissance Italy, players take the role of condottories, purchasing treachery tiles, soldiers, bidding to be in wars, bidding for city tiles and bidding for artists. Many ways to score VPs (city tiles, pope, money, influence, artists, combat laurels). Not a bad game, clocks in at 2 to 2 1/2 hrs, there is a slight element of chaos (freeze someone's bid, take away someone's soldiers in combat, bidding wars, veto of wars, dice to resolve combat), but if you can look above that, you will enjoy the game. Many things to consider each turn. It does take some work to get the rules sorted out, and takes a few playings to understand the nuances of the game. A couple of people in my gaming group really enjoy this one. However, I'm only lukewarm on it and will only play when others want to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Further plays have improved my opinion of this game, but it will never be one of my favorites. I think my biggest complaint is how much the end-game scoring can swing the balance - it seems too chaotic for a game you have to devote so much concentration to. ***UPDATE 9/5/04*** I have come to the conclusion that the family with the condottierre advantage is much too powerful. As a group we have decided that when playing with 5 or less, this family will be removed. With 6, the players will all be reminded (or made very aware) of the early advantage this power conveys.

Fantastic game with a whole lotta stuff going on. There are a few different viable paths to victory -- for instance, a player could win via military superiority or with no military at all.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Only played once, but it seems much like Wallace's other games that involve combat. Actual combat is simple, but there are many things you can get to modify how it works. Although, it still seems like the outcome is based mainly on the die roll. It almost seems like taking on the role of condotierre to lose is a good idea so you can tank other player's cities. As with most auction games, it would take time to really gauge the value of the various items to be bought.

After my second play, I think there are too many auctions in this one. It seems like everything is contingent on winning some auctions, so it's really hard to plan anything out, since you're never sure what you'll have to spend. If you overspend, then that just makes it easier for everyone else to get things cheaper.

This game makes use of two things I generally dislike. Dice combat and auctions. The problem with this game is that practically everything is an auction. So you're auctioning numerous things in one of the two currencies you have in the game and these things are are of indeterminate value. I get it, you need to play several times to get a handle for the value of everything. I am so tired of hearing this nonsense after I am stuck playing any auction game. If something has a determinable value, then the auctions have interest to me. Otherwise, they're all nonsense. That makes the auctions very group dependent, it will rely on how your game group plays the game.

So, this joins the ranks of Medici and Modern Art as games I am unlikely to ever play again.

150 mins of auctions is a lot of auctions. Even the wars are two auctions followed by a 10 second dice battle. Then more auctions. That's a lot of auctions. Have I mentioned auctions yet? This game is made up of auctions. I'm not sure I want to play again. Even though there's more to explore here because you can try different combinations of winnings (from the auctions) to garner VP's, we get to the end of the game and there's a silence as we ponder whether we actually had fun or not. Anyone for an auction?

The game is built on an extremely delicate and complex balance of options and strong points, which I am sure requires a great deal of work to master (or even come close). The marriage between theme and system is fantastic and very elegant. The only two criticisms I would make concern the rules (could be better structured and made more clear) and the graphic display of the tokens (can be quite confusing at times). File that away and you're left with a truly great, challenging and fun game.

RATING: 7
This is, along with Age of Steam and Byzantium, a member of my holy trinity of Wallace games. Unlike the other two, this has very simple rules: on your turn you put a tile up for auction, buy a tile, start a war or pass. But under this apparently simple engine there's a very deep and complex game, full of strategic choices and tough decisions. There are several completely different ways to win and the game really rewards planing and strategic consistency. A player who doesn't commit to a path will most likely loose.

But this is also a negotiation game and players are even allowed to exchange gold or influence, the 2 existing currencies. This is very true to the renaissance theme and really works gamewise! The level of negotiation present is entirely up to the group, though, and I've played games without any negotiation, where nothing was ever even offered and I've played games with a lot of offers and counter offers being made. I personally prefer the latter style of play, as I think it really makes sense and adds a lot of flavor, but I can understand that some people prefer it the other way around, because there are inherent dangers to negotiation heavy games (time constraints, ganging on one player, etc).

All and all a great game, with a very rich theme and simple rules, which is unusual in a Martin Wallace game. And the rules are even relatively clear which is even more unusual!

Who can play? Strategy game for 3-6 players.

The most original "wargame" I've played.  Tried and true ideas assembled in a completely new way.  Diplomacy was not used so much in our first games, but I expect that will change.  Many facinating intrigues, inciting wars to further your own devious agenda.  Will definitely play again.

A solid auction game in which it pays to collect what others are collecting, but there are always plenty of other contingencies to worry about and distinctive advantages to aim for.

RATING: 5
Not so sure about this one. It has the Modern Art concept of groupthink making a city valuable, which is fine, but the wars drive me a little nuts, and are pretty chaotic, especially considering the treachery cards. I'll admit, though, that I've only played it once, some concepts weren't clear the first time around, and relative value of certain things was kind of lost on me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Much better than I expected. Fortunately, there's no need for anyone to engage in any negotiations. Nice components and art. The 'expansion bundle' seems pretty essential. Personally, I'm not sure how many auction games I need...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great game, especially with 6 people.  The components are high quality, I just wish Warfrog would make larger game boards.  Six typical male gamers around this board gets kind of risky especially after a few Treachery cards have been played!  I'd rate this game even higher if the written rules were clearer.

RATING: 4
Overrated.  I don't think I've ever had so many mixed feelings about one game as I do with PotR.  I've also never thought so much about a game after it's first play.  The core mechanics of the game are pure genius but Martin Wallace threw in a bunch of crap on top like dice-rolling, figity special action cards, open negotiations, and silly tiny rules.  All of this is said only after one play however, I can't wait to try it again.  I think someone like Reiner Knizia needs to strip this game down and make it into a nice business game.

Excellent game. Just jumped into my 10 list from an 8 after my 5th play. It may not be as smooth as some of my other 10's. It definately is not as nice production wise. But this game is INTENSE. There are other reasons why its a 10: length is reasonable, no other game is as emotionally involved (where people get really wrapped up and emotions flare up, people can get upset at eachother) it is usually and intense experience. Everyone cares about every move, critiques everyone else's move, there is manipulations, alliances, backstabbing. This is one great game so deserves its up in rank.

Dropped my rating. Still intense and fun game play but turn order disadvantage ruins it for me. Calvary tile to the first 4 players is huge in a game where fighting and influence is so important

RATING: 7.5
Based on one play: very complex, and very interesting, defintely want to play it again sometime, but I felt 'out of control' during most of the game.  In the end, my powerful army had NO effect; the city I favored ended dead last, while the city I wanted last ended first, overwhelming my points for battles. I can't tell if that was my bad strategy or a flaw in the game, so I need to play it ten more times to find out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Many things going on, different path to victory, tough decisions, clear rules (yes !) and very good components (ugly map though).
A bit confusing at first as you do not know what to do but when you begin to understand it is getting better and better.
I tend to find that the wars are a bit too complicated (it is nearly impossible to see what will happen exactly when you start a war).
My note goes up from 8 to 9 after 4 plays.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
PotR has a lot of intense auctions, which I really like. In fact the game is all about auctions and bidding for various city or event tiles. Rules are not complicated, but players have many options to choose from. In the endgame it can be challenging to figure out who's really in the lead. Components aren't as bad as I thought. Actually I like the look and feel of the tiles. Even the board is adequate for this type of game. There's some typos in the tiles and in the rules, check also the errata in the web. Wallace's games would surely deserve a more thorough publisher.

I can see that Martin Wallace is a brilliant game designer, but I have difficulty playing his games unless I'm in the exact right mood.

I prefer games that have a clear goal and clear paths to that goal.  When there are too many things for me to keep an eye on at once, it tends to fry my brain, and the fun factor goes down.

This is one of those games that I simply can't play if my goal is to relax after a hard day at work (which it usually is).

RATING: 7
In this classic heavy Martin Wallace game whose prices had gotten stupid before the reprint, you play noble families in Italy who bid for people, events, and armies with two currencies, Gold and Influence, and start wars between cities then bid Influence to be their Condottieri in order to get paid in Gold and adjust the status of the cities depending on who wins and loses, so sometimes you want to defend a city where you don't own anything and get paid to tank their reputation.  At the end of the game, points are mostly from stuff you bought based on the associated city's reputation.

It actually plays faster than the box claims; we got through a four-player game with first-timers in about two hours, though playing with a full six might get you to the stated 180 minutes.  Speed is rather dependent on how quickly people can decide on their bids, as the game is basically a series of auctions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If you think about it, it's really just a two hour version of Magellan (Pizzaro & co). I like auction games, but this game needs some variation to truly make it a good game. Sure there are delicate touches here and there - it's just that a two hour plus game made up of one auction after another tends to leave the players a bit drained. Lots of interesting paths to take to victory. There's enough going on to keep the game fresh for repeat playing. No starting position on the board. Wrong text on a treachery tile. Surely they could find a group of playtesters. Of concern to me is the negotiation element - I really don't like it - a kingmaking invitation.

RATING: 9
I couldn't stop thinking about this one afterward. It wasn't just that I thought of moves I would have done in that particular game--though I did do that. Rather, I was thinking about completely different strategies I'd like to try from the get-go--just to see how they'd play out. I hope to play this many more times; I hope the game group wants to, too.

RATING: 8.5
Have played this game a couple of times, with 4 & 6 players.  The gameplay is actually exciting at times with different people wanting different outcomes of a certain auction, or a certain battle.  I've seen subterfuge (people putting up items for auction that they don't want, hoping others will reduce their gold or influence), negotiation, and many different strategies.  This is a magnificent game, and I look forward to my rating going up with more playings.

Our gaming group favourite and our favourite Martin Wallace´s game, it´s all about backstabbing the people that was your best ally 20 minutes ago, it´s clearly impossible to predict the winner until the very last moment of the game.

It has a small problem with king-maker moves that changes the winner in the very last moment, but it is a part of the game that we have accepted and I really enjoy finishing second after all the players on the table have to join to cut my rush to the victory.

Essentially a stock manipulation game (with each "share" also giving unique benefits!), PotR provides a cool and intricate economic system that players are involved in on multiple levels. Lots of opportunities for bribes, etc. 

And you get PAID to lose battles!

The problem is that the length and player screwage makes it hard to get on the table.

This has recently been replaced in my mind by Imperial, which has a similar investment plus manipulation feel but is better developed.

RATING: 2
This in my opinion is the definition of a fiddly game. The components are awkward with small wording, the layout is very small, and the mechanics feel clumsy at best.

The big killer for me was the lack of a clearly defined endgame. The game happens to end when the special cards (4) for each of 3 ages are all bought up. 

In theory this seems to give players more control about ending the game, but in practice it does not work very well. A person can just toss cards out, pass on them, and make the game end very quickly if they don't care about loosing the bid. Because somebody has to claim it with a high bid, even if it's for 0.

It was just a very clunky game and was not at all enjoyable to play. I like the people I game with a lot and I felt bad telling them the game was not too good, but it really was tedious to play for almost 2 hours.

I like the balance in this game.  Any one of multiple strategies are completely viable to dominate.  The only downside is that the turn can absolutely make or break the game, and it can easily be someone else's action that destroys a faction in the end.  One move can swing everything from great to horrid or vice versa.

Definately requires heavy planning and strategy, as well as table interaction and assessing your opponents.  An excellent game.

Splendid! An excellent auction game. It ranks up there with other auctions games like 'Modern Art', and 'Traumfabrik'. One of the most brilliant designs of 2003.

Not since my virgin plunge into Dune did I love a game as much as I love this on the first play.  I'm a big fan of auction and negotiation games so this seemed like a natural in for me, still it blew away all my expectations.  Brilliant meld of European and American design.  Heavily steeped in theme and color.  Sure, the board isn't the greatest (but it excels in clarity), the rulebook is a mess and there is errata, but what lies beneath is a genius game.

RATING: 6
I am really surprised that I didn't like this more.  It may be a case where more familiarity with the system will improve the experience.  
My problem here was that there were so many choices of what to try to acquire each turn, and it was often far from clear which choices would be best, especially since the city values are pegged to a series of unpredictable wars.  This triggered my mutant form of AP: instead of sitting frozen at the board, I make a quick, arbitrary choice and hope for the best.  Again, I realize that some of this was probably down to a lack of familiarity with the options, but I think more of it is due to the chaotic war setup, which while thematically sound, doesn't grab me as a game mechanism.

Played one 3p game, which isn't really its sweet spot.  Interesting "war" game, where no battles are actually fought.  Instead, you are paid to have your army show up and compare dong size with another army.  Here's the great thing -- win or lose, you get paid!

This game features a variety of tokens to enhance your presence economically, militarily, and politically, much like SoE.  These are drafted from a pool (some permanently, some are discarded after use, and some return to the pool after the round).  Thus you can try different approaches to enhancing your influence on repeat plays.

I can't really assess gameplay at this point; I need to see it with the full complement of players.

A quality meaty game.  I really enjoy how all the actions are connected and you just don't feel like you have enough.  While so many things can be auctioned, you have to selectively choose when to enter a war or purchase a family tile because you just don't have enough money or influence to win a bunch of auctions. My sole complaint is that it can really drag with AP-prone players, which prevents me from moving this up to a 9.

I absolutely loved this game, from the second we started it ticked all the right boxes ... bidding, set collection, treachery, wars ...it reminded me a little of Junta and a lot like intrigue but with typical wallace simplicity and depth, it really is remarkable.

Very cool game! I think this needs repeated play to fully appreciate (although it's not as odd as Liberte). There might be a bit too much auctioning in this game for me.

RATING: 9
Neat heavier-weight multiplayer game.  There are lots of valid strategies to pursue.  A bit long with 6.

Auction game where you buy army units or personalities from different Italian cities. (Kind of a stock-market game in that you are investing in those cities, which will pay off according to their final status.) You can initiate wars between two cities. Players bid influence for the right to fight for both sides. You might, however be planning to lose the fight. (You can't throw the fight, but you can win the influence auction with a weak army.) Several strategic paths are available--getting points through the "stock market", points for winning battles, using your strong or weak army to arrange which cities win battles (you can even be strong offensively and weak defensively, giving you 2 chances to influence the battle), or just getting stuff cheaply. And you can get yourself declared pope.

RATING: 8
Not nearly as imposing as it first appears, but there are numerous approaches that could work.  I can see where with each play different layers would reveal themselves.  One of those games I feel like playing again immediately.  A great combination of strategic depth and easy to grasp mechanics. You really have to manage your resources carefully, especially your influence points.

A great game. Full of interaction, lots of strategy, excelent mechanics. It has to see the table much more often.
I've played it with three players only and it doesn't work. Minimum requested 4 but it gets better with more.

Once again Martin Wallace released a game that has a very unique feeling. Different strategies may be applied to achieve your goals and I've seen them work. All of them! I like when a game is full of difficult choices not only in its mechanics but also as a path to win.

Played with four players. I like it more and more. I don't know any strategy that could prevail everytime I play it and that's a great thing. It does make things even more difficult to me but it's a great thing for a game. It becomes different everytime I play it and usually I don't have a clue about what I am going to do before playing it. Go with the flow and do your best.

UPDATE: September 2011
The game aged well I guess but I think I like others better. PoR is almost all about auctioning but what really bugs me is that for a game of such an intensity I don't feel I control it. All the events are so much bigger than what players can control that I have the feeling that what happens is not about what I did but about the general overcome of a storyline that everyone built. I take my own decisions, make my own actions but depend too much on what others decide to do. And dice, although controled, may unbalance a game for one side or another... Downgrade the rate from an 8 to a 7.

RATING: 7
Surprisingly simple stock-market game set in Renaissance Italy; "stocks", purchased by auction, are members of noble houses associated with one of the great city-states of the late 15th century -- Medici in Florence, Sforza in Milan, Borgia in Rome and so on. Some are mere merchants, who provide only money, others grant influence and/or special powers (e.g. Il Magnifico: veto one war per period).

Presumably this was a theme-first design -- 15th century Italy was a strange place, where city-states had no standing armies of their own and fought by proxy using mercenaries. The value of the "stocks", including their reserve prices in the auctions, is largely determined by these wares; players bid influence for the right to fight on behalf of one city or the other (being paid, of course, for their brave service). Battles are decided by dice roll.

What arguably holds it above is the thematic element and the depth of choices around wars -- you can be deliberately weak and bid to defend a city you want to go down in value, for example, or deliberately drive down a city's reputation to lower the cost of its nobles/stocks. It's all about Machiavellian negotiation and manipulation (even manipulating the election of the pope!) to increase the wealth and prestige of your noble family.

But there are so very many stock market games around that competition is fierce. The different special powers and treachery cards do add an unusual degree of texture (more "glorious mess" than mathematical elegance), with corresponding difficulty in evaluating their worth at auction, and the random elements are both gross and unnecessary. A good game. I'm not sold that it's a great one.

I had very high expectations for this one and maybe that's why it didn't impress me as much as I thought it would. I enjoyed the game and I really think that it's a good game but there were some features that made me feel abit awkward (maybe it was the printing errors on some cards or maybe it was the dice in a "serious" strategy game like this... I don't know). I'm however looking forward to trying it again because I really want to give it another chance.

An auction / stockmarket game where you get to buy artillery, auction the pope and declare war between two cities. After that learning game, I'm keen to play again soon, and I'm really, really, hoping this will become a regular at our sessions so that we can play with experienced players.

Sadly, this rarely got played so it was given away to a better home.

If not for being out of print, this would be the next game I must own.  Being out of print means this might be my 'next' grail game.

It has an interesting mechanic where you represent a family, and each family has an interest in five different cities.  So your primary goal is to help cities you have an interest in, while hurting cities you don't. You help and hurt these cities by spending your family's influence to fight for them in battles.

Say I want Rome to do better than Venice in the end. I have a lousy army, while you have a wonderful army. On my turn, I choose to declare war between Rome and Venice. I then bribe you to fight for Rome, while I fight for Venice. We both get paid money to represent the city in battle. Your army thwomps mine, so you get a laurel for winning the fight. Rome decimates Venice, so Rome goes up on the score track and Venice goes down. Sure, it costs a lot of influence to make sure this happens, but I've been saving some influence all game to make this happen so I get the result I need in the end!)

Lot of treachery and negotiation.  Excellent game with the right group!

What a fantastic game! It mixes so many mechanics I enjoy. It's like Wallace read my mind over the course of a few years and collected all of my favorite elements of other games I own, and combined them into a very streamlined version of a game. Brilliance. Now I just need to find a copy somehow. There's talk of a reprint right now, but I can never trust that will happen, nor if it does how long it will actually be until it's in stores.

So good.

Ugh.  Not my type of game.  Any game where the last place player can have 6 treachery tiles played on them in the last round with as pleasant a group of people as I played with is not my cup of tea.  I was really excited to give this a try and looked forward to the game, but dreaded the last 90 minutes or so as the self-fulfilling prophecy unfurled.  Your mileage, of course, may vary.

Taking the BGG rating system literally, this is a 2 for me.  I won't ever play it again - if it went well, it might be fine, but if it went badly - yikes!

Very heavy bidding mechanics with limited resources. I know I haven't played enough to fully grasp the value of all auctioned pieces, but I liked it very much just the same.

DIY version. Strange how gold seems to exit the system early as players buy up the troops that never need to be replaced. At least that simplifies the latter two decades.

Especially at first I feel aimless in this game. Plenty of things I could do on my turn but not that much urgency to do one thing over another.

It bothers me how unpredictable the effect of starting a war can be. The player who spends his turn to start it picks the cities that fight, but two auctions (for attacker/defender) and 1-2 dice rolls can result in a lot of different possible outcomes. Also, if the only point of the war was to make some money or win a victory, there may be many possible wars that would give that same result. The side effects of the particular war may be arbitrary.

This is basically a commodity speculation game where you buy shares in cities and attempt (via the unpredictable wars) to increase the value of those shares. It will be interesting to compare with Imperial once I get around to that game.

...Down from 6.5 to 6 on realizing that I never bothered to brainstorm variants for the game because I don't even know what good attribute I am trying to bring to the foreground.

Three plays have failed to reveal this as anything exceptional, despite my soft spot for many of Wallace's war games.  My plays have all been on a homemade copy that kept the same mechanics but with a theme of modern wars in the Middle East.  The game makes it very hard to strategically plan, but it requires constant judging of strategy as the various faction cards are auctioned off.  How likely is it that this faction will be worth 2 points?  How likely will it be that it'll be worth 10 points?  Which will happen is largely dependent on the choices of the other players in a way that is nearly impossible to predict.  It's chaotic in a fashion which I really don't enjoy, despite a usual hearty appetite for chaos.  I'm not convinced that the winner will usually be the person who played the best.

Martin Wallace at his best in my view. A game where stocks are auctioned and then manipulated via warfare, with your typical Wallace wantonly sprinkled special powers everywhere.

Deciding which one of several potentially critical actions to take when it comes around to you is deliciously tense.

Solid Martin Wallace game and one of his better ones in my opinion. A few fiddly rules but that is too be expected. Quite a lot going on but in a good way. The art and color scheme are better then normal Wallace games but not as good as A Study in Emerald or Discworld. I would hesitate to play this again with 6 players as the downtime is a bit much. I think 4-5 would be perfect.

The design of the game is OK, but there's way too much going on for my tastes, it takes too freakin' long to play the game for what I get out of it, and it's possible (and frustrating) to be that one player out of the game who says "Pass" every round, for lack of any resources to do anything.  Add in to the mix the fact that all players really need to understand what all the different tiles do and how they affect the game, and it means that every turn is spent with another player analyzing all the remaining tiles.  It's fine if everyone knows the game, but how often are you going to find players with that much experience with the game?

This is not a family game.  I have only played it once: I made a few beginner blunders - but my military strategy proved effective and in the final score I won a very narrow victory.  The second place player had a tiny army, but used a strategy of all-out treachery.  I dominated the wars of the 2nd and 3rd decade, using most of my influence to become the attacker or defender whenever possible, and I ended the game with 7 laurels.  This game is out of print - but I wouldn't buy it if I could, although I'd play it again.  It was only really in the 3rd decade that there were serious alliances and negotiation - but it wasn't as meanspirited as it might have become.  There is potential for this game to be way too cruel and mean for my tastes.

RATING: 6.5
Despite the deceptively short rules (basically 4 pages), the game demands a lot from first time players. As with any auction game, players need to be able to gauge the relative value and importance of items being offered so they can bid intelligently. When you only have a few items available at a time, or work within a discrete set of items, that can be easily managed. 

In Princes of the Renaissance, however, every tile is available from the outset. That means knowing and understanding the relative values of 8 different army tiles and 30 provincial tiles from 5 different regions. You need to know their relative value to yourself, if you want to bid/purchase them, as well as their relative value to each other player, in case you want to auction it off. And the relative value over purchasing/auctioning the tile compared to the value of instigating a war or taking one of the other actions available. This need for omniscience has turned several prospective players from the game. I've only gotten to play five times now, with three aborted attempts once the game was set up, as folks had no idea how to filter all that information.

So many ways to win in this game!  You cannot stick with a one dimensional strategy throughout the whole game.  This game shines with 4-5 players.  Three is okay.

Upon more playings, my rating for this one has slipped a bit.  You're at the mercy of what other players do; so through no fault of your own, they can screw you and there's nothing that can be done about it.  I don't like that lack of control in games; at least give *some* semblance of control.

Tentative rating based on a single solo play to learn rules.  Have to play face to face to appreciate auctions and battles.

마틴 월레스 게임은 주로 산업화 시대를 다루고 있어서 별 달리 흥미를 느끼지 않았다. 실제로 AOS는 아직도 해보지 않았고, 브라스도 생각보다 별로 재미없더라.. 단, 개인적으로 호감이 가는 르네상스 시기, 게다가 로렌초 메디치, 체사레 보르지아, 일 모로 등이 활약하는 르네상스 후기의 이탈리아가 배경인 이 게임은 오랜 기다림 끝에 사게 되었다. 그리고테플로 조민우, 남민구랑 에러플 한 번 돌려보고, 3355에서 임가드 및 그의 친구랑 한 판 돌렸다. 총 2판 돌렸는데, 2번째 판은 별로 재미가 없더라.. 좀 인원 타는 게임.

Clever, and nearly great. Having the worst army is as good as having the best army, and a lot cheaper.

A political and strategic game about Italian Renaissance. The war is only a way to gain more gold, and the best warchief is not always the best player. Control the Pope and use the family's ability to gain influence. It's really a good game. Easy rule and simple turn fases

If you like tons of pointless and uninteresting auctions, this is the game for you.

Basically auction game.  But, containing wars and economics and cultures.  Very tense and a little bit heavy game.

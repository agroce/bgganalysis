A disappointment. Surprisingly limited options, even for an intro game aimed at younger ages. Simpler than I expected/wanted, while also too clunky to be a pleasant casual game. I'm amazed this is sold as a standalone game; it should be the training scenario from a more complete game.

I have yet to play the rest of the franchise, but I still intend to do so, but I wouldn't buy or seek to play this one again.

I get the feeling that I will like this game the more I play it.  My wife and I have tried it a couple of times, but she doesn't really get it.  I like a lot of the changes to the rules from the original Evolution.  My son is too young to play now, but in a couple of years, I think he will really get a kick out of this game.

Purchased at GenCon 2016.

I'm a fan of the original Evolution, and this is a streamlined version that makes it easier to play with my kids (8 and 6).  I prefer the full game, but this is a good simplification of the game to make it more kid friendly.

Aside from many of the simplifications, the watering hole only gets 2 pieces of food on each person's turn.  I think this is a great change as it prevents over feeding the watering hole and really makes you think to feed all of your species.

Rating after 3 games played.

Bought for $1 @ garage sale. 

The carnivore with thick fats is a kingmaker. 

Played 3 times, tried new strategies each time. The game is ok, would probably be a hit for nongamers but we have other games that are better.

For nongamers, rate 7-8
For gamers, rate 5

Simple to learn and surprisingly engaging. You do tend to get a bit attached to your creatures and feel bad if a predator eats them. Might be interesting to try one of the bigger versions, as I think we'd enjoy a little more complexity as long as it didn't slow things down.

A bit simpler than its bigger brother "Evolution", but an improvement I think. It's just as luck-driven, but as it plays quicker and still has the same strong thematic feel as its predecessor its more balanced. This hits the mark in terms of playtime, planning, theme and fun.

The card game version of Evolution is fun, but definitely simplified. I think I prefer the card interactions in the base game.

The Longneck trait feels overpowered - especially since you are likely to be limited to 2 food each turn (unless the player before you left food for you).

I definitely think that player order affects the game.

I played the prototype of Evolution: The Beginning and loved it. It is a simpler, more streamlined version of Evolution and I loved that. I'm sure it will depend on the mood I'm in, how much time I have, and who I'm playing with when deciding which to play but I'm pretty sure because of the length this will get more plays. And, it's a nice way to introduce people to Evolution. If they love it and want more, then move on to the others. Love it. Definite buy for me.

Evolution Junior, I believe exclusively at Target. 

Most of the same general mechanics as Evolution. A few alterations to make it the junior version. Of note, instead of playing a round as a group, each player completes their full turn separately. 

I liked it a lot for a junior version of the game.

Played a demo at Origins 2016.  Since this is a simpler version of Evolution, it will be much easier to teach to new players.  Especially players who have not played many complex board games.

I love Evolution, but some of my regular gaming friends think it's too complex. This game is more streamlined while still maintaining the aspects I like so much about its bigger brother: evolving your creatures happens naturally which makes it very strong thematically. And still love the amazing art! Reminds me of San Juan vs Puerto Rico.

RATING: 7
Interesting games work both as a strategic game with 10-xx years and "funplay" with 6-10 years.

Some rules should be clarified more in the rule book:
- Is long neck + carnivorous a valid combination
- How many defencive properties as the maximum for plant breeders, as it is now, you can make plant breeders impossible to attack with three defensive moves.

Three words: Simple, fast, strategy

(funplay is my word for not keeping the rules so tight and concentrating on getting through the game together)

I've thought about getting Evolution before, but then thought it looked kinda dry. This version was a great intro to the game.

Haven't played the original, but this game was a blast with me and my wife. The ebb and flow of carnivores vs prey and the extinction of either/both when food runs low is really thematic and may even be a good introductory educational representation of how evolution and ecology works hand in hand.

Don't know how long this may stay in the fold however as it's a bit simplistic and the replayability isn't there with the limited amount of cards - but planning on getting Evolution: Climate. May keep this around as a good gateway game depending on how complex/long Climate is.

I was a bit hesitant to play this because I was quite bored by my one play of the original Evolution. But I actually liked this one slightly more! It pretty much takes the core card play mechanics from Evolution and make a game out of them. It feels very samey to the earlier game but cleaned up and fast enough that it's easier to appreciate the core mechanics. That being said, it still felt a little uninteresting throughout and after making some cool creatures I was just sort of done with it. What you draw can make a huge difference in how well you do, though there are enough options with what you do with your cards that I enjoyed the light puzzle. It's okay and a good filler for light players but not a game that excites me. Wonderful art though and great component quality.

I think I like this better than Evolution.  I like the simplified food (2 per turn as opposed to playing cards to determine pool) and I like using cards for population and new species as opposed to the cubes.  The only thing I felt the original had that was better was more variety to the trait cards.  With an expansion, E:Beginning would definitely top the original.

The current design trend of taking full-fledged games and distilling them down to their base elements enrages me simply because the best designers are [I]so good at it[/I] that no one wants to bother playing the Mother Game anymore.  [I]Sigh.[/I]  In the Bad Old Days simplifying a game usually meant taking out what made it interesting; now it's getting rid of everything that makes the game inaccessible and long.  A good thing to get people into it and play more often, but terrible when what I'd really like is the full-boat experience.*

So this is pretty good in that it [I]feels[/I] like the original but plays in a fraction of the time with rules so straightforward that even n00bs can jump right in and be competitive—almost like a party game.  I just hope it doesn't [thing=143741]BANG! Dice[/thing] me...**

[size=7]*Look, I ordered the Patriot Dog specifically to see a hot dog with a sparkler stuck in it—without the sparkler it's just a goddamn hot dog and anyone can have one of those whenever.

I had high hopes for Evolution: The Beginning. Unfortunately, it was a major letdown. The outside of the box and numerous respected reviewers emphasized how this game is "highly strategic for two players". THIS IS FLAT-OUT WRONG! With just two players, the game is tedious and repetitive. It boils down to a race to see who can have two species with the long neck trait in play the longest until the end of the game. Using the carnivore trait is fruitless, especially considering the number of defensive traits that make it utterly impossible to use.  Even worse, your card hand size just keeps growing... and growing... and GROWING. Do you know how frustrating it is to have a hand full of dozens of cards and no species to play them on? Very! Unless you're going to play in a large group, avoid Evolution: The Beginning.

Szerintem jól sikerült változat. Aki esetleg körülményesnek érezte az eredeti Evolúciót, ezzel jobban járhat. Gyors, tematikus, jól működik kettesben, ilyen folyamatos adok-kapoknak érződik. :) Igaz, nyelvfüggő, de nagyon kevés fajta kártya van, néhány kör alatt megjegyezhető. Szóval nem csak egy felesleges bőrlehúzás, van helye a kártyavilágban. :)

I recently bought this game from Target in November. It was only $20 suprisingly! The first time I played it with my brother, the instructions were a little hard to understand. The second time I played it with a friend, however, the gameplay went pretty smoothly but we still had some conflicts. As the box says, this game is highly strategic for even just two players. It required a lot of thinking about gathering food, placing the different traits, and getting more points than your fellow opponent. It seems like if I had played with 3-5 people the game would have been more complicated and required even more strategic thinking, which would be more time consuming. Each time I have played so far, it took around 1 hour and 40 minutes to finish. Overall, I found this game enjoyable and I will play it again very soon.

08/20/16 Brought at Target for $24.99 + tax. This was the first time I've bought a game "retail" in over 15 years. Why? I did not want to wait until July 2017 to buy it from an on-line vendor, since Target had an exclusive deal with the publisher for  a year. 
12/13/16 I got around the playing the game solitaire to learn it. And I had several questions. I was then somewhat shocked that there were, as of today, 51 question threads! How could a game that was supposedly an intro level affair, with such a brief rule book, have so many?! Yet after reading the threads I found most were legitimate. Wow! Is this a case of poor rule writing? Well... not exactly. When you read the rules they *seem* very clear. Yet when you play there are constant questions about how the traits on the cards interact with each other and/or the game in general. Its nice the designer has answered all the questions. But I'd say he or the publisher should still post a FAQ. One thing I did not anticipate before buying, when playing with five it takes up a *lot* of table space, even though its "just a card game" .
12/27/16 Finally played (a three-player) game with others, and rated the game.
08/08/17 Played another three-player game. 12/12/17 Played a four-player game.

I really enjoy this game. It's a very simple and streamlined card game that really does mimic evolution in the real world. You grow and adapt your species and stay reactive against other species (especially carnivores), It's exceptionally easy to learn. My only criticism is a a bit based around the balance of some of the traits - having a long neck seems to win you the game quite easily if there are no predators for your species.

[b]Evolution: The Beginning[/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> [b]8[/b]):[/COLOR]

[i]When I looked back I was surprised at how little Evolution: The Beginning has been played. I actually have enjoyed playing this quite a bit and so has my older daughter. I definitely prefer it as a 2p game, with 3 there is a kingmaking issue due to the way carnivores work. However; with 2 this game moves along briskly and has quite a bit of back and forth battling as you try and anticipate or respond to what kind of species your opponent is creating. There is also a surprising amount of strategy even though there are only ten different traits in the game; the amount of synergy between the traits is impressive. Gameplay is brisk, our games are over in about a half hour. If you play a lot of 2p games and enjoy confrontation then I'd highly recommend checking out Evolution: The Beginning.

As an aside; I had originally played Evolution and wasn't overly keen on it, but I'm interested in playing again to see how it compares to this version. I may just wait for the recently announced [blogpost=63784]Evolution: Oceans[/blogpost] [i](working title)[/i] version that will be coming out.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8 -> 8):[/COLOR]

[i]A surprise hit for me, I ended up getting this one because it was supposed to be more streamlined and play well with 2. It delivers on both counts which is a win for me. While I enjoyed Evolution, it was too long when compared to the depth of game play. I really appreciate how streamlined The Beginning is, it plays fast and the player interaction is still high! Table space required has also shrunk making this a great cafe/pub game since everything in the game is now a card. For those familiar with Evolution, this version is basically the greatest hots of the different evolution cards from the original game with carnivores becoming a much more viable option right out of the gate. For the price point I'd definitely recommend checking out Evolution: The Beginning.[/i]

Seems like there is a runaway leader problem with two players?  At first blush, seems to me that three-player will work best.  Traded.

This is like a drug dealer's sample to see if you like the high and yes I do. A good introduction into the main Evolution game and system. Even at this limited level itbis very cut throat so don't play with people with egos that are bruised easily like a Georgia peach. Very good game for all ages.

I very rarely impulse-purchase a game I've not researched, but while visiting the US, I happened upon Evolution: The Beginning in Target and was intrigued. A quick BGG check revealed that it's (for now) exclusive to Target and sounded interesting. I hold North Star and Dominic in high esteem and enjoy science-y themes, so figured at $25 it was worth a shot. 

I've only got to play once so far, a 2p game, and I really enjoyed it. I've not played the 'big brother' game so can't make a comparison, but there was enough to think about in this streamlined version. It's sort of a tableau/engine-builder, but with the nice feature that your tableau is constantly trying to eat your opponent's (and vice versa). Hope to play again soon and see how it scales to more players.

RATING: 7.4
Underrated card game that plays well at 2 players. A bit more focused on eating/defending than i would like it to be. Not sure you need this if you have Evolution. Doesn't get on the table that often due to obvious Take That mechanic but we still enjoy it. Wish the german version had the card art of the english version though.

I bought this for my daughter. It's not the real evolution, but it still gets the job done in a much easier way. But I like complexity of the real Evolution. I like lots of mechanics. This kind of scratched the itch, but like scratching it with poison ivy. It's going to itch realy bad later.

RATING: 3
When I first started the game I was enjoying it, but stopped the game before the halfway point, because the game was no longer interesting. I ended up with turns where I couldn't add more species because there was only so much food out there, and I didn't draw a Carnivore card, or the Long Neck card, so there was no point, and the other player had Carnivores but had to eat their own species because the other player was too well protected and it wasn't getting the right cards anymore.

The other dinosaurs both had long necks so they were just chomping down on guaranteed points and definitely killing the other player, so there was nothing more to play there either, and I looked at the draw pile and I still had at least half the deck left to slog through and...blech.

This should be a 10 minute game, not a 45 minute one. And even then it wouldn't be a great one. I'm not a huge fan of the game this is simplified from, but it's a better game than this.

RATING: 7
A great game. I'll start with the problems though:

First of all, it's a card game. Just a card game. Some absolutely useless items have been added to the box to make it bigger, and thus be able to sell it for a price that is too high for a card game of this size - this is really disappointing.

Second, it get's rather messy on the board, as you lay out a lot of cards next to each other - it's very difficult to play this with 4 players on an average table due to this.

Third, the food (basically victory point) tokens ONLY come in 1's, there are no 5's or 10's. As you end up with almost 100 points at the end of the game, I guess you can imagine that this, too, gets messy.

Those are the things I dislike about this game. As you may have noticed, I didn't mention any critique regarding the actual game - because I can't think of one. It's basically perfect for what it is.

If you want a VERY easy to learn, but still surprisingly tactically deep card game with a lot of interaction (it doesn't get more hostile than eating your opponent's creatures, does it?), you should definetly play this.

RATING: 5
Fun little game, but a couple of the cards are way better than others. Makes the game pretty uneven, unless people gang up on the person getting the good cards. Drags down the score a lot for me. Feels more like random good luck when you win and random bad luck when you lose.

This is a mass-market version of Evolution, streamlined and simplified and destined to be a Target exclusive! Plus, it's a finished design ready to publish and sell -- yay!

I say simplified, and it is, but in a very good way. In fact, I could see myself playing this version much more than the full game: it's easier to remember the rules, easier to get to the table, and yet preserves a lot of the feel of the original game! It's a great addition to the Evolution family!

This game uses cards for everything (except food): face up for traits, as usual; face down for each population. There are only 10 traits here: 5 defensive, 1 carnivore, and 4 others (10 cards each?). Every turn, add 2 food to the water hole. You get one new species (face down card) + 3 cards in your hand. Play your cards how you like (as traits and/or population); may hold some till later (no hand limit). At the end of your turn, any unfed population (face down cards) are discarded; all consumed food is stored in your bag. Game ends when deck runs out (finish round; even turns). Earn 1 VP per food in bag, 1 VP per card in hand/table; most VP wins!

This one surprised me with it's quick-playing yet strategic back-and-forth struggle to survive. With three players, there was a bit of a kingmaker issue, however, and I suspect that the game would be best with two or perhaps four. One thing is for sure: if one of the design goals was to get players interested in the Evolution line, it succeeded.

RATING: 8
A constantly changing card game. Surprisingly good for 2 players. Have not played with 5, but 4 people seems to work pretty well.

The game itself is quite unique compared to other card games I have played. Upon first reading the directions, I would have rated this a 5 or so. However, after playing 8 games, I have found that this really is very entertaining with considerable strategy. It is a little rough to teach to new players despite its low complexity. But once the rules are understood, gameplay is smooth and quick. One thing I especially like about the game is that the board state is constantly changing. I also like that both sides of each card are utilized in the game. The strategy changes considerably depending on the number of players.

I give the game an 8 overall for its uniqueness and entertainment value. The components and art are also very nice. I would recommend this to anyone who is reasonably capable of learning new somewhat complex board games.

Very enjoyable game. Not sure whether it can be played truly competitively as part of the build-up in the game involves waiting for a carnivore or long-neck card to turn up. This is a minor fault though as the game is so fast and there are some tactics to be explored for maximising points. Look forward to trying the full game out and seeing if it's better balanced.

A stripped down version of Evolution, using a "the Card Game" approach. Plays much more cleanly and faster than Evolution. I liked it, but not as much as some of the others I plaayed with. I miss Cooperation chains too much.  But even with the small number of traits, there are still interesting combos and moves you can pull off.

What a great family game. There is attacking each other, but it never feels mean and has not led to any hurt feelings in our 8 or 14 year-olds. Rather, it creates fun tensions and has a very interesting ebb and flow as species rise and decline (or appear and then disappear).

As said by many others,  is the pocket version of Evolution. Basically, the company removed some cards so there is not interaction among cards such as mutualisms, warning call, etc. Just this change makes it shorter and with less decissions to take. I find Evolution too expensive and too lengthy for what it does, Evolution (Big) sometimes makes you feel you are wasting your time because it turns to be repetitive. The Beginning is shorter and with a simple strategy, so the repetitive aspect feels lesser. In the other hand, and depending on the players,  Evolution:Climate feels like the same as The beginning, it is in when  players focus only on traits, leaving aside the Climate Change scale.  

I miss the interactive cards here, though, but as in real-life evolution is a trade-off. It is an excelent game, 1/3 of the Father Evolution and you still enjoy it on lunch time. Buy it. Perfect for kids.
[edit] I found that the retail price of The beginning is quite close to the Climate game. I am not sure if it worths now, but if you can find it for less than 20 it worths.

RATING: 6
It is a surprisingly faithful distillation of the [family=16886][/family] series. It is mechanically quite simple, while maintaining a good portion of the feel. I think this is about as close as Evolution can get to being a true mass-market game, and I hope it does well.

I prefer the watering hole suspense of its older brother, but this certainly is not a bad option at game time!

A szabályt elolvasva az Evolutionhöz képest egyszerűsödött a játékmenet, a testméret eltűnésével gyorsabban és könnyebben átlátni a ki kit támadhat meg kérdéskört. Érzésem szerint ez most egy még gyorsabb adok-kapok lesz, melyben a kétfős játékmód is megerősödött.

Teljesen jó, kedvelem az ilyen gyors kártyajátékokat, ez pedig a téma miatt mindig is tetszett. Simább, tisztább érzés a The Beginning. :)

RATING: 10
Yup, I'm giving it a 10. I am an Evolution fanboy. I wish I could play Evolution multiple times a day. My only problem is finding folks to teach the game to and hoping that they're interested in investing the time into a full playthrough. 

Enter Evolution: The Beginning.  I now have an option to get ~75% of the satisfaction of playing the 'big brother' games, teach it in half the time, answer 1/4 of the questions, and leave my opponents wanting to play again and again.  I am positive that I'll be able to get this to the table twice as often. What's better is that the folks I play with will be able to scurry off and buy their own copy for $25. That means that this game could start popping up on tables right behind Phase 10 or Rummy. That makes me a happy, happy Evolution-geek.

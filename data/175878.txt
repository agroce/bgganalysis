Impossible to rate at this point. The concept is brilliant. The rulebook needed to be equally brilliant to make this work - and unfortunately, it's very difficult to use. This makes for a frustrating experience learning each of the worlds. Nonetheless, there is a ton to explore here, and I've hardly scratched the surface.

Few games only and I didn't even explore all the modules.

The game however seems interesting. I'm particularly found in exploring shares module.

[b]Disclaimer:[/b] I have not played this game 504 times.  In fact, I have not even played it with all of the modules included in the game.  I have a very limited perspective on the game, so keep that in mind while reading my opinion.

I have played this game twice, using the same 3 modules, though in a slightly different order.  My first play was a 2-player game of world 521: exploration, racing, and pick-up-and-deliver.  This play resulted in a snowballing effect because the point-scoring and money-collecting goals were so similar.  The player who had better luck finding cities early won the game running away.

I found this outcome disappointing, so I wanted to see if swapping the last two modules would result in a more interesting game, so when I got my game group to play this with me 4-player, we played world 512.  This game did not have the same snowballing effect, but like the first game, the outcome felt far too random.  Perhaps this is just the result of the exploration module being in the point-scoring position, but these two plays did give me some insight into the game (or perhaps it's more accurately called a game system) itself.

First, I must compliment Friedemann Friese on the design of the game.  I recognize that designing 504 is a brilliant accomplishment.  Creating a system in which 9 disparate modules can be combined in any 3-module permutation to create a playable game is no small feat.  And though learning the game for the first time was exceptionally challenging, particularly figuring out a combination of modules for which there was no video demonstration available, I feel I could learn the rules for other worlds much more quickly if I end up coming back to this game.

Which brings me to my second point: 504 proves in my mind that a game is more than simply the sum of its parts.  Each of the modules in 504 is well designed, and when combined I am confident they are all playable.  The problem is, the individual worlds don't feel particularly engaging.  I think there are a couple of reasons for this.  First is that the theme in 504 is extremely thin.  The theme as presented in a couple of paragraphs in the rulebook and within the book of worlds is very generic, and I didn't end up even reading the world description until after playing.  Even if I had read it before, I don't imagine it would have made a difference.  The game feels exceptionally mechanical and abstract, and I am just not a fan of purely abstract games.

Now, I'm the first to admit to loving extremely dry Euro games with pasted on themes.  The Castles of Burgundy is among my favorite games ever, and it's theme is extremely thin, but its mechanisms work extremely well together and form a coherent system that makes sense within its theme, which brings me to the second reason why I didn't find 504 to be engaging.

504 is a complex system, but each individual game (at least those I played) ends up being rather simple.  The rules for each module are somewhat complex to address the use of that module in each of the three available slots, but the rules for each module in a single slot are fairly simple.  So once you figure out how a particular world works, the world ends up being not particularly deep.  The game does not have complex decisions and quickly came to feel repetitive.  There were not multiple strategies to pursue or multiple paths to victory.  Everyone was simply trying to reach the same goal by being slightly more efficient than everyone else.  The randomness in the outcomes of the exploration module overwhelmed any advantages a player could get by playing more efficiently than the other players, and those efficiencies seemed to come more from gaming the rules system than having an actual long-term strategy.

Another issue with the 504 system is the feeling of disconnect between the various modules.  In some cases, like world 521, you might get a combination of point generation and economy that are very synergistic, which can lead to the snowballing effect I experienced in that game.  In world 512, the point generation and economy did not synergize, nor did they work at counter purposes.  Instead, they felt completely disconnected.  It felt like playing two different games on the same board, where your success in one simply helped to drive your success in the other.  There weren't interesting decisions to make because the two parts were completely independent of each other.

This is, of course, a necessity for accomplishing a modular system like 504.  Since each module has to work with the others, each module has to be mostly self-contained.  Many board game expansions are modular in nature, but they do not have a feeling of disconnect that 504 has.  That is because those expansions are built on the foundation of a cohesive game.  504 has a foundation of rules that apply to all of its modules, but they do not form a game of their own.  This results in the modules not meshing particularly well together.

I admire 504 for its ambition and its design, but the result does not make for an interesting game.  The game worlds feel overly simplistic and abstract, which I think is required to make something like this work.  I don't see how this game could have been made differently to overcome these issues without drastically increasing the learning curve and rules density of each individual game.  I think 504 could best serve as an educational tool for aspiring designers.  It demonstrates a wide variety of common Euro game design elements, and a would-be designer could use the various worlds of 504 as a jumping-off point for creating their own designs.

Having only played this once, it's impossible to tell whether all games were as mediocre as the one I played but I think this is more an interesting experiment rather than a really enjoyable gaming experience. I certainly wouldn't turn down further plays to see some of the other elements but these aren't the games I was hoping for.

Life is full of extremes (if you're lucky). And sometimes the difference between awesome and terrible can be tiny. Like spinach on your pizza (awesome). Like women wearing culottes this summer (again, awesome). Like chocolate ice cream in cold coffee (disgusting). And while I bow my head in deep respect to the mad and impressive intellect that dared to take board game concepts and iterated through all possible combinations (not variations, not permutations, get your stats straight, man!), the result leaves me in horror at the sight of the monster this has spawned. Why would anyone ever be willing to bother with the overwhelming mass of lifeless rules just for the sake of an abstract combinatorical idea? 

504 was sooo close to beeing the ultimate game of games, being brilliantly impressive by its sheer meta-ness. But it went past this tiny perfect spot and, with a tear in my eye, I realize that just being meta alone is ... not ... enough. My world just got a bit darker today :-(

What a terrific concept.  FF has really outdone himself.  I'm not sure if any of these combinations will be a knockout game, but he certainly gets points for being clever and ambitious.

I feel funny rating this game yet, after just scratching the surface of the design.  The start game was just okay.  I really hope there is more to this system.

Friedemann Friese conducted a gaming experiment and (for the most part) it succeeded.  Such an interesting concept!  Does not always work well, but the mere fact that he was able to cobble together such a Frankenstein's monster of a game is amazing!

Cons:  Inherent rules fiddliness.  It's inescapable but mildly annoying.  Very easy to miss a critical rule or bit of minutiae.  While a successful experiment, it will not always yield a successful game.  Also endemic to the structure, and unavoidable, but annoying.

Overall, I rather like this one.  It's just so fascinating to see the monster come to life!  So very clever and workable.  Well done!

First outing and we wanted to play a game.  Not to spend all night reading a rules book.  So we started as suggested with game 123.  The game was engaging enough, but not on its own anything new (6.5-7).  Not that I am expecting to uncover anything innovative mechanics wise as 504 is more about matching existing mechanics in different ways.  So as to maintain the same tile layout we then played 135.  The mechanics again worked fine and there seemed genuinely different strategies of road or movement enhancement, or a mix.  I was left with the impression that there are 502 more games that are likely to work as well in a similar way.

I was a little over awed and very impressed at the ingenious of 504 and the effort that must have gone into its creation.  I note Friedmann next to his 10 rating above mentions 3.5 years work.  That does not surprise me.  I doubt that this concept will ever be repeated or surpassed and in itself has bought something new and innovative into boardgaming.  To the extent that it is wanted or needed I am not certain.

There are twenty or so other Spiel ’15 in my pile games waiting to be played.  I suspect 123 and 135 will on their own be better than many of them.  But what I am really hoping for from my new games is something individually more fine-tuned, for example La Granja (strictly 2014) or Nippon, to name two from the pile I have already played.  I suspect that both of these single games on their own received at least a couple of year’s development and fine tuning, whereas in 504 any individual game could only have received a cursory number of plays in a 42 month period.  Having said that, the various systems were obviously tested several times with the various different other systems, so that may in itself prove to have been sufficient for solid game play, which so far from my very small sample seems to be the case.

I am struggling to know how to rate 504.  I’ve decided on an 8, not because I think many of the individual games will warrant that, but because the overall endeavour, idea and effort requires a reward and a premium on the rating.  That is a first for me.  But hopefully now Friedmann and Henning have got 504 out of their system, they will spend as much time devoted to a single game next time and produce their next Power Grid or Fresh Fish.

504 is a Great idea, but very hard to get right. The rule book mention if a 1008 page book is not possible, but that seems to me the best way. Very hard to get all the rules right. But maybe my opinion becomes too fast because I've only played 123.

Had a false start with module 123. (score 5) : the starting player has a very big advantage because the field is open. The upgrades are too cheap so everyone can upgrade every round. But at this moment I give one more point more because of the great concept; I really wish that a truely gem is among the 504.

Second play with 738 : a lot better than 123 but again I had a feeling that this game would have been a lot better as a stand alone game with adjusted rules. (score 6) Now again I had the idea that the game could have been better.

The temptation to lower the rating aside, this is more than just a game, it is a game system with multiple ways to put everything together to make so many games.

A fantastic technical and ludotorical (not really a word) accomplishment.

I found my one play of 583 very interesting.  I'd love to explore this game more, but the rules overhead is absolutely crippling.  There are so many little rules and exceptions, you have to babysit every player on every turn.  I'd love to be able to play this regularly with 2 or 3 other experienced players, but it will never happen.  The rules overhead is far too great for the weight of the games.

I am very intrigued by this game. The idea of having hundreds of different games in one box is interesting.

So far, I have played five games (Worlds 123, 456, 789, 234, and 567, in this order). I would say that the difference between the worlds is quite relative. It's like a deck of cards; you can play many different games with it but if you prefer dice games and don't like card games, you shouldn't expect much from the deck of cards. 

Similarly, as all the games in 504 share the same set of components (although only some of them are used in each game) and some basic rules, the playable games can't be totally different. And by that I mean that the games are mechanically quite the same: you always have a map constructed from tiles (the initial layout may be different), pieces that move on the map by same rules (possibly with more options or variations), and paper money. There are no card games, no dice games (there are cards and dice), no hidden role games, no trivia games, no co-operation (I assume) etc.

In conclusion, this is not a game that replaces a whole game collection (at least not for me), since it doesn't cover all genres and mechanics, but it is a good candidate to take with on a trip. On the other hand, I don't mind playing the same game over and over - I don't like to learn new rules that much - I'd rather stick to the games I know I like. However, so far I have had to read the rules at least for an hour before I get to play a new world of 504...

The rating scale of Boardgamegeek is not sufficient for this game, since I definitely want to play this game and won't expect it to change any time soon, but a single world would get a maximum rating of 8, so far.

World ratings:
123: 8
125: 7
234: 6.5
345: 7
456: 5.5

Initial impressions:

Module played: 376.  Neat idea, poor execution.

Base game is boring, modules are supposed to add spice and flavor but seem to often combine in ways which can easily make the game broken by whomever takes advantage of the broken aspect best.  The road module being third added precisely zero interesting bits to the other modules; I suspect this will not be uncommon.

Might play once more just to verify, rating likely to drop to a 2-3, no more than a 5.

We played 8-7-2 where residents were building trading houses and trying to gain different goods or multiples of the same good for a bonus. It seemed to work mostly fine and also felt pretty uninspired. At a few points during our play, it seemed like players could be totally shut out of the rest of the game. I appreciate what Friese is trying to do here, but I'm not sure that it's worth playing. While I'm not someone who requires great theme, I like it and this game has practically none. For the sake of seeing if the games work or not, I might try it again. I won't feel like I missed much if I don't try it again.

Very interesting design where I only have had the chance to play game 1-2-3. I must say that the exciting part of this game is to explore the different games and get the chance to play new games all the time, which is something I like. The problem is that the individual games is probably never as good as a game designed to play in a specific way.

The contents of the box is fascinating but I can't help but imagine that every game I'll feel like I'm play-testing a theme-less design.  Beautiful components can't obscure the delight-free nature of tacking game mechanics together. For me, it's cumbersome to follow the spirit of the design and always learn a new game. That said, there are bound to be many fun iterations if you have the time and tenacity to discover them. PLUS, it's a heck of a box of components for playing with your own game designs.

Hard to comment as there are too many combinations to make broad generalizations. I love the concept, though, and think Friese is brilliant. Will post short remarks about each different combo I play:

163 - An interesting pick-up and deliver module with roads that felt like a very light, fast Roads & Boats. I didn't like the privileges, as they didn't seem very balanced, and added a "lucky draw" swinginess to what was otherwise a nice, pure-information Euro. I may not play with Privileges again (at least not in third position).

The game we played (564 -explore/roads/war - where the first element determines how you win the game, the second how you generate income and the third adds some extra flavour) was fine, if lacking that spark which illuminates the best of games, but there's no doubt that the design is an  intellectually phenomenal accomplishment ... that an essentially random selection of nine different design elements works and works well is an astonishing achievement ... and the rules even manage to be clearer and more coherent than many other examples we've come across. Chapeau!

Just a quick comment on player count: 2p is OK but it doesn't really show off the game in most configurations. It's really a much superior game with 3 or 4 players; 4 is ideal, although many configurations work just as well with 3.
---
Some more thoughts on module interactions: I like Privliges, but if you put it in 1 or 2 it adds an auction, which does add significant time. Which is fine, it also makes the game more interesting and deeper, but you just need to be aware. Also, Privliges and Industry have a slightly odd rules interaction if they're both in the top 2 (the Privlige module introduces a Factory mechanic to drive scoring when it's in I or II, which can be confusing in combination with the plants you're building for the Industry module).

Explore also makes for a longer game if it's in the III spot. Exploring will cost you Residents (money) without giving you a payoff in economy or VPs. Which is again fine on its own, but when combined with another module that adds length in the top two (like Privliges or Stocks) you start turning it into a meatier, longer game. I like the flavor of explore, so it's fine with me, but again, tastes vary.

I like Military (4), but you have to know what you're getting into - plenty of people who would be up for 504 in general are not going to enjoy the experience with Military. I think Military works best with a fast, relatively generous economic engine and you don't want to include anything else which is going to be a major drain on Residents. I think 456 works pretty well, and other combinations that seem promising include Race (any slot), Privileges (probably in III), Shares (any slot, surprisingly), and Production (in II, maybe I). Military in III has some interesting possibilities but seems like a straight-up screw-your-neighbor situation so know that's what you want.

I haven't generally been that impressed by Production, especially in III. It's obviously good in combination with Pick Up and Deliver, and in I or II it can work as an easy module to play & learn (and it has some attractive combinations with Shares because of it's relative simplicity). But I'd think twice about including it in III in most situations.

Here are the worlds I've played:
123: Fast, fun lighter game which is a nice intro and totally solid. Better with 3 or 4. Played twice.
173: Solid but the modules don't have a ton of nice synergy in this configuration. The Majorities in II are pretty simple, and the residents don't have a ton to do here, so you get a lot of surplus cash buying a lot of residents just because you can. The Privileges also aren't super-interesting for the same reasons, except for the ones that upgrade your Trolley. I do really like the Pick up and Deliver module, I think it's really solid in a lot of combinations, but I'd pair it up with other stuff. I think just swapping the positions of 1 and 7 to make it 713 might actually be a lot more interesting.
263: Fast (under an hour), really solid. If you want a shorter game, include Race in I or II.
456: Solid and reasonably fast 4x-style game; we played it in an hour, but 1-2hr is probably a safe bet. The Roads give it a bit of a Roman-era vibe
468: This is the only one I've played that I personally found interesting but would not recommend to others unless you're a real 504 geek. Production in III introduces a limit on building residents which is problematic in combination with Military, in this case making it too hard to drive the game to a conclusion. I think with sharp Military players it'll be a little too long, but it has the potential to run way, way too long with non-wargamers because the production limit makes it time-consuming to build up your economy. I think 46x is fine, but use 2 (Race), 3 (Privileges), or even 7 (Majorities) or 9 (Shares).
568: Has a Roads & Boats zen, takes a little bit longer because the Explore endgame takes a bit of time, but keep your eyes on the VPs. Also be clear on the way VPs are scored, the rules say everything but take a little bit of close parsing.
586: Obviously, somewhat similar to 568, but the resident dynamics are quite different. The big decision is whether or not to invest in a road network, since that's in III now so not mandatory (in 568, building plants *is* mandatory to increase your ability to build residents). Strategies and trade-offs are different but not radically so. Felt solid and fun but I'd mix it up with a different III module before playing it again.
653: Another fast-playing one, totally solid empire-building feel.
657: I seem to be using 5 and 6 a lot; they're good modules. This is another solid entry; 7 worked quite well in the III spot, sort of surprisingly to me (7 is the module I'm the most skeptical of generally, possibly undeservedly - I do definitely want to try it in I, where it really changes things up). Anyway, this was solid; I like the x57 combo, so I might try it with 1 or 8 in I.
724: This was actually really fun, although the endgame scoring is pretty swingy due to the military option. But if you put Military into the mix, you know you’re going to get something a bit crazy. I think this might work with a slightly more traditional II module like production or roads; the high variability in income levels slightly exacerbated the uneven turns. But regardless, this was really fun to play and I’d recommend it. You could swap privliges or shares into III for interesting variations, or to season to taste.
835: With both Explore in the III spot and the privilege auctions this can run a touch long. The interactions of 3 & 8 in the top I & II are a little bit confusing because of the Plants (for 8) and Factories (for 3) which use the same pieces and similar language but serve different purposes. It's not terrible but you need to be clear on it. For me personally Explore in III can make things run a little longer than I like, but if Explore adds value for you, you may feel differently.

I'd like to revisit the 1 & 2 modules now for a bit, which strike me now as having more potential than I would have guessed. Also, having just read the rules again for 7 (Majorities) seems significantly more interesting than I first intuited and seems like it'll combine interestingly. Also keen to try a few oddball combinations, like Military and Stocks in the Top I & II.

Anyway, there are challenges to 504; for the first 5 or so games I played, there were more minor rules troubles than I would have liked. None of it was more than minor, but in every case the game would have been better played correctly. Nobody likes sitting around for rules explanations, so I always feel some pressure to get through them and get into the play quickly, but in the case of 504 it's obviously more important to get the rules right up-front and it's rarely that hard to do it; you just need to have the extra discipline to nail everything down before getting stated. None of the combinations are difficult to learn - in fact they're all pretty easy - so just do it. 504 is game of exploration and experimentation, you can enjoy the combinations without any expectation of playing them again, so there is obviously a premium on getting them right the first time.
---
I tend to like the modules that inject a little randomness - Exploration mainly, but also Privileges and Military (addenda: I didn't realize Majorities had some interesting uncertainty; now I'm more interested in that too ... [remainder of comment eaten by BGG emoji bug. May reconstruct later.]

Hmm, how to rate this one...

After one play, it's pretty much impossible to rate based on a "I love the game play" basis, as I've played one out of 504 distinct games, and when I say distinct, I mean distinct.  Depending on the rules you decide to play with, you can be playing games as different as a stock-holding operations game like 18XX vs. an exploration area-majority game like Tikal vs. a war conquest game like Antike.

However, I did really enjoy my play of the game, and I can confidently say I really want to play more to explore everything that was created here.  It's very likely that I'll like some of the games and not like others, but it's the fun of picking three mechanisms and seeing how 504 mashes them together into an actual playable game of good quality that is the real draw here.

Brilliant concept.  The point of the game is to engage the meta elements and embark on a journey of discovery.  The strength of the individual games is secondary and perhaps even incidental to the main process.

I have found from my limited experience that the individual games are decent to pretty good, nothing quite spectacular that you'd want to play endlessly.  I don't think that's the point of this design though.

Rating of the modules:

123: 4.  Seems like the first player has some advantage. Also set-up is a little to long for the playtime.

132: 6.  A little more interesting than 123 but still over to quickly for my taste.

483: 3 (but 8 for 48X).  Maybe a little to long (took us over 2 hours). This also made me realize that I'll probably never will play any XX3 again, because the privileges are not balanced enough for "instant-buy". Auctioning them seems fine.
But 48X is a very nice combination, that I'm looking forward to try again. Might be improved by house-ruling the end-condition (7 tiles undiscovered). Maybe finish the last round when someone reaches ~50 points?

This game can be anything you want it to be! How cool is that?! Do you want to discover the world? Race your opponents or dominate the world you're in? Or all of the above at once? Everything is possible here!
If you do not like a specific mechanism too much, then you can skip the worlds that contain it - you'd still have 336 worlds to explore!

Have to give this a solid 8, +1 for countering people who really do not understand the strength behind this modular system. Once you get your head wrapped around the different modules, it becomes easier to put all the pieces of the puzzle together into one of the many games, even before you play. That way you can get an idea how this might work out and whether it sounds interesting to you or not - making you able to avoid worlds that sound dull to you! Which game can do that?
Gaming experiences vary from great (486, 498, 687)via stable (817, 538, 685) to mediocre (123, 456), so a rating for the actual experience is really difficult. Some modules work pretty well together, some are just a bad team.

A big majority of the worlds I've seen so far are at least 'solid' and make me want to play them again to refine the strategy.

Mostly the setup took a lot of time, so you're well advised to have your game components stored in some way other than plastic bags!

One of the most innovative titles to hit the market in years, 504 is not just a game or a game system, but a mix-and-match suite of game systems that can be customized to your tastes.  Unlikely to directly replace any game in your collection, it nevertheless gives you the ability to experiment with different set ups and appreciate the subtle differences between approaches commonly used in games.

Oh wow. First Copycat, then this. FF is getting way too meta and I'm loving it.

10 for concept, 8 for execution. The rulebook is a bit unwieldy and there are some kinks to be ironed out, but I trust everything will work out in the end.

Games:

123: Nice, simple introduction. I'd give it a 7, not terribly thrilling but short, to the point, and does what it's supposed to. You can really mess your opponents if you feel like it with your settlements.

456: The exploring rules are simpler than they appear at first, and the trade-off between building a network and exploring makes for a pretty interesting game.

Original thoughts: Fascinating design. More special-cases than I'd like, but given the superstructure they may be inevitable (and really do help the modules mesh together smoothly).

Learning the game for our first play (516) was trickier than I've found most board games to be: partly due to the need to learn the base-game then overlay several modules, but also partly due to some oddities & errors in translation.

My ratings below of "If this were a standalone game..." should be taken with a grain of salt; I'd judge a standalone game more harshly for not fine-tuning certain things which would only have added more special exception-cases in a game of this nature.

[b]After 3 games:[/b] I'm finding myself not really wanting to pull it out again. It's a combination of "just thinking about hashing out the rules to a new combination makes me tired" (ie, the rules-overhead issue isn't getting easier fast enough - too many exception cases and differences based on module position) and "the game always feels very similar" - despite very strong mechanical differences between modules, the sameness in components, certain core mechanics, and game arc makes the experience feel more same-y than I'd prefer for this level of time investment.

*** SPECIFIC WORLDS*** 

516 (3p): Fun dynamics, especially for 1.II / 6.III / the two together. 5.I worked OK but wasn't great - interaction with 1.II was interesting but also made finding the first (fish) city pretty swingy (4p would have been better, due to all 5 goods already being out), and it felt like a fair amount of the scoring was on rails. Not literally, but just due to opportunity cost / geography, even with road networks. (Our end scores were [i]extremely[/i] close despite different approaches to play.) Were this a standalone game, I'd be strongly praising the pickup-and-delivery, moderately praising the road-building, and mildly disappointed with the mechanism for victory; I'd rate it a 5. (But I have hope that a different first module would add substantial interest.)

872 (3p): ...meh? One player commented it felt more like a puzzle than a game, and there was something to that. Also, the majorities income (7.II) stacked with the first-to-3 bonus points (2.III on 8.I) in a way that amplified how good it was to be first to 3 for a terrain / goods type and how terrible it was to compete and miss; the game was probably decided by the halfway mark if not earlier. The first-to bonuses resulted in strongly differentiated scoring; the sets-of-goods were all very close due to the ability to swap 2-for-1. Each of the modules looked like they could be really interesting in other contexts, but not this one. If it were standalone, I'd rate it a 3-4.

942 (3p): The first game of 504 I felt like I might want to replay verbatim. I tried this one based on forum suggestions (most notably, using an "in a hurry" module for position III, without which it takes the companies over half the game just start interacting at all). 9.I generally worked fine, though the inability to own more than 50% of the shares was weird, and meant that tanking the "100% in player hands" stock bonus was pretty easy. I liked the dynamics of 4.II more than I was expecting to - the combat system was really simple, but did a nice job: terrain mattered, offense was encouraged, and with "in a hurry" residents you could make big pushes and changes in direction. (One stock company was a little incautious and got obliterated.) 2.III worked fine, though the fact that the bonus escalated rather than diminished was a little weird. Would probably rate a 6 as a standalone game, but it took quite a while.

RATING: 10
With 504 different games, this is the one when you're trapped on a desert island or can otherwise only bring one game somewhere where you will sit on your arse in boredom for six months+. The design that laces this together is very innovative but probably a bit intimidating to casual gamers. It took me several hours just to devise an organizational system for the components. This complexity is likely the reason that this game hasn't won many awards despite being, in my opinion, the most innovative concept of any game ever released. I'm glad I bought this game while I did because due to the general hesitation toward it's complexity its sales probably arent doing well and it may not ever see a second printing.

I had big expectations for this game and bought it right when it came out. But I found that for every combination you pick, there's likely another game which goes into the same direction but does it better. Fortunately I managed to sell it with just a small loss. :-P

If I were to live the rest of my life just playing one game, this might be my pick as it opens a multiverse of game types, but fortunately I can afford to store several games in my cabinets and therefore have one or more really great games in each of my preferred game types where 504 (almost by design) can only offer a mediocre game.

Essentially a compendium of 504 different games, created by assembling any three of nine included modules together to create an individual game.  The position of the module in the game affects either victory conditions, player income, or flavour rules.  I've played five or so games of this with four different modules in various positions, and can conclude the package is a stunning achievement in design.  The only down side is the rules entry cost is forbidding, but once you crack it, it rapidly becomes much less complex.

Anybody interested in game design should take a look at this.  The components are superbly done.

I would like the concept. It works ok. The individual game segments can combine to form simple games. 

The games seem to be fairly quick yet uninteresting games. To be fair, the game wants you to never really replay any games, so each is kind of disposable. Not that you would want to replay any of the games. 

The biggest issue is each game (so far) has a singular dominate point source that overwhelms the other one and makes the game fairly derivative.

I don't think its 504 different games.  more 1 game with 504 variants.  The more you play it the more it makes sense and you get your head round how it all fits together.  the joy of the game is then looking at the mechanics you have in play and how to win with them.

I doubt very much that any game inside 504 is a 10, and I'd bet there are very few 8's, but I'm giving 504 an 8, because the actual playing of a game that morphs every time you play it is fun for someone like me who likes trying new games. I just played 467, will never play it again, but can't wait until I get to see what 746 is. Or any of the others. The experience of learning a game, playing once to play well, then moving on, works very well. It's interesting, and I am looking forward to more plays.

Die abstrakte Darstellung des Prinzips Eurogame als Skelett ohne Fleisch. Eine modulare Versuchsanordnung als Reduktion auf Mechanismen. Es mag dabei satirisch die Beliebigkeit von Eurogames entlarven, entlarvt sich damit natürlich aber selbst als austauschbar. Ein Experiment im Spielelabor, das man bestaunen kann: alle Eurogames in einer Schachtel. 504 ist ein mathematischer Entwurf am Reißbrett wie ein Abenteuerspielplatz im Wald ohne Wald. Respekt vor der Leistung und harten Arbeit, eine Diplomarbeit über Eurogames zu schreiben, denn das ist 504: eine Diplomarbeit. Dr. Knizia bekommt promovierte Konkurrenz. Aber Spielkinder interessieren sich nicht für Nobelpreise. Sie rutschen lieber als Long John Silver die Rutsche hinab und entern das Schiff der dummen Spanier, hinein in die Regenpfütze am Ende der Rutsche und brüllen dabei laut: "Attacke!" Meine Note bezieht sich auf das Startmodul 123, das sich rechenschieberhaft und leblos anfühlte und bei mir den Verdacht hervorruft, dass sich 503 weitere blutarme Abstraktionen in der Schachtel stauen. Ich mag sie ich gar nicht mehr ausprobieren. Aber das Regelringbuch hat mich beeindruckt.

My thoughts...

* Too much of a starting player advantage.  It's pretty monstrous in most setups.  Many setups have some sort of handicapping based on player order, but the imbalance is pretty striking.  Recommend a start player auction.

* Too hard to come back.  In a game like this, most setups will be brand new to most players.  As such, every game is a 'learning game'.  For other games, no problem.  You learn and know how to play better next time.  For a game like this, every learning game needs to be fun because you may never play it again.  When you make a mistake early you need to have a way to take a chance to make it back into the game.  You need to be able to gang up on the leader if someone makes a great early play no one else caught.  Otherwise, too many players are out of the game too early and that just isn't fun.  

* Strikingly short games.  So far, games are 3-5 turns per player.  That's it.  Maybe there will be some combination that runs considerably longer.

I'm hopeful that a handful of games will stand out as games to re-play over and over.  I initially thought of this as a 'play every variety once' game, but I'm less inclined to think of it that way after the first handful of games.

===
123: 6.  Watched the PBF.  Looks interesting enough.  No wow factor, but that's how most euros are for me.  Average Euro.  I like playing Euros, but most of them don't leave me asking to play again.  Same thing I got from watching this game.  Simple, though, so probably a good starter game.

456: 6.5  Played a PBF.  Interesting game.  I think there's probably a dominant strategy here, but it does require this exact 456 game... move the modules around or swap one out and the strategy doesn't work.

375: 4.  Played a PBF.  Majorities economy + Exploration is a very bad combination.  Rich get richer.

738: 9.  Really good game.  I'd play it again.

621: 7.5.  

My rating is higher than the average of the individual ratings for a couple reasons... playing the new combination is fun in itself even if I don't want to replay some of them.  (And I do want to play the game.)  Plus I like several of the modules... I don't think I've hit my favorite combinations of modules yet.

All the mechanics of your favorite games with zero, and I mean, zero theme. Reading and interpreting the rules for each "game" is like reading a math textbook, and there is nothing to help you reason about how the game should work other than memorizing abstract rules. The coding in the rulebook is ridiculously confusing and largely unexplained.

It's unfortunate, because 504 should absolutely be recognized as a tour de force of game design (or at least a certain kind of game design) and that's why I'll give it a 9/10. If I rated it according to my preferences, however, I'd rate it 4/10. I personally think a game is more than just the math--it's also supposed to be fun, and from the first moment engaging with 504, it just isn't.

It's remarkable that Mr. Friese was able to put this together, and I have can't imagine how long or how much intellectual effort it took. But this game is recommended only for fans of the most abstract games.

I am indeed amazed at 504, but I expect this is my last Friedmann Friese game--the guy is, with all due respect, a toaster.

Played 936 with 4 pl. = 18xx meets Settlers of Catan (without Resources). Mediocre experience.  This Game would need an app  that shows based on the chosen modules which phases in which order We have go through. We constantly looked up rules and phases description in the rule book, but sometimes it is written in the main rulebook and sometimes in the modulebook, so a lot of search was necessary to get first game rolling due to the sandbox concept of 504.

Only played twice so far, but I get the gist.  The combinations aspect is neat, and the two games I played were very different from each other.  I can see how maybe some combinations might not mesh well, or at least not make for the most enjoyable/working gameplay.  This,however, does not give me enough incentive to trash its reputation.  With 504 combinations, you think maybe you could find the rules you like best and among those, find at least 5 or six worlds that you really enjoy?  I think so.  Some people who have rated this very low probably did this:

-Tried maybe 3 combinations at most; found the beginning learning of the game rules tedious; had a poor experience with their first play-throughs as they didn't do very well compared to other players (but felt they were playing really well); and couldn't get over the fact the game wasn't as strategic or nuanced as they thought the learning of the rules led them to believe it would be.. So obviously rate the game terrible.

Here's the way I see it.  It does involve reading the rules well before the first game and each combination of worlds you play.  I does involve playing several times before really getting a grasp on what the world's requiring of you to do well.  The games can take a while or be light and easy to play.  Kids and adults alike can find the game fun and some combinations better suited for either crowd.  The modular design and rule-blending lends to a multitude of experiences, which some might well be more enjoyable than others.  I tend to think that the discovery of what works well and what doesn't is fun in itself.  Let's say you try world combo 469 and you hate it... Well remember that 469 is terrible and don't play it again.  Of you find that you likes 2 of the 3 rules but the other was not to your liking, and then steer clear of that number.. It's easy, since you'll still have hundreds of minutely similar/dissimilar worlds to choose from.  

There is also a boat that has no purpose at all in any of the 9 rules (Used in 0% of worlds, as stated in the rule book), which I totally enjoyed making up rules for one of the games I played.  This game basically lets you find ways to play it as much to your liking as your preferences direct it.

If you were looking for another Powergrid from Friese, you were probably really upset about that..  It's not anything like Powergrid (well, most of the time...)

I appreciate the idea, however my game was very boring. We played 6 rounds, the game lasted 2 hours and after your turn you had to wait for approx. 15 minutes. The decisions were not tough, however many rules exist. A lot of pushing around of meeples and administrative thinges to do.

RATING: 7.25
More a system than a game. 504 is a monumental thought experiment, an act of hubris, an ingenious arrangement which combines multiple sets of tokens and rules to recreate many popular game engines with one box, albeit a large one.

If you find yourself intrigued, entertained and amazed at Friese's genius in other games, then this may be just your ticket.

I have to admit it took a while to focus and get that 1st play in, but even with the base game, 123, I found it a fascinating meta-game, thinking about the game as I played it.

Starting this box o'goodness at 7.25, with room to expand upwards if needed.

One has to admire the challenge FF set and met here, even if you don't like all the games (and admittedly I do not expect to like them all).

(12/05/2015) Comment based on one play.

Innovative concept of a mechanism-morphic game, where a "game world" is uniquely described by a three-digit number (with no repeat of the same digit), ranging from 123 to 789, for 504 different games.

Here, the designer of Power Grid has taken on something big, trying to create a game system where it is possible to play a large range of games from a fixed set of game bits and components. There are nine different rule sets, each a unique game mechanism, such as a "race" or "stock market" or "warfare". Put three of them together, and viola! you have a Frankenstein-esque creation of a game. Whether a particular game world is good or not remains to be seen.

My concerns about this approach from early one were that in order to make such a concept to work, the nine rule sets needed to be relatively benign, self-contained, and simple. It is impressive that the designer was able to pull this off, and the resulting rule sets is rather comprehensive. The rules and game mechanisms themselves are not that difficult to understand. However, the description of the infrastructure that allows rule sets to be swapped in-and-out is quite complex and easy to get confused. Integrating three rule sets into one game world may be the equivalent of learning a new game. However, if one becomes familiar with all nine rule sets, then it is a matter of deciding which three of the nine to play, determine what the exceptions are, and then play.

Still, there are a LOT of bits and components, such that is feels more like a game prototyping kit than a game system. Punch out and sorting took over an hour, and then another 30 minutes trying to set up the first game world. Sigh.

In the end, after playing the introductory game of World "123", which was a simple pick-up-and-deliver over a geomorphic board, the result was underwhelming. There was no sense of urgency to play this again, even though it took over an hour to set up. I give it high marks for innovation, risk-taking, and rules execution--it hangs together beautifully, although so fragile to the point of breaking apart. However, the gameplay is decidedly meh. Well, there are 503 more worlds to explore, but not sure if I have the patience to work through and find those rule combinations that I find challenging and interesting, but that doesn't seem to be the point. It seems that the novelty will be in the "exploring" of these alternate game worlds and not in examining the game system too deeply itself. Unfortunately, I am not in that audience. The game is ground breaking in terms of scope and design, and in of itself is a "10". But, if I am rating this for my desire to play it again, the initial rating is: "7". I am willing to play this a few more times, but I am not hopeful of finding something exciting in it.

The level of creativity of designing this game is amazing.

Probably the most experimental (commercial )game I've ever seen. 

Each game itself is merely OK. But the fun of this game is at another layer: creating your own game and finding out the result. Due to the complexity of the rule, it's pretty something weird enough to be enjoyed only by geeks.

It's kind of out of scope, thus very hard to rate.

This is an ambitious and interesting idea, but unfortunately it's a very uninteresting game. Based on the rules it seems like the 504 different games would all actually end up fairly similar, and seemingly fairly shallow. Honestly, I don't know if I could have seen it go any other way; I think if you make a game this modular it's going to have to be extremely generic to have any chance of working.

I've tried to play this game twice now using different setups, and both times we abandoned after realising that the game just wasn't that interesting. Since then I've read the rest of the rulebook and I have come to the conclusion that it's just a box of mediocre games, if there is a gem in there I have no interest in hunting for it.

The only thing interesting/unique about this game is the mechanism for choosing the rules, unfortunately the modules which make up the rules are nothing to write home about on their own.

The setup time is relatively long compared to game length (especially if you havn't played that module combination before), and it's just not worth it.

World 243: "Fast" game. Over in 3 turns. Everything ended in a sudden fast burst of saying "hello" to cities (don't need to having controlled a city for it to count towards victory, just having entered is enough). Anti-climatic and felt broken.

World 942: Slooow game. Very fiddly with a lot of time spent on managing the money aspect (very annoying that there is to little money in the bank, so we had to exchange notes between outselves *all* the time). Mechanics however seem good and well integrated. A deep game that isn't deciphered in one go.

I rate this as a 10, not because I think any individual world is a top tier design, but because it is so much fun to tinker with the permutations of modules and see what arises. While individual worlds have their rough edges, it is amazing how all of the modules fit together and most of the worlds end up being fun. I would probably be slightly less enthusiastic if I didn't own the game and a friend brought it to the table. A large part of the fun for me takes place in between sessions studying the game and seeing how everything fits together.

I have read many reviews on this game and the ratings have ranged from '4' to '10' depending on the combination of the ruleset.

What I've given my initial rating is for the concept, not necessarily the actual game play.  I've only run through a few of the early numbered set-ups and there was only one that I actually wanted to play again right away.  That one set-up alone could have been published as a separate game.  Five down... 499 to go.

i need to applaude the design and how it was possible but i have some huge issues with this game . 

- this game is completly souless. i know we play euros for the mechanisms but cmon this is a joke. its like everygame is made from a development kit just to test the mechanisms. 

- this game takes FOREVER to setup and takedown because you need to learn the rules EVERYTIME you sitdown to play. For me this breaks any wish i had of playing again. ..  Every other game ever made the more you play it the setup is faster and faster. 

the biggest point i could make is 
I would rather pay 100$ for a fantastic game or 2 , than 504 mediocre ones.

[floatleft][ImageID=2570515][/floatleft]This was by far the most disappointing game that I played from Essen 2015. However, before I get to that I want to say how remarkable a design achievement 504 represents. I can imagine having the thought to make interchangeable game modules, and encoding them into a flip book, but I would not have imagined actually creating the game. The immense amount of work and thought that must have gone into creating 504 is staggering. Even if I ultimately dislike the game play that this crazy project offers I am still in awe of Friedemann for making it a reality. 

We played the 123 game which is the combination recommended in the rulebook for an introductory game. In this game you must deliver goods to cities, you get VPs for delivering many of the same good and also for delivering each different good. You start with a wagon that can hold one good and has 4 movement (I think). By visiting new cities and delivering goods you also make money which you can spend to increase the speed and capacity of your wagon. You can also buy tech cards that give you little advantages.

[center][ImageID=2732659 medium][/center]

The 123 game offers almost no decisions to the players at all, and many of the decisions that do exist are not interesting. You obviously need to upgrade your wagon at every opportunity, thus you also need to maximize your income every turn, thus you need to move to a new city each round (or more than one once you have some upgrades and tech cards) to make more money to buy more upgrades to visit more cities.... DULL!! It's true that such pithy descriptions can be written for any game, but the difference here is that the pithy description is a full account of the strategic options and depth the game has to offer :P 

It's worth noting that players interact only incidentally, someone might deliver a good to a city before you get the chance, but there is very little room to actually plan anything because the game is only 4 or 5 rounds long. It's a boring solitary exercise in spending dollars on movement points and movement points on VPs. If the 123 game were made into a standalone game I would expect it never to get published. I would rate the 123 game a 3 on the BGG scale. The reason I currently rate 504 a 5 is that the game system is so amazingly cool, of course it would be nice if it also created fun games. I have some hope that a different combination of modules will yield a better experience, but when the recommended game falls flat it can't be a good sign.

A hugely impressive framework, but it felt like an unwieldy piece of machinery in practice. Looks like the generated web ruleset might be the way to go until I get a feel for all the world types. The generated game was a bit bland, but working a game out from scratch while playing it is usually more enjoyable than replaying the same one a lot, so it's nice to have 504 of those on hand.

Interesting.  I am impressed with the scope of the game - a true game kit.  Best one yet, perhaps.  However, the first session was a bit rough.  I look forward to trying out more games.  We played the 1-2-3 intro game, and I felt the cards didn't work well at all with the rest of the game.  This may be a harbinger of future problems.  But for now I will hope for even better sessions ahead.

For now I will rate this a "6".  I expect my rating will either rise or fall.

123: Played with 3, fast and decent pick up and deliver game slightly unbalanced to the benefit of the first player.

359: Stock manipulation and expansion. Played with two, had a problem with runaway leader and stock market felt flat, BUT has the potential to be quite good with more players.

894: Increasing companies values based on production, with a side of armed conflict. Worst one so far, very hard to combine the rules right for 8.I and 9.II (4.III practically wasn't used). Played 3-players, just felt uninteresting, as the green company had the advantage  throughout. Also we probably did a lot of rules wrong.

Really have to give some credits for the designer for such an idea. But as a game (or many different games), it's full of compromises (which is understandable): 1)for every single game you play, you have to go through the big set of components so you find the right stuff. 2) there are smaller of bigger usability issues, with the components, because they have to work in many kind of situations. 3) Games feels more like a prototypes than actually streamlined final versions. 4) These games are mising the theme. 
So if you are asking from me, I would choose those more streamlined, for one purpose made games, where every single game component are designer for one purpose games INSTEAD of this proto-504 feel gamebox games.

I guess I should not even rate this game after 1 play but, well, I do tell my first impressions. Well... I wasn't that impressed. It did work fine, it was balanced, I did even win, but it just didn't make me say 'Wow, I... want to try the other rules as well!'. Well, I'm somewhat curious if things can get more interesting with other numbers, but... I don't know, I think set-up and set-off time is way too high for this experience, although I can imagine it gets faster with time. Also, for at least the first 20 plays or more, you need to learn new rules each time you play which is simply tiresome: I like variety but I like it if it comes from the game itself more than if it comes from playing different games all the time. And in games like Isle of Skye on the previous page, you only need to know what you get points for this time, which is was simpler and easier, and you can jump into playing way faster.
Otherwise, of course the game system is an impressive achievement but maybe it's better as an educational tool for aspiring designers than something to be played really lots of times. Then again, one play is probably not enough to decide.

This is a tough one to talk about, as 504 isn't so much a game but a game system. Talking about the one we played, 231, is only of marginal usefulness, but it's a starting point. 231 is a race game where you're trying to be the first to drive to various cities. You can build factories in the cities you've visited in order to earn money that you can use to bid on special power cards. There isn't a whole lot to game 231, but although I was the first to reach all 10 target cities I lost by one point because the winning player was able to buy VPs in the card auction. That's worth noting for later. Would I play 231 again? Eh, I wouldn't clamor for it. But that's not really the question.

The question isn't how good 231 is, but how good 504 is. On the surface it seems like something that's more to appreciate for the sheer scope of ambition than for what it actually produces. Like a Rube Goldberg device or intricate marble run, judging it solely on its end result -- moving a marble from point A to point B -- misses the entire purpose. The amazing thing about 504 isn't game 231 but that it was able to produce game 231. Game 231 worked. Three elements, chosen randomly, combined to create a game that made sense, had understandable rules, and even had strategy decisions, such as focusing on the auctions instead of trying to power ahead with speed. It's also interesting that Friese doesn't just go with the most vanilla applications of each element in order to make it work better; he takes these basic elements and adds some novelty to their use and they still seem to mesh pretty well. 

504 is a strange beast because while the games it produces seems like they're fairly light and short and not very exciting to hardcore gamers, the system itself and how well it works makes it a gamer's game. It's like watching a master chef make pop-tarts, and I have no idea what to think about that.

-----

Played again. This time world 671. This is feeling like "Prototype: The Board Game" in which you play a different almost-but-not-quite-there game each time. It's as though most of Kickstarter were contained in a single box. 

I won't say no to a game of this, but it's looking like there may be more novelty here than fun.

One has to admire the sheer audacity and innovation of the game design. It seems to be a deconstruction of the "euro" game genre as we are able to mix and match mechanics to create 504 distinct games. We played two of the modules on our first play through and they were both solid. But what excited me even more was how different they were. Unlimited replayability here. The rule books make this a heavy game, however, so beware if you do not like bible-sized rules!

This game has to be respected for its ambitious nature.  It is 9 different mechanisms combined into 3 combinations of rulesets that can generate 504 games.  I like the idea and I played the resource, race area control combo.  It was ok, but I found it a bit boring.  It was a bit like playing a prototype.  I like a lot of euros but the utter lack of theme made this a soulless exercise.  I don't think I would want to play this again.  

If I did play again, I would look at game combinations for ideas into new games.  As an idea engine it is a great thing but as a fun game it is not.

As this is more of a game system than a game, it is sort of hard to rate.  I have only played the recommended 123 so far (which I might rate a 6 or even less as a stand alone game), but it leaves me wanting to try out lots more, so I rate it highly for now.

RATING: 5.8
There was a lot of hype here for a while and I was cautiously optimistic. It seems to produce a lot of short mediocre games that can be tailored to fit specific interests. So in certain situations this could be a good game to offer. It is a pretty neat gimmick but overall that's mainly all it is.

RATING: N/A
I have only played the 123-scenario, because it has it's own concise section in the rules.
That game wasn't too exciting, so we wanted to try another combination that sounded more to our liking.
But we never got that far, because none of us can read the rules (disclaimer: I have read rules for all CGE-games and most games by Uwe, so I refuse to accept this as my problem).

Seriously though, if my happiness depended on it, I could make myself read the 504 rules, but it doesn't, so I can't.

When someone compiles 504 separate books, each written like any other rulebook for a eurogame, I'll come back and play it.
________________________________

But of course: I am extremely impressed with the ambition and the ideas in this game! As game design goes, this definitely points towards the holy grail, and I have the utmost respect for Friedemann Friese for trying this out - even if it may in fact be unplayable :-)

RATING: 6
The rule book is seriously flawed. The presentation of information is awkward and disjointed, with wording that isn't always clear at first or even second pass. The chaotic layout of The Book of Worlds burns my brain more than actually playing any of the worlds. Thank the gods for this website: http://504rules.github.io/#123

Also, the fact that in every world players take all available actions in one turn makes for a LOT of downtime, especially with more players.

123 (2p): Just okay, but I don't find Pick-Up-and-Deliver to be an interesting mechanic. The Privileges were pretty cool. The Race module was just kinda there.

186 (2p): Either we played it wrong, or there aren't nearly enough resource tokens provided to cover both delivering goods as well as producing them for your own supply.

315 (2p): These modules worked pretty well together, however, either I played very badly, or there's a risk of a runaway leader. Even with taxes my wife kept the lead the entire game, had plenty of money for bidding on privileges, and more than doubled my score. It was ridiculous. Maybe we need to try this world again.

368 (2p): Another decent one. Actually felt more challenging than most of the worlds we've tried so far.

456 (2p): Not bad. The wife and I didn't really attack each other, and in the last couple rounds we saw how we really needed to in order to play this world at its best. The Exploration and Roads modules worked well together. Roads also clicked with Military since it allows you to move your armies around with ease.

456 (4p): Better than just 2p. The endgame is weird: If you trigger the end condition on your turn the game ends after your turn is done. This allows you to abandon all defenses and go on the offensive with everything, potentially swinging the points your way with ease.

518 (2p): One of the better worlds, imo, though the game was slightly overlong. The three modules worked well together in this configuration.

789 (2p): Not great. The Production module is fine, as is Majorities (once we figured out the turn order system), but Shares suck with 2p (as you might expect).

856 (2p): Just OK. We made a couple mistakes with rules, so we decided to start over. Money was the opposite of tight, so no challenge there. The fact that residents are "in a hurry" seemed to make the roads unnecessary: I built plenty, my wife hardly any, and she won handily.

872 (2p): Pretty good. The Race module made the game a little more competitive. This is the first world I feel like I'd actually like to play again.

Would need a bunch more plays to really know all that's in the box since it has so much variety.  I see this being great with a game group that could take time to explore each of the game sets and find out there own.  The rule book is a little cumbersome since it is made to be modular.

Played once, game 683. It was an okay game, but a bit abstract and bloodless, and it actually became less interesting towards the end, which is not a good thing. Also, I think we had too many pawns, to a point where I had to plan how to use 15 pawns the best way during a turn. 

Kudos for the project, but this particular set-up will not be played again in our group.

RATING: 8.9
504 is a wonderfully ambitious experiment in game design that somehow works. 9 modules have been painstakingly integrated into 504 potential games, which are not mini-games, but fully fledged Euros that take just as long to learn and set up as you'd expect from a Euro. While this may seem like a chore to some, a lot of the fun to 504 is seeing how everything fits together when you learn a new game. When it comes to the actual gameplay, the strategy and feel of each game is a surprise, and switching out a single module can change everything.

Overall, 504 is an extremely interesting experience for people that both enjoy Euros, variety, and novelty, and I'm glad this innovative piece of entertainment is in my game collection.

First and foremost, never combine 2 of the 3 fast track modules together.  They make the worst games in the system.  You can throws out those combinations immediately because they are bad.  

497 - 5/10 game should only last 2 SR and 2 BR.  Probably one of the quickest games in the pack. Military, Stock, Majority

283 - 4/10 race with production to make money and privileges for flavor.  Privileges made the decision for who would win or lose.  This game shows that I need more information about the cards.  

516 - 7/10 Explore Pickup and deliver and roads  This game is mostly won through exploration.  Money is not as much of a driver as compared to 283.  If you slack on exploring and all the points from that, you're gonna lose.  Last player has the advantage with that.  

645 - 7/10. tight point game separated by 1 point margin.

629 - 3/10.  No need to really build roads to win this game where the roads expansion is the VP condition (may have read that wrong).  That's a little odd.  Then, I learned that I had played these all wrong since the beginning.  And, I figured out 9.III after the attempt at this game.  Playing with a whiner and he quit after only a few turns.  The game's end condition is the road connections but that's the only motivation for building roads.  

129 - First no settlers game.  7/10.  Lasted about 4 rounds.  Probably gave out too much money (only for cities but still...).  Worked fine.  Like 9 in any of the III parts.  

962 - 

728 - 9/10 (avg. scores from my daughter and I)
8.III is a lot of fun and adds more to the complexity of the game.  Having to take some of your resources and make plants so that you can put more people out is difficult.  For this game, 3 plants was all that was necessary to win the game by my daughter.

7.I is simple in how it scores but really shines because of the random score times after people's turns.  

2.II, I've used that a lot.  It does well in limiting money and makes you do the .I module more.  With 8.III, it made these choices difficult.  

526 5/10

The Roads module (6) should never be played with the race (2) or production (8).  No one builds roads if they have they have hurry.  Only where 6 is in the position to make money would it be worthwhile to play with one of the other modules or where roads is what gives you VP.  As for flavor wise, 6 is probably one of the worst modules to have in the III position.

I was really thrilled about this game.
At Spiel '15 I bought it and we played through the 1-2-3 world.
It really worked! And the game was somewhat challenging even though we were debating heavily on whether or not the first player/turn order was a huge factor or not in the game.

I am inclined to give this a 10, due to the fact that it is indeed a GODDAM COOL invention! We haven't played more than the 1-2-3 and I haven't read the rules for putting the three pieces together.
It is definitely an extremely innovative concept. For this only I want to rate it a 10.

But somehow I can't see why I would like to play this, any world of it, rather than play the best games of the genre that each game represents. If any of the worlds in 504 would be as good as or better than other specific games, it would be a sheer insult to the designers of the other games.

As a game/games, my rating will now stay at 8. But I nod my head at 2F who managed to pull this off. Great!!

123: only this beginner module and the pickup and deliver was fine. I didnt understand the thematic tie of the cards and blocks and how the income was but there was no major issue with the game. Very minor downtime and very simple but no issues. Nothing exceptional. Setup time a bit long.

I feel like there may be some interesting or exciting games in this set but Im not sure Im too inclined to search through the mediocre ones like this to find them. I rather wish FF just focused and made a special game that maybe just contained 3 or 4 exceptional games in one box.b

504 is the definition of more than the sum of its parts.  My admiration and appreciation for the design feat makes it so the overall rating is likely going to be higher than most of the individual games that can be created through the system.  

This game should not exist.  FF is a mad genius.

World - rating - comment - game length and player count

593 - 4 - worked fine as game but I didn't care for shares taking such a huge role from the II spot, and the Explore/Shares combo makes the game LONGGGGGG.  Wouldn't recommend 59x unless you love Shares games and game length isn't a consideration.  The deepest of the games I've played of 504, but at too high of a playtime cost.  240 minutes for 3 players

678 - 6 - solid efficiency game.  Majorities II wasn't a huge factor due to the spending cap created by Production III.  75 minutes for 3 players

127 - 6 - fast paced pick-up-and-deliver game.  The push to constantly vary your route added to the fun.  40 minutes for 3 players.

682 - 7 - nice tension between getting a variety of land types for resources and racing to connect like-types for VP bonuses.  90 minutes for 4 players

234 - 6 - Racing with military makes for a bit of a slugfest.  Ironically, the best way to race might be to go one or two spaces at a time with a huge stack of residents.  120 minutes for 4 players

512 - 2 - First truly bad one.  Race in the third slot incentivizes rushing and compounds the randomness, but I'm hesitant to try any 51x combos in the future.  120 minutes for 4 players

817 - 5 - in many ways this is the quintessential "base" of 504 with multiple layers of arcane efficiency games taking place concurrently.  While a solid game, nothing about it grabbed me.  90 minutes for 3 players

394 - 7 - The Shares module in the second slot makes the game long, but also adds depth that is lacking from most combinations without it.  Shares with Privileges both in the top 2 slots made the game considerably longer still - I'm not sure I would use that combination again.

694 - 7 - A downright speedy Shares game compared to the other two I've played.  Military was consequential and movement was quick thanks to the Roads.  Strong recommendation to try 69x for your first Shares experience.

--- Preliminary thoughts ---

What would it say about the average game designer that spends years polishing their games to be good if you could just pull out equally great games out of a mechano?

I credit FF for his original and innovative ideas. I love some if his games, but then, the most innovative of them are just "playable". It is really amazing of this 504 system to be able to create so many playable worlds that work, but this is not what I look for in a game. If a game has 1 great variant and 5 good ones, I will always play the great one.

I'm not rating this game until I have played enough of it, but I don't think my opinion will change.

RATING: 6.5
The concept and the fact that it works is absolutely brilliant and makes this a tough thing to rate. 
The so far still few games are tried are solid but mostly fall in the rating range of about 6 on my personal scale, but the fact that there are 504 of those is intruiging in itself.

RATING: 7
I keep getting drawn back to this game; I play it in spurts. I don't have any opponents but am satisfied playing solo and fiddling with the individual game nuances. If set-up didn't take so long and if it didn't take up so much room (an entire card table barely holds one game's worth of components) I would play it more. If you're not interested in the game after reading about the concept of it, playing it probably won't spark an interest. But if 504 sounds intriguing conceptually, I think it's worth the $65 - 70 it costs from an online source. Pull it down off your shelf on a rainy day and play through 2 or 3 worlds. Or if you have a place to leave it set up, tinker with a new world after work every once in a while.

763: Also short, I enjoyed it less because I found the scoring timing a little chaotic. 6/10

An interesting exercise in game design that I’ve been hoping I might get a chance to check out since it was published, but playing it feels like you're testing unfinished prototypes - runaway stuff might happen, or insufficient catchup, or turn order advantages too hard to overcome, etc - all issues that testing and development would normally fix and overcome. I also found the rules too vague or confusing in places, trying to address too many situations that weren't relevant to me right now, and not enough detail for the situation I had right now. I thought it might get a few plays just to see what kind of experiences it can generate, as exploring a new approach is always interesting after playing so many different games over the years (I can appreciate something new even if it doesn't quite pull it off as well as I'd like), but my enthusiasm to get it to the table diminished with each new page of the rulebook.

RATING: 8
504 games of the same complexity as Catan. Learning curve for the 504 system, then each game has it's own mini learning curve. But, this "game" still is designed with class, and thoughtfulness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
"Brilliant exercise in design which translates to merely a good game. For me, it still has too many gamey FF tricks, such as requiring players to be tricksy with turn order, or to sprint ahead at just the right moment. Depending on the modules, my rating probably ranges from 3 to 7 (or maybe 8)."

What I like:
- Lots of variability
- Many modules are non-conflicty
- Relatively simple rules but deep gameplay
- Modular hex map is fun and pretty

What I don't like
- Has several FF gamey aspects
- Our learning game of 583 took 2.5 hours
- I wouldn't play with 4 of the modules (military, roads, majorities, shares)

I really admire this design, that takes 9 different mechanisms and manages to form 504 distinct games (worlds) out of them. While many rules are common across multiple worlds, each one is probably going to be quite different from all the others. 

But at it's heart, it's an FF game, so it has a design aesthetic that rubs me the wrong way. I really like about 1/3 of Power Grid, but this game is like the 2/3 that I'm not fond of.

Our game (#583) ran 2.5 hours, which felt about an hour too long. I suppose more experienced players could have ramped up their engines faster, and the game has a snowball feel where it can end very suddenly. 

Examples of rules (from #583) that I didn't like:
- Prestige cards costing $20 or $0
- Area control aspects
- The last player sprinted and ended the game unexpectedly
- Money is worthless at the end of the game

172 - Pick-Up & Deliver, Majorities, Race. A solid 6. 
The two mechanics for earning points and earning money felt disconnected.
The game was very hard to learn and teach. We struggled for 90 minutes before we could finally start. I think this is becausse of the fact that all information is put together in different modules and it is really difficult to find everything. This might get better as we become familiar with the concept.The game itself worked fine. 
Maybe it can't be solved in an easier way.
386- Priorities, Production, Roads. A Solid 7.
The first two modules of this game felt good intertwined. Just the third module felt superfluous to us. It was fun overall. We had one issue. Two rounds before game end we already knew who would win the game and couldn't do anything about it.
I prepared for this game by learning the rules beforehand and explaining the game on the spot.
Still it is a hell of a work to learn the rules for one "world". An App would help a great deal. Working through the "Book of the Worlds" is not as much fun as it sounds.
I won't be posting a rating based on just two plays for this game.

RATING: 7
I learned 504 using World 163, which is pick-up-and-deliver for points, road-building for income, and bonus cards on the side. These are mechanics that appeal to me, but the game as a whole felt a little bland. It felt a little hard to differentiate yourself in the scoring--there weren't really many different strategies that could be pursued. The road-building also felt a little out of phase with the delivery, as a good half of the deliveries I made were before my network amounted to anything. It was only in the last turn or two that differences in income started to emerge, and by then stuff to spend it on hard started to run out. It's hard to judge the game just on this one world, but I was expecting more.

A Friedemann Friese game where there are '504' possible games made of nine modules. This feels like overkill or a lack of designer decisions... Let's find out one day but I think this is more a concept or an experiment than a (good) game. WAY too many rules for what it brings. This is a bad game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A little clunky but this is a massive achievement in gaming. Literally 504 different games (although I'm sure some are fairly similar to each other). Takes a bit of getting used to the rules since a) they change from game to game and b) not everything is used each time or used differently depending on the modules or the position it's in. There is a lot of cross referencing and pairing together phases so it takes a bit to set up and figure out a game. I'd probably recommend pre-randomizing a game beforehand, learning the rules and then gather everyone to play. Setup and rules referencing probably takes ~30 minutes for each game.

Not sure how I'll keep track outside of either using the website or marking them here or a spreadsheet. Currently keeping track through my play history of this game.


Overall, it's hard to rate this system. The couple that I've played have been fine but not outstanding. So far, my rating for the game aspect is probably a 6-7, but my rating for just the sheer magnitude of this project is a 10. Kind of conflicted on what to rate this as.

Played game 123 as a first try. 
As money over 70$/turn has not enough importance, the world seems quite unbalanced... 
The luck of the draw of the priviledge cards is too important.

As an academic exercise and as a tool for reflection on the interplay of different game mechanisms, this is a fantastic endeavor. Unfortunately it seems like the games that the different permutations of the rules produce aren't just that interesting.

I admire Friedemann Friese, and 504 sounded like an intriguing experiment that ought to be supported even tho' I suspect it is doomed to failure: probably a great game to nominate to have with you when you are washed up on a desert island but unlikely to demand much table time when competing against other standalone games. When I saw this new on Amazon for just £45, I felt I'd resisted temptation long enough. I must remember to pack it in my luggage next time I'm sailing near any desert islands.

played only 123, liked it, and made me want to try other combinations.

456 fell flat, but we missed something from the errata, so needs another try.

so far I'm intrigued by the system, not sure if it will give us a game I really like. Figuring out the rules is difficult, and interferes with the game play (hopefully only for the moment as we're still learning the modules).

We're getting better at figuring out the rules, and we've played a couple combinations now that I liked better than the first two they suggest (635, 217). 

This is getting better with more plays, fewer rules issues because we understand things more, and the games we've semi-randomly picked were more fun than the two suggested you start with.

I played this only once, but I'm quite sure this rating will be never higher then 6, and this for 2 reasons:

1) This is a very expensive game. But it doesn't give you 504 excellent games. The one we played was at best mediocre and I believe most of them will be. If some combination would give an extraordinary game, we would already have heard about it, but even then it would be silly to add 503 medium or probably even bad games to it. It reminds of those "1.000 games in 1 box", were you would only play 3 or 4 at most from.
2)If you play game X a couple of times, you have the big advantage you don't have to explain the rules anymore and can just start playing. With this game you will never have this. As you have all those different possibilities, you wanna try a combination you haven't tried before. Which makes someone has to struggle himself trough the set-up and rulebook. It makes this will never be a game you will take as everybody knows it, but will only play sporadically (and therefore for me 6), when someone had the time to prepare a combination upfront.

I'm not so sure about this one.  On one hand it is such a great achievement, and a monumental undertaking.  On the other, I am not so sure about any of the particular "worlds" I have played.  They are okay, but are there any truly great games hiding in here?  Sure, they work.  They even have interesting decisions and each world does feel distinct from the others (which was what initially worried me about it).  But at the same time, I am not *excited* about any of them.  By its nature it invites you to explore all the worlds, but it is so unwieldy it kind of discourages you from exploring all the worlds at the same time.  

I think the idea of this game may be better than the reality, which is unfortunate to say because I was so excited about it when I heard about it.  Still a landmark in the realm of game design, so it has my respect if not my original enthusiasm.  Still fun to explore, so always down to try out a new world.

I must admit, that I'm very much impressed. It is a pure essence of gaming. It's so much fun to see how diffrent combinations of rules work together. even if some of them produce not a good game, the fun of exploration is worth every single coin spent on this GAME.

Some called it a "bit of a hot mess", may be more of a study on game design than an enjoyable game. Despite the many setup combinations, it starts to feel like a soulless cube pusher; lacks theme.

I played only one setting (549; Discovery, military, stocks) at Spiel 2015. Unfortunately, this combination was extremely dull and there was not one original or interesting aspect to this combination. Additionally, the initial money was increased with turn-order (to compensate a possible first player bonus). However, there was no such thing in this combination and this really took me out of the game (there was a quite a strong rich-get-richer mechanism at work). If such drawbacks are also very apparent at the selected combination they present at Spiel, I really have no desire to try other combinations if they may be better. I do not expect that super interesting game play will emerge.

I know that my rating is a bit unfair, since the game offers many different combinations. But I have no desire to play that many games to be "sure" that I do not like the game.

The one 2015 Essen release which I really had down as a "must have" - and my wife and I bought this for ourselves as a joint Christmas present.

I've not played it more than 3 or 4 times so far (plus a couple of PBF games here on BGG), and to be honest I've not been too impressed with most of the individual game so far. (The best was a 612 we played in April - we liked the road-building, although this particularly game seemed to reward just going straight for roads, by spending all your money on residents and just making 1 delivery per turn for income, rather than the longer-term play of upgrading your trolley's abilities.) But I absolutely love the way the whole thing works, and how the rulebook is put together. I expect that in time this will wear off and I might lower my rating for this, but 4 months on I'm still quite excited by this game (or collection of games). While I've not played a great game from it yet, none have been bad either - I expect that, if one were to rate the games individually, I'd have many of these as a 5, but with quite a lot of 6s and even a few 7s for the very best games. I think this is good enough, in common with the ingenious system for combining the individual modules into 504 different games, is worthy of an 8 rating overall - after all, they say the whole is greater than the sum of its parts ;)

Just played the first 123 combination. I should reserve my judgement until I play others combinations, but I don't know when this will be because it did not go that well with the family (a bit fiddly with all the pieces, and rules are not straightforward). I am still happy I got this because I think it is a crazy genius idea of a game.

This game is a design wonder. Initially I rated this game as a 10. I was impressed by the wide range of possible game worlds within the same system. My current rating of 9 reflects the fact that I've yet to find a true gem within the 504 possible constellations.

I've tried the following game worlds (in this order): 123, 456, 789, 892, 247, 631, 915, 574, 368, 541.

As I've rated the game worlds on http://504-2f.de/ (using the BGG value system):

8 - 915
7 - 247, 574, 892
6 - 123, 368, 541, 631, 789
5 - 456

However, I suspect that the true feat of this game is to have created the grounds for a future paradigm shift in game design. The consequences of this game will be felt in future games by many different designers.

I love the idea of being able to play different games. I played 123 then played 219. It felt like the same game, but the game was obviously different. We were doing most of the same thing, but there were different outcomes and different items involved in the game. I think it's going to feel like playing 504 different variants of the same game, because of the way it looks. It's not like going from Settlers of Catan to Ticket to Ride. The board is always going to look the same no matter what map you play on. Don't get me wrong. So far I love the game and it's been great fun. These are just thoughts. A lot of the games are going to be completely different from one another, but because you are playing with the same pieces it's feels, to me, like playing the same game. Also at the beginning the rules are all so tedious and you have to follow the play order closely or everything get screwed up. I suspect about 10 games of different modules would allow me to be able to pick a random game and start up and play it. All in all it's a great game and I'm glad I bought it. It will make the table several times.

RATING: 5
Too early to finalise my rating, which may fall and is based on a single randomly-chosen play. I found myself in a slightly fiddly game of something akin to Risk which was far from challenging and over very quickly. Altogether an unsatisfactory experience, but I've marked it up nevertheless and will give it some more plays before finalising the rating.

Second play was a little more interesting; a pick-up-and-deliver version of the first game with less randomness involved. Rating stays the same.

After third game, this time involving auctions (normally a plus for me), and which I won, I am downgrading the game. The modules all feel rather samey and unchallenging. I'd rather play something else.

RATING: 1
I had really high hopes and was sorely disappointed.  I hope that fighting more with the thing-that-claims-to-be-a-game will reveal a gem, but I'm losing hope.  The book of worlds is a mess -- it can require hours to decipher what a combination actually means, just to play a mediocre 30 minute game that you probably have the rules wrong for anyway.  I tried to play this with some of the smartest people I know, all of whom have decades of experience with advanced games, and we couldn't make a playable experience from what comes in the box.

The app that was developed by fans is a start, but it's not mature enough yet, and it REALLY should have been provided by the publisher.  The book of worlds as presented in paper form is not a rulebook -- it is a cryptic summary presented out of order with typos.  Oh, yes, and the typos.  Serious contradictions, omissions, and ambiguities -- so, even if you finally figure out the rules for the mediocre game you've randomly assembled, you're probably playing it wrong because the rules are actually wrong.

This is a beta, not a publishable product.  It might some day becomes something truly amazing, but right now it is just a pile of components.  There is no excuse for an experienced designer working with an experienced publisher to release something like this.

A more subtle complaint is the rampant use of conditions throughout the game.  When you have nested conditions referring to which other modules you have selected in the rules for a module, you do not have an elegant modular system.  You have a mess of hacked rules that do not do justice to the intellectual exercise that FF set out on and promised to customers.  There are not 9 modules.  There is a huge web of special special cases presented in 9 colors.

So, I do not think it is hyperbole to rate this game a 1/10.  I love the concept, but it fails to deliver in many ways.

RATING: 8
Ambitious clever exciting extreme "variable setup" game. (I'm in the camp who says 504 is in the spirit of Kingdom Builder, Dominion, etc, just to a much more radical degree.) Every game presents new situations with new strategies needed. Despite the skeptics and mockers, I have found that in practice the game works and I enjoy playing it.

It's interesting to see how slight changes (e.g. playing world 123 and then world 132) feel familiar yet different (I really got a sense of traveling between parallel worlds sometimes!), and how introducing new modules alters things even more.

The rules are (inevitably) a bit tricky at first, but after a few plays, the overall system structure becomes clear and gels in one's mind, and it gets easier and easier to grok a new "world". Despite some occasional glitches which are corrected in errata/FAQ, it's overall impressively coherent for such an ambitious system.

A lot of forum posters want to use apps and websites to generate specific rule pages for each world, but so far I'm finding the physical "Book of Worlds" and rulebook quite adequate enough to use without problems, and so I haven't felt the need to use one of those apps/websites. The Book of Worlds is pretty clever and works well, I would say.

(Similarly I play Neuroshima Hex physically with no problem, but many people who use the app say they find it too difficult to resolve combat with the physical boardgame...)

The box is heavy and full of all kinds of game bits, of which you'll use only a subset in any given session. Setup (and rule explanation of course!) is longer since every world needs different bits and map setup, but that goes with the territory for this kind of game!

* One concern: I will probably be playing 2-player most often, but suspect that many worlds are more interesting with more than 2 players. (E.g. stock-share-holding worlds.)

=====

Some practical annoyances:

* It is BIG! Takes up a lot of table real estate, more than I expected.

* The stupid alternating concave/convex tile hex-sides make setup and teardown and storage more cumbersome than necessary. Regular hexagons with straight sides are used in most games with hex tiles for a good reason...

* As usual alas for 2F games, the rules are in dubious awkward non-native-sounding English with suboptimal proofreading. There is more errata/FAQ than I would have hoped/expected.

* Only 8 ore tokens are supplied. That's enough for the 2 cities which each need 4 in many worlds, but certain worlds need 1 more off-map token of each good type.

Only played 123 and 456 so far. I enjoyed 123 quite a bit as a light, fast pick-up and deliver.  It took us a bit longer to grock how to combine the standard rules with the special rules to play 456.  We made a couple mistakes initially, but the bigger issue was that we perhaps didn't make the best decisions on attacking and fell into a position where the 3 of us could not end the game - once we had explored the map, it was impossible for anyone to generate enough income to gain an overwhelming number of residents to attack someone's headquarters. Military end game conditions just don't seem exciting, and it seemed strange that the natural next 2nd game (456) would be, at least to us, a breakable combination.  Still excited to explore more combinations, but it seems the best way to do this is to research which combinations are known to be great and learn the rules in advance so you're ready to teach it, rather than just selecting a random combination and learning it on the spot.  This actually feels a bit like some Cheapass games, with a combination of some mechanisms and universal components to make a fun, puzzley, but not particularly memorable game experience.

this game is absolute genius. I applaud you, Friedmann. For those eurogamers who see games as interesting puzzles to be done once or twice and then moved away from onto the next interesting puzzle, this game system offers them the  ultimate game! A death blow to the 'variety' idea propping up the cult of the new! Genius! The cult of the new acolytes must either accept this as the ultimate game, or admit that their goals are simply crass consumerism disguised as a hobby--that their hobby is simply a buying spree, with little appreciation for the games themselves.

It would be hard for me to let go of the goal of 'getting better at a game', but I am strangely attracted to this one. Strange because I am not a cult of the new devotee, and do not generally relish new things for their own sake. Also, I like themes. 

BUT! this one seems to offer endless play on some interesting mechanics, which is very attractive as a continual diversion. I like sandboxes. I may buy it someday, must try first. Kudos!

This is the big one. After first opening the box, it is initially quite daunting to approach. The rulebook (unsurprisingly) is like nothing else, and for all its faults (some minor translation issues being the chief amongst them) the Book of Worlds is a staggering accomplishment in itself. Recommendation - do just read the rules for 123 and play that. Then pick whichever game is going to be played next, maybe set up the board (before anybody else shows up) and play through a turn. The rules seem to fall into place easier when the right components are in front of you. I'm thinking that after a half dozen games of different modules, reading the individual rulesets might be less of a challenge, and just throwing together a game to play with a group there and then be much more feasible.

At the time of writing I am in the first tentative steps of exploring 504. That this is a game that really does have such vast scope for exploration of its potential forms is one of the most exciting things about it - leading this to being the first ever game that I had to buy on release, sight unseen.

It is undoubtedly a work of genius - are the games going to be great? I really couldn't say, and don't yet care. I've played three games so far (123, 456 and 816) - enjoyed them, would play any of them again, but am eager to explore further. I don't know whether I am going to want to keep trying new combinations, or whether I'll find that there are certain worlds that I want to keep returning to. It's going to be interesting to find out!

I have a weakness for buying video game compilations. These are discs where dozens of older games are put together in one package. Even though newer and better games are released I like those compilations because I love the sense of exploration and discovery. 504 is like the board game version of one of those compilation discs. I have read a lot of criticism about this game that it is a failure because none of the 504 combinations are one of the best games ever. From the combinations we have played all of the games were fun and worked mechanically. We would not play many of them over and over again, but re-playing the same scenario over and over is not the point of this game. The point is the sense of discovery and exploration. In that department this game delivers like nothing else. The biggest downfall is that it can be intimidating to learn.

There's no question that this is a highly innovative "game".  It really pushes the boundaries of what's possible with boardgames and I'm glad it exists.  However, my experience with this has been fairly subdued by an understandably fiddly setup to each combination followed by what is usually a fairly lackluster resulting game.  In the end, I find that the result is basically 504 mediocre games in one box.

I just have to admire this for the ambition placed in trying to design something like this - generate a blend of mechanics so that you can have a comprehensive game no matter what three main mechanics are put together. Certainly some games are better than others, but overall, it seems like this holds a lot of potential, and I'll have to come back and revisit this each time I play. The learning curve is steep, but certainly I can see that this would be a great title to make a list for "if you only have a couple of games are deserted on a remote island, which ones to you bring?"

123 - 5. Pretty simplistic, and I think it's hard to get differentiation and the luck of the draw has a decent impact on your ultimate outcome.

853 - 7.5 Really enjoyed this combination. Loved the exploration and how it worked so nicely with the privileges, and the production also added a nice little economic element. I'd totally play this one again.

427 - 4. According to the official rules, the endgame condition most likely met is to buy all your residents, which seems like it would take an extremely long time to do. We played that you remove lost residents and settlements from the game, shortening it quite a bit, which would move this version to a 6.5.

754 - 7. We enjoyed the exploration aspect, and the majority control made for some good tension. We didn't play it exactly right, unfortunately.

1 play: 672 (prototype -- numbers have changed in production version?)

Wow, this is SUCH a cool design! Just in concept alone, it is so ... ambitious! It's called '504' because there are 504 possible games here: each digit represents one of 9 different mechanisms (e.g., area majority, race, economy, etc.). To pick a game, pick a 3-digit number where each digit is different. The first number represents the main focus of the game, the second is less important, and the third is even less; or something like that. 9 x 8 x 7 = 504 combinations!

Apparently the game mostly works, but the race games are still in need of tweaking; so we played one of those (672, I think). Experience proved itself, with F winning convincingly against the two of us. I hope I can come back and try the pick-up-and-deliver and/or stock game ... I do love those mechanisms!

Played only one of the many. This results more like a designer's exercise of creativity and self challenge probably, than a game to consider in a traditional way. I salute the first but am not impressed by the second.

I found this for the equivalent of €40, and absolutely had to have it.

Having some dreams of one day perhaps designing games myself, I find this very interesting from a mechanics perspective.

By now, I've played it a few times. Different modules play very differently in combination. I want to get more plays of this, but it tends to be hard to convince other players.

Didn't really buy this game in order to play it.  I wanted to understand the modules and knew it would be a box packed with contents. The gameplay itself is fairly basic, as each module has to function off of a similar ruleset that is able to be modified based on the modules selected.  To get familiar, we used module 1-2-3.  I can't imagine wanting to play the same module set again, but with the variable options, it would be interesting to see how much different another game would be.

My rating as a game system as a whole, although some of the games in here certainly earn an 8 and maybe even a 10.  It's amazing this works at all, let alone produces clever games. So far what I especially like is how fast the games are (at least with 2 players, and once you've figured out the rules). Most games only take 5 or 6 rounds, with distinct start, middle, and end games.

The best part is deciding which world to play next. The more modules you learn (and in different slots) opens up completely new ways to mix and match.

The games are very stripped-down and focus on 2 or 3 core mechanics without any fluff getting in the way. The more worlds you play, the more you enjoy it. This is a delight for any student of game design. But if you prefer lots of theme without having to read a lot of rules, this is probably not the game (system) for you.

RATING: 8.5
Really cool design.  Takes a bit to figure out rules and how they work.  There are general rules and then minutiae for each module.  Top module (first number) is how to score points, middle module (second number) is how to make money and bottom module (third number) is 'flavor' which is actually like a game bonus tacked on.  Money buys you residents which allow actions.  That's premise of the game, using residents to take actions to gain points.  

Played:
631 - Roads was a really cool victory point mechanism.  I enjoyed the building and it all made sense.  Thought I had collected a set, when in fact I hadn't.  Game can end really quickly.  Factories to make money was cool, but I got a little too invested in that when I could've saved some $$ to get a couple of more roads.  Solid game, could play multiple times and be happy.  Pick up and deliver trolley (as flavor) was almost cool, but didn't serve enough of a purpose.  Privileges was pretty awesome, as the cards added some cool features.

485 -  Militaristic game where no one really wanted to fight each other.  Military is actually more of an area control mechanism (when scoring points), you can just steal other peoples territory.  Meh.  Production to make money was solid, as the plants engine was interesting, goods/resources a fun thing to use.  Exploration was hard to understand and a wonky mechanism as a whole, I would like to see how it interacts with other modules as it just didn't really work with the map we were using.  It didn't encourage use to get near each other and fight.  Exploration+Production kind of encourages solitaire play.

297 - All of the modules wanted to be the star.  We saw potential in each of them, but they simply did not mesh well together.  Stocks was difficult to understand and there are still parts we don't fully know if we played correctly.  Majorities was cool, racing to get to the tiles, but still having to adhere to piece limits.

[b]Game 738[/b]

There was a lot of hype for this game, but I always was skeptical. The concept sounds very interesting, but if you think about it, there is a far better chance of the results being mediocre or even bad than great. Of course there is a a website where the combinations get rated, but so far the amount of votes is a bit low to be really useful.
We played game 738. It is many non-competitive territory building to score for majorities. And there is a system to allow you to increase your income. And money helps you perform actions.
The game was interesting, but I'm not sure how I feel about it. First of all the territory building was non competitive, which is a bit uncommon but it also removes a potential source of tension in the game. But the biggest problem I had was that the scoring can happen after just any player's turn. If you just played and set yourself up to score, and a scoring round is triggered, you'll probably score big. At game end this can be devastating. Especially if the game ends before your last turn! There is a compensation of 3 points for that, but that is a joke.
So it was interesting, but this game wasn't great.

RATING: 5
I think it is fair to say that most people's enjoyment of 504 will depend very heavily on what modules are used. No-one could possibly enjoy 504 different games, even if they were the "top" 504 games in existence, so to assume that each game will work for everyone is a silly premise.

That said, playing a game heavy with shares was probably a poor starting choice for me.

Coupled with each game being a learning game (so learning rules, learning set-up, exploring the game space) means you'll never quite get the full experience.

It's a marvelous accomplishment, but it was never a fun game to play. Bonus point for the design if not the end result.

Essen 2015.

Thoughts after having played world 123: 
Definitely an interesting experience. A fun game, but calculating the income was a bit fiddly and somewhat slowed down the game. Still, we played a 3 player game and we managed to finish within 1h30m (of which about 30 mins were setup and rules explanation), so not bad for being a first play.
I love playing new games and I'm very excited to try out another world. With that in mind, I think this game is a winner!

Amazing concept.  The interplay of the various "rules" that define a scenario is staggering.  Just amazing.  Unfortunately, each game really only feels "Meh".  The amount of "game" in the box...unbelievable....the overall quality of the "games" in the box...underwhelming.  

Couldn't be happier that I had a chance to play this, but...I probably never need to play it again.

This is a piece of art.
I feel it is one of the most important games published since Catan. "But it only contains a bunch of generic mechanics and the games are completely abstract" you might object. And yes, you are right with these observations. If I look at the versions I played so far, completely isolated, they where typical "solid" games, something we had fun playing, but nothing to overwhelming. BUT! This game is so much more than the sum of its parts.
This is a game that explores the essence of what a game is through the media of a game. Yes, that is very meta and self-refferencial and might feel a bit artsy-fartsy. But this game offers very interesting insights not only for game designers but also for the normal gamer. In every game we played there where moments where questions like this popped up:
What if we changed the module on the third place? How would that game be different from what we are playing?
If you would only change one of the modules to X, this would be like playing game Y.
What would happen if we only swapped the modules on the first two spaces? The game would be almost the same, but the criteria for points and money swapped. How would that game be different from what we are playing?
etc.

These are questions that go beyond the single game that we are actually playing. They let us realize that games are not just the way they are by nature. A designer actively chooses from an infinite number of possibilities to give us the best possible gaming experience.
504 does that by avoiding exactly that premise. It is almost a game design machine. There are games in this box, that have never been play tested. So no designer has evaluated several possibilities and chosen the one which makes for the best game. You simply choose 3 mechanics at random, put them in a blender and see what you end up with.
This also sheds light on the innumerous games that are constructed more or less exactly like this. It is a technique a designer can work with easily. Take a few things you know and rearrange them in a new way. The result may be a very good game by itself. But where is the innovation? By taking this approach to the extreme, 504 asks a few of the very big questions:

Why are games the way they are? Why are so many of them similar to each other? If there are unlimited possibilities for a designer, why aren't there more games that are completely different from what we have seen so far?

Maybe we designers (and I am including myself in that) have been to content with this way of making games, instead of asking ourselves: what can I do differently? It is an interesting coincidence that 504 is published in the same year, where the other games everybody talks about are Pandemic Legacy and Time Stories. Two games that radically reimagine what the medium of board games can do.
To me it feels like one era closes with 504 and a new era opening with these two games, by giving a possible answer to the questions 504 poses. An era where hopefully more designers ask themselves: how can I push the boundaries of what board gaming is further? This last happened with Catan. One game that challenges the whole medium to do better.
And that is why I think 504 is one of the most important games published since Catan and a true piece of art. My biggest respect to Friedemann for the incredible amount of work this must have been, and more importantly for the balls to tell us to try and do better.


P.S:
A few experimental set-up's using 504:

Play any random combination. At the end, ask yourselves: which Module on the third space would support the other two mechanics the best. Change the third module to that and play again.

Play a random combination. Then swap the module in the first and second place and play again. See how swapping the criteria for points and money changes the game.

Play any game from your collection. Then ask yourself: which modules on which places in 504 would best depict the game you just played. Play that game in 504 and see what happens.

If you have a little more time, make a chain of games. Start by playing any random combination. At the end, the winner gets to change any one module. The other two will have to stay on the places they are. Play again, repeat. See the game you are playing evolve.

world 789: Rating = 5.  Interesting, but not scaled well, at least with 2 players.  By the time we entered stage 3 of the game, we had played all our settlements.  Things should probably be more expensive.

world 631: Rating 7.5.  I didn't expect any of the 504 games to be this good!  I actually hope to play 631 again, as I would with any other game that I rate this highly.  

Overall rating of 504: 9.  This is about as high as I would ever rate a game with only 2 plays, but it is an incredible feat of game design (worthy of being on my shelf), and world 631 is so good that I would consider buying 504 just for that one world alone.  

I have bought a lot of board games over the years, and I can honestly say that of them all 504 is clearly one of my favorite 5 purchases!

RATING: 4.5
The greatest disappointment this year. I expected something fresh and cool but this was just another themeless unbalanced prototype. I understand why it feels like this and why the game had to be designed the way it was designed to accomodate 504 very different variations. I can't deny that 504 is innovative and skillfully designed BUT that still doesn't mean that the game is any good. To play this isn't fun and I suspect almost any single-purpose designed game will beat the 504 variant resembling it. I guess the main problem might be the complete lack of theme, something you don't even understand you need until you don't have it.

I really wanted to like this more than I did. No doubt this is a monumental achievement in design. Unfortunately the first game that I played fell really flat, and I have a very hard time getting it off the shelf to try to figure out each rule set. Ultimately it feels like this is 504 mediocre games instead of one really great one. Unfortunate.

I rate this a 9/10 for the overall innovation and technical achievement and quantity and variety.

Will there be a hidden great game between the 504 combinations? No!

None of the specific game combinations are likely to be rated higher than 8/10 - even the best combinations will probably lack the innovation and polish in components and gameplay to be great.

Each of the 9 modules are fairly standard and neither combination is likely to be something that no one has never at least thought of before. Any combination of generic modules will lack the fine-tuned mechanisms of dedicated game designs - small details can make all the difference between a bad or a good or a great game. If nothing else the generic components will necessarily be less polished and more fiddly than bespoke components.

But there are definitely 9 fundamentally different types of games and 72 significantly different variants of these to explore - and then another 432 minor variations.

For anybody with any interest in game design, this is an experimental laboratory for games. Try to change just one major or minor module and see what difference that makes to the game play for a better understanding of game design and indeed your own tastes in games. Further, some game combinations could be used as inspiration and starting points for designing your own games.

Surely many gamers and designers thought that something like this is a crazy idea that could never work, but it does, and all 504 combinations are probably at least half-decent games with practically infinite variety and replayability.

3 games to play to try all 9 modules.
9 games to play to try all 9 modules in all positions.
72 games to play to try all primary and secondary module combinations.
504 games to play to try all flavours of all combinations.

123: 6/10 - Ok, simple, quick, pick up and deliver race.

456: 7/10 - Interesting area control game. Initial slow start with exploration and very tight money. End-game dragged a bit alternating between players edging towards victory by getting all their settlements placed; and others desperately throwing themselves into do-or-die attacks (ultimately leading to a 60-59-32-00 Victory).
*Played incorrectly: Income tokens should be kept for the rest of the game for ever increasing income.

789: 7/10 - A good, multi-level business game. Majority control game for the different types of terrain funded by production and sale of sets of goods as well as from selling off shares in your own company. As each share is worth a lot of victory points this has to be done very carefully only as needed and if worthwhile to expand your production and sales and territories. And other players can buy up the sold off shares (and thus victory points) if/when they have cash to spare or by selling off their own shares if they think they are doing worse than you. For example, although my own company ended up being the worst, I rescued 2nd place by buying the shares in the winning company/player.

Mix and match two of eight major game systems with a production game system to play one of 504 variant combinations. Games are built from the Book of Worlds. From investing to farming, pick-up-and-deliver to area control, make it a race, throw in some war gaming. Maps on hex tiles. Impressive that the variants we have tried work together well enough. Cool feat to have accomplished but a little generic and it gets a little tedious skipping through to get to the relevant steps of play order after the novelty of random mixed game systems wears off.

123 - (once solo and once with 3) - basic but fast and smooth. Feels like a race to the finish which I like.
215 - (once solo) - solo'd this one to see if I could work out how to use the book of worlds. It played out in an interesting manner where as a new city was discovered every player had to rush to it or fell behind in the race. 
So far I am loving this game for the ability to try out all the different sets, and the core gameplay is elegant and clever in the way I like.

Please note that as with most "anthology games", my rating for the whole tends to be whatever the highest rating I gave for a game contained therein, because I can always just play that "best" game. It also means that if I play the worst first, the rating will buoy as I find better games therein. That said, on to the ratings!

[bgcolor=#93c47d][color=#000000] 1 [/color][/bgcolor][bgcolor=#4a86e8][color=#ffffff] 2 [/color][/bgcolor][bgcolor=#38761d][color=#ffffff] 3 [/color][/bgcolor] [b][bgcolor=#ff66cc] 4 [/bgcolor][/b] I know it's sort of a training world, but due to being part of the 504 system, the rules are convoluted and hard to understand for literally a very simple, pick-up-and-deliver-as-fast-as-you-can game, with privilege cards you can buy to make each player a little different in the game. Then, once you're into the game, pretty quickly, the need for money utterly disappears in a 2-player game, yet you still take income. Finally, there just wasn't any thrill to poor little world 123. I trust that this is the least interesting of the 504 combinations, though, and look forward to more engaging module trios.

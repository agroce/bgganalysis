RATING: N/A
(6) copies along with Westeros and War of Five Kings cycles, and the two deluxe expansions for the Starks and Lannisters. The game is not getting enough play so I stopped acquiring after the War of Five Kings Cycle and will simply make decks from what I have.

Is what it is. An absurd deck builder LCG that is totally inelegant and can only be enjoyed if you are have basically every possible card memorized. I am a sucker for deck building (even if the game arguably doesn't actually warrant the time or attention) and for what it's worth isn't a CCG model which would preclude it from being worthy of consideration as a decent game at all.

Great mechanisms, very thematic, works greatly as a 2-player game. Get only 1 core if you plan on playing 2-player games. Not sure about higher players counts.

abit heavy as i never played a custom deck building game before, there are a lot of details going on during the game and it will only go smoother when u are more familiar to the characters and abilities, currently owning only 1 core box, looking forward to play more often as im a big fan of GOT.

RATING: 3.5
Not my game. You have to keep track of your opponents card too much to be able to play at all. All the cards have little effects that at least I cannot remember. I also don't like that game isn't balanced at all but that is left to player. For some this means endless opportunies, for me it means lazy half-done game desingn and playtesting.

I love this card game. It really makes you think. Every decision that you make feels important. Also, as a big Game of Thrones fan, I think they did a pretty good job of capturing the feel of Game of Thrones pretty well in the card game. 

A criticism that a lot of people have for this game is that if you want to make a "full deck", as it stands now, you need three core sets. However, it's still significantly cheaper than getting into Magic: The Gathering, and if you just want to try it out, one core set is fine. Also, as the game gets more chapter packs, having three core sets will be less important.

The rule changes from first to second edition have only a small impact on the game play.  The biggest effect of the change was to reboot from a very large cardpool to a more manageable size.  New houses are fun, but the game is missing something without all those cards/options.  It will get there over the next year or two, and there's still a lot you can do with the cards that have been released.  This is not just for lifestyle/competitive players.  You can have a great time playing friends with just the core set, although I guarantee you will want at least a second set once you start playing.

The two player game is vastly different than the 3/4 player game. The role selection in the latter precludes the need for constant diplomacy, though it is obviously still going to be quite important. Great in both formats, however.

Now my second favorite LCG. It plays much less fiddly than the first edition and I like the feel of all of the great houses. The issue is I have to compare it to Conquest, which I feel is just a more innovative game (which is to be expected as this is actually a fairly old game). As sad as it is though they may turn out to be my most played card game as there are more players than for Conquest.

RATING: 9
A justified reboot of the excellent 1st edition, which was showing its age and suffering from a high barrier of entry. While staying true to the mechanics that made the first edition a great game it manages thorough streamlining of archaic rules, a fresh art direction, the addition of 2 new factions, and truly exceptional 'seeding' of concepts that  will likely be explored in upcoming expansions. 

This "core" product is the best entry point for any LCG to date, despite several concessions having been made to appeal to veteran players - the complexity of card text is a little higher than some, and the distribution of cards (most are singletons) creates a larger starting card pool, albeit at the cost of some increased randomness when playing with a single Core.

I made the transition from the first edition to this one at Gencon 2015, picking up 3 cores, and haven't looked back since.

If you're unfamiliar with the 1st edition, this game stands out for:
1) Its interpretation the theme/source material (the books)
2) The strategical "plot deck", allowing for long term planning and resources not subject to random draw.
3) Three viable avenues of attack through military, intrigue, and power challenges.
4) A thoroughly enjoyable multiplayer format
5) The uncertainty and high stakes of knowing that, just like in the books, nothing is safe. Valar Morghulis!

RATING: 9
I really enjoyed the first edition- they've just made so many improvements to give us this edition.  To start, they've made your deck more likely to be faction pure- no splashing a single card from another faction just because the card is amazing.  Second, they've increased the cost spread.  I almost never saw anyone run anything with more than a four gold cost in 1st edition.  Here?  7 gold cards definitely see play.

They did basically everything right in this edition... and they also added two new factions.  Can't complain about a thing!

It's okay. Nothing I've seen so far really gets me excited to play, but I've never read the books or seen the show. I feel like not having any interest in the setting has really dampened my potential enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 8
I recently reclaimed this from my trade pile, because I do actually like the gameplay and how it balances out the thematic feelings of confrontation and treachery. The GoT 2nd edition board game will always be my go-to for this IP when I have the proper player count, but this isn't a bad alternative and eventually I'll pick up the other packs.

5 plays in this is a very good card game.  Hits the theme of A Song of Ice and Fire perfectly.  I'm normally not an LCG guy but I can't wait to purchase expansions and chapter packs to watch the characters and events evolve.  I've only played 1v1 so depending on how much fun melee is (3-4p) my rating may increase.

A great game is back in a new dress!
With refined mechanics, a higher average cost of cards and without the ubiquitous plot "Valar Morghulis", gameplay is more centered on the main characters and definitely provides an engaging experience.

It is not just a game for the fans of novels/tv show, but a proper good game with lots of choices. From deckbuilding to gameplay, many nuances and layers force players to struggle their way towards victory.

It is the only game that matters? Probably not, but one of the best indeed!

So far we had a lot of fun playing casual joust and exploring the different factions. With the still limited cardpool, 3 coresets are necessary. Interested how casual and competetive play compare. Will see at my first tournament in April (probably no chance for me winning one of the playmats). Haven't tried melee yet.

RATING: 8
I only have experience with Magic and NetRunner as other TCGs, and this is more comparable to Magic than it is to NetRunner.
But there are a few things I clearly see as improvements over Magic:
* [b]The setting[/b]! I'm a big fan of the Song of Ice and Fire book-series and the card game truly comes to life if you know the stories behind the characters/cards.
* Each turn both (all) players bring units to the table before the fighting begins.
* Fighting is split into 3 different types with various effects if the attacker wins (either kill a guy, steal a victory point or make the opponent discard)
- Gold doesn't carry over from turn to turn. Instead there is income at turn-start which really encourages to go all in

But with only 1 core set you are limited with your deck-building possibilities, and some rules are not in effect (playing a double for your top guys to protect better them).
We have 2 core sets which enables us to build 8 mono-factions decks from which 4 almost tournament-legal decks can be used at the same time (we have 4 stacks of 15 neutral cards that each get mixed into the mono-faction to build the decks).

Update: Still a 10 well into the second cycle. The fact that the Organized Play program is thriving for Thrones in my area certainly helps. Playing at competitive tournaments is challenging, rewarding, and fun because the Thrones community is excellent.

----------

Probably my favorite tabletop game of all time. A tense, thematic, skill-based game with endless replayability. Hopefully the ever-expanding cardpool will continue to maintain the incredibly high standard of quality inherent to the core set and first chapter pack.

'when you play the game of game of thrones: the card game of thrones game card of the games throne, you either win or you say screw you imma play wildfire' - Rin 'Cersei' Grant

unless you've been living under a rock or a vegetative state, you've heard of game of thrones. with such loveable characters as tireiron the funny dwarf. and khaleesi the mheesa. and also blood, nudity, sex, and smartly written dialogue. the card game attempts to capture that, except it has no blood, nudity, sex or dialogue...unless you make it yourself. so why should i play this you ask. i dunno. 

will says its a 'living card game'. what does that mean? maybe it means there's a heart of the cards. so yu gi oh was right. so if i happen to draw exactly what i need everytime, its the heart of the cards. 
anyways, you build the deck, you scrape up cash, you play your dudes, they kill other dudes or do spy things. you gather the power. would not recommend to small children. they may want to watch the show after playing.

Now that we are watching the tv show I'm interested in checking out this game.
Update: I bought the game but we didn't enjoy it really. The theme is fun but the actual mechanics are sort of boring. I can see the appeal if you get heavy into the deck building and deck construction, but it's not very good with just the recommended decks out of the core box. I didn't find myself liking it enough to want to invest in any of the deck building at all. Traded away.

After I stopped playing Magic the Gathering (due to the amount of money it consumed) I was looking for the LCG replacement. And I finally found it! This is the best LCG I've played. For me at least. It is a combination of great theme, beautiful art and whats most important - great mechanics!
There are multiple layers of tactics to think about. The three types of challenges give multiple possibilities to attack and defend. The plot deck is as important as the draw deck. Each Faction has it's own play style. The deckbulding is fun. It's really good! The only drawback is that you need to have 3 base boxes to be able to build decent deck.

2016.  Great reboot of one of my favorite games.  The game still has the same solid gameplay but the game engine has been tweaked and improved for better game balance.

I don't claim to be able to give a full judgment given that I've only played this game a couple of times, but I've played quite a lot of LCGs and CCGs including the big ones such as Magic, LotR, Arkham and Android, and I must say that I actually like this one the best. I'm definitely not in the target group for these kind of games as they don't really tickle my fancy, but GoT did have a lot of good things going for it (such as the resource management as well as the card management with the three different type of actions, the plot cards etc. And I like the whole scoring mechanism in GoT; I almost always find the "race to x points" games exciting! 

So, even though I'm not a person who love these sort of games, I can still see why this game is highly regarded, and it's the best one of the LCGs so far. You should try it, even if you [are the one weird person who] haven't watched the show on HBO.

You need not one, not two, but three core-sets to do a little bit of deckbuilding... in a customizable card game! Three core-sets just for a regular (uncompetitive) 60 cards deck, that don't breaks the rules. The game is boring. Reaching 15 VP take too long. Nothing new in the game: attack and defense similar to MTG, just with three different ways and relative effects at the end of the combat. The plot deck and the pictures are the only interesting things in the game. Stay away!

[b]Includes 2nd and 3rd copy of the core set.[/b]
[b]Includes Taking the Black chapter pack.[/b]

There's a couple of layers to my anticipation and enjoyment of this game. First, I had played Magic the Gathering a good bit before getting into other modern board games. And then, I had played the first edition of A Game of Thrones: The Card game a few times... enough to know that I really enjoyed it and would likely enjoy the newer edition.

Frankly I'm fired up about this game. It takes everything I loved about MtG and improves it. The plot deck, the multifaceted aspect of making different challenges, the card interactions... it's just a wonderful design and improved in this newer version. And if you're familiar with A Game of Thrones at all, you'll appreciate how the characters and cards mirror their narrative in the story.

Where I waffle is how much to invest in this. I already own two core sets, I will likely pick up a third to produce even better "out of the box" decks to introduce players... I'm just not sure how far to go down the "chapter pack" route. That largely depends on the interest level of my local gaming group.

Pros: 1) great theme, 2) awesome artwork, 3) intriguing battles on "intrigue", "battle", "power", and "domination", 4) some bluffing aspects on strategies, 5) 3-4 players is very social, 6) similar online play options as to ANR. Cons: 1) for 2-payers, not too much more to offer compared to the combination of ANR+LotR, 2) for multi-players and backstabbing game, might just go for the board game, 3) this is not a game to just stop with one single core, to really enjoy the game you need to buy in, and it is too much to follow multiple LCGs.

I enjoy this game a lot, but it's very hard to find people interested in learning it. It's heavy for what it is, but I think it's a good thing since there are so many out there that do same thing in a less complex way.
Theme is great and it's very brutal unlike many other card games. Characters die a lot.

Love the mix between long-term strategy from plot phase and tactics coming from challenges. Game feels really thematic, characters abilities relate to their personality in the books/tv show. Eight well balanced, yet very different factions in the core set. Can't wait for the chapter packs and even more options to build my decks.

Very interesting LCG. Very thematic. Unique plot mechanics. Also, challanges that feel like a combat in three different layers or battlefields. The rest of the game feels familiar - deploying cards, playing events, etc. Deckbuilding - you may build one of 8 factions and even combine two of them together. Many meaningful choices and quite possibly the best current LCG along Netrunner.

This game should hit it's stride once expansions for all houses have been released and the card pool is up again after the reboot. An expensive prospect for some, but Agot seems to be a lifestyle game like, say, Netrunner, or Warmachine. Podcasts and news sources seem necessary as new releases and affiliated strategies sweep the player community and change the game experience for many. Sharing in a community and player content is, in itself, worth the admission to my mind. Technically satisfying, deep strategic design. Always a pleasure to play.

RATING: 5
My first impressions of this were more favorable than my later plays. Although I've only played introductory multiplayer games, there are things I don't really like about the game despite how neat the core system of rules seems to be.

1. I like the Call of Cthulhu LCG battle system better than this one.
2. Factions don't seem balanced well but that criticism is fluid depending on the state of the game.
3. Multiplayer games with the title system is an interesting way to balance ganging up on the weakest player, but this mode takes a long time to play.
4. Despite loving the theme and liking the art, I just personally didn't get into the game.

After a bit of research I find out I can't even build one decent deck with a core set nevermind actually use it to play with 4 people as stated on the box. I own several fantasy flight games and rule books often leave much to be desired but this is ridiculously vague for someone whose never played it. Perhaps it's a great game but I'll never know cause I'm not buying 2-3 core sets just so my friends and I can play. So angry it's all I can do not to throw it in my fire pit.

LCGs aren't my thing so take this with a grain of salt.  Playing with someone else's base set obviously takes a huge element out of the game, which is deckbuilding, so include that in your salt, if you will.

Mechanically speaking, this is a pretty good game of push and pull.  I never had the privilege of playing the long-running 1st edition (see above), but was tagged to play a couple of games of this to see how it feels, so I have no idea how it compares to the original.  Like any TCG, GoT is all about building the right combos to slaughter your opponent; if you have the right build, you can easily get a good engine going, but nothing is unbeatable.

In short, the game is all about getting power tokens; when you have 15, you win.  How you get them ultimately depends on how you manage your opponent(s).  Nobody is just going to let you waltz in and do power challenges unopposed... well, nobody wants to, at least.  They'll rob you of cards from your hand or your deck, kill off key characters or locations in your tableau, and if you know what's good for you, you'll work on doing the same lest you find the game over in a matter of minutes.

Cards have 1 to 3 categories of challenge abilities with a shared base strength; challenging your opponent on any one of these 3 categories is all about having more numbers than they do.  For example, a card strength of 5 with two category icons has a strength of 5 in both for the purpose of challenging either... seeing it written like that is weird, but trust me when I say it makes sense when you play.

Issues I have are the tremendous amount of counting you must do.  I'm not against doing math of any sort, but when your ultimate strategies involve mathing out potential, this game can become a slog, especially when tableaus are filled with numerous characters.  A key to managing this is to ensure that both sides are trading kills to keep the numbers low or you'll find yourselves staring into the abyss as your opponent counts out strengths for each type of challenge.  There's also the matter of complex card text - it's not that it's complicated, mind you; it's just that each card can have a multitude of conditions, triggers, abilities, etc, and keeping that all straight can be overwhelming.  These kinds of games tend to play better when the cards are kept streamlined and simple without costing depth.

Finally, I have been told that the 1st-edition multiplayer is good.  I don't know about that.  I can tell you that in this edition, multiplayer is a slog and a half.  Keep this to two players and it will be an enjoyable experience.

A great meeting of theme and mechanics. It might be more rewarding to fans of the books than the TV show (especially for Dorne). Each house has a strong thematic and strategic identity, although not as linear as the original block of L5R was. The limited release system also seems like it will prevent MtG style power-creep and unexpected interactions between cards. The agendas also add a lot to how you can design and play a deck.

This card game is probably my favorite LCG. The game design and mechanics are supertight and there are lots of tough decisions to be made, not to mention that your wonderful plan can go down the drain at any point due to an Event card played by your opponent. I shared core sets with a friend and we also share the expanions, as each of us chose four houses to keep. The one I play so far is Lannister and I am loving them. Can't wait to try other houses and deck combinations. A+ game!

This edition is even better than the first edition; there's a jumpstart on the number of cards in play, which gets the game moving faster. Cards feel streamlined. The additional hand limitation on plot cards gives you one more thing to think about. Provides a feeling that you're writing your own Game of Thrones story. There's a lot of factions in this core box, although not many cards per faction. You can play many games with the core box alone, but expect to buy more cards to get the full experience.

Excellent deck building card game with endless replayability. Unlike many card games where you simply attack with monsters to damage and kill your opponent, AGoT offers 3 type of challenges (attack): Intrigue to make your opponent discard, Military to kill your opponent's characters, and Power to steal points. When you add the Plot cards to the mix, you get a highly strategic game. Give the game a few tries before judging it; the first few games can be overwhelming with all the cards' abilities.

I wouldn't have bought this but I found it at a thrift store for a good price. I'm committed to not investing in LCG's because that is a sink-hole for cash and you really have to be dedicated to tournaments. That being said, I found enough in my first couple of games of the core set to enjoy. I like how everything works, including the Plot cards, characters, attachments, events, challenges, etc.  If there is any complaint it is that even the core set feels bloated with keywords - a problem with most CCGs. The "Learn to Play" guide is also missing some core rules which you need to look up in the rules reference. Not a huge problem, but the LtP guide should cover almost all issues that will come up in a first game.  I think there's enough fun to explore the faction decks in the base game to enjoy this. I wish buying expansion decks would add to the flavour of the game and allow for serious deckbuilding; but it really appears as if you can't build a competent deck without having 3 core sets. That's a real shame and I hate that I have to avoid expansions because they will fill my deck with too many specific cards without the leveled cards of the core. Hopefully I'll find another core set cheap someday and I can experiment with deckbuilding for personal use.

RATING: 5
Based on one play:
Meh! Too many rules for such a small game. 
To be fair - the very, very core mechanism of:
I attack you with so many units, you may defend, but it will weaken you before your own attach. How much do you want to sacrifice? What order of 3 different attacks to take to set yourself in the best position? Which cards to use, etc? It is really clever mind bugling puzzle. 
BUT! But this core mechanic is covered with an excess, with plethora of different special key-words that do this or that. What is more - if streamlined it all could've been done on the icons. Heck, maybe just CCG/LCG style of games're not for me?

And to be fair - I DO NOT LIKE the Game of Thrones theme, but it didn't bother me here.

Another solid LCG.  The 3 types of challenges put a good spin on the overused MTG mechanics of guys attacking each other.  The plot deck is brilliant.  Games can be very one sided due to limited card draw and 60 card decks.  As a result, board resets (Valar Morgulis) carry a lot of weight - too much in my opinion.

Might have to watch this to see if the streamlining all shakes out as improvements or not (after doing some reading it seems they are all small refinements and they will, but to me this is mostly a realization that the old LCG ran its course, and this is a whole new way to pull in much more $$$)

RATING: 7.5
This game was a lot of fun, even with just demo decks. I've since been looking up cards online and coming up with deck ideas. The deck construction aspect is always appealing to me, and the LCG format seems much better for my wallet than the traditional CCG model. And I think there are a lot more interesting dynamics in the play than in say magic, since the characters can attack or defend in up to three different ways, but can generally only do one on any given turn. So figuring out how to use each guy is a really interesting aspect. Though I still suspect the game isn't really something I should get into, because I know that if I spend all the time making cool decks to try then I'll just get frustrated by weird/bad draws. This is what ultimately made me realize that I was done with Magic and it's why I never really liked Dominion.

Just really not my kind of game. Super confrontational and multi-player can feel like you're picking on someone to get quick points (and visa versa). Also, seems to drag on. Also, I don't understand why people are obsessed with Game of Thrones.

Played a few times with Catsnmaths, and Beard - TBH I like it but no one else ssems to have the inclination play or time to deckbuild and play. I can see me stopping buying this soon. Which is a shame as it's really good.

28/12/16 Dropped to a 7 mainly because noone wants to play it. Also,it's VERY complex and written in FFG-legalese - I love FFGs LCGs but Boy do they need to work on their templating and clarity of rules - the whole Killed / Duped / Not killed loop made my head sad :-(

Also I think Ive decided to stop buying into it, as I never get to play it. Shame.

Aboslutely love this, will always play when the oppurtunity presents itself. In my case I have bought all the expansions for it and made a bunch of decks. It's hard to find players in my city, so it pretty much always is me getting someone to play one of my own decks against me. 
You do have to buy 3 copies of the base game to make competitive decks, and that is quite the investment. That is not a problem with all the later expansions though, as they all contain 3 (the max) of each card.

[2016.Jan.5] This is a solid & reliable LCG that plays well with multiple card-floppers (3+). It's only downside is that, although it has been revised/refactored, the game does show its age when compared to other (newer) LCGs' game mechanics.

First play was pretty terrible. It felt like it is just about who draws the good characters first. The variety of meaningful decisions was also quite limited. After some turns one player was set up fine with a ton of characters while the other couldn't do anything to improve his own situation.

This might have been an unlucky first play and there are probably strategies we are not yet aware of, that would have helped. I definetely want to try it again. However, I wonder how much fun is in actually playing the game, compared to building the decks.


Update: Played it again. Same thing happened. After some turns one player was so strong that each character the other would play, would just get killed. We ended the game early. Still wondering if we miss a rule...

Not really the right sort of game for me at this stage.

It is also difficult to introduce new players due to the complexity of the rules and the time taken to play.

This game takes MTG ideas, but divides combat into 3 areas. Gold (mana) is provided each turn by a "plot" deck. The game has a lot of math and you must contemplate several moves and scenarios each turn in order to come to the best move. I love the level of thinking this game provides.

A really nice LCG game. Second edition greatly improves on the core game. Unfortunate about all those old cards though.

Schon die erste Edition vom Game of Thrones Kartenspiel hat mir sehr viel Freude bereitet. Auf den ersten Blick gibt es bei der zweiten Edition gar nicht so viele Änderungen. Die Anleitung und Regeln lesen sich jedenfalls identisch, tatsächlich sind es die Kartentexte, die leichte Veränderungen aufweisen. Dadurch gestaltet sich das Spiel etwas flüssiger und weniger "sperrig", als noch in der ersten Edition. Trotzdem bleibt game of Thrones ein sehr komplexes und taktisch tiefgreifendes Kartenspiel. Das Artwork und die Kartenqualität ist fantastisch und schon in der ersten Grundbox sind datte 8 Fraktionen vertreten. Allerdings bis auf wenige Ausnahmen jede Karte nur einmal, so empfiehlt es sich eine zweite Grundbox zu kaufen. Dann aber hat man genügend Möglichkeiten, um sich einige spannende Decks zusammen zu stellen. Gameof Thrones warund bleibt mein persönlich liebstes Living Card Game.

Nearly identical to the first edition, except that instead of having four playable decks, you have 8 half-decks that require either a second core set or expansions to make decent decks for each house. This really bothers me that this game is sold incomplete, and my rating reflects that. There's really no reason to invest in this one over the first edition unless you prefer the new artwork or whatever. I prefer the first edition's core set for having playable decks out of the box.

Awesome game. Got into in December of 2015.  Went to two tournaments so far and mt son loves it.  A great game that we talk about for hours.

Update: 2/20/17  I quit logging my plays since this is the game I am playing most often. 

I have played at several tournaments and my son is playing as well.  He took one store championship in August of 2016, but took 9th at Regionals.  I took 17th.

He mostly plays Greyjoy/ Banner of the Wolf.

I played mostly Targaryen/Banner of the Stag.  Lately however I have had much success with Targaryen/Kings of Summer.  

February 18th I went 3-0 with my Targ/Kings of Summer deck. Made it as the #1 seed for the top 4 and lost to a Baratheon Fealty deck due to time. I believe I would have won if not for the time limit.

This LCG is okay. I like the mechanics of Netrunner much better, and the theme is non-existent to me because I have never watched the show. If someone does not have any collectible card games and loves Game of Thrones the show, then this one would definitely be a hit. For me, it's just meh... That being said, there are some cool decisions to make and I could see some pretty deep strategy, and deck building if you put the money in for the expansion packs. I give it a six because I respect the game, I just have no more room for money grabbing card games.

Rule with fire and fury as the Targareyens; rout your foes as the Greyjoys; play a game of intrigue and deceit as the Lannisters; amass a fortune as the Tyrells; reclaim the throne as the Baratheons; clash with foes as the Martells; or defend The North with the Starks and the Night Watch. Good mechanics, and one of the better franchises I enjoy. It plays like every other card game, very steep learning curve, and very deep strategy. I think I would thoroughly enjoy this game if I had access to more of the cards, but currently I only have 1 core set.

Revising rating down. Just too much cognitive load assessing the game state - our games are still taking 2.5 hours. While the core mechanics are relatively straightforward, in practice this is a heavy game that will only shine (and the play time come down) with regular matches between dedicated opponents. And to me it's just not engaging enough to take up as a lifestyle game. 

So I'm still looking for that grail of a casual duelling LCG that I can play a couple times in an evening.

The fact that i'm rubbish at this game, makes it addictive.  
Pros:Really like the theme with lots of variability.
Cons:Early days but military seems a bit over powered. 

Just played this 4 player - excellent fun!
Bumping up my rating because of the 2 player joust and 3-6 player melee just give this game extraordinary replayability and interesting combinations.

Given up Martell as a jousting deck for now.  Im sure there are ways to win, but not for me. Going Greyjoy and see how i get on.

While I am not going to get drawn into another LCG rabbithole without putting up a fight, this one seems almost to be a contender, for what felt in our play to be solid multi-player mechanisms, and of course great integration of the theme. Like the system for factions and cautiously approve of the release model ie singles in the base box, and what I understand to be mainly single-faction themed boosters - if right, that to me provides better value for the player who doesn't want to buy everything. I have no experience of the previous incarnations, and think it is fair enough for FFG to reboot on the grounds of trying to get it right whilst also capturing some of the audience of the TV show. CCGs, LCGs - they're all ultimately poisoned by the financial model and acquisition-disorder-appeal inherent in their designs, but if you can afford them and have people to play with, go for it.

This is one of the greatest card games ever designed. It's smart, tactical, and tense. It feels like A Game of Thrones should feel. I love it.

Iron Coin of the Faceless Man (Shire Post Mint)
2016 Store Championship playmat (Tyrell sewing party)

Easily one of the most fun and interesting card games. This really is A Song of Ice and Fire in a card game. Your favorite characters are in the game (or expansions) with stats that measure their might and characteristics in the books (Gregor Clegane can just wail on people). With three different ways to play cards, it adds an interesting strategic level. So much fun to play. Just typing about this game makes me want to play it. Winter is coming!

EDIT: I have the first four deluxe expansions now (Stark, Lannister, Night's Watch, and Tyrell), and all of them are excellent and a must get. This game just keeps getting better. Can't wait to have them all!

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] The reboot is great. It's nice getting all 8 factions in the core box, although it's hard to make a "legal tournament" deck with a single core.

Well done, though. They streamlined in a lot of places where it made sense, reduced the number of icons and keywords, cleaned up some timing, etc.

Got almost the whole work lunch crew invested in it and learning the game. Looking forward to following along as the card pool grows.

This game has a great theme, and I think the mechanics are pretty interesting.  The 2nd edition seems like a big upgrade over the first, though I can't say I was all that experienced with it.  I probably won't end up getting into this one either.

I'm having a hard time understanding why I'm not more excited about it.  I think it mostly comes down to how long it takes to play a game.  I'm not usually happy with a longer time investment in a game with a fair amount of luck in it.  Most CCG/LCG's that I want to play take between 5 and 30 minutes to play a game.  It seems like the average AGoT game is over an hour.

I am thoroughly impressed. This game marries theme and mechanics in such a beautiful way. It really feels like the source material. It's swingy, loads of things are going on, heads are chopped, people are sent to the wall. You read a card, and then laugh: "hah, of course Tyrion would do that" or "damn, that's just like Cersei". Every faction has a distinct feel and play style, giving loads of replayability. Excellent game.

This game is a masterpiece. You can tell that there has been 7+ years of extensive playtesting. For a competitive LCG, the rules are incredibly streamlined. I have yet to run into a question that wasn't quickly answered by the rulebook.

The theme is great. Each house plays differently, and the abilities elegantly reflect each character. Some houses are better at military challenges (Starks), some are better at intrigue (Lannisters), some are sneaky (Greyjoy), and some just want to watch the world burn (Targeryan).

What really makes the game shine is the plot deck. So many competitive card games have flawed resource systems (I'm looking at you Magic), or fairly mundane resources like 1 per turn. Game of Thrones is fantastic because each turn you choose a plot from your deck of 7 cards. The plots determine how much gold you get and who goes first, but also how effective your challenges are and they provide different effects. I'd wager half of the strategy revolves around which plots you put in your deck and when you choose them. But then the challenges phase is also incredibly strategic, because there are 3 different options and the order can make a huge difference.

Right now the deckbuilding is fairly limited, but it's pretty amazing how much game play they crammed into the core set. You can pair at most two factions, which I think is good to limit ridiculous decks.

I've enjoyed my joust (2 player) plays, but everyone says Melee (multiplayer) is even better and captures the theme even better. So there is a chance my rating will improve with time. However, I'm not excited about keeping up with two LCGs and I don't like the concept of chasing the meta, as happens in all competitive LCG/CCGs. So there's also a chance I'll stop buying packs and be forced to stop competing.

One of my absolute favorite games to play! I'm a huge Song of Ice and Fire fan, and feel like this game captures the theme and mood of that world very well! The mechanics of the game create such a large amount of variety for strategies and planning for victory. Once you get into the world of deckbuilding, a player can really begin to craft strategies to win the way they want. Its so easy to get drawn into the theme of it all. Any Song of Ice and Fire fan will enjoy playing this game.

I am absolutely obsessed with George RR Martin's 'A Song of Ice and Fire' novels. Prior to the fall of 2015, I had not played a CCG/TCG/etc. since I was a middle schooler (some 15 years ago). The perfect storm brewed, where a member of my weekly gaming group was picking up the 2nd edition of a card game based on one of my favorite IPs. I took the plunge at launch and have fallen in love with the game. It's super thematic, the graphic design is outstanding, and the "plot" deck adds some neat structure to the game.

I don't play often enough to make waves on the competitive scene, which is sort of a shame because many of the best players in the world live in the same town as I do, but I enjoy reading up on spoilers from future packs and trying to exploit rules by building wonky decks.

I wasn't sure whether to include this or not because all of my plays have been on OCTGN, but the game is the same so I figure it counts. For a little background, I have played Magic a fair amount and dabbled in a few other CCGs, but this is my first non-Magic dive into a competitive card game. I'm fully invested in The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game and I love the LCG model. I never played the first edition of aGoT, but I played the HBO 2 player version once.

En Juego de Tronos: El Juego de Cartas, las facciones enfrentadas de Poniente espera de su comando, que le invita a participar en una lucha a vida o muerte. En cada juego, selecciona parcelas tortuosos y desafiar a sus oponentes en el campo de batalla, a través de la intriga callejón, y en la arena política. Si usted juega una contra un solo oponente, en un juego conocido como una justa, o participar en una batalla de tres o más jugadores, llamado un cuerpo a cuerpo, ganando desafíos contra sus oponentes es el camino a la victoria.

Su objetivo final en Juego de Tronos: El Juego de Cartas es ganar la mayor influencia sobre el asiento de la energía en Poniente: el Trono de Hierro! Para lograr este objetivo, es necesario recurrir a personajes icónicos, como Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Ojo de Cuervo, La Víbora Roja, y docenas de otros. Debe maniobrar los miembros de su casa y sus aliados en una batalla constante para alcanzar el poder. El primer jugador con la reivindicación quince victorias de energía!

En el juego, cada jugador tiene dos cubiertas: un mazo de cartas y un mazo de Trama. Tu mazo de cartas contiene los elementos tácticos de su lucha, incluyendo los personajes, localizaciones, archivos adjuntos y los eventos que se invocan en su lucha para reclamar el Trono de Hierro. Puede ordenar los caracteres de largo de Canción de Hielo y Fuego, y se puede marchar adelante de las paredes heladas de Invernalia o reunir sus ejércitos alrededor de Roca Casterly. Usted puede incluso equipar a sus personajes con armas pisos, como el valyriano cuchillas de acero hielo o Wail de la viuda. El mazo de cartas tiene estos poderosos personajes, lugares, archivos adjuntos y eventos. Esto cartas se barajan al azar y los jugadores saquen sus manos de esta cubierta.

Al comienzo de cada ronda, cada jugador elige de forma simultánea y revela una de las tarjetas de la trama de la trama de su mazo de siete cartas individuales. Su parcela para una ronda determina la cantidad de oro que puede gastar en tarjetas, el jugador que comienza con iniciativa, y lo poderoso que sus retos son. Su trama también tiene un valor de reserva, el cual determina la cantidad de cartas que puede tener en la mano más allá del final de la ronda. Parcelas también pueden ofrecer efectos de gran alcance que pueden desencadenar cuando se revelan las parcelas o persistir para dar forma a toda la ronda de juego. Usted puede quemar a la tierra con un asalto mortal incendio forestal, ni invocar a todos los jugadores para apoyar la fe de los Siete.

Juego de Tronos: El Juego de Cartas (Segunda Edición) difiere de la primera edición del juego debido a los elementos que se están cortando, los elementos que se revisen o actualicen, y se añadió elementos. Influencia era un vestigio de origen del juego como un CCG y ahora es innecesaria, mientras que las crestas ofrecieron nada para distinguirlos de los rasgos y hacen el juego más difícil para los nuevos jugadores aprendan. las palabras clave existentes han sido podadas, y se han añadido algunas palabras clave nuevas para mostrar las interacciones más interesantes y esenciales.

Las reglas de tiempo - como los detalles de los efectos moribundos, pasivo con disparadores, y guardar / cancelar las respuestas - serán reemplazados con un sistema de cronometraje más sencillo que se aprovecha de la interrupción, la reacción y los factores desencadenantes que se han empleado con éxito en algunos forzado de nuevas GLCs de FFG.

La segunda edición también incluye dos nuevas facciones más allá de las seis casas en la primera edición. Nuevas reglas de construcción de mazo facultan a los jugadores con más opciones en la combinación de las facciones, junto con un medio para la construcción de cubiertas de la trama más especializados y bien orientados.

I'm disappointed by this one, the new edition is fine, artwork is good, gameplay is smooth, the characters/theme are well integrated, but I wish a core set would offer some deck-building opportunities. as it is, you only get one of each card, so goodbye duplicate characters, goodbye constructing a deck around a few repeated cards, lot's of luck in the draw, it's more like a SmashUp GoT (pick 2 factions and smash them up to create a deck). I really don't want to invest $ in this so I'll pass.

[+] I can see an interesting gameplay, many options for deck-building but you need to invest massively for that (3 core sets at least); theme, artwork, rules are fine.
[-] a core set is good for a demo but not enough to make it a fun, customisable, replayable game. too bad.

RATING: 7
This is a fantastic game, that feels different than every other card game out there and also manages to feel like a fair representation of the Game of Thrones setting. Political struggles, betrayals and straight up open combat happen every turn and always shifts the balance of power between the player factions. It works equally well with three or four players as it does with two, which is quite an oddity in the world of CCG/TCG/LCG's.

All that being said, it is a hard game to play well. It breaks almost every convention of typical "dueling" card games. As a result, you have to be able to math out attacks and counter attacks in three arenas, sometimes a turn or two in advance. This isn't a complaint...I think it is what makes this such an amazing game. But it's also the thing that is going to prevent me from buying into it. I simply don't have time to give it the kind of attention it demands to be able to play well.

in other words, if you are light on other gaming commitments and you love the Game of Thrones, buy this right now. It's fantastic. If you already dabble in Netrunner, Magic and Doomtown Reloaded...then keep on walking. This one is way too involved to play casually.

I’m a fan of card games, and I’ve played a lot of Netrunner, but I’m always willing to try a new one. When my friend came to play Blood Rage, he also brought A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) so we tried out a three player game. I really like that the game even supports multiplayer (unlike Netrunner), but three players might not be the best count as the best play in some rounds was to do nothing. In other words, it was really easy to overextend yourself in the three player game. My other issue is likely one of inexperience: it feels really swingy. I’m sure with more plays it wouldn’t feel that way.

I guess I’d be happy to play more of this game, but it would be third on the list after 1) Netrunner and 2) Warhammer 40,000: Conquest.

This is technically the 3rd version of the game, and it shows.   FFG has refined the mechanics and polished the gameplay until it shines.   Easily one of the most engaging card games I have ever played.

And the price is a steal.   Yes, you have to buy 3 core sets to have a full "base set" but that's still less than a full set of an CCG out there.  A LOT less.

One of the best card games I have ever played. I didn't feel as if the economy of the game was preventing me from playing what I wanted at any time (unlike other card games like Netrunner, Magic, etc). The plot deck is perfect for keeping that in check and adds additional effects that alter the curse of the game. 

The 8 factions from the core set play really different and are really thematic. There's a strategy for everyone: control, burn, aggro, defend, stall, etc.. and the new packs are increasing the options exponentionally. I can remember the last time I had so much fun deckbuilding and testing decks. The community is also really friendly.

Those who hate deckbuilding shouldn't be worried either as the Core set comes with 4 really balanced preconstructed decks that pack hours of 2-4 fun.

The best part is that the game can be played in a 3-6 multiplayer format that really feels you are playing the Game of Thrones.

To summerize, I really love it!

The theme takes this game a long way, the mechanisms within the game can feel reminiscent of the show with a bit of imagination it's possible to weave a Game of Thrones narrative through card play which is enjoyable. That's about the level I'd like to keep this game at, casual play, rather than digging into tournament play. There's a hell of a lot to explore within the collection we currently own and if we were to not pick up anything beyond the cards we own I'm sure we could enjoy this for many more games, if we find time to play it that is! Like with all these head to head card games it is harder to get the reps in when you only have one regular opponent.

Truly a fantastic cardgame, or game period, for the following reasons:

1. Cool mix between long-term strategy (plot phase) and tactics (challenges phase).
2. Resources are (mostly) not influenced by the luck of the draw.
3. Three different fronts of "combat", both interesting and thematic.
4. Eight different factions which all play very differently and are extremely well balanced at the same time.
5. It's the Game of Thrones, the only game that matters. The interpretation and adaption of the source material is terrific.

Az első komolyabb LCG amibe belevágtam, de úgy tűnik, egyelőre nem bántam meg. Nekem picit bonyolultnak tűnt elsőre, de csak a rutin hiányzott, egyáltalán nem megtanulhatatlan a dolog. (szerk.: igen, a 2-3. játékra bőven összeáll minden, csak sok mindenre kell figyelni inkább az elején, nem bonyolult maga a játék)

Erősen nyelvfüggő és szokni kell pár kifejezést, de a játék kárpótol, nagyon hangulatos az egész. Amit még érdemes tudni róla, hogy az alapdoboz tartalmazza az összes házat, de korlátozott lapokkal, így a teljes élményhez két alapdoboz szükséges. Játszható eggyel is ettől függetlenül, de ha komolyabban gondoljuk, akkor ezzel számolni kell. ( Sőt, versenyhez 3 alapdoboz kell, de ezen most lépjünk túl. :) ) (Szerk2.: Túlléptem, vettem még két alapdobozt. :D )

Pár meccs után egyértelműen feljebb is kell pontoznom, ez egy nagyon jó játék.

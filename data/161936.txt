Awesome game for a play through. Good successor to Risk Legacy. The linear plot & co-opness keep it from having the same heights, but it also has a very high floor. Recommended for everyone.

RATING: 7
A fantastic spin on the traditional Pandemic experience. Without spoiling anything, there are a number of changes that occur throughout the game that I think give it a fresh enough experience that should give even the seasoned Pandemic player something new to tinker with (and that's well appreciated). In particular, I think the Legacy system is really well suited for this sort of endeavor and in the event of a sequel, I wouldn't hesitate to pick it up. If nothing else, to get 15-25 games out of a boardgame which ran about $55 isn't bad. The opportunity cost itself works out to a series of evenings which have wondrous and fresh experiences, even if they do seem familiar. This is one of the few games which really ventures into new territory without dropping the replay value considerably (e.g. TIME Stories).

On that note, there are some problems which I think exist here that Pandemic doesn't normally exhibit. First, we find that the game is sort of tied to a group of people so if you find yourself gaming with larger groups and different people each week/month/session then this becomes a much more difficult sell. Second, while the game's Legacy component does overcome some of my problems with how Pandemic became stale, ultimately this game will come to an end, and when it does, it's less attractive than normal Pandemic as the expansions aren't intended for this (but someone might be able to finagle it, who knows).  So while I do like this more than regular Pandemic (at this time rated a 6) for the exhilarating romp through a new disease evolution which is unlike most other games, ultimately it's going to end and fall over to the memory pile so I find it difficult to rate it a 9 or 10 when it's not expected to live past the number of iterations or time span that my other favorites have. Second, it's not a game I can suggest for just anyone, it requires a certain group to play (although, with the right group, one of the fall months can be super funny).  Finding a rating on BGG sort of implies some sort of replay-ability, and after 16 games of it, I'm glad to be done. In that regard, I think P:L is a comfortable 7, maybe a strong 6.

This game starts okay, gets great, and then ends stale. Because my group was left with no desire to play season two I cannot give this a great rating. It has some high moments but the end was a boring sit-and-wait game of drawing cards and that just isn't fun game design

RATING: 8
I had a lot of fun playing this game. The story was great and I enjoyed the way the game evolved over time. 

I was frustrated by my own rules mistakes (many many) which began almost immediately and I never felt like I played a full game without mistakes. (In a normal game you would get these rules bloopers ironed out over time.) I was also frustrated by things that didn't seem as clear to me as I would have liked. 

I would still highly recommend the game, just pay super close attention to all the rules, especially the changes.

It's good, but not mindblowing yet. I can appreciate that I'm only a quarter of the way through the campaign. At the end of the day, it's still Pandemic -- but I'm playing it with people I love, so there's a plus.

Brilliant game that I both was enamored by and wish I had more fun playing. I found it to be a little on the easy side, although it never once got dull. I don't enjoy leaving games out on the table for an extended period of time (very limited space), and I know I would've enjoyed playing more with a different group of people. Too bad it can't be replayed.

RATING: 1
Three things: 1. I love Pandemic 2. I love Legacy games where the game state changes across plays 3. I'm not concerned that you can't play again once you've finished. So why have I rated this a 1? Because for me and my fellow player the game turned out to be broken. Three quaters of the way through a card was revealed that contains, with hindsight, ambiguous instructions. We followed these and ended up some plays later, in a terrible position. We were then presented with something new that made no sense so we checked the internet and discovered the card was intended to be read in another way. By this time we couldn't reasonably undo prior plays and there was no point continuing. So we abandoned it before the end with great disappointment. If we'd read the card the way it was intended I think it would have lead to an exciting conclusion. Very surprised this didn't come up in play testing, and we aren't the only ones this has happened to. So very disappointing for us. I've avoided going into any detail so as not to provide spoilers.

RATING: 9
Jan (win) : 2p.  Like Pandemic with extras.  Looking forward to the rest of this.  We were cruising to an easy win, but I guess we didn't shuffle enough because most of the blue cards ended up on the bottom, which delayed us finishing off the scenario for a couple of turns and made the ending tighter than it should have been.

Feb (loss) : We added an additional character to up the difficulty a bit.  It came down to the wire, but getting 3 epidemic cards in fairly quick succession were too much for us to stop.

Feb (win) : We got ahead of things early and cruised to an easy victory.

March (win) : We had three outbreaks towards the end, but still won fairly easily.  We have a very strong combo going through our characters and their upgrades/relationships.  After playing, I realized that we made it harder for ourselves by meeting all three objectives.

April (win) : We won, but the board got pretty ugly by the end with 6 outbreaks.  The plot twist was great!  Really looking forward to the rest of this.

May (loss) : Rough initial card draw, although we got ahead of things and nearly won.  Our combo is great for curing diseases but not so great for controlling cubes.

May (loss) :  I suggested to my wife that we switch up our characters and change up our strategy.  She was having none of it.  We lost again, but it was close.  We met two objectives and were very close to completing a third for the win.

June (win) : Won in an absolute nail-biter.  My wife agreed to switch up our characters/strategy for this one.  This has been my favourite month so far.  Great game and can't wait to see what the second half has to offer!  The state of our board isn't looking good since we've had a lot of outbreaks.  We've definitely made a few rules mistakes here and there.  I've tried to correct them when possible but I figure we've come out about even with rules errors helping/hurting us.

July (win) : This was a fairly easy win.  Favourable initial card draw for our super combo to come out.  The new mechanic that was added this month wasn't super interesting in my opinion.  I'm hoping that whatever is added next is better.

August (loss) : We got absolutely crushed.  Our three previous losses were close and came down to the wire, but this was one of those Pandemic games where the luck of the draw crushes you.

August (win) : This was the opposite of early August...a cake walk.

September (win) : Wow!  Crazy twist, but still a fairly comfortable win.

Unbalanced and too easy at 2. Fun although 3/4 of that is opening the chests/dossier. At the end of the day it's better than vanilla Pandemic, but it's still in that universe and I could care less about the theme. It is a good game, and a great experience. But I'm not breaking down the door to continue our campaign

As of this writing we are approximately halfway through the campaign. At this point I feel that the game is really about playing the same Pandemic scenario over and over again. The Legacy thing just adds new game mechanics and rules after every round. And the pace at which the game evolves is fast. At first the changes felt exciting and opening the boxes and dossiers was like Christmas. Now I already feel like I couldn't care less. There is a tsunami of rule breaking exceptions flooding out of every box and it is very difficult to maintain interest in learning all of them properly. Your choices do not seem to affect the future too much. In other words, there are apparent no one way doors that would really make you agonize over your decisions.

The game looks absolutely gorgeous though.

2016-11-10
With three quarters of the game cleared I have to say that Pandemic Legacy achieves to do something many other co-ops do not. At least in our group there has been no single dominant alpha player. Instead the experience has truly been a co-operative one. Ironically this is due the fact nobody has been able to maintain interest in the events all the time.

Finally the first ghosts from the past have started to emerge as your earlier decisions begin to have at least some accumulated effect on the outcome of a month. Moreover, the mystery behind the background story has started to unravel. In my opinion it is quite late for this story arc to develop as the early to mid-game is more or less predictable basic stuff. 

I still do not think this is a bad game and I definitely want to play this through. But at the same time I am eager to finish.

2016-11-17
4 months, 7 sessions, 19 games and 20-25 hours (depending on whether you include the time spent on setting up and cleaning). That is how long it took for us to finish the whole campaign. Was it worth it? Hard to say. The game had its moments but in the end, it was still the same Pandemic over and over again. My primary motivation to keep playing stemmed from Pandemic Legacy being the current No. 1 rated game on BGG and as a boardgame hobbyist I felt obliged to go through the experience myself. 

In some games we had really really bad luck (the quickest defeat came in six turns) while in other games we felt invincible right from the start. So, the spectrum of luck in the game can be quite wide. We finished the game with a score of 541 points which I would guess to be close to the average. This is also in line with my gut feeling that we had average luck.

That being said, my final thought about the game is that our actions had little to no effect on the final outcome as our month-to-month success was mostly dictated by the luck of draw. Of course, the upgrades we chose during the game made the following months easier but still I did not once think that we had any kind of decisive edge over the fate that was shuffled into the two decks of cards. Perhaps the last two months were an exception when our highly debated decisions in November actually allowed us to win December in the nick of time. 

The standard BGG rating system clearly does not work with legacy games. I do not have any desire to play Pandemic Legacy ever again because it is a one time experience. This would be in line with a rating of 3-4. However, at the same time the game works well because it has the same tested and proved Pandemic mechanics running under the hood. Thus the game should be rated a SIX. In the end, I think I am more inclined to rate Pandemic Legacy a FIVE. I did not find the legacy mechanic to enhance the game enough to justify a playing time of 25 hours. This is primarily because your decisions do not alter the course of the game enough and there is only one way to finish the campaign. At the moment, I'd rather play a 60min game of the original Pandemic than commit to playing Season 2 for another 25 hours. However, I fear the latter is inevitable...

Two plays in and so far, so good.  To make the most of the game, I am writing session reports about each of our plays.  You can read them [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/blogcategory/3750/pandemic-legacy]here[/url].  WARNING: Those reports are heavy on spoilers.

So far, it feels like base game Pandemic, but even within the first game it began to feel like a different beast.  Just knowing that decisions you make in one game will have lasting repercussions changes the way you think about and play the game.

I'm looking forward to finding out what happens next!

My wife and I love Pandemic but couldn't grasp the continuity of this game given the core games principles.  If you lose, the game makes it easier, and easier to the point where you open a box that completely cheats the game by eliminating epidemics.  Throw in the continuing complexity of the rules month by month and the introduction of zombies, I feel that there are other parts of the game that are broken. or I actually threw the game in the trash after a month 3 loss but pulled it out when my wife reminded me it was a birthday gift and that we should at least finish it given the money spent (she knows I am a cheap SOB).  So, yeah, we love Pandemic and look forward to getting "On the Brink" when it is released again but I don't ever see myself playing a legacy game again given the once playthrough and the strange, complex gameplay.

I was so excited to see the Legacy system applied to a game that isn't Risk, and it's every bit as awesome as I'd hoped.

I don't yet know if there's replay value after the main sequence is complete, but after what just happened in our most recent game, I don't even care.  Pandemic Legacy has already given me tension, excitement, joy, and shock that I've never felt in another game, and I'm bumping it up from 9 to 10 as a result.  This is my third 10 ranking ever.

Update:  We've finished our season 1 play-through, and I'm very confident in my 10 rating.  I don't expect to keep playing this copy, but it was so much fun that I'm okay with that.  I recommend this game to everyone, and I'll buy season 2 without a second thought.

I like this game.  Pandemic is a nice game that is easy to teach, so it has made numerous appearances at the table.  My personal opinion is the legacy idea really helps Pandemic shine, giving any game a story is a huge benefit.  I love progression and variety, the plot really shines here.  However the added complexity is an actual downside to my family as we've gone from month to month.  I'm a wargamer so this game is not complicated to me, but I understand that it's bothersome to suddenly stop a game mid-session and read off 3-4 new rules and sort through some new game components.

Anyway I applaud what the designers have done here.  They've taken a decent game and created a wonderful game experience.  I won't rate this higher because once I've finished my 12 or so games, it's done and can't be repeated (without buying another set).  I'm very happy to share this game with my family, but I'm definitely not looking for more Legacy style games in my collection.

Postmortem: Well it took about 18 months but my family finished season one.  We liked it enough that we picked up season two, but I stand by the seven rating.  Now that I've finished season one, I never want to play that season again.  The experience was good, we could've played better (or had help from certain events), but nevertheless we know the story and there's no need to go back through it.  It feels weird to look at a game and think about just trashing it.  I'll hold onto the map as a keepsake, but everything else goes.

Great couple game. Cool legacy mechanic, it's fun to discover the new game material. Game complexity increases over time. The rules become more complex over time.

Was great fun for our group of 4 spread across 3 days of 6-8 play sessions each.  Improves on the basic Pandemic formula (which I'm not really a fan of) and breathes life into it with a story, stakes, and constant rule changes as the story progresses, giving you a slightly different game each round.  The damage caused by failing in a given month will carry over into future rounds and you're scored on your overall success at the end.  Enjoyed it and would definitely play it again with another group.

Don't let anyone who has a problem with "consumable games" talk you out of buying this one ... it is a fantastic game.  If you like Pandemic, this game is a must ... but only if you can get 3 or 4 people to play the entire campaign through with you.  The game can be found, now that is over a year old, for less than $50 so you can count on about 15-20 plays, for an hour or so each, for that price.  

Find it, buy it, play it, enjoy it!

Overhyped. If you LOVE Pandemic and play it regularly, this is going to blow your socks off, but it's not the end-all-be-all of gaming that it's been presented as. If you're already tired of base Pandemic then this is just going to be ~20 more games of that with some extra mechanisms thrown in. The Legacy content is more interestingly different than in Risk Legacy, but also less exciting.

We haven't started the campaign yet, so this review is for the original Pandemic. 

This is one of the few games that if we loose, my husband will be willing to play again. So that tells a lot about how great this game is for us. I cannot wait to find a couple of friends to start the campaign with us.

I definitely love this game!

RATING: 4

1st plays: This is a much better version of Pandemic than the original, because the little decisions that you can ignore in pursuit of the greater victory suddenly become meaningful.  I rate the normal Pandemic at a 5 or a 6, and this game is better.  So far though, the game hasn't lived up to the hype - it's interesting but not even close to the best game ever.

2nd play: The game continues to heat up with new objectives, additional player powers and a brutal infection deck.  It's still Pandemic though.  It probably replaces base pandemic for me, and I'm happy to play it, but it ends up being just ok.  I don't understand all the love it's getting, but maybe when we get to May or June I'll come to understand.

Ok, at the start it is exactly like Pandemic, but on the progress we've made the game is about to change a lot. I won't evaluate it proper until we finish our campaign, but it is a solid game for the ones who enjoy Pandemic. I liked the Legacy system a lot, it is really cool the way things get delivered to players as the game progress.

This is not Pandemic, this is a fantastic adventure stuffed in a box which starts out as just Pandemic, but becomes SO much more. The story, the abundance of choices, the ripping apart of cards, the stickers... It all adds up and becomes a great game, if not one of the best games I've ever played.

Played with a dedicated group over several months. Didn't like it quite as much as Risk Legacy but I think that's because I prefer the base game of Risk to the base game of Pandemic. Still a great experience though, with some great reveals.
On board for season 2 and whatever legacy games come out in the meantime.

I was enjoying this game, then it UNDESERVINGLY stole Twilight Struggle's throne with 1/6 of the votes (and a deliberate sabotage campaign)...

and then September happened. So in pure spite of Pandemic Legacy getting to #1, let me just say...

˙ɯǝɥʇ ǝƃɐʇoqɐs oʇ ɯɐǝʇ ɹᴉǝɥʇ uo ɹoʇᴉɐɹʇ ɐ pǝʇuɐld puɐ 'ʇɐoƃǝdɐɔs ɔᴉlqnd ɐ sɐ ƆpƆ ǝɥʇ ƃuᴉsn ǝɹɐ puɐ sǝᴉqɯoz pǝpɐɟ ɐpoɔ ǝɥʇ pǝɹǝǝuᴉƃuǝ-oᴉq ʎɹɐʇᴉlᴉɯ ǝɥ┴

Oh, did I forget to put "spoiler" in front of that? Silly me. 

Maybe I'm also pissed that this game screwed us over completely in our campaign (see below). And a co-op as #1 means that inferior games will now get all the attention, as if there wasn't already a critical mass of dilettantes in the hobby who only want to play Catan, Ticket to Ride, and maybe Lords of Waterdeep if you're "lucky."  

Oh, and we predicted the Big Twist way back in the May campaign game, so it was pretty lame that it wasn't more creative. 

But the reason I got so pissed and decided to spoil it is because our game is now BASICALLY UNWINNABLE:

[i]2017/05/15 - 9 plays 4 players - 6 victories[/i]

First legacy game I play, some conclusions:
- you need to really like the base game, because you are going to play it a lot. Fortunately, I like Pandemic.
- Because the ruleset evolves from one session to another, you really need to play regularly, otherwise you have to relearn the whole ruleset before a play.
- PL is the kind of legacy game that requires all players to attend each play. You could play without someone, but that would severely affect the experience (this is different for instant to Gloomhaven). As a result, we tend to play 1 game per month on average.

Otherwise great game, the campaign aspects definitely raises the stakes, and the legacy element gives a touch of finality to what happens. One of the players even had nightmares after the first play (a defeat).

As a result you pay a lot more of attention and give more thought to a play of PL than a play of Pandemic. I often was thinking about strategy before starting the game, which is great sign.

The funding system helps to regulate difficulty level of the campaign. So far our performance is within the difficulty range of the system, so the game was not too hard or too difficult for us. Very nice.

This is a great experience for Pandemic lovers, if you can keep a group playing the same game over a couple of months.

The Legacy concept is simply brilliant: you start with a small set of rules which is constantly increased during the "year", and the fact that the game keeps changing puts you in a constant state of suspense. Moreover, the materials are of excellent quality.
Having said that, it is not at all the best board game out there. Not by far. Too simple, and the sessions last waaaaay not enough. If you are a seasoned player you can finish a game in 30 minutes or so, which, considered the high price and that you can play it up to 24 times, it leaves you with a feeling of unsatisfaction. Having said that, I cant wait to buy and play Season 2...

Rather Overhyped. The game itself is meh and too easy, the "story" is... "ok". The only really funny about this game is the naming of people / deseases and the nuclear option (we put it under a glass, and when someone would touch it would trigger) which provided a sort of (politcally incorrect and weird) story on its own. Yet still, we only played 8 missions or something and haven´t played since because no one is really that interested or would propose playing it.(over a year now)
Destroying game material is also kinda fun.

Pandemic is one of the best cooperative games, and the legacy version is much better.  The legacy format synergizes so well with the co-op aspect; your play group will bond as you work through the changes on the board and repeatedly experience the thrill of opening new boxes of components/rules.  If the last few months of play are a bit less exciting (they repeat a mechanic that gets a bit boring) than the first half of the game, it's only because those first six months are about as great a game experience as you can have.

Un juego muy chulo: Super temático y sobre todo innovador. Un juego que ha marcado tendencias, como en su día lo hicieron otros. No ha sido el primero en usar el sistema legacy, pero si que ha sido el primero en hacerlo de manera rompedora.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I'm not particularly a fan of Pandemic. The base game feels like you could usually do anything you want for 90% of the game, and your actions are basically a randomizer for the last round of the game when you finally need to coordinate with the team a bit. It's fine, but there are other cooperatives that I think are more interesting to play.

I was hoping that Legacy would:

1) Add story
2) Fix the above issue

For the first, I would say...not really. You could probably fit all of the story text that goes into the game on one side of a single sheet of regular sized paper, in regular 12 point font. Stretched over 12-24 games, that's just not enough to be worth calling story. TIME Stories gives you more story text in a single play than all of Pandemic: Legacy, and TIME Stories puts 70% of their story in pictures, not words.

There's one major change to the map pretty early on and, after that, not much changes. The map change, once dealt with, no longer really effects how you play the game by very much for the rest of the campaign. So it's really only 1 or 2 plays, out of the 12-24 which feel like something different is happening. The other 90% feel like ordinary Pandemic.

A couple of times a side quest is thrown in after the map change, but the mechanism that the side quests use (which is reused for each instance) isn't terribly interesting, so I sort of discount that from the above statement.

As to the second want, an improvement to the cooperative aspect, it's hard to tell. A couple of times the game would slam us and force us to lose. It's unclear whether that was an aspect of the difficulty ramping up after a rule change or simply that we got unlucky with the ordering of the deck and the timing of epidemics. If the former, then I suppose it does occasionally jump out of its comfortable, overly-scripted game flow. But I suspect that regular Pandemic does the same thing, and I've simply not played it enough times to encounter the effect.

On the whole, I'd say that if you love Pandemic, then you might enjoy the tweaks that occur as you play this version. But it feels more like a few mini-expansions (with an emphasis on the "mini") and rules variants thrown into a box of regular Pandemic, than it feels like an unfolding story or anything different than you're used to from the base game.

Go for it if you love Pandemic. Don't worry about what you're missing if you don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
While it's streaking up the charts, let's be clear that this isn't one of the very best games of all time. It IS, however, one of the best gaming EXPERIENCES of all time. The manner in which is extends and adds tension to the base pandemic experience is incredible, but so much of what makes it great is playing it with the same group and watching your individual experience unfold, discussing strategy and character choice and upgrades, celebrating the close wins and mourning the tough losses...the legacy format has legs and it is HERE to stay, and it is glorious. Those who can't fathom tearing up cards, prepare to weep.

After a campaign: without spoilers, I feel that the storytelling got pretty lazy late in the game, and it definitely ended with a whimper not a bang. Still awesome, but the next big legacy game (seafall?) is going to take over this #1 spot potentially (the pandemic brand might be the difference maker)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Although it started off strong, the constant use of set collection and the cards that railroads you into playing it linearly makes this take on legacy disappointing.

They did a good job with the new characters and scars, but just about everything else is as forgettable as any old set collection co-op.

RATING: 7.5
Puff. The game is good. I wasn't really sold on Pandemic before jumping to this game and the experience was great. I won't rate the experience of playing with the same people every few weeks until ending the season, even though it was really good.

If you already like Pandemic, this is a must. If you are interested in the campaign aspect, opening new content and shape your own map, you should look at this game. If you dislike Pandemic and you expect to play a way different game, look elsewhere. This game is and will be Pandemic with some minor or not so minor differences depending on the month.

It's not perfect. It's not the best game of all time. But it can be a great experience.

Now, my biggest critizism about the game are spoiler, so I'll tag them and strongly advise anyone to not read it if they think they'll play the game.

[o]The game has an anticlimatic final which kinda deteriorates the rest of the campaign. How well you did,
 count points, all posible epilogues are in one face of a card.
The plot twist is not very surprising, but ingame is way worse. Turn 2 one of our players was a civilian because of a random even any of us had control. It could have been done better, giving clues about the potential risk of the upgrade or something.
The story doesn't have ramifications. You have no decisions on all the story, you are just on your railroad until the end of the campaing where you will have one ending or another.
And having every search up to date, losing twice the same month and having some deux ex machina soldiers solving our mission when we only had that month to complete the last one(and was imposible due to bad luck) was terrible. And it wouldn't be relevant until the end of the game,
 where you will find that it doesn't matter any of your previous searches, because we could had ignored them all and the points would have been the same. And the difference is pretty big, we got the 3th one and would have ended with the best result if we could have finish that last search.

So yeah, until August, I would have rated this game with a 9. Liked September, but the final three months were a huge dissapointment. December was kinda cool, but not after seeing what a shitty way had the game to end.

A very recommended experience, but I think 7.5 is a fair rating. The game could have been so much better with a better finale and adding more player agency to the story in the final months.[/o]

Addictive but ultimately unsatisfying version of pandemic I quite like the base game although I find it too easy.

RATING: 7
It's good, but it's not the best game ever made.

The legacy doesn't so much feel like a story so much as a series of consecutive games of Pandemic that get more cluttered with rules, stickers and tokens the further on you go.

Part of the reason for this feeling of distance to the story is that it is a cooperative game. As such, each person is playing exactly the same story, as dictated by the alpha player. So the games happens at you and, win or lose, you don't really feel like you made any decisions of consequence to the story.

Right now, my eagerness to get to the next game is overshadowed by my keen addiction to another legacy game that I'm currently working through, Seafall. I would say that, because Seafall is PvP and each person can play how they want, the story feels so much more personal and immersive.

RATING: 9.5
Fantastic so far, through April. Take Pandemic, but add a chaperoned story. It's amazing and worth the hype.

Edit: Finished the game in 16 plays (plus one ghost play that we ended up resetting because I forgot to open a box). In the end, it was excellent and I am even thinking about playing again. The middle rounds (from June to October ish) are a little flat, with not much new coming out, but some of the twists in the final three months are amazing and were great moments. Reading the November mission briefing was an amazing "holy crap" moment. Excellent all around.

Πάμε και στο πολυβραβευμένο Pandemic Legacy. Έχει βάση όλος αυτός ο χαμός και το hype? Να πω αρχικά πως ενώ μου αρέσουν πολύ τα συνεργατικά παιχνίδια, δεν είμαι φαν της απλής πανδημίας καθώς την βρίσκω αρκετά απλή και σχετικά παρωχημένη σαν συνεργατικό παιχνίδι. Παρόλα αυτά ήθελα να ολοκληρώσω όλη την campaign του Legacy ώστε να έχω πιο σφαιρική άποψη.  

Δεν θέλω να spoilάρω το τι συμβαίνει στο παιχνίδι οπότε θα είμαι λίγο γενικός αλλά θα πω πως αρχικά ξεκινάει σαν την απλή πανδημία και σιγά σιγά αλλάζει κάθε μήνα του campaign. Δεν έχω παράπονο από την παραμετροποίηση. Μπορείς να πειράξεις τον χάρτη, να αναβαθμίσεις τους χαρακτήρες να ξεκλειδώσεις καινούργιους, να επηρεάσεις τις ασθένειες, τις κάρτες της τράπουλας, καινούργια components μπαίνουν στο παιχνίδι, αλλάζουν τα actions, και άλλα πολλά. Το παιχνίδι δεν σε αφήνει σε ησυχία και συνεχώς πετά νέες προκλήσεις. :) 
 
Τα παράπονα μου έχουν να κάνουν περισσότερο με το backstory του παιχνιδιού και συγκεκριμένα με την μη δυνατότητα να επηρεάσεις την εξέλιξη του. Η υπόθεση θα προχωρήσει όπως είναι γραμμένη να προχωρήσει ασχέτως το πως τα πάει η ομάδα. Αυτό για μένα είναι φάουλ. Θα έπρεπε σε κάποια κομβικά σημεία να υπάρχουν διακλαδώσεις, αλλιώς πιο το νόημα σε μια campaign? Το αποτέλεσμα είναι ότι ενώ όλοι αρχικά ήμασταν ενθουσιασμένοι με το παιχνίδι, μετά αρχίσαμε να ξενερώνουμε όταν βλέπαμε πως στην τελική το στόρυ πάει μόνο του αγνοώντας το τι κάνουν οι παίκτες. 

Παικτικά επαναλαμβάνω είναι πολύ ωραίες οι αποφάσεις για τα upgrades και το ποιους χαρακτήρες θα πάρουμε μαζί μας στη κάθε αποστολή. Βέβαια συνεχίζεις να παίζεις πανδημία οπότε αν την σιχαίνεστε τελείως δεν νομίζω να σας αλλάξει άποψη η legacy εκδοχή της. Από την άλλη οι φαν της πανδημίας θα ξετρελαθούν. Ο Legacy μηχανισμός έχει να δώσει πολλά. Περιμένω κάποιο άλλο παιχνίδι να τον εκμεταλλευτεί καλύτερα. ;)

Προφανώς είναι καλύτερο από την απλή πανδημία αλλά μην περιμένετε παπάδες. Θα μπορούσε να είναι πολύ καλύτερο αν είχαν εστιάσει περισσότερο στο story κομμάτι του παιχνιδιού. Ίσως φταίει πως είχα μεγάλες προσδοκίες λόγο του hype. Γενικά πάντως αξίζει να την δοκιμάσετε. Είναι μια ωραία εμπειρία.

Exactly like Pandemic, but in a "Tutorial-learn-as-you-play" way of getting you to play the last (and theoretically the most difficult) mission. I don't like pandemic "bad draws = easy lose" way of being, and Legacy is mostly the same in that matter.

And worse. If you play twice and decide you don't like the game, you can't even sell it. That sucks.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
"Legacy games shouldn't count in the rankings," they say. "A one-time 'experience' isn't a real 'game,'" they say. "What, do you just throw it away when you're done?" they say. Balderdash. Pandemic Legacy took a riveting and enjoyable cooperative game and turned it into a white-knuckle narrative bombshell. Every game felt like we were doing the best we could, but we had no clue what to expect from the Legacy Deck. Blah blah blah SPOILERS, it was riveting and unforgettable.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
Working together with my teammates knowing that everyone had, at one point, made at least one critical error in planning because of what we didn't know. Looking back on each choice and agonizing over our simultaneous best-choice-right-now agency and the very realistic dread that we-could-never-have-known drama awaited us at every turn. The permanence of our inability to play a perfect game, as represented in the scarring across the board, is very gripping.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Like normal Pandemic, some games are simply unwinnable given how the deck is randomized. When the second card is an Epidemic, and the next two Epidemic cards from their respective stacks are, in fact, directly on top of each other, cities are going to riot very quickly, and then you lose.

Here's to "Season 2"!

RATING: 10
Rating adjusted upwards after four plays - Absolutely fantastic!  Such an incredible mix of the original Pandemic mechanisms meshed into an ongoing campaign that really builds the tension and delivers an amazing narrative, filled with stress, tension and a roller-coaster of competing decisions.

Although I must say it is agonising tearing-up cards.  I can't wait to see what happens next - so exciting.

This one turned a game i liked into the game i'm itching to play whenever i see the box. The legacy element has been implemented beaufitully, often catching you off guard and forcing to adjust to new conditions. Carefully planned surprises (both pleasant and unpleasant) and dynamic difficulty make it hard to get bored.

RATING: 9
With almost 20 gaming sessions, Pandemic Legacy was money well spent. The game nicely implements new features just when you are getting bored to the old ones. The narrative works well with the game mechanics. The only downside was that some characters were obviously more beneficial than others. We sometimes played the less useful characters just to receive more funding ;)

Anna was ready to sacrifice herself. She was so surprised when Ernie did. Now she has to just deal with being alive.

In short, this is how you tell a story in a game - this is how you immerse people in a world - this is how you make characters seem real and breathing. Not just by blurring real world consequences (destroying or modifying objects) with game ones, either - I think a lot of what works best here need not be in strictly Legacy format.

Coming from someone who feels the original Pandemic is just a tiny bit overrated, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Probably my game of the year. Legacy games look like they're a very good idea.

So, it's Pandemic with expansions and permanence.  Just one problem: in order to enjoy the story, you have to play Pandemic.  And if you start a campaign, but don't finish it: guess what? You can't trade it.  Glad I got rid of mine before placing the first sticker.  Really dodged a bullet.

This one I'm really scoring following BGG scoring - so, I won't play it ever again. i don't think it's a bad game per se, but I found the story not only terribly cliché, but also much less involved and substantial than expected. In the end it was a succession of pandemic games with upgrades after every game and by the end of it I was SICK of being forced to play so many games for such a small story "reward" at the end of it. I would've enjoyed Risk Legacy more, probably.

I really enjoyed this game with the exception of one game session in which I got messed over by the game - intentionally - and for that I have dropped it one point. It was not fun when that event occurred - I could not have prevented it, and it was the one point in which I felt the game creator was stepping in and manipulating my game and specifically taking away my control - and I didn't like it. It felt artificial and frustrating. Barring that, I loved the campaign. It was fun having a running "story" and I will be in for season 2.

RATING: 7
A solid legacy game that admittely loses some appeal on subsequent play-throughs. A lot of the enjoyment and appeal comes from the surprises and strategies that develop as the game goes on. I played with two separate groups at the same time. I always dramatically enjoyed the sessions with whatever group was ahead. The other group wasn't as much fun because I knew what was coming, I knew what would or wouldn't work, and I felt like I had to be far less involved simply so I could avoid tainting the experience for the other players. If you play a second time, I'd recommend doing it with others who have played the game so you can share the same experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's at least a 9. I can't remember the last time I played a game 5 times in a row and still wanted to play another.

-Updated after final game:
I'm knocking the score down to an 8. It was a fun experience but the end was a little dissatisfying and we got into a cycle of losing that we could not seem to break. This was despite winning all but two of our games up through October. To be fair, I'm not sure how much of that is the game's fault vs. our own. All in all it was a good experience but I'm not convinced it was really any more fun than non-legacy Pandemic, so I'll rate them the same.

-Updated again.
This was a fun experience but I've decided I like plain old normal Pandemic better.

The suspense / story arc / role-playing aspects live up to the rave reviews. It's a very entertaining "experience." But as a "game" I give vanilla Pandemic a "6.4" (I'm not a big fan of co-ops), and at the end of the day this is just a more elaborate version of that.

Simple to play like the original Pandemic game. The game slowly introduces new things in an easy to digest manner. The legacy system in the game is extremely interesting and turns the game into a pretty fascinating story where every decision has consequences that can have a visible and permanent effect on the game. An incredibly intense experience that I really enjoyed. The end is a bit of a mess and the wording on some of the cards - particularly the legacy ones - could stand to be a little clearer, but it's one hell of an experience that I do not regret.

Matt Leacock's Pandemic combined with Rob Daviau's Legacy system? How could this not rocket it's way to #1 in record time? It takes one of the best coops on the market and gives it a cohesive and deep story. It deserves all the attention and accolades it has gotten.

Ok i LOVE pandemic a lot, so this should be a 10, it is not just because it ends. I want a new game that is called pandemic legacy the never ending story (probably a computer game) that just keeps going.. :-)

Actually the real reason behind the vote not being a 10 is that i played with a friend that was an alpha player (even if he was a pandemic noob), some of the games were just 3 of us arguing an hour against him.. Not cool. It's not directly connected on the game design, but it is a bit.

I've loved every play of this game and although the story elements are lighter than I initially expected the incremental changes are enough to keep the game new/fresh while not reinventing the wheel each round.

We've played with a static 4p group and therefore haven't moved through as fast as some groups; however, I feel keeping the group the same has increased my immersion and enjoyment.

Very enjoyable and much better than vanilla Pandemic (which I rated as a 5).  Through February at the moment, and this has the possibility of going up higher to a 9-10 depending on how the rest of the months go.

Update:  Played through April and upgrading to a 9.  Some interesting shenanigans going on so far!

Update: After September am upgrading it to a 10.  So many wonderful mechanics that expand the base game and provide a fun engaging storyline.

We were Pandemic fans before but were completely blown away by the narrative aspect of the game. When the campaign ended we felt like junkies in need of a fix (we binged on the campaign during about 2 weeks). However I regret that the campaign is not playable again (using the same box). I am pretty sure, I would enjoy it the second time as much as the first (since I have forgotten almost everything about the story nearly 2 years later).

The true Number 1 in the Bgg rank is Twilight Struggle and not this loathsome deception named Pandemic Legacy.

Everybody knows that Twilight Struggle is the best game in the last 10 years and it beats Pandemic Legacy in every aspect as well as Through the Ages, Caverna, Agrícola or Mage Knight do, but we live in strange times in which a game with only 20 plays and a worse concept by far can be brought to the top without merit.

In 5 years everybody will be complaining about the proliferation of different Legacies and perishable games and then this kind of games will not be cool and amazing anymore.

A remarkable and unique gameplay experience. My group and I started in November 2015 and finished in January 2016, and we constantly had the drive to play and advance the plot. The game mutates and plays with the core Pandemic systems seamlessly, and the pre- and post-game discussions about team composition and upgrade choices are just as fun as the play itself. My group and I can't wait for season 2. Highly recommended.

I am a huge fan of the original pandemic so as expected this game had a very high standard, but it's also not surprising that I love it. It's so fun to follow through the changing rules and stories. One game I actually feel disapointed when I loose. Would be a 10 but sometimes you play perfectly and luck just isn't on your side.

RATING: 6
I dislike the (1) lack of replay value, (2) the high variability in the potential number of game sessions, (3) the need for group continuity, and (4) cost. The combination of these four factors are significant enough that most of my (large) gaming group hold that it is best to distribute the cost of purchasing Pandemic Legacy over the select players who intend to play through the game. This game seems to work best when binged played over one or two sessions.

Such a fantastic game! Offers a very unique experience with lots of surprises. To those concerned about only playing through this game once for $60, remember that's a MINIMUM of 12 plays, and a maximum of 24. Ask yourself...how many games do you own that are medium weight games, take 1.5 hours each game to play through, have you ACTUALLY played more than a few times? Those of us with huge collections I'm sure can point to a game we love, but have only played a handful of times. This game is made all the more special because when you complete the game, you have so many fond memories of what happened over the course of the game to reflect on. Amazing game.

Dramatically improves upon base Pandemic in terms of using the game as a storytelling vehicle, with lots of surprises sprung upon the players. While I'm not the biggest fan of this sort of 'disposable' game product, that's really only a minor aesthetic complaint...you ARE getting a return on your investment as far as pure entertainment, and you'll likely play more sessions of this than most games in your collection that have sat there gathering dust after plopping down $50+ to have it there.

The gameplay itself? Golden.

It was a good match to combine Pandemic with the 'Legacy' system. Even though I did enjoy this much more than vanilla Pandemic I don't think it is THAT amazing as the hype suggests. Worth trying out, but I am not very eager to play it again (i.e. Season 2).

Only on month one, but I am hooked.

Terrified and hooked! The game has many twists and turns and the legacy function really works in pandemic to make choices feel more important and have more debate around the table as any wrong move could be your last (literally!).

The changes really add to the stress and epic nature of pandemic, plus when all is said and done (provided you don't tear up any character cards) you have a base game of pandemic to play normally.

Eagerly awaiting February and dreading what could be behind some of those doors!

just about 1/3 of the way through the campaign so far.  I do really like the legacy elements of this game - the evolving mechanics and unfolding story-line.

Still a great implementation of a tried and true system.

Pandemic is one of my favorite co-ops. After playing Legacy, I've dropped the vanilla original to a 9 and Legacy is now the 10. It's a brilliant story-driven reimplementation and a natural fit for the Legacy system. I'd be sorely tempted to play multiple campaigns of the same season, and definitely looking forward to the next season.

RATING: 10
Rég voltam ennyire kíváncsi játékra, és ma végre megadatott a próbajáték 2 db kétfős parti formájában, ami remélem csak egy hosszabb játékfolyam kezdete volt, mert ezt bizony több okból is muszáj lesz folytatni (okokat lásd később)!

Több, mint 850 játékot pontoztam eddig, és bár korábban több 10-est is adtam, a folyamatos átpontozások után egy ideje már csak a Caylus állt nálam 10-esen. Egészen mostanáig. A Pandemic Legacy ugyanis ezennel ünepélyesen megkapja a 10-est. Kivárhatnék még néhány partit ezzel a magas ponttal, hiszen még csak töredékét ismerhettem meg a játéknak, de már így is annyira átütő, hogy simán megérdemli. Így a kőkemény eurogém Caylus mellett egy könnyedebb coop játék is felkerült a képzeletbeli legfelső polcomra. 

Mi indokolja a 10-est:

Először is: a sima Pandemicet egy jó családi coopnak tartom (7-est adtam rá), de nem a legjobb coopnak (BSG, vagy Robinson sokkal jobb). A Lab kieggel már egy nagyon jó játék (8 pont), ha nem is kedvenc, de bármikor kategória. A Legacy viszont olyan magasan veri az alap változatot, hogy a 9-es már csak ezért is kevés lenne rá. Több, mint 2 pont a különbség.

Másodszor: A Legacy mechanizmust a Risk-nél nem próbáltam, így nekem totál új volt. Nos, szerintem lehengerlő, igaz még csak 2 hónapon vagyunk túl, de tisztára olyan, mintha minden egyes pályához egy külön kis kieg járna, ráadásul itt nem az van mint egy "normál kiegnél", hogy felkészülök a szabályából és hozzáadom az alaphoz. Itt menet közben tudok meg mindent. Én egy mezei promo lapnak is örülni tudok, ennek itt sokszorosát kapom negyed óránként. Már a legelső hónap is több egy kicsit, mint az alap Pandemic, de a 2. pályán már új (eddigi kiadásokban sosem látott) kellék jelenik meg, és nem kell nagy fantázia hozzá, hogy a többi doboz is rengeteg meglepit rejt. Szóval nálam/nálunk telitalálat a mechanizmus.

Harmadik: Ha a játékot nem érezném ennyire forradalminak, akkor is lenne egy dolog, ami miatt elgondolkodnék a 10-esen: a sok tulok miatt, aki kipróbálás nélkül csak azért 1-est ad, mert nem akarják, hogy a kedvencét beelőzze egy ilyen fura agyonhype-olt újítás. Nos én személy szerint pl. a Terra vagy a TTA elsőségének nagyon tudnék örülni (az új TTA elsőségét nem is tartom kizártnak valamikor pár év múlva), és a TS elsőségét is korrektnek tartom (sokakkal ellentétben nem zavar, hogy 2 személyes játék vezet), de egyáltalán nem zavarna, ha a P.Legacy lenne a top1, szerintem annyira unikum a top100-ban ez a stílus, és ráadásul tök jól is működik, hogy miért ne? Persze ha most 3 éven belül minden klasszikust kiadnak ebben a stílusban, annak nem fogok örülni, de erről még szó sincs. Kiadtak egy Risk Legacyt, még az a faék egyszerűségű játék is top100-ba került Legacy köntösben, most egy nagyon népszerű és ismert játékot adtak el a Legacyval, törvényszerű a sikere. Én egyáltalán nem érzem irritálónak, és a büntető 1-eseket baromságnak tartom ez esetben. Ennyi erővel azért is osztogathatnák az egyest, hogy valami csak a Star Wars téma miatt van elől:) 

Konkrétan mi tetszik a játékban:
-Nyílt lapok a régiben ha jól emlékszem opcionális volt, de teljesen oké, hogy itt kötelező: gondolom részben a nyelvfüggőség miatt.
-A kiegyenlítő mechanizmus rohadt jó. Ha veszítünk, egyre jobban segít a játék, a következő partiban több akciókártyát ad, ami önmagában is jó, de ezáltal még növeli is a paklinkat. Ha zsinórban sokat veszítünk, még van valami extra dolog, de nem tudom mi az, mert még nem vesztettünk. Ha nyerünk, gyengül és csökken a paklink.
-A játék magját adó Legacy deck nagyon szájbarágós, ami pozitívum, de még így is sikerült egy lapról lemaradnunk, pedig gyengébbek kedvéért direkt van egy emlékeztető jelző:))
-Vicces, hogy pont Adventkor kezdtünk neki, mert a titkos mappák pont olyanok, mint az adventi csoki naptár:)) A dobozok is jópofák. A kaparós sorsjegyek meg csúcs:) (Update: 14 parti után, végigjátszva az egészet már nem tartom olyan jónak a kaparóst, tök idegesítő volt ezzel szarakodni az izgalmas játszmának esetleg a kellős közepén, bár biztos van aki ezt halál izgalmasnak éli meg. Összesen vagy 10 ilyen kapargatás van benne.)
-A meglepik közül eddig a kedvenceim a folyamatosan kiderülő szabályrészletek.
-Úgy általában szuper a játékvégi fejlesztések lehetősége. Bár győzni jó dolog alapvetően, de ha néha veszítünk, többször fejleszthetünk, cserébe viszont a győzelemért járó díjazásról maradunk le esetleg.
-A térképből és a szereplőkból is sokat kihoztak, zseniális pl. bizonyos szereplőknek egymáshoz való viszonya, a plusz képességek, stb.
-Nagyon durván eltérhet 2 társaság táblája és szereplői már a 2. évszak végén is, ha ebből indulunk ki, végtelen újrajátszhatóságot rejt a játék.
-Nagyon fantáziadús, jól leteszteltnek tűnik, és rendkívül dinamikus.
-Nagyon játszatja magát, kíváncsivá tesz, mondjuk ez lehet hogy csak az első játék alkalmával van főleg, amikor még a kellékek se ismertek! Mi lehet a többi dobozkában?
-Nagyon nagy jövő rejlik még nemcsak úgy általában a Legacyban, de konkrétan a P.Legacyban is, kismillió fajta épület, szerep és mechanizmus található ki hozzá, nagyon kíváncsi vagyok, mikor cseng le a dolog.

Ami nem tetszik:
-A játékmód bár zseniális, de lényegéből fakadóan károsítja a játékot:))) Ez az én kényszeres játékféltésemmel nehezen összeegyeztethető. Nagyon sokat gondolkodtunk, hogyan lehetne megkímélni a játékot úgy, hogy közben a szöszmötölés ne menjen a játékélmény rovására. Szerintem némi munkával ez elérhető, de nem egyszerű! Simán elfogadom, ha valaki 20 partinként beruház egy új játékra, simán megérheti még úgy is, hiszen ha 4 fővel tolják, leosztva játékalkalomra és létszámra nem is olyan drága.
-Spoiler: a meglepetés másodjára már nem üt majd akkorát?! Bár ez szerintem nem annyira nagy gond, annyi minden van benne, 2 parti alapján úgy látom, hogy simán végigjátszható lesz többször is. A többi 850 játékban, amit próbáltam, semmi meglepi nem volt, a szabályban elspoilereztek mindent, mégse volt ez gond egyiknél sem:)
-Aki a régi Pandemicet a családi jellege miatt szereti az lehet, hogy csalódni fog, ez szerintem jóval gémerebb lett így. Ráadásul a nyelvfüggőség több szinttel nagyobb, de elég ha egy ember tud angolul a csapatban!

Összességében mindenkinek ajánlom, aki kicsit is komolyabban társasozik, függetlenül attól, hogy ismeri/szereti-e az eredeti Pandemicet, vagy úgy általában a coop-okat. Szerintem egy ilyen különlegességet mindenképp ki kell próbálni.

Majd 10 év múlva térjünk vissza erre, de én most azt mondom, egy korszakos játékkal van dolgunk.
---

7 parti után néhány megjegyzés:
1. Először is ketten túl könnyűnek tűnik. Egyikünk mindig az orvos, másikunk pedig a küldetéshez épp legalkalmasabbnak tűnő karakter. Már júliusnál tartunk, és eddig még szoros is csak 1-2 alkalommal volt, igaz volt olyan hogy hibáztunk a saját javunkra, de szerintem nem ezen múlt. Egyszerűen az hogy csak 2 felé mennek a kártyák és így könnyebb kifejleszteni az ellenszert, nagyon sokat számít, ráadásul az erős karakterek sűrűbben jönnek. Akkor lennénk bajba, ha 3 karakterre lenne szükség, bár lehet 2 fővel is 3-4 karaktert vinni, majd lehet hogy kipróbáljuk.
2. Olyan mennyiségű apró szabály zúdult ránk a hétvégi 5 parti során, hogy mi már el sem tettük a játékot, szerintem addig elől lesz, amíg be nem fejezzük. Minden nap nyomunk legalább 1 hónapot:) Ha eltenném 3-4 hétre, szerintem legalább 30-40 perc lenne belerázódni, hogy akkor most hol is módosult a szabály, melyik karakter mit tud, stb.
3. Egy játék hosszának kb. felét az teszi ki, hogy bontogatunk és ismerkedünk az új dolgokkal:)
4. Feleségem találóan megjegyezte, hogy ez a játék kb. Robinson Crusoe kiegre emlékeztet, annyi különbséggel, hogy itt közben derülnek ki a szabályok. Tényleg jó a hasonlat, mert ott is egymásra épülnek némileg a pályák, de a Robinson nehezebb azért, több szabállyal, és ha elvonatkoztatunk a Legacy módtól és csak a lecsupaszított szabályokat nézzük (bár még csak 60%-át ismerem a Pandemicnek) akkor változatosabb és jobb is a Robinson. Nálam az egy nagyon erős 9-es volt, a Legacy szerintem ha ugyanúgy lenne tálalva, előre ismert szabálkönyvvel, gyengébb lenne a Robinsonnál, sima 9-es. Itt tehát a meglepik +1 pontot jelentenek, kifejezetten a Legacy mechanizmus miatt jobb a Pandemic. Ebből következik, hogy nálam a Robinson Legacy lenne talán a tökéletes játék:)))
5. Nagyon játszatja magát a játék. Függőséget okoz. Kérdés, hogy ez a 12. hónap után is megmarad-e. 7 parti után én azt érzem, hogy nagyon is van létjogosultsága az újrajátszhatóságnak, pont a fentiek miatt: ha végzünk, akkor sem lesz kijátszva, egész egyszerűen lesz egy már ismert szabályú, egymásra épülő pályák sorozatából álló jó kis coop-unk, ami így "lelepleződve" is nagyon csábító lesz szerintem. Pl. szívesen kipróbálnám más létszámmal, vagy más karakterleosztással, stb.
6. A játék megmentése az újrajátszáshoz szerintünk nem gond, júliusig legalábbis sikerrel vettük az akadályokat:)
7. Az elején még családi, de egyre nehezedik, egyre több apró szabályra kell figyelni.
8. Ha bárki elkezdi, legyen vele tisztában, hogy ezzel semmi értelme 1-2 partit játszani, mert az elején még szinte semmi sem derül ki a játékról. Még most a 7. hónap után is (ami 4 fővel simán 10+ partit jelentene, 2 fővel csak 7 parti volt) félve mondok véleményt, mert vannak kibontatlan dobozkák, nem ismerem még mindig a teljes szabályt, és az összes kelléket. Az alapelvek jól látszanak az elejétől, de az hogy mit hoznak ki a szerzők a játékból, csak fokozatosan derül ki. Eddig nagyon elégedett vagyok, szerintem jót hoztak ki belőle.
---
Némi spoiler: a városkártyák szerezhetnek bizonyos plusz képességet (pl. az egyik eldobáskor +2 akciót ad az aktív játékosnak), és a szereplők közt létrejöhetnek bizonyos kapcsolatok (pl. 2 szereplő egymás eldobott kártyáit veheti fel 2 lap eldobásáért cserébe), így  megfelelő kártya+kapcsolat esetén nagyon erős kombó jöhet létre szerintem, 2 főnél legalábbis mi nagyon kihasználtuk.
---
Végeztünk! 1 hétig elő volt a játék, szinte minden nap játszottuk. Nos a 2. hónap végén adott 10-est tartom! Van sztorija, csattanója is, egyszerűek, de praktikusak a kellékek. Az alapjáték 8 akciójához képest itt a végére közel 20 féle akciónk van, emiatt sokkal kevésbé családi játék. Újrajátszhatóság kapcsán elismerem, hogy a sztori ismeretében máshogy csinálnék dolgokat, de ha új társasággal játszom, ki fogom bírni, hogy csak a pillanatnyi célokra koncentrálok, nem a 3-4 hónappal későbbi dolgokra:) Ha azonos társasággal játsszuk, akkor meg a játékvégi pontszám javítása lehet cél. Szóval szerintem többször végigjátszós, és megoldható, hogy fizikailag egy játékkal többet játsszunk, igaz ehhez némi scannelés/nyomtatás szükséges, és egy nagy fólia, ami a táblát védi a matricáktól:) 

---
Na lehet, hogy szentségtörés, de végigjátszottam még egyszer. Tapasztalatok:
Igenis van létjogosultsága az újrajátszásnak, főleg mert teljesen más szereplők kerültek elő, más létszámnál más volt a nehézség, ketten sokkal könnyebb volt, de azt is el kell ismerni, hogy másodjára nem ütött azért akkorát. Mondjuk ha most pontoznám, 8-as 9-es közt lenne, hiányzik belőle a Legacy-s plusz. Ezt a részét mondták azok, akik az egyszeri játszhatóságra szavaztak. Én erre azt mondom, hogy ez se rossz pontszám, de mivel ez 15-20 partit jelent szükségszerűen, max azoknak jöhet szóba több menet, akik nagyon sokat játszanak, mert hát sok más elől elveszi az időt:) A játékélménybe (nem csak itt érvényes) súlyosan beleszámít a többiek hozzáállása. Elsőre olyannal játszottam, akinek szintén nagyon tetszett, nyilván ilyen közegben szabad teret kapott a lelkesedésem:) Másodjára egyik játékostársam azért elég sokszor szidta a játékot, meg mondogatta hogy nem érti miért top1, a végén már unta, nyilván ilyen közegben nehezebb lelkesedni. Bár az is tény, hogy másodjára a hangulatot én is megöltem kicsit azzal, hogy a bontogatás izgalmát kiiktattam, és házi elemekkel rásegítve 5 perc alatt prezentáltam egy-egy olyan újítást, amit hagyományosan kibontogatva, ragasztgatva, értelmezve a történetet kb. 30-40 perc lenne. Ez nyilván agyonvágta kicsit a hangulati részt.
Még egy dolog: ha valaki csak annyit megtesz, hogy fóliát tesz a táblára és arra ragasztgat, és amúgy mindent tépked és ragaszt ahogy kell, egyedül arra figyel, hogy a város paklit és az infection paklit ne károsítsa (néhány lapot nem tép el, amit különben el kéne), akkor egy teljes értékű alap Pandemic-je marad a játék után. Csak úgy mellékesen, és nagyobb táblával mint a sima. Ja a szereplők nem lesznek benne, de az tényleg házilag is legyártható. Szóval nem értem hogy lehet kevesebb pontot adni rá, mint a simára:)

Excellent merge of Pandemic with the Legacy element. Creates a fascinating and nerve-raking experience for the players that are waiting for the next twist. Unfortunately, the biggest nerve-raking goes to the buyer of the game, since the price for a one-runthrough-only game is a bit too steep, but given the hours that you will stay glued to the chair in order to finish this one, it is not too bad after all..

The modern classic coop receives the Legacy treatment.
Every game will permanently modify your copy, and after a few games, it will be unique.

For this game's comment, I need to quote user Hivegod, because he nailed it:
"This is an experiment in emergent narrative told through mechanical gameplay. The physical game is the engine that drives the story forward, but it's not the "thing". The thing is what goes on inside you, how it makes you feel, the stuff left over when all the bits go back in the box."

The stakes are so high, the experience so much involved... what a great, neat idea!

Pandemic itself is a great game. Legacy, however, is not perfect and I prefer Iberia (and vanilla Pandemic) to it overall. Despite its minor flaws, Legacy does offer a unique experience that is above and beyond worth the price tag. 

In Legacy, you play a different variant of Pandemic during each month. We found some months to be more fun than others. Additionally, we interpreted some of the objectives as pushing us towards building the board in a certain way to mitigate the disease spread, but the game commonly uncovered a new rule to penalize that mitigation in a future month. To us, that felt like the game used simple design tricks to up the difficulty as opposed to more interesting ways of increasing the difficulty. We also got very unlucky when a twist from one of the summer months was triggered during the opening game of that month. That is not particularly Legacy's fault, but it left a bad taste for the remaining portion of that game and the next two games of Legacy.

I'm not the biggest fan of Pandemic, but Pandemic Legacy is amazing.  The way the game changes in the middle of a play, and the way earlier plays affect later ones, is very cool.  It's got a limited lifespan in a sense, given that there's a story so it's a one-way trip, but on the other hand I'm tempted to just play with the board as-is after a single Legacy game.

Base [thing=30549]Pandemic[/thing] is a solid game in itself, but the Legacy element really adds a whole new layer to the game.
All of a sudden all your choices have so much more consequences. If you lose a game, you didn't just lost – most likely the board will have some bad changes that affect you for ALL your upcoming plays. That adds a level of tension to the play that really excites us.

In our very first game we had some really bad luck that (most likely) will haunt us for the rest of the campaign:
* We got our first city at panic level 2
* Half of the cities in Asia/Oceania are at panic level 1
* The medic has already 2 wounds and is in real danger to die

But none the less, our plays have been a GREAT time filled with joy, excitement, tension and despair.

Friend of mine brought this out a few weeks ago at a gaming get together and it felt like a lot of pressure. We were consuming this game and I wanted to eat it gracefully.

With 4, it sat on the shelf after we hit June/July. The newness of unlocking stuff wore off and the games were long and got boring. We then picked it back up with 2, and spent 8 hours playing the rest of it through. Ultimately, we really enjoyed the story and the surprises that were in store. Needed a bit more storytelling, a storybook or companion app could have made it a 10 for us.

No way a board game that destroys itself while playing can get any decent point rating from me.

Also very odd: when I visit my gaming club NO ONE plays it, no one is interested and you all get negative comments...

While other high rated games are treated and spoken by with respect, this Pandemic Legacy is laughed at.

Clearly some internet stooges for the industry hyped it but the game is not supported by the opinion leaders in the local hobby clubs.

A strange case of orchestred hype on BGG. They like to promote disposable board games, a kind of Magic but with the winner tearing up cards (like MTG was supposed to be played at launch)...!

The legacy aspect really spice up the game, you're more careful in every step that you take. I love all the post-game discussion, deciding on the game end upgrades. You really have no idea what curve ball is coming your way, there were so many WTF moments throughout. Game gets really tougher as it goes on, losing characters, gaining scars and getting more fallen cities. 

Finally completed the legacy experience on the 1st day of September. It had been an excellent journey with very good team mates. One of them appropriately described the game being light at start and gradually developed into a heavy game. There were so many things to consider at late game and so many information to digest. Our last ever game ended just one turn too early, luck of the draw affects the game but it's all part of the fun. I don't see myself ever replaying this as there's no thrill of discovery once you played through the whole game. Can't wait for Season 2.

Don't get me wrong: I like Pandemic. And I really can see the appeal here, BUT I CAN NOT support this lighthouse of ignorance when it comes to the finite resources of our fragile spaceship earth and the urgent & so very obvious need for sustainability in everything we do every single day and moment. And I know that I am screaming against the ignorant masses here, but here it goes again: Try to become aware of what really matters in an economy that is just mindlessly ravaging, depleting & destroying everything just for money or power... Check this online: By 2050 we will need 2-3 earths to sustain our resource needs... and these are very careful predictions. Thank you!

1st game - Was just basic Pandemic.  There was a twist, but came too late to affect the outcome of the game.
2nd game - Added twist was just OK, the perks from the first game that carried over made the game easier, still felt like Pandemic.
3rd game - Additional objectives made it theoretically more challenging, but one of the objectives was easily obtained with the modifications we've made.  Still felt like Pandemic, just less rushed.

Will continue to update as I play through the game months.

The first few games start off as base Pandemic, which is something that I can appreciate. However, the rules change ever so slightly every month, and with them come increases in missed rules, set up times, and time spent in the rule book. Opening boxes didn't turn out to be as exciting as cumbersome, and I was tired of fiddling with the game halfway through. The last month was really cool,  but it didn't make up for the slogs that comprised 2/3 of the game. Ultimately, the legacy concept broke what was most appealing about Pandemic: a shorter experience with concise and sensible rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Easily the most amazing game I've ever played. So immersive, it reveals itself like a great book or movie. Incredibly addictive. We played with three players and scored 753. We played the whole thing in two days, 9 games per day. 

Prior to playing, I thought I would have a difficult time destroying game components and making replay impossible. Once I got into it though, you quickly realize that replay is not the goal. The goal is to experience each twist of the story as you were really going through it. The play experience is increased by getting into the roles, naming the characters and the diseases. 

I can't wait for Season 2!

Just completed January with a victory; took 2 tries. Same enjoyment as the original, but the stress factor has increased exponentially. Because you're, in effect, destroying the game as you play there is added urgency to defeat each objective. Very enjoyable addition to the Pandemic world, and anxious to see what February brings to the table.

This for me was a revolutionary experience.  I was originally very opposed to the idea that you would buy a game that you can only play through one time.  However, the level of interest and excitement that Legacy adds to Pandemic, with a story and a sense that what we do matters for the future made the game super fun and am very glad I played it.  The rating might be high for what the game actually is, but in my mind it has earned it for being first of its kind and being so good at it.

Brian, Brett and I started our campaign during our Friday game night. We played 2 back to back games, winning 1 and losing 1. This is fun. It isn't #1 on BGG great, but I can see the attraction. The ability to personalize your characters is cool. Can't talk too much more without giving away spoilers. Basically, if you like Pandemic, you should play through this. EDIT; 4 games in. I enjoy this, but probably not as much as I would have hoped. The Legacy "thing" just doesn't seem to work out as well on a co-op game, at least to me. I do have high hopes for Seafall, however.

I'm on.. April? Playing with an college friend and his wife - Pandemic Legacy is enjoyable, but more of a puzzle than a game. However, it does well, considering it is a co-op (I don't usually like co-ops). Quarterbacking, as in all co-ops, is an issue, and it takes a concerted effort to allow individuals to make their own decisions. I usually find co-ops on the boring side, but this one does alright.

A thrilling game experience worth the price.

I don't know about best game of all time. In fact, I don't even think it's the best Legacy game (I had more fun with Risk). It's very good, though, and it turns vanilla Pandemic's already satisfying puzzle into an constantly mutating challenge with many levels of decisions to be made. The best thing about it is trying to balance the group's desire to win the current scenario against the need to think about what will happen to the game state in future scenarios.

April finished; we've had a lot of fun so far.

In the long run, I'm worried about the replayability and what to do with the game after the 12 months. I buy games for life and shun the disposability.

Before the first game, my intentions was to make a flow chart of the alterations in the game, but after the first game, it didn't seem like a good idea anymore. At this point, it feels like the game could have been designed to be replayable (of course, you'd know all the surprises) with flow charts, memo pads, and additional markers instead of stickers. On the other hand, I'm not sure if I even wanted to play this for another "year" (which would make me decrease the rating after the whole year). 

It doesn't really matter if you win or lose a game, since the alterations usually take place before or after a certain month, regardless of the outcome. I was expecting a tree-like structure; if you win a certain month, you'd get a unique permanent bonus, which you'd miss if you'd lose that month, and vice versa. In addition, I expected that all the roles would become useful in the game (like in Pandemic, the dispatcher is quite useless unless the medic is in the game) and I still hope they do. So far, we've played with the same (two) roles since the second game, and I don't expect this to change. 

So far, the spirit of this game could be mimicked with objective cards added to the regular Pandemic (which would be nice).

----------

August through now, my comments are still pretty much the same as four "months" earlier. Although, playing another "year" seems more probable now.

I don't think I can rate this game on the BGG rating scale. I like the game and have really taken to legacy mechanics. It makes for a great narrative and I think it excels in the cooperative form of Pandemic. However I simply won't always accept a game or always suggest it because of the multi session commitment and the fact that I know what is to come. 

It is very much a different way of consuming board games but that is okay. Really enjoy this one.

Looking forward to Season Two :)

It's an ok game, but I would personally say it is basically like playing Pandemic with a small twist, module each time and with a tiny bit of story in between and if you want more "story" you have to roleplay it more...
It's an ok to good game but definitely not an amazing one for me. There are plenty of games who offer more in all segments, from things happening, choices wise, mechanics wise.
I would just say Pandemic Legacy series is probably one of the best if not best legacy games out there but watch out in thinking that legacy element is true RPG. Not yet...

I didn't love this as much as some others did. Without spoiling anything, I found the new mechanics to be interesting, I found the plot to be mostly engaging and worth following, but at the end of the day it's still Pandemic. If you're lukewarm about regular Pandemic, this probably won't make you love it.

RATING: 4
Overall this is a campaign adaption of the already great Pandemic base mechanisms. Unfortunately the campaign mostly consists of adding minor additional rules to pandemic, which does only make the game more convoluted, while you still play 90 % base pandemic. 
On the one hand pandemic is a very well designed game and this game benefits from this. On the other hand the campaign adaption is pretty standard. Your characters gain special abilities, relationsships and permanent negative effects. Also you build stuff on the board and this and other stuff on the board can be destroyed. A negative aspect here is that the game is on purpose designed to be consumable, although this would not have been necessary. The special abilities, relationsships and scars could have been cards, which you add to the ziplock bag in which you store each character. The stuff you glue on the board, can be noted in a simple table. This lengthens set-up by about 1-2 minutes. Even the stickers you apply to the player cards, could be just put into the sleeve of the respective card.
Personally I also do not like, that this game is actually easier than base pandemic. It starts with only 5 epidemic cards and you mostly only need to cure three diseases, which makes the game maybe 60 % as difficult as base pandemic at the same epidemic card count. To counter this some mission like aspects get added to the game. These are sometimes fun, but overall not very imaginative and mostly it is only one kind of mission.
One other thing is the pretty boring story (Zombies and a conspiracy to gain world dominance). 
So overall: Base pandemic is better, this has the usual problems of campaign games, which get amplified by the game being consumable and it is mostly just Pandemic plus minor rules additions.
Would this be a normal replayable game, then it would be a 6/10, since you technically need to rebuy it, to play the campaign again I would be reluctant to play it again -> 4/10.

Just beginning the legacy piece of the game but the 3 plays of regular Pandemic have been underwhelming.  Getting boned by an unfortunate distribution of epidemic cards and clumped outbreak cards will never be fun for me.

However, will rate again after legacy experience.

UPDATE 1: Increased rating to 8.  The Legacy aspect really does improve the game.  Currently, we're through April and things have definitely gotten crazy.  The relative persistence, shifting objectives, and additions really help maintain a sense of excitement.

UPDATE 2: Finished the game.  Great plot twists and turns.  Some cards could have been phrased more clearly but nothing that spoiled the game.  I think an 8 is appropriate as it is a one-and-done experience (I have no desire to still play the final board state).

However, I will be interested in a Season 2.

I never had this much fun playing a game. We're completely immersed in it, the story draws us in deep, and every time we end a game, I immediately want to play again.  So yeah this deserves a 10.

Having completed the campaign, this is the best board game I have ever played.  
(my friends have been meeting up weekly for 4+ years and collectively own 150+ games)
The difficulty is just right (we came close to opening box 8), the story is excellent, there are many twists that evoked gasps and groans (usually from opening boxes), and each win brought a rush of relief, where each loss resulted in dark looks exchanged among the group.
I highly recommend this game, the experience is well worth it.

This is WAY more interesting than Risk: Legacy, and I think the only thing that keeps this from being a perfect game is the limited replayability (However, I do think just playing through, you do get your money's worth, so I am not one of those people who is complaining).  I think a co-op legacy game was a fantastic idea, and I hope they keep finding new ways to pump out new seasons for this game.

We played 9 sessions of this game, making it to August.  Two of us actively did not want to play this game after that with the other two not interested in suggesting it--the mounting "complexity" (more like, complicated-ness) made this game a pain to set up, a pain to wrap up after every session and a pain to try to remember all the added rules.  The threadbare "story" did nothing to support the major increase of administrative work required of the players after each session and the whole thing just collapsed.

The sad thing is I wasted 9 sessions of time with gamers who like interactive economic games.  The great thing is we still get together.

I like regular pandemic, but not enough to ever ask someone to play it with me. I can admire it from a distance, but I don't have as much fun playing it because it feels repetitive to me.

The tearing up and burning of cards made all my decisions feel so heavy and permanent. The legacy aspect really raises the stakes.

Its not "use once and throw away". Its "play 20 times to create your own unique game board which you can then play on forever". Due to having to play the game between 12 and 24 times, this is one of the most replayable games in the world. Many people play their other games a handful of times. They will play Pandemic Legacy over a dozen. The story in this game is fantastic. What an experience.

I'm not as blown away by this game as others seem to be. I don't find the overall story arch as interesting as others. What I do like is how your strategy needs to adjust month to month (and occasionally within a month) as the threats and challenges change and new resource becomes available. It's a nice change from regular Pandemic, but I don't know if it really is that much better than regular Pandemic with an expansion to add a little variety.

I never played Pandemic before and the first few games were really fun due to the legacy aspect. Unfortunately, by half-time all those added mechanics (searches) felt pretty dull and we just wanted to finally finish it. It was a relieve to destroy it in the end. I really don't get all the hype and praise, especially for vanilla Pandemic - this game is won or lost directly during setup if you don't play like a fool or get terribly unlucky.

This game was absolutely amazing. It take Pandemic which was already a great game and adds so much to it. It adds an interesting story, it adds new features to the game as the story unravels, and you always have to think about how your actions will impact the rest of the campaign. Each time you get to open a box or you get a new card it feels like you are opening a present. Overall just a great experience. I played with 4 players and we played 17 games, with 11 wins.

I will admit that I played the game in a non-destructive manner. There were 3 different groups of people I wanted to play this with and I was not going to buy 3 copies. I used a lot of post-it notes and card sleeves to keep everything intact. I don't feel like I missed anything and it was actually fun that it was all our own handwriting. At the end we took pictures of everything if we ever wanted to look back at our board. I have just finished resetting everything to start playing with my second group. I am going to play passively and let them make all the decisions. I am really looking forward to playing this great game again.

Rating based on playing half the campaign (so far). Love the campaign idea, not sold on the "legacy" destructive aspects. The gradual reveal rules are OK but they leave some gaps where they don't quite hang together (nothing unplayable). Basically over times the rules become a bit scrappy. Great fun though.

I loved this game. (note the past tense) I would recommend this to anyone that wants to play through a fantastic story arc. I will not rate this game. I rate based on the recommend system which is based on how much / often you would want to play. and this game is over and I wont play it again. the story is done. so a 10 while I was playing it and a N/A now.

Beat December.  We won 12 and lost 5 I think.  Not too bad - none of us had more than two or three games played before we began.

Through October.  Good game, worth playing if you've got a consistent group.

Won May, lost June hardcore. 5/4/17

Won February and March, playing April this weekend.  Expecting some nasty stuff - the last two have been too easy.  4/26/17

Only in January in our game, but this is going to fill the Time Stories void.  Hadn't played Pandemic in years, and then only a handful of times, but the game is more fun than I remember.  We lost a heartbreaker in our first January run, and looking forward to more! 4/2/17

Lucky enough to have won this as a random commenter on Joel Eddy's favourite game of 2015 on Drive Thru review. Looking forward to our first play.

31/12/16 Update
The strange prologue to our amazing journey with this game is my wife and I had both decided it was too much of a commitment, so we reasoned it out and decided on Time Stories instead since it is episodic.

Cue to us getting to the end of our first game in The Asylum, enjoying it very much, when due to me randomly opening my mouth in the Drive Thru Review comments I was awarded the princely prize of the world's hottest game. Still one of the best emails I've ever received.

Now later today we will play our last game of this remarkable experience that has turned Saturday nights into Pandemic Saturday nights. I usually have to slightly persuade my wife to play a boardgame but now I find myself nudged toward the table as the hour draws near. 

20/08/16 - Finally got around to playing this. Great game gets greater. Really enjoyed it.

03/09/16 - After second February play this is now a 10. What a great game.

15/10/16 - Just passed the second May game and still really enjoying ourselves.

31/12/16 - Early morning. Later today we will play the final game. The world has changed significantly and the stakes are high. Some of our friends and enemies lie dead back along our path but we are ready. It is today.

31/12/16 - Won it at the 11th hour. What an amazing experience!

RATING: 7.25
Pandemic Legacy is a mixed bag (naturally). What I specifically mean by that though, is that some of gameplay variations aren't particularly good and those which are, are only good for the time they are introduced and would never make an interesting game by themselves.
Some are well integrated and stay with you for longer, but others felt like tacked-on, rng-dependent, boring minigames.


All in all the puzzles are enjoyable, because of their novelty and variation. The good ones stay longer and fortunately the bad ones were cleared by our group quickly. For me it shows that legacy games are not the bright future of gaming. In a legacy game you need way more content, which will be - by the nature of legacy games - not long with the group. As such they will usually require the mechanics to small variations or minigames, that by themselves will not reach the quality of the core game. At least that seems very unlikely, since designing a working core is hard enough.

The story is not very interesting; I enjoyed the overall plot, but I found the card text somewhat uninspired.

Character building is PL strongest asset. You become related to the characters and they become real characters with their own story. Mechanically their usefulness seemed very unbalanced, but this wasn't a big deal for me, since it's a coop.

Pandemic Legacy was fun overall. It is one the better coops in existence, because it offers a slightly different challenge every time, which forced us to think a little more than usual Pandemic. On the other hand PL turned out to be a too simple challenge, which a core group of ever-the-same, overpowered characters would rush through only hindered by extraordinary bad card draws and not by the in-game challenges.

First session 10/23/15

Wow.  

I enjoy Pandemic when playing with the family.  Really good game.  Haven't played with any expansions yet even though I own On The Brink.  Legacy takes it in a whole different direction from what I was used to without making it so convoluted that it would drive me away.  We are at April and I am always looking forward to the next play session.

This is a tough one to rate.  It is a really great experience and deserves a high rating but when you throw in the replay-ability factor it will ultimately have to take a hit because i don't see breaking this out year after year (actually instead of "breaking it out" you would have to purchase it and play a fresh copy)consistently because once you start a "game", you are committed to at least 18 sessions to play it through.  So, giving it a 10 seems wrong based on the accepted rating system.  Yes, it is a game I want to play at every chance, but only until it is completed.  Afterwards, I don't see having that same feeling about it. So it has to be rated lower.   

(update) Getting towards the end and the game experience is really starting to drag on.  The story is still engaging but playing virtually the same game 14 straight times is tiresome.  As well, there are a bunch of components (characters and items)  that got opened along the way that aren't getting utilized and probably won't before finishing.  The lack of replay-ability means that these components will never be used; there will never be an opportunity to see how playing those characters in different combinations would affect game play. 

Finished in 17 games. Finished with a win. 693 points.

I'm not a Pandemic fan but the Legacy version of the game is superb.  I was surprised at the quality of the narrative the campaign created and how the game changed as the plot was revealed.

The perfect marriage!
To add some clarity to my comment. I enjoy original Pandemic and will play it with virtually anyone at any time. The mechanic and theme are well matched. I enjoy co-ops when it actually feels like the players work together. Yes, a player can "take-over" but it is up to the other players to tell that person to back down, since they probably don't realize how much they are doing it. 
When I first experienced the Legacy mechanic added to Pandemic, I fell in love. The narrative that grows with the plays gives each play through it's own feel, as if you've added an expansion. I would actually love to spend a weekend with a group of friends and play through the whole thing in a few days. It would be money well spent, about the same cost as 4 people going see a single 3D movie at prime time (in Seattle).

Amazing game, very thematic with the changing state of the board and the different cards we can add or take out.  All the extra little bits and pieces that you can add each month to the game just makes it even better.  My only regret and the reason it is not a 10 is that it will be a one time play through and then that's it.  But even then it is still worth the price of admission.

We like Pandemic. Season 1 added some interesting  new tools and mechanics, and a bit of a plot to make the game more engaging. I would have liked if the new mechanics came in a bit more slowly and let you learn and enjoy them a bit before stacking the next thing. Pandemic can deliver some bad luck, which hurts a lot more in a Legacy game than in standard play. We mostly enjoyed this but there are some flaws and I wouldn't rate it better than regular Pandemic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
At the time of this comment, I am halfway through the game, having played 7 times with one loss.  I can confidently say that  Pandemic Legacy is very deserving of all the accolades it has received.  It is true that it is limited in how you can approach it - it begs to be played by a dedicated group of 4 people who enjoy co-op games.  If you don't have a group that wants to commit to playing the campaign together, or you simply don't like co-ops, this is probably not the game for you. 

For me, it has been perfect.  My wife and I get together once a month with another couple to play games for the day, and we have thoroughly enjoyed Pandemic Legacy.  Each "month" of the campaign brings a new wrinkle to the game that makes it a little more complicated, or changes how you play a little.  This makes each game feel new, but still familiar, injecting extra life into the game in the form of discussions of how you will need to handle the thing that is new this time.  These changes build on each other to result in a significantly deeper experience over time, which is also satisfying.  I have also enjoyed the way the game tells a story that is unique to my copy.  Those expecting the depth of story found in a book or movie will be disappointed, but I think it's just right - enough detail to help you be invested in the characters and outcome of the game without bogging down the actual playing of the game.  

I will say that I doubt I will buy a second copy or attempt to "reset" my copy and play through a second time.  Much of the fun is in not knowing what is coming up, and in guessing how to best use your end game upgrades to set yourself up for the next game.  Knowing how the campaign will play out would remove that, and I would have a hard time not using that knowledge.  I could see possibly re-running the campaign with the same group, but am hoping that Season 2 comes out before we need to do that.

Overall, this is one of the best games on my shelf, and I am very glad to own it.

WOW! Game of the year for sure. My wife and I have never had a gaming experience like this! It was edge-of-your-seat, cinematic, and full of surprises along the way. There were moments of triumph and defeat, frustration and excitement, and even times where it seemed like our fate would come down to simple luck.

We have played through the whole year. Went 11-4 playing 1 character each, and both of us absolutely loved it. 

My wife, who is not really into games, not only helped power through 15 games in around 2 and a half weeks, but often suggested playing. We also had really great conversations around what had just happened or what we thought was going to happen, which doesn't happen often with games that hit our table.

This deserves it's 10. Not because it's a fad, not because I'm cult-of-the-new, not because it's the new hotness, but because it's an excellent game that kept me coming back. I wish my season wasn't over but I'm definitely on board for season 2!

About halfway through a campaign now. So far, I'm really liking all the legacy twists. The new roles, the upgrades, the permanent changes to the map... all this stuff is a lot of fun.

The story is not very interesting (basically it's just "disease keeps getting worse"), but that's hardly a dealbreaker for me.

The problem is that, in the end, the gameplay for each mission still feels too much like vanilla Pandemic. The twists are all cool, but then we just end up drawing cards and hoping to find five of the right color. That's still what it comes down to, and I just don't find it that exciting or satisfying a mechanic.

Finished the game. I like the advent calendar aspect of the game and the new twists along the way mean you never quite know what to expect.  Even with the unexpected, I never felt too tense about the game since I trusted the designers to make sure it never got out of hand.  It never varies too far from Pandemic, so if you're not into Pandemic, this won't make you like it (okay, maybe you'll like it a bit, but somewhere in the middle of the game you'll start looking forward to playing something else).

I really like the new version of this. Updated rules and bits mean a better game overall. HOWEVER - still not sure about the legacy part - it may very well be that that part never gets played (although when/if I do, I will preserve as much as possible so we can still play the 'vanilla' version). SO that is why it ONLY gets 8/10. But great game otherwise!

I really liked this game through the first handful of playthroughs, but as we got closer to completing it, I just wanted it to be over.

Is it the hype?
Well, no.

Pandemic: Legacy brought the fun back to Pandemic.
It really pulls you into the game and you want to go on playing, you want to know what is happening next.
(Unfortunately the story twist in April, I believe, is a bit predictable.)

Unfortunately the game is much easier than what we played with Pandemic. You have only 5 Epidemic-cards and 3 additional Connections that change South-America and Africa from being a dead-end to being just a detour.

That's why we currently have a 6-0 streak, but we see the game becoming more difficult...so maybe we are facing our first loose in the next 2-3 games.

To be continued...

...and the day after christmas, the world was saved.
We got to 16 games (11-5) and eventually won.

Unfortunately there was a big mistake on one of the german cards that cost us a game. Without that printing error we would have needed one less game.
The game isn't the problem, I'm more dissappointed about the error. In a game where it is important when you open what there can't be such a mistake.
That really pissed me off...

The game really is an uncomparable experience (if it wasn't for that last minute turn-down).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's undeniable that the little boxes and evolving rules are very cool.   They add a sense of discovery and anticipation that most games can't touch.

To me, the greatest fault of this game is that it's still a co-op and at its core Pandemic (which I rate a 5).   Having to complete the same mandatory objective over and over again (at least through June so far) is somewhat tedious and still prone to the same problems that bad card draws can bring about in Pandemic.

So... I applaud the creative game design, but don't quite think any modifications to Pandemic could raise my rating.

EDIT:  July 2016:  we abandoned the game at July.   It was just becoming Pandemic with more pieces, which, to me, isn't a good thing.  Rating for pandemic = 4.  +2 for the cool idea of this game   = final rating of 6.

Opinión sin spoilers. Si te gusta Pandemic, esto es una versión mejorada y narrativa del mismo. Las mecánicas son una evolución de la versión básica con nuevos añadidos según avanza la historia que consiguen que las partidas no se vuelvan repetitivas.
Para darle algo más de dificultad al juego, jugamos dos jugadores manejando dos personajes cada uno (manejando uno cada uno disminuye mucho la dificultad).
El inicio es muy sorprendente aunque con el avance del juego esto decae un poco, pero aún así es una experiencia más que recomandable (siempre que te guste Pandemic). En definitiva, no me arrepiento de haberlo jugado.
¿Jugaré la temporada 2? Posiblemente si, si encuentro un grupo para ello.

I'm sorry to say. But why buy a game with a purpose of destroying it? It really doesn't make any sense to me :(
I haven't tried or bought it, but I can't see the idea of buying a game to destroy it.

RATING: 8.5
An amazing, intense, addictive gaming experience, one that I would gladly do again with a second copy (maybe in a couple of years). It greatly renewed my interest in my favorite game, demanding that each session be played differently from month to month. I loved everything about it... except for one: with two players, it was simply too easy.

We only lost two or three times total throughout the whole campaign, which is simply unacceptable for a coop game. I wish there had been a way to make it harder for two players. 

The best part about the In the Lab and On the Brink expansions is that they make the base game significantly more challenging and rich, with lots of more difficult and crucial choices to make. In Legacy, the principal difficulty was simply getting bad luck with the epidemic/infect cards. So in that way, it was really fun but ultimately less rewarding than the base game.

RATING: 10
I love Pandemic, but the legacy concept ups the ante and makes it a virtually perfect game.  It runs you through the emotional wringer every time you play and never lets up.  I was hesitant to spend money on a game that would be worthless once it's finished, but this experience is worth every penny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Lots and lots of Pandemic.  The legacy elements are fascinating and definitely make the game more interesting to play, but it is still 18 games (on average) of Pandemic.  If you love Pandemic, you will love this game.  If you don't like Pandemic, the legacy elements are probably not enough to change the game into something you will enjoy.

This isn't my favorite game of all time.  That said, there is no game that I would recommend to another person, gamer or nongamer, more than this one.  It has broad appeal.  It earned it's number one position and it is easy to tell why.

Update:  I wont go so far as to say the ending was bad but it wasn't amazing to me.  Because of that, my rating slides down a notch.

being a not huge fan of traditional pandemic, i was really happy with my purchase of legacy. i wont spoil anything here, but the fact that my choises have lasting consequences on the game and my characters give me a reason to act in a way that everyone in the group might not agree with, which completely solves my problem with the original game. I love this experience so much, the sort of stress i feel playing this game is like the exact feeling i want while playing a game. the only reason i wouldn't give this a 10 is because after my first play through i highly doubt ill go through it again. while i feel im getting my money's worth it make for less than a perfect experience., but only just barely.

Probably what I enjoyed most was that this made us think harder about how we should play than probably any other game, with the possible exception of Time Stories. The twists and turns as the game developed were mostly enjoyable and the game turned on the turn of a final card - we knew we would win next turn if the final Epidemic wasn't drawn... 5 card left, first one drawn ok - down to 4 cards... 75% chance of winning... boom! Epidemic it was!

:thumbsup: [b]POTENTIAL POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Pandemic is my best coop game, so a better version with a legacy story-driven campaign to it is an awesome gaming experience (this is how we must approach this game, as a gaming experience and not just a game, so the non-replayability after the campaign is more acceptable this way).
++ The legacy aspect to the base Pandemic game really increase the fun tension that was already present in the base game.
++ The evolving story of the legacy campaign, which leads to evolving game rules, increase the fun to solve the ever-evolving puzzle of this game (and really needs players to change strategy sometimes). 


:thumbsdown: [b]POTENTIAL NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- I hate buying a game that have a finite shelf life. You can play one full campaign of 12 to 24 games and then you're done with this game (you can no longer play it with the full Legacy experience). But, you can still play it as a kind of expansion of Pandemic afterward with your custom content though, which can be fun (I have still to play it that way though)
-- On the point above, I would have like that the designers would include a sealed envelope that would have official variants to play the game using your own unique board afterward (to mitigate the one time use aspect).
-- This is a lower value game (strictly speaking, because of the lack of replayability of the Legacy campaign), but still a great value gaming experience.
-- [i](Not a concern for me, but an important recommandation)[/i] This game should always be played with the same people and individual games should be played relatively close together (ideally at least a game every week, max every two weeks) to keep the additional rules fresh in your memory.

RATING: 8
Like Risk: Legacy, Pandemic Legacy gets a bit weighted down with a bunch of bloat by the end - tons of roles and event stickers you're just not going to use, but because of the in-game action for adding stickers to cards the game space gets unreasonably large. Then there are a ton of rules it's super-easy to misplay even if you're binging - scars are particularly problematic since the effects are often rare and easy to forget. It would have been better to retire certain game elements as the story goes through different phases, removing some complexity while adding some in other areas, instead of always just layering things on top of other things. The rules are a bit out of control by the end.

I really enjoyed about months 3-6, but like Risk: Legacy, it just felt slack and messy by the end and didn't use the storytelling potential of the Legacy format in all that interesting a way. I was also kind of surprised at how much re-use their was of stuff from previous Pandemic incarnations.

Anyway, that sounds a bit negative, and I guess it is because the endgame let me down a bit which is always a bummer. But there is still a lot to enjoy here, and I still rate it pretty highly. The Legacy style is inherently pretty fun. The bar to doing one of these things is still pretty high so we're not likely to see a ton of competition in the space for a while - we'll need another big printing cost reduction for Legacy games to be easy to do - but at some point they're going to need to get better.

---

Man, I hate to down-rate this after really enjoying the first 6 months or so, but wow, it's turning into a grind. After 10 games it's become super-complicated with scars, abilities, dual-use city cards, different travel rules for rioting, falling, etc. cities, plus all the special rules, it's super-hard to play error-free games. And the narrative energy has really stalled. I dunno. It's still fun but I really felt overwhelmed by dinky rules and restrictions. We needed more Matt Leacock, and a lot less Rob Davaiu I think.

---

(no spoilers in any of these comments)

---

I realize there is a certain futility to these running comments when the game changes a lot from month to month :)

So I'll refrain from further comment 'til we're done.

Well, except: we're really enjoying the heck out of it. And, pick your roles carefully, as I've mentioned. We've lost 3 of 9 games; one was due to bad luck, and two were almost certainly winnable with better role choices. While at some level the experience is what you're getting here, as with all cooperative games; but with the Legacy format losing too often will start to cause problems if the world gets out-of-control unstable.

---

6 games in. I think if you're hard-core Pandemic players and up for a series that will go 18 games, you probably want to play with 6 Epidemic cards. Of the 6 games we've played, I'd say two were easy enough to not be all that interesting, two were comfortable wins, and two were close losses. The group I'm playing this with is quite good, but not the best I play with.

Couple additional things on difficulty:

Sunsetting diseases is a big deal; the downstream effects of a couple early disease sunsets and easier cure abilities are potentially quite large (just look at those game-end stickers). If you're cruising through the early scenarios, sunsetting and kneecapping diseases, you might need to take it up a notch.

Role and relationship selection also has a huge impact on the difficulty of any given game. One of our two losses really was just down just to poor selection of roles at the outset. Ideal roles obviously change over time, but choose your roles for any given game carefully. Dispatcher and Medic are obviously indispensable until the rules change dramatically, one other role will probably be basically mandatory for the current objectives, then choose the last roster slot appropriately. Characters can die due to scarring; if you aren't careful and get a vital role killed: you were warned.

Relationships are also a fairly big deal, wise assignment of these can make a big difference. There are some obvious good combos (e.g., Scientist and Co-worker). Get them into play and don't assign them casually. There are some roles with similar functions (i.e., both the Researcher and Scientist make finding cures easier), so bear that in mind when choosing which roles to develop.

Pandemic: Legacy has been quite absorbing and we've really enjoyed it, it's gotten a classic game back onto the table. I can even see playing the campaign a second time sometime in the future, maybe with a higher difficulty level set from the beginning.

I suspect I'll have a few nits to pick once this is done, but I'll wait until then :)

---

Played 3 times. If you're a good Pandemic team, you probably want to consider snagging an extra Epidemic card from you base set and use 6 to increase the difficulty somewhat. We had a really bad Epidemic split the first month and lost in a close game, but the second two games were not that challenging. Depends on what you like I guess; I can see it being more enjoyable (especially early games) if you can cruise through the first few months, without having to worry about replaying, when not a huge amount is going on. I guess just keep that option in mind as you play.

As mentioned below, we play with cards held in hand, not open, which we prefer, but as always YMMV.

Anyway, we enjoyed this. We are hard-core Pandemic veterans - we've been playing since at least two years before the game was published - and have racked up 50+ plays or so on the base games and all the different expansions. At this point, the game was pretty played our for us and the most recent two expansions hadn't helped that much in terms of getting us energized to get it back on the table. But Legacy is great and we're psyched to play it some more.

Risk: Legacy was a great idea that largely failed to deliver on its promise and was ultimately pretty disappointing. At this point I have a lot more optimism that Pandemic Legacy is going to get the job done. 

---

A little surprised to see that the game nominally requires you to play with open hands. I haven't even started the season yet, but I would still suggest that you feel free to adjust to your group's preferences and dynamics. Playing with open hands does remove some interesting communication questions, and also can feed some tricky group dynamics. Anyway, you'll likely know what your group likes, so I'd recommend playing that way.

Finished it in 17 games. Definitely an experience that I would recommend to all. Neat story and it's definitely interesting to see the board evolve over the course of the campaign, but it's far from the best game ever. 

I thought it dragged a bit over the course of the summer and 17 games is a lot. I can think of many games I would rather play 17 times than Pandemic. I also don't see the appeal of going through the game more than once. Knowing what is coming and how to prepare for it defeats the purpose of the story in my opinion.

I'm glad I did it, but I don't see doing it again.

After losing both November games, the pressure was really on to win December - not only for the WIN but also to avoid opening the box of shame! The rules say to open box 8 if you lose 4 games in a row. Even though it felt nearly impossible, we did win December on our second attempt.

Overall, a very good game that elevated Pandemic for me. Some surprising plot twists but not as compelling a story line as T.I.M.E. Stories.

If you win, less people die. What a cruel and bizarre theme for a "game". That it is one of the most popular titles and available everywhere is a sad testimony to the state of modern society; how will people feel about owning this when the next massively fatal and contagious disease hits?

I have nothing against science or reality based games - for a title which is far less morbid there is Stop the Germs (PNP): https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142902/stop-germs and
Virus! https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/180020/virus

There is also Healing Blade:

https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/179322/healing-blade-defenders-soma

Pandemic is a perfect example of what unfettered capitalism and mob mentality inflicts on all of us - there are many ways to make a game about the same subject matter (I live not much more than walking distance from the CDC and count many epidemiologists there as close friends) morally and in a way that respects life - in the case of Pandemic, simply changing fatalities to number of infections would be a start. Infectious diseases do not exist outside the context of global politics and society and Pandemic's crass and banal approach to the inequalities of our world is simply repugnant. 

It's also a poor game as pointed out by many other reviewers. Barnes and Noble, how I loathe thee for popularizing such thoughtless "games".

To be noted: I have only played through the end of August so far. 

It's a good co-op. I would give the gameplay a 6 or 6.5. However, the nature of the game does not gel with my personality- being required to play several games of it in a short period of time makes me bored and frustrated at the same time. The problem is that the legacy features do not change the game substantially enough to feel like enough variety is happening. At the end of the day, you have to play the same game 12-24 times in a relatively short period of time. 

I find the legacy elements end up forcing the game to play you, to the extent where your choices don't have as much of an effect as it would have you believe. At the end of the day, you are on a linear path that follows the story of the legacy deck. It's like a co-op being run by a GM who takes into account our little decisions and shows us the little impacts that our choices make, but as a whole, is leading us down a story he/she has already created in it's entirety.

Disclaimer: I am a Pandemic nut. Pandemic is one of my all-time favorite games.  I think it's one got some of the cleverest design around, and I've played all of its expansions to death. Unquestionably Pandemic [i]as a system[/i] rates a perfect 10 for me.

Coming to Legacy, I was a bit worried that the surprises for veteran players would be minimal. That I'd enjoy the campaign play, find novelty in the Legacy aspect, but ultimately be employing the same strategies I had been for years now. 

Good god, how wrong I was. Without spoiling anything, I can confidently say that this game will make you think differently. You will push the basic rules you've come to know in very different directions for very different purposes. Some of this is due to new mechanics which require different lines of thinking, but I also underestimated just how much the campaign play would impact the basic experience. There's a whole new fascinating decision space to navigate, and even something as (previously) simple as selecting characters takes on a whole new cognitive twist. 

And what's more, the Legacy aspect only serves to make these dilemmas even more nail-biting. This game has real, true-blue dramatic and mechanical stakes.

I could gush about this game forever, but the point is whether you're a veteran or a newbie to the Pandemic franchise you owe it to yourself to play this game. Seriously, just get it.

Update: 01/10/16 - we won! Final score: 766. Thus ends the saga of Hank McChiselbeef Sr., AIDS McCancer, Dr. Doqtuer M.D., Col. Mustard, Lady Flibble, Whiskey Tango Foxtrot, and Jim "Needles" McGillicutty.  The fight against Avian Swine Flu, Sudden Poop Explosion Disease, Erectile Dysfunction, and Zambles is over.

LOVED this game. Loved saving the world.

Admittedly, I only ever okay-enjoyed the regular game of Pandemic. Legacy changes that- there's too many rules to keep track of, too many things to deal with, and it prevents the quarterbacking that the original game sort of led to. The changing board and story makes it really fun, and opening packages/dossiers is also just the highlight of every session. (We maybe cringed super hard on our first "destroy the card" bit though, because it felt so sacreligious to do so.) Highly recommend IFF you can find a group that can play it consistently and loves working together.

Upon finishing the campaign, after gaming for 7 hours in a single session when we had planned for 2, my friends and I sat around and talked about what had just happened until it was so late we all had to go to sleep.  This is, without a doubt, the most fun I have had with a boardgame.  This is the best boardgame.

RATING: 6.5
Much less fun than I expected, especially after the first few months, maybe because it has mostly been pretty easy for us. I find the regularity of opening the packages (mostly at the end of a month or before set-up) much less fun than when they are triggered by mid-game events, as in Risk Legacy, for example, and I don't really like the increasing military flavour either, though it makes thematic sense.

I cannot really understand players who say this is their favourite game.

Just wow. Not huge on pandemic, but love this story and the permanence of your losses. Only thing holding it from a 10 is the limited replayability.

1/3/18: i still liked the experience, but I would never actively seek out to replay season 1. That bumps it down from a 9 to a 7 for me.

We are in February right now and I can say that - for us - the legacy mechanism feels a little overrated and annoying. Why not have a campaign that should be played in order and "non terminal" options of alterating the board/material? 
Also, instead of thrill & excitement when reading a new card from the legacy deck, it feels a little like "meeh... so what rule changes do they have in mind now?" to us...

In all honesty, I think the Co-Op part of Pandemic is broken due to unrestricted quarterbacking, which is also why base Pandemic fell flat for us after some plays. This game is multiple spins on the base game, which we already did not enjoy.

NO SPOILERS:
My rating reflects my experience with the game. I played a full campaign with my wife over three days - not consecutive days, but in about two weeks. That is very fast for us and rare that we play the same game 15 times in a short period of time! 
The actual gameplay is of course interesting due to the legacy aspect, i.e. because the story is evolving, but I have to say that the challenge itself wasn't too hard and that was hugely disappointing. Tbh, the game is actually easier to win than regular Pandemic, at least that is our take as we won 12 of 15 games (and should have been 14).
Other than that, the gameplay was exciting and we had a good time, and that's what my rating reflects - but I'm not sure I would play it again (but when season 2 comes out, I'm going to be all over it!)

It has been an enjoyable ride, but I think my enthusiasm is also partly because I played it casually with my wife and we had a good time – so my rating reflects that. I think that if I were to play it again, my rating would be much lower as the surprise element would be gone… However, I’m not totally against trying it with a different group of players, perhaps as a 4p game with some of my friends. 

The story is not bad, but it also isn’t that great either – merely just “okay”. I did try to be enamored with the game, but couldn’t quite get to that point. I feel like something is missing, and the game could have been much more fun with more “wow” moments. If you look at Risk Legacy (no spoilers), I think much more happen in that game. More radical and interesting changes. The things that happen in PL don't change the gameplay as much as they do in RL. I think Pandemic Legacy could have explored that part even more, but I do look forward to season 2 and see what that brings…

We borrowed Pandemic and realized we needed to play more... so for xmas 2016, a gift to myself and my partner ended up being Pandemic Legacy... we rarely played during the summer, but winter is back and we have a few more months still to play. Arguable that the cost is high for this game - but the replay value outweighs the initial cost. A very glad purchase for the entertainment and communication value add this game brought to us :)

I've played the game twice so far as vanilla Pandemic, just to refresh on the rules and flow of the game. Looking forward to actually going through the Legacy material once I figure out who I'm playing this sucker with during all the months.

Update: first generic play with coworkers. I've got two coworkers that are candidates for the full legacy game, and one initial play is all it took to get them excited.

Update: We've now played through May, and my two coworkers are hooked. We started gangbusters, cruising through wins and are now neck-deep in hardship and pain... but it's a good challenge.

Update: Finished December. Totally worth it. If I never play this game again, I will still consider it a 10 and entirely worth the acquisition. I was impressed that the story arc was sustained so successfully from start to finish. This is truly a unique game design that deserves all the accolades.

Pandemic Legacy was fun to play through, but the rule changes were just too fiddly and vague at times.  Now that we have finished the campaign, I am really excited to work on some variants with the components. If you are really into Pandemic then you will probably enjoy Legacy. There are plenty of ideas floating around for use after playing the campaign, so there is no need for people to be so nasty about the price point. It is meant to be entertainment, and it sufficed for us at roughly the cost of a movie date ( or less if you hit a sale).

[b]Thoughts? - [/b]The best board gaming experience I have ever had.  This is a Legacy game, meaning it has limited plays that change the board, rules etc as you play through the campaign.  Pandemic is already a solid base to work from, and the twists and turns of this game felt cinematic as we played it.

[b]Still Play Regularly? - [/b]Completed Legacy Game.  Cannot be played again.

Update after ~ 1 month : Already bought my third copy and will hold on to it until my kids are of age to play this.  It occupies at least half my conversations and 99% of the TXT messages I get on my phone are about it.  By FAR the best game ever printed.

Played through 1 non-legacy game to get a feel with the group.  There appear to be several more connections than in the regular (1st edition) board, so outbreaks are much more devastating.

I'm not finished with the full campaign yet, but so far it's so-so. I've played around ten games. I don't see why all the concern with spoilers yet. Maybe it's just having been more of a roleplayer, but there is barely a story. Granted it got my group to buy the game because we weren't able to watch a gameplay video since we were worried about "spoiling" it based on the reviews we'd seen saying it would be spoiled. Had we watched gameplay, we wouldn't have bought it based on the fact that it's pretty much the pandemic we already own. Another thing I don't understand is the need to make it disposable. I don't mind destroying components, this isn't about that. It's more that there have been campaign games since forever, and they all offer more change and story throughout play. This game offers basically the same thing from game to game, almost no story, but is a one-off play. Seems incredibly wasteful. I suppose I can recycle it when we're done:)

UPDATE: We continue to trudge on, Our group is getting pretty tired of pandemic at this point even though we've been really spacing out the games since hitting the mid-way point. We're determined to complete it, but I think you need to love regular Pandemic or opening boxes to enjoy Pandemic Legacy. If you enjoy opening packs of cards for CCGs, this will probably scratch that same itch.

2ND UPDATE: Still not done. We're down to our last few games, but we keep playing something else because while Pandemic isn't bad, it also isn't good. It's very mediocre and there are so many other actually good games that it's difficult to justify playing beyond for the sake of completion. I really don't get the worry about spoilers, there is practically no story in this. It's 12 sentences of story spread over 12+ games. I think I felt mislead into thinking it would be more than regular pandemic, but it's really not. It's the same pandemic experience with a couple modifiers that don't even do as much as some of the previous expansion material already released. Anyways, I'm dropping my rating from a 6.9 to a 5. I think my initial rating was built on hope of more interesting things coming out of the boxes but all I got was a variation on one of the most over-used tropes in all of board gaming.

3RD UPDATE: We've finally finished this terrible game. I never want to play Pandemic again, dropping my rating to a 4.

*SPOILER FREE*

Innovative in its execution, superb in its narrative, and solid in its core, like Pandemic is. It all started interesting and engaging, and I loved the way things kept on unfolding. Around October game time however, I got really bored with the whole layered complexity, and missed the elegance that Pandemic stands for. I admire the design with its complications, and I am glad I had the experience, but I do not wish to ever play anything similar. Too much underlying repetitiveness for too little marginal enjoyment... 

For sure this is not the best boardgame ever, far from it.

One of the best games out there becomes even better with the introduction of persistent elements that alter the game as you go. In our game, for instance, one of the disease strains became incurable within the first month. Yikes! Luckily, our crack team also grew in power, gaining new skills that carried over to future play sessions.

I've noticed that, while I enjoy the game plenty, it seems to fatigue my gaming partners, enough so that they're not necessarily eager to play again soon. There's undeniably a great deal of stress throughout the game, since outbreaks are always right around the corner. If you prefer your gaming time to be relatively stress-free, "Pandemic" games of any kind are probably not for you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a weird 8, as I doubt I will ever play this again, but take the 8 as my "how much I recommend this to you based on my own virgin experience" benchmark in this case. It's worth noting that replaying this, even if you didn't destroy it, really wouldn't work well as knowledge of what is going to happen will almost necessarily lead you to want to make some decisions differently in terms of upgrades, character use, board alterations, and the like. For me, this one time, disposable nature is not desirable as such, but the value of the experience that you get in trade makes it worth it. YMMV.

Finished the game with a score of 764 with my gf, though IMO playing this for score is kind of missing the point; this is more of a hybrid between a traditional game and a narrative experience and I think it is best enjoyed by embracing that narrative and doing your best to advance that over worrying about winning per se or rushing the game for the sake of your final score.

Very much Pandemic, but I love how much the long term ramifications of your decisions can affect the game. Without spoiling, having to make decisions about what areas of the board absolutely must remain accessible, and how to upgrade your characters and starting configuration are very interesting.

This is a significant other game for me, and it's fantastic in that regard as my gf loved it and we got a lot of enjoyment out of it. I don't think it is anywhere near the best game ever, but it is certainly my favourite co-op by a significant amount, and I think the price for the unique experience here is well-worth paying.

My only real niggle with the game is that though the objectives make the game a good deal more interesting, they also seem to make it much easier in practice. We invested heavily in infrastructure to make the base objective easier to meet (by repeatedly eradicating and making the diseases easier to deal with) and as a result we have had the game become progressively easier as it has gone despite the increasing complexity and all of that. We did hit a bit of a wall midway through the game, but we were able to turn the corner quickly, again by investing in infrastructure / permanent bonuses, and then finished the game strong.

Overall I thought this was very fun and I loved the changing nature of the game. Though it maintained a Pandemic feel, the game managed to throw enough curveballs along the way to keep the flow going and to maintain my interest. I definitely plan to buy the Season 2 release.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Addictive like the best TV series. It is GoT of the boardgames: you start with suspicions, you finish the first game (season, if talking about GoT) with a  "meh...nice, after all" and by the end of game 2 you are struggling to play just an episode at the time. Our group is now half way trough the  first season, we decided we were just playing one episode per month and this is making us crazy, we avoid spoilers from the web and talk about strategies when we meet. Just like a good TV series.

...and we know when this season will be over we will be waiting for the next one, even if we say "we had enough" (I don't see this as a probable event!) we will be playing the next one. 

Maybe not my n°1 game by itself, I have more fun playing other kind of games, but the overall experience provided by this game is mindblowing, close to worshipping. Boardgamers have to try this, this is a milestone in game history

Like Risk Legacy, Pandemic Legacy appealed me more than original - because of campaign feel and surprises. If the game would been made replayable like Voyage of the Beagle for Robinson Crusoe, I'd give it a point or two higer rating. But because of disposable design I simply can't - the game has absolutely no value after you finish it.

However, I disagree with the point that the game is completely rubbish because you can play it only once. That is simply not true because you will play it with good company at least 12 to 24 times and spend your time well. So the price per play is not too high.

Excellent gaming experience that pushes the boundaries of what board games can be. Yes it's worthy of the hype. However, be warned this is still ultimately Pandemic. If the cold puzzle/efficiency challenge that is the original game is not to your liking then this won't be either. My group gave up only four games into the Legacy experience with no interest in facing another 8-10 games.

RATING: 10
Finished the campaign in 17 games. Final score 815. I really enjoyed a unique story experience. There's no denying that Pandemic Legacy is a significant step forward in terms of incorporating embedded narrative in an analog game. The Legacy aspect of the game will of course be controversial, but I 'm okay with it for what it brings to the experience of the game. However, I'll be curious to see how others  try to take this forward and work around the permanancy aspect of the Legacy concept. As the game stands at the end it is unplayable after the campaign, and I don't see myself wanting to play through the same experience again. Probably my biggest gripe with the game would be the confusion and play errors which can come from a constantly evolving rules set. (My rating is based on how I'm felt while playing the campaign and my likelihood to continue playing this style of game -- i.e. Season 2.)

Sensational. We only just missed ou on top score but loved every minute of this game. It was great to get the same group together time after time and really get deep into a game - worth every penny and already I'm looking forward to season 2.

I love Pandemic anyway but this was just out of the park. So many extra, interesting elements and a trosy that, while not exactly original, was still gripping enough and with enough twists to keep us all wondering. Certainly a couple of things that niggled, but very minor and ultimately I'll miss our sessions now we've finished! Best game I've played in ages.

The legacy aspect manages to take a game that I don't particularly care for and turn it into something that is pretty good. Each box is exciting to open and making permanent marks is a new and fresh concept. Each new month changes the game up enough to keep it from getting stale, unlike it's basic edition. Can't wait for a game that uses the Legacy system while also having a base foundation that I enjoy more.

Early in the campaign, I would likely have rated this higher.  Obviously a well-thought-out design with interesting additions as we get further into the campaign.  We are now in June, and it just feels more fiddly the farther along we go.  Without mentioning spoilers, once you start losing, it can feel that you're so far behind the 8 ball that it's hard to come back - definitely not fun.  So for now, I'll give this a 7.5 - to recognize the great ideas in the game, but to also recognize that at this point it's feeling more like work than fun.

After 10 plays and our first attempt at June, this game just wasn't for us. Opened everything else in an hour, enjoyed reading the rest of the legacy bit, and repurposed the game bits. Not a good fit for us. Has made us EXTREMELY hesitant to try other legacy-style games.

Overall an excellent experience. Great design meant that just when we thought we were about to break the game it shifted on us. The final game came right down to the wire which was an amazing feeling after months of play. Best when played regularly as we had a couple of gaps between sessions which meant it was harder to keep on top of the changing rule set. It has been difficult to go back to regular Pandemic since - which we now just play with the kids or as a gateway.

It`s the best re-implementation possible for this game. The tension, a usual component of pandemic increases exponentially during the games becouse of the changing rules and conditions wich the players are exposed to. A must play game without any doubt.

RATING: 9
Very, very, very good version of Pandemic.

The main reason for this is the scripting of the game (one to two play per month during the course of one year).

The second reason is the legacy aspect: your plays will modify your game forever (adding more cards in play, putting stickers on the boards, etc).

You can feel the pressure during each play session, the Legacy part is well thought and the game is just amazing!

This game isn't for everyone.  It is a co-op.  With an alpha gamer, it could be quite un-fun.  It is a legacy game, so eventually it will be done.  And quite frankly Pandemic itself doesn't have a lot of interesting choices.  It isn't deeply strategic, and I don't see this really changing that all that much.

That being said, I really do love it.  It is an experience.  Will we look back at it as an all time great?  Maybe not.  But I hope that this will be another stepping stone in continuing great games.  It is a little like 24.  I loved the show.  It was fun and at just the right time.  Would I go back and watch it again and again like other shows I like?  No probably not, but that doesn't make it any less great.

I have always loved Pandemic, but we weren't playing it constantly anymore. Hearing that it had been adapted to the Legacy model was very intriguing and I had to buy it. We were not disappointed.

Pandemic Legacy ratchets up the tension as you know every bad move can have an impact on future games. [NOT REALLY A SPOILER:]  Just knowing that a city having outbreaks can gradually become harder to deal with instills a real sense of panic which meshes well with the theme.

At this point we're just one game in, but I'm positive this is an adventure that we will be pushing to complete within the year. Like a good novel, there's a driving narrative that makes you want to find out what happens next. Exciting!

A game that completely needlessly requires players to destroy it while playing? Let alone one this expensive? Horrible - no, thank you! It should not have been a problem to design/produce it in a way that the changes can be undone after the campaign and the game can be played anew. I consider the fact that it wasn't produced this way as impertinent. The fact that this throw-away game is the number 1 on BGG leaves me speechless. The requirement to literally break the game while playing could actually be considered as one of the definitions of a "clearly broken" game, hence a rating with the abysmal 1 might be warranted. Because I see some positive aspects of the legacy elements as well, I rate it with a 2.

Notes:

We finally finished our last game of Pandemic Legacy, and I can honestly say that I am glad it is over. With 8 victories and 9 defeats, we left the world in turmoil and it would take many, many years to recover from our teams failure. What started out as a fun experience soon became repetitive and tiresome. The experience was only uplifted by a victory or when the game changed direction. Will I be in line for Season 2? I am doubtful...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Two months in, two wins, and I'm not sure if I'll ever want to play regular Pandemic after that. Pure awesomeness :) 
EDIT:
Down to 8. After 11 plays, it's beginning to become repetitive, similarly to the original Pandemic. Still a great game, but not as good as I thought it's gonna be.
EDIT 2:
Done with the game now, unfortunately it did not live up to the expectations. By the end, I was hoping we'd win every game, just so it'd end faster, and we could move on to other, better games. I'm not sure what Season 2 is gonna introduce, but I doubt I'm going to play it, unless it'll be significantly better then the first.

RATING: 7
[Rating Legacy games is tricky. Over the campaign, my enthusiasm ranged between a rating of 9 and 7; I'm rating it at the low end of that spectrum both because that's where I ended the campaign at, and because the game has been slightly disruptive to the group dynamics of several gaming nights.]

Just like Risk Legacy was still Risk, this is still Pandemic - there's a constant amount of puzzle spread out over N players - but the campaign elements do help distract me from that. There are some cogent criticisms of the concept in [thread=1498463]this thread[/thread] that I don't entirely agree with, but which are perhaps worth reading.

One modest design irritation: If your Funding goes to 0, Event selection simply... drops from the game. We'd house-rule it to a minimum of 1, but the difficulty was spot-on for us (we ended up going 12-3, but with many *extremely* close games) and we don't want to make it needlessly easier.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.9
We love this game. I love Pandemic, but the extra stress and story added by the Legacy system just takes this game to a new level. So many "aha!" moments and plot twists kept us wanting to play more and more.

We played two separate games with different groups, and it was very interesting how each of the games took on a life of their own. Even though we got ahead with one game, we were able to keep the secrets from our other group. And it was definitely still fun for us.

Even though we lost both of our last games...BAH...they were both awesome experiences.

We CANNOT WAIT for Season 2!!!!

Playing with Kris, MJ and G. At the start of 1st May we'd played four, won four. Then on the 1st May we (appropriately) started playing our first game of May. A few hours later, we'd shifted to a played seven, won five record. The others refused a second attempt at June as being potentially "too depressing on a bank holiday weekend". Unfortunate when we got to November, a serious grammatical error on a card (that isn't in any errata) resulted in our playing three games and then having to revert back - a nightmare - which really irritated us. I can't give it a 10 when there's such a serious design error. A few months after finishing, reflections make me realise how little fun we actually had playing Pandemic Legacy. Although I’ve bought Season 2 (for someone else - NOT me) you’d struggle to get me to play it. Over time, my score for this went from 10 to 9 to 8 and finally to 6.

RATING: 1
A game that is suppose to be different every time you play, never the same as the last time. That sounds fun, right? That's what I thought, then I actually go the game and boy was I wrong!
The game tells you to glue additional rules in the rule book. Okay that is bad enough on its own but oh no there is more, it tells you to put STICKERS on the BOARD! What!?! And that is not even the worst part, it tells you that once a character dies in the game you then rip up its profile card, that right there just breaks my board game morals. 
I mean what if you want to take it to a party and the group there and you want to play from the beginning? Also once you have played it you can't sell or trade it because changes are permanent! I think that they either should've sold it for less or given you at least 2 of everything. This game defies board game morals and it is a game that at most will last for 1-2 years then you got no more stickers. So it's a lose on the money, it's a lose on the fun, it's a lose on the board game morals, it's a lose on quantity AND it is a lose on lasting for a long time! 
My advise, save your money and buy a different game, and if you have the game and it doesn't have permanent changes then trade it or sell it!

This game takes everything that you get from standard Pandemic and adds in an exciting, tense, and sometimes frustrating ongoing story. The ability to develop your own character over the course of the game and the timing of the changes to the story and diseases is well thought out and effective at engaging players. The knocks against this game would be mostly similar to those of normal Pandemic and are in my opinion offset in score by the engrossing campaign. What does hurt Pandemic Legacy, and only does so slightly, is that after the complete playthrough of the campaign, the excitement of some of the reveals is not as strong and some of the stress is diminished.

RATING: 7
Very nice experience. Pretty much playing regular Pandemic. Some of the months felt really slow and just delayed the fun of getting new pieces and information. When the story twists come they are very impactful. One very big twist really changes the feel of the game and finally brought tension and fun back into the game in the last couple of months. I would of liked to see less regular game of pandemic throughout the months as I felt it detracted from the main story line. 

Personally I think this game is a bit overhyped. Don't get me wrong the game is fun, and we had a good time, but only 2 months in this game really were a blast, the rest of the months were just a regular game of Pandemic with a small twist. I don't know if I would play another season of this. I might try Season 2 but if it is just more of what this game did, I will have to pass as this was just above average.

SPOILERS!! This game is a rip off. They have you destroy is contents and make resale/replay impossible. It has boxes that contain game pieces that you can't reseal. If you look at games like harry potter Hogwarts battle you can see there are other ways to package game box contents so that they are resealable. You can also direct people to put one time use contents back in the box after they are used instead of ripping them apart. The rules for later games are done on stickers that you stick in the instruction manual which in other games are done by a small sheet of paper and a slip pouch inside the manual. The game board also gets stickered up rendering it also useless for future games which every other game does by removable tokens. And when you actually do waste your money on this game you find out that, surprise it's just yet another zombie board game(when there are much better zombie games out there). This game is a cash grab and you are better off spending money on basically any other game.

My friend Brett and I just saved the world.  You're welcome.

This was not the narrative wonder I had expected, based on some very enthusiastic reviews.  The story is lightweight and not especially surprising if you're versed in genre conventions, and there's also no real branching; though the decisions you make during gameplay affect your future games, they don't change the overall arc.

For me, the compelling aspect was the way new rules were incrementally doled out in dossiers and boxes.  Opening each one was exciting, a little dip into the unknown, and making permanent changes to the board and decks was a lot of fun.  It was this, rather than the storyline, that kept me coming back with enthusiasm each time.  We played 14 games over five sessions in just under a month, and though I'm not the biggest fan of regular Pandemic, I enjoyed each one and looked forward to more.

The ending was a bit of a fizzer.  Due to good board management in prior games and a spot of luck, the finale was the easiest we played.

Overall, it's fun.  It's compelling.  I'm glad I experienced it.

It also leaves me really excited for what Legacy games might do next.

Played 1 full season.
Was fun at first but the game started dragging at around May-July. The last few months got tense again due to some plot twists and we barely finished off the season with a  decent score. I don't think I like Pandemic the game very much but I did like Pandemic Legacy. This is due to a number of reasons:

1) The game encourages group commitment. My game group wanted to come back week after week to see what happens next. If I just hosted a regular board game night, I don't think I would have gotten this level of commitment.

2) Slow ramp up of complexity. It's a natural tendency to want to see all that a game has to offer up front. Especially since the "starter" version of a game tends to be a boring tutorial that misses the meat of the game, what makes it really fun (looking at you Agricola!). However this can also be really exhausting, trying to look up and remember all of the rules. When the rules are introduced slowly, it's easier to remember them. We still made some rules goofs though, because it did get to a point where there was maybe too much stuff to remember. 

Towards the end of the year it was better because some rules basically fell out of the game, so it was easier to keep track of everything. 

Cons: Lots of unclear rules in the rulebook (and stickers) maybe due to limited space? It was tricky to look up answers without getting spoilers too. Very easy to play something wrong and it's kind of a damper on your campaign, because your group thinks "did we really deserve that win/loss?" But most of the time, these small rules issues aren't a big deal.

I loved Pandemic.  Past-tense.  It was just the same thing, over and over and over... and over.  After a while, it just was too samey.  But those first few experiences of figuring out the game, then trying to figure out how to attack it on the most difficult setting was a fantastic experience.  But it got stale.  

So take those first experiences, where there's a novel challenge that you have to figure out.  That is what this game is.  It evolves as you play, and your play has to adapt in order to keep up.  Brilliant.

I really enjoyed Risk Legacy (even though we never finished it).  But I don't like Risk--it was the Legacy aspect that intrigued me.  Now there is a Legacy game based on a game I adore: Pandemic.  The one thing I didn't like about Pandemic has been remedied.  Now I will argue that it is a perfect game--and I don't say that lightly.

I'm a big fan of Pandemic and was excited to get Pandemic Legacy having previously played Risk Legacy and found it infinitely better than regular Risk (disclaimer I dislike Risk immensely, it's far too random a game). I enjoyed Risk Legacy for the first few plays, then it started to feel too much like regular Risk. I've now played the first few months of Pandemic Legacy and love the way every game effects the next in a permanent way. I will definitely be picking up another copy or two to play with other groups and see how each group turns out. The no-going back nature of the game makes it feel like every decision matters, I'd highly recommend it.

Had very high expectations for this - can't honestly say that all of them were met. Still, this was a great experience and all around good time. I found the story trite and uninspired but the mechanics used to go along with the story were creative enough. We messed up one rule half way through that made the game much harder for us - we were able to overcome the difficulty after a few losses. Not sold on the disposable model of this game although, I can appreciate the concept. Certainly feel like we got our monies worth out of the game - just sad it will now sit on the shelf unused.

Being at the November game atm, I'll write a few words about the game but won't give it a rating until I've fully played it.

So far:
Pretty good game, but (for me at least) it isn't the holy grail it seems to be praised as ever so often. It's still Pandemic, albeit significantly updated (and thus more fun). To be honest, I can't really fault Pandemic Legacy for being what it is; because it is a very good version of a game I sadly find to be rather stale - and that's also kind of the problem I have with it. That and obviously the price tag and no replayability. You might say it's good value-for-money to play at least 12 games of it, and while I agree and even like the idea of legacy games, I hate thinking about how I'll finish it and then it's...done. No finding the game at the bottom of your collection after years and getting excited about it again, no gifting or selling it when it's done; it just sounds wrong.

Would rate it 8/10 as of now, most of it because of the fun we had being stupid and immature while naming things.

Update: after winning the October game, more than a year passed without playing Pandemic Legacy getting any play. Not because there was no opportunity to play it but because nobody was really interested in continuing it.

This is by far one of the best games that I've played. It's a role-playing game in a box that doesn't feel like a fantasy role playing game. The mechanics feel balanced enough for the casual gamer but has enough surprises for the experienced player as well. The only problem, and reason it's not a 10, is that the game eventually has to end. Once we make it through the months, the game will be stuck until we buy the next season. 

[28 Feb 2016]
Dropped the rating 1/2 point after getting into August. I question whether or not I'll pull out the legacy board after a full year and play Pandemic from that point or if I'll just gravitate back towards the original game. For this reason, I had to drop the rating.

[28 Mar 2016]
I think '8' is the final rating for this game. The story line made possible with the legacy elements is wonderful and keeps the game fresh; the big reveal in Sept was awesome. Why not a higher rating? To experience the legacy storyline you end up playing a game of Pandemic every time, win or lose. After three months of Pandemic, I'm a little burnt out on Pandemic. Combined with the lack of replayability, the game isn't perfect. It's not one to keep  long term but it sure was a hell of a good time in 2016.

The wonder of what's coming next? It's a total roller-coaster of thrills and extremely well made.

Just genius. Deserves the top spot on BGG simply for the incredible design.

To people moaning, are you telling me that five players getting what, 40 hours entertainment from one board game at $70 is bad value for money (for a game you're going to play once)? Because four of us could spend that in 90 mins at the cinema and not nearly have as much excitement and / or value for money.

To be honest, I think if five people got 2 hours' entertainment for $70, that would still be value for money, but here you're getting ten times that.

I went into this game skeptical. While I enjoy pandemic occasionally, and was intrigued by the legacy aspects, I wasn't really sure I could stomach the swingy nature of the games difficulty (I find some of the "you're just screwed" games to be quite frustrating). 

After playing 6 games, I've gotten so engrossed I don't even care. I had worries about a few bad games destroying our board to the point of being unwinnable, but it hasn't happened despite having some very tough games (only one loss thus far, though).

A lot of my preconceived ideas about the game (I did minimal research because surprises are fun) weren't quite right, but everything has surpassed expectations.

If you can get a dedicated group to sit and play through this game, it is well worth the effort. I'm hooked.

This game lives up to every ounce of hype it has received. I played through the entire game in a 24-hour charity marathon event (finished in 19.5 hours, actually), and even though we lost both games in December, we came REALLY close to winning, and that made the effort all the much more enjoyable. 

When you're instructed, in the middle of the FIRST GAME, to destroy a component, you realize that you're in this thing, there's no going back, and by God, you're going to see it through to the end. I would definitely pay full retail for this game again and play it through again . . . just not in a 24-hour period.

If you like Pandemic, you will love this game.

Probably most fun I've had playing a game. Tension is amazing when every decision you make will affect all following games. Each month is a slightly or more than slightly different game. Wife and kids and I have played lots of regular Pandemic and this takes it to a whole new level.

ONLY possible negative is that the rules change so fast that it takes a bit of concentration to remember exactly how a specific event is resolved in the current game. But that can also be part of the fun.

I'm going to need a Season 2 or SeaFall soon!

I hope there is a season 2, because it will be an insta-buy.

RATING: 7
Yep. It's all justified. (er... not so much... see edits below...)

In two sessions I went from "a legacy version of a game I'm not crazy about is still just a game I'm not crazy about," to all-in, all other games on hold. When the f is season 2?

Edit: And we never played it again after "May". Every gamer I know has started it, all have liked or loved it, none have finished it. Every once in a while we open the box, realize what it would take to get back into it, and close it again. If you don't have a dedicated game table where you can leave a game out for a month or two, I wouldn't recommend it.

Edit: Finally finished, solo. By the end it was a chore. Also, I guess I lost by forfeit. I got a new rule wrong on my last two plays and made the game way too easy on myself. Of course there's no way to backtrack or to correct my mistake. So, after all that effort, it's over, it wasn't particularly fun, and there is little to no sense of accomplishment. The only satisfaction is mostly just relief that it’s over.

I've heard friends say they have had the same problem. [i]It is very, very difficult to keep the rules straight in a familiar game when they are changing every time you play.[/i]

I still have to give it a solid 7, although the fact that I would NEVER play it again, even if the opportunity presented itself, suggests a lower score ld be appropriate. (Does that mean it wasThereare good movies you would never want to see again...) 

Bottom line for me, if you're new to gaming and don't have a lot of games you love to play, this may be a great experience. But if you have more great games you're dying to get to the table than you can actually play, like me, PL may prove a distraction, a nuisance and ultimately a letdown.

Even though the content is the same, a few things going in our direction in one game, and against us in the other, resulted in vastly different outcomes. For some people that might turn them off, as there was little that we could do to prevent the badness from happening, but for me I found that just makes it that much more exciting. I can't wait to see what the rest of the game has in store for us. A true evolution in board games.

Oh my god, so excited

Update:  currently in April and this has one of my most exciting gaming experiences all year.  I am just loving this!

Update 2: In July now,  my fervor is waning some due to a narrative direction I wish hadn't happened. Still one of the best social gaming experiences I've had in a long long time.

A really outstanding game. I got Pandemic: Legacy really early, at Essen 2015, and within a month I played through the whole campaign with my girlfriend. I fully understand all the hype. One of the best games ever! Cannot wait for Season 2.

This game takes pandemic in a whole new direction while still keeping true to the essence of pandemic.  Every month my group wants to know what comes next, what new mechanics/story developments will happen.  

The game is filled with self-balancing mechanics (funding/upgrades) to keep the game at just the right level of difficulty for each play group; although I would still recommend most of the players play normal pandemic.

I have to say, the first time I had to place a sticker, my heart wrenched.  And then the first time I read, "Destroy this card"...  I had to think long and hard.  Now we spend a great deal of time trying to think of clever new ways to destroy each card.  So far: tearing, burning, shredding, eating, and soaking.

Excellent game. I don't care much for Pandemic due to Forbidden Island replacing it for me in my collection, but the legacy elements took the parts of Pandemic I dislike (spiky loss conditions) and wove it into the structure of the campaign.

The legacy implementation fits this game very well. Permanent changes give the game a narrative quality, and add tension because players feel more invested in the extended experience. The game is self-handicapping, so a team that does poorly has a better chance to win next game, and vice versa.

While a copy of the game could be played with different team members, the experience is best if played all the way through with the same players. That does limit the audience a little bit. The game is very good, but it will be interesting to see long-term opinions after groups have completed the experience and moved on.

So, it's still pandemic.  I've had plenty of people, myself included, say that the base game was getting kind of stale, and that they weren't sure there was enough there to build a legacy game off of.  Others hate the 'alpha-player' syndrome where everyone else argues over the optimal move to take on your turn (something that's still very present).  That said, there's a lot of new stuff here, and they bolt these ideas onto the existing framework in a well-designed way.  

[Rather non-specific descriptions follow, but if you'd rather know nothing at all before playing, skip ahead.]
It starts out very simply, as a normal game of Pandemic.  But then, even without any rules additions, the game starts to change.  As events occur in your game, stickers are placed on cards, on sheets, and on the map.  Each month you play will see a furtherance of the story, usually introducing a new challenge &/or a new tool to combat it.  Your objectives (win conditions) change, new modules are added, and outdated cards are torn up.
The only complaint I had about this is that it can become a challenge to remember what to do as the new rules accumulate, or what options are available on your turn as new action choices become available.  
As you wind through the story, you'll open more boxes and panels, adding additional components to the game and more rules to the book.  However, the story itself is pretty bare-bones and could be summed up in a couple sentences.  If you're playing for the narrative, you'll likely be disappointed.  It's really up to the players to create their own narrative.  
I also feel like there is a certain amount of min-maxing that goes on, and must go on.  Some of the combinations of abilities that you can put together are very strong, while others seem pretty weak.  Characters can also suffer disabling conditions, so if you take too many risks, you could lose your most effective members.  If you make sub-optimal moves selecting these (permanent) upgrades, or play too sloppily, or just get unlucky in how the cards come out, you could find your game sliding towards disaster pretty quickly.  If the persistent conditions on the board degrade enough, it will get [i]very[/i] tough to win.  Now, the game does have a couple balancing mechanisms to make up for this.  You get extra 'funding' through beneficial events added to the deck, but only if you lose.  If you lose a lot, you'll get to open a special packet (presumably to try and salvage the game).  If you keep squeaking out wins even through the higher difficulty, the game won't help you out.  So, it doesn't track or differentiate between a well-organized/lucky game where you coast to victory and one where you win by the skin of your teeth.  Further, you get a bonus for the next month if you win, and nothing if you lose, making the up-/down-ward spiral more likely.
Lastly, if you liked On the Brink, In the Lab, or the latest one, you may be unhappy that barely anything from those modules made it into this version.  Legacy, though, adds enough new content to easily make up for that.

Anyway, to avoid spoilers, I've not asked for specifics from my friends who've finished yet.  (At time of writing, we were nearing the finale.)  So, I only have my own game to judge from.  I'm really curious, though, how others' experiences compare.  
At a minimum, the design's breathed new life into Pandemic and held our interest through the campaign.  And not everyone in our group even liked the base game that much, or co-ops in general.  From those measures, I'd call it a success.

Spoiler-free comments: Finished. The system is clever. It often generates surprise, tension, and excitement. The story felt too generic and capricious to get me caring much about the narrative.

Fun:
* Preparing for one thing, but getting an event in the middle of a session that changes the rules.
* Getting the feeling that we were experiencing episodes of a TV show.

Unfun:
* Large, ever-changing ruleset, setup time, and upgrade choices at the end all added a lot of bookkeeping time to each session.

Out of league.
This is not an ordinary board game experience.
The excitement and the suspance, the game changing as you play it.. if you never tried it before, this is the perfect door to the Legacy system.
Masterfully built, it shocked everybody in my gaming group.
Yes, it is a one shot adventure, and then is over. You can probably use it as a "standard" pandemic game after playing it, but once the campaign is done, you have spoiled yourself the plot, like in a tv serie, and furthermore you will have destroyed some pieces and altered the board permanently xD.
Nonetheless, if you are even a bit into the hobby, it's totally worth it.

I am flabbergasted by this whole Legacy concept. It's hitting most of the spots I love in (video) games where the game state changes from game to game, new abilities, levels, areas, items or objectives are being unlocked. And you never know what you will get, because it's sealed in envelopes or black boxes. Just this one gimmick is enough to turn average game into amazing one.

[b]Update:[/b] Downgrading from 9.5 to 8.3 after initial hype wore off and game started to be exhausting.

I would perhaps rate my first 3 games of this a 7. I do enjoy the unfolding story and the neat twists to the core game are generally good, however every time we lose It means we must play another game of pandemic. We are May at the moment, and meet once every two weeks for gaming. If we play one game each meeting that means my twice monthly game sessions will be this game each time until approximately June of this year (its Jan now). That's a lot of Pandemic... In general i think the legacy is well implimented, however i do wonder if the game snowballs against the players if bad decisions are made in the early games. There are counter balances but I am unconvinced by their long term impact. Also the story doesn't seem to fork much.

Great game, had a few very fun and thematic sessions (later months especially).  Loved the twists and turns they threw into the story line, it wasn't entirely original plot wise but within the scope of Legacy games, it was still very entertaining.  Not sure how I feel about Season 2 being completely stand-alone but I will definitely buy it and play it when it comes out.

Have absolutely loved it so far. I really enjoy Pandemic, but as many people do after playing a number of times you go on to other things. The legacy version of this game is just phenomenal and changes all of that. We have played 7 games and the anxiety level and intrigue is super high. Not only are are you anticipating how the current game might end but how the rest of the scenario will end? Love Love Love it!

It took four adults with jobs/families/work travel/etc. several months to get through our 18 games, but we were HOOKED. Each time we played we asked, when can we play again?

Loved the changes, the stickers, and  Legacy fun (ripping up cards made me flinch a little every time).

Yes, we lost both games in December (I really feel like they moved the goal-posts), but otherwise we did pretty well.

Will definitely pick up Season Two!

Looking back on Season 1, I really enjoyed the experience - it built on a solid game and made everything matter more. Legacy and co-op is a fantastic combination.

this 'full year' of game time is a fun co-operative that allows you to partake of a full campaign to stamp out diseases -- it is fine to play, and fun to see what objectives and penalties or helpers come out of the box depending on your months missions attained or not .. because the of the set-up and destruction of the board, the full game really can only be played once, a drawback, and how in heavens name this rates as number one on the strategy game ranking is a full mystery to me , the power of adverts, sooo exciting -- still it is an adventure of a mission, and a nice way to spend an evening curing the effects of two bowls full of maltezers ...

This is not a new game, it is a campaign scenario for pandemic. Do you enjoy pandemic, then the odds are you will enjoy this endeavor. Do you dislike pandemic, yup, it isn't likely that the chrome will make you want to play through this event.

As to the quality of the campaign... the ramp up of the game (the first 6-8 months) greatly exceeds the quality of the wrap up.... have considered dropping the rating after finishing the campaign.

The Legacy part is somewhat interesting, but does not change up the game all that much; you still have to play Pandemic 12-24 times with only minor variations. Pandemic is not a bad game, but it's just not a fun (unless you're new to board gaming).

Props to Rob Daviau and Matt Leacock though. The design [i]does[/i] work and I respect the crazy amount of playtesting that the game went through.

RATING: 5
After about three quarters of the game played I feel like this is the same old pandemic with a few interesting twists added. I feel like the permanency of many game elements can hinder risk taking that made the original so great. Really not feeling like this deserves the praise it receives, I bet most users rated this highly in the first few games and never readjust their rating. As our group entered the fall our interest declined immensely, mostly due to new mechanics introduced that just didn't feel fun.. There just isn't enough going on to make this worth playing over the original, we decided to read some spoilers and call it a day. No great loss, but please tell me this won't remain at #1, it just isn't deserving.

Going into PL I was not expecting much. I had previously gotten burned out on Pandemic as we played it a lot when we first got into board games. Our group also previously had trouble getting into Risk Legacy (we loved the concept of Legacy, but ultimately didn't like that it was still Risk). Once we played the first few months I was really hooked. I loved it a lot and it was all I wanted to play. Unfortunately our group has, once again, kind of gotten distracted and we are stuck in the middle of the campaign. Luckily, my wife Cheri also loved the game so we just went ahead and bought our own separate copy. We burned through the campaign in less than a week as we loved the game so much. In fact, PL made us realize that we actually like Pandemic and we went ahead and got a copy of vanilla Pandemic to scratch that itch until Season 2 comes out.

RATING: 7
I'll update this after each session, with final comments upon completion of the campaign.

Our second session was a rather difficult one... we lost 3 games in a row (both in May and first game of June) before finally winning one. 

Can't say too much without including spoilers but suffice it to say that this is definitely better than base Pandemic. The game and tension intensify as you progress throughout the year and the legacy mechanic continues to hold my interest (what is on those stickers? What is in those packets?). Designers have done a very good job coming up with variants that pose tough choices and keep you engaged.  I've now played 10 games of Pandemic Legacy in the last 2 weeks and I find it unlikely I would have played 10 games of base Pandemic in the next 5 years.

Some early critiques:

- I expected more narrative as everything is scripted from month to month, however, all we get is a sentence or two per legacy card. Certainly we have moments during the plays and a general escalation and progression is there, but I would prefer a little more explicit story as opposed to letting the players fill in the blanks. Perhaps my expectations were too high coming in as a result of all the hyped reviews stating this feels like you're in a movie... haven't felt that yet, but this certainly has more story than your average game.

- The mechanics evolve over the time but the actual game play still feels much like base Pandemic. Once you get over the excitement of reading the legacy cards and opening packets, it doesn't take very long before you get a samey feeling; most likely because the core actions (e.g. cure), infect step, epidemics, etc. remain in tact.. perhaps that will change before the end of the campaign.

- I haven't seen anything terribly innovative YET, but we still have 6 months to play. The Legacy system has been done before, some of the variants are in existing expansions and others are somewhat obvious. Still waiting for something that will fundamentally change the feel of the actual game play.

- The campaign is a bit long. I normally get 2 game nights a month, and if we continue at our current pace, this will take up to 2 months of my gaming in 2016. While I'm enjoying my experience, there are many other games I would like to play.

- This is a shared goal, open information, cooperative game, which is not my favorite type of game. I find these type of games to be OK, but not something I would typically rate higher than a 7 or so.

Pandemic Legacy is tough to rate as the BGG rating system wasn't designed for this type of game. After my first session, I rated this a 7.5 and this session hasn't done anything to improve upon that, in fact, I may move this down to a 7, which is the absolute floor as this is strictly better than base Pandemic which I rate a 6.5. I'm still having fun after 2 sessions but am ready to take a break and get back to playing other (non-cooperative) games in our group's collection, picking this back up in a month or so. I think this has the potential to move up, but only if I see something that significantly changes the game play or more of an explicit narrative with unforeseen twists.

What can be said about the current #1 game on BGG? So many things, but the problem is that many of of them would be spoilers. Spoilers in a board game? Yes. Basically, when you play Pandemic Legacy, you are playing a campaign where the choices you make in one game will have a great impact on how the campaign evolves. In addition, there are many surprises that unfold. The campaign has a very cinematic sort of feel as each game you play represents one month a year where the CDC has it's work cutout for itself. If you succeed in a month, you go to the next month. If you fail in a month you get to try and play that month again. Only one do-over however. So, the campaign will last between 12 and 24 games (averaging 18). Between each game, you can upgrade your characters, your network, or other kinds of infrastructure. In addition, months can have various mandatory or optional objectives. The campaign almost felt like the way you do a campaign in Starcraft 2: Wings of Liberty since there are between-mission upgrades you can customize and various objectives the game throws at you.

If you like Pandemic, chances are, you will really like Pandemic Legacy. Other than a few periphery opinions, most agree that when you're finished the campaign, the game is over. Some people feel you can keep playing on this customized board but, I don't think I ever would. I don't mind this as I had a really fun 15 games. In addition, I can use the Pandemic Legacy box to house my normal edition of Pandemic with all available expansions, which is fantastic. In addition, if I lose a cube or research station, I now have direct replacement components.

I might have even rated this a 10 except for the fact that they didn't design the physical components in such a way that the campaign could be replayed. This was the designer and company's intention, but that doesn't mean I have to like it. Despite knowing the various surprises that happen, it would be nice to introduce to new players, it would be nice to try different characters/upgrade paths, and for other spoilerific reasons. It's certainly an achievement in mechanisms and narrative story-telling, but I seriously dislike that this can't be replayed without modding the game or re-purchasing another copy. Thankfully, another season is on the way.

A fantastic experience that you really have to play through if you like pandemic. However, it has some of the symptoms of pandemic (quarterbacking/ability to let others lead), and can be pretty inconvenient to organise. Plus when it's done it's done. But amazing fun while you play through it.

After playing four games in a row, it's safe to say this is the most exciting version of Pandemic available on the market. It may be the most exciting board game on the market, period. Each game has been tense and a perfect test of teamwork. I'd rate it an eleven if I could.

End of campaign and not changing from earlier position. Not sure what could change it to a 10, but well worth the 9 for the experience it gave.
I'll add that I'm not a massive fan of normal pandemic, but the legacy aspects make this so much more fun. Having an evolving world with changing objectives keeps it being fresh and different each session making it so much more fun.

RATING: 3
A fun take on Pandemic, but legacy games have an inherent shortlife, so strictly following BGG's ratings methodology, this has little replay value for me and I've ended up with a hacked and modified board.  A fun concept for sure and definitely the best legacy game there is, but it is Pandemic and once finished, are you really going to replay it? 

My other gripe - applicable to any legacy game - is you need the same group of dedicated players to keep going.  This is a bridge too far and on that basis I can't recommend any legacy game.  So no replayability and a constant group is a bit hurdle for me, so I've knocked it down a point.  I may one day get my PL gaming group back again and finish the year, but I'm skeptical.

RATING: 7
Although I do not at all agree with its historic rise up the BGG ladder, this is still a great game. Its just Pandemic with some legacy mechanisms plopped on top, but those legacy mechanisms are admittedly really cool and fun to experience. The thrill of opening a new packet or acquiring a new bonus, is balanced with the anguish of placing an outbreak sticker on the board, or taking a scar. There are certain game changes that really liven up the game and provide huge narrative pivots, which help players stay interested through the twelve stages. The replayability argument is completely unfounded as after finishing the game, you will have already extracted more than your money's worth. Each decision made, and every card drawn has effects that ripple throughout the entire life of the game, creating a living narrative that you as a player have to struggle to control and adapt around.

I understand, and even partially agree, with lots of the detractors of Pandemic Legacy.  The rubberbanding is real, the plot is a bit generic, and the game is ultimately disposable.

But Pandemic Legacy is the most fun I have ever had gaming, so detractors be damned!  Pandemic is an incredible design, and this game is a great way to breathe new life into it.  I would heartily recommend this game to anyone.

Very easy towards the end of the 12 months to make it VERY hard if not impossible to finish if you lose a key character.

Rating this game is tricky. I've already played 14 games of it, which is more than I've played my two favourite games of all time, so far. I also won't ever play it again. It feels like the BGG rating system breaks when confronted with a game like this. I had a few good experiences with this game, and two or three absolutely brilliant surprises. However, overall, I was very disappointed and often annoyed by this game. One particular issue is that Pandemic can often just force you to lose with no possible strategic or tactical decisions that could have saved you. That's fine, it's a relatively short game, and you could just play it again. In Pandemic Legacy, you can't play it again, and you're stuck with a permanently ruined board because the game sometimes throws out an impossible scenario.

If there are enough surprises in it then I think I would enjoy Risk Legacy. I do not intend to buy any other legacy games that have yet been announced.

I've really enjoyed playing this, especially as a long time fan of the original Pandemic and On the Brink.

This is a lot of fun, but requires a complete and thorough re-reading of the rules prior to and sometimes during each and every game. You can't just learn it once and know it forever. 

A couple of things to point out. Often, the print on cards and stickers is small or low contrast, making it difficult to read.

Another issue is the clarity of instructions. It is not always 100% clear when doors or boxes should be opened. At a couple points during the game, I failed to open a box, even though I had satisfied the conditions to due so, simply because it didn't give me a simple reminder of exactly what those conditions were. It was up to me to remember a card viewed several games earlier to know when it was time.

La base del juego es la misma que el Pandemia normal, pero la campaña es muy tensa y te mantiene sorprendido durante el transcurso, la sensación de que no hay vuelta atrás y que la has liado es genial, aunque la campaña no se puede volver a jugar siempre queda el modo básico.

A great co-op board game. The main problems arise with the Legacy format. I like the progression and the story it tells, but the game reveals it's big surprises far too early.

Recommended for fans of puzzle games or those with a lot of patience.

[b]The components[/b]: I don't have any objections to the quality of components. The map looks exactly as the one in Pandemic (so very tech-y and clean, which I like). The stickers are also pretty recognizable once on the board. For a game that can only be played once, they could have easily used cheaper cardstock for everything and nobody would mind, but they didn't, which I think is great. I also love the little details that are everywhere. 

[b]The theme[/b]: It is hard to speak about the theme of Pandemic Legacy without any spoilers but still, I will do it. At the start, it is just like a standard Pandemic game. The story obviously evolves but there is one thing that bothers me - I think the stories in between months are too short. Sometimes, it is even as short as 1 sentence. I hope the story will be much longer in Season 2...

[b]The fun[/b]: Oh, I never thought I would have so much fun playing a legacy game! But I just love opening all those boxes, number and stuff and applying all the stickers! I just can't stop at one game and always have to play at least 2 :)

[b]The gameplay[/b]: At its heart, [thing=161936][/thing] is just like standard Pandemic. So if you like that great puzzly coop game, chances are really high you'll love this. If you can get over destroying your game, that is :) Also, it gets harder and harder every month which is amazing.

First impressions at the halfway point:

What is the game here?  


Is it the full 12 months?  If so, it seems really scripted and on rails.  Each game makes the next easier or more difficult to win/lose, but the same thing happens regardless.  It doesn't seem to matter if you win 12 in a row or lose 24 in a row.  I would have liked to have seen more if/then changes along the lines of the "if you lose 4 in a row, open box 8." Like "3 fallen cities, open box 9."  Maybe something like that is coming, but it doesn't look like it. It just doesn't seem like anything we do has any affect (besides making the next game slightly easier or harder).  Maybe the last half of the game will change this impression.

On the other hand, if "the game" is the individual game you play that time, I can appreciate the whole box as an elaborate series of mini-expansions and mechanism for introducing them.  Except you can't go back and play a version you liked a second time.  This makes the little rule snafus very frustrating.

Update: After the game sat on my shelf for another 6 months, my wife and I decided to "play" through the rest of the game by opening all the packets in order as if we had played and won each round. We didn't miss much. My initial assessment of the game being on rails stands.

I love Pandemic, but not legacy. Legacy concept seems better than it really is. I didn't like the large qty of open this box, add this sticker to the board, and another sticker, scratch this, rule changes, game interruptions, etc. I felt like more time had to be invested in play the legacy stuff vs playing pandemic.

After playing thru the first 4 months, I was annoyed with the legacy interruptions and trashed all legacy components and reverted the game back to pandemic core. Clearly this game was not for me.

A truly amazing design, that has had us on the edge of our seats in a way that no other board game has ever managed.  The twists and turns, and the way the game self-balances if it beats you up too much, are awesome.  Pandemic Legacy took the already ground-breaking design of the original Pandemic, and turned it into a remarkable story that you get to share with your friends.

This is one of the best games ever created.

For someone who doesn't like cooperative board games, I'm having a ton of fun with this. I picked this up after I realized my girlfriend and I had a lot of fun playing regular Pandemic. She loves Legacy, which is partly the reason I probably like it so much. 

So I really just like this because it's a game my lady is continually into and is willing to play often. 

I do want to say something to boardgamers that like this a lot: Go play some dang DnD with a proper DM.

Update: I've completed it, and I guess that's an impressive amount of value in the game. The narrative was largely disappointing, barring a few big surprises. The end is anticlimactic, and the fact that you're evaluated on a rubric you're not privy to is infuriating.

I think the rating is largely composed of people who didn't finish the game.

Some weird gaps in the rules, but a beautiful narrative, a welcome expansion to the Legacy... well, legacy, and beautiful production. I think this may have permanently supplanted the base game.

With every game i play i lower the game's rating.
No, this game ain't good as its average rating may let you think. The mechanics are too simple to play 12-24 games. 
There's a lot of luck, you can draw 2 epidemic cards in 2 turns and there isn't anything you can do about it.
And the luck factor will increase as the campaign progresses.
Most of the times you have an only choice, and any error can mess up everything.

2016-11-27: Very good game but to long for my taste. We started playing 4th of December 2015 and ended on 26th of November 2016. That's almost a complete year!

It is a good game of course, it is pandemic, but the length and a lack of surprises during the long run, drops it a bit. I think I actually put regular pandemic at 8.

Probably only ever rating: 7 (which includes a bit of extra goodwill because of the experience feel after all. The last few games dragged on and I wasn't to enamored with the experience then so it is actually closer to a 6 than an 8)

Excellent game. Highly recommended for anyone who likes pandemic.

In regular pandemic, winning can feel like a bit of a letdown. Here you're just happy and relieved that no more permanent damage happens to your board. Also you will sometimes get greedy and try to win more in order to get better options for game end upgrades. I love that. 

Difficulty was perhaps a bit lower than regular pandemic. 

Gameplay has a few twists and new mechanics that really suits the game well.

I wish I could go back and experience it all again. But like with everything else, you can only experience the first time once :)

Never played Pandemic before purchasing the Legacy edition Season 1. And, we never played a Legacy edition game before either. We were hooked immediately. It is an amazing game, as the rules, characters, strategies, and story develop based on your actions, reactions, and number of games played. It is brilliant in almost every way & changes what playing a board game means. Best to play with the same group of people through each month of the season. We cannot wait until Season 2 comes out!

I like this because it is built on the foundation of a great game (Pandemic), and adds in surprises and narrative development.

My first four plays were not that interesting to be honest: too much like Pandemic and parts of expansions that I had already played. But things changed dramatically, and I am at least in the "fan" camp now, even though it's going to need to really blow my mind to rise above 8 (mostly because base Pandemic is so good in its own right).

10 plays in, and this game feels like a chore. Simply too many small rules to remember. I like deep games - heck, COINs have more rules - but the small rule changes every game make it impossible to immerse. I'm tempted to drop rating to a 4. I would rather play base plus a single expansion. I doubt very much I will play Season 2.

Players' roles evolve and new gameplay elements and strategies are constantly introduced. This is Pandemic on steroids!

Wow, just 2 plays in (both losses) and we've had a great time.  The few subtle changes that they've made so far are great.

After playing through March we've added so many new things.  This campaign gets better and better.  It will be tough to go back to vanilla Pandemic at the end of it.  I may have to check out the regular expansions or borrow some ideas from PL to create my own house rules.

After May, this is one of the best gaming experiences I've had.

Hitting July-Sept, the new mechanisms and changes to the storyline have been great.

Just completed the game, having lost December twice.  Nice ending to the story arc.

Overall, this is a must-play game that everyone should experience.

I really enjoyed the legacy mechanic. My group made a mistake towards the end which made it almost impossible for us to win in December. That was a little bit of a let down, but overall we had a good experience.

Man, playing through this was a trip. I originally rated it a 9, and for the time it was accurate.

Nearly a year later, however, I'm ranking it down to an 8 simply because I've moved on and lost enthusiasm for the Pandemic concept overall.

RATING: 10
This game gets 'everything' right. Not only is the game progressing nicely, but as we are playing it in a family group, it makes us meet each week to complete a month per visit to the table. 

I really like the fact that the game is changing as we play, and I have no worries whatsoever about it's replayability after the year is completed. In fact, we're simply looking forward to season 2.

The only game I've played where cleanup is almost as fun as playing. This suffers from the same issues of quarterbacking as the pandemic usually does so if you were looking for something that solves that issue this is not the game.

RATING: N/A
Mid-campaign thoughts: revolutionary and masterfully designed, gameplay is tight and offers a good and challenging coop experience, rule changes are interesting, hidden content is exciting, the theme is not my favorite though and is not immersive: the story bits are very brief and the art very limited (only box and character portraits), unlucky card draws can spell doom from the beginning, permanent changes to the board/components increases fear of failure, to me sometimes more stressing than enjoyable.

Hate this game, we bought it without ever been played regular Pandemic. So we discovered don't like Pandemic at all, with the legacy aspect it become worst. Have to play a game that you don't like for a huge campaign... not a good idea. The game is to simple and easy for my taste for cooperative  games.  Also as a legacy thing, I can't even re-sell it, maybe I burn it.

최종 평가: 4인 팀원으로 플레이 하였고, 팀원 중 한 명은 인생 게임으로 꼽기도 하였다. 스토리 몰입감은 생각보다 약한 편이지만, 위기가 닥쳐올 때 압박감이 몰입도를 올려 준 것 같다. 시즌 2를 기대할만한 시즌 1이었고, 모두 함께 끝까지 플레이할 수 있어서 즐거웠다.
고정 멤버가 있다면 꼭 한 번 도전해 보시길!

- 생각보다 잔룰이 추가되어서, 텀이 길어지면 게임 보유자는 꼭 룰을 한 번 점검하고 플레이해야 한다. 사소한 에러플이라도 생기면, 팀원들이 이겨도 이긴 것 같지 않아할 수도 있어서 몰입감에 방해가 될 수 있기 때문에, 게임 소유자는 되돌리기를 하고 싶은 상황에서도 룰을 정확히 지켜줄 수 있어야 한다고 생각한다.

Yeah, the hype was real. Me and my wife played this together, and became hooked. She often wanted a second game, a third game, gotta find out what happens next. It's not good because you tear up cards. that has nothing to do with it and I fear some people miss that. It's good because its a story, a book, a movie, and things have to change because the story keeps moving forward. 
It's an experience.
no resets, a problem? I can't unwatch a movie or reset my day either. why would you want to.

Nehéz társasként értékelni a játékot, mert egy teljesen új vetületet hoz ebbe a világba. Igaz, hogy egyszervégigjátszós, de cserébe olyan izgalmat, olyan történetet, olyan karakterfejlődést ad, mint semmi más. És mindez a rengeteg irány ellenére érezhetően ki van egyensúlyozva, ami hatalmas meló lehetett. Tényleg olyan, mintha egy film közepébe csöppenne az ember. 
Ráadásul sokszor már nem is a játékon, hanem a játékok közti történeteken, fejlesztéseken van a hangsúly. Ezeket néha még jobban lehet élvezni.
Ha mindenképp kekeckedni akarok, akkor is csak egyetlen kérdés merül fel bennem. Vajon a 85. legacy játék is ezt az érzést fogja hozni vagy addigra meg fog kopni az újdonság varázsa. 
Talán mindegy is a válasz: 10

RATING: 8.5
Enjoying this quite a bit more than standard Pandemic. I don't think it's the rule changes or long-term effects, per se, that make it more fun, but rather simply the raised stakes. The level of immersion is dramatically increased by the knowledge that changes to the board or characters could help or hinder you for months.

Been playing using a friend's copy. Very good game, though the fact that players are permantently punished for losing (with City distress levels rising), while only temporarily benefited (funding cards) really dampens my mood when playing. getting punished for winning (losing funding) also sucks. I'd definitely recommend playing, well worth it, but it would be nice if future seasons only applied city distress permanently when you win. RIP Santiago.

While I admittedly don't love the base Pandemic game, the curiosities (including but not limited too super viruses, boxes you can't open, world events, and a fairly fluid fairness modifier depending on how successful your party is being) of legacy made this version one of my favorite board games to play.

If you played Risk Legacy you know the strength of the word "Legacy" in a game title. Seeing the card getting ripped within the trailer brought back the most awesome feeling I had playing Risk Legacy.

Amazing for what it did for legacy games, but ultimately found it very frustrating. It is the opposite of what I wanted in a game - felt like it got more and more complicated as well as depressing.

Played it all through and finally lost saving the world;(
Beautifully designed but I guess we ourselves broke down the game by waiting too long (sometimes two months) before having the next game session: after such a long time we had to relearn the (new) rules again and again, making it less fun right before starting the session. Thus, my advice is to play the season in relatively fast and continous flow, in order not lose attention and fun.

RATING: 6
The 'Legacy' series isn't exactly something I am interested in, but as it is the #1 game at the moment and I pride myself on the hobby, it's only fair that I played it. I was actually surprised how much like Pandemic it is. It [i]is[/i] Pandemic, but with rule changes happening as the game unfolds. Perhaps it is an even more exciting experience for well-worn players of Pandemic who expect one thing and then have to deal with another. It was a journey, however. Good stuff was that it brought good people together and we got to live out a board game experience. Bad stuff: I found the game by the end lacked an interesting narrative, engaging storyline or did anything wild or innovative enough to release it from the chains of its base game. After the MAJOR PLOT DEVICE was introduced, there really was nothing that developed the game significantly afterwards. By the end, it really did feel like 20 games of Pandemic with increasing amounts of mud. I think there are opportunities to do something truly exciting with the Legacy genre if you're tight enough with a storyline and let that story inform your game design. Otherwise it can just fall flat, as I largely feel from my Legacy experience after 20 games. Still glad to try the number 1 game for the foreseeable while, but Pandemic Legacy doesn't come close in my mind to what makes gaming a great experience.

I'm someone who liked Pandemic but didn't love it until the In the Lab expansion.  That being said this is a very fun game.  The decisions you make impact not just the game you're playing, but all future games, in truly meaningful ways.  Although I guessed the twist, I still found the story involving and interesting.  19/24 possible playthroughs took two players well over 20 hours to beat. Definitely felt that the amount time and enjoyment was worth the purchase price and look forward to Season 2.

Legacy system in a coop is such a perfect pairing. This game really invigorates pandemic and lifts it to a new level. The story aspects are great and everyone is enjoying the challenges/changes the game throws at you while also enjoying the benefits of an RPG like system.

The difference between this and risk legacy are that, everyone gets to enjoy the good with the bad where as there are some more individual aspects to risk legacy because you are still VS each other. Also pandemic is just a better base game than risk

Everyone should play through and experience this game if they have a group for it. Or even just play 1-2 people and use multiple characters!

RATING: 10
12-2 with 3 players. 875 points.
This game is exceptional. It is building on the very simple and fun mechanics of Pandemics and adds a Legacy twist to it that changes everything. I like Pandemic but I am not a big fan of it. It feels like cleaning a blue board of little plastic cubes and that's it. Characters are nameless and even though collaboration is essential, the game gets very hard and depends a lot on luck with more than three players, which is quite frustrating as we can only use a very limited pool of synergies between characters each game.
Pandemic Legacy fixes all that for me. For the first time, I would consider playing 12+ games in a row. Each game adds a mini-expansion and tweak to the rules that feels very unique to our game - because even though the tweaks are scripted, their influence on the game is very much unique to your board; and that is enough to deliver a very exciting experience each time.
Also, the difficulty of the game scales up perfectly so that the game remains perfectly balanced - this is quite impressive.
Each time a big (morale?) decision comes up, the group has to weight pros and cons, not knowing what comes next in this game, but also in all future games. And that makes each discussion exciting, fun, intense and meaningful.
The game is not excruciatingly hard and punishing which keeps it fun, it is just the right balance and still feels you had to be at your best to beat the game. I still think it could have done a better job at leveraging down the difficulty for 4 players. Also on the downside, I think the game hasn't fixed the alpha player problem that was already in Pandemic and in fact is making it worse here because now we don't even have to hide our cards - which means the game could be played solo with no problem.
It is the first game I see somebody at the table saying 'this game is amazing' out of shear excitement.

RATING: 7
This takes the core game pandemic (a good game on its own) and adds a smattering of lightweight campaign options and role playing. It is really great fun. I would recommend people look into this market of campaign based gameplay further though as I feel the scoring people have applied to this game is a bit dramatic. I'm in no way saying Pandemic Legacy is bad (it is a really awesome play through) but I have played better campaign based role playing board games *cough* imperial assault *cough*.

After April - rating lowered by 1.

After September - rating lowered to 7. The theme and action is no longer satisfactory.

EDIT
After finishing the game - the desire to play it is 1. :)
But overall the experience was 7. After first 1/4 of the game it was 10, than gone to 6, and at the end was about 7. 
To not to spoiler anything I must say I was expecting more. More story, plot, whatever. More interesting changes in the plot and more engaging goals.

Pandemic is a good game. Pandemic Legacy is something else.

I love the idea behind legacy games, but they seem to work best in a system that is known well (ie. Risk). Pandemic at this point is a well know system. And it works well!

I definitely recommend playing with the same reoccurring group. Pandemic Legacy tells a story and a good one at that. However, after playing through twice, there are many overlaps. It feels much more linear than Risk Legacy (but, that's not a bad thing).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Loving it. Halfway through the campaign now. Full of surprises, and strategy is always changing from game to game. Sometimes I wish for my decisions to have more impact in the story arc. The luck factor (e.g. first infections) will also sometimes decide the game before the first turn. But... The story is really cool, and love experiencing all the new things together with my group. Highly recommended for anyone who's enjoyed the original Pandemic. If you're new to Pandemic, try a few "dry runs" (ie. without permanently changing the game) of the first month to get familiar with the rules and strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I am always skeptical of anything that becomes quickly and overwhelmingly popular. Pandemic Legacy (PL) made a lot of board game reviewers' top games lists, with many of them rating it their #1 game of 2015. I was also hesitant because of the "consumable" nature of the game (you have components that permanently alter the game, and you can play it, at most, 24 times).

My worries were unfounded. The hype was real. What did I say to myself just after finishing my first PL game, despite it being late at night and being tired? "I want to play another round. I want to see what happens next." PL echoes the success that serial dramas have had in recent years on television. You get hooked on the plot, and you care about the characters.

As for the consumable nature of the game: do the math. You'll play the game -- assuming you enjoy it -- a minimum of 12 times. How many games in your collection have you played at least 12 times? I'm guessing not many. There's some games I've only played once or twice and that are just sitting around.

NOTE FOR SOLO PLAYERS: Maybe you're like me and hate the "quarterbacking" aspect of co-op games, where you feel like you don't have much choice during your turn and you're merely doing what's optimal play for the whole group. Yes, you can play this game single player. (You can with *any* co-op game -- Forbidden Desert is great.) Simply assume multiple roles. I've read three works best. Also, use some kind of marker (such as the 4th pawn) to indicate which character's turn it is so you don't lose track. And keep pawn colors consistent to help you remember who's who... e.g. I always use the pink pawn for the Researcher character. This game is probably one of the best solo play experiences out there because PL is such a narrative experience. You're not merely counting up victory points as in some games -- you get to experience a great story as you reveal cards in the Legacy Deck.

I don't love the Pandemic system, but the legacy aspect put this in the "must play" category through a full campaign. Now that more legacy-style games are being made, it's unclear if I'll play Season 2.

The game* is okay, I played the complete season with a friend in a 12h session. Far too easy 2p, I think we should have played it with two additional "virtual" players.

I am basing this more off of what my friends have told me than my actual play. I don't really support the whole legacy game idea, at least in how it's executed here.
To be honest, I don't like Pandemic much, so the low rating is probably more to do with that.

This is the pinnacle, as of the date of this writing, of the Legacy games, blows Risk Legacy out of the water. The amount of history and background flavor this game provides is crazy!! Definitely the best game of 2015. It helps that Pandemic is already an awesome game.

I had no idea what this game would be. I love it. I am only in June, but I am addicted to it like my favorite TV mini series or like one of the best books I have ever read.

1. So after two goes at January, Atlanta is rioting, we can never build a research centre again, the blue disease (The Patriarchy) is rampant, and we're all doomed. I ripped up a card as directed and it was both traumatic and liberating at the same time. Cannot wait for February.
2. We survived February! Very tense, and it was really only by the skin of our teeth. Still, we have a decent set of research stations added to the board now. And a bonus for March! Hopefully it can help us fight the Patriarchy.

Pandemic is already a great co-op game, but the Legacy elements make it truly fantastic. Yes, you can only play it 12-24 times (depending on failure rate) but every game is unique and the twists, turns, and new things you reveal as you play through are more exciting than I thought they would be.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
At about March I decided that I simply cannot stand Pandemic as a game, and playing 18 or more hours of it was going to be too much. I endured to the end scoring well enough, but have since removed all versions of Pandemic from my collection. The game fails to reward learning and success. There is no risk/reward in this game and once you are playing at an optimal level you are essentially watching the unfolding process of a game you are no longer capable of controlling. The legacy system is exciting and I look forward to the many ways games can benefit from this, but I do not believe Pandemic was a good pairing for it.

/Mindblown.  It's like Christmas morning every time you get to open a box or reveal a sticker from the dossier.  I've played 45 games of regular Pandemic, but in none of those games did I feel the pressure I had in game #1 of Pandemic Legacy. The threat of those stickers! Wow. So intense!

UPDATE: We just made it through July.  Enthusiasm in the group remains strong.  Excitement for Season 2 is already active.  One of the best board gaming experiences ever.

UPDATE: Just made it to the end of November.  Nice.  :)  Should wrap it up in one more game night.  Looking forward to it.

We bought this and started playing vanilla pandemic to get started since known of us had played before. Other people really like it but this isn't much fun for me and we never actually got to the legacy part.

Based on entire game.

Excellent game, which gets eveything spot on narratively, but flubs the gameplay for December for me just enough to niggle, but not enough to mar the rest of the experience. I think weather I gave this a 10 or not was always going to come down to how well it nailed the ending, and it didn't completely flub it to invalidate the enjoyment I'd been having the rest of the campaign, but it wasn't quite right for me, gameplay wise at least.

Pandemic on its own was a fine game, but the legacy gimmick turns it into a unique and superlative experience.   The cliched plot twists seem right at home in this melodramatic race to save the world.    There's a good reason this game has been sitting at the top of the ratings.  It's an emotional investment unlike anything else I've played.

Looking forward to playing through this with Sam as we mock up our year from hell. I know the twist of the first month but no more and will try to get Sam to take more of a lead as don't want to quarter back the game as that just wouldn't be fun. Keen to play this with Sam though as feel it would be good to share the story together.
*4 months into the game and really enjoying the game. Will wait until about 9 months in before rating but can fully understand why so many have it as a 10, as a first to play a game that Sam wants to play again after only a few days. Also this has/is helping get me through the weeks ahead!
**currently on 2nd game in October and rated game as a 10 - brilliant story and just play it without looking ahead so you can get the most from the fantastic story as it unfolds before you. My wife has wanted to play this every few days (never had her want to do any gaming that frequently, let alone the same game- so demonstrates how good it is). Only thing to note is that some people have said this would be a great gateway (sort of agree as it shows what gaming can be) but it does get a little involved as extra things are added to the mix. Brilliant game though!!!!

I didn't want to comment on this game until we finished it.

This is the first game I've played that has been at the same time fun, frustrating, exciting and stressful. I would do it all over again. In fact, we all said we weren't sure if we would enjoy vanilla Pandemic the same again.

On replay ability. We got 15 games in. That's more plays than any other game I own. Well worth the investment. At full retail that's $5 a play. I would buy another copy and do it again.

I had harsh things to say about Risk Legacy, which boiled down to this: competitive games must have winners and losers, and it's not fun to lose a game for months with no recourse, and to have that loss made permanent.

RATING: 7
It's a good game, and a very interesting experience, but most of the appeal comes from its unfolding narrative. How much this idea appeals to you will probably determine how much you're likely to enjoy Legacy.

This game is rather over-rated (as of writing, it has been number one game on BGG for many months; in my view, it doesn't deserve a top 10 placing). The campaign is, I feel, over-long for what it is (I would score the game higher if it was a somewhat shorter experience); unless you do a lot of gaming, you're committed to playing Legacy as your main or only gaming for months on end. The campaign aspect makes it interesting, and is generally well handled, but introduces some problems (more on this below). 

Having an evolving campaign works well with Pandemic. This is firstly because it's a solid design that has had massive testing "in the field"; in short, the Pandemic engine is a great foundation on which designers can add new elements with relative confidence that it's all going to work.

Secondly, Pandemic Legacy fixes an issue with co-ops: namely, the "one player is an expert and tells everyone what to do" problem. Here, no-one is an expert after the first month or two, because no-one has played this particular version of the game before.

By continually dropping in new elements, the game is narratively exciting, but the constant change means that players never get to truly experiment with the game systems, because the situation is always changing, particularly in the late campaign. This means that you never find out if things would have been better or worse if you had done Y instead of X, as you won't get to try Y in a similar situation, because next time the situation will have moved on. 

The changing nature of the game theoretically has you thinking on your feet, but I would argue there is comparatively little information on how the interlocking elements work, so this is limited. This means you get the situation where one player strongly feels you should do something, but no-one really has a truly strong basis on which to agree or disagree, because there isn't time to get to know the game (although to be fair you're going to get this situation to some extent even in "known" games due to human nature).

One interesting side effect of the Legacy concept is that it gets players talking about game systems much more than they typically would (but if your group already talks in detail about game systems after playing, this may not be so big a change). 

With regard to rating, this game doesn't really sit well within BGG's rating system (it's a one-time-only affair, so the rating descriptions just don't apply). Therefore, I'm giving it 7 to reflect how much I like it (i.e. a fair bit better than average). At the start of the campaign, I'd have given it 9, but I have liked it less as the campaign has become, because of the increasing "wacky stuff happens" factor (as noted above, this is narratively exciting, but, for me, makes Pandemic Legacy less satisfying as a game).

Beginning the year of Pandemic Legacy is a treat. It is Pandemic with some persistent elements. The additions are great and wrap you in more and more, until about halfway through. After about 6 months, the game adds rules and missions that are not nearly as interesting as the early mutations. Even more, each successive month has a need to add a new tweak or rule. While tight and as good as ever early on, Legacy grew into something I liked less as the year advanced. It is a unique experience, but the game hit a peak at the mid-point and fell from there.

I'm 5 months in.  I expect that I might update my rating once I complete the game however, for now. I totally get why it is #1 on BGG right now.  

I can also say the the "legacy" game system is incredibly interesting to me. I know some people have concerns or are frustrated by the lack of "replay-ablity". In my personal opinion this is a major part of it's charm.  I'm excited to finish the game.

Note: Two of the people playing with my wife and I, NEVER PLAYED any form of Pandemic prior.  After 8 or 9 turns of the first game they were playing like seasoned vets.  So if you are thinking about picking this up without having played Pandemic before, I would encourage you to do so.

Apart from the excellent storytelling aspect, the most intense part of this game is how current decisions have an impact on future games. The only sad thing which keeps me from giving a 10 rating is that this game only shines when you play the entire campaign with the same group.

Edit:
Heck, I'll raise my rating to 10. By now we played P:L 10 times in a row and I simply cannot remember any other game which was such a hit with my gaming group.

It is a new spin on Pandemic. Finished December recently. Amazing experience. High level of polish and clearly significant play testing.

Highly immersive (surprisingly) enjoyable plot, high quality components.

Losing 1.5 for some ambiguous wording on cards, high luck fact in infector phase can be frustrating,  and obviously no replayability (once only we got 17 games out of it)

Absolutely was a blast as we went through it, but perhaps a little long in the end.  I can understand why there were 12 months but let's say that all weren't nearly as interesting as the others.  This game will likely kick off a spate of other legacy games, for better or worse.  If you're a fan of co-ops and have a group that can devote 15 or more plays to the same game, I say go for it.

The absolute worse variant to pandemic is open hands.  It LEEDs to a controlling person dominating the game ( and any co-op needs to ovoid this). With one"s hands being open information as the standard in legacy, it destroys that basic tenant as drastically deminshes the social aspect of co-op game.

I won't rate this until I've played further in but here are some running thoughts:

January: I really like this game so far.  It is definitely still the familiar game of Pandemic but with a feeling of real consequences to each decision.  Events from the legacy deck have been interesting so far.  The way things play out feels a lot more like video game design with scripted events rather than a board game.  In that regard I'd say it's a successful hybrid.

April: Still interesting. The plot has been good so far and each month has had a different feel.  Mechanically it is the same game but the events spice it up and incentivize the next play.

The highest expression of boardgames of our time. The hype is real, the bgg ranking is true, all your board gaming friends are right, this is as perfect as they come. Pandemic is, already, an easy to teach cooperative game that showcases the virtues of boardgames without falling into any of it's vices. You and your friends can work togather to save the world, how awesome is that? What Legacy does, is bring in a narrative that makes that theme shine as bright the sun. No movie, no videogame can give you this communal experience. Every game matters (won or lost), it is consistently surprising and, in the end, it is a masterfully crafted story that you can live through game.
Already purchase a second copy to play with my gf. If you haven't, you should play it too.

I'm on my second play through (now in May) with a second group and am enjoying it as much as I did the first time even knowing most of what's coming. The game is dynamic and, so far, seems to allow multiple play groups to have a good chance at success is strategy and tactics are good. Both groups have used the Dispacher and Researcher every game thus far, but the first group relied heavily on military resources from their introduction while the second group has completely eschewed them while maintaining very similar success rates.  I can't speak highly enough about this game and have great anticipation for Season 2.

I realize I'm in the minority here, but in playing with my girlfriend, we found the game way to fiddly in that you have to constantly add new rules and try to remember the old ones at the same time.  It really bogs down play and often leads to mistakes during the game, which are especially frustrating as you're permanently marking up the board. 

I dig Pandemic, and appreciate what this game is going for.  I can totally understand why people love this version, but for me, reading new rules every so often is not fun.

RATING: 7
Yeeeeah. So.
This isn't as good as I thought/hoped it would be. Make no mistake, it's very good--but the Legacy format isn't really shining. For one, everything is scripted in a way that Risk Legacy wasn't. For another, the new stuff that the boxes and stickers introduce is mostly just a subset of the stuff Pandemic lovers already have in the expansions.
You see, I still prefer normal Pandemic with the first expansion, because it has tremendous variety and customizability. Lots of roles, events, and options. With Pandemic Legacy, you just a small subset of that locked in month on end.
So, from my perspective, don't believe the hype--especially if you're like me, and you think Pandemic doesn't really sing until you add On the Brink.

The game had lots of up and downs, but overall the boring parts outweighed the exciting parts. Often I was dreading having to play the next month as this game started to become a chore rather than being exciting. Additionally, for a campaign style game, the end was the biggest cop-out imaginable. If there had been a solid ending, something that made me feel like all my work had been worth it, I probably would have scored this substantially higher, but to find out that it's a score your points situation (for a game I'll probably never play again) I was devastated. It will be a long while before I can trust a legacy game again.

Based on first 6 months:
Pandemic is not my favorite game, randomness can really make a game impossible or too easy. It can also suffer a lot from Alpha Player Syndrome.
That said, the legacy system and its narrative really makes you invested in the game, making you feel despair when you realize a game is lost (and what that will mean for subsequent games) and the feeling of ecstasy when you win a game in the nick of time. Transforms an okay-ish game (Pandemic) into a great experience.

Rob was a favourite designer before his Legacy popularity. This is a very entertaining way to play a game, probably helps that its not my copy too!
But I am playing this thru with a bunch of hardened historical tabletop gamers, and they are loving it. From napoleonic armies and winding down with some ASL, to gateway euro-cube-plonking is about a big a leap as you are going to get. So it must be doing something right!

RATING: 8
As I write this, Pandemic: Legacy has taken the top spot on the BGG rankings, and not without cause. This is an experience unlike any other game (with the possible exception of its predecessor Risk: Legacy). However, as much as I enjoyed Risk: Legacy, I feel this type of game actually works even better as a co-op. Risk: Legacy sometimes led to moments of players colluding, not for selfish gain or mutual benefit, but simply to "open more stuff". When all players are working together by design, this type of behavior feels more sensible. Rewarding players for things they want to do anyway is a mark of good game design. 

As the game progresses, more and more complexity is added and at a rapid rate. Unfortunately, a lot of the complexity is a serious pain to track. By the end, nearly every city has special rules associated with it, the player actions have tripled in quantity, and it is very easy to forget some of the necessary bookkeeping that needs to occur. I'd be shocked if ANY group has ever played through the whole thing the first time without a single instance of inadvertent cheating. I think all this bookkeeping is worth the hassle, but it is a serious strike against the design.

I have high hopes for games of this type in the future and eagerly await Season 2!

So in exchange for some weak-sauce "scenario", you get a game that nobody can use again. This is absurd-level consumerism, and that trend should be fought against.

Quite a good game, somewhat better than I expected. For now I quite enjoy it and I'm excited to see how the "story" progresses. I'm a little concerned about the extent to which each game ends up being truly different, it seems like the main differences will end up being in terms of which cities riot, collapse, etc.

Hopefully I can convince the same group to commit to Season 2, but we'll see if they still have the stomach for it after finishing the full Season 1.

The legacy model is totally crazy to me. I'm not convinced that there are any well justified game-play reasons for destroying the game.

Final thoughts after completing the campaign.
I really thought it would be better. I have really mixed feelings about this game.

The pure gaming experience is at the same level as normal Pandemic with expansion(s), just different. I liked some parts of the scenarios that changed up the basic Pandemic game play but also disliked some things that just felt tacked on.

The story was pretty unimaginative, but still had some redeeming twists.

The legacy aspect is fun (it's always exiting to open new "doors" or packages) but also a little bit disappointing. I wished the player actions had more (ie. any) influence on the story. I felt like the game drives the legacy aspect more than the players.

A time line:
After a couple of games, Rating 8:
Like normal Pandemic, but with some extra bits and bobs ans surprises that makes it a bit more interesting. Interested in what the next game will reveal. 

About halfway through, Rating 7.5:
The legacy bits of the game seems to be more affected by what the game does than the decisions of the players. The story that is told is not affected by the players' decisions. The "stickering" is mostly used to reduce bookkeeping between games. Also disappointed by a very unimaginative story.

A few more games, Rating 7.2:
Each new scenario just seems to add a tacked on mechanism that really doesn't contribute much to the enjoyment of the game. The "advent calendar" aspect of the game is what keeps it interesting.

Almost finished, Rating 7.4
The story got a little bit better. Still feel the same about the mechanisms.

Finished: Rating 7.2
Pretty boring ending and I found the scoring odd. We did well though.

Looking back at the experience: Rating 7
Didn't stick as something exceptional. Would have liked some branching story lines.

Definitley suggested to those who enjoy classic Pandemic and would like a progressing story along with it.

RATING: 8
(02/12/2016) Comment based on 4-5 plays.

Pandemic Legacy is a stroke of genius, taking the ever popular Pandemic cooperative game, and making it a "legacy" variant similar to Risk:Legacy. The game has an overreaching story arc that flows through 12-24 sessions, which represents a year of time in the Pandemic world. The components may be written on, ripped up, or modified by adding stickers. New rules are incrementally introduced throughout the year, allowing the players more actions, as well as potentially powering-up certain character roles. In some cases, some of the available player roles can be permanently scarred/damaged and even killed. It's like a soap opera in a board game format. You don't know what will happen next, and it keeps drawing one back because they don't want to miss an installment.

There is a sense of mischievousness when one is told by the game to deface it or to destroy specific components. Normally, this is unthinkable, but in this game format, it is encouraged. However, this means that the game will never be replayable back to its initial state. Also, after the year campaign is over, the game needs expansions (and hence the designations of "Season 1" and so on) for it to continue. At $40-$60, having 12-24 sessions with Season 1 may be on the expensive side, but it is great fun. It is a form of RPG, where the players do tend to get attached to certain characters, and as such devastating when one is killed off. It is sort of like the characters in Game of Thrones, where every character you get invested in will get killed. This is clearly the next evolution in board game design, where each session is unique, and the campaign world is irrevocably and permanently altered. Because the players are more invested than usual, and since there is a sense of finality, there is more tension than a usual recyclable game. This is for keeps.

Components are very good. Rules are well written. The graphics is much more stark, with a sense of urgency when compared to the original Pandemic. Unfortunately, there is a touch excessive downtime when prepping the game, as well as after the game, where permanent alterations are made. The game doesn't suffer from alpha-gamer syndrome that plagues most cooperatives, due to the unknown nature of the unfolding story. There is some downtime during play as well, but the design ensures that all players remain engaged regardless of turn order. The game somewhat requires a long-term committed group, although players can swap in and out between sessions and not miss much, so it is similar to playing in a moderate-length RPG campaign. Rating: "8". It is a great design, where I will gladly play my friend's copy, but no need to get my own. Still, a unique gaming experience that every gamer should have at least once.

[b]OH SWEET JESUS

"Are Legacy games for me?"  No, no they aren't.  Asking the question [i]is[/i] your answer.

This is an experiment in emergent narrative told through mechanical gameplay.  The physical game is the engine that drives the story forward, but it's not the "thing".  The thing is what goes on inside you, how it makes you feel, the stuff left over when all the bits go back in the box.*

And it's fucking [i]genius[/i].

[microbadge=37534] - [i]São Paolo, Lagos, Kinshasa, Seoul.[/i]

[b]After 11 plays:[/b]  After a bumpy start due to the other three players taking it [i]very[/i] casually while I held true to my solemn vow to avoid alpha-dogging it, everyone woke up to the permanence of letting things slide, doing your own thing "just to see what happens", and [i]losing[/i]—so much so we've become a crackerjack team of 11-fingered dike pluggers, not having lost a game since [i]before[/i] April.  At first I thought we must be getting a rule or five wrong (not unusual what with the constant parade of new stuff) or maybe we just got a bunch of lucky shuffles; but discussion and dissection of the games showed that we were just making good, well-timed decisions.  

And that feels pretty cool.

[b]After 16 plays:[/b]  Reversion to the mean is, as they say, a bitch; we has got our comeuppance.  The world is duly fucked.

[b]After 20 plays:[/b]  Final score of 618/1000—which is a D-minus (!)—but the game grades on a curve so while civilization might have lost an eye and has a permanent lisp it can still ride a bike.  Hooray?

Our only regret was 

[o]not using the nuclear option to cut one of the major transmission nexuses—it would have saved us a ton of grief to have done so.  What stayed our hand was the belief that such an event would only further the enemy's goal of global destabilization, as well as the (emergent narrative) karmic debt of murdering millions of people just to make our jobs easier...  In the end it turned out that if we [i]had[/i] used the nuke it would have actually [i]increased[/i] our score and resulted in a better outcome—which is weird.  Filling in the blank in [i]Hiroshima, Nagasaki, [c][u]        [/u][/c][/i] should always be seen as a tremendous negative.[/o]
[b]The wrap-up session report:[/b]

[article=22635754][b]Don't stop for love she screamed.[/b][/article]

[b]For those with "concerns" about the one-shot/non-replayable aspect:[/b]  While we had great fun with this for four real-time months, [i]I wouldn't ever want to play it again[/i], rendering the massive amount of effort required to make it "resettable" a huge waste of time.  So what about the thing itself now that it's been "bricked" and is "useless"?  Well, we did get 20 plays out of it, [i]which is more plays than I've gotten out of 90% of my collection of 400+ games.[/i]  

Let that sink in.  

In that regard we got enormous value out of it.

I like Pandemic well enough but based on what I read I didn't think Legacy would be worth getting.  I was wrong.  The legacy element makes each game much more meaningful.  We now very much care about how much bad stuff happens even when we win.  I think it will be hard to go back to regular Pandemic when we finish our Legacy game.

A year ago, I would have never thought I'd be able to play this in any sort of capacity...but after finishing it last night with a win in less than two months, I feel privileged to have partook in such an incredible experience.

Bucket list item checked off.

Oh my word was this fun and memorable! The whole campaign was intense, cinematic, engaging, enraging all the while hard to beat, but intuitive to play.  My mother-in-law and I played through the blah while curing blah, while we blahed our blah to the blah.  Sure we got some rules wrong here and there but that didn't hinder or facilitate the gameplay by any noticeable degree. The only complaints I can think of was the organizational chore that encompassed a large amount of setup/teardown time (depending on opening up classified goodies and game upgrades) and the fact that it's now over until Season 2.  Those two minor things don't affect the actual gameplay; therefore Pandemic Legacy receives my highest recommendation.

NOTE: I know my plays say only 12, but I'm too lazy to input them at the moment. Trust me, I played through the whole campaign.

In general I don't overly like Pandemic; it's fine, but I'm not a co-op player at heart, and the base game does little for me but provide an activity that I'm never really that invested in. I like the Legacy mechanic though, and those elements are enough for me to rate this game a bit higher at 7 (whereas I rate Pandemic 5.5 at current). I don't really agree that this game deserves to sit in such a high ranking across ALL BOARD GAMES EVER, but it was fun to play every couple of game nights until my group was done (we played the entire Season across roughly 13 months real time). If I had to play this even 2 weeks in a row, let alone all 12 scenarios across 12 consecutive game nights, I would have been very unsatisfied and rating this much lower, because it doesn't scratch that "gaming itch" for me like other (*ahem* competitive) games do.

The legacy mechanic is very well integrated into the game. I guess the designers learned from Risk Legacy and maybe it's a bit easier to incorporated the legacy mechanic into a cooperative game. But you still do the same every session strategy.wise. Recommended, though.

The game is expending from play to play, although I want to know, how it will end (we just finished september), it feels more and more redundant. The story tries to tell you something else, but all the suspense comes from luck of your card drawing. I initially rated the game with 7, now I rate it down, because it feels redundant and nearly is consumed, so we won't be able to play it again some time.

Simply ingenious. I never liked Pandemic but this game delivered an experience I was craving for a long time (and apparently I was not the only one). We really had a fun time playing through this and because of the scale of its inspiration and Innovation that is working/balanced so well, this absolutely deserves a 10.

RATING: 9
I was never into Pandemic, but everyone raved so much about this game that I had to get it.  I would recommend that new players get several regular Pandemic games in before committing to the Legacy game.  It takes a while to get a feel for the game and what is important and what is not, and in a Legacy game, you don't want to be 1/3 of the way through the experience when you "figure it out".  That being said, the game was fantastic.  While I was playing it, I thought "this is decent", but the more I think back on it, the more I really want to play it again.  I think it deserves the hype it got and I can't wait for season 2.

Great experience, but I have to be honest when we finished the game I had the feeling that "Okay, It was cool, but I don`t want to play any Pandemic again for a half a year" :D 

I really like Pandemic Legacy, but playing through the whole season is pretty exhausting. A lots of rules to remember, a constantly changing environment, components etc. I totally agree that it held the nr. 1 spot for a long time, but how should I say...I recommend it, It`s a must, a really wonderful game and I`m waiting for season 2, but I don`t want to play it through again. I rather play base Pandemic, with maybe In the Lab expansion.

Even though the rules mostly read like regular Pandemic, be sure to thoroughly read the rule book. It is very easy to miss a few important things (like how to use the purple reminder token).

EDIT: Currently in August. Each play session seems to take two hours; set-up takes a bit to do, reading the new things being added to the game; refreshing on previous new things, etc. If play sessions were back-to-back, some of this time would certainly be minimized, but we tend to play once a week at most, once a month at fewest.

The fault of the game is scheduling the game with the same people.  And if you have busy lives picking up where you left off you somewhat forget what happened a bit not that it makes a big deal.  The real problem is the making sure to follow the instruction correctly and not opening the wrong thing or flipping the cards at the correct time.  It just seems some of the things are not always clear.  Did we do the last month correctly?  Its not like you want to redo a month if you did it wrong by accident.

I rated this game a 3 because I likely won't play this again.
I did  not dislike the game, I enjoy a game of the regular pandemic every once in a while but the campaign style of the game just didn't suit me. I felt obliged to finish this, I was thinking about finishing it in a reasonable time-frame while we still remember what we're doing etc instead of wanting to just play the game because it was fun. It lost all it's appeal to me because of that. I ended op selling it for components halfway through the campaign. It wasn't WOW enough to keep me coming back for more.

Best co-op game played to date. The game never fails to entertain and never gets boring or repetitive.

Every other game was set aside until we finished this one.

I plan on checking in on my rating every few games and updating accordingly. I'll keep a log of them here:

Rating 7.5 after 4 games played (2 in Jan, 2 in Feb) - Cool, but not a revelation.

Rating 7 after a few more games (we're into May now) - We've had a couple big mechanism changes/additions, but none of them really change the feel of the game. Each individual game is still not terribly note-worthy. Games tend to have pretty obvious best moves, and the infection deck either thinks you're lookin' purty tonight or it smashes your face with a brick. That said, the narrative arc _is_ clever, and the Legacy deck is inspired. It makes the Legacy concept work in a way that Risk Legacy never did. Still worth playing, but I'm glad I didn't buy it myself.

Rating 5 after Oct.1. I was pretty well done in September or so, though will finish the year out. Don't really care what happens now, however. Looked ahead at some spoilers and feel like one of the December thingies is really stupid and reeks of awful game design. They have somewhat spent the rest of the series conditioning you in one way, and then without any warning (as far as I can tell) they do a complete 180.

Missed one rule around Sept/Oct which would have seen us open another package.  It really messed up November, so had to undo the game and revert the board based on pictures.  It is something others have had an issue with as well.  

If you get to a card which reads "if you haven't opened package 6 or 7" it means "if you haven't opened BOTH packages 6 and 7, open them now"

Excellent twist on the Pandemic license. The Legacy aspect makes your world ending failures that much more difficult, but your world saving achievements that much greater. Finding out what was in that next box and playing with the same group over repeated plays makes this a must try game.

I also did a Red campaign but I'm not listing it twice.

I had reservations when I saw where this was taking the board game idea but now that I've played through April and enjoyed every moment I have been converted.

So far it has fallen flat for me. I started playing it with my family but we didn't really enjoy it and gave up around May. I've now started again with my gaming group, but it seems to has fizzled out a little bit already in April. I tried solo play, but that wasn't any more fun, just quicker.

It just seems too mechanical and work-like the storyline although interesting, isn't enough to pull it back together. Feels like more a puzzle than a game. 
We are playing it now just to see it through to the end. But it does feel a bit of a chore.

It's a tough call for a game to be good enough to hold off all the other great games for at least 12 plays.

Would be a 10 if not for the sometimes confusing rules explanations, other lack of information and the fact that the game plays very different in terms of difficulty with different player counts, as far as I can tell (like "plain" Pandemic too).

RATING: 10
I have never played a game that is more engrossing than this. I probably have some sort of undiagnosed ADD or ADHD and so often times I'm bored waiting for my turn in some games.

Not so with this one. There is SOOOO much going on - do we spend our time putting out the fire in south america or do we let that go and work on getting a cure for red?

There is no alpha gamer syndrome in play here because there is so much to do, it's like, we have to attend to all of it, so go go go! 

Each game is a fight to the finish and we are always having to make touch choices about what is our priority. Save a city or make a cure, often times you can't do both in the same turn and so you risk much.

What updates should you take after each game? We can spend 20 - 30 minutes after each game trying to decide that one thing. 

Even just trying to figure out which crew to take out that month can be an agonizing (in a good way) group discussion. This one is better at curing but this one is better at treating. 

So much tension!

Such great love for a game that really knocked it out of the park!

We are done! It took us a long long time to finally finish the game but here it is. We ended up doing December in two attempts! 17 games! A first for our family. It took us almost two years to finish ;)

We just finished July! That was an intense and very interesting month! We failed June once but we finlly made it to the end of July! 

Getting close to the end of the game. We just finished October after almost a year without playing the game. October was one of the toughest month we had to go through. September was not easy either but we managed to finish it in one go. Time to see what's coming next, during the last two months of the game.

Following on from the game changing Risk legacy, Pandemic Legacy flips the model on its head by applying the Legacy model to a co-op game to mind-blowing effect. The evolution of the journey is fascinating and I love the fact that we regularly play this with 5 players as it is very much a team effort versus a ruthless AI. 

Another absolutely must for all gamers - a sublime journey. It only misses out on top marks as Risk Legacy was the first, the benchmark, and the experience of Pandemic while brilliant is somewhat lesser than Risk legacy.

RATING: 8
While I never really got into Pandemic, I really loved Risk Legacy, so this was a must-buy for me. 

Started out as a 9 for me during the first 7-8 months, but then felt way too linear to merit a 9. 

Further, in the German version, due to a translation issue, we were not prompted to trigger the right rule additions and game elements in November, so we played that month completely wrong twice (I heard the English version is rather ambiguous in this case, too).

The Legacy mechanism is a sustainability nightmare that devalues a board game worse than driving a new motor vehicle off the dealership lot, and like a car salesmen the publishers are laughing their way to the bank. A short term narrative gain is not worth the loss of replay ablity. I'd rather play a campaign.

Full disclaimer: I love legacy games. Or at least the ones I've played so far. Pandemic Legacy took what was a decent but IMO relatively unremarkable board game, vanilla Pandemic, tweaked it slightly and made it amazing. Each game is close, but never feels like it's completely out of grasps or clearly within your reach. The modifications between games add to the story line and make the game more fun, but don't over or under power the players. The only major downside I'd say is the concluding stages are a bit anticlimactic, but nothing is perfect. :)

Originally purchased it to see what the fuss was all about. Initially it really hooked us, each game we felt like 'we wanna know what happens next!' and eagerly awaited our next play session. The destruction of components also initially felt liberating, we all spend so much money on this hobby and here I am setting fire to it but what the hell.

However I feel that the novelty wore off for us. It seemed to stop us from getting other stuff on the table, also a few mistakes here (including rules) and there feel like it messed up the whole thing in a not very fun way.

Zomer 2017. Schitterend coöperatief spel; soort gepimpte en gepersonaliseerde versie van Pandemie. Tijdens het spel ontstaan onomkeerbare wijzigingen op het spelbord, in de spelregels, met de personages, etc. Geweldig gevonden en zeer goed uitgebalanceerd. Enige ervaring met de klassieke versie van Pandemie is aangewezen.

Great game, though I'm surprised people consider this to be the best ever.  If you like Pandemic, definitely get this.  If not, I'm not sure you'd like this.  We found the rule book to be confusing, and the whole thing is pretty fiddly.  With those things said, one of the coolest gaming experiences I've had.  Definitely recommend playing with a set group of people and avoiding too much time in between sessions (we didn't play for like 3 months at one point and I think that hurt the experience).

We're about to start June as I write this and we've had a lot of fun with it.  We started with just me, my wife and daughter and lost the first two games.  We started to win once my sister jumped in and we've reserve playing it just for times she's at the house.  One note of warning, it's VERY EASY to forget to check for when new cards should be revealed. We forgot more than once and even had to completely redo a month we had won but had forgotten to reveal cards at the beginning of the month. So be VIGILENT with the cards.

The game deserves high marks for breaking new ground in a gaming experience.  It's a wonderful concept, and it plays really well.  It's better than traditional Pandemic from a pure enjoyment factor, although it obviously requires a far bigger committment.  I haven't finished the campaign yet, but I can confidently say this is a solid gaming experience.

RATING: 7.5
If you like pandemic then this is a no brainer. 

For myself, liking pandemic but not wanting to play it that often due to the fact that no matter how well you play, if the cards come out in a bad order then (without knowing it) you've lost before the game even starts. The legacy system doesn't change this, it just helps mitigate being unlucky/lucky multiple games in a row.

The legacy mechanics make it so that if you loose a game then the next one is slightly easier, and every month (2 games per month if you loose one of them) the game gets harder. Also every game you play (win or loose) gains you 2 upgrades before the next game. Basically the 12-24 games  that you play are one giant diffuclty balancing mechanism. So if you find yourself on a loosing streak, then the difficulty increases will slow down while the upgrades still come every game and the bonus for loosing occurs too.

The other thing that the legacy system brings to the table is the developing story, as the months go on, new rules/objectives/components/roles etc are added which makes every game different, and depending what decisions you have made, and which cities have had outbreaks, the game state will permenantly change each game as well.

RATING: 9
(The following is all spoiler free.)

Final Thoughts (with 2 players):
The game is excellent.  If you like Pandemic, you need to play this game.  All my negative comments that I'm about to make are minor quibbles on an amazing game.  My main complaint is that the game was too easy and was especially too easy in the last couple episodes of the story, so it felt like a bit of a letdown after the excitement of the middle episodes.  One of the main problems was the funding mechanism, which gives incentive to lose on purpose at the beginning of each month.  There needed to be a penalty added to the empty-deck loss condition so that we couldn't just use that as an easy way to get extra upgrades and funding with no cost.  Even after fixing that, I'm not sure the last episodes are climactic enough, and that's something only the story writer can fix.  I have lowered my score from 10 to 9 based on the last episodes.

In all, it was an amazing experience and I do not regret the purchase and play of this game one bit.  I would do it again.


Old/detailed notes:
Pandemic was already one of our favorite games and this just takes it to a new and better level!

One warning, make sure to follow the setup rules and don't assume you know them based on the original game.  I made that mistake and it kinda ruined our January mission (we essentially had Funding 8 since I just stuffed all the cards in like in the normal game, oops).  We also goofed up on virus upgrades the first time around, thinking we got them as an eradication bonus without spending one of our upgrade slots.  So, after January we had an easy win and too many virus upgrades.  Since it's Legacy (and we are playing the destructive way) we can't really go back and fix it, so we just moved on.  My thinking about our path is thus.  We could have taken intentional loss in game 1 to get 2 upgrades and keep funding up.  We would then enter February with 4 upgrades and 4 funding.  Instead, we enter February with only 2 funding and 5 upgrades (3 virus, 1 lab, 1 skill).  I think we're still coming out ahead, but can't really think of anything better to do.

2017-10-28: Just got it, still in wrapper.  So excited!
2017-11-17: Won first mission (January).  So cool!  Though we messed up some rules, oops.  Zero outbreaks.
2017-11-20: Lost second mission (Feb).  Again quite fun.  The revealed stuff from the Legacy deck for this mission was great.  We took an intentional loss to keep our funding up and get more upgrades.  So far as I can tell, if the board state is right to prevent all outbreaks, then there's really no downside to just letting the deck run out as the loss condition.  Not sure if this is good strategy, but it seems favorable.  We had one unavoidable outbreak (Khartoum) before the decision to lose, but after that we got to eradicate one virus to upgrade it and didn't have any more outbreaks.
2017-11-27: Win Feb.  Man, this one was super easy.  We started with 3 yellow in hand and drew into cure on turn 3, followed by eradication.  One of the epidemics came on yellow (ignored!).  It was so easy in fact that we had several turns where we only took 1 or 2 actions due to the board being empty.  Zero outbreaks.
2017-11-28: Lose March (intentional).  Zero outbreaks.  Since we now have a nice stack of upgrades built in to help us manage the board, things are actually getting easier rather than harder as we go.  I really think this sandbagging trick is overpowering to the game.  Still, we're having fun.
2017-12-11: Win March.  Zero outbreaks.  The strategy is working very well.
2017-12-12: Lose April (intentional).  Zero outbreaks.
2017-12-22: Win April.  Zero outbreaks.

RATING: 4.5
Disappointing experience.
Have only played first month. It felt very similar to regular Pandemic (obviously, since initially little has changed at the outset). Regular Pandemic is bland and almost plays itself. No meaningful decisions, as the optimal moves are more or less obvious.

I still want to try to play it more (due to the hype and to experience how it might change), but it left my regular playing partner (my wife) cold. I will have a very hard time convincing her to play again. This was not fully evident when we finished our first game, so we did apply all the Legacy stuff during and after the game.
 
Playing it with others will be less fun (at least initially), as the game has already been used and they won't be able to experience it from the start.

Am feeling quite stupid to have followed the legacy "mechanic" faithfully. I'm annoyed that a single (almost test) game has ruined the experience for later plays with other groups. 

The Legacy mechanic is interesting but it increases the cost of an unlucky purchase. You are ruining the resell value of the game, even after just one play.

As a consumable, I suppose it breaks the mold (and some of the things inherent in the rating system...)

it's an interesting game design, and I think we'll see the style evolve so, , perhaps, my rating will change relative to changes in the style - but I am basing my rating not on game design analysis  and just on pure experiential enjoyment.

FWIW I played it 2 player (2x2 which is totally viable given the open co-op style) with my wife and just had a blast with her. I think it makes a great couples game and the evolving narrative sort keep things moving.
I mean not only does it stay fresh, but that there is an end keeps the ball rolling as a "project" to complete

the weigh is relatively light so participation is "weekday easy" when people are a little drained, but the evolving rule set keeps the rules from being trite since there's a freshness.

as far as no replayability value...well the only misgivings I have there is the materials waste (but honestly, if I look at packaging in general. it's not so bad. I home designers just keep in mind to try to keep "hard components" re-purpose-able)

but as a value proposition I have zero qualms about the non-replayability. I certainly got an entertainment experience and moreso than many games.

It's very good, of course. We're either very lucky or it's a little too easy -- we're in August and have won every game so far. Setup and rules are getting more annoying with every game, it's starting to become too many things to fiddle with. But the experience is incredible. #1 game? I don't think so, but it really is great.

Love that this made Pandemic have stakes. The original gets dull over time with the same group, but the legacy version turns that on its head and makes it very very awesome. You start caring about your roles. There's some decksploration, but not quite on the level later seen in T.I.M.E. Stories

The game was fantastic.  I loved how things changed over the course of the game, and there were many surprises that were both frustrating (in a good way) and awesome.

RATING: 10
This was really a remarkable experience that my spouse and I had playing through this game together.  The legacy components work very well, and the game does a good job from the get-go in shaking things up so you realize This Is Not Your Usual Pandemic.  The basic model where the game is now "over" for us (until Season 2!) was well-worth the trade off of having the raised stakes and unfolding storyline as you play.  

I would recommend coming up with a theme for the names of all your characters--the way folks back in the day would have a motif for naming their servers--and having fun following it.  We went with animals, and there will always be a fondness in our hearts in particular for the adventures of Dr. Hedgehog-Warbler.

Playing through the game does ruin you for a little bit on playing ordinary board games, as games without a legacy element that seemed story-rich subsequently feel a bit more like, well, just games.

2 years to finish! Group doesn't have much desire for it.  It does seem to get monotonous if constantly playing the same role

though it is cool to play a much more complex pandemic, it was too long. It should be cut from 30 hours to 20 hours.  Many games felt too similar. The last third of the campaign picked up speed. 

Time is running out card needs to be clarified.  FAILING to open 11 was disappointing.  

MISTAKES took this rating down.  Could be 8.5

An interesting view that may increase rating: if I played any other game for 30 hours or 25 sessions, would it be better than pandemic legacy?  Or is it a downfall to have to commit to 30 hours?

Wow! Believe the hype!  

I'll be honest, that I was a fan of Pandemic before this game, so yeah, I'll buy it.  However, my kids don't enjoy the regular Pandemic game as much as I do, so it doesn't see much regular play time.  

After two games, my kids are loving this game.  We've had the two most dramatic finishes to game than I could  ever remember.  The game makes you really care about what happens in the game, because events affect future games. No one wants their character to die.  You're invested in the outcome of the game like never before.  I don't know of a game experience that has ever been so intense and exciting.

It's fun to see what is revealed next in the legacy deck, top secret dossier, and player packages.  It's agonizing trying to decide what upgrades are best to get and which characters to bring into the next round.

Initial Rating: N/A

I dislike when people rate a game without playing it beforehand (to me, it doesn’t make any sense) so I won’t rate the game. I don’t think I will ever play Pandemic Legacy, still I want to share my opinion about the game.

I heavily dislike Legacy games. I come from a third world country and since I was a child I was taught to not generate waste, so the idea of permanently change a game is anathema to me. When I do that, I lose all the financial value of the game (I cannot sell an used copy if I want to) and I facilitate the generation of waste. I’m sure all the Legacy games could be done in a way that you could reset them to their initial estate without losing any of the fun and/or surprises of playing through them (examples of this that come to mind are T.I.M.E Stories, Mechs and Minions and Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Rise of the Runelords – Base Set). I understand that the permanent change is the whole point of the Legacy system, but I cringe every time I see a friend tearing the components of the game. I know I’m in the small minority here :D, but that’s the reason I dislike Legacy games, for me those games are really disposable and that makes me sad.

I won’t ever buy a Legacy game.

I was lukewarm about this title when I heard of it, as I'd not had the pleasure of playing Risk Legacy.  I'd seen about all the base Pandemic I needed to see.

This experience is as much like an RPG, or a season of television, as it is a game.  Pandemic engages me much more when each game has consequences lasting into the next, when new events and objectives are revealed, and when characters develop from game to game.

As of the beginning of September of my first campaign, I expect to finish this campaign and perhaps play a second time.  If Pandemic Legacy were available for mobile devices I would buy it in a second.

Games where you tear up the product you bought, or use stickers so you effectively have 1 full playthrough aren't worth buying.  Boardgames should be replayable, not consumable.

Pandemic Legacy is one of the most interesting and unique game experiences I've ever had. My initial rating is only after 4 plays, so it might change one way or the other when we finish the game, but I really do think it's something special. It's very much like Pandemic, but with these subtle, incremental changes that add depth to the game with both their immediate effects and the anticipation of future effects.

RATING: 6
As someone who only plays regular Pandemic two or three times a year, the prospect of a dozen sessions in a concentrated span of time doesn't have tremendous appeal to me. I lost interest after the first few sessions when it became apparent that the story is fixed (i.e., your decisions don't affect the narrative in any way) and that each month becomes increasingly complex and takes longer. I know I'm in the minority, but this just isn't for me.

(Side note: I'm not sold on the legacy concept as a whole. I'm just not sure about a game that ends up being unusable after it has been played. Tearing up cards, putting permanent stickers on the board, and winding up with a box that isn't even able to be traded or sold goes against my sensibilities)

Unbelievable! The already great game gets better as, over the course of twelve "month" scenarios, the rules change slightly to make it more intense and more challenging... and your group will love the changes each time because it never lets you feel totally overwhelmed at all. My only disappointment is that, to replay it, you need to buy a new copy and start all over again.

PLUS: makes a great game even more challenging
BIG PLUS: new challenges don't overwhelm you
HUGE PLUS: new challenges increase the fun level
MINUS: replay is limited, two different boxes but same game inside

RATING: 9.6
As we continue the game, I fear that enjoyment of the game comes more from winning than losing.  Of course, that may be true for many games, but I really hate the game when we lose and love it when we win more than other games I've played.  I'm still enamored by Pandemic in the Legacy format.  The fiddly bits are even more fiddly, but at least I'm able to remember when to place a sticker or add a rule, etc.  

SPOILER:

The addition of "search and rescue" missions has really bumped up the enjoyment for me.  I hope these continue throughout the remainder of the game and provide better rewards.

This comment will be updated as we go on, as well as the rating, as we continue further into this very interesting "Legacy" system.

RATING: 10
Well after 18 games, we finished the game. One of the most fantastic, immersive, exciting experiences with a board game ever. The legacy format works so well in a coop format. Normal Pandemic is a so so game, once you have played it a couple of times, but PanLegacy is another beast entirely. More linear than I had anticipated, but it just works perfectly. 11/10 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
While Pandemic is a fine game, the legacy element is an emotionally and financially abusive system that adds nothing to the game and takes too much. If the idea of a co-op puzzle game about curing people appeals to you, you should get Pandemic and its expansions and play that. Pandemic Legacy itself should be avoided like the plague.

RATING: 8
Should this be considered one game in multiple parts or 12-24 separate unrepeatable experience games? I have assiduously avoided reading much on this game lest I diminish the experience of playing. I won't give anything away that you won't know before you start your first game, which begins just like a regular game of Pandemic until you draw your second epidemic card - then the changes come rapidly and unpredictably.

There is one variable aspect (again, that you learn before you begin playing), in that every time you lose a game your funding level goes up (which equals the amount of helpful action cards you have in the player deck) and when you win it goes down. This sort of self-correcting difficulty level based on past performance is genius. There is little else I can say other than every game is a bit like opening a Christmas present with a new game inside. 

For the great experience this game is, I can't score it higher. I am playing it two-player and there is a growing disappointment at that player count in that the objectives tend to favor the use of just two or three characters and the others don't make sense to use given the needed skills. I don't think this would be an issue at four players. There is also a part of me that feels it is merely a (genius) marketing gimmick - and disposable games feel like a terrible waste of cardboard and plastic (I'll pirate as much as I can for other games). Even though it is much harder for me to find 4 players with the required consistency, I will do so before playing Season 2!

First plays are nice, ending months are unfulfilling. Story 'twist' is expectable and the game plays the same for each round, 3 cubes somewhere, go there, fix it. Searching is dull. Risk Legacy solves that by increased variance due to competition. Get Risk Legacy instead.

This game just gets better and better as you progress through the story. I never played any pandemic expansions before this, so everything was such a huge surprise and added a ton to gameplay. Even losing was still great as we got to rethink and upgrade for the late portion of the month. Can't wait for season 2!

After 7 plays:
Upgrade from 8.5 to 9.5.  Best new game I've played this year, after 6 months of the campaign it's only getting more exciting and more interesting.

While I love the game and it's my favorite new game of the year, I do feel there were a few mis-steps on the designers part:
-It's very easy to mix up Package #s and Door (advent/dossier) #s.  The numbers should not have overlapped - Dossiers should have started with 9.
-It doesn't scale well down to 2 players/2 characters total.  Way too easy.  We ended up doing 2 characters each/4 characters total.
-SPOILER BELOW


SPOILER
-End of September/Paranoid Soldier: I disagree with the rules as written to allow the traitor to be an unused character.  The whole point of that event is to have a significant emotional, strategic & narrative impact, and the best way to do that is make it be an in-game character.

I do really like how it scales the difficulty based on your wins and losses, it fine-tunes it very well with the funding cards.  It's pretty brilliant how the funding cards act in two ways - they give you special abilities, and also their very presence as a physical card means that the epidemics will be more spread out.

My grades for each month, based on what it adds to the game (SPOILERS!)

Jan:
A+.  Very exciting, having one disease mutate and become uncurable was cool.  Loved the upgrade options.

Feb:
A+.  Adding the quarantine stuff and having C0dA become not only uncurable as before but now even untreatable was a fun challenge.  Relationships between characters was a neat twist and worked well.

Mar:
C-.  Felt like a "filler" episode.  Military bases are just weaker Research Stations, at least at this point.  So other than a powerful new character, there wasn't much new and exciting as far as rule changes.  It felt like just busy work, we were just building military bases to have something to do, to work towards, it didn't really help combat the diseases. 

April:
A+.  The game is back to form, the Faded mutation is awesome and literally a "game changer".  This makes C0dA even more dangerous.

May:
A-.  Roadblocks are a cool feature.  The new character (Colonel) seems a bit weak.  The increased incubation rate nicely amps up the pressure and makes sure all the C0dA regions become Faded.  And, the experimental vaccine is now available - we will surely need to use this soon, as we have lost twice in a row! (Both May attempts).
EDIT: It turns out we obtained the experimental vaccine in error - we opened Package 8 instead of Window 8.  The rules were unclear and we opened the wrong thing.  Thankfully, after the June game we realized our error and put the experimental vaccine back unused.

June:
B-.  Seems like another placeholder month.  The new Soldier character is also a little weak (can't discover cure).  Might be best in a game with a lot of people.  The equipment is pretty cool though, better than Military bases were when they were introduced.  Grenade Belts and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells are particularly cool equipment.
(Edit: Revising this grade to A-.  The soldier, in combination with the equipment, turns out to be REALLY powerful!  We had him keep on throwing grenades at the faded figures, then picking his grenade belt back up.  Unfortunately I was spoiled to this strategy by reading the FAQ and seeing the Q/A that he is allowed to pick up and use the same equipment card multiple times in a turn - but, it is an effective strategy!

July:
B-.  I'm a little conflicted on this month.  On the one hand, it seems like they are saying there's so much going on with the game, at this point we're just going to add "mini-games/satellite games" (the search for the virologist).  On the other hand, it is a pretty cool way to add some narrative and theme to the story.  And, I did like the mechanism of "hunting" for the virologist, and epidemics pushing our hunt closer to ending in a cold trail.  On the other other hand, it was anticlimactic when we found her, b/c all we got was the gene sequence of C0dA, but we have no idea what the implications of that are.  We thought it would be some really cool immediate benefit, but instead so far it's just thematic fluff, at least as far as the game has revealed to us (I'm assuming it will be one item in a "collection" of things we will need to fight C0dA, but the game hasn't clarified this).  So, B- but flirting with C+.

August:
C+.  Another "Search," this time for the Immunologist.  We found our "checklist" of needed things for the cure, and as we thought one of them was the item we got from the Virologist.  Virologist character is introduced in this month - we thought she'd be a big help, but she turned out to be a bit of a dud - the whole game she only drew one C0dA color, so she didn't really get to use her power.

September:
A+.  Another "game-changer" month!  Losing one of our best characters (Soldier "Goose" van Gogh) as a traitor was devastating.  Great story-telling with the Paranoid Soldier discovery.  Ironic that we've been building up the military infrastructure and now we have to tear it down, but, they've sold it well and I'm buying :-)  Great month.

October:
A-. Satisfying resolution to finding the Immunologist's requests!  Can't wait to start vaccinating.  Cool new components and mechanics.  The vaccination mechanics address the military base sabotage "loophole" in the previous month of building a base just to sabotage it - now we really do need to get rid of the starting bases.

November:
B+.  Kind of a place-holder month, but I understand that for those who struggled with the searches, this month will be their only opportunity to use the newly-uncovered results of the searches (thanks to Team Bravo).  It was fun vaccinating the Faded Cities and getting some breathing room (especially since we had 2 shots at November... it might even be strategically better to lose the 1st November game so you can vaccinate even more before whatever's coming in December...)  We know at least we'll get an Epidemic in December thanks to the board spoiling that with an extra infection rate - they should've been stickers!

I love pandemic still to this day.  I don't need the gimicks, the 3rd grade level "story telling" (I have an imagination I don't need B Movie script writing to improve the experience.  I also don't care about destructive elements to the game if there are additional components to replace what you "fixed" or destroyed".  perhaps if they had expansions with replacement components and new missions I would be more excited.  I understand why the masses like this game, I get it but I am not easily swayed by gimmicks.  I hope everyone enjoys this game's time under the sun because it insures several years of people trying to create the next Pandemic legacy and I really don't look forward to such dark days for gaming.  We have reached the pinnacle where people try to out do the next game by coming up with new mechanics and new ideas.  Instead, its lets paste on a different theme, use the same mechanics and try to "replicate" the last hit.  Our gaming hobby is starting the backward slide.

I truly enjoyed Pandemic.  Pandemic Legacy was a solid game that was play tested to perfection.  That said, completing it was a chore.  It was a truly fantastic game, but my personal take away is that I will never play a Legacy game again.  It is too difficult to get everyone back to the table at the same time and with the rules constant changing and the gaps between plays, rules questions, problems, mistakes happen too frequently.

NOTE TO OTHER REVIEWERS: Careful with the spoilers!!! Don't even hint at what happens without a spoiler alert! (rant off)

My review (spoiler free):
Own both Red and Blue versions (playing with 2 groups).

I admit I was surprised how high the current Avg Rating was before I played it. I don't feel like any game truly deserves a 10 because nothing is perfect. However, I own 400+ board games and it's been so long (if ever) that I've been this excited about playing a board game. 

I am giving it a 10 because I really want this game to be wildly successful, so companies make more games like.

The only thing that might be a negative is the experience eventually ends. On the flip side, that very thing is what adds to the uniqueness and intensity when playing each session.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
This one is the most difficult to rate of all games I have played. On one hand it brings Pandemic to a new level. After finishing the game I certainly want to play another which of course is a good sign. On the other hand, the permanent changes in the game sometimes made me not want to play it as I was tired and didn't want a poor play ruin my chances in future rounds. These two arguments should lead to the rating 7 or possibly 6 in terms of BGG:s suggestions. On the other hand, I can't restart the game whenever I want which qualifies for the 1 rating, a broken game. The game is very expensive so it's unlikely that I would buy it again. Knowing what will happen and also knowing the large time investment which is needed makes me going for a rating 3 - "Likely won't play this again although could be convinced".

As a side note. It's incredible and ridicilus how this could be ranked as the best game at BGG. One thing is that the audience is biased, the people who didn't like the original wouldn't invest time or money in this one and also the fan-boys where quick to buy it. Another is that many persons doesn't re-evaluate their ratings.

Well this blew my socks off.

Its like a TV series box set - a thrilling narrative develops with unexpected twists and turns throughout.

Likely the best gaming experience I will have this year, if not ever.

Record so far is 13 games (3 losses) through October after cruising through up until April, and again stumbling in 2 close games in September & October.

Finished! Final score 790/1000, 15 games played. Easiest 10/10 I'll ever give, roll on season 2.

I played the whole campaign solo. It was very tense and exciting. I think it would be a much tougher game Co-op because solo I could think several turns ahead and determine the optimal play for each character. Several games were determined by not having something go wrong before I could complete the final actions. I felt like I was binge watching a great TV show but I could control the action. Well, sometimes I could.

RATING: 10
An extraordinary game. I had played the original Pandemic more than a dozen times when it originally came out, and while I still held it in high regard - it didn't have the same thrill for me. With that in mind, my hopes were relatively reserved as to how they could attach the Legacy trappings to it.

I was blown away. It hasn't ever happened that one game has dominated our weekly game nights over the course of several weeks. And yet every time we were able to get together, this was on the table. Maybe it was just because we wanted to plow through the campaign before anything was spoiled for us, or maybe we just wanted to be among the first to be able to claim to have completed it. Or maybe it was one of the most engaging, most memorable game experiences we'd had in some time. Playing this was a reminder how solid of a game Pandemic is, and the pacing of the plotted story was exceptional as far as how the narrative elements played out gradually upping the stakes and the tension.

It suffers a couple of the same drawbacks as the core game - pure bad luck with card draws can quickly destroy your chances; which happened to us on more than one occasion. But despite getting ground in the wheels of game a few times, it spun a wonderfully integrated story. Not every moment of those 18 games were memorable by any stretch, but certainly there are multiple instances that I will remember for years to come. When you look beyond the discussions of whether it's a good game, or the harbinger of doom of a consumerist attitude that will kill the hobby, isn't that lasting impression the most important part? That a group of people (in our case 3) got to experience and enjoy the tale that this game creates [i]together[/i], sharing in the victories and defeats, and relishing in the creation of our own unique gaming experience... You can't ask for a better result than that.

The game may be finished - and all but trash at this point - but given the option to go back in time and save my money, I'd spend it again in a heartbeat.

Surprisingly, except for the legacy part, this is Pandemic. The legacy part spices up the game by 'saving' where infections have happened, rewarding victorious and even failed fights against infections, thereby customizing the game experience of each group. All this happens along a developing storyline I'm looking forward to explore further.

The added attraction of the legacy part at least compensates the loss in replayability once the game series is done. Hence, same rating for the time being as vanilla Pandemic.

After three plays (two January losses, a February win), basically I want to binge in this until there is no more.  It was the most fun I've had around the game table in along time.
Edit Jan 2106:  The standard BGG rating scale really doesn't apply here, because the story is so linear that once it's over there is no reason to play again.  I personally have no interest in seeing a slightly different version of the story, so what's done is done.  Having said all that, I think we all came to this game with low expectations, and were very impressed at how compelling it was, and how it was THE TOPIC that dominated our conversations, and it's all we really wanted to do.  Bravo!

Por mucho que se diga que es una experiencia, un juego de mesa es para cuidarlo y disfrutarlo cuando te apetezca y con diferentes personas.
Éste sin embargo se convierte en una obligación de jugar con los mismos, una partida tras otra, con pequeñas variaciones.
Estas variaciones son el bombazo de esta versión legacy. Que me parece muy buena idea, que es una experiencia y que es darle emoción, pero se debería hacer de otra forma: vender la campaña como una expansión para el pandemic normal, en una cajita con su sobre de cartas y componentes de usar y tirar, y no que te compres todo un juego entero y lo vayas destrozando.
El no destrozarlo e ir con cuidado, no lo recomiendo, si te compras esta versión es para hacerlo todo.
Personalmente en nuestro caso, vivimos la experiencia y acabamos tan hartos de jugar y jugar al mismo juego (porque de lo contrario si juegas cada mucho tiempo, ni te acuerdas de cómo ibas), que al final nos dio igual que quede un pandemic normal con pegatinas chulas, que ya no queremos más pandemic.
Sí que hubo un par de meses que molaron las cosas que sucedieron, y sí que hubo un momento al principio que vivías emoción de que las decisiones que tomases tenían consecuencias, pero el resto de meses fueron bastante poca cosa y nos fueron decepcionando. No comprendo que este juego esté el número 1, con los juegazos que tenemos hoy día.

If you know the game, you know that a "used" Legacy game is problematic.  Once we are done with it, I am going to clean it up as much as possible...suggest some rule changes due to the nature of a used board, and give it away for a cheap trade.  If you are a huge fan, buy it new...but if you are luke-warm on the idea, make me an offer and I will probably accept it! :)

The game provides hours of co-op fun, but the last 3/4  months were tedious. The constant new rules and information makes it all pretty convoluted and by the end of the campaign, it just wasn’t much fun anymore.

I love Pandemic and this was no exception. My wife and I had a ton of fun playing it. From game 1, there was that feeling of anxiety because you didnt know how one thing you did would affect the rest of the campaign. 

Part of what this fun was the unknown although the game play is solid as well. After finishing the campaign, I have yet to play it, but I suppose it could be played as is, but I would rather play regular Pandemic.

I would play another campaign in a heart beat though, its a lot of fun.

It is an extraordinary achievement in boardgaming history. The "Legacy" concept is perfectly suited to a game like Pandemic. They fit seamlessly into one another.

The game is tense, frustrating, challenging, frightening, and triumphant -- most of all it is engrossing. One is completely swept away by the story that Pandemic Legacy tells. It is a pleasure to play this game.

Bravo and hats off to Leacock, Daviau, and everyone else involved in producing this. [i]Shut Up & Sit Down, Rahdo Runs Through, DriveThruReview[/i] and Zee Garcia all named it the best game of 2015. I am in total agreement.

This game accounts for my most memorable moments of gaming of all time. It took 4 days to play through it, with 2 weeks between each one, and it was incredible. In between games, we'd talk and text about it, read about other people's experience, I'd think about it in the shower or before going to sleep. Not only is it a great story, but how they modified the mechanisms and made them much richer, makes for one of the best games ever.

RATING: 10
If you enjoyed Pandemic, You'll love Pandemic Legacy!  Legacy takes everything that was great about the original game and adds tons more.  Of course, you'll have to unlock this new content and it's well worth it.  The way you play the game influences the world and how it changes!

And now for those of you "nay-sayers" who think you can only play this game a limited number of times.  Says Who!?!  The rule book.  Once you've finished season 1 you can still play the game!  Play it however you like; traditional, with Legacy rules, etc.  I'm sure there's a way to add the traditional pandemic expansions as well.

And now for tearing up cards and altering, or as some of you would put it, "damaging" the game board.  If you really don't want to rip up cards just put them in the bottom of the game box.  I did that with my Risk Legacy game and it's just fine.  Once again I managed to overpower the rule book and realize that I could play by the rules and keep all the components to my game.  And as for putting stickers on the board and writing on game pieces, that's half the fun!  You're customizing your game so that it is unlike any other copy.  You can enjoy the twists and turns of your game and then see how things could have been different on your friends copy of the game!

Now, off the rant wagon.  This game absolutely deserves to be number one.  It's a solid game that gives you repercussions and rewards for your actions.  It immerses you in the game play.  You'll remember playing your game sessions for years to come.  Yes, sometimes bad things will happen to you in the game but the world is not all rainbows and butterflies.

This is a solid 10!

Wasn't sure if I wanted to get standard Pandemic first, but having been given this as a gift I'm glad I got this first. So far we've just played the non-Legacy rules to teach the game to Rachel, but having the option to switch to Legacy rules next time is great.

UPDATE: Started the Legacy rules and we played 5 games in a row. Amazing.

I haven't finished it yet, but the narrative of the game is great. Despite its one-off nature as a legacy game, I think it's a pretty good bang for your buck. I could imagine that it could be frustrating if you get hosed too many times but otherwise it's great.

Like the original, this can cause heart attacks, but with the addition of the Legacy system, you get a new game each time you play.

We finished the season with ONE card left. Yes, one. All we had to do was get safely to my turn and that was it. All Epidemic cards were already revealed and the only thing that would stop us would be an outbreak. Everything was suspenseful enough, but victory was ours.

I plan on getting our board framed.

Excellent! I don't care for Pandemic on it's own but this is a different animal. Played 6 games so far and can't wait to play more! 

Edit: finished finally and though good it still suffers the same problems inherited with Pandemic, like if you shuffle wrong your done no matter what - which happened to us 3 times during the campaign, 1 being the last game (first move, epidemic, 3 cascading outbreaks with faded) not cool. Will I play season 2 absolutely, did I have fun? Of course. It's just more tempered now. Rerated to a 7.5

This game fits my game group really well. There is a lot of anticipation for each week and what new and interesting things will happen. We talk through all the options as a group and decide what we think will be best. Pandemic is a fantastic game and having lasting implications allows us to continue a story every week.

That being said like base Pandemic however this game doesn't need more than one person to play it. This leads to some players dominating the decision making and their decisions effecting the game more than others.

RATING: 7
NO SPOILERS, don't worry.

2015-10-31 - 9 - After the very first game it's a 9. It's awesome and I can see that it is only the beggining of a great adventure. I have never felt before so responsible for my decisions like I did in this game.

2015-12-05 - After 4 games it's holding really strong!

2016-05-21 - 9->7 - We finished the campaign. This game had many great moments, but it suffers from some issues, which the biggest one is constant changes in rules, which are not precise enough or ephasized enough. Of course we could read the rulebook from the beggining to the end every time the rules were changed, but it's not a fun thing to do in the middle of the game.
The story was OK, but it was not as thrilling as the legends said. We were a little disappointed by the finale as well.
I enjoyed the game but I'm not sure if I would like to play it again knowing what I already know, even if the story would be erased from my mind.
After all I prefer regular Pandemic with two expansions.
I am really glad that I finished such a hyped game, but I know I will not jump on the second season right away as well as on other Legacy games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A lot of fun.  One criticism is the final scoring doesn't reflect game play very well.  However, it ended up being well worth the money.  Loved all the options.  The game started a bit slow with the plot but reved up towards the end.  The last few months were super intense.  Hard to remember all the rules though as they changed game play and often it would be a week or more between games.  I think 2 players makes Pandemic much easier though.  A lot more who is going to do what.

Pandemic with consequences!  Cool improvement to the original game.  :-)  I always liked the original game, but this ramps up the fun!  :-D

A minor knock to my rating because of the infamous, unclear "box 6 or 7" card, which was misinterpreted by our group because of poor wording and definitely should have been clarified.  Great game, despite that.

Very fun game.  If you like Pandemic you will really love this game.  The only draw back is to really enjoy the game you need a dedicated group to play each "month" in the game.  I would probably play the scenario again after I complete it as I enjoy Pandemic. However I could see how the game could lose some its enjoyment factor after you know the story.

I do not enjoy Pandemic. However, I never thought Pandemic Legacy would have me saying, "Let's play again!" I have never played a game like this. Incredible theme that completely immerses you.

RATING: 8.75
You won't play anything else like this game. That is at least until everyone copies it, but this is the original and it is an amazing game. The tense, dynamic and ever-changing situation makes it feel about as real as any boardgame ever will.

03/02/16 update: I have lowered my rating slightly due to some disappointment over how the last two months of the game played. It felt a bit anticlimactic after logging so many plays and so many hours with the game. Still a great game, but I enjoyed the middle months (April-October) the most.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
(Spoilers)Positives:
-Story is good for first three quarters
-Unexpected plot twists and turns
-Interesting mechanics, characters introduced
-Legacy elements keep game fresh, though become somewhat predictable later on based on shape of the cutout, etc.

Negatives
-Still pandemic at its core (meaning easy to have alpha players, mechanisms of the original game almost always present)
-Some bonuses are almost useless, or are underpowered compared to others.
-Story kind of tapers off at the end, would have liked more writing, kind of anticlimactic.
-Many rules discrepancies and broken combos which are legal. Needed to refer online for last several games. This stuff should be addressed in rulebook.
-Seems to be typos/wrong information in places, this may be fixed in newer printings. Was confusing at times.


Would recommend if you enjoy pandemic and have a good group without alphas!

Played 19 games of it in a 3-day span. The story was compelling, obviously. Only complaint was the anti-climactic final game, which was just a brief mop-up of the penultimate game, which we narrowly lost. If the designers had figured a way to keep things tense all the way to the end, it'd have earned a 10 from me.

I fully admit it crumbles my cookies to see something as bad as this shoot up the ranking.

"Defies description as a game" is very apt. Games have common-knowledge rules by definition.

Setting aside categorical issues, the story is laughably bad and the gameplay consists of unimaginative variations on pandemic. The level of game design effort is comparable to dreaming up a dozen chess variants without worrying about balance. It's made to be disposable — hardly an endearing trait, though not the root of my dislike.

I've explained and defended my remarks extensively in the forums and now I'm quite done with this shitty "game."

On the bright side, this game has helped me be more economical with my time. Whenever I have been tempted to make a post on BGG, thinking to myself "the primary audience for this will be people who like Pandemic Legacy" has caused me to do otherwise.

It's also a good litmus test for opinions. That this travesty won 4 categories of the Golden Geek Awards shows them to be absolutely farcical.

You need the right group to play this. Players that are not going to control people's actions while it's another player's turn. A passive player could feel like their not contributing and feel stuck in a campaign that can go on for weeks/months. And then that person may never come back to play.  I suggest making a rule, something that should apply to all co-ops that if it's not your turn let that specific player do what they want to do unless they ask for advice. The game itself is a very intuitive concept and I'm interested to see what they do for Season 2. I knock this down a couple points because I cringe at the idea of throwing away a game, and I wonder how many people have bought more copies because of mistakes or losing non-committed players and wanting to start over.

I'm not too into coop games, but pandemic was a bit of an exception.   Because my son and his fiancee liked regular pandemic so much we decided to try Legacy.  For me it's the same gaming experience as regular pandemic, but with a different game set up each time.  It's fun, but we played February and March wrong due to the confusing rules about end-game conditions.  It is a bit fiddley and we have to review all the special cards & stickers before every game to refamilarize ourselfs with the "new" rules.  We're into June in the game (writing this in Jan 2017, started playing in November 2016) and my son is ready to take a break and play some other games when we get together.  I've gotten probably 20 plays of regular Pandemic the last 10 with "on the Brink" and honestly I would be just as happy to have had that experience and forgo Legacy.  Both are good for coop and entry games.

Pandemic is an already great game and the Legacy version expands on it greatly. One of the worries I had was as the game changes, and trust me it changes, that it would become slightly unbalanced. However, there are multiple systems in place that I will  not go over in this review that keep the game difficulty balanced. That is not to say it ever gets easy. The best part about Pandemic is that one wrong move and things can get out of control really quick. As far as the Legacy aspects of the game go, you have 8 secret boxes and many hidden dossiers that will change the game as you progress. These are welcome additions to the game and they do a good job of pacing them out as you go so you are never overwhelmed. For newcomers to Pandemic, I would play  few rounds of the base game, which you can do with the Legacy board, before starting. I highly recommend this game to anyone that enjoys strategic and tactical play with a good story and unique Legacy system.

The reason for this ranking is that I will never go back and play it again. It was very enjoyable to play, but I have no desire to go through season 1 again; I want to try season 2 though. This type of game is kind of hard to rank based on the ranking system.

Raised rating to 10 after finishing the entire campaign for the first time.

A boardgaming experience unlike any other. A complete masterpiece. Never have I been so completely invested in a boardgame.

The second time through was, of course, less engrossing. I recommend playing through this campaign quickly, rather than spreading it over the course of an entire year.

RATING: 7.1
Some cool aspects to this game, but definitely not the best game of all time.  The legacy component is misleading -- the results of the game don't truly adapt to your decisions, you might get a slightly different experience on their narrative.  And it's still Pandemic -- far too much luck of the draw.

In a normal Pandemic session it does not hurt if the high amount of randomness destroys a game - you just reset and try again. The sessions are very short. But in this epic version every lost session carries over and has hard consequences for all the rest of the campaign. So if the huge random factors kill your session and result in a lot cities already in uprise, you have invested a lot of money in a game that will never make fun and that just plays you and not the other way round. Other than the normal Pandemic which is great here the randomness can kill a whole campaign. A pity.

(Random factor means: drawing always the same cities close to each other, so outbreaks kill the session without any chance for the group; the player cards always divide among the players without any chance to get a set; the needed action cards always coming at the end of the game; the first epidemic cards coming right in the first player turn AND resulting instantly in an outbreak...)

Our campaign has been totally ruined by starting with simple bad draw luck and having the first three months always exactly drawn the same color we cannot treat with right at the start of the game session...

Ah, and by the way: Why always the same f****** thematic background? It becomes anoying that even here you stumble upon... . Really, the designers had no other ideas than Captain Obvious?

I'm not sure, 5 games in and although there is tension and excitement, the knowledge that the game appears to proceed despite the outcome reduces the immersive qualities of the legacy concept. Still a long way to go and my impressions may change.

Amazing experience. We've only played January at this point (will update this) but the Legacy system is incredibly compelling. Pandemic was already a great game and Legacy catapults it to the top of the heap.

That being said, I expect this to cool once other competitors start to introduce better Legacy-style games (Gloomhaven, newer Daviau projects) and the hype subsides but for now (Dec 2015), Pandemic: Legacy seems to be the game to beat.

Advent calendars in games are just too much fun.

(Nov 2016 update) Finished one campaign and into September in another. Definitely better the first time with the surprises. Different groups make for very different experiences. Still amazing.

RATING: 1
would like to try but have doubts. 
I have problem with pandemic and a problem with legacy.

The idea of a changing board is nice, but it assumes you have the time to play this, say, once a week. If you take it up after a month or so the tension is gone. 
Thematically, curing viruses in time wins you in Pandemic. Then more viruses come, and you must cure them. And again ad nauseam. Until the board is ruined.
Look if there was a way to capture the "story" that unfolded last time, I'd go for it in an instant, like "Last time in your favorite series happened this:" ...; 

You would play this with good friends only, and when you are young. You can't play with people you meet at most frequent once a month; you can't play it with acquaintances. You might start it up with your loved one, but how will you react when your loved one tells you half way (s)he's no longer interested, or just plays along in the impression that you want him/her to.

Ranking through May. I never loved Pandemic very much as it always felt a little impossible and too aggravating. However, introducing a storyline into the game made me look forward to every session my group does. Love that the boxes/stickers/secrets ramped up so heavily from Risk Legacy. It really feels like an evolving world and story.

After finishing December, I felt it was a bit anticlimactic. The twists and turns in the second half of the year are spectacular. It has a huge game changer that I loved. Just felt the ending was a little lackluster.

Bring on Season 2. May make it a 2 player experience with my GF.

This really breathes life into pandemic, There is a bit of an issue with remembering new rules.

I enjoyed the game in the moment.  I binged on it for 3 days, staying up much too late just playing and playing.  It was amazing.  However, after I took two steps back and looked at it objectively, I can see that it did little more than spoon-feed me some of the Pandemic expansion modules a game at a time.  Opening doors was interesting, but the fact that 99% of the doors were guaranteed opens, and that most of them were opened in waves, it made the "Legacy" experience feel a bit scripted.  I wish I had had more influence on the outcome of the story, rather than simply trying to do the best within the confines of a predestined outcome.   I also wish the game had resulted in some sort of stable-state unique Pandemic board and that it had more surprises.

All together, it was a great experience that I am glad I went through, but I am not sure how well it is as a game.

The first few plays were really, really good--[i]so[/i] good that I was [i]mad[/i] that this game, unnecessarily built to be disposable, was so much fun.  Later plays... "ehh," and by the end, we were just playing to finish it, not so much because we were still having fun.

During play, we didn't destroy components; we made & used proxies, so that we could play through the campaign again with different people, and with different strategies... but after all that effort, we don't actually [i]want[/i] to play again; hence the rating.

(Also, the end-of-campaign scoring was a little disappointing, like running a race, only to discover at the finish line that victory was determined not by the order you finished, but how high your socks were hiked up.)

Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.

[2016.Feb.19] The game features some new chrome, including new characters, different objectives, and dynamic game state (the board, characters, & game rules change after each play), but all-in-all it's still [i]Pandemic[/i]. If you already like Pandemic, then you will also (most likely) like this offering; if you don't, you won't. (And, if like me you're 'Meh!' with regard to Pandemic, then you'll most likely still feel the same.)

Ugh! I would probably like this better if two things had happened: (1) Matt Leacock should have never released so many similar expansions for the base game. (2) It scaled better. Original Pandemic scales decently - it's not perfect, but those Event Cards do help ease the difficulty somewhat for a 4-or-5-player game (not so much in Original as much as in On the Brink). This game just takes away that huge advantage. It got to the point to where we were losing via the Outbreak track by the 3rd Epidemic. EVERY. SINGLE. GAME. That says to me that they didn't play-test the game enough. And I have always said that Pandemic feels like a game that they play-tested A LOT because so many games go down right to the wire. We rarely saw the wire in the last half of Season 1. The game promised a deeper story and stronger characters, but neither feels any deeper or stronger than in the original game. So, really, the whole thing just comes off as Pandemic: Now with Even More Rules! Pandemic has too many rules already. It certainly didn't need more! Had we played with just 2 characters, like so many others seem to have done, maybe we would have liked it more. With 4 characters, August through November were absolute chores. A game shouldn't be a chore.

Sat down and played four times in a row. The game is primarily still Pandemic that we all know (If you don't enjoy Pandemic, I wouldn't touch this one with a 10 foot pole!). There are obviously legacy effects which do make things different and modify the game board, character abilities, and cards.

At the time of writing this we are in out second game in May, so we are about half way through. I swear every time we play I like this game more. Every month has been a tense battle that seems like there is no hope to win but we somehow manage to at least see the finish line(we are currently at 4 win and 2 loses). I love how the balance changes and how one month I can look at a special ability and wonder why we would ever want it, but the next month wonder why we are playing without it. This game is amazing. Once we finish I plan to update this but I feel like my view of this game can only go higher.

RATING: 7
Definetly not worth the hype and all the no. 1 rankings, though not a bad game at all.
The legacy experience is absolutley worth playing it. But the legacy aspects are also the only reason I kept playing this. I really liked the suspense of all the things to come. The added components and mechanics keep the game fresh enough to go trough the whole year. But still it's always quite the same. No intend to ever play a second copy or classic Pandemic again.

Ein zweites mal würd ich mitspielen, aber nicht aus eigenem Antrieb. Wobei es interessant wäre wie viel Punkte man noch rausholen könnte, wenn man wüsste was da kommt ;)

Last week I played Pandemic Legacy and it was bad. I have played the game with three friends. As often as we could, we agreed to play an evening after work. We have bored 6 nights. Apart from the last night we decided to stop, and decided to grab a few pints at Marrie in the cafe around the corner. The last time we played it started getting boring. A jar takes an average of an hour or two, but there have been times that it went in 1 hour. too bad for an expensive game that you have to destroy and then throw it into the trash. afterwards I get the feeling of money beating, and this is not the way to deal with the earth. come on save the whales.

Pandemic Legacy is an game that keeps you wondering, what's going to happen next?  The game provides a lot of different upgrades, abilities, and story.  What made it fun was either trying to eradicate viruses to get an upgrade, opening up new boxes and mission objectives, or the large amount of characters you can just shuffle around each month at your disposal.  Most friends or people with common interests will not sit and play this game approximately 18 times over until it ends.  However, for those that do, it is more than worth it.  You should be thankful for those friends because they are great people!!  If I were to state some items that I do not agree with, they would be that I don't like the scratch offs.  Even though they are fun and remind me of the times when I would get lottery tickets for Christmas, they make a mess when scratching which can be a pain in the ass.   One upgrade provided called the roadblock is pointless in my opinion.  My friend and I never used them, don't see a use for them, and would find other upgrades or tropes to be more useful instead of using them.  I also found that if the creators are to put in dialogue or story through letters and emails near the end of the game, put them in the beginning as well.  Most of the writing does not serve much of a game playing advantage besides extending the story.   While making this, the creators should have thought went with the idea of either we put it in for the whole game or don't put it in at all.  I would also have to say that game is a bit easy in my opinion.  Maybe I'm wrong but I do like a difficult challenge.  You could say it is well balanced.  However, my friend and I were two people playing 4 characters which makes it harder and we were rolling through 3 months without getting close to losing.  However, I don't hold that point much against the game since the progression keeps it exciting and fresh.  It got a bit harder when getting closer to the end.    What I do like is the large range of characters you get to use and the fact that they are expendable.  The medic you so badly covet can be lost and gone forever if you are not careful.  I also love the subtle upgrades.  Ones such as grenade belt and nuke made me and my friend chuckle when thinking about the application.  Again, Pandemic Legacy is so much fun.  My co-workers roll their eyes because they are tired of hearing me talk about how much fun it is.  I very much look forward to the next season.  From what I've seen and heard, it is going to be a dystopian future which puts it in a place to utilize a lot of post apocalyptic ideas and themes.  That being said, I like the game where it is going.  I hope they continue unless they are repeated and watered down like the hit T.V. shows Smallville or Scrubs that last for 9 or 10 seasons ugh...  In the case that if it does, move on!  One more note, the saddest part of playing Pandemic Legacy is the fact that you just finished the number one rated game from boardgame geek and have to find something else to do that is equally satisfying.  There is only one direction to go which is most likely down.

This is hard to rate. It's technically my favourite game I've ever played.

But, I wouldn't want to play it again. It's one of those weird things that don't fit into the boardgame rating system here.

I wouldn't want to rate it low, as people will think I don't like it. But based on what 8,9 and 10 mean here on BGG, I don't know how much I'd want to replay it now I have finished it.

TLDR: So I won't rate this game due to the above. But it is a 10 in terms of everything except BGG's own statement of 'would always play it'.

Mechanically, it's awesome; my only mechanical complaint is that with end-of-game upgrades, there are too many rules. Stress about the next game between games, though, doesn't make for the best gaming experience, and there's definite stress between games for me on this. On the one hand, that means engagement. On the other, stress, which isn't why I personally play games.

Pandemic Legacy : Season 1 is my first legacy game and I love it so far. New elements introduced throughout the games make this an incredible journey. The immersion in this game engaged our playgroup in a way I've never experienced before with another board game. The brainstorming in the set-up for character/event cards selection, the harsh decisions during game and the choices of permanent bonuses after a game makes it a perpetual puzzle you try to optimize. I'm starting to appreciate Pandemic mechanics more than I thought since Alpha player syndrome doesn't seem to be too much of an issue with this group.

Just finished the campaign with my hubby. Absolutely loved it. Just pushed pandemic to a 10 for me. 

We played at 2 but using 4 characters. We had tokens to mark which player has went to not get too confused. It was a very satisfying experience and tense moments throughout the game. Great story line and wonderful twists. 

Would I play it again? Absolutely! Although I know the twists. I did take down all the stickers and salvage 90% of them. The second play won't be as epic but it'll allow us to play one last time before storing this game away forwever. Wonderful.

Played months to coincide with calendar months in 2017.  An extremely enjoyable experience.  There were lulls where a few months were 'less exciting' in the narrative but overall it was fantastic.  In the end the feelings we had were much more akin with the feeling of finishing a movie than playing a game.  While I know people have replayed it, I know that I am unlikely to be able to enjoy another campaign due to the nature of the game but that's ok.

I don't understand the people who didn't like original Pandemic but loved this one, but to me this is still a great game. Not on my top 10, but I can see how some people think it is unparalleled. 

*POSSIBLY MINOR SPOILERS*

The game starts off initially very much like original Pandemic, but as the game progresses your objectives, your character abilities, and the parts of the map evolves along the way. About a third of the way into the game there is a seemingly quite drastic change to the game. However, the general feel of Pandemic still remains, in that you are scurrying around trying to quell hot spots while still having enough time to fulfill the win condition. To me, the legacy system didn't seem that innovative. Instead, it felt like playing a campaign variant of Pandemic, with a ton of different modules thrown in. In fact, there are a lot of stuff that are nods towards things added in the normal game expansions. The ability to switch characters (and often advisability to do so), lack of uniqueness between specific cities, and few in game events I think made the story weaker than it could have been. However, playing a ton of modules of Pandemic with stuff carrying over from game to game is not necessarily a bad thing. One of my main complaints of base game Pandemic was it felt samey, and this game definitely spiced things up from month to month.

The constant additions to the board does make it cool that no two games are the same, but it also made the board very bloated with different modifiers and I think they could have made things a bit cleaner.

I went 12 & 3 on my campaign (which I binge played in one day), and while a bit disappointed the game wasn't harder, found it enjoyable even in our twelfth hour of game play, so there is something to be said about that.

I really struggled with where to put this, but ultimately the lack of replayability pushed it down, despite loving absolutely every minute of it when we played. Seriously. I think there are very few games that I've played that have been that engaging and tense across so many plays of a game that was mechanically the same as the last (14 total for us).

Pandemic made worse. Much worse.

Starts out fine for the first couple of games, but it quickly changes the game to become more random. I suspect it wasn't really intended for 2 players and it might be slightly better with 4 players.

I also hated the constant changing of the rules, sometimes mid-game.

Ultimately, it's a very dissatisfying legacy experience: Nothing that you do really matters as far as the story goes. Everything that will happen will happen, it's just a matter of whether you take one play or two to finish each month.

It's all the things Pandemic is, but the Legacy edge adds weight to everything you do. There's constant tension.

I also like that losing, while it sucks, makes you just as fulfilled as a win might; though wins in this game are hard-fought, so they're even better.

I'm not saying we should have Legacy everything, but I'm glad they took something other than Risk and ported it into this mechanic. I really hope they do a season 2.

So worth the hype. Amazing experience that takes the original Pandemic game (great game in and of itself) and makes something magical.

The advent-calendar-esque boxes are a blast to open, the story is fun and exciting, the components are great quality, and the Legacy aspect is amazing. You definitely find yourself looking back and wishing you had done something differently to prevent an issue you're dealing with now, and it's great to see the characters grow across games.

Note: The campaign is long (as it should be, since it's only designed to be played through once) so make sure you have a committed group who is willing to meet once a week/month/whatever for a number of weeks/months to finish it out.

Pandemic IMO was already a great game.  Difficult, tense, and highly thematic.  Now w/ the legacy formula just took this game to a completely new level.

Absolutely amazing.  You owe it to yourself to experience this.

Halfway through the campaign, this game is (as can be expected from a legacy game), full of surprises. It feels easier than regular pandemic, though, which makes winning feel not as rewarding.

I still immensly appericiate the simplicity/depth ratio of of pandemic's design though. I think this is what makes it shine as a legacy game: introducing or removing elements to/from the game can be done without making things too complex.

 The game includes a campaign with about 12-24 different scenarios and once it's scenarios played they cannot be replayed because the game requires ripping and permanent changes. Considering the price it's a pretty good bang for the buck but replayability may be minimal.

Amazing game. Everything great about "normal" Pandemic is elevated to perfection.

Cannot recommend it enough.

I'm not a fan of Pandemic in the first place, this rating is based on watching the GameNight! video. I have no objection at all to Campaign/Legacy games, it's an interesting concept. However in this case, the designers and/or publisher went too far, by deciding to make the game unplayable once the campaign is done. Instructing players to literally break the game while playing. Components easily could have been provided to avoid permanent modification of the game pieces, such as tokens, counters, notepads, erasable pens and cards (etc) instead of stickers and destroying cards. This game can no longer  be played once "finished" due to permanent  modifications which is absolutely unacceptable. A game should be able to be re-played and/or shared amongst friends. This is the very definition of a broken game.

Good books may be lended to a friend. Good films may be seen again once in a while. Good games should see a table every week! Pandemic Legacy just can´t do it.

The experience of play was intense, different and very fun. It deserves a ten. Very creative. It took me 15 plays to get to December. And yes, I have played more than 15 times a lot of games that I like that much. This one, I cannot play it anymore. It sucks. ok, I knew it beforehand it was going to die. I don´t wish that Legacy versions becomes a standard to boardgame industry, so I´ll give it a seven.

It's good, but not #1-on-BGG good.

Update #1: We just started June, so we're at roughly the halfway point. The way the board becomes permanently modified is cool, as is the ever-expanding rule set, but man am I getting tired of playing against a deck of cards. Dumb randomization makes for a capricious opponent. No matter how well you focus on your objectives and manage the diseases, a bad shuffle can undo everything.

Update #2: We're in August, and I'm so ready to be done.

Update #3: September. I'm really starting to hate this game. It was early in the game, we had things under control, then over two turns things escalated to six outbreaks in difficult territory. We lost two turns after that.

Final update: I've come to despise this game. Unlucky card draws will cost you the game, no matter how well you plan. The final objectives would have been a joke had they not been so insulting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
[Played a full campaign]

For comparison, I rate Pandemic 9 (and On the Brink 8).

The rules changing between games are fine, to force the players to reconsider their strategic approach (and to add variety).
The rules chaning during a game are not fine at all. It randomly hinders you or has no practical effects or sometimes even helps you... based on something you had no idea would have those consequences (so, as random as it can be). I suppose someone may like the "surprise" factor, but I find it the epitome of bad design as far as "strategy" goes.

It is easier than normal Pandemic (and much easier than Pandemic + Brink), so the only challenge is due to the occasional random screwage. Not a good feeling at all.

The narrative is short, banal and fails to add anythin to the experience.

The whole "campaign" idea is the core of any RPG and many videogames (and when you're done, one click on "new game" is enough... you don't have to rebuy it), so I do not get why it is praised so much (it is not common in boardgames because... it is a plainly bad idea for this medium).

It is expensive and "play once" (that single campaign lasts for as few as 12 games)... not exactly why I appreciate boardgames.

Amazing game!  Some of the instructions suffer from a lack of clarity, which is expected in many board games, however the consequences in this game are more significant as you cannot necessarily undo something that was done as a result of a mis-interpretation.  I feel the game instructions, in English at least, could have been better tested and edited.

Anniversary gift for my gf as it's a co-op game+ranked no.1 on BGG at the time. I have to say the 14 runs that we had were one of the best, if not the best, board-game experiences that I had.

Personally I'm not a big "Pandemic" person. I was never that drawn into the theme. Plus, I am not really a co-op person. But this legacy version completely blew my mind. The box-opening, the story-twisting, the event-triggering. Every decision you make will impact future sessions. And every session is so well-balanced that there were so many moments where our lives were dependent on the last few infection cards we drew. Excitements, suspense, and surprises. 10/10 all day.

I like original Pandemic.  This game is like playing Pandemic with a very clever friend adding expansion modules over time to keep the game fresh and interesting for every play.

RATING: 10
This game truly lives up to the hype. You and your teammates play a series of 12-24 games where each of your games has consequences for the next. A bad decision or bad draw can haunt you for the rest of the game but similarly a well-planned upgrade can pay for itself 10 times over. As a cooperative board game it pushes you to your limits in the best way possible: this one doesn't play itself so you and your teammates will often take 5-10 minute pit stops arguing about the best course of action (at least we did!). The objectives can change without notice which keeps the game fresh and exciting.

 The biggest drawback is that the game's only designed for one campaign. This was initially a major turnoff but we got so much use out of it that I have not regrets: our campaign was 16 games and I can't think of any other game I sunk that kind of quality time into during the past 5 years. 

Everything from the high stakes decision-making to the wealth of personalized upgrades came together to make a super polished game. If you can get a dedicated group of 3-4 people together on a regular basis you owe it to yourself to try this one out!

It's a cool idea, and you do get 12 to 24 plays, but it is too punishing if you choose the wrong characters. A bad starting draw a couple plays in a row, can totally screw you over for the entire game. In 50 percent of our plays, the first player drew an epidemic, which gave us multiple outbreaks to start the game. Bad luck was too high a factor for a permanent change to a game. In our first month, we had a city that suffered 4 outbreaks, and we won that game.

Review as of the halfway point (6 "months" in): Takes the standard Pandemic gameplay and slowly layers on complexity. If you're a fan of Pandemic, absolutely worth picking up. If you hate Pandemic, avoid it. If you've never played it, and you have a semi-regular group it's likely worth the experience to pick up Legacy for probably 15-20 games worth of entertainment (note: that's still more plays than most of the games I own).

More entertaining than regular pandemic.  An intense short-term experience, like playing a good video game to the end. I suspect that this style of game is going to be a new fad.

It's not really new or revolutionary, though.. Well, except that it combines an advent calendar with a campaign-style game.  At its core, it's the same mechanism that drives RPGs and other campaign games.  But, it does have a couple of big reveals in certain months that change major assumptions.  The earlier games remind me of the training scenarios that some games have, where rules are introduced to you gradually from one game to the next.  Overall, it is well-done, the bling aspect is great, and it is quite fun.

Finished in 17 plays.  If you peel the stickers off after you're done, you can use it as a base game set that is compatible with the non-Legacy expansions.

Update: We will not be finishing our campaign. Long story short we got a character early on who was not supposed to be there, and we didn't get the right one. I know there are little numbers that tell you the correct sequence but in the excitement of opening new components who really reads those? Our game state collapsed into a hopeless situation, based on what I hear from other groups the missing character made a big impact on their games. Very disappointing. Z-man was willing to replace the missing card but it's way too late for that to save this game.

This is a great update on the original. Im playing it with someone who has never played pandemic, so the first game was a complete learn. 

Takes a while to understand the cards and stickers and what to do with them, but once its sorted its smooth sailing.

This game is pandemic with a story line (ish). I would give it a 10 if this game did have more of a story/adventure to it. 

Go buy it.

Tales of Arabian nights meets pandemic would be awesome though.

This is one of the best games I've ever played. Incredibly intense and unbelievably fun. Almost ruins regular Pandemic. Not for the weak-hearted. Playing with the same group of 4 people from the start is essential. Having completed it (and getting a quite decent ending score), I don't think that the game wouldn't quite work as well on a second play-through IMHO. but it's certainly worth the $70 (split 4 ways) for that one time.

Ok, so my friend and I just finished playing the game all the way through. We finished with a final score of 861, playing a total of 14 games. I will say that I am incredibly impressed with the storyline that they came up with, but I'm going to lower my score a little bit. The ending was a little anti-climatic, but that's probably due to how well we were doing previously.

One of the best games I've ever played. The idea of "legacy" games is brilliant. While I loved the normal Pandemic this one was amazing. I've played it twice, from begining to the end. And I wait impatiently for season 2.

Absolutely my favorite board game.  Played through with a group of 3 over the course of a month.  Every time we opened a new package or completed a task was a thrill.  Just when we thought we were getting a handle on things the game throws a new curveball.  Even though there's no replay value at all it's entirely worth the money given the hours of entertainment it gave the 3 of us. Highly recommend.

Wow. That was the greatest board game adventure and story of all time. An exhilerating play. Masterfully crafted. Beautifully told. It has all the tension of a great Neflix show and narrative elements that just draw you in. After playing it, I feel like after a great movie or book or TV show, just sitting and feeling overwhelmed by this incredible experience. Absolutely worth every penny, even if we cannot play it again.

RATING: 10
The Legacy aspect of it is awesome! Each game there's a new twist, new strategy that needs to be thought out and everything you do affects future gameplay! While original Pandemic got us into modern boardgaming back in 2007, this just brought a whole new fresh perspective. It will be sad when the year is done and there's no more 'surprises' to open each game, but I'm sure we'll still try to play it since it adds a whole bunch of new things to vanilla Pandemic. It may be hype that everyone is rating this game a 10 as it just came out, but it really deserves to be in the highest ranks given its innovative nature. The components are top notch and everything just work well together from the legacy deck to the boxes/tabs that need to be opened as you progress. The downside is when opening some of the tabs, they may rip or detach incorrectly so its a bit messy keeping track of all the new content introduced, but beside that we are really enjoying the gameplay so far (just finished June, lost a game in April and June when we tried playing with more than 2)

[There are NO SPOILERS in my comment]

My wife and I are playing this one together, with one character apiece (at least to start with, but probably for the whole run), and what a treat that is! I hesitated before rating this a 9 after our first play: I almost went with a 10 right out the gate, which I've only done once to date (for Hive Pocket).

Pandemic Legacy features everything I like about vanilla Pandemic -- the tension, the dash of good and bad luck that can make or break a game, the thrill of racing against the many loss conditions to win, the joy of cooperating against a challenging game (when there's no alpha player, of course), and solid and engaging gameplay -- but it adds delicious, and utterly delightful, legacy elements.

The "kid in a candy store" feeling from Risk Legacy (which I also loved) is present here, and maybe even more refined. Naming characters is a beautiful thing; it's charmingly evil because it grounds them, makes you want to play them again, and starts them on a more personal journey as you play. I love it.

Using the legacy deck to pace the year and reveal new goodies is a fantastic approach, and I can't wait to see what future months bring. I cooled on vanilla Pandemic after 10+ plays (it currently sits at a 7), but "Pandemic that changes every game" has my full attention.

Dont own but played through friends copy.

My rating is possibly a little harsh as actually really enjoyed playing it. 
Dont want to spoil the story but was disapointed by the ending. The final scoring involved elements hinted at in the story but were independent from the indivdual goals of each scenario.
If at the start was hinted, pay attention to the story and overarcing plot not just individual goals would have fared significantly better in final outcome.

The other thing wasnt a problem with my playgroup (at least hope others didnt feal was from me!) and thats 'alpha player' problems.  Would be all to easy for one player who knows pandemic to dominate the group with others feeling like they were only helping them and not really playing themselves.
Bare that in mind when playing and people with dominant personalities try to make sure you are envolving all your group.

The gameplay is more immersive than the original game, and makes for a remarkable play experience. But at the end of the day, it's still Pandemic.  It's very prone to the alpha player syndrome, making other players feel less involved. And the legacy version gets Way more complicated than the original, to a fault. The endgame is very analytical and think-heavy, like trying to solve a puzzle. That's not really a bad quality though, it fits in well with how you play the game. But should be noted with the overall playing experience, as lighter gamers likely won't enjoy that as much.

A singular experience that I doubt will ever be duplicated - because of how unexpected it was, and how seamlessly the story and gameplay melded together. That said, there are more rules in this game than possibly any other game I've played, and I love heavy games. Each game took 10-15 minutes of setup and rules review before playing.

Super enjoyable but not for your baby gamers. 

(Marking as previously owned because whatever you call the pile of torn up cards I own now, it's not Pandemic Legacy anymore.)

RATING: 9
Regular Pandemic was quite fun enough (but would get boring in several sessions, leaving it as a "sometimes" game). But Legacy put it "on steroids": constantly changing map, evolving exciting storyline, new stuff all the time. It has quite simple rules but requires quite a bit of thinking to find an optimal way to solve the problems faced, which can escalate quite quickly. Mostly recommended for groups of 3-4 (best 4), and you should probably buy this game all together - it is a legacy game, board and its components are constantly modified/destroyed, so game loses its sell value completely by the time it is finished. Also duration of 15-20 games average is very decent - occupies quite a lot of time but not too much, making it boring. Duration is just right. Each game takes roughly 1.5hours, since you also need to constantly read new content and make decisions on the go.

Bought at Go! Calendars store after Christmas sale.  50% off of MSRP.

First playthrough with Michelle and Daniel.  Such an amazing game, where every decision really counts.  We often spend as much time discussing character upgrades as actually playing the game.  The tension is unparalleled.

The legacy element means every game is different.  It's exciting to think just how different he board will be a couple months down the road.

The game also has a great "funding" element which helps scale difficulty as you win or lose.

Lack of "replayability" isn't an issue, since approx. 16 games (average played) is plenty for the value.

----

8/7/16.  Finished playthrough with Michelle and Daniel.
Total Score: 457
Total Games: 19
- Had a good streak first half of the year.
- Michelle took a break from gaming, with us having a 4 month hiatus.  On our first game back, we lost the dispatcher and the board exploded with Faded due to our mistakes.
- We forgot to add Faded to the board whenever drawing a yellow player card.
- We forgot we could add equipment stickers to cards when at Research Stations.
- The end was somewhat anticlimactic ("At Long Last, It's Over..."), although there were plenty of games that ended in bare wins or losses. 
- Maintains score due to memorable experience.

I have not played this game. I can however say that it is clearly the best game of all time and there is no way a stupid game from 10 years ago could even come close to the majesty that Pandemic Legacy has achieved.

I have not played Twilight Snuggle but it looks boring and it clearly has bad components and is a boring game.

2nd best game of 2015. I miss the expansions when playing this, but I think there will be more challenging elements as the game goes on. I love Pandemic so this is fun expansion/addition to family, but destroying the game feels wrong as I'm against consumerism. Continuous story is fun in itself of course. For now I'll give it about same rating as Pandemic (close to perfect), despite lack of fun elements from expansions, but I will easily lower it if endgame doesn't deliver.

Update: February game began to fix my problems right away. Ripping up the cards still feels very unnecessary, but sticker and surprise aspect have began to redeem themselves in my eyes. Most importantly an expansion element appeared in emergent and interesting way, which makes me want to keep playing. With only 2 funding from winning first game (in practice 0 as we they were shuffled to bottom..) it also wasn't a cakewalk like January. I guess January is best viewed as tutorial game that's mostly there to ease you in Legacy elements and set the scene. Hopefully rest of the months are as interesting as February and keep adding interesting decisions. I'll update once more when I'm through (more likely) or given up the game. For now it deserves 10..

Possible Spoilers:

Great twist on an already great game. This was the first Legacy game I'd ever played, and honestly, I'm still only half-way through. I started a 3 player campaign over a year ago with my brother and  my roommate, and in a day in a half we covered some good ground, but haven't all been able to get together since then.

I love that as the months progress (in game) there's new challenges, characters, and rules that come into play... I mean, no shit right? It's a Legacy game, after all!

We had so much fun playing this, and I can see why it was #1 for so long, but let me tell you: this game is HARD AS SHIT! Seriously, just when you think your group might be finally getting the hang of things, Pandemic Legacy delivers a fucking haymaker! POW! And you're flat on your ass...

Maybe I should have started a full 4-player campaign.

What can I say? Really excellent game that brought new life to the Pandemic franchise. I liked the Legacy format and the story arc - though I felt that it was a little less immersive as a story (in the same way that Pandemic is a puzzle of a game rather than an immersively thematic one). I'll almost certainly play Season 2 at some point - though I have [gameid=174430] to get through first

An incredible gaming experience. The plot is cliché and nothing to write home about, and there are some really retarded flaws when getting to the end of the campaign (about which I will not talk here, for that would require the giving away of some major spoilers), but don't let that push you away from the amazing game that's inside this box. A lot changes as you progress, and you really feel the changes, right from the first game. Alpha players can be a problem, but the whole puzzle-solving does encourage the team to think as a group and come up with a solution to everything that is going on. Highly recommended, especially if you can get 4 people to play the campaign from the beginning to the end.

Can't believe the number of 0 ratings from people who have never played it. This game was such a fun experience, I can't imagine someone legitimately hating it. I will admit, it was a little bittersweet finishing the game, knowing that you can't continue to play it as the same experience... That is only due to the fact that it was so fun opening up the new items, knowing that the next game will change and the excitement of seeing what's next. The game is finite and changing, which is what made the gameplay so great, but it's literally so good that you don't want it to end, therefore making it a kind of catch-22. 
This game 100% deserves a place in the top 10 games on this site.

RATING: 6.6
Currently at the end of May. The game was very fun for a while, but the difficulty has gone through the roof (or we are just having terrible luck) because our last two games have both been literally unwinnable. In a legacy style game it is a real bummer to get crushed and have no chance whatsoever. It's strange because we've had some games that were mindlessly easy and others that were unwinnable. In regular Pandemic this doesn't really bother me because I can just shrug and play again, but I'm finding it to be a big turnoff here. Update: I think we have been making a couple of mistakes with the rules that have made the game harder, which raises another issue--you can't go back to fix this sort of thing once you've played enough to understand what you are doing...

Pandemic is a favorite so I was already set up to love this.  The changing elements in each game, narrative arc, and evolving objectives really work well here in creating a super compelling reason to just keep playing.  It's also been a ton of fun to play with the same group for each game - time with friends is what this hobby is all about.  This certainly deserves all the praise it's received.

For example, there become places on the map so destitute, that you get this sense of dread just thinking about going there.  And just when/if you think you have a handle on the current game state, the game throws a curveball.  Amazing.

Cons: The biggest con... the game is going to end. And then you're going to have this awkard dilema of if it's ok to just throw the whole game in the garbage. During the game, it can be a pain to evaluate rules on the fly. We made some mistakes, and though none really affected us too terribly, it's not like you get a re-do.

Other: You know that feeling of dread in regular Pandemic as you're drawing off the infection deck and you're anticipating your game escalating before you're ready? I had that feeling in this game on a grander scale. I actually had a point or two where I wasn't sure I wanted to play the next month (game), because I was terrifed of the next twist. That said, I'd have kept playing this game far beyond when the game ended had it let me.

Best Use: Enjoy it like your favorite TV series. Love it, talk about it with those in the know, but understand it's got to end.

Based on playing January, right now very exited over the Legacy system, lets see how it unfolds.

Update:

Played through the whole thing and what an experience, tense, every choice matters and even though how carefully you plan, things come up that changes everything. We ended up at 725 points.

Incredibly well balanced, considering the evolving concept of the game.
We always have deep discussions on what might be the best thing to do. Everyone is enjoying it immensely. Characters have great abilities, the dependencies work so well (especially considering upgrades). Some end game upgrades seem crappy and we are not sure why anyone would choose those. 
Currently in "August", have to check again when finished

Though the narrative was a bit generic and could have been more fleshed out, it was a good vehicle for unfolding gameplay.  Ultimately I loved it for its expanding mechanics, difficult game decisions both short-term and long-term, and unexpected plot twists that kept turning the game up on it head. I forgot to open a packet in May, which screwed us over for a few games. Eventually we realized our mistake but thanks to that we had a significantly gummed up board. Still, I enjoyed the challenge.

"Legacy" mechanic makes for an exciting story, but it's still Pandemic underneath.  Tense, but also very random.  Starts off simple, but becomes clunkier as each game stacks on new rules to remember.  Not all surprises feel fair.  A unique experience.

Having not played the original pandemic, we did the base game twice before starting the campaign. The campaign feels very advent calendar like, and that will be fun. Looking forward to starting January.

Update: Finished January and looked at the scenario for February. While we were opening the packets we were like "What?! That will be awesome. Cool." Very much looking forward to progressing through this game.

Update 2: We have finished May and still loving the advent calendar surprises. We only play it once, sometimes twice a month and I feel that that is a good pace for the game. I can see burning out if this gets played every game night.

Not really appealing for me as I am barely considering picking up the original for occasional plays (with different sets of people). I could also envision that the idea of the game getting easier or harder by itself would not appeal to me.

Update:
The story has taken a turn wherein my wife bought this at Essen 2016. She has now gifted it to me, so that I am responsible for rules, setup etc.
Her being eager to play this, greatly increases my interest.

"The Legacy Card Deck drives the permanent game changes -- These changes keep each game month fresh, proviiding a slightly different puzzle to solve each month.

If players didn't enjoy the group-puzzle-solving concept of the original Pandemic, they may not like Pandemic Legacy. Players are still tasked with finding an optimal way to play the game, and it's up to players to police themselves and not let someone alpha-gamer everybody's turns. "

Much better than vanilla Pandemic. Map changes and - even more so - rule additions alter the gameplay and therefore your possible tactics. I highly recommend you play with equally skilled Pandemic players, otherwise there's a huge alpha gamer problem here because every move is normally a group decision.

It has been an amazing experience so far, and it is hard to stop playing in between the months! I still have to get used to the concept of legacy games in terms of the game being useless after a certain number of plays; but the trade off is an amazing and immersive experience.

10/10. Vanilla Pandemic is a 6 for me. I don't generally like cooperative games. Other legacy games do not have a strong appeal. But this was a great experience. While the story's twists are not all that shocking, they are well executed. That story combines with the characters and other personalized effects to create a lot of emotional investment. Decisions were difficult, sometimes gut-wrenching, the stakes felt high, and we always wanted to play "one more game" and only relented for sleep and other commitments. Highly recommended.

Choose a stable group of four players. The mechanics allow you to switch up, but players will feel like they've only watched half the episodes of a favorite series. Use a good ball-point pen; "permanent" markers wipe right off. Box opening instructions are under the stickers. They are easy to miss; always check under the sticker doors as you open them.

Played 16 games: 11 wins and 5 losses. Score: 749/1000 (Disaster Averted).

I played a second time with three first-timers. I had planned to stay out of some of the bigger decisions, but in practice since it had been nearly two years since my first campaign, I didn't remember things with such clarity that I felt I had to recuse myself. I knew about the major twists coming up but had forgotten some of the fine triggers and felt I could discuss things neutrally anyway.

A second play is not as exciting as the first, unsurprisingly, but was still excellent. One of the key things that makes the legacy aspect work differently than a typical campaign game (such as an rpg or rpg-like) is the repetition-with-changes model. It's not a sandbox and it's not strictly scenario-based. It is raw mechanical changes thematically woven (story-driven) into a solid, repeatable euro game. The result is amazing and I'm still mystified by those this does not resonate with.

Might have been a 10 with a 4 person group and/or more RP dynamic (or after the campaign ends).

Update: I've revised this rating up.  My observation still stands that both of those might have made it even better, but as the campaign wraps up (Currently heading into Dec.) this is easily one of the best gaming experiences I've been part of.

It's also not nearly as tough as it's made out to be and the fact that we've made it to December without a scar either says something to that effect or to our play style.

2nd Update: Finished the campaign without a scar on any character and kicked December's butt.  This was a great game.

Beat down out of the gates.  Having not played a ton of Pandemic, I'm enjoying it so far and looking toward giving it another go. (2015-10-13)

Second time around worked much better.  January in the bag. (2015-10-20)

Third session went swimmingly well.  I'm expecting next time that we'll meet with horrible results. (2015-10-27)

Two turns away from winning.  We ended up boxing ourselves in a bit and had to choose between which thing we thought was less likely to spin the world out of control...we chose incorrectly.  I don't think we made any glaring mistakes though, so that's good. (2015-11-17)

Last time went swimmingly.  Things panned out in a nearly perfect fashion and we finished with no real consequences.  I'm digging how this game auto balances to make sure you can still enjoy it.

This is a pretty awesome game. How could it not be, it is based off of one of the best coop style games Pandemic? We bought this near when it came out and super excitedly played about 2 games a week for the months. Fast-forward 1 year and we are about 7 months through the scenario and playing a game a month. At the two year mark? About to start December and it hasn't made it to the table in months. Remind me, what were the new rules? How many characters are there now? What were we trying to do? Uh.. so much work to play - I'd rather play regular Pandemic. Verdict - Buy this if you can play ~18 plays in less than 2 years. Oh, and one more knock, the best part of this game is opening the advent boxes - not actually playing the game.

Close first (Jan) game! We had a tough set up with lots of black cubes but pulled it off barely. I don't see how we're going to get far though losing will still be fun. The legacy aspect has my friends looking at me twice when I'm encouraging them to write on the game and mess it up. :)

Pandemic is an excellent game, the legacy part is very well done. Interesting story with twists and turns, introducing new mechanics regularly and opening the boxes is very exiting. Component are very nice, felt kind of weird throwing the game away afterwards. I played through it with my girl in 1,5 week on a holiday in France playing one or two games every night. The randomness of the card draw in pandemic can really screw you over badly in some games, but I felt like the game did balance this out quite well. If you are in any way interested in this and you have the group and time to do it then this certainly is a must play!

Wow. What a powerful game.

Pandemic (as can be read above) got sold because I played it too much and it was the same thing over and over. The core mechanics are solid (and super challenging), but it was always the same. Then, along comes Season 1 of Pandemic: Legacy. I never thought much of Risk: Legacy because I abhor Risk. But the idea of a game board which permanently changes with play... AND the story of a secret storyline revealed over time... intrigued the hell out of me.

Richard and I played through the whole thing. We played like trash, with an abysmal final score of 193. Total garbage. A huge challenge of a game. But we still adored it.

We certainly enjoyed this--an excellent gaming experience. However it loses a point for not being tougher for two players--both well-acquainted with Pandemic--with one character each.

We're done with this. A couple sessions flirted with an 8, but overall it felt like a 7 while we were playing. It's definitely a step up from vanilla Pandemic, but once you're done, you're [i]done[/i]. I'd somehow convinced myself that we'd have a cool customized version of Pandemic we could keep playing, but the mechanisms for December literally remove replayability as you try to win the game. As such, I have pretty much zero interest in playing again, but can't deny the good times we had. A 6 it is.

Wow! What an amazing experience! OK, we already loved Pandemic but this is even better. You really get sucked into the game from month one! Every decision counts and we really tried to do our best as much as we could and still it was only in one of the ultimate turns that we could win our first game! Ultimate game experience! Highly recommended! I don't get it when people just hate this game based on the fact that it's a legacy game without even trying it. Especially because this game will probably see more game plays than most of our other games. Imo it has a very good value for your money  just because of the legacy concept, we are going to play this game more than any other game in our collection of similar weight and after the campaign we still have a personalized copy of Pandemic. Update: we finished the campaign after 14 plays, which is less than 3 euro per game play for 4 players. One of the best price/overall experience values you can get!

I have to say WE LOVED IT!!!! 

It really feels like the game is evolving, the story is evolving and we are immersed in it... it's a great great experience improving greatly on the base game of Pandemic... it starts the same but it evolves...

I won't rate it right now, will only do it at the end but man, this looks to be just AWESOME!!! Do yourselves a favor, get a group of 4 friends, buy the game (splitting the cost it's pretty cheap) and enjoy yourselves!!!!

[o] This was one of my top games of the year up until the start of November (in the game), not because it's a fantastic game, after all it's Pandemic but because of the whole evolution and story building, and then it suffered a great blow with Team Bravo and then if suffered a Major critical hit after the penalty in final scoring!!

Really disappointed with this :( gets an huge knock on the rating![/o]

For me the biggest problem is not that it is consumable, but that it is Pandemic.  Over the base game of Pandemic, I'm adding 0.2 points because of the legacy system.  It is enticing even though the story elements here are primitive and cliched. Regardless, I appreciate these baby steps towards richer narrativistic board games.

Read the rules very carefully, since it is easy to miss something.
We played first few games incorrectly and the game was easy and boring.
In the third game we got rules *almost* right and it was much better.
This is decent game.

Best Leacock game so far, but base game was pretty good.  I had more anticipation for getting to the next play than any other game owned.  The constantly changing strategy and group interaction is what makes this the best game for me.  Own two versions, one for campaign with sticker resets and my original with slight sticker modifications to play one of three games focusing on different strategies.  Board can be used for basic Pandemic and looks much better.

Shrink removed now just need to set up regular times to play.  Played first three months - this is an amazing gaming experience.  To be honest the replayability issue is dead in the water this is the best value for money game there is.7th Jan.  Completed the campaign loved the twists and turns.  Can work as simple pandemic but new role cards are useful for this.

NO SPOILERS! Yes, this is a 'consumable' kind of game where you are 'spoiled' of the surprises and the story line when you have played it through. But it does not necessarily mean that this is a 'one-time-only' kind of game. Just because you know what are there waiting for you does not mean you cannot re-experience everything again and enjoy the game the second time around. I know people who are willing to replay it, particularly with others who haven't. I am one of them. Even if, it is solely because of this reason: the experience was that satisfying, that exciting and that electrifying, you want your loved ones, your friends, even strangers to experience it too. You'll be willing to sit through the long plays, even hold yourself back to not tell them the 'secret', to be with them when they discover the twists and the turns that make this game remarkable. That extent of willingness is a mark of a very good game in my book. We know movies, TV series, books that we watch and read many many times and sometimes do that with the uninitiated so we can share their happiness or disbelief when the 'turns' of the story appear. We don't call those movies or books a 'one-time-only', so I won't call this game that either. Come to think of it, isn't this what being a geek all about? We are sometimes the ones in 'the know' and the ones who hold 'the secret' just because we were there first. But it is the source of our deepest joy when that secret was finally found out by others and we are willing to go through the ride again just for that. Not to mention that we simply love the book, the story and in this case, the game. It is every bit the definition of 'outstanding' the way BGG meant it.

My only legacy game so far.
It was a nice experience, and I was really, really looking forward to the legacy mechanics. But somehow it wasn't really that much fun. Almost nobody died and after the game I regret tearing the cards. Because with some extra stickers I would played it again.
The story was nice and the upcoming rules were often great stuff.
Sadly we sometimes lost a month very closly and the second run was only half exciting.

There is no way around it: this is one insanely addicting game. Did it deserve its number 1 status? Maybe not, because it IS a one shot plus the base game is "just" Pandemic (which I've grown a bit tired of; it basically becomes a push your luck game when you learn the basics & has very few reasonable decisions), after all. BUT this is still 12-24 plays a box, which is more plays than 90% of games I've played get anyway.  

The Legacy system works incredibly well and improves the basic game in every way. The added mechanics and rules are thematically and mechanically sound. The Legacy system also just makes you want to play more, immediately. To get more stuff, to open more boxes. It's like crack. The flavour and suspension it adds to the game is truly unique, as of yet. 

Still, I hope Season 2 alters the base mechanics somewhat, because I've had enough of Pandemic per se.

It's bascially Pandemic with gradually introduced expansions. Game experience greatly depends on the people you play it with. A bit overrated on BGG because most of the time players will look forward to their next playing session (and the new things that come with it) and then after it's done, it's just done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
I know that this doesn't fit the mold of how BGG ratings are supposed to go... this rating is mostly meant to reflect the basic fact that this game offered something I've never experienced in a board game before, and I'd happily run through another campaign of it. It wasn't perfect, but it was incredible, for me.

This is probably the only game on here that I'm breaking the rules of the ranking system for. As a legacy experience I shouldn't even rate it as a 6 because that implies I would play it again, which i will never, ever do. It's way too much a commitment from a gaming standpoint for the pay off you get out of it. Legacy is way better than pedestrian Pandemic, but I still don't want to play it 18 times. The new stuff was really cool at times, but sometimes the games were just dragging on, or the chrome was too tacked on. Over stayed it's welcome. It had some high highs, and some low lows. I am glad I played it, but will never play a big legacy game like this again. I could have played 18 other games, and I wish I had done that.

While I am ethically opposed to disposable games (I offset my damage of playing this game by making a donation to an environmental charity), I can't deny that this game is hella fun. The main reason I don't rate this higher is because 10 means "I always want to play this game and suspect it will never change." With Pandemic Legacy, I would only want to play through the campaign so many times, so... not 10.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Overall a great game with lots of fun plot twists. The pacing could've been a bit better - some of the middle months were kind of slow with not much new introduced, and then a whole ton of stuff happened in December that would've been better spread out more. Our group wasn't able to adjust to all the changes well enough to figure out how to win in only two tries.

WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILERS IN THIS COMMENT!

I'm starting to come around on this game. Only a month in, and I'm already chomping at the bit to play it more. I don't even care for Pandemic that much, but to see all the permanent changes happen is something I really enjoy.
---
4 games in, January and February. I'm finding out just how poor of a Pandemic player I am, but a very cakewalk-like 4th game had me avoiding the 8th door in the box. I thought about throwing the game, but didn't want to mess with the system. This game is tough, but in a good way. I'm really liking how this game is developing. One complaint so far, however, is that the instructions on the cards don't really differentiate between opening boxes and peeling off things in the files. Seems like kind of an odd oversight. Still, this game is up to a 9 for me. We'll see how I feel when it's all said and done, but for now, I'm really enjoying the ride. Not to mention 2 of my characters are 1 scar away from dying!
---
Well, the Faded have shown up, with Taipei being City Zero. They have already spread from Beijing down to Sydney after a single game. I also ended up getting my first win without having to repeat a month in March. Ended up switching out the Dispatcher for the Operations Expert to join my Scientist, Researcher (Both still with 2 scars each), and Medic. So far all my losses have been due to outbreaks. Still don't see the usefulness of military bases.
---
Finished the game with 7 wins and 9 losses for a score of 706. Soldier, General, Medic, and Immunization Expert all ended up dying before the end. Quarantine Expert ended up being the traitor, which sucked because she was my favorite/most useful character. I loved this experience though, and would enjoy going back through with my wife. Favorite month was probably either April for the Faded Figures or November for the Immunizations coming into effect.

---

Playing through a second time, and I have to admit that the events aren't as interesting this time around. I'd rate the game a 7 on a second playthrough.

This game will win all sorts of prices.

I do like Pandemic a lot.
But this is something else. And it's even something else in comparison with other "Legacy type" games.
Flawless. Tight. Cleverly designed. Excitement and a true feeling a cooperation. Wonderful storytelling campaign superbly built into the the game.
A TRUE hit for coop lovers like myself.

We had played a few games when we decided to try out PL. This immediately lowered the other games we had played during the day to a mediocre level. It kept us up til 4 am the other day.

Well done Matt and the rest of you. I envy you!

EDIT: After 7 games played (2 losses) it's still a 10, but the greatness of the games makes my demands rise even higher. Therefor, I feel it's a bit repetitive, the storyline is halting a bit since the game basically "resets" every month, plus the fact that it suffers quite a lot from the Dominant player syndrome. The latter could start annoying me too much actually.

EDIT: Finished the campaign. 17 games. Fantastic experience even though our last months became ridiculously easy, leaving a bit of bitter anticlimactic after-taste. Nevertheless looking forward to season 2! Oh please make it good!

Very nice Pandemic experience. Being a Pandemic fan for so long, I couldn't skip it. 

The only reason I don't give a 10 to this one, as I did for the vanilla version, is because I think the game could have been even better. 

If destroying your game worries you, don't rip any cards while you play and you will be able to replay it easily afterwards. My reset kit consists in 12 paper sheets, a box of 100 cheap card sleeves and 4 coloured small circle stickers. About 5€ for the whole thing.

Does not really bring something new to the game.
The fuss about all secret windows and compartments is lost after a few months. What's the point to have to scratch the cards for the bonus, when from march I could guess every single one of them ?

We've played through september and this was our 6th loss in a row. We realized too late how important roadblocks were, and with a bit of bad luck the game snowballed against us.
We are going to finish this game, but we are definately in the mood of "Getting this over with" instead of enjoying it.
You may say we are bad players and made bad decisions, but the game should be able to guide us back to a state where it is managable again. This is however not the case. Asia is gone and so are parts of north+south America.
I consider this bad game design and not the fault of the players. We are barely able to set up the game for the coming months before the game destroys us. Getting 3 complete turns is neigh impossible.

I'm getting more and more convinced of NOT getting season 2.

I had a hard time with rating this game.  It took 17 games to complete the game, and only now do I feel qualified to rate it.

It is one of the few games that we speak about specific moments from.  This may not be the best game ever, or even my favorite game mechanically speaking, but it has provided the best moments of gaming in my house.

To the normal Pandemic game is added a layer of rules and add ons for a campaign legacy game. The game itself is quite tense, but throw in a campaign and it becomes even harder. 

What makes the game shine is that you are problem solving as a team as new obstacles and surprises come up in the game. The story is really enjoyable and quite clever leading to a high enjoyment factor. It's quite thematic in the situations you are put in, and what your characters have to do.

The legacy aspect of this game is really well done and add a lot to the base Pandemic experience. One underrated aspect is that you now have a reason to try to accomplish as much as you can (building research stations and eradicating diseases) when some lucky draws present a relatively easy win making those games more interesting.

Pandemic Legacy contains everything that made the original Pandemic such a fantastic board game, repackaged into a campaign format that creates a deep sense of investment in the results of each passing play, and wrapped in a thrilling yarn of global politics and medical R&D. The resulting experience continuously shifts just enough that the individual rounds of the game never grow stale, while simultaneously conveying an overarching sense of epic scale and grand storytelling.

RATING: 7
After playing it five times, I disagree with both 10s and 1s out there. It is a great experience, but, just like Pandemic, not a very interesting game. The actions are repetitive and there are not many strategies here, even including the powers. But, then, this was my problem with Pandemic in the first place. I'd still play Robinson Crusoe any day of the week over it.

The fact that you can't play it more than 24 times (which is more than most people play most games anyway...) is not a problem, though. It feels like a video game or a movie experience, and I don't play or watch them more than once ever. It's a great experience (and I use this word again), so enjoy it while it last and that's it. As a game, it's a 6. As an experience, a 8. So I make it an 7 and I'm happy with it.

One more thing. Ok, I also don't think this is the best game ever. I have my own Top10 and this is not there. Giving 1s just because you disagree with people's choice is, however, a very stupid thing to do. Have you played it? Do you really think the game is that bad? If not, you're just an idiot trying to convince other people of your truth (like a fanatic, get it?). And, please, do not say it's not a game because it only lasts one playthrough.

Edit: I maintain my score, but I have to admit that I'm having a tough time finishing it. After a while, the surprise effect is gone and only Pandemic is left. Overall, a fun experience, but there are too many better games out there.

Like other legacy games, I am struggling with exactly which members of our group should play this. We can't get our "whole" group together as often as getting part of the group. And it seems that you really need the same group to play the whole thing all the time.  We will probably end up playing with just two or three of us.

SPOILER ALERT! This game comment contains spoilers. Do not read if you want to avoid them at all cost.
I waited to write a comment until the game was finished so I could include my full experience. Quick disclaimer: I played the entire campaign with Zeynep as two players. We had a blast! The beginning was incredibly fun and engaging as the game changed substantially every single month, with military forces coming into play, C0dA continuing to evolve, and new characters joining in the struggle. Around the middle of the game, we started to feel that the game was getting a bit repetitive, since the only thing that changed was the search card. With the medication coming in, things got exciting again and we ended the game on a high note. We both found the overall experience to be highly enjoyable and are looking forward to the next season.

Even after the campaign ended, we keep playing regular Pandemic by simply ignoring the stickers. The regular plays are also logged under this game.

RATING: 9
By February, I knew why everyone raved about PL:S1.  It's Pandemic in hyper-expansion mode -- January was a unique experience, February was a unique experience, but they built upon each other so well...

As much as I'm enjoying the experience, I hope the Legacy fad remains that.  I don't want every game I experience to be a 12-night adventure, never to be played with virgin eyes again.  I want most games to provide me with all the experience I'll ever need in the base, with occasional expansions to add variety once the main game has been well-loved.  Because that why this Legacy game works -- not because of the 'cool mechanics' but because it rips open the long-term nostalgia for the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Thematic, strategic, and ever-changing. Pandemic Legacy is an extremely fun and memorable gaming experience. Yes, we only got ~15 plays out of it, but that's more than enough to warrant the price tag and the memories we'll have. 

Deserves its current BGG top spot. I recommend this board game to everyone who even slightly enjoys games and has any possibility of a regular group.

The game started off pretty strong reaching what I would consider its peak in April. Then, in my opinion, it kept that steam up until September, at which point I honestly found the game rather exhausting and repetitive to be fun. Furthermore it shares some of the original game's problems: promotion of quarterbacking and severe variance on turn.


However, the raw emotional moments that I've shared during the firsy half of the campaign make the game's rating to not come off as a surprise to me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This game really improves Pandemic for me. Since you're playing many games in succession, losing one doesn't seem like such a failure, especially since the game sets you up for failure and multiple points. The changing nature of the board requires you to change your focus, so the game is never quite the same with each subsequent play. If you can get a group of people together to commit to this, I recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Much has been already said about Pandemic Legacy, so I'm going to be concise (and spoiler free). I like Pandemic and wanting to try the legacy experience, this was an instabuy for me. It took me little to no time to find players with enough interest to endure all the campaign, but our weekly meetings had to get cancelled sometimes, and we didn't finish until March.

The legacy experience creates a thematic environment that suits Pandemic like a glove. It was sorely needed. Now, for example, you will think twice (or thrice) before risking an outbreak, even if the chances for it to happen are low. My usual Pandemic game length doubled while we pondered all these decisions. Everything became much more intense, every success and every failure.

As for the story, I found it compelling enough, but I have to say that sometimes it's not immersive enough and you can see the actual reason for something is not a story need, but a game mechanism. My main issue though, is the final scoring system. I don't think it's totally fair, it detracts from the immersive experience and leaves you with a slight "bad aftermath feeling".

I have played 17 games and I'm not one of these rare few that will repeat the campaign, but I enjoyed every one of them very much.

Updated 10/21. 
When all is said and done it's still just Pandemic and still the most overrated game on BGG. God there are so many hundreds of better games out there. Make that thousands. I rated the original Pandemic a 5. This gets a 2 for being a throwaway version of Pandemic. Sure, there are all sorts of little gimmicks included but that's all they really are, still Pandemic. And yes, you can play the game again but only in the state that it finished in your first game. So really no replay-ability to this and I think the game could have been produced in such a way as to make it replayable instead of having you destroy or permanently change the game.

I DIDN'T like Pandemic. I thought it was ok but didn't want to play it anymore after my second play. Yet I LOVED P:L and would gladly do a 3rd campaign if someone offered it.

A bit of a shame more effort wasn't put into the writing, but it was reaaally good.

PS : if you find it too easy or are already good at Pandemic, add a 6 Infection card into your deck (or reshuffle the frst one into a 6th deck.) The game as is is really easy.

Ancora in fase di sviluppo il mio giudizio perché il gioco non è un granché, ci troviamo di fronte a Pandemic, un cooperativo che a me non ha mai entusiasmato per monotonie e ripetitività di azioni e strategie. Il Legacy invece è un sistema di gioco molto interessante, divertente, coinvolgente e sono curioso di provarlo su altri prodotti. Il mix è un gioco che si lascia giocare, spinge a continuare la campagna e comunque coinvolge, da provare assolutamente.

I wanted to wait rating this, but I seriously can't imagine the rating to get any worse (currently played successfully until the end of May). 

I am already a huge fan of the orignial Pandemic and it's one of my favorite games even without the Legacy part, which is btw also not gonna change after having played this one, because Pandemic simply is the classic boardgame you can play over and over again and I like this as well. 

But this one is simply a very exciting, interesting and superfun experience. Yes the game is "over" after a certain number of plays and your copy might not be played anymore, but the experience on the way totally makes up for that. There is the constat tension in the games , because every outbreak, every wrong and every good decision you make matters and at least to me the fact that you only ever gonna have "one shot" at it and it's not "just" a campaign, simply makes this a very unique and interesting experience that at least to me is worth the money I spend on it. 

I know some people might feel different about it and I can understand that, but I personally loved and still love the experience and while it's not something I now want to see for every game out there, I'm totally up for a legacy game experience once in a while.

I really wasn't sure about this as a continuing game.  Gaming buddy got the Blue Version and it is fantastic.  The stress level is ramped up to incredible levels as you want to win with the least amount of damage to the board setting.  Decisions and their consequences in game 1 or 2 could come back to haunt you in later games.  

You get 24 plays so not really an issue with the limited plays.  Though you have to play with the same group (or same level of experience).

If you have a dedicated large group to play it with this is a fantastic game, but as a 2 player game (how I play it exclusively) it is somewhat lackluster and after 4 plays I haven't even opened the box in months. The parts it adds are minor, and add very lightly to the game, and it felt like it was just more "stuff" rather than adding depth to the game. Still a 7-10 because I know how fun it would be with 4, but as a 2 player game I'd rate it more like a 5.5/10

Secret Santa gave me this game for Christmas 2017. Thank you, Santa!:)
We don't really like coop games, and don't like vanilla Pandemic, but decided to give it a go and finished it yesterday (14 games all in all). 
We enjoyed it a lot! Most importantly, my wife asked to play it almost every day, which is not something that happens often. 
Is it perfect? No, there are too many tiny rules that you need to remember and it's quite hard if you miss a few days between the plays, as the rules snowball. We had to consult the manual multiple times throughout the campaign and still managed to screw up a few things here and there. The storyline also sort of loses its momentum towards the end, in my opinion and overall is merely ok, nothing spectacular, reminiscent of a Syfy produced movie. My wife did not appreciate the fact that you need to replay the same game if you lose (we lost twice), saying that a few more changes apart from adding 2 bonus cards would be more interesting. 
Having said that, I really recommend this... experience. There is something cool about the way the game unfolds in front of your eyes and you get a bit invested emotionally. Winning feels good. Losing makes you want to try harder next time. There are quite a few interesting decisions that you need to make, before, during and after a game.

Part way through this and loving it.  Regular Pandemic is a solid game.  For me, this Legacy version just ramps up the experience.  In all honesty, with these legacy games I'm never quite sure wether it's the game itself I'm enjoying or the expectation/surprise factor of the reveals but whatever the case, I'm really enjoying this.  If you like vanilla Pandemic you have to try this out.

I gave this to my daughter to play with.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]A year later and the shine completely wore off of Pandemic Legacy. It happened not too long after jotting down my original thoughts on the game. Two things happened that soured me on the experience. 

The first I seem to be at complete odds with most gamers because I thought the story took a nose dive once freaking zombies were introduced. Really?! Let's take one of the most overused themes in gaming, and pop culture, and make that the story twist. Then, wait for it, there is a traitor in your midst. Yup, didn't see that one coming a mile away. I'm honestly shocked that such a rote, predictable and uninspired story line was meet with such glowing praise. This is the game touted as a masterpiece of story telling in game design, no thanks!

Second, keeping track of the ever changing rule set (yes I understand it's a legacy game) became more of a nuisance than something to look forward to because I didn't find many of the rules changes to be that fun or exciting. Granted, I've come to realize legacy game aren't for me so this second gripe has more to do with my discovering that than any fault of the game. However; I still can't get over how bad the story was![/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating, after playing through March, (8):[/COLOR] 

[i]So far we are loving Pandemic Legacy and this is coming from a family that doesn't really care for Pandemic, or most co-ops for that matter (Robinson Crusoe and the 2 Forbidden games being the others). I think a co-op game really shines using the legacy model, I am enjoying it much more than Risk Legacy. The best part of the game are the roles we are developing for all the different characters and how they interact with one another; it's really the story makes this game.

As of now I'd rate it a 10 and it would be my game of the month, but I am reserving judgement until we play through the whole game we are 3 for 5 and about to play through April).

Update 3/22/16

My thoughts and my interim rating have dropped quite a bit. The story and legacy aspect everyone raves about is so obvious and overdone that I've lost most of my desire to even finish the campaign.[/i]

While I am not usually impressed by pure cooperative games, in this game the authors managed to balance it real well, so that the tension increases, and the finale is always emotional. Legacy introduces a whole new dimension to the game, with choices and events in a session having big consequences in the following  ones... Also the character evolution is well designed.

The campaign arc is very interesting with some plot twists, and it is a pity that the ending disappoints. In fact all your effort does not have an impact in the end-game...

Ok. It is a great game. I think that I always want to play it. This is in August 2016 after 4 games winning January and February in the first and March in the second game.

RATING: 8.75
Cult of the New! Pandemic is a great game and one I consider to be one of the best. I rate it a 10. I believe what this Legacy system promised fell short for me. PL essentially is Pandemic with what feels like some expansion content added in from month to month of game play. My wife and I played the campaign through in 3 days and completed it in 17 games. 

At first we were very very torn as to whether we would go full legacy style or not. We decided to go the replaceable sticker route and to be truly honest after just 2 or 3 games in to the campaign we were absolutely glad we did!!! I for one would have been pissed off if I had gone the legacy route. I am very happy to be able to pull this game out again for us and begin again with another virus being the deadly one and watching a fresh new game develop in different ways. 

For me, I feel like what I expected from this game was not what I got. There were no huge surprises, everything was fairly predictable. What I mean by that is, I expected multiple routes to victory type game play. I expected if you opened one of the boxes or ripped open one of the cardboard flaps, there would be something breathtaking that would change the game dramatically. But every surprise was nothing more than the feeling I get when I add an expansion to an otherwise great game. A sort of...ok...that's cool feeling. I also, did not like when a certain card would be revealed and it would list about 5 or more flaps to open...all at once. I kept thinking, did we really earn opening that much new content for the next step of the campaign? The whole cardboard flap system really wasn't a very smoothly organized system to begin with anyway. A lot of times you open one up only to find a definition of what you just discovered from a previous flap. 

My feeling is there are a lot of new gamers out there that had not tried Pandemic before and experienced Pandemic through PL for the first time and are in awe of what really is the base game Pandemic. For the rest of us that know Pandemic really well, this game feels exactly the same with several expansions slowly added through campaign play.

I think Viticulture and the Tuscany expansion did it best. They could have gone with calling it Viticulture Legacy, but I think they did it right when they decided to have Tuscany add new game elements through an expansion adding system. One where each game you win, the winner chooses the next game expansion to add to the next game of Viticulture. This, for us, created the same kind of intensity and excitement that I had from PL. And I have a gorgeous deluxe edition box with metal coins and many expansions that include wooden meeples of varying sorts...a real joy to bring to the table every time. PL could have achieved the same thing with a chit system instead of a sticker system (wooden or cardboard). Bottom line...this game at it's core is a game that is replayable. One that you shouldn't have to purchase more than once unless you want to give it as a gift because it's just that good.

Update:
After resetting the game and packing it away. We have returned to PL for a new campaign. I think playing it again after only 5 months have passed didn't work well and it is affecting some of my choices. I remember too much of what will happen. If I waited over 1 year I believe I would have forgotten most of the surprises. We played a 2 player campaign the first time. This time we are playing a 4player campaign. I would like to clarify, the difficulty is the same I think. Some people commented that the game was much harder to win with more people playing...I disagree. But if you are playing with 4 different and inexperienced Pandemic players...then yes the game is way more difficult to win. 

My opinion is unchanged. I still believe this is an example of "Cult of the New."
We were excited to get it back out and play again, however it feels a lot like a "1 and done" game. The sad thing is pulling this game out and playing it fresh again didn't allow the game to develop in a fresh new way. The game is scripted to take you in one direction...the same direction it did before.

RATING: 9
Let me add another selective bias rating I guess, where people who like Pandemic will play and like it, and those who don't play won't rate it. I'm in the former camp. It gets the same rating and same comment from me as for the base game, as it really is much the same experience, only you take a bit more time and care with the decisions because there are ongoing ramifications that carry into future games (eg if you let a city suffer an outbreak, or you eradicate a colour). Which makes for more interesting and longer discussions throughout (and after) the game, and that's a positive over the base game. It's the same collective race against time kind of thing though, doing the best you can with the cards you're dealt. But there are some nice strategic and tactical decisions along the way.

RATING: 9.5
Thematically, it captures everything about Pandemic that made it fun to play, and added an overarching story that made you really think about every decision. We found that not only were we planning on what to do about surviving the current month, we wanted to make future months easier as well and made sure we did a bit extra on the last turns to increase our chances of winning later. 

We tried predicting the Legacy deck, but there were definitely some twists that entirely caught us off guard. There were definitely some epic victories where we won on literally the last possible player turn and move, as well as losses were we had a 50% chance to draw the ONE card we needed and failed. There are definitely multiple strategies to complete each month, and roles we thought were useless at the beginning (*cough* Generalist) became mainstays near the end of the game once we gave her enough upgrades.

All in all, our first legacy-style game was an amazing experience and with Season 2 coming in August, we'll definitely be getting that just to see how they'll modify and dare I say, improve upon their success.

A Disposable (aka "Legacy") game. Play through it, and throw it away. It's not like Sherlock Holmes, where after you have played the cases, you can't replay them, because at least with SHCD you can sell or give the game to someone else. And if you buy a disposable game and don't like it after a couple plays, you can't trade or sell it. 

I hope this fad doesn't become popular.

Whether this gets a ten or not depends on how the season is resolved and wheter there will be new game-changing surprises between Sept and december.
The game is great and definitly not just a gimmick, but throughly thematic and great mechanism-wise. After 15 hours in two days, I still dont have enough of it.  
Update: After consideration and further games I decided to giver an 8. Its not really possible to continue to play after finishing all month and bad luck can hose you not only i the current game but also in the next. The story is still great, the execution is good, but after 18 games i  a short time span I sort of sobered up a tiny bit.
But everyone should try the first three month at least. It is something special

The base game of Pandemic already gets a 10 from me so I was predisposed to like Legacy but wow, this game is amazing. The narrative is like nothing I have experienced in a game before. Plus, the fact that changes are permanent and affect future plays really make decisions agonizingly tense for me. Great experience.

[b]Rating History[/b]
• Original Rating: 10 on Nov 18, 2015 after 6 plays (through June)
• Downgraded to a 7 after playing all the way through (15 plays). This game actually turned Kristy off of Pandemic. She started to resent playing through the final months. It was all of the extra rules that did it to her. The story was neat at the beginning and really drove us forward but eventually, it just got to be too much. I enjoyed it but I don't have any desire to play through it again. I am mildly curious about Season 2 but I'll need to find a different group to play through it which will prove difficult.

RATING: 10
This game can't really be described. I went in knowing absolutely nothing about the game, and I was floored. I did not expect it to be THIS GOOD. My fiance and I played up to April and lost. Even just playing that short amount of time, this is the singular best gaming experience I have ever had. It is absolutely the best game I have ever played. I will update after we have finished, but I don't expect it to go lower than a 10. We have a second set we will be playing with 4 people, and I will update my feelings after that play is finished as well.

UPDATE: We are now on October and the game continues to surprise me. The only one thing I would say negatively is that there are many opportunities to mess up the rules because there's just a lot to take in. I would caution new players to really read the rules and have to rulebook open during your plays. I looked up many rules questions on my phone and well and we still messed up a fair few rules. I would suggest looking up a spoiler free message board post detailing common rules mistakes, and you can look at rules mistakes for each month as you play without spoiling anything for yourself.

UPDATE: We have finished the game. We did an okay job, pretty proud for our first playthrough. We did mess up a fair few rules but it seems like a lot of people did on their first run through. We are going to play it again with 4 people this time and I feel pretty confident that we have mastered the rules so we will have an even better experience next time.

Having enjoyed Pandemic, I initially thought this was the best game I'd ever played.  The first half of the game was amazing, far exceeding my expectations for my first legacy game.  But the excitement of the changes to game play and novelty of opening boxes wore off about 1/2 way through the season and the second half felt like a chore to complete.  The story was good and the ending was satisfying, but it left me wanting vanilla Pandemic  more than ever.  My biggest issue was the rule changes - it was too hard to keep up with constant changes and there was always some rule I'd forget.  This normally would be forgivable, but in a legacy game it impacts everything that comes after, which is frustrating and I always wonder how things would have turned out if we had remembered to XX in this game, or hadn't forgotten to do YY in that other game.  I have little desire to play Pandemic Legacy: Season 2 unless it can introduce something truly novel and innovative.  I did keep one thing from PL to use as a mini-expansion for my base game, because I have the old version that's not compatible with expansions.  While I do feel this was the best board game experience I've had in my entire life in the ways it bonded us as a group and brought us together as friends sharing this experience together, I'll take vanilla Pandemic over legacy any day.

Enjoying it so far but - I think the rulebook is a little weak. There are loads of exceptions and small rules that are on side cards, sticker sets etc. It would have been great to have better player aids than just the old Pandemic ones. I know they are trying to avoid spoilers but how are we supposed to remember to add scars, make cities unstable etc. etc? Also some of the character abilities need a little more description. 

I strongly recommend that you play a few runs of Vanilla Pandemic first so that the rules are fresh for all players. You will need your mental energy elsewhere! I also recommend that you play it through fairly rapidly. If you come back after a break it can be a little difficult to remember what the hell is going on.

We are at June now and I am losing interest a bit. It is still great but not as mind-blowing as I had hoped. Hopefully that will change when we open the next boxes!!

Yeah - June wasn't amazing. The rules become very complicated too - trying to remember how to handle everything, add stickers etc.

Was getting very sick of this game to be honest but October was pretty good and into November looks like fireworks for the ending!!!!!!!!!!!

Ok just glad to be finished now. Phew. Ok but not worth 22 games and not up to the hype to be honest.

8 plays - I definitely enjoy pandemic, though it's not my favourite. With Legacy, our group got most of the way through and then just lost momentum. As the games continued, the game just added complexity, which just didn't amount to fun or add to the gameplay for us. Ultimately we just got bored, tired of 'rule adding' and quit despite doing relatively well in the campaign! The alternate win conditions were well received by me though.

Season completed and we are all really enjoying it. I was previously a fan of Pandemic but found that it no longer has any replay for me as I've beaten it on all levels and if I play with new people I can't really say anything or I'll basically be playing by myself. We are playing as 4 gamers who play a lot thus there is a lot of discussion with no one leading the game play and the surprises of the legacy version are very interesting. Would I play the same season again, a definite no so the replay even if you buy another copy is limited, but would I play another season, probably.

Having only played this legacy game, I can't compare to the others, but the idea of permanently changing the game board and card availability is fresh to me. While the replayability only goes so far, the experience while you are in the midst of the story you're creating is where this game stands out. The one nitpick is that, since this is a legacy game, it is possible you may have to change the board irrevocably during a session where you get smacked down mercilessly. I do have issues with that.

RATING: 9
Amazing. We had a great time playing it and only very very minor flaws which couldn't change the "10". It was a very unique experience and I think that we will remember our 17 plays for a long time.

I think it lost a little bit of excitement in the later stages which might had to do with us having a very unfortunate losing streak (lots of bad luck involved^^) and I made a big mistake when I forgot to open a door which contained something that might have been interesting for us. But that's entirely my fault^^

Spectacular gameplay. A strong narrative drives the tension through the 12-24 games that this game requires to complete.

This is epic in all senses of the word.

RATING: 7
Pandemic Legacy is a new take on campaign-style games. The game is based on the cooperative game Pandemic, and during each play, players basically play version of that game that may have slightly altered rules or objectives.  As the campaign proceeds, players can enhance their character roles, save certain buildings built on the board for future games, or give cards permanent special abilities.  However, negative things that happen can persist too--outbreaks that happen in cities permanently increase its panic level affecting travel and building in that city, and character roles can take "scars", or negative effects, when bad things happen to them.  The plays are linked together through a narrative arc that's really fun to discover as the campaign proceeds.  This game really did a good job of melding what happened in previous games with the pre-written story to create an interesting game that players feel very invested in.  My main complaint is that the game doesn't scale as well as it ought to--lower player counts will certainly find this to be an easier experience.

A friend of ours started this game earlier in the year. After my husband talked to a few local friends, we gathered enough interest to buy the game. We are now half way through the "year" of the game and oh man is this game ever good. The changing, the uncertainty and the new characters really make it. I think I prefer this version over pandemic itself. This is a great co-operative game. And the fact we are somehow still doing well is amazing. I look forward to this game every week when we get together to play the next "month's" objective. 
I think we will get season 2 when it comes around.

While I have yet to finish the game (gotten about half way through), I will say that I'm unsure of how to rate this. My plays of it left me wanting more, yet once I hit the end of the line, I don't know how I feel about it. Was the ride a 10, hell yeah! Will it still be a 10 when I'm done...? I suppose it'll probably become something that I ultimately cannot rate as it doesn't really express my feelings about the game accurately. 

It's still ultimately Pandemic, just with a really nice and shiny coat of paint.

RATING: N/A
I am an avid Pandemic fan, as I consider it probably the "best", for my tastes, cooperative game in the market, due to its puzzle-like nature. Pandemic Legacy adds a whole new experience, by unveiling surprises along the way. Clearly, from the perspective of just playing the game, it's excellent.

Nevertheless, I reckon that most ratings on BGG are from the point of view "[i]I am not the person who paid for it[/i]", even if many users actually had paid fully or partially for it. For me, when I rate a game, I have to take into account other factors apart from gameplay. Yes, it's so exciting to wait for new surprises and be ready to face the new challenges and the consequences of your actions. However:

(a) The game is not replayable; play it 12-24 times, then throw it away. You can theoretically "reset" it, but it won't be the same.
(b) It's too expensive for what it offers. As of 2016-04-20, it sells for EUR 85.- on amazon.de, while other games offering awesome experience like Mage Knight or Through the Ages are cheaper, even half the price.
(c) This is just a small nuisance for me, but you have to have a solid gaming group, determined to play it. Everyone that starts the game has to stick to the end, as you cannot just bring in new people mid-way during your campaign. I would be extremely put off and annoyed if I had payed 85€ and then have it on the shelve unplayed or, worse, with only one play and an unmotivated group. I can understand that this is just my problem, as I am traveling a lot due to the nature of my work.

All in all, if I was not the person paying for the game, I would had rated it much higher. I would also be unfair if I had rated the game lower, as a great effort has been put into it. Consequently, taking into account all the aforementioned factors, I reckon that Pandemic Legacy is an overhyped game, but with good reason.

Only played one month so far.  Overall it's the same as the base Pandemic game that I love.  It removed the Santiago dead end and additionally replaced the Operations Expert with the Generalist, two decent upgrades.  The Legacy aspect was minor (due to first month), however interesting with making unstable cities, which can focus one's attention more and making diseases uncurable.  I like some of the additions and we'll see how the campaign continues.

Overall I generally have issue with campaign games since I generally won't be playing with the same people.  If you can pull that off, great.

Permanent detrimental changes to the game can (and too often do) occur through bad luck, with no chance for the players to mitigate the risks. These changes can detract from the fun, and are oftentimes frustrating. These elements are usually not a problem in shorter games, but bad luck in the earlier sessions of Pandemic Legacy left a bad taste for future sessions.

The theme is generally good, but the narrative element is not as strong as other reviews had led me to believe.

I enjoyed some of the mechanics added to this game from Pandemic, but ultimately, I would prefer to play regular Pandemic.

Playing through the 12 months of this game was quite an experience. I've always thought vanilla Pandemic to be a good game but not a great one, but it definitely merited and benefited from the Legacy treatment. We played with the same group and with relatively few switches of character. This meant it became virtually an RPG, as we strongly identified with our characters - so much so that I felt obliged to contact Matt Leacock and ask that they preserve at least the option of carrying characters forward in Season 2. Our group did pretty well in the game - only 'failing' our first attempt in two of the 12 months. We also pimped the game by using carefully chosen Lego figures to represent each of the characters.

The elephant in the room is of course the literally destructive aspect of the game. I still cringe at the thought of writing indelibly on the board and shudder at seeing players tear up cards - and we weren't even playing with either of my copies (both of which are still securely in their shrink-wrap).

I've only played the first month. I'll update the rating later. So far, I like this about equal with regular pandemic but I'm excited to see what is to come as we move forward with the game. 

Our first game was tense enough that we were going to win on the first move of the next turn, only to lose it with the infection card we had to resolve first. 

Edited to add: Having played through April, I'm bumping up the rating. Hubby even wanted to play twice in a row to see what the next month would hold... this has been a really fun experience.

Any game my girlfriend asks to play is a win.  The advent calendar aspect is fun, but I still get frustrated with how swingy pandemic can be.  I'm not a huge co-op fan, unless players have hidden information and limited ability to communicate.

RATING: 10
I almost feel like this game was designed for me. Co-op, story-driven, with really fun and challenging twists and turns. I really wanted this to be able to play this again and again and so I dreaded the whole legacy stickers-on-board thing. However, having played it, I don't mind so much. Being able to reset the board would take away from the excitement. 

Find a group and get this game now.

Played only January and it's freakin awesome so far.  I'm fairly confident that January is far from the best month, but if every month was at least as cool as January then I would still be very very satisfied with this purchase.  Now I can see all of the craze for this game. 

In April I believe now and brought this game up to a 8.5.  No spoilers but the game just keeps escalating and getting more and more interesting with cool stuff being added to the game.

Not even half way through but the game has a lot of pleasant surprises. There is a nice narrative to the game which in my opinion brings a game like Pandemic from "dull" to "great". The addition of rules is slowly eased into the game and as a result raises the complexity level of the game to the right notch for me. This is such a unique game and it is worthy of the hype but definitely a one-play only game. I have no interest in replaying another copy once this current campaign has finished as the surprise element will be gone.

7th August 2017
It's now the end of October in Pandemic and I wanna cry. This game certainly does ramp up the difficulty as you progress and it is a welcome addition. Luck still has a lot to play but the underlying narrative in this game is always a breath of fresh air as it throws surprises my way. I feel sorry for my teammate who had two characters die under her watch. Hopefully she got some sleep after the traumatic episode.

We finished. Well played Rob Daviau. We lost. Just one pathetic card draw away from winning. Great narrative and one of the most challenging co-ops I have played. Not too hard and not easy. Season 2 here I come!

First Thoughts: Only played the first month (twice :s), but this was really, really fun. If course this game can only be something for you if you have a group of players whom you will meet on regular basis and who know Pandemic well enough. But if you have such a group, don't hesitate and just play Pandemic Legacy!

Edit 10/01/2016: Final thoughts after completing our journey. A game were you had to destroy components and that you could play only X times. That seemed odd for a 'classic' boardgamer like me. 
Then again I liked Pandemic a lot and I was glad that I could find 2 companions with Wouter and Wim who wanted to make the commitment of playing until the end with me, as that convinced me to get a copy (and even a second English one as the Dutch seemed to have translation errors :s). And I'm very glad I did it as we had a lot of fun exploring this game. You also can't create so much fun without permanently changing your board or destroying things, as it is that that makes it a very dynamic game and makes it stays interesting until the very end. 
So it was 100% worth it's money and I would still recommend it to all who have a group of Pandemic-fans, as for sure you want to play this with the same people the entire trip.

RATING: 9.5
Jumping on the bandwagon.  It is like reading/watching a great series.  I cannot wait until the next game.  Two dings: 1. some of the rules are confusing and easy to mess up (and you cannot look at the FAQ for fear of ruining the story).  Everyone I know who has played it has messed up at least one rule.  2. Finite lifetime.  Definitely worth the money, but eventually the game will be over.

This is the first legacy game I've ever played.  Let it be said that you will certainly miss something in the rules and/or will make the game more or less difficult because of it.  But with that being said, it was without a doubt, one of the most entertaining and most satisfying experiences in my gaming history.  I was adamant about destroying cards and placing stickers but once you put value into perspective it no longer becomes an issue.  We played 14 games in order to finish the overall story which is more than what I can say for a number of other games I currently have on the shelf.  A fantastic ride!

i have to say i like this more than i thought i would.  it is still pandemic, which i am played out of, and they didn't fix the draw a city for the epidemic twice and then the effect which can ruin the game.  however, the legacy mechanics are cool.  lasting effects make the game way more interesting.  i think 15 plays was too many, should be closer to 12.  might play the second season.

I am not particularly fond of co-op games; of the co-op games available, Pandemic was not one of my favorites. However, I enjoyed Risk Legacy and the 'campaign style' game so we decided to give it a chance. 

Though the game play is completely different, this is a very enjoyable experience. 

These campaign style games appear to be a cross between a standard board game and a role playing campaign. A great experience.

Well, if you like Pandemic this should be a no brainer: lots of little tweaks the game-play over the course of (12-24) plays. Yes, the shuffles can be a hugely deciding factor, but that's much like the base game. The storyline was OK, not amazing, but the camaraderie that the game engenders is a bit special. Roll on Season 2!

+Co-op, Legacy mechanic permanently alters game as you play through the campaign.
=Season is a single play through, but will take an average of 18 sessions to complete
-While you can add/subtract players, they will miss out on story/progression. Once you finish the campaign, the game can not be reset.

Update, played through May: We're riding a 5 game win streak, but May stopped us thinking it was too easy. Complaints about the legacy system, not being infinitely replayable, have completely misjudged the concept behind the game.

Do I really think this game is a lowly 2 rating?  Not exactly - the game itself plays fine, it's perfectly good.  So why the crap rating?  Because I know the novelty of this is going to wear off.  Not only that, but this is a board game that costs a significant amount of money (for a board game), and yet which can only be played through one time, since you are permanently altering the game board and physically destroying components.

At the end of the day, this was just Pandemic mixed with a campaign mode.

Faszinierendes Spiel. Das Material ist schlicht gehalten und das Spiel ist simpel zu erlernen. Eigentlich nichts besonderes, allerdings greift der Legacy-Mechanismus in voller Pracht.

Das Spiel entwickelt sich stetig weiter (Spannungsbogen, Schwierigkeit und Regeln) und schafft es tatsächlich, die Schwierigkeit der Spielgruppe individuell anzupassen.

A very well-done campaign version of Pandemic. Pandemic is one of my favorite games, and I still like the core gameplay here. I like how the campaign gives you tradeoffs between meeting your short-term objective and working on some long-term goal. There were several times when something genuinely new and surprising happened, which was fun and makes the campaign memorable. I did occasionally get annoyed at the surprise elements, since one of the things I like about Pandemic is working through the puzzle and finding an optimum path to victory, but you can't do that if new rules appear halfway through a game session. Overall I really enjoyed it and am glad to have played it. The narrative aspect was better than base Pandemic, but the tight gameplay suffers a bit in comparison to base Pandemic.

5 plays in and we're in April. The game has lots to keep itself fresh but more importantly after each game we've been talking and texting about what could have been done better or how we could have changed things. 

I had high expectations going in to this game and thus far it has not disappointed. The only real mark against it is that you should try to play with the same group the whole way.

After completing the campaign I can say that this game has an amazing narrative arc that you just don't find in most board games and every choice has meaning. This was amazingly fun.

Great play through. I found 2 players easy.  I would think if there were 3 or 4 characters it might be tougher. I would definitely buy it again and play with a new group.

Additional:
Played through a second time with a different group.  No problems at all.  Played with 4 players.  As I thought, it is harder to move cards around and generally made the game more difficult.  But, after some thinking, we came up with a good way to move cards around.  I like the game as much with four as I did with two.

A neat experience to be certain, but it's a one-off thing, and I think this sort of game design trends in a direction that hobby gaming isn't supposed to go in.

Fun, for sure, but I think I don't have another legacy game in me.

I LOVE Pandemic. I thought I'd at least really enjoy Pandemic Legacy. Part of the problem may be that we have too many versions of Pandemic, and there wasn't enough fresh material for me. I also wasn't a fan of the theme and story choices Legacy went with. It was intriguing to see how our gameplay changed when our choices became permanent, and the game did generate a fair amount of next-day discussion, but I feel like I can easily come up with one con for every pro (e.g. the sheer amount of garbage we produced while playing). In the end, I wish that I'd gotten two more Pandemic expansions instead, because now I'm left with a game I can't play. I think I just wanted Legacy to be more. I wanted the choices I made to radically alter the direction of my campaign (or at least have that potential), I wanted my story to be drastically different from anyone else's, I wanted to experience mechanics and scenarios I'd never imagined. But Pandemic Legacy really only had one possible story direction, and you were forced to stick to it. In the end, I enjoy playing Pandemic because winning feels like we *have* saved the world and averted catastrophe by curing disease. Pandemic Legacy didn't give me that feeling, even though it easily could have, and that's why I'm so sorely disappointed.

This is a strong contender for a '10'. I am going to wait to see what the replay-ability is like after we've finished the story arc. The game, Pandemic, by itself, has never been that impressive to me. In fact, I had given Pandemic a '6'. The Legacy aspect of the game is what moves it from a '6' to a '9' for me, and has the possibility of ending up as a '10. UPDATE: We finished the game, and while it was a truly memorable experience, it remains a '9' for me.

Not that good. Extremely random (our very first game we lost with 2 players not even having a turn) and punishing, the rules are not clear on many points. 
3 plays in and this already feels very repetitive. The added elements are more frustrating than fun and even though there is tension, it's not the kind of tension I enjoy when playing.

Basically this is too light a game for me and it remains set collection at heart. Plus I play a good but unexciting character.

"Pandemic Legacy" 1st season showed a completely different "Pandemic", full of emotions and lots of unique mechanics, hot plot and unexpected twists. Excellent!

Playing this with two groups, and each party's story is different. Going back to vanilla Pandemic after nearly twenty plays of Legacy felt such a dull experience, until I got complacent and it kicked our asses in south east Asia.

After the initial reticence of destroying components, I am sold on the legacy concept. What stops PL getting a 10 from me is that I can't get it to a table when we have five players.

Edit: We played nearly half way through now and cannot believe how good this game is!

Opened up January and had some bad luck. Everyone at the table is always on edge trying to figure out what the game will through out at the players next. It has a great story arc and players get heavily invested in the game. It is like a combo of: choose your own adventure, a board game, and a sticker book! I expect the rating to rise as more stuff happens during the "year".

GAME OVER

The game had a lot going for it in the first few months. Unfortunately the game quickly lost pace and it became a chore more than an actual fun experience.

I'd recommend the game to people who absolutely love Pandemic. The added Legacy aspect changes up a few things, but the game is essentially Pandemic.

I would've preferred had the game been 4 months shorter.

EDIT: After revisiting ratings this has been dropped to 6. A rating lower than Pandemic. I liked the first third of PL better than vanilla Pandemic, but it very quickly became a chore to get through the story.

Pandemic Legacy is an amazingly intense game.

At first I had reservations about the Legacy concept.  Ripping cards, writing on the board, putting stickers on the board...... I wasn't sure how I felt about that.  I also didn't like the idea I couldn't "start over" and had value concerns.

Due to these concerns, I wasn't planning on buying Pandemic Legacy but my wife liked the idea and convinced me otherwise.  I am extremely happy that she did.  

I am a big regular Pandemic fan, but this turns it up to 11 as Nigel Tufnell would say.  There is so much tension, and the feeling of surprise is astounding.  The game is unpredictable but you feel like early choices could have a big effect in later months.  

The game weaves a story - it's like watching a movie in some respects.  If you enjoyed the base game of Pandemic, I would strongly recommend this game - you will get your money's worth (I've actually bought it twice, it's so good.  One to play with friends, and one to play with family).

I'm finally finished with this game.  Literally and figuratively.  I made a commitment and I wanted to see it through.  To be honest, I was a bit over this game around the time of the June missions.  By September I was starting to dread having to play it.

Was it a fun experience?  I enjoyed playing it with my gaming group.  I didn't particularly enjoy the game.  It was massively over hyped.  It's hard to rate this game based on the BGG ratings.  I will never play it again, and I rated it 4 because it did have enough interesting twists and turns along the way to get me through all 18 plays - but I was hating my life on the last 6 or so games.

We found it overwhelmingly difficult in some games and entirely too easy in others.  It was so swingy for us.  My group doesn't tend to like luck-heavy games and we started getting really down on the game when drawing 2 epidemics in a row (that happened several times).  By the first game in December we just said "ok, let's just play this back to back so we can get this over with."

This is my first experience with a legacy game and I'm not sure I would opt to do it again.  I like campaign based games very much.  I like the theory of things evolving between games.  I'm not sure I like it in practice.

One thing I find particularly difficult, and probably the primary reason I will never play a legacy game again, is that you are pretty much required to play with the same group every time.  If one person doesn't like the game you've pretty much just screwed up the entire experience for the entire time.  That sucks!

I am a fan of Pandemic and Pandemic Legacy really gives you a very unique experience. How you develope your characters and your infrastructure is engaging and leads to a lot of discussions between games. The story and how it represented is fine, but not outstanding.

I am amazed how this game auto-balances, but it can still get quite tricky, if you had some bad luck or made wrong decisions in your previous plays. In the third quarter of the year, the game gets a bit tedious when you try to fight against the "main-character-illness" (come on, this  is no spoiler!). 

The whole campaign format really captivated me and lead me to binch-play this game, which I have not experienced with any other game at all. Certainly one of my top games of all time and I really hope that there will be a season two.

I understand why Alpha players and followers love the game. The Alphas get to run the game and the followers get to "win" on the backs of the Alphas. Why a competitive player would want to play continues to amaze me - or maybe such players do not play it.

I enjoyed the play through of this game. It was fun, added different dynamics and strategies with every new in-game month and was overall enjoyable. I thought the difficultly ramped up a little too much a little too early, so it made winning future games more difficult and we overall lost the game, but it was still a fun play through. I'm interested to see what Season 2 does.

We are into June at the moment, having had a marathon gaming session on saturday 14/11.  
The concept of a legacy game, with a story arch that has permanent decisions is thrilling.  Would a legacy game be so successful if there was no original game that it came from.  I think not.  A game with a new rules system that you learn for one game, that then changes, potentially every next game, would make me wince.
I avoided Risk Legacy for the obvious reason that my wife and I are not huge risk fans.  We both like Pandemic and we both really like this.  Could i recommend this to friends, well only if they played original pandemic and enjoyed it.

17/11 We are now about to start November. Damn this game is good.  We've sworn out loud as events twist our fortunes up and down.  Current standing Won:9 Lost:3.

Finished and instantly bought another copy to play with friends. Love it.

(11/19/2015) - Grabbed this today off of CSI. Kier loves Pandemic, plus I have heard great things about the legacy format.

(12/27/2016) - [8] - With the completion of Season One comes my rating for the game as a whole. Overall I find myself a bit torn with Pandemic Legacy. Prior to the events of September, I would have rated it a 9.5. I was very disappointed with the twist, as I unknowingly predicted very early on what would ultimately happen. Losing the Quarantine Specialist was a huge blow. I felt like the game forced players into that eventuality, even if it gave the appearance of free choice in getting there. The months of September and October were closer to a 5 rating, and really soured me on the game. November and December did recover things, and overall I very much enjoyed playing Season One. I see myself grabbing Season Two when it arrives.

SOLD - (04/10/2017) - With Season One in the books, I'm not sure it is worth the lost shelf space to keep the completed game around for nostalgia only. I took a picture of the final board and scanned our final score and month tracking pages, in case I ever want to look back fondly on the journey.

I loved Risk Legacy, it turned a dull game into an exiting happening. I feel the same about Pandemic Legacy. 

Pandemic Legacy is more linear than Risk Legacy, more or less the same things happen to each party playing the game. Story wise Pandemic Legacy is fantastic. It's like being hooked to a soap. What will happen next month?

Unfortunately, this evening we will (probably) play our last session, but my wife already had me buy a new copy because she wants to play it again.

:) Legacy aspect induces some interesting considerations to take into account (sometimes damage control is better than a shot on winning a single game for example).

:) Over the course of the game, interesting challenges and abilities are unlocked, which makes the basic game mechanics of pandemic much more interesting

:soblue: I would have expected a deeper story to drive the game. Yes, there is a story you play out, but it will never become a bestseller :)

:soblue: Despite new abilities, challenges which add to the game play, I couldn't help but feel that the game got a little repetitive between the 4th and 10th month or so... It is a quite an inventment for me and my game group to play the same game about 17 times, and I would have hoped to get a little more variation out of it. Still the designers did a good job of adding content and finding a good balance between adding abilities and challenges in a way to keep the game pretty tense up until the end.

Absolutely, hands down, without question, the best coop game I've ever played.  Early coop games often times were kind of coop where a single player could ransom the entire group's welfare so that he could win.  That kind of poisoned coop to me for a long time.  Recently, there have been a few titles that were decent.  Damage Report was fun -- using the limited time mechanic.  Magic Maze was fun the first few plays -- using limited communication.  Time Stories... yawn.  With Pandemic Legacy, I look forward to the next play with incredible anticipation, and also with huge dread at the same time.  We haven't finished yet, but I'm already looking forward to Season 2.

Pandemic Legacy takes the Pandemic formula and simply takes it to the next level. It makes every decision count for the entire life time of the game. The suspense that is created during some moments is simply incredible. No other game has made me appreciate a win so much and dread a loss as much as Pandemic Legacy has done. And it constantly gets fresh with new rules and mechanics as the game progresses.

I've played through the whole thing now.

It's Pandemic. What can I say? I'd rather play this than regular Pandemic but - without going into spoilers - there's just not enough in the box. It's less extra material in the box than in Risk Legacy and the story progresses linearly, which makes the game less organic then Risk Legacy - and the story presented in Pandemic Legacy is not anywhere near on the level that warrants this. The only thing that this game has going on Risk Legacy is that Pandemic is a much better game than Risk.

The idea that you replay a month if you lost it is just dumb. In the end, playing Pandemic Legacy becomes a choire, home-work. We become Tools, wanting desperately for the last reveal being something worthwile the whole agonizing 12-24 sessions, instead of just walking away and playing something fun. Much like the Candy Crush experience, I presume.

In the end, Pandemic Legacy reaches first place in the BGG because of the novelty of legacy gaming, as well as the fact that there are things that speak against the game that I cannot speak of because of the implicit rule that I must not spoil anything for the non-knowers. I do love the Legacy part but please, this game is a down-grade from Risk Legacy. When can we see a really good game get the legacy treatment?

This is basically just like playing Pandemic over and over again, while adding in permanent variants between games. 

For all the cool things that legacy adds, there are (for me) at least an equal amount of negatives. While cool on the surface, legacy locks you into playing the same game with the same group over and over. While that is fine with some, it tends to make the game exclusive instead of inclusive, and also makes each box only available for a specific number of people. This limited, throw-away, system is a gimmick that I'm sad to see more games adopting. It's going to make it harder for someone to walk into a game night for the first time and feel welcomed, and eventually hurt the overall hobby.

This game gets the same rating as regular Pandemic with a large asterisk next to it to denote that I will never buy it or any other permanent legacy games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have completed the campaign with 4 total players and I put this game in the solid "recommend" pile. There's not much new ground to break in describing what Pandemic Legacy gets right: an already-solid game gains an added evolving story with associated evolving game mechanics.

There's much good in this game, but I can't give it a perfect score because it's a little rough around the edges. The "reminder" token is hardly used (even in cases where it would be really useful to do so). Various Legacy cards have the same instructions phrased in different ways, adding confusion to no gain. The scoring system at the end of the game is bullhockey, and most of all, Team Bravo can eat a bag of zucchini.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Mostly, it's still Pandemic, which I do not enjoy.  Re-theming one of the infections as SPOILER doesn't really change the game enough.  I like looking at the stuff that was put into the various boxes, but I have little desire to actually play it.

A lot of the legacy elements are programmed, not conditionally unlocked, which makes it feel like the play experience and game history is not actually that unique (which is part of the appeal of a legacy game).  However, since it is a coop, there is more opportunity for players to make legacy choices strategically, which I like -- in contrast to Risk Legacy, where players were expected to self balance the game but the incentive structure wasn't really there.

Rating based on watching people play full games.  It does seem more social than Pandemic, since you can chat about the weird legacy stuff while someone else is taking your turn for you.

Pandemic was nice, but i never played it into the dirt like some people. the Legacy thing is interesting and gives us a reason to schedule repeat plays (or try to) with another couple. i might have been just as happy playing Pandemic Iberia instead, but there's definitely a lot to be said about the narrative thread connecting each of the legacy playthroughs. speaking of legacy, the only regret i have with the stickers and all that is that we took the game too lightly in the early months and now our Asia is hell. otherwise, i've not had any regret at the permanent changes and how that might affect replayability. it's been and will be a fun ride!

Pandemic is one of our most played games of all time, so we were definitely excited about the legacy version of this game.  We played through the whole year and really enjoyed it.  The twists that they add to the game each month definitely increased the excitement and suspense compared to the original game.  The narrative aspect of the game was definitely interesting, but story was not particularly compelling.  Opening up all of the secret compartments was always exciting, but in the end it just seemed like so much stuff to deal with. We spent almost as much time opening compartments and putting stickers all over the place as we did actually playing the game.  I think there was much more stuff in the game than there needed to be.  The rules and conditions were constantly changing for no apparent reason.  Maybe it would have been better if we only played one month at a time, but we played this whole game in 4 sittings, so we ended up opening like 20-30 doors in the dossier each evening, which was just an overwhelming amount of stuff to deal with. We ended up just setting aside most of the extra stuff, because we didn't care about it.  There were too many upgrades, too many rules changes, too many random quests that were easy to complete.  

Overall, this was a fun game, but it seemed a little too contrived and complicated just for the sake of complexity.  It was an interesting experience, and we had fun for those 4 nights that we played it.  But was it worth $60?  Probably not.  We could have had just as much fun playing a game that we already had, and which we will be able to continue playing for years to come.  Some people have plenty of disposable income, and so disposable games may be fine for them.  But we do not have money just to throw around, so buying an expensive game that we are just going to rip up is just not worth it to us.

In the end, we went through and reset our entire game so that we could try to play it again.  Resetting it was actually pretty easy since we ignored most of the rules changes and upgrades that came in the dossier and we refused to rip anything up. But once that was reset was done, we decided to sell it for a deep discount, rather than play it again.

RATING: 8.5
Tentative rating 8.5 after March.  It's cool, it's still basically just Pandemic. It's been easy so far.  The funding level mechanic is an interesting way to try to intrinsically modulate the difficulty - not sure it works so well though.  On one side, I am eager to play more and see what happens, but on the other side, I want to slow down and savor each game. 

Update: Shit got crazy - increased rating to 9.  Story is emerging, interesting - still Pandemic, but with an expanding set of rules and options to have to remember, a little cumbersome at this point.  We had to restart 2nd half of April twice after a few rounds because we had made serious rules mistakes.  It doesn't help to take a month break between plays.

I'm nearly finished with my second campaign... The first one was so much fun. I played it with a couple of my best friends, who don't play board games much, and we were totally engrossed. The fact that the events of each game will carry over to the next causes far more tension than in a typical board game, and since we took the time to name characters and the viruses, and read all the card text, it really made for an entertaining, thematic game.

In my second campaign, my teammates tend to want to rush through the game, and don't bother to create names for anything, nor read the text except for where it says something necessary for game setup. It's still fun, but I found it much more fun the way I played it the first campaign.

Started January 1st, 2016, and played once a month (in real time so-to-speak) over the course of a year with my wife, her brother, and his wife. We'd BBQ and chat, and once their two year old went to bed we'd play. One of the most memorable board gaming experiences of my life.

This game is just absolutely phenomenal. This is my first experience with a Legacy-style game, and it hit for me on all cylinders. I am not yet finished the campaign, but after 12 plays or so, I am more excited to play games of Pandemic, even having played it so much already, than I have ever been to play one specific game. This game is an experience, plain an simple, and a very cool one at that. The theme and the story arch of the Legacy is something that no game can do as well as this one has WITHOUT including the Legacy mechanic. Until Plaid Hat comes out with a Legacy style game that includes Crossroads cards, Pandemic Legacy will remain my favourite game ever, completely usurping my original number 1, Game of Thrones. I can't wait to finish this, and I sincerely hope there IS a season 2 on the horizon. If you are on the fence for this one, don't be. Get it. It's fantastic.

A fun variation on Pandemic. The components were fantastic and the game was interesting. Rating this is hard. The gameplay merits a 7.5 (adding a half point for the components). The Legacy component balances itself out - the options add a point; but the one-time nature of the game drops it a point. 

A fan of Pandemic will love it. Casual fans I could see going either way - some will enjoy it more due to the game changing uniquely where others will shy away from "Pandemic Overload". 

Personally, I am not a fan of the Legacy System; but I do not believe this is simply a money grab. My regular gaming group are big fans of Pandemic - so I invested into the experience and felt I got my money's worth. I expect my interest on any further Legacy products will wax and wane depending on the property it is based on (and likely will be ignored if I am unfamiliar with it). That said, I will probably invest in Pandemic Season 2 when it is released.

Hands down the best experience I've ever had playing a board game. The first couple months play like the base game, and each successive month only gets more fun. The storyline also gives a compelling reason to play through, and I found myself desperately waiting for the next legacy card to see what would happen. If I could give this game an 11/10, I would.

I was a little apprehensive to buy this game, given that it has a defined end (24 games max, only if you lose every game you play; if you win every game, you're looking at 12 games).  I would have to say, however, that this is the best board game I have ever played.  Each change, permanent or otherwise, really adds an incredible depth o the game.  It's well worth the price.

One of my most enjoyable boardgame experience.
The excellent base coop game Pandemic (which is already one of my best of all time game) with an epic journey added to it.

Done the campaign with a group of people that i didn't even know before playing. 
It's the kind of game that has enough appeal to make unrelated people come and play 10-15 times together as a team. I don't know a lot of games that could do that.

Having done the full scenario 1 year ago, i would love doing it again and i'm sure it would be very different.

RATING: 8
A friend bought a copy, and we played the full thing, averaging a game an hour.  There's a decent campaign involved and some fun decisions, but we found some of the stickers could come loose and it was easy to forget a rule or two (sometimes in our favor, sometimes not).  Analysis Paralysis and Alpha Player problems aren't mitigated by the game, but a lot of that is a problem with the group and not the game anyway.  Also, not all characters are equally useful (some feel over powered and others are very situational), which can be an issue as the game progresses.  

Definitely a game to play all the way through, enjoy, and then go do something else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Pandemic Legacy does a lot of things well. The legacy mechanic is a really great way to invest the players into the game experience. There's something exhilarating about marking up the game with things that are unique to your group. There are goofy names to the diseases, departed characters, and memorable gameplay moments all through there. 

But for all of that I am left wanting more. First of all, this is a LOT of sessions of a game I didn't like that much to begin with, although this is a very good version of Pandemic. The overall narrative is also a disappointment. While individual choices make a huge impact within the session, they have almost zero impact on the narrative, which plays out the same no matter what. It might be asking too much for a branching narrative of some kind, but the player did not have a role in crafting the narrative, and that's a shame.

I enjoy Pandemic, once in a while, but for me the whole year scenario is getting long, pandemic is a good game, but even with the interesting rules with the evolutive board, the game does not change that much from game to game, and is still heavily relying on some luck, sometimes you die violently quick, and sometimes you own the game in 20 min.

2nd playthrough w/ fiance
We waited almost a year in between plays to pick it up again, and even though we remember some of the major spoilers and events, this game still surprised us often. The game we played and how we used our characters was different this go around, so the narrative unfolded a lot more differently. However, with insider knowledge and a lower player count (2 + 1 dummy player) made it an easier game with a little bit less tension. Overall great game still and I would never hesitate to recommend it to anyone. 

Modern gaming masterpiece.

I consider vanilla Pandemic a euro, an ok cube pusher (about a 7--my wife rates it an 8), but PL to be a fantastic thematic game that sucks you right in (and spits you out at times). My medic, Jamal Dube, is attempting to save the world with his cranky virologist partner Parker Watson (my wife's scientist character). It's been a wild ride so far! Jamal and Parker will never be the same...

Beautiful experience. Am playing it with my wife right now, and we couldn't have asked for a more delightful reason to get back into gaming together. We REALLY want to play those games! She remarked that she was already considering buying another copy when we're done, with ideas about who she wanted to play this through with for a second time--and she's usually lukewarm about games!

so, a success all around.

This game is so amazing, its like a TV made out of cardboard! The lot twists keep you on your toes and delving deeper and deeper into the story is amazing. (Not a spoiler, just a gameplay mechanic in the rulebook from day 1) my wife is a Scientist and seeing the rule where if you do well your funding gets lowered the next month because the government isn't worried about it anymore and thinks you have it under control was a hysterical "art imitating life". This game just keeps giving and giving, your choices are permanent, which also adds to the tension.

Update: Beat it on January 7th, 2018. Such a great experience! I framed our finished board and hung it on the wall of my office.

One of the best experiences I've had in board gaming.  Experience is a 10, but once you've finished the story, it is not replayable.  Totally worth the money, but as a game, I have to knock it down a point.  Unlike in video games, you can't restart and play again even though you beat it.  When it's done, it's done.  Maybe you can hang the board on your wall?

The only downside to this game is that it essentially kills vanilla Pandemic for me. I don't play the game often enough to even work through the campaign quickly so if I'm going to play in the foreseeable future, I'd rather play Legacy. Still not finished with this one so no spoilers!!!

PL is one of those games that has taken Casa de'Tomas by storm.
We cracked it open the day it arrived, planning to play a single game. 6 games (and 4 months...) later, we had to put it away.

Then we got sucked into a 'game' with a different group (and a different box) at our weekly board game meet-up. 4 games later, the venue was closing, so we had to stop.

Since then, both games have been opened for additional sessions... but never less than 3 games at a stretch.

we're already talking about getting another copy, finding a different group, and playing through it again.

Pandemic Legacy is an amazing board gaming experience with a phenomenal narrative arc, though this is more due to the iterative gameplay changes than to the story itself. The story itself is weak, but the long term consequences of your actions and the organic changes to the board create a sense of continuity that does a better job of generating a sense of narrative than other games I've played with ostensibly better stories. I played it as a 2 player game with 4 characters so that we had a lot to do, and it worked wonderfully.

A great game with seriously flawed end game scoring that left our whole group deflated.  We did not do great but though we did ok with 8 outright wins, 2 wins on the second attempt, and 2 lossed months. Our map was also in decent shape, though we did have a small cluster of fallen cities.  Had we scored just on that, we would have done okay.  But we got dinged because we did poorly in December and did not meet the objectives, got dinged for not completing an optional objective earlier in the game (other objectives were easier for us), and we got dinged big  for missing one optional objective that was part of a multi objective achievement (getting no credit for the parts we did accomplish).  We would have done better had we purposefully lost each month so that we could have more time to complete each objective.

I would give it a five like the original pandemic but a $70 disposable game makes it a solid one.  Plus what gives with the rankings.  Its been on the market for six months and its rated higher than all but three games.  A redone disposable game at that. Hmmm

I've been questioned from a few people about me rating Pandemic Legacy I honestly just don't understand the justification of the game being number one.  I am part of a big gaming community here in SE Michigan and granted it's not THE gaming mecca but its huge.  Gaming is my number one hobby and I enjoy it immensely.  I've played against thousands of different people throughout the years. What I am trying to say is that I think I can give an honest opinion about a game.  
Now about Pandemic Legacy: I've seen it played once and it looked OK.  I asked what the players thought of it and they basically said that it was OK and the game was over-hyped.  All three stores have it in stock and there were Christmas specials for the game,  Up until now I used the BGG ranking system to try games out that I normally wouldn't try out normally.  With the exception of Pandemic Legacy and the Star Wars/Descent game (I didn't care for Descent), I have the other eighteen games, with Netrunner probably being my favorite game. I haven't tried all eighteen yet but its close.  Anyways, the biggest factor of what makes an elite game in my honest opinion is the "fun factor", but since what's fun to me might not be fun to other people it can't be measured accurately.  So I measure games in other more objective ways.  Every game with the exception of Caverna was a completely innovative ideal that sometimes even spawned a new type of game.  Games like Twilight Struggles,which jump started the 21st century war-game, Terra Mystica, Agricola, Through the Ages, Castles of Burgundy ect bring much more to the table than Pandemic Legacy or Pandemic for that matter.  Another factor is what other people want to play.  I've been asked to play Warhammer 40k, Advanced Squad Leader, Panzer Grenadier, Combat Commander, Bolt Action, Magic, Splendor, Five Tribes, Dominion, Marvel Legendary, DC deck builder, Terra Mystica, Caverna, Castles of Burgandy, Castles of Mad King Ludwick,  that fast food Magnate game and countless others over the past month by many different people.  Not one person had Pandemic Legacy nor wanted to play it.  That just doesn't seem right in my opinion.  This game that is just an "improvement" over a game that is seldom played shouldn't even be close to number one let alone number one.  It makes me question the integrity of the BGG rankings and from now on I'm not going to use it to help me decide what to purchase.  Thank you for letting me rant.  I know its a little long but sometimes I enjoy writing.

Its been about six months, still haven't met anyone whose played it.  I cannot give an honest opinion other than the game is so good it never hits the table.  The local store that I frequent has several red and blue boxes for 20% off. Some number one game. 

Well when I write this it is April 15th 2017 and I still haven't seen the game played nor know anyone who played it.  The game sits on the shelf at the store I frequent (both red and blue) I've seen TIME stories played at game stores occasionally and from what I read that is also a legacy game. I've also seen risk legacy and many RPG games played at stores.  Again I just cannot understand how a game that is ranked the best never played.      

Its September 2017 and still haven't seen it played (exception briefly when it rolled out two years ago). I still don't know anyone who has played it.  I just don't understand how it can be the number one game and nobody plays it.  This is an exception of people should only rank games that are played as this is the only game I have ranked and not played.

I didn't think that it would live up to the hype.  I literally, cannot stop playing this.  We don't usually play a game more than once in a day.  We just finished our 3rd game today, and if we didn't have to get up early, we'd have started our 4th.

Incredible variant of the classic co-operative game. Play through one year in trying to save the world. The legacy aspect means that the game changes for each play, and the final game is not the same as the first game. Legacy also means that it has a finite life as a game.

[no spoilers] A truly engaging experience. Takes the solid design of pandemic to a new level with the legacy elements. Decisions are that much more tense and significant. Story is good and brings some interesting atmosphere to these decisions. However, the modification of core mechanisms resulting from the story and player decisions is where the game truly shines! Difficulty was weighted to the easy side, but even so we had some very exciting games that came down to the wire. Would be a 10 if we could continue to play it endlessly.

Only minor negative is that the stickers kept peeling. Would be nice if Z-Man went with a slightly better adhesive in the next release.

Három hónapot látva engem még nem nyűgözött le a Pandemic Legacy. Amennyivel kicsit érdekesebb, mint a sima Pandemic annyit nem ér, hogy a végén nem használható többet a játék. A másik dolog viszont pont ez, hogy egy pár órás munkával simán megoldható, hogy ne kelljen a játékot tönkretenni és újrajátszható legyen, nem csökkentve az élvezeti értékét. Simán újrajátszhatónak érzem a játékot az eddig történtek alapján.

[2016-01-22]
5 hónap befejezve. Továbbra is tartom a korábbiakat. Viszont egyre jobbnak érzem az újrajátszhatóságot. A sok új elem miatt abszolút sokutas a játék, így magának a megóvásnak is lenne értelme.

[2016-02-11]
Na a végére értünk 19 parti után. Nos nekem nem ütött a játék. Volt pár újdonság benne, de számomra már hosszú volt és unalmas. Kicsit több varianciát és új elemet vártam. A szerencse szerepe nagy, a játék nem enged különböző stratégiákat, vezet egy úton, amiről nem enged letérni. Igazából a sok karakterrel lehet variálni csak. Igazából talán csak a december más, mint a többi hónap. A pontozás is nagy részben a decemberi teljesítéstől függ. Úgy gondolom a sima Pandemic az On the Brink kiegészítővel sokkal többet ad és bármikor elővehető.

What a great gaming experience!  The game itself... yeah it's Pandemic.  But I love the innovation!  Bring on Season 2!

Edit:  I put this down to 8.5 due to December.  There are some major rule issues, and a feels a little forced.  I still had a blast, but I still think that TIME STORIES does the story thing... better.

This one seemed like a no-brainer for me. Pandemic is my favorite game so how about a Legacy-style campaign version? It's definitely Pandemic and early on, I was in love. However, as things progress, it becomes a chore of seemingly never-ending stickering and learning more and more rules exceptions, to the point where I am completely removed from the story being told. And while I appreciate the need to continue the story, having to replay months that you've lost is just terrible. I would prefer to just move on to the next month instead of going through the same situation again without any of the tension or excitement. While I think this is still a decent game, it is one of my biggest disappointments ever. I'm out for Season Two.

As soon as we got the original Pandemic and played it once, I knew I had to get this - and wasn't disappointed! It is stressful, gripping, infuriating, fun, and torturous all at once! Knowing the decisions made from the first game effect the rest, and watching the story unfold were two really cool aspects - we played as a group of 3 with an occasionally 4th player dropping in and out over the course of about 3 and a half months, and somewhat took control of our gaming lives for that period - I didn't want to play anything else! The game evolves with new elements organically, and while we had to look some things up on the BGG faq (which is brilliant, kudos to the writers!) and we got a few rules wrong in places, it didn't stop us having probably the most fun and stressful board gaming we have experienced! 

My only complaint is that I hate the wait for Season 2 now!

I trust there will be many more seasons. Great concept, great execution. This game is the epitome of greatness for this hobby: it creates a compelling narrative, beginning with having the players name the characters, establish relationships early in the year, and with the mounting tension and unexpected events as the months go by. The story sticks with you from play to play, and I fully expect to revisit this board and these people even after the Season is completed.

just finished March, so far the Legacy aspect seems little more than an excuse to play yet another session of Pandemic... it's been a good time overall as it certainly makes the game-play a bit more interesting than vanilla Pandemic but it's still basically just Pandemic... it's beginning to border on becoming a slog

RATING: 8
This is an incredible game! The spin off from the original Pandemic was genius! I love that the game can evolve as you play it. I will say that at times this game will kick your butt. When you start off with almost 3 cities on the brink of outbreak on the other side of the world it kinda sucks, but it certainly forces you to work with your friends to cure the diseases. At time there will definitely be a leader in the group, but that is the situation for all of the coop games out there. Overall, great game!

I have lost sleep over this game while playing it....fretting about past and future decisions. I've never lost sleep over a game, ever! This is by far the best game I've ever played, because I got this invested in it. We have quite the experienced game group and although I wouldn't call us jaded, it's hard to surprise us and for us to get worked up by new games. We were highfiving each other after wins and really feeling dejected after losses. We were already fans of Pandemic the base game, especially with some of the expansions and scenario's. Maybe between 30-40 games under our belt. And Legacy blew us away. Things to consider to enjoy Legacy even more:
- get familiar with the base game. At least around 10 games. Even play some games in the digital version (iOS has a great app) to "train" a bit. This will ease your entry into Legacy and enhance your enjoyment
- play the whole Legacy game as much as you can with the same people. It's possible to drop in/out later but it won't be as good for either parties
- read the rules and discuss them among the players before every Legacy session. The rules get complex (although the pacing in learning them is brilliant) and misinterpreting them or missing them altogether will be a detriment to your enjoyment. The game gets too easy or too hard quickly when you miss/misinterpret rules
- Don't ignore new stuff that gets introduced from time to time. Chances are, you will need it, maybe not at that particular moment but for sure in later months. We sometimes got stuck on neutral and tried to follow the same strategy multiple times. We had some success with that but we mostly had to adjust later on and had to play catch-up. 
- Check the brilliant FAQ thread here on the Geek to see if you played correctly and interpreted/used things the right way. 
- Avoid all spoilers at any cost, seriously!

Absolutely wonderful experience! This game combines one of the best cooperative games with a linear thriller storyline and does it amazingly well.

This is an excellent re-implementation of a brilliant game.  The Legacy elements make for a great ride, with unexpected changes every month, and mechanics for balancing the game - whether that's in your favour when you're on a losing streak, or against you, when you're going too well.  That said, it's still 12-24 games of Pandemic, with variations, which does get a little repetitive.  Good thing it's a repetition that I'm more than willing to endure!

Really wish actions weren't so permanent. For Example, if a Character becomes lost you are suppose to rip up the card...I understand that it is a legacy game but I still think you can create a legacy game where the changes aren't so destructive to the game, i.e. magnetic pieces, dry erase markers or even multiple copies of cards.

RATING: 10
My rating was made previous to all the ratings drama that started in December 2015, and is based on a full playthrough of the campaign.

Pandemic Legacy takes a favorite game of mine, and adds an excellent narrative-based campaign on top of it.  The campaign kept me hooked through all twelve months, in many ways like a good TV show does.  It managed to add interesting mechanical and plot twists to the game without bogging down the game in complexity.  

Do I care that at the end of it all I'm left with a game with no replay value?  Not anymore than I care that at the end of a movie in theaters I'm left with a ticket stub or at the end of a meal at a restaurant I'm left with an empty plate.  It's one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had, and well worth the $50 I paid for it.  

Since Rob said he does appreciate more feedback about the game, I will say that while the Legacy deck did provide excellent pacing to the game, I did miss all the packets from Risk Legacy with goals on them.

Actually pretty high praise for me, as I'm not a huge cooperative fan (although I do enjoy playing them from time to time). Pandemic itself is just OK, and I find that introducing it to new players, they often get the exercise that the other players are dictating their moves. Still, the storyline here is awesome, and it's extremely engaging to have your past games affect the ones you're about to play, while at the same time revealing new rules and complexity over time. Love that the roles have morphed into characters so that you build a bit of a relationship with them, and it's awesome how your game-end bonuses are tough choices for how well you want to set up the next game.

UPDATE: Still loving the campaign and getting more engrossed every time I play. Moving up to a 9.

2 plays, 4er

It's Pandemic, which I don't love (it being a co-op), but with a key [i]legacy[/i] ingredient that, so far at least, makes the game much more interesting. 

The initial game is not too different from the original:
- now start with exactly 5 epidemics (I think you chose the difficulty level previously?)
- start the game with only 4 events in deck (chosen as a group during setup)
- character cards are not associated with pawn color; players play a color, and choose any available character
- fewer characters available (I think?) -- there are 5 from which to choose at the start
- panic levels: each time a city has an Outbreak, it's panic level goes up (0 -> 5). At 2+, it's harder to get to/from the city, or build a research station. At 5, the city is destroyed!
- if a character is caught in a city when it Outbreaks, they get a scar; if city falls, they die (permanently)!

Soon, though, you start opening up packets and changing the rules -- great fun!

----
10 plays (4er): we're through June now, and the shine is wearing off a bit. The legacy stuff is really what makes this game interesting, but I expect I won't want to play it again after we make it through to the end.

----
1 game left (late December)! We've seen everything (except the lose-4-in-a-row box) and are about to finish this thing. After that, on the BGG scale my rating would probably be a 4 or 5? I would almost like to try it again, but only because I'd do it with a completely different set of characters -- we played pretty much every game with the Medic and Dispatcher! Now that I've seen the story, though, it seems this is pretty much just Pandemic. Maybe if played with a group of newbies, the discovery aspect would still be fun to watch? Regardless of my dislike of coop games, though, the legacy part of this will likely have me back for Season 2.

*** Spoilers ***

Final score: 576? The last game ended with us running out of cards to draw. It was relatively close: we needed to vaccinate just 2 more cities. The last game was just barely about diseases ... we should have left the medic out of the mix! Again! The scoring parameters were a surprise: the last cards of the deck, revealed after playing the final game. A pleasant surprise, though: it would have been a real letdown losing the last game and having absolutely nothing to show for it! At least we saved the world, marginally well.

I played through an entire Risk Legacy campaign and really enjoyed the Legacy part even though I really dislike Risk.  Pandemic however is a game I'm quite fond of.  Now we put those together and it is really as incredible as getting peanut butter in my chocolate.

For those not familiar the Legacy system is just a term in board games that came about from Risk Legacy.  It is a reasonably novel idea where each game played things happen and that cause permanent changes to the game.  Inside the box are compartments that are opened at specified times.  These do things from make permanent changes to the board and characters to even destroying some components or bringing completely new stuff into the game.

When you start the game it is almost identical to standard Pandemic but before the end of the first game several changes are made to everything from the board, to how the viruses act, to even what your objective is.  And just looking at the amount of stuff still hidden tells me there's even more here than there was in Risk Legacy.  Plus it's a much, much better game.  And they still put in some pretty stellar components as well.

This is a fantastic item if the idea of making permanent markings or even tearing up pieces to one of your games doesn't give you ulcers.  There is also the typical concern that after a campaign there's very little reason to continue playing it.  I have two responses to that.  The first is, at the end, even if you don't unlock anything new, you still have a neat Pandemic variant with its own crazy rules that is pretty unique to you and your group that you can play any time you want just like you would regular Pandemic.  The second is, one campaign is between 12-24 games...and it isn't going to be 12.  Since I got into designer gaming 3-4 years ago there are less than 20 games I've played more than 12 times.  So that's quite a bit of value even if you never play it again at the end of your campaign.

RATING: 4.5
Great concept, but sloppily executed. Throughout each month we slowly got tired, bored, and grumpy with the entire game. Too many rules get added and the story has no real choices. It's completely linear, revealing plot twists whether you succeeded or not. Waste of time as a narrative device.
By December we had to force ourselves to pull the game out and finish it. The whole thing is just stressful, not exciting, and certainly not fun.

So we burned it all up: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn7wwN55-Cs

What a terrible idea. Rating to reflect the unsustainable design of the game. "use once and throw away" is the motto of consumer culture that has permeated into society. Part of the board gaming community that I love is trading games. This game can never be traded by design. Just say no to this garbage.

One of my favorite games. Pandemic is cool enough on its own, but adding the legacy rules turning it into a personalized campaign makes this game ridiculously good. I find myself looking forward to and getting excited to play the next month once I finish a session. The game is balanced very well, it's always a close call whether my team succeeds or not. The board and pieces are high quality and the sense of story and theme is perfectly conveyed. Probably my favorite of all the games I've ever played.

RATING: 10
Definitely, the best legacy game I have seen, it kept our group guessing and was very interesting. My only complaint was that I wish there was a small way to increase difficulty, our group only lost 2 games and 1 was thrown on purpose in order to get some permanent upgrades. I love it overall and really look forward to season 2, but might throw in some extra epidemics to increase the difficulty.

RATING: 10
We're up to April now, and there's now almost nothing this game can do to reduce it from a 10. It would pretty much have to self-destruct seconds before the winning move next month *and* leave scorch marks on the table to get downrated by me.

I like (regular) Pandemic because it's a fun puzzle with simple rules while hitting the right amount of decision-making and luck for me. I don't super-love it compared to other games, though, if only because the app delivers all of this faster plus anytime solo play. 

Pandemic Legacy takes everything I enjoy about the base game and coats it with a few other game elements that I really love: twists that change gameplay without having to learn heaps of new rules, new components to parakeet over, and emotional investment a la RPG without being an actual RPG.

I didn't think I'd be able to destroy/alter components. Now I've joined the crowd wondering which game will get "legacied" next.

UPDATE: Finished the game and standing by the above. The hype doesn't lie.

RATING: 7
An advent calendar style game. Got to March and enjoying the twists so far. However, both D and I feel uncomfortable with the disposable nature of the game - not that it only has x plays in the box, more that it is unusable after x plays (well, it can be used for base Pandemic)

Though after 7 plays the disposable nature of the game is an incentive to play and get value from it. 

9 games in and have lost 2. of the others 1 was to the wire and the rest comfortable wins.Enjoying this but as a 'boxed set' its a must watch the next episode but not necessarily the best drama. Hald way through and I  have a suspicion about where the story is going which  I hope is wrong.

I'm not a huge fan of Pandemic, but I still really enjoyed this. The Legacy mechanics work fantastically, even if they're a little overly-scripted at points.

I enjoy the game immensely, only draw back I’d say is for new players to the pandemic game in general. Like regular Pandemic, the basic game mechanics are difficult to learn and the learning curve is quite steep. Will greatly help the legacy game if all 4 players at very least have lost the regular game a few times.

WARNING MILD SPOILERS

What starts off excellent is sadly let down by a feeling of familiarity and some egregious plot decisions. I don't want to get into any specifics for fear of spoilers, but there is a major event near the end of the game that can cripple your endgame if you forget to do one thing. It is literally possible to have a much worse result if you win the game rather than losing it in order to achieve certain objectives. This left me with a feeling of severe disappointment that honestly made playing the latter half of the game feel worthless. I wrote a thread on it if you want spoilers details. 

MILD SPOILERS OVER

Altogether, Pandemic Legacy is a bit of a mixed bag. It starts out with a lot of promise and you will have a wonderful first few games. Unfortunately, some ugly elements start to rear their heads near the mid-game, with the result that some plays during the middle of the game can feel like a slog. 

Ultimately, I'm not sad that I purchased the game. I do feel like I got my money's worth. Instead, I'm just highly disappointed in my overall feelings after playing the game. There were several times where I felt like I could quit early and be satisfied with my experience, and knowing how it ends, I wish I had done exactly that. A game should never leave you feeling like you shouldn't have wasted your time playing it. If Pandemic Legacy had kept the fun of its initial few plays it would have been a surefire 10, but certain game elements and the ending are enough to knock it down to a 6 in my book and I highly doubt I will play any future seasons in this line.

Incredible. I enjoyed Pandemic and On the Brink, but this is an entirely new level of gaming. I am hooked on the Legacy campaign style, and cannot wait for the coming months of this campaign. Every decision has weight and implications for months down the road, and the significance and risk of that was NOT lost on our group. Fantastic.

RATING: 9
An excellent version of Pandemic. I feel like they could have done a lot more with the legacy mechanism, but I understand a co op game needs to keep a more even keel than a game like Risk in order to keep the game balanced. 

Update: after 17 plays I have finished. October and November were some of the best gaming I've ever had on an emotional level. December was just kind of another month. The game just ends with no special fanfare. I was very disappointed by that.

So far the group I am playing with has only made it to April, but already we can see how things are starting to shape and what areas we need to be concerned about.

This game was so much fun to come back to.  I had to slow my friends down from wanting to play multiple times in a row every night.  I can't wait til season 2.  The only issue I have with it is that I don't really have a desire to pick it up off the shelf after I've finished the main story.

Update about a year after playing: There is basically no replay value in the game anymore, sadly.  I get that that's kind of the point, but it's not even on my game shelf; I'm tempted to throw the box and contents out.

Having passed March my actual opinion is: incredible. 
There have been only a few games in the past, that widened the genre »boardgames« for a new dimension. So did Trivial Persiut in the Eighties (Board Game combined with Quiz?! What for?! ...), Acitivity & Co in the Nineties (Board Game combined with charade?! ...). 

So does pandemic legacy. With this game, I am totally - really - surprised again. In that way, that my thoughts are spinning around this game since days. Pobably too much ideas and new rules; but it's ok so far. Allthough I'm not a friend of coop-games, I love this one! What a great game combined with a great concept of evolutioning.

Rated 9 at first, just for how the story pulls you in. Playing a Two player game using 2 characters each. After completing the game I would still say that it's an 8+ but with kids it took more then a year to play... so some of the intensity was lost. I don't currently think that I would seek out another destructive legacy game, it would be nice to have something useful at the end.(F$)

As per the BGG rating system, "Won't play ever again." In fact I barely want to play it now due to the overwhelming amount of spoilers all over this website. It pisses me off because there are many that are hidden properly but many more exist in regular ol' geeklists, comments on threads, OR AS THE TITLE OF A RULES QUESTION! WTF is wrong with people that do that!?

Update 7/3/16: We've now played January. So far I'm not impressed. Problem is is that it is still just Pandemic. We shall see what February has in store.

Update 12/30/16: We've played through March and it is just more of the same. We hit March back in August and sorta stalled out there. Every time we've gamed since then we've chosen something else. I'm not sure we're going to get back to this one. I know I personally have no desire to pick it up again. There are just so many other games out there.

Excellent experience. The final scoring is best thought of as "epilogue". Don't get wrapped up in that, just enjoy the experience.  It's hard to say if I liked this better or Risk Legacy.

We liked pandemic, love legacy. So had to get this.
Rated it a 10, was thinking about deducting a point for the very bad translations in the dutch version, but decided to ignore those for rating purposes. 
Thinking about it later on, I really can't rate this game a 10, since the urge to play it now (variants) since it's finished is gone. I see us playing regular pandemic more often. So it dropped down to 7.5, but regular pandemic got boosted up, pandemic legacy made us appreciate it more.

I'd be hard-pressed to say whether this game or War of the Ring has provided me with the greatest experiences I've ever had in gaming.  I've been seriously into the board gaming scene since about 2003, and in my opinion, the whole "Legacy" thing is the greatest innovation I've seen in the hobby.  Although the concept failed with both Risk Legacy (you started with a terrible game and very little to do with the actual game play changed over time) and with Seafall (a project that just ended up being too ambitious), Pandemic Legacy showed just what could be achieved with a Legacy system: players became extremely invested in the game, their decisions mattered a lot, and the game itself morphed into a unique world built by the players.  I truly believe this game deserves the #1 ranking here on BGG that it holds as of 2017, and I can only hope that Season 2 captivates me and my gaming group as much as Season 1 did!  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 5/5  Total: 10/10

RATING: 9
I've always enjoyed Pandemic. The legacy much more fun. Every decision has the potential to affect a large number of games. I realize you'll only play it 12 - 18 times, but if you can get 2 or 3 people to play it with you for each of those times, it will definitely be worth it.

The only real downsides are that it can be a little difficult to remember all the new rules that are introduced as you play and that it really is better if you can get the same players in each session. The player aids and rules are good though, and even if you make a few mistakes, you'll have fun doing it.

Once completed, I didn't have any desire to revisit it, but it's still a memorable and enjoyable play experience.

Well, we only got up to May before deciding to call it quits. Too many rules piling up. Too many options. Too many things to remember not to forget. Frankly, it was starting to feel like a chore. My buddy and I are going to spend the next session just opening stuff up to see how the story plays out.

By all means, don't discount all the glowing reviews. This may be something you love. But we just could not take it anymore.

As far as the game being disposable -- as long as you know that going in, what's the problem? Don't buy it or play it if that's a deal breaker. I don't know what all the stupid fuss is about.

Tells a fantastic story that is subtly (and not so subtly) different for each group. The permanent changes give each decision weight and heft and encourages a deep meta game, where you are desperate for certain characters to live, willing to allow certain regions to fall in order to save others and may even consider throwing individual games for the good of the campaign. Keeps everyone totally engaged. A great experience.

I refuse to rate this game by BGGs scales. Basically, I am never going to play this game again because I've finished the campaign. Does that mean it is mediocre or broken? Not at all. It's a great game. My wife and I got well over 12 hours worth of play from this, which I would say is great value for a board game. If I had played all the games in my collection over a dozen times I would be a happy man. In that sense I would say the legacy format was a great encouragement to return to the game over a period of a few months.

Extremely well designed experience. There are a few hiccups here and there, and it loses a point due to that and one rule from Pandemic I've never enjoyed (reveal bottom card to infect 3 during Epidemic and then it could be immediately drawn to cause an Outbreak with no recourse but simply having bad luck).

We scored 772 out of 1000. So I think we did pretty well overall. Wish they gave more indication on a few of the scoring things at the end before hand, but the score isn't really the point of the game.

Highly recommended to everyone who can get a group together to play through the whole game.

I started off hating the "legacy" concept; to me, it is nothing but CRM (cardboard rights management); a way to stop used-sales and make you rebuy the same game multiple times. To me, if the game is any good, I'm going to want to play it again - and not to spend another $50 to do so!

However, I really wanted to try a campaign version of Pandemic, so I decided to go ahead and try this. The first impression is that an awful lot of effort was spent on this "legacy" concept that adds nothing but component complexity to the game.

* Game play on an individual scenario basis was good, with a nice variety of objectives and different situations.
* Campaign elements were weak. Late in the game we had a hard time picking upgrades because there just wasn't anything useful to get.
* Plot elements were awful. There are several that I not only can't stand in a game (or usually even in fiction), but they happen in rapid sequence. Probably the most ticked-off I've ever been at a boardgame.
* Everything bad that happens is permanent and solid. Everything good is abstract and temporary. Even if you win every game, it feels like you are constantly losing. Never once had a feeling of success in the game.
* Feels mostly like passive entertainment. All the important decisions and actions are made by the NPCs. We're just along for the ride and to "watch" the (truly lousy) plot.

The same basic gameplay of Pandemic, only now with legacy elements, so gets the rating from me.  Pandemic just felt way too simple, like it was an easy puzzle to solve.  Sure the gameplay changes some from game to game, but it is still the same boring puzzle you are solving.  I normally love coop, but I enjoy it more with some theme.  This game just feels like it has the theme pasted on afterwords, and that makes solving the puzzle even less fun to me.

I think Pandemic Legacy is a great game. In terms of game mechanics and theme, I think this is close to a 9 or even a perfect 10. If you love Euro boardgames, I in many ways think Pandemic Legacy is a game you should at least try once in your life.

Though that is also my problem with the game. It is a game that I at least, cannot see myself ever playing again. And its not that you destroy the board, but also that I wouldn't be interested in playing with another group. Because what makes PL good are the surprises and curve balls that Legacy add to the mix, and if you know what those surprises are, the game is really not all that more interesting than Pandemic, which is a good game, but not great.

OK, so take a solo game that masquerades as multiplayer and add legacy mechanic.  Now, you can pretend that it's not a solo game 12-24 times before you throw it away.  Yay! (Hive mind game; easy to determine optimal play each and every turn.  No mechanics to give any particular player any reason to play each turn as other than a "group" turn.)  Also, whether or not a game is won or lost is often determined by random effects; how hard or easy any given game is can be based upon factors outside of the control of the players, so to some extent, your decisions can simply not matter.  You make the optimal play and hope randomness swings in your favor.  I have much more of a deterministic preference.

I'm not the biggest fan of co-ops, but if done right, they can be quite enjoyable.  This is another lazy implementation of co-op though just like its predecessor.  I'm victim to the hype machine all too often, and I get caught up in cult of the new probably as much as anyone else, but I just don't get this one.  And I don't hate on legacy systems either.  I'm often satisfied with a $60 game if I can get as few as 2 or 3 good plays out of it, but this game does too little to fix the main things I hate about Pandemic.

I can understand why some may like this game even though I hate it, but certainly there are enough design flaws to make me question how so many could consider this the best game ever created.  Many, many games are much more intricately and intelligently designed.

This game is fun, tense and keeps you immersed the problem is with the rules which are complicated and changing, you need to keep adding more stuff which if you are not aware will break the next game for you, first time you play you might miss something or not play it properly which is a shame since its a Legacy game.

Received in the BGG Secret Santa. Finished within 2 weeks with 2 players.

A unique and memorable experience.  So much of the story is told through gameplay instead of reading. The mechanics of the game do a perfect job of increasing the tension. Every month seems like an impossible task, making each victory more rewarding.

Pandemic is a fun game on it's own, and Legacy: Season 1 lived up to the hype.

It is more the Legacy concept than the execution, although being flawless at the end I felt the path of this particular season was paved with clichés.

I find Daviau's "innovation" far less of a revolution than an elaborate marketing gimmick under the guise of "narrative board gaming."  The intrigue of the system wore off after about three games, and then it just turned into an obligation. I will almost certainly not be purchasing another one. 

The game itself was boring; the narrative derivative and cliche, and ultimately very, very stupid. About 70% of the way through, we just gave up and thumbed through the rest of the Legacy deck to see how the game was going to end. There were so many stupid revelations-- both narratively and gameplay-wise-- that I feel vindicated by the decision.

If I want real narrative board gaming, I'll play something designed by Cole Wehrle or Phil Eklund. They create narrative gaming experiences that put Rob Daviau to shame. And I can play it with rotating groups of players as many times as I want... and I don't have to chuck it in the trash when I'm done with it.

So far two games in, and I am enjoying the game.  I wouldn't call it amazing or anything just yet.  But we'll see I guess.  Maybe it will be more amazing later.

It is compelling playing a game not knowing what is coming but knowing that something is.  You don't get that kind of experience from games very often.

2017-07: We've finally finished the game, and while I enjoyed the experience, it is mostly pandemic, with an overarching storyline.  Although many of the plot elements were interesting, and I enjoyed going through them.  In the end, during the final stretch, the game started to feel samey, and if it were a great game, that would be fine, but like I said, I wouldn't call it amazing.

Pandemic with story and legacy mechanic
The legacy mechanic wouldn't work for me.
And I don't think story-driven board games are good.
very expensive, especially for a single-use legacy game
Another problem is, you need a fixed game group to play through the whole campaign.

It's just "Pandemic" with a bit of decoration!

Tentatively set to a 9, after playing out the first two months in rapid succession. I immediately wanted to play the third game. So...that's a good sign.

I really like that the game changes pretty quickly, giving you the feeling of a living world that you're working to try to save.

Very entertaining.

Update: We've played through August at this point, and the game remains at a 9. We've had only one month which was a double failure.

Update 2: We've finished the game. Total score: 667 out of a possible 1000.  Very enjoyable, and I'd happily play again.

Also, I think it's still possible to use the board again for playing regular Pandemic on when you're done. Playing the last scenario again doesn't make any sense, given the results of playing December.

My rating remains at a 9. I'm considering getting another copy.

An absolutely fun and exciting game. Plays just like Pandemic but with a developing story and an increase in difficulty. Designed perfectly for a close group of friends (3 players is the perfect number). A lot of the time, the team is discussing future actions and the best course of action to take, making it a really fun team building exercise.
Of course, we avoid tearing up our cards.

RATING: 10

I liked standard Pandemic quite a bit. It has always been a game that I enjoy and rated it quite high. Then I read about Pandemic Legacy and I HATED the idea. I hated the idea that a game would require destruction of components and become completely non-re playable. I immediately thought that this was a new conspiracy of game designers to copy protect their creations. I was emotionally dead set against this.

But I kept reading great reviews and comments about how this made a game I really liked even better. So after eating a few meals out with my wife that cost more than the game, I decided I could spend the money for the experience. It took me this type of comparison to get me to consider the disposable game as a experience rather than a possession.

I have read that tearing up a card is a cathartic experience, but even when the game told me too - I couldn't do it. So I missed that part of the experience as I carefully saved every item - hoping that I could somehow make the game non disposable. But in the end, after completing the game, I decided that it was not the thing to do and fulfilled my promise to my wife that I would not keep this game forever. (Did I mention that I do not like to let go of games.)

Even without the emotional catharsis of ripping cards, I loved the experience of the game. It added twist and turns to a game I already liked and kept us wanting to play until the end. It was sort of like combining a game with a good book, you want to see what the next chapter will bring.

After playing, I thought quite a bit about whether or not the designer could have made the experience the same without making the game disposable. I believe the answer is no, not without increasing both the expense and adding mechanisms and setups that would greatly degrade the experience.

I rated it a 10 because of the great experience, and that is in comparison to the other games I also like. Would I play again? Yes, in a heartbeat, but alas my copy is gone. But I would expect that playing again would be more like rereading a good book than the excitement of reading it the first time. If I had a different group to play with, who had not played before, I would be happy to join them as a silent partner to watch them savor the experience.

It was a unique experience because it was a legacy game.  But, it was like playing Pandemic over and over with more and more rules and not an equal amount of fun.  Yes, it was interesting seeing the new twists and turns, but not for as much hype as it's received.  I'm not downgrading it because I'm anti-hype.  I'm giving it an average for the amount of fun it gave me.  Some games were 7s.  Some were 2s.  Some were so boring I feel asleep.  Overall, I wouldn't ever want to play it again -- even if I received a fresh copy.  I don't want to play Season 2.  Just....

I'm enjoying playing through the game with some local gamers. I like what they've done with the various adds, etc. HOWEVER, you barely get to use any of them - you get to 'look' at them and choose a couple and, ultimately, we only chose a couple of 'obvious' options and left a whole lot of others out there. Nice to add new roles, tough to choose between them. 

***no spoilers, but its also important to note that setup and takedown are different from regular Pandemic and those that know Pandemic should pay very close attention to this as it will make a big difference (for instance choosing where to start, what extras you want, etc, - that is done AFTER the board is set up which impacts things quite a bit. when the game is over be sure to read the next appropriate steps before putting things away as it can have a bearing on some additional decisions for the next 'months')

Definitely not the "best game evahh", but it's a very well made campaign, well using the Legacy stick. I'm in the middle of the campaign, and loving it, but I don't forsee wanting to have a second run at it.

EDIT: Since the Legacy hasn't been doing anything as dramatic as it did in Risk: Legacy, and my not-too-fondness of Pandemic is starting to kick in, I'll rate it a little lower.

We played it every night until we finished the season.  Very addicting, very fun.  The biggest downside is that once you've completed the season you can't play it anymore.  There were times when there was a feeling of urgency that you normally don't get from playing a board game.  We even grew attached to some of the characters we used along the way (we loved our super-medic).  With a lot of board games once you come up with a good strategy, you can usually stick to that strategy and have success.  The ever changing rules in this game forces you to change your strategy as you play, which is a good thing.

Combination of two of my favorite games/concepts and designers!

Finished the campaign this weekend (May 2016). This was an amazing experience. Combining my experiences with reading reviews has increased my depth of understanding of what I loved about the game. I also see what frustrated others.
It is worth considering the story arc of the game. January, we had all kinds of anticipation just by seeing the stickers that came in the game and options like cities panicking. But then, even midway through game one we had to deal with a change to the basic game rules and a changed disease! We mostly loved the story buildup and we liked that we were fighting "zombies" because it gave a B movie vibe and we don't like to think of the world actually ending by disease. We knew we were getting into a weird situation by teaming up with the military but the game gave us good reason to do it, just like a team of doctors who are over their heads with the situation. We worked hard to complete the first search, and that was a small misstep in the game creation; since the reward did not payoff. Then came the big reveal; we lost an important character, and cursed the game designers while enjoying the twisting story and the cool components of text to read. The later searches were a little better since they led to story development. We guessed we would be spreading cures and then doing a final hunt and then we were right. By the end, we are not even curing diseases! While we expected to December to have some kind of final hunt; it was difficult, but not the highlight. The highlight was the traitor reveal. So after August and the access to vacines, the game plays out on a downward trend instead of a final boss bottle. The December boss battle felt challenging but then worked out okay; thanks to the Binoculars cards. So the arc of the story has the biggest height in August or so. Not what we expected, but it did not bother us either.
Comments have people most upset about two things: the one time to search in October and the points taken off for not doing that. (200 points). There are more points also for not destroying military bases but less upset about that. Related to this, it is unclear if the final scoring works or not, and the final texts are a bit brief compared to the investment into the game, but we were not let down either.  We felt like our score and final story line matched our expectations. Other people upset about the whole stickering and game design are just not the main voices, even if they are vocal. Look this game is number one!

No reason to play the same board; ready to frame it!

An evolving game. You play through the campaign once and your experience will be unique to your copy of the game. Outstanding idea!

It is hard to rate this game, but the concept in itself is worth a lot.

We own both the red and the blue edition and will play one (red) with just the two of us and the other (blue) with two of our friends.

A fine legacy game that has the support of the solid format of Pandemic, but at the end of the day still feels like Pandemic with a few minor twists. The story is barely there, though can become very investing at key points. Some of the game is incredibly luck-based in an almost frustrating manner. Certainly not a 10/10, and I'm not sure I would spend the money on it again even if I could play it fresh.

We are in June and I can confidently give this a 10.  This has probably replaced base pandemic for me.  I look forward to completing the campaign and using the end game map as our 'normal' pandemic map moving forward.  Even trying to mix In the Lab in with it.

As for the Legacy part, I love it.  When a game ends I cannot wait to play again, which is the sign of a great game.  There are agonizing decisions between games and I can't wait to flip over new cards in the legacy deck or open a punch box.

:thumbsup: What you sacrifice now will affect all your future plays. It becomes not only about how to win a game, but also about how to minimise the damage done in the long run. I think Pandemic meshed perfectly with the Legacy framework.
:thumbsup: We enjoyed it greatly with 2 players and didn't find the campaign to be too easy. We lost or almost lost enough times.
:thumbsup: The story is very good. It could be great if it was fleshed out a little more, with more text and some images, but for something you read entirely as card text, it still creates an impressive amount of immersion. And it's tied closely to the gameplay and decision making too. We often found ourselves trying to predict what will happen next in the story so that we can make the right choice now, and it wasn't always easy.
[b][color=green]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:?block: We played the Legacy game 17 times, plus 2 learning games. You cannot play this after you complete the campaign in any way intended by the design. Is the price tag too expensive for 12-24 plays? It's for you to decide.
:!block: Adding rule stickers to the rulebook/board and keeping track of how the rules change after every game is not something everyone can do easily. Make sure there's a player in your group who will be comfortable with keeping track of new rules.
:!block: With variable setup, introduction of new rules, and post-game upgrade selection we found that the games takes much longer than the stated 60 minutes.
[b][color=red]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:thumbsdown: Ultimately, whether you will like the game or not depends heavily on whether you like the gameplay of Pandemic or not. Legacy is an improvement overall, but it's still the same game at the core. I think I find Pandemic just a little too light/simplistic, and my rating for Legacy reflects that too.
:thumbsdown: I didn't like the pace at which new rules and mechanisms were added to the game. Sometimes it felt like we didn't have enough time to explore a game element before we had to move on.
:thumbsdown: Having 2 tries to win a month for December objectives means that the finale will be too easy and a little anti-climatic. There's no way we could have lost on our second try in December. I would rather lose in December period, than lose on the first try and then have the easiest victory ever on the second try.
:thumbsdown: Pandemic itself has a few non-thematic mechanisms, like for example the way players can exchange cards. Legacy does not improve those, and it also adds some relationship effects that are hard to justify thematically too.
:thumbsdown: There is scoring at the end, and the fact that it's secret makes you unable to make optimal decisions to maximize your score. In the end we were saying, "If only we knew that this particular thing will be scored!"

It is not as testosterone driven as Risk Legacy. The story arc begins slowly and a bit less than halfway through it gets intense. The difficulty increases step by step, and so does rules complexity. The game also has mechanisms to encourage you to use the new abilities that are unlocked. I would probably not play through the game a second time, currently it seems like the game would be too easy if you knew which upgrades become important later on.

First I thought the game might be too easy, but in June/ July we lost three games in a row and we are struggling to keep things under control.

A few months later, we tend to win more often again but the story arc has made another turn and we expect unpleasant things to happen in the last months of the game. We will see. Also, the game balancing mechanism of funding will soon do its job: When you win games, you get less good event cards, so the next game will be more challenging. Oh, and a very good and really useful character died, so we will have to completely change our strategy.

The next months were a mix of insanely difficult and then rather easy months. In the end, the final was a bit anticlimactic but satisfying. 

If you are playing the game, my advice would be: Every life saved matters.

Like many people I was very enamored with this game when I first played it. However, after completing the game rather quickly and looking back on it, I have to say it really wasn't all that great. It's good and I enjoyed playing it but it really feels like it could have been better. Branching paths would have increased the fun of this game immensely and would have aloud for more interesting replays with new boards. While I do plan to play a second game of it with a different group of friends I find I am less excited than when I started my second board in Risk Legacy, there just doesn't seem to be too much that can be different. I hope a lot of the people that have given this game such high ratings look back after they finish it and reevaluate their rating as right now I feel it is vastly over rated on BGG.

WHAT - A - TREAT! It's the first Legacy style game I played and I'm loving it. Tearing cards apart feels a little strange still but I'm sure it'll grow on me. What I can say about this game is, for me, that it contains many "christmases" in a single box. The original christmas, where your heart beats because you're so eager to open the box and you have no clue about what's inside. Not the christmas where you have a list of of things you want and where you expect your personal Santas to get it processed. I'm dying to see what's behind the doors of the dossiers and what surprises still wait in the packages. I'm totally enarmored with what this game does with and for me. Plus the original Pandemic is a game that is very high on the immersive side in my book. This one tops it easily. The original Pandemic triggered my interest in cooperative games and while my interest abated in the meantime, Pandemic Legacy restored it. And it restored it with a bang!

Oh Pandemic Legacy
A game not yet broken
Whose name is oft spoken
By so many a reviewer
Though your life ends in a sewer
Why is your destiny so cruel?
Discarded like a common tool
The murder of a game
Absolutely no shame
I can no longer watch this
Although I was once an accomplice
But as I broke you
You broke my heart

I think Pandemic is a pretty great game, and the Legacy experience elevates it in so many ways.  This is a fantastic campaign, which I played with my whole family.  We were all like kids at Christmas each time we got to open envelopes and boxes.  PL is way more entertaining than regular Pandemic, and even though I know how it all turns out at the end, I would gladly embark on the entire journey again.

*Spoiler-free comment below*

I feel like I'm going to look back on this as a cheap stunt, just a way to get us to buy a more expensive version of an exhausted game by intentionally withholding certain elements until they come up during the game.

But goddamn is it fun. I'm not even the biggest fan of Pandemic in general, but this is just great.

One thing that it does to improve Pandmic, besides the obvious primal experience of getting to open new things from game to game, is it gives the game more focus. Now you have certain areas that might be more important from game to game. You have certain things that you might want to accomplish besides simply curing the diseases. You might prioritize a certain section of the board to avoid outbreaks because of permanent game effects that could potentially happen, instead of just going straight for the cure each time. If it becomes apparent that you're going to lose late in a game, you might even just try to mitigate as much damage as possible instead of even worrying about trying to win.

For me this adds a much-needed layer onto the Pandemic system. In regular Pandemic the decisions were mostly obvious. Legacy offers more to think about simply by having permanent repercussions.

I highly recommend this game. It could even be my game of the year, but 2015 has been an incredibly strong year for good games so I'm not sure yet.

It's pretty good. Very interesting concept and the first Legacy game I've played. The mystery really gets you going and having a new element of the game to pay attention to every now and then adds an interesting twist. I have one major problem with it though, which is that it rewards failure and punishes success (the number of event cards goes up if you lose and down if you win). The month-winning bonus counteracts this a bit but I absolutely hate when games do this. I get that it is basically a necessity to keep the game balanced but that doesn't mean I have to like it. A comparatively minor complaint is that as the rules get longer and longer you inevitably cheat for or against yourselves. Unlike a normal game where you get the hang of complex rules after a few plays you can't get used to this game.

Wow, this game is full of surprises. I'm amazed that adding 'destructive' elements to the game is so much fun and adds so much tension. And that it works so well to get everyone at the tip of their chair, session after session, is really impressive. Also, it almost feels like unpacking a new game every time we're allowed to open a secret box. I love it!

Fantastic game! One of my favourites. 
Love how the board changes as you play, love the new characters, love plying pandemic with objectives that keep changing!
I don't mind the fact that once we beat the game that the experience wouldn't be the same a second play through. 

My only issue, was on the 3rd last month; one of the legacy cards wasn't clear on what to do. So we got stuck in the last month because of it and had to go back and replay the second last month. Just was a huge error on the game and ultimately ruined our enjoyment a bit on our play through.

I never really loved Pandemic. It was always one that I was willing to play if other people wanted to, but I'm not the biggest fan. That being said, I had a great group of people to play Legacy with, and it made it a great experience. I probably won't play again, but I wouldn't be surprised if other people did. $60 for at least 12 games seems reasonable for me. A lot of people hate the idea of a disposable game, but for  the experience, I'd say it's worth the money. I'm sure something may come along that does the Legacy co-op better, but for now, it's great if you're looking for a unique experience.

Overall it's...fine. My gaming group just finished our first play through of May (which we lost), and at this point I'm kind of dreading finishing the rest of the campaign. The changing storyline of this one is interesting, but it feels like both a slog to get through the whole campaign and stressful to deal with the changing circumstances and ever-adjusting rule set. By the time we complete this campaign (if we do), this will be, by far, the game in my collection that I've played the most, but nowhere near one I've enjoyed the most. Ultimately I think I prefer standard Pandemic or Pandemic: The Cure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I can't see ever giving Pandemic Legacy a 10, and I feel like the score may degrade with time. The narrative driven gameplay is interesting, but let's be real: the story is pretty bland until September. I think this game would've benefitted from an Above and Below style treatment with some more robust storytelling than a few cards could provide. Also, I don't think this should really be labeled as a two player game without the caveat that 2 people should play 2 characters each. Maybe it is just me, but I can't see ever playing Pandemic without the medic, so I rarely got to explore other options as none of the other characters comes even close in efficiency. I don't know; I enjoyed it well enough, but it didn't blow my face off like people seemed to imply that it would.

Perfect through and through. Pandemic was already an amazing game and Legacy just made every move so tense and exciting with cities getting ruined or characters dying from a wrong play (or intentional sacrifices).

The excitement of opening up the advent-calendar boxes between games is wonderful, the new characters and tweaks on the gameplay are generally interesting, and (of course) the base game is a really solid base on which to build.  I rather enjoyed playing through Season 1.  That said, I don't see how this could ever be the #1 game on BGG.  It has a fixed shelf life, forces certain choices on you, and doesn't tell you how to score until the game is over.  I like the Legacy idea, but I'm not sure I'm up for Season 2.

These were definitely the most interesting games of Pandemic I've played.  There's a lot to like and a lot of positive development on the "legacy" front.  That said it didn't do anything truly ground breaking either.

I had a few complaints with the structure and catchup mechanics and I think they could have forked the story into different paths rather than just gifting you stuff if you failed to progress on your own.

But otherwise it was 30 hours of fun!  And now we get to burn the entire game in a dumpster fire.

I was not a huge Pandemic fan, so this game gave me pause. But after playing through the entire game (19 games total), I am not sure I've ever had such a great gaming experience. From jaw-dropping moments to last second victories or explosive defeats, this game gave us an experience we'll not soon forget. We played it over many months, with long breaks in between so we never were bored. In fact, my only suggestion might be a notebook of "the story so far" so you can remember where you left off on your next game. But it wasn't so complex that we couldn't remember with just a little review each time.

Stellar design, and an amazing experience.

The 'legacy' element adds an extra layer of strategy to a game that is quite tactical by nature.

Being able to plan you approach for each 'month' and choose your characters/upgrades according to a long term goal is very unique experience.

An yes, what upgrades, what characters, what structures(and where you build them) matters a lot.

It's also one of the rare games where you want to 'win more'. Taking a riskier approaches to mission is rewarded with better/more upgrades for the next.

I love campaign systems and I really enjoy Pandemic. Pandemic Legacy really felt it was designed for me. 

Having played a full campaign I can only say that is is by far the best campaign system I've seen in a board game and is exceptionally fun. 

The pros: Easy to learn, gets progressively (at a fine pace) more complex. Super fast setup for such a full of everything game. Zero downtime (if you consider each action a team action to be discussed, as we do). Great narrative, perfectly tough decisions thanks to the amazing deteriorating cities campaign mechanism. Legacy deck creates a great overlaying story that adds thrills, a few surprises and keeps all players guessing for what comes next but only for the first campaign playthrough. It's great fun to play, and the added complexity discourages the alpha player syndrome. Great sense of accomplishment from game to game, and amazing at the end of the campaign where the whole progress of the group is tracked. RP elements with great attachment to the game characters, which grow from basic roles to characters full of traits, scars, experience and stories to tell - you really want to keep them alive! The game is very difficult to fully beat (best outcome), especially in the first play through the campaign. Stellar variability and replayability as the possible effective combinations of the roles with the upgrades, relations, events and equipment is mindblowing, and the possible team strategies really a lot and diverse.* (but see also cons as to why replayability can't shine in this game)

Cons: The game may be greatly replayable, but most of the components are also disposible. Each box comes with enough for just a single playthrough the campaign, and the rules actually encourage that. This means that playing through the campaign a second time to have a second great time demands either a new copy of the game, or some preparation and customization that may seriously detract from setup and ease of play. The first play through the campaign does have some added difficulty due to the unknown story, second play through should be easier because of that but still not easy to reach total victory. The game difficulty is very deceptive, as the group may achieve its objectives repeatedly and think all is good while the world is getting ravaged, when in fact they should be looking to prevent the world from being slowly destroyed which is the most important thing in the game, makes total thematic sense, is what counts in the end but may still elude some players as it's not "in the current objectives". Finally and despite the many supporting mechanisms that try to balance things, lost games really make the campaign much harder (again, even if it's not apparent for new groups), while won games make the campaign easier, though that's not by a wild or gamebreaking margin.

Overall the Pandemic Legacy succesfully introduces a campaign to the Pandemic game, and the result is absolutely amazing. Playing while knowing that your current decisions will affect all future plays effectively transforms your 90min experience to a ~1500min experience that is played in episodes (months) and can be easily saved. If you thought f.e. that Mage Knight was epic, with its 200-250min memorable experience think again. Pandemic Legacy is easily 6-7 times more epic, while retaing better easy of play and much faster setup. Now imagine a Mage Knight with a similar campaign system, and come and try and convince me that the "Legacy system" is something we should discourage.

I get it, it's a well made production. But i still don't understand how so many people call it an epic story, full of twist or anything else.
Me and my friends (5 persons total) really don't have particular emotions while playing it. Nothing is expecially surprising or innovative. Characters are anonimous. Plot twist are boring. Mix that up with the fact the the game is for the 75% the same every game you play.

By far the worst part of this game is that the directions are VERY poorly written. Every month we spend far more time trying to figure out what the rules are then we actually spend playing. If you (foolishly) decide to play anyway, MAKE SURE TO CHECK THE FORUMS FOR RULE INTERPRETATIONS BEFORE YOU READ THE GIBBERISH THAT COMES WITH THE GAME. Even once you have the rules figured out for one month, it's difficult to remember what they are throughout the game because the so many things change from game to game (the rules don't change all that drastically, but they DO change strategy considerably, so even if the rule change isn't that huge, its importance usually is). The actual game seems okay at best, but it's not nearly good enough to make up for all the frustration of trying to figure out the rules. Other annoyances include: 
- It has a million little pieces that are hard to keep track of. 
- It's designed to only play through once (which is one or two games each for 12 "months").

Bought it on Saturday, played 3 warm-ups on Sunday, 1 more on Tuesday and then played the January game right after. Legacy mechanics make the game unbelievably tense, heightening the sense that we really need to work together at our best to beat the game (and save our characters, cities, etc...)

One of the best experiences you could ever want from a cooperative legacy game. Me and my wife thoroughly enjoyed this.

RATING: 7.5
There were many reasons I wanted to try this. First, I'm a fan of Pandemic and have a couple of expansions for the original game. Second, I've been intrigued by the Legacy format for a while now, and really want to discover all the secrets and have a game where surprises crop up. Third, this game is getting a lot of praise and recognition and so I wanted to experience what everyone was getting so excited about. And lastly, Rob's in my game group and up till now I'd never played any of his games and felt a little guilty about that.

So I asked a couple of people if they wanted to go in on a copy and what do you know, but a pandemic just happened to break out right then and there. So I won't post many (if any) spoilers (although only being two games in it's not like I know a ton of them yet anyway).

The first game is basically a way for people who don't know Pandemic to get up to speed. There's some new stuff and you'll quickly discover some new twists after the first game. It's still got the feel of original Pandemic, so if you didn't love that game, I don't know that this will do anything to change that. But if you like Pandemic, this is definitely an interesting addition that throws you some new things and makes for some interesting decisions.

After we finished our first play, everybody really wanted to play again, so we doubled down on February, which was a cakewalk for us. We managed to eradicate two diseases and came close to eradicating a third. That fourth disease and those darned red cubes though...

One of the most important things with a co-op is getting a good group together, as the game is made or broken by the group interaction. Our group is having a blast and I'm really looking forward to the rest of the campaign. I can't wait to play again.

About [thing=161936][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=161936][/thing] is a cooperative game fundamented in an older design ([thing=30549][/thing]) and based in the legacy format - which means that things done in previous plays have effect  (changes and additions, both in rules, game state and on the board itself) in sequential plays.

The legacy format also have unique surprises - as it builds a campaign in almost a TV series sort of way: throwing curve balls at the players, surprises, new characters and new situations. Not only this: the bad stuff also stays, which means that characters can die, places be taken by riots, collapse and fall completely to the disease, making them almost unreachable.

However, [thing=161936][/thing] isn't an open world. It isn't a RPG sand box, where anything can happen at any time and the path is in the hands of the players. No. It isn't also exactly like a TV show, in which you are just the viewer, unable to participate, just watching the plot unfold. [thing=161936][/thing] stays in the middle ground - it is akin to a gamebook: all the elements of the story were already written (put in the box), but the path you will make, while not completely free - you must pick paths already made, see situations previously thought - the whole thing, in spite of not being all up to you, feels like your own and unique path, a one of a kind journey, similar to others, still (almost) never quite like them.

Therefore, [thing=161936][/thing] is a board game equivalent of a gamebook, with an evolving and emerging story, with twists and turns, with surprises and mysteries ahead, strengthened by an already proven and well-liked design. All put together made for huge hit.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Players have 4 actions per turn, and most of these will involve moving (in several different ways) and removing diseases. All players use characters with special abilities. The usual goal is to prevent outbreaks from happening, while trying to get enough samples (cards) in order to develop cures for the diseases.

The game is lost when there are too many outbreaks, the draw deck runs out or all the cubes of a color are on the board. Players win when all the cures are found.

This is the basic [thing=30549][/thing]. Differences will occur.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
How to best use the available 4 actions each turn. How to best coordinate with everyone else, in order to control the spreading of the diseases, to prevent outbreaks, to build research facilities, to share knowledge, and other possibilites.

Unlike most board games, the developing campaign and legacy format puts a weight to every decision as its effects can ripple into later plays. This spice things up and make the decisions harder to make, which is good.

There are also decisions made [i]in between[/i] plays, like most games with campaigns - what to add, who to play with, which thing will benefit the most? This part, more often than not, is what takes PL apart from [thing=30549][/thing].

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Very good production quality;
- Campaing with a developing story;
- Mysteries and surprises throughout the plays;
- Difficulty adjusted by the game itself;
- The legacy format makes the players more engaged in the single plays and with the overall arc.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Limited replay value for the mysteries;
- Luck of the draw can have big effects on plays;
- Alpha player allowance.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
In a constant Christmas mood - opening boxes with excitement on the heart and gleaming eyes, alongside a sticker fest. I do love stickers - I remember when I got a model airplane, with several stickers to put on it. The building of the model was too much for my young age, so my dad took care of it, but I was responsible for the stickers - not all turn out ok and in the proper place, but my fun was the same regardless. I still, as and adult, like to put stickers on things - it simply [i]feels right[/i].

Now, many people talked about how they feel regarding the limited number of plays in the campaing of [thing=161936][/thing]. There were many saying is simply too much hype, too high rating and too expensive for a game one can play under two dozens of times and be done with it. Several others pointed out that many games with high replay value keep these in store, being played rarely and, most definitely, less than the projected maximum number of plays of the PL's campaign; and some added that PL can be played as regular [thing=30549][/thing], with some adaptations, once the campaign is done.

How do I feel about it? I don't really care. One of my all time favorite game is [thing=2511][/thing], and this one has around half the amount of plays PL have. For me, it isn't the amount of games I can milk from a game that interest me, it is the experience I got from each of them. Sure, if a game allows for truly amazing experiences and has a high replay value, even better! But it seems that the limited life (much like the real one) helps bringing a sense of keener enjoyment, of savouring every detail, of looking with wonder to every nook and cranny. The senses and emotions are heightened. Maybe this plays a part in [thing=161936][/thing] shooting up the charts and ending up as the #1 game here in BGG - not in spite of its limited plays, but [i]because of it[/i].

The gameplay, for the most part, is vanilla [thing=30549][/thing], but put in a much more colorful and exciting frame. Still, there are many changes - the more months pass, the more is the game state different. Some major rules suffer tweaks.

This is great, overall, both to attract new players that aren't interested in [thing=30549][/thing] (due to the differences and legacy format), and also those that do like [thing=30549][/thing] (due to the similar mechanisms and feel of play). Yet, we had a problem: we found that [thing=161936][/thing] is best suited for constant plays in a small frame of time. Our three person campaign started december 5th of 2015, and ended in april 18th of 2017. This meant long hiatus of play, and once we returned, re-learning all the tweaks and differences was a chore, and usually something was overlooked (like forgetting a possible action during play). Sometimes we even grumbled a little at the ideia of returning to the campaign, knowing that we would had to freshen up rules and passed events - what had happened thus far. Our play style and commitments simply weren't best suited to enjoy [thing=161936][/thing] in its fullest state - and its attractiveness wore off, as opening packs and dicovering new things on it weren't exciting enough when they were cold in the shelf for months.

Coupled the less than ideal experience, we also found the story lacking. I saw many comparing the campaign and the legacy format and the closest an RPG can get from a board game. Is likely true. Still, the unfolding story was pretty weak, the writing subpar, with cliches and repetitiveness creeping in - and the end is simply lazy; if it was an awful thing, maybe due to trying to make it to grandiose or epic, I could forgive it; but the laziness and its unfufilling nature is much harder to excuse. Anyway, the board game format do help in lessening this weakness, since the mechanism take over and the story goes on the back sit. This would be a weak RPG adventure, a bad film and a terrible novel. In the end, what bothered me the most was the wasted opportunities - using the legacy to truly make unique experiences of gameplay, not just "I got red, you got black", with many of the major plots happening at the same time regardless of what is done.

I understand the limitations of the physical world: it isn't feasible to produce endless paths, cards, tokens, etc, to accomodate all possibilities. In an RPG the narrator swings something from the sleeve to carry on; on movies or novels the writer just conducts the plot; on a videogame the digital for more freedom, but is still limited. Yet, a few additions and changes, like in a pick-your-path gamebook (which would make a finer comparison with the openess of a campaign in board games than RPG), would make the experience be better. A simple: if you did X, that make Y. There is some of this, but not enough to change the story and lead it to difference places.

Overall, [thing=161936][/thing] started as a big promise and went into the disappointment territory. We considered it to be better than regular [thing=30549][/thing]. as it gives reasons to return to it: an unfolding story, surprises, twists, tweaks and changes. I like campaigns and the legacy format, as I have an RPG background (playing since '95, mostly as DM) and want thematic and memorable experiences in my gameplay. [thing=161936][/thing] opened the path, but is still all muddy and uneven; it is matter of waiting for someone to take the path and turn it into a proper road to awesome.

I love the concept and some of the execution. But I'm sorry to say that as a two-player game it was laughably easy at the beginning (new developments happened only at the end of a play and had little direct effect), and ridiculously tough near the end. It's still Pandemic but I think for two players, I prefer On the Brink.

RATING: 9
This is a truly great game.

The story the game takes you along is extremely well thought out, and works so well.

It's been designed to be very tight, and events and circumstances happen which will test you, but the game never becomes impossible.

By the end of it, you'll realise that everything that happened, the game made happen, even if you felt it was your own doing.  This is great design, and truly shows how well thought out it was, and also how well executed it was too.

Truly worthy of the hype.  The only negative is that it has limited play...but you can still play Pandemic on it at the end of it.

I can't wait for next season!

Legacy games are a hard sell, even to boardgame enthusiasts. Do you want to have a finite number of times you can play the game you just bought? And especially in the case of Pandemic Legacy; the game you just dropped $100+ on?

But when a game can pull off what this one can then the answer is yes, yes you do. 

The format allows for such tense rounds, so many genuinely shocking surprises and that very pure kind of excitement you experience when you get to UNBOX THE HIDDEN THING!

Pandemic Legacy also enjoys the benefit of having SUCH a strong game to build from. Pandemic is a staple of this hobby for a reason. It's approachable, yet challenging. It's thematic and evocative and yet abstracts enough of itself to not bog its players down. It is a natural fit for a campaign, and the designers show such confidence in their decisions on how much to shake things up (and how frequently to do so). 

This game has generated such intense hype, and it was catapulted to number one on BGG (and was only just bumped down by Gloomhaven at the time of writing). But in what is a rare case; this game earns all the praise it has received. It is just as exciting an experience for new and veteran gamers. Grab a group and go in on it together, and enjoy one of the best and most unique boardgames on the market.

RATING: 7
This game is a truly impressive production, the narrative in this game is unlike anything we've seen in the board game world before, and it is a superb accomplishment.  While I am a fan of the legacy mechanics, I'm not a big fan of Pandemic, so I was curious to see if the Legacy aspect would make a significant enough impact.  All in all, the gameplay is just Pandemic where a few extra rules are added occassionally.  By the end it does become quite bloated and it is tough to remember everything that happened.  Some say that playing this game is like being inside a TV drama, but I have to disagree.  The story in the game isn't nearly as immersive as the hype would have you believe (if you're looking for immersive story, play an RPG instead).  It is, however, an extremely unique and creative group experience.  If you like Pandemic and have 4 players that can consistently get together, this is a no-brainer.  I like it and plan to finish it, but I am still waiting for a Legacy game that suits my tastes better.

Red Box. Played completely through. 5 game cards as well as  numerous Legacy Deck cards have been destroyed. Many (but not all) of the stickers have been placed and that is reflected on the board and cards which are now marked with them. Some of the board and cards also feature writing that was written during the campaign. All plastic game pieces have been inventoried and remain in great condition.

I enjoyed Pandemic as an entry-level game. Even as an experienced player, the unlucky card draws destroyed us frequently. As such, the game became a slog and the story did nothing to keep me at the table. We ended up opening the rest of the boxes and quitting after 9 losses and 1 win. I wanted to like this. :(

Is this my favorite game from a mechanical perspective? No. But the solid foundation of a well-designed game like Pandemic is exactly the thing to base a Legacy system on, and that's what kept us coming back for me.  I'm a sucker for RPGs, so the permanent choices you make in this game are like candy to me.  Playing through this with Justin, Feef, and Michael is one of my fondest gaming memories.

well, the events of May make this a solid 10.  for now.  i have some concerns that we are getting painted into playing a smaller subset of roles than i would ideally like (we play 3 player games)... lots of push towards the "green symboled" roles.  still loving it, but would like a reason to pick different roles... then again, that could be coming, or i could be playing unsmarterly.

just finished July and... well, still enjoying the game greatly, but it is in a bit of a lull (SMALL CONCEPTUAL SPOILERS HERE).  I was expecting/hoping for another "story beat" in/around June.  sure there is that 'search' mechanism, but it has not wowed like the first big story beat.  still having fun, but wishing for more at this point.

now through september and i am dropping my rating to a 9.  still having fun, but the story beats are just not there like they were in the first quarter/third of the game.  searchsearchsearch.  a strong finish could up the rating again, but i could see this dropping to a 8-8.5 depending on the finish.  still a LOT of little rules to remember (at least for us).  loving it; just loving it less.

We really, really did not enjoy this game. We were a bit 'Meh.' until April / Box 3, when the entire narrative arc turned to sh!t—and never recovered. Had Box 3 never opened, the game would merely have been disappointingly mediocre in terms of narrative & mechanics, but with a disease mutated into [redacted, but message me and I'll tell you] the game becomes a joke.  

We only made it through by treating it as a joke, a sort of "Bad B-Movie Legacy", to compensate for the trope-ridden, formulaic & obvious narrative and the manipulative & game-breaking mechanics changes introduced & later counteracted by the Legacy deck.

My disappointment was only enhanced by the hype and secrecy surrounding the game—if anyone with taste had remarked on the plot, or if the [redacted] had been spoiled, my expectations would have been appropriately tempered. Alas, I trusted the people who were so happy with the Legacy revelations that their excitement & secrecy had me fooled into remaining un-spoiled.

Pandemic is an alright game.  This is better than that.  I went into this fully expecting to love it.  Halfway through the season.  I'm just not sold on legacy.  It feels like a campaign that just isn't replayable.  I feel like it would be better to just have a replayable campaign system.  Legacy one time use seems like a regression.  It just keeps adding new rules and things to keep track of.  Maybe the second half will improve my opinion of it.

Finished the season 12-5.  Still calling it an 8.  The continual addition of new rules was frustrating.  I expected a deeper story.

I enjoy this game a lot and would definitely rate it a 9 or even 9.5 except this "legacy" issue with tearing cards is BS and permanent stickers.  I don't care about the price or anything like that but it's like saying I LOVE "Star Wars" but once you watched it you can't watch it again and have to wait for the next in series OR must buy the dvd again.  Just stupid and money grab as far as I am concerned...the game should have removable stickers and also those saying the mystery of the boxes is cool, I agree except just like the movie concept, now you know what happens you should still be able to watch over and over. (also even if you fix the legacy issue yourself, it should have been fixed by devs, of course the money grab issue)

Play this. 

It's unlike anything else I've played so far. Completely worth the investment of time and money.

Has what no other game does: closure. 
I don't have the time needed to play all my games to satisfaction, such is the renaissance of gaming that we are living in. However, knowing that this one has an end coming, that we can "complete" it, is exhilarating for me. It makes every play session more meaningful and intense. The way the game changes and evolves with each success and failure is simply beautiful.

Give it a go.
Worth it.

Don't like the idea of not being able to play it once it's finished? Fair enough, probably not your thing. This is a new concept and it is fair to object to a change in the conventions of gaming... if you are... the kind of person that doesn't like.. new things..? 
Literally can't understand why this is a problem.

The only problem with this game is that it makes me want to play vanilla pandemic less and less.

A really thematic and unique experience - I am already looking forward to my next play. The only drawback I can think of, is that the original Pandemic, though still fun, has not aged very well in my opinion. Returning to it, I realized that the game is quite random (you definitely need luck to win) and...mathy (counting turns and frequently scanning the discard pile). So, if you like Pandemic - chances are you will love this. If you don't - try before you buy. Worked out fine for me :-).

This is the best co-op game I've ever played, and provided one of my most memorable gaming experiences. I hope every gamer gets to experience this at some point because it was such a radical departure from every other game on the market.

Played some warm-up rounds, then the actual game. For one, I already against the whole idea that the game gets destroyed over the course of play. That's not what board games are about, they're about playing multiple times indefinitely, at least in my opinion that's what they're about. Next, this game isn't that great. It gets very repetitive. The strategy isn't that involved and isn't so complicated that it requires an entire group of players to play. Was fun for about and hour, but then I just stop caring about playing. It was as boring as monopoly. This is very overhyped.

Probably my favorite board game EXPERIENCE I've ever had.... for the first half of the campaign. Really bad luck led to a huge imbalance in the second half of the year that made the game much less fun to play and my group finished with little enthusiasm. Still looking forward to Season 2 though :)

Fabulous game, building on the concepts of a game I already loved. It fills us with excitement and dread every time we sit down to take on a new month.  We talk about what we did and how we accomplished (or failed) our goals for days afterward. A game which stays with you in real life, eliciting real emotions...it's a rare and beautiful thing.

I felt better about this through about the June portion of the game. Then I/we realized that the legacy deck is going to funnel us back to the same point as all other iterations of 'Legacy'. It gives the illusion of being a sandbox game, but there won't be many differences from game to game. On top of that, there were so many new rules, pieces, cards, etc., that it became hard to keep track of strategies and objectives. The difficulty came in keeping track of the complexity. That's not the kind of strategy/game I want to tackle.

I know this game is getting great reviews, I understand why a lot of people like it, but I just cannot get behind it...

The game is divided into months, each month is a game session, you have one year to cure the disease.  If you fail a month, you are given a single second chance each month to re-do it.

But..  This game just does everything wrong for me.
Firstly: It's a public knowledge co-op game, meaning your team is only as good as its dumbest player.  Which for me translates to "Oh it's a solitaire game!  Like Forbidden Island, Xenoshyft, and XCOM."

Secondly: It's non-replayable, similar to Risk Legacy but cranked up to 11.  With Risk Legacy, the first 15 games shape the map, then you can just play on the completed map if you want.  With this, once you've played the 2-24 required sessions (each roughly one hour) it's over, you're done, buy a new box if you want, but it'll be the same story.

Third: It's $70.

So, if you really have a bad time, you can be that person who drops $70 to buy a non-replayable game, only to have to throw it out after 2 hours.
If you're a lucky or skilled person with a good team of enthusiastic players, you'll get about 16-18 hours of enjoyment out of it.  For $70.

This could be the game for you after you divvy it up, (18 hours gameplay, $70 game, 4 players playing, roughly $1/hour per player for fun)
but it's not the game for me.  Had I been the person to pay for it, it simply would have made me horribly depressed I just spent so much money only for it to be something non-permanent.  Even worse so if a nice but slow-witted player ruined it for everyone by making it a 4-6 hour purchase that we never got to see the end of.

That's a good place for a closing note:  It's a board game where if you don't beat it: either buy a new one and start over...  cheat...  or just pack it back up with that niggling doubt you'll never be able to complete it, because it's designed that way...

While at first Pandemic Legacy seems like a step forward for the legacy style games it's actually two steps back. The same story plays out whether you win or lose each month and the different hero upgrades don't really add any abilities that didn't exist in either the pandemic base game or one of its many expansions. Risk: Legacy was an amazing experience that was a completely different experience playing the first game to playing the last. Unfortunately Pandemic: Legacy just rehashes the same old pandemic mechanics.

We're just starting April....and it's been a wonderful ride thus far.  The excitement of opening the various "Advent calendar doors" totally makes the game!  Loving all the tweaks! Can't wait to see what unfolds from here.

Each individual game probably rates an "8" for me, but the whole experience kicks it up a notch or two.  It was a heck of a ride....very engaging.  Lots of unexpected surprises.  It was a really Great game!                    Final game ranking  614 / 1000

RATING: 8
Pros: cooperative legacy game, highly thematic, roleplaying with special skillsets in a legacy setting, highly tactical, varied game objectives in a legacy setting

Cons: prone to quarterbacking, high degree of luck, high number of minor rule changes related to legacy setting means looking up rules before each game

This is the only legacy game I have ever played, and as of January 2018 my gaming group and I are only halfway through the game. Every time I play it, I am simultaneously struck by the ingenuity of legacy mechanics and overwhelmed at the minutiae of rule changes between each game. I dread each set-up, as I have to go through the rulebook each time and make sure we are not missing something important. For this reason alone, I do not rate this game higher. However, during and at the end of each game, I'm also ready for the next one. It's amazing what a simple, ongoing narrative does to an already fantastic game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
We blasted through this campaign quickly. It's an elegant design that integrates a great narrative into an already excellent co-op game. Highly recommended.

I do think that it is at the pricier end of things considering the lack of replay value. We also made a couple of (relatively minor) rules errors which was frustrating as there was no real way to 'roll back' our play-through. 

The legacy system is great and we certainly had a lot of fun, so felt like we had our money's worth. I actually found it quite liberating to mark and even destroy components. BUT I do think that there could be ways to achieve similar results (using apps for example) without permanently damaging/ altering the components. 

These are all minor nit-picks about a fantastic overall experience. This is certainly a step forward for table top game design. I look forward to seeing what comes next!

So far I have played 5 of the 12 months with a consistent group of 4 over weeks. We have been playing 1 or 2 games weekly. It has been the most enjoyable gaming experience I have ever had.

I have played it and it was fine, I would prefer to just to stick to the original Pandemic honestly.  The replayability is an issue in the end, and the fact you need to keep playing so many times with the same group of people.  For me, not a realistic setting for a board game in a normal group which varies from time to time in numbers and people.

Enjoyed this one. Would happily play again with a different group, though it would be a changed experience knowing the plot. Looking forward to Season 2. That said, I'm unsettled about the notion of use-once games -- not because I don't think this game is deserving of the money for the experience it offers, but because I see its success establishing a dangerous trend among games publishers who see this a means to increased revenue.

I suppose I should take solace in the fact that mediocre legacy-style games won't be played the requisite number of times for the purchase of a second copy. In that case, I guess my quibble may be self-correcting.

Quite simply the best gaming experience I ever had. Looking forward to Season 2 and other games with a legacy mechanic. I see incredible potential here.

This game definitely is susceptible to the alpha gamer problem.

I generally dislike cooperative games, partially because of the alpha gamer problem, and partially because the solitaire aspects can make a group's AP problems worse.  

Even though I generally don't like coop games, I've decided to play this with my group anyway for 3 reasons:

1. It's now the #1 game on BGG
2. The Legacy aspects are interesting
3. My friends in this game group are fans of coop games, and I know that they'll make it fun.

My rating of a 6 is pretty much my ceiling for a standard coop game.  Non-standard  coop games are games like Hanabi where the alpha gamer is not a problem, and they are not subject to this ceiling.

Had an opportunity to play through a campaign with a local gaming group.  I don't really understand the love and hatred this game has garnered.  In my opinion it's a decent coop with a fairly unique legacy mechanic thrown in.  I thought the story was pretty silly. but that wasn't a huge surprise, since this is a board game.  Overall I'm not a huge fan, but my co-players would disagree. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Amazing experience, the story is interesting with cool twists, it manages to keep the core gameplay of regular pandemics and adding a few rules each game.

=> like the other legacy games, threw everything to the trash once completed, but will definitely play S2.

[+] story is good, many characters to choose from, the way the board and character evolve, the permanant death & city destruction give real stake
[-] replayability is low (of course), ~17 games, 1h each; I'm not a huge fan of pandemic, I think the gameplay is a bit repetitive and "old fashioned"; didn't like the way positive events are integrated (as a catchup mechanic), sometimes it was better to loose 1/2 scenarios on purpose to strengthen the deck for the harder scenarios (with research); still quite a bit of randomness

RATING: 8.5
I had very high expectations for this game. My wife and I both love base Pandemic, especially when the On the Brink expansion is added in. And all of the reviews that we had read/watched gushed about how good Pandemic Legacy was. But, unfortunately, it did not quite live up to the hype for me.

In this particular case, I think a pros and cons list is the best way to deconstruct my thoughts about the game.

PROS

--The bones of the game are solid. Base Pandemic is in my top 10 games and my wife's top 10, so we enjoyed having that as the starting point for this game.

--I enjoyed being able to try out modules and characters from some of the expansions that we do not currently have. In fact, we might purchase one of the expansions to the base game because of our enjoyment of its modules that cropped up in Legacy.

--I thought that the funded events were a relatively clever way to increase or decrease the difficulty of the game (but see the counterpoint in the cons section).

--I really enjoyed how some of the end-game upgrades enhanced the experience (especially some of the character upgrades).

CONS

--The story was not *nearly* as good as it could have been. After completing the first few months, I thought I could see an interesting direction that the story could have taken, but instead it seems that the designers decided to play it safe and retread tired ground (at least in the board game context).

--While we only lost twice, I could definitely see how a group with more losses could not recover solely with funded event cards. The brilliance of the base game is that you can make it easier or harder by removing or adding epidemic cards to the player deck. For Legacy, they should have instituted a rule whereby if you lose more than, say, two games in a row, then you have the option of either adding two funded events *or* adding one funded event and removing an epidemic card. (There should probably be a minimum number of epidemic cards that need to be in play, but at the same time, a group that has lost three or more times in a row needs something besides two additional funded events.)

--Whenever a certain mechanic was introduced, we usually did our best to take full advantage of it. Unfortunately, that meant that some of the drama/tension that could have happened in certain months (e.g., December) was not realized. Of course, we struggled from time to time throughout the game, but the overall intensity of the game was not as pronounced for us as it perhaps should have been.

--I thought that some of the months were rather monotonous, because new objectives were not introduced. Generally speaking, I feel like the objectives should have changed more depending on how well you did throughout the campaign.

--This was essentially covered in my first point, but the conclusion of the game fell flat for us. It was neither an interesting resolution to the various problems in the game, nor was it true to the spirit of Pandemic.

FINAL ASSESSMENT

Overall, I did enjoy playing Pandemic Legacy: Season 1, but I would probably not replay it, and I have little to no interest in playing Season 2.

In the end I'm happy that I played through this game. Pandemic is one of my favourite coop games (though I do not tend to really love many coop games) and initially through the first 3-4 months I had a really good time. However as the 'season' went on, I started to feel a little exhausted by the whole thing. Some negative points:
- Some of the mechanics introduces approximately half way - and during the second half was really dull.
- I didn't connect to the story at all. In all honesty though I think 'stories' in the board game industry as a whole still has a lot to go on. 
- The ending was probably the most anti climatic ending I have ever witnessed in any form of media.

I recognize it is a good game and I would recommend it if people asked. But I'm in no rush at all to play season 2.

I probably will not play again now that I know things that would change the way I would play...the decisions I'd make. So on that regard not perfect (doubt a game will get a 10 from me), but I think I had more fun with this game than any other...Completed the game, a good one and I would play another round of this game IF I played with a group of new players...but will not play with my wife again (interested to see if 2 character each instead of 1, but rather play something else for now) 

Finished. Will not be getting a second copy as our choices will be impacted. Still leaving the rating as it is a great game that I would recommend or play again. Good times.

I wanted to love this game more but to enjoy it most you have to have a committed group to play regularly for a while. My games have too far apart so it was quite tedious to bring it out and figure out where we are at.  
I found that learning new mechanics everytime or every other time was a little draining.  
My preference would be to just play Pandemic Iberia which took the best parts of Legacy and just put it in as a staple. 
I still give it a high rating because it is an experience unlike anything else.

Even then the 12 months still provide more than enough playtime to be worth it!

An excellent, crazy ride through Pandemic where weird stuff keeps happening that you didn't even think would happen. Only downside is there are only a set amount of games you can play before it can't be played again. But while you are playing, it feels epic.

My group has played through May so far (5-2), and I cannot express enough how much I love this game, while similarly being filled with frustration as to my inability to discuss it people who haven't played yet or aren't up to May or (even worse) who are past May and at risk of spoiling things for me. Need to finish soon!

Only a third the way through. Family enjoys it. I bit the bullet and tore up a card, and it really wasn't that painful. I mean, at some level, all games are only going to be played X times. When you do the math, I've already got way more out of it than a night at the movies.

RATING: 7.5
This game is really difficult to rate. The novelty of the concept make it really enjoyable and based on that alone I would probably rate it a 9 or a 9.5. But we had the problem that the 2-Player game was way too easy (even with all the epidemic cards) and we just breezed through the last three or four months. That destroyed the narrative and led to an anticlimatic conclusion. I also was a tad disappointed that the story unfolded regardless of any choices made by the players - branching pathes with multiple endings would have been really cool.
I am glad I've played this one and it is memorable, but I did not enjoy the last four or so sessions half as much as I enjoyed the game round about the middle of the campaign.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm halfway through the campaign, but I can't help rating the game at this point - this is a fantastic, one of a kind experience that blurs the line between board games and RPGs. Even if you don't like the basic Pandemic, try Legacy just for the sake of seeing the surprises the game will throw at you, it's really worth it. Highly recommended!

[b]/update, January 2018:[/b] Two months left to go. This has been a great ride so far, but I have to say that I don't like the fact that when you lose you just repeat a month with the same "settings". It evokes "geez, we have to go through the same motions again" type of a feeling. Also, I wish that the legacy aspect of the game occured during each session, not between them.

I am a sleever.  Tearing up a card for the first time was exhilarating. It was a very exciting game.  Opening packages, placing stickers, altering cards... it just added an extremely fun element to an already good game.  I highly recommend the legacy concept.  

Long story short... we got about 75% of the way through the game and realized that we had been playing a rule wrong the entire time.  So we scrapped the game and bought it again.  At least now I have both of the boxes...

Great game. Huge evolution from the original pandemic - the game which brought me into this hobby.

All those people who says no replayability should suck it. You can always ignore the stickers and shit and play standard pandemic after its all done. Further more, i have lots more games w huge replayability options which did not even get as many plays as this!

Difficult to rate a game that you can only play X times, so the rating is based on the fun factor and pleasure I've had.

I had the good fortune of playing with a dedicated group (jean27, Pozman and myself) and it was a blast to play. A lot of tension and fun game/rule changes,

The story arc of this game is fantastic and the rule changes come natural over different plays. Do make sure you play this with a dedicated group and in a relative short time period (several weeks).

RATING: 6
Just like Pandemic it's a solo game that you can play with more people if you want. The number of characters largely affects the difficulty, playing with 2 characters is ridiculously easy with good character selection compared to 4 characters. No hints in the storytelling what gives points in the end (which is not revealed until the game is finished and is a bit silly for this kind of game) and one wholly random event can affect you a lot or not at all depending on err... randomness.
Also the legacy element is silly and unneeded, it could easily just have been created as a normal replayable campaign game.

I expected much more from the high ratings, but it's still an okay solo experience.

[This comment is SPOILER FREE]

[End Game] Simply put: probably the most exciting gaming experience I have ever had. I can't, in full honesty, give to this game less than the higher vote I have ever awarded to a game, so far


[Oct, 14th game]: after so many games and months there are still big big surprises. The WOW factor is often still impressive, probably also because we never played any Pandemic expansion. Anyways, the storyline behind is very good.

[Jan, 1st game]: what a great game! I don't remember many games that could give me so many strong emotions! I dunno if it deserves the first spot but PL surely manages to give you an incredibly exciting time!

Only complaint: the very first time we didn't read correctly the first cards and decided to replay it because we basically played the first time as a warming game. We all agreed that the text on the STOP card is NOT as clear as it should be. Anyways, we managed not to ruin anything and we still enjoyed our true first game of January, losing it miserably :)
Great surprises already in the first month!

I’ve been itching to break out Pandemic Legacy since I’ve been hearing so many good things from many reviewers. I can say that they weren’t wrong. You’re still playing vanilla Pandemic to some degree, but pretty quickly your objective changes and the situation is not what you’re expecting. The game does a good job of taking a pretty boring game system and making each game of it novel and different. It’s the difference between reading a book that you’re having a hard time finishing (Pandemic) and a book where you want to read just one more chapter (Pandemic Legacy).

However, should this game be the number one game on BoardGameGeek? Well, it’s not mine, but I am happy that Twilight Struggle isn’t number one anymore. It’s a fantastic game, that’s for sure, but it’s also a three hour, two-player, political, card driven war game, not something I’d want someone new to the hobby jumping into.

RATING: 9
This game was awesome! I already fell in love with Pandemic (especially the In The Lab expansion) and I was so stoked that the legacy version was set to come out on my birthday. So, of course, I had to get it.

My wife and I played the game through in only 4 days. We definitely binge-played one Saturday for like 8 hours. The game kept us hooked as to what would happen next.

At first we were both hesitant about making permanent changes to the game, never having played a legacy game before. But we found that it was exhilarating to know that the actions our characters took and the decisions we made had lasting effect in the game.

Overall, the storyline of the game was intriguing and kept us immensely interested in what new challenges lie ahead. Even developing a strategy was something we could do differently almost every month of the game.

The only reason I would not give this game a 10 is due to how it ended. Since we are only able to play this game once through, I wish the ending would have been more satisfying. It's like when your favorite TV show is unfolding in such an amazing way and then suddenly it ends, introducing a brand new element that seems only vaguely related to what has happened so far.

The point system unveiled at the end to determine how well your team did in saving the world was a real bummer. If you somehow miss out on one of the last two objectives in the very last month (December), your score is greatly impacted. (This is what happened to us). Also, had we known that what we were doing would have certain point values attached, we would have pursued objectives differently with known priorities. I am sad that there is a way to end this game without definitive closure (call it a personality thing) on whether you won or lost. Based on what our board looks like, I think we should have won, but the point system told us that it was a work in progress, which totally left us hanging without a sense of defeat or satisfaction in victory. It was just blah. It's over.

Don't get me wrong. We had tons of fun throughout the whole time we were playing. However, when something so good has a poor ending, it kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth. I hope that when Season 2 comes out, they adjust something in regards to how it ends and how your team wins or loses overall. I would happy to provide suggestions.

RATING: 9
We played a 2 player game over two weekends and finished with 10 wins and 7 loses.

Was a unique experience which we enjoyed.

Could not give it a higher score due to lack of re-playability. Also games that I have rated higher we enjoy more generally speaking. They also come the additional bonus of being able to be played over and over again.

I would not rate vanilla pandemic more than an 8 (have it on the iPad), so the legacy tacked on experience does help push the score to a 9.

Will definitely be interested in playing season 2 when it comes out, but I see no point in keeping season 1 my self.

This is good, depending on how much you want to play Pandemic over and over again. I got tired of the core concept of play a (modified) game of Pandemic before the legacy elements lost their appeal. Had I not played my fill of generic Pandemic before starting the legacy version, I might have liked it more. As it stands, I think the base experience is only barely deep and interesting enough to support as many plays as the legacy implementation requires. Rating is higher than it would be otherwise for it being on the vanguard of legacy design space exploration.

Right. I wasn't really a fan of the orginal Pandemic in the first place (or coops in general, for that matter). This one is slightly better than the original, but why it holds the #1 spot here on BGG is a total mystery to me. Me and 3 friends split the money to buy a copy and we're almost halfway through the campaign. I'm hoping it'll get at least slightly better because I'm just not feeling it and quite frankly, at this point I just wanna plow through and be done with it.

Best tabletop gaming experience ever. Brilliant and unexpected story turns--in retrospect we should have predicted but it is much more fun to just let the story happen to us. Brilliant inclusion of various tactile reveal experiences when it was time to add something new. Love the feeling of sacrelige from defacing the game (which we soon got over and relished with childish joy). A handful of jaw dropping moments. The looks on our faces was priceless. The importance of each action.  Total commitment, total respect and focus. No one wanted to let the team down. We felt sick as a personal failure for each outbreak, each riot, each infected city. What a profound moment when you realize you are actually considering sacrifices of segments of the population for the safety of the rest of humankind. The only minuscule distraction was the other player quarterbacking at times but that was mostly from dramatic moments with everyone fully engaged. I can't think of another game that has brought a group of friends together to share such a special experience. The only thing that comes close was the first years of Magic.

One of the finest boardgames even contrived by the likes of humankind. We were absolutely engaged during every game of the year and would routinely play back-to-back. So unique and so well designed and playtested. I have no idea how ZMAN can manage that with a permanently changing landscape, but they did it. Only thing to be warned about is that there are tons of rules and then, as you play, there are more. Having someone come in for a "cameo" that hasn't played from the beginning is really tough for them. Best to get your group lined up and stick with those folks the whole time. Work of art!

Brilliant from beginning to end. It tricked us into thinking it would be too simple, then proceeded to get crazy hard, even out, and throw in countless twists and conundrums throughout. So many choices, and unique plots makes it highly unlikely we can play again, as knowing how it turns out does effectively ruin the gameplay. Such as knowing "paramilitary" perk will effectively kill that character permanently, means we wouldn't put it on any character. 

But still. It was amazing. And we never opened box 8.

The experience with this game is just fantastic. For most of the game, the tension is really high. There are lots of surprises, and you always think the next game will be soo easy, until it changes again. 

It feels like there is somewhat more luck involved than in regular Pandemic, but that's fine I guess. The storytelling is great, the new characters and upgrades too. I am really looking forward to season 2. 

Spoiler alert: why I don't grade it higher is because there wasn't enough variety with the missions and that the mid-game didn't have a high enough tempo. But it still is one of the best games I have ever played.

At the halfway mark (mid-June), the future is dark.  We've only won 4 of 9 games, and we're a single loss away from having to open package #8, the pity package for four-time losers.  The red sector is an oozing carbuncle that's fading into the twilight, with a torched research station acting as a beacon of failure and most red cities at panic levels two, three, or four.

Suicidal thoughts notwithstanding, the game has been great.  We've been willing to play as many as three games in a row, which would never happen with the original.  The Legacy aspects are top-notch, though occasionally overwhelming to track.  Particularly the new rules, which require a quick review before every session.

Our initial thought was to play two games per night every two weeks, but life's intrusions pushed that plan aside.  Now we're stuck playing once per month - though still two games at a time - which has interrupted our momentum and made it difficult to re-immerse ourselves in the experience.

I'm still extremely happy with our decision to only play four-player games, and always with the same people. That vow will never be broken, which has significantly enriched the experience for all of us.  Swapping people in and out of the campaign would be a real drag, for a multitude of reasons.

A tip for new players: The order of set-up is significantly different for Legacy than for the original.  The board is first seeded with disease cubes, then events are chosen, and then finally the characters and starting location are selected.  That's important.

Finally, for those worried about game disposability...

I'm guessing that we'll need to play ~18 games to finish the full campaign (i.e., we'll fail every other month and need to repeat those months).  I've probably only played 10% of my games 18+ times, so this actually makes Pandemic Legacy one of the most cost-effective purchases in my collection.

[i]Update:[/i]

We finished the campaign (Sep-Dec) in a marathon six-hour session at the 2016 WBC in its new Seven Springs location.  Absolutely fantastic game, but we screwed up badly by forgetting to open window #30 until it was far too late, which we only realized when the legacy game components started referring to terms and concepts that we'd never heard of.  By then, it was mathematically impossible to win the final month and all of our efforts had gone to naught.  :(

Final score: 442, which is surely an all-time record in the wrong direction.  21 total games played.  We did OK in the beginning, terrible in the middle, and very well at the end.  Until we hit a disastrous December.

As far as campaign stumbles go, one of my fellow disease-fighters said it best:  It's like each month introduced a brand new expansion, making it impossible to keep everything straight.  We regularly made rules errors that affected the game, although we did the best we could under the circumstances.

Still, I loved the experience and am anxiously awaiting Season 2.  We were never forced to open package #8, despite a deluge of fallen red cities. It's just too bad that there was so much pressure to get all of the new rules correct the first time through, since there were no opportunities for rewinding time to fix misunderstandings or unintentional omissions.

Updating rating to a 9.9 after a couple dozen plays (on two copies). I don't want to keep playing the same copy after the campaign is finished, which keeps it from being a perfect 10, but I'm happy to play a whole new compaign.

I find the Legacy concept exciting and the execution is great. The choices that have to be made at the start and end of each game really add a whole layer to each play.

Phenomenal game in every aspect.  The reveals, the permanents, and the gameplay are all captivating.   Recommended for all gamers, and highly recommended for anyone who enjoys Pandemic.

Just one caveat, which is the only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10: Make sure you go into this with a group of 3-4 people who can get together to game *at least twice a month*.  Ideally, play this with roommates who you can play with multiple days a week.  We made the mistake of going into this with a group that only gets together once every 2-4 months, and it is very difficult to get back into the swing of things each time, refreshing ourselves on all of the changing rules, etc.  It's best to knock out the entire game (12-24 games played) in less than a month if you can.

No Spoilers Included in Comments Below!

Received as an Early Birthday Gift in Spring 2017. My wife and I played through the campaign with another couple from Mid-April through Mid-September, so it took a few months.

Overall, I've rated Legacy an 8.5. The overall storyline was intriguing, with a couple of "no-way-that-just-happened" moments that was quite entertaining to us all.

Sure, after 16 Games (for us) it's over, and we won't be playing it again. But it was a ton of fun. Enough so that we'll likely pick up Season II sometime this Fall/Winter. A very enjoyable experience, and for the $35 we paid for it (on sale), it was worth every penny.

We are onto May now in our campaign and we've had a lot of fun with it. The game is really starting to change. One thing that was hard for us was remembering all the orginail rules and then adding new rules in each game and trying not to have to reference the rule book every 5 minutes. I think it took us 4 games before we can say for certain we played all the rules correctly.

Absolutely amazing experience from start to finish. We'd played a ton of Pandemic when we first started hobby boardgaming, but burnt out and hadn't touched it in years.

I like Pandemic, and at first this version really increased the tension because of the permanent effects. Players are a lot more emerged. Was very enthusiastic after the first few games, but later on the setup became more fiddly. 

Then we figured out we had made some major rule mistakes. The most important one was just something we overlooked in the rules, but others were due to weirdly worded texts on cards, or got lost in the deluge of small rule additions, and translation errors that plague the Dutch version. 

In the end, we were disappointed with the overal experience. Though we had some great new experiences, the last few games felt more like chores with the longer setup and additional rules to keep track off. And most of those rules did not add a lot of the experience of the game.

RATING: 2
Legacy adds elements that make Pandemic way too fiddly and is more about using stickers to reduce bookkeeping between games.  I'm not convinced the Legacy treatment is the better version of this game mechanically, and it feels noticeably easier.  The game sort of happens to you and choices don't matter in the grand scheme of things.

The biggest letdown is the "theme" and story.  We couldn't pull ourselves to finish the season, though we committed to playing through July.  PL's story reminds me of every popular serialized drama on TV - falling into the same tired tropes with no reason to stay engaged.  The big "reveal" was met with tired groans and the rolling of eyes.

Good game, but we never finished the campaign. Once we had a tactic running, there was no way other characters would have made a positive difference. Every month felt the same plus one new small thing popping up.

Good game, but I like regular Pandemic better. There are some game months that I found quite boring and I felt a bit sour having to go through those. Those segments distracted too much from what I like to do in Pandemic: running around saving the world by curing diseases. I loved the first half of the game, but the 3 quarter fell really flat for me. After the plot twist, the game grabbed my attention again and I like the finish.

Still, I would rather advice people to take a look at vanilla Pandemic then Legacy season 1. The primary reason behind this, is that for Pandemic Legacy you very likely want to play the whole game through with the same people, which can become a hassle. With vanilla Pandemic, you can always drop down a game to play with anyone.

When it comes to recommendations, here are mine:
1. Most important: make sure you can get the same people to play the game with you on a regular basis.
2. If you intend to play with 2 players, have everybody play 2 characters instead of one. Having each player play a single character makes the game significantly easier and it'll cut some content away.

"It's over. It's finally over." This is probably my most love hate game experience ever. My first legacy, but not my first one-time-play game (Time Stories and Unlock).

From the beginning I was in love with it, "it's Pandemic but with a story! and I can rip things apart!" Later on, it got a bit repetitive, but still, overall I liked it a lot.

The the very last game we discovered that we played one rule wrong, throughout the whole thing, not in our favour!! And we lost that game (December, 2 try) by one turn! We just restarted it and won the (out of the rules) third game. We felt the need for it!

Now I have a conflict in my head: What shall I rate Pandemic Legacy, considering that I gave 8.5 to Pandemic?! Sure, they are different games, but they are also very similar. And that duality is what makes is complicated. In one way, "it's Pandemic, but with more!" in another "it's just Pandemic, with more".

Edit 26-06-17: I gave it 8 (0.5 less than regular Pandemic). In the end it was for sure a memorable experience.

Edit 31-07-17: I now lowered my rating of Pandemic to 8, but I'll leave Legacy at 8 also, since the system and the "wow" moments make it this good.

I would never play this again but I am merely forced by my ever so lovely boyfriend for some god awful reason to fill up space as an extra body to be the fucking medic. I was a medic in real life so you'd think I'd be great as a medic in this game but my boyfriend and his friend make all the decisions. I hope the diseases ravish us all so I don't have to play this anymore.

I enjoyed the game quite a bit as well as my parents.  I was concerned that the game might be too complex to be enjoyable for them, but it has been ok so far.

I really enjoy the surprises (opening doors like an Advent calendar, component boxes, etc), making it a much different experience than Pandemic.

Okay, I finished the campaign with my friends, 20 games. What an experience. Yeah, I can't see getting two copies though. Once you go through the story, it sticks with you. I am looking forward to season two and this was easily game of the year. The obvious complaint is the limited replay-ability. However, the experience was one of the best I've ever had. Literally every game night I had after buying this while we hadn't beaten it yet was everyone being on the same page of "Let's play it.... twice"

Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.

It's Pandemic so it's already going to be great. The legacy system will probably never find a better game to take on than this one. We're only a couple months in but I can already tell this game will be something I never forget. I scoff at those complaining about the "limited" number of playthroughs. I only own a few games that I've played more than I'll end up playing this one and most of those I've grown a bit tired of. Even if you are a person who plays a game hundreds of times the value for money here is still incredible. An $80 game that plays an average of 16 times is a $5 per play experience that has incredible story telling and is a once in a lifetime type experience. There may be a lot of games in any one persons collection with even better value to money than this but it doesn't invalidate the bargain you are getting.

The two of us burned through this one like it was a Netflix series. I found it really entertaining but I'm not throwing "game of the year" laurels at it. The legacy elements are interesting but people tend to over-egg the quality of the story which I thought was serviceable but nothing really original or special. The feeling was not really one of immersion into a story but more of playing Pandemic with ephemeral expansion content. Now that it is done I have little desire to play it again, I wouldn't get another season 1 box. 

< October 2015 > chucked the box out April 2017 after salvaging it part parts to use in  regular pandemic/ other games

It's Pandemic, with most of all the expansion stuff turned on during a linear campaign system, with a linear storyline, with some plot twists, with permanent rules changes/new components/component destruction... really cool way to play Pandemic... one play through was enough for me, but you could play it 2 or 3 times with fresh games/gamers just for the experience of trying to score better while not giving away the surprises to new players...

Really great experience for my game group. I'm normally overcautious when it comes to my games, although I slowly try to stop worrying about it so much. So I was pretty surprised when I found that ripping cards apart can be quite the satisfying feeling.
It is great seeing the game evolve and having a part in that. We really enjoyed it up until now and I definitely think that the money was worth it, even though it's just a "one time" experience. We already made some pretty great memories. We're not finished yet so it's possible that the rating might change, but I'm so in love with this game right now.

Legacy might be the best game I've ever played. I'm okay with the lack of replayability because the experience of beating it was incredible. We made so many memories.

If there's an issue here, it's the pure level of chaos. You have to keep track of dozens and dozens of papers, rule changes, characters, and exceptions at one time. We definitely screwed up some rules; a few of these mistakes made the game much harder, and a few of them made the game much easier. We also got unbelievably lucky in 3 or 4 straight games. January through April killed us, but we coasted through the rest.

Such an exciting game, and so tense! Every month brings something new to the table and changes the game in some subtle and some not-so-subtle ways, but Pandemic Legacy is always a blast! I want multiple copies just to share with all of my different groups of friends! This game is beautiful.

I really enjoyed the game because I love Legacy games but I was a little disappointed.  Story line is too linear because the hidden content gets flipped in order and is pushed more by how many games have been played than anything else.  Something like Risk Legacy that unlocks happened more often from events that could happen at anytime I felt was much more interesting.

I feel the first half of the game was more thought out than the end.  Felt like it started dragging on a bit at the end and evolved a bit less.

All that being said it is one of my favorite games because a disappointing Legacy game is better than most other games.  Leaves you wanting more and slowly builds complexity.

[Update:  I bumped down my rating on this a half a point for re-playability.  I own multiple copies doing multiple campaign's and after finishing the first campaign I don't find myself excited to play more because it is so story line.  Risk Legacy I still would play any day and still think about playing years later.  This is great for one time through but loses its magic after the last game for me.]

Have now played this with two separate groups. The first, a 4-player group, the second a different 5-player group. Both enjoyed it immensely and we are now eagerly awaiting Season 2, due in mid-2017. 

Although the game states it plays 2-4 it plays 5 no problem with a couple of house-rules that I've documented under the Pandemic Legacy pages. 

The way the game unfolds is brilliant and there were only a couple of items we found a bit too theatrical/Hollywood and therefore distracting, but not so much so that it detracted from game play.

Having now played through twice we're all up for a bit of a rest until Season 2 drops :-).

Első 3 játék: Áhhh, nincsenek szavak. Zseniálisan vitték tovább az előd gyökereit, az alapokat megtartva, de mégis annyi újítással, hogy minden vele töltött percét megéri, még akkor is, ha már 100+ alkalom van a sima Pandemicben.
---
+4 játék: Tovább tudták fokozni a dolgot. Megint bejött pár újdonság, ami nagyon illik a játékba és teljesen megváltoztat mindent. Ja, és megvolt az első kártyatépés is. :)

+3 játék: Oké, nyilván történt megint egy olyan dolog, h hűha, csak fogtuk a fejünket. Továbbra is nagyon izgalmas, nagyon jó, simán hozza egy körömrágósan izgalmas hollywoodi film hangulatát.
---
Utolsó 3 játék+összegzés: További meglepetések a végére, viszont katarzis nincs a legvégén. Itt igaz, h nem a cél a fontos, hanem a megtett út. Minden egyes perce maga az élvezet, a nagybetűs társasjáték ez. 
-------------------------------------------
Egy évvel később újra elővettük, immáron a magyar változatot. Továbbra is fantasztikus élmény, még ha a főbb csavarokra emlékszem is. Ez továbbra is egy páratlan társasjáték!

As opposed to Risk: Legacy, which I found to be Rogue-Like (Some clan development and world alterations). It ends up being an adventure that changes very little with no definitive end.

Pandemic Legacy is more like a TV show. Forcing you to play only two games in a month shuffles you through the narrative the authors have planned out. Interesting in that you can fail at the end of the game.

Un collaborativo molto interessante in questa versione Legacy dobbiamo applicare anche i "danni" sulla plancia.

It is a fantastic game I have ever played. It is not just a board game.

The good : game gives you new small gameplay elements to play with, therefore every session stayed fresh and offered something new to do, a bit of character progression, game balance was preserved throughout game 

The mediocre : the story 

The bad : the aweful dutch translation full of critical errors

Does the game deserve spot 1 ? Nope totally not , it's good and would recommend to play it but it didn't feel fantastic, grand nor innovative, just good.

Definitely put in a 6th epidemic if you're an experienced Pandemic group. It's got less cool reveals than I expected, kinda thought they'd do more with it, but maybe that's an effect of having played Pandemic + On the Brink a bunch. It is a little addictive wanting to see what happens next.
=============
UPDATE: Just finished, overall a neat experience. One of the mechanics introduced later didn't excite us that much, but things got harder as the game progressed which made it fun to deal with, burning through various powers and options to squeak in the win. In the end we used a 6th epidemic in 4 of the games (starting roughly half-way through), as a step up from zero funding. But in the last few months we lost a few games so it was back down to 5 epidemics.

Hard to rate. Hard to compare with other games I've given a 10, like Galaxy Trucker, Cosmic Encounter, and Netrunner, where I've played 100's of games and they still hold up to the test of time. On the other hand, I think the quality of the experience is just as good, and in some ways better than those games.

It's not flawless, but I'd probably rate it a 10 if it were more replayable. As it is, I'll dock it a point for it having a static ending while still highly recommending.

An ok game, fun for kids. It's interesting to try to judge on the fly by three different qualities, but ultimately one person ends up winning by a card or three. A good quick diversion, but I'm not sure that it will hold up for adults.

It's essentially real-time Uno with 1-5, about 6 colors and shapes.  Match number, color or shape on one of the two face up cards.  It heavily favors people who can quickly see a potential match and play it.  After playing a few games with my kids, I started to see how the order of finish didn't change much.  Unless you are playing with players of comparable ability to process information and act quickly, this game will not be that fun or challenging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Games are fast and fun for the kids.  They will play this most anytime.  
It says it's for 2 players, but we play 3 player all the time.  It's clearly a very light game, so it plays well with 3 piles.

A cross betweens a video game, a board game and playing sport. It test hand-eye coordination and pattern recogition. Fast quick fun, kids will love it as it is not a deep thinking game. You can improve in the game by repeated plays. If you like tetris - the video game, you will like this game. Ideal for kids and wife. Actually, I am having more fun watching others playing than playing it myself because I bomb in this game ;-)

The rulebook claims that some players can finish a game of Blink in under thirty seconds. I certainly hope they wear earplugs, because those cards are probably moving quickly enough to break the sound barrier.

If you have butter fingers, you are colorblind, cannot count to five, or you're one of those people that take inordinately long turns no matter what game you're playing, this game is probably a poor fit for you. Otherwise, next to "the game where you try to step on the other person's foot before they can step on yours", it's my favorite two-player dexterity game.

i wanted to trade this one away, but since i started playing brain age on the nintendo ds i've developed a newfound interest in mental games.  this game would be terrible with players that aren't equally matched though.  update: i never actually played it despite this alleged interest, traded away!

A fun little filler game of slapping cards down. If you can get in a groove, it's great. If you can't, it's frustrating, but what the hell, it's over quickly. UPDATE: Possibly my quickest dime [i]ever[/i]. Plus, the three-player rules work just as well.

Back in the daze of high school and junior high, I passed many (and I mean MANY) an afternoon playing regular ole Speed.  This is a *great* little repackaging of that game, and it keeps you on your toes, trying to figure out matching color vs shape vs number.  Blink and you'll lose!  Awesome less-than-2-minute competitive card game.

Blink does what it tries to do, nothing less and nothing more. There are dozens of fast hand pattern-matching games out there now, but as far as I know this was one of the first. It's not going to blow anyone's mind, but every collection should have a game like Blink. It would have scored higher back when it was released, but now the 'formula' has been expanded and improved upon in other fast hand games such as Collide-O and 7ATE9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It is a combination of UNO and Speed. You try to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. You have to lay down a card on top of another card that matches either the shape shown, the color of the shape or the number of shapes shown. Winner is the first person to get rid of their cards.

Great game to play with the kids.  Empty your deck as fast as you can.  What a rush!  Over very quickly, and guarantees at least one player asking, "One more time?"

However I'm not big on speed games, so this comes out only if I'm coaxed.

Good quick game.  Fun to play with kids - you can handicap it by giving yourself more cards.  I play with my 5yo and give her 25 cards to my 35...and I can play my "best" and the games are always pretty close.  As she gets older & better we'll lower the handicap.  Great for playing 3 times in a row, and it still only takes like 10 minutes!

The objective in this game is to get rid of your hand of cards before your opponent. You play your cards on the discard piles, one by one, if they match one of the following characteristics on the top-most discarded card: color, type of card symbol, number of card symbols.

A round of Blink plays in about a minute. Good for what it is.

Locke got this game from his boardgame design classes he was in, during the summer, and it is quite a fun game, in the vein of Set.  Play cards that have a single characteristic as cards on the table.  Be the first to empty your hand and deck to win the round. I can pretend to be stuck to let him catch up, but I didn't need to do this much.  I like this as a change from Uno.

It is fun. It engages the mind.

However, it is so short, and not a game sufficiently interesting that I'll play ten games in a row, that I never suggest it. I just never suggest games that I'm going to play, grand total, for less than ten minutes.

For a speed pattern recognition game, I'll choose Set over this. As a bonus, Set easily handles more players as well.

Quick, fast-paced reaction game.  I am actually better at this one than some other speed-based games, so it is kind of fun for me.

EDIT: 08/05/16 - Eight years later, and I don't age very well.  I have gotten worse and speed-based games, and no longer enjoy playing them.  The good thing is, my family doesn't like to play them any more either.  That's fine by me.

RATING: 4
A little bit like Set, but has simultaneous cardplay.  It's very chaotic, as each person plays cards as quickly as they can from their hands.  Draw, match, play.  I think, for pattern matching, Set is probably better as everyone is competing over the same puzzle, so it's easier to tell what's going on.

7 yr. old loves it - good for a quick game or two before dinner.  Color/Shape/Number recognition speed game, one reason I like it is that it forces the kids to pay close attention and to focus on the game (sometimes an issue with my 7 yr. old, but to my great joy, gaming seems to be helping with this).  I like the idea of another reviewer that whomever wins one round, that person gets extra cards in the next round equal in number to what the loser had left in their hand.  Will have to try this.  Easy to handicap with kids - just give them a smaller portion of the deck.

Simple and easy to learn.  Match colors, shapes and numbers.  The variations for the 3-4 players is a nice change as well.  And each game is a really short game.  The trick is finding the people who are at the same level as you.  If you are too fast it becomes difficult for people to stay interested, if you are too slow then you can become very frustrated very easily.

This game can be difficult for color blind people.

Another game that reminds me of the card game Speed. What I really like about Blink is that there are three things to focus on, color, number of icons, and shape. If any match, you can play. I do enjoy this game, but it's another game that falls victim to "I don't have anybody to play this with me." I think this falls in between Speed (simpler) and Jab: Realtime Boxing (more complex/involved) to me. I would still enjoy playing this if people would play me. I like speed card games.

This is much like the card game Speed. Divvy up the deck between the players (for 2) or among the players (for 3), and race to get rid of your draw pile first. Match shapes, colors, or number of symbols to get rid of cards. That's it.

The entire thing plays in under 2 minutes, so there isn't much strategy. But I have a soft spot for real-time "speed games" (Dutch Blitz, Chopstick Dexterity MegaChallenge 3000, Jungle Speed, Brawl) and this fits right along with the others. I wouldn't ever play two of these games back-to-back, but they're quite enjoyable nonetheless.

An advanced form of Spit - if you've ever played that game with playing cards.  Instead of just matching numbers, Blink adds shapes and colors in addition to numbers.  Speed games are NOT my strength, so I play this when I've been winning too many games recently to guarantee my wife a win (or we play Dutch Blitz...which is another game where she stomps me).

Relatively mindless, but a fast and fun filler that can be played by even young children. For those familiar with neuropsychological testing, this is like the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task on amphetamine - players match cards with either of two reference stacks on the basis of shape, color, or number. Players go simultaneously, moving as fast as they can; the first player to deplete their deck of cards wins!

First played December 19th, 2007. Taught in 2 minutes and takes less than that to play make it a great filler for that timeframe. There are 60 cards with 1-5 colors, shapes and objects on each to make up the deck. In a two player game you are each dealt 30 cards and have a hand of three cards. You each flip over your top card and can play a valid card on either card. A valid play is a card from your hand that matches eith your card or your opponents card color, shape or number of objects on each. After playing a card, you must draw a card. First one to exhaust your deck and hand, wins. In a three player game, each are dealt 20 cards and then sit in a triangle. Place your face up card to your left between (between you and the person on your left). Each player my only play to the card face up on their left or right. It's fun enough to play for those who know someone who has it however I wouldn't rush out to buy it.

The best 2-player game with young kids (say, 6-8).  One of mine almost fell out of her chair laughing when we first played this.

Portable and plays mindnumbingly fast.

My wife and I love speed games, and this one is a lot of fun.  What's good about this one is that there are so many ways to place your card on one of the piles.  When it only has to match in color, shape or number, you very rarely get stuck and the game flies by, usually in less than a minute.  The one problem I could see with this is that it's impossible to tell if your opponent is cheating.  But I guess if one is going to cheat in a little 1 minute filler game, why are even play in the first place?  One other caveat: I wonder about the durability of the cards.  Even in the few plays we've had, the cards will take a beating due to the nature of the game.  I guess I may eventually need a backup copy.

Pretty fun for a quick game.  It's like playing "speed" with face cards, except you've got symbols, colors, and counts to pay attention to.  It's kind of fun to try and make your brain switch gears really quick from looking at one attribute to another.

Blink, a fast paced two player card game played in under two minutes.  It is a simple game, easy to learn, without an abundance of strategy, but with high-levels of quick thinking and dexterity.  It can be fun to play but only if you find a contender around the same abilities as yourself.  You may play a few games in a row but then move on to bigger and better things.

Another Tanga mystery game. This was a hit with the wife. We had a lot of fun playing this game.

6.24.09

The fun level for this one is in line with Target.

There is always some good natured fun - a bit like slap jack for grown ups ( although Karen and I used to play slap jack even in college - her reflexes were sooo much better than mine it wasn't much of a competition, but it was fun. )

7.7.09 Dropped rating to a 6. The game is good, just not wildly compelling. It is fun for a laugh every now and again.

Game in a Nutshell: Speed-based game where you match different colors, shapes and numbers to get rid of your cards first.

Played as: 2 player

Pros: Takes the adrenaline pumping card game of speed and makes a game where you have to not only be quick with your recognition and hands, but also quick at switching your brain from left to right to left again.

Cons: It's still just a game of speed. How well you do will probably be determined before you even start: how much sleep you had, what else is on your mind, or even if you really care. Or you could just get a crappy string of cards you can't play.

Other: This is still the best game of speed I've played, it's just that I never particularly loved speed.

Best Use: You like Speed but want it taken to a higher level.

Plays for Blink represent sessions, not individual plays, as games move so quickly.

Blink is essentially the standard card game speed, but it adds the extra dimension of being able to play on suit, color, or number. It is incredibly fast (as fast as 30 seconds in some cases) and chaotic. The first to deplete their 30 card stack into the two central discard piles is the winner, no more, no less. It's good filler but grows stale quickly.

Fast time-filler.  Similar thought process to spotting the easy (same type) groupings in Set: ie "not much thought".  The speed aspect saves the game as occasionally your opponent will slip a card in just before you do.  Undemanding and good to play with kids. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Crazy fast card game of matching shapes, colors, and groups in a game of speed!  No downtime except when you are slow or stuck...which means you just lost when playing against a fast player (like my wife). Not very good at it, but anyone can play, loose, and have a good time!

This game is so quick, I'll happily play it anytime.  Literally takes just a few seconds - maybe a minute.  Blink and you miss it.  Not terribly deep but a nice little filler / time waster.

The rulebook claims that some players can finish a game of Blink in under thirty seconds. I certainly hope they wear earplugs, because those cards are probably moving quickly enough to break the sound barrier.

If you have butter fingers, you are colorblind, cannot count to five, or you're one of those people that takes inordinately long turns no matter what game you're playing, this game is probably a poor fit for you. Otherwise, next to "the game where you try to step on the other person's foot before they can step on yours", it's my favorite two-player game.

Fast and fun.  Easy to handicap for kids (play one round, see who wins by how much, then give that player roughly that many more cards the next round).

Another good pick for pre-literate/pre-numerate kids, but it's enough fun that I'd play it with another adult.

Great game to play with the kids.  It's super short, so if one of our kids is sad or something, you can cheer them up with a quick game.

This is a great little game. It takes longer to setup than play and the card stock is awful. However, I have played this with 3 people and it's also easy to create your own variants. I give my 5 year old daughter 20 (give or take a few) cards and I'm left with 40. I can play as fast as I want and it's still very challenging ( I usually lose). My 4 year old plays this and it's been helpful for his counting, colors, and general thinking.

Blink fills the fast, fun, and portable niche perfectly. It's small enough to throw in a pocket or purse to entertain the kids while waiting somewhere, and it's easy to handicap for different skill levels.

My favorite use of it is as a quick way to "wake up" my daughter's brain before school, as it gets her engaged and excited even when she's been dragging all morning.

[Adlung 'Speed' 2000 edition] {Kid, filler; perception, real time} Speed is an extremely simple and exciting card game. It is the fastest game I have. Players compete to be the first played all cards of their deck by matching patterns of cards on the table. It's equally cheerful when you are playing or watching a duel. Although it's cheerful, it's only good when playing occasionally because every game is similar.

Speed only requires single level of pattern-matching skill. Players need not rotate / flip / rearrange the cards. It's easy to distinguish each attribute: color, shape and number of icons. There is no random factor and it's only a 2p game. Thus, it's easy to have a sure winner in Speed; who reacts and thinks fast usually wins. To have more fun, one shall find an equally fast player.  In case the skill of players is very different, handicap can be used (though I don't think it's fun anymore).
Sometimes, you can disturb the flow of your opponents by motions, talking, etc. :laugh: :devil:

I haven't tried a 3p game yet but I will find a chance to try it.

If you want to kill 5-10 minutes with a short easy game, this is it. In fact an average round lasts barely 3 minutes. They consider that the game, but it makes more sense to play in rounds with best 2 out of 3 or something like that.

Sort of a speed version of Set, but more frantic than headache-making.  Fun and fast.  Almost takes more time to shuffle and deal than to play.  Worth the price.  See my review:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/1160448#1160448

Its the old standby - Speed, but with a custom deck that is shapes, groups of 1-5 and colors. If you aren't familiar with Speed - its a game where you have a small hand and attempt to discard the cards by matching one of two piles - thus the matching criteria are nearly always changing. It takes both mental wit and a bit of dexterity and thus makes a great kids game for the 5-8 range (though I'm sure folks older probably still enjoy this too). Most games take almost no time at all.

I've stopped recording plays of this - I play it too much with my kids to pay attention.

You've probably played a real-time Speed-esque card game before, so you almost certainly already know whether or not you'll enjoy this one. Personally, once we break it out it's hard not to play 10-20 rounds of it. Should probably invest in an extra deck or two to make sure it sticks around in the collection forever, the cards are of nice quality but certain aggressive players may have a tendency to slam into them and cause moderate bending. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's like a two-player version of Dutch Blitz!

...except it sucks.

You've got three cards in your hand, and you play those cards, in real time, into two different piles. There are some limitations about how you play the cards, but you can usually just play your whole hand onto one pile, so this ends up being about who can draw three cards and then play three cards the fastest.

Sold.

Blink is all about pattern recognition and speed! I like these kinds of speed games, like Slapjack and Egyptian Rat. With Blink you spend more time shuffling and dealing the deck at the beginning than you do playing the game! You can play best 2 of 3 in under 5 minutes and feel like you got a great game, though I usually prefer to do best 3 of 5.

RATING: 7
This is pretty much a rip-off of the card game known as Spit or Speed.  Instead of the 1 up / 1 down you get with Speed, this game utilizes shapes, colors, and numbers.  Each player starts with an equal number of cards in their pile and can hold 5 at any one time.  Each player flips over the top card of their pile.  Cards from the hand are played on any of these cards that are in play.  All that is required is that the shape, color, or # of shapes on a card matches one in play.  The first player to complete exhaust their pile is the winner.

One thing I don't like in comparison to Speed, is that it is really hard to anticipate what a player is going to do. In Speed, I sometimes go for the psyche to disrupt my opponent -- waiting until the last second to lay down a card to foul them up.  With this game, that is not as easy to do.

a great, fast and furious time with kids.  I am a teacher, and this game gets played more than any at school.  It takes three minutes, and builds spacial awareness.....

the deal is everyone has a stack of cards of their own, and you hold three in your hand at all times, replenishing when necessary.  on the table are two cards....they might have 4 blue stars on them.....or 2 red moons. you can put down a card if you can match color, number of things, or shape.  So you and your opponent are racing through your cards.

simple fun good

After 20+ Plays: This game is crazy fast.  I find it very hard to look for 3 characteristics at one time (#, shape, and color).  I find that I unconciously stop looking at one of the three, so sometimes I think I'm stuck, but it just takes a second to find a match.  Very fast, but it's not mindlessly throwing down cards like you might think.

A great game to play in less time than it takes to boil an egg. I've played it with a deck of cards before, but the custom deck streamlines play, which was my quibble in a standard deck version.

I think it would get old after 20-ish plays, but that doesn't negate the fact that it is an extremely fun filler.

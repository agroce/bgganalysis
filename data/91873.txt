1 play / 5 players

LIKE: A simple game, interesting blend of mechanism. The auctions using limited cards is tense and tactical. The rhythm of choosing the selling and buying actions were well designed. 
DISLIKE: Dry theme: traders in the medieval times. Probably best at 4,5 players, especially since the sell actions are more plentiful at lower player counts. The bidding tiles should be different at different player counts (I'm guessing).

OVERALL: I was surprised that this is a pretty good auction game, and flowed smoothly. If it would get an theme update, I think it would be a great gateway game.

Pretty decent game about card rationing and bluffing.  Fun planning and tense play with the task cards.

RATING: 8
+ Quick, meaningful auctions with tiered benefits; Visually appealing; Planning the use of your deck over 5 rounds gives you extra control.
- If you aren't into auctions, there isn't really anything else to find in this game.


Why it's previously-owned:
This is a super solid game that I very much enjoy playing.  But the theme is such that I would probably never suggest playing it when there are other super solid games based around interesting themes.
This got traded as part of a big online trade.

rule reminder:
1. meeples in the guild are not removed after a turn. They stay there until they are removed by someone else winning an auction for that specific guild
2. bidding is done one-by-one: start player reveals cards, then the second player can decide if he wants to bid. if so, he reveals cards. then the next player goes, etc.

1st play: I had played this before years ago (before I started tracking plays) and I remember not being fond of it.  Playing it again didn't move it up for me.  I didn't really like picking goals with no real information, although with repeat plays that probably wouldn't be a problem.  Turn order plays such a huge important role in this game and the money track is just a bit too tight.  It's meant to play in a short timeframe, so it doesn't overstay it's welcome.  I don't like knowing that I'm out of it 3 rounds in, and having to play it out but that's how this felt.

I enjoy auction games and Strasbourg gives me 35 auctions and a novel mechanic for creating bids.  What's not to like?

Each player has an identical deck of just 24 cards of values 1 to 6.  They draw as many cards as they wish to bid with in each round and then divide those cards according to the number of bids they wish to make.  There are some angsty decisions about how much you may need to bid for that essential commodity, how many things you can realistically bid for, and which precious bonus it's necessary to abandon hope of.  

The rest is straightforward tile placing to surround point scoring buildings and church towers or to fulfill the conditions of bonus cards.

Production quality is good.  The artwork is pretty dreadful.

RATING: 7
Nice light bidding game. It is a quite competitive game because it uses the one round bidding mechanic. Also each player sets their bidding amounts at the start of each year. i like the secret goal cards because they are harder to accomplice than they look. The game plays in about an hour and it needs 4 or 5 players to shine.

RATING: 5
One of Feld's less impressive games, it is one of the weakest Euros I played lately and another game that I manage to win by mistake. There is a master strategy when you know your opponents and counting the bidding cards (yes, I know it's hard but I can do it) gives you a huge strategic advantage in the last turn.

This game will unlikely see more table time, yet I will consider it when introducing new people to the board games world.

RATING: 8
A pleasant surprise, Strasbourg features an auction mechanic that feels fresh and interesting to think about.  Admittedly, the game lacks a tangible connection to its ostensible theme, but the auctions and constant enjoyable interactivity generated by the game more than compensate.

This seems like an atypical or unusual Feld design; yet, I can see some parallels to "In the Year of the Dragon" in terms of the "in full view from the start" ordering of things, and the basic but pleasant spatial concerns of Macao and Luna. Of the two Feld auction games, I greatly prefer Strasbourg to Speicherstadt.  

After our first play of this game, all three players wanted to play it again, a good sign.  Srasbourg is on the border between a 7 and an 8 for me, but for innovation, freshness and fun, Strasbourg definitely deserves the 8.

Yet another great Feld in which you're vying for influence over various city council members, nobility and guilds to score the prestige (VP) that wins you the game. Auction mechanics in which you bid stacks of influence cards to determine order in different round phases, and also there's a bit of a placement mechanic in the city spaces, with some risky, Ticket to Ride-like goal cards you can choose (1-5) at the beginning of play. Awesome, colorful game.

Blind bidding.  Hard work.  Felt a little contrived.  With only three builds available in each area, there is no room for error when trying to satisfy task cards.  One player badly stitched in final bid and wide disparity in scores suggested significant amount of luck in game.

Sokkal jobb játék annál, mint amire a szabálymagyarázat alapján számítottam. És nehezebb is:)
Káoszosnak gondoltam előtte, de játszva nem annyira éreztem annak. Ötletes a pakliképzés módja, és az hogy egy lapot visszakapunk a vesztes paklikból (ez drasztikusan csökkenti a szerencse szerepét!)
Sajnos van 2 komoly hibája a játéknak. Az egyik, hogy a tábla ormótlan, kihasználatlan, hatalmas üres részek vannak rajta, miközben csomó információ hiányzik (pl. áruk árlistája...), gondolom a nagyobb dobozért több pénzt lehet kérni. A másik ami nem tetszik, az a célkártyák aránytalan rendszere. A nagy pontszámú kártyák szinte teljesíthetetlenek, a kis pontszámúak meg szinte maguktól adódnak, azokból akár 3-4 is gond nélkül meg van, ha viszont valakinek nem olyan jut, akkor ez 10-15 pontos hátrányt jelenthet... (nálunk 50 körül szóródtak a pontok)
Összességében nem átütő játék, mégis leülök hozzá máskor is szívesen, mert van benne valami izgalmas. A Feldtől megszokott ötletesség ugyanis nem hiányzik belőle, csak valahogy nincs olyan jól összerakva, és talán kevés is kicsit.

Feld does auctions. And he does them in a pretty novel and refreshing way, of course.

This game is a sequence of 35 auctions.

If things are put this way, it can seem quite boring.
But, what if, to win these auctions, you have just a deck of 24 cards, with values 1-6? And you have to draw as many cards as you want and divide the drawn cards in pre-set bids at the beginning of each turn (which is a sequence of 7 auctions)?
That makes for a surprisingly fresh take on an auction game, with lots of enjoyable tension.

Add to this clever mechanism a bit of area control and some secret objectives (helping in differentiating intrinsic value of each auction for each player), and voilà: another great game by mr. Feld!

I'd heard mixed reviews of this Feld game and I have mixed reviews of his games myself. Overall, I like it quite a bit. It seems to require 5 players... Without 5, I think the tension and planning would be reduced. With 5, it's a rough go (in a good way). Players receive goal cards at the start and need to make their plan, Ticket to Ride style. You keep the goal cards you think you can get and ditch the rest. If you complete the card, you get points. If you don't complete the card, you lose 3 points. That provides some of the tension as there are 5 rounds and you may need to place 3 family members in a certain area of the city... it's only possible to place workers there in 3 of the 5 rounds. So, if you aren't planning ahead and determining which auctions you will participate in then you will miss out.

I will play Strasbourg more. It feels like a quality game and I'd like to try again to see if that holds true over several plays.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
Fun, quick auction game with a bit of area control.  I really like having to make your "bid stacks" in the planning phase, and trying to figure out what you think your opponents will do.  I also think its neat to pick your scoring conditions early on, and having to discard what you don't think you can do since they are worth negative points.  The more the better in this one, but 3 does work.  One of the better Feld's I have played for sure, and one I would like to explore further.

Cool bidding game.  Lots of strategic planning involved as you want to ensure you have bidding cards for the later rounds, watching when you can hold a seat on the council for two turns without having to bid.  Deciding on what to go for and how much to put into your bidding stacks.  Board play.  Very Feldian, I think.  And I'm a Feld fan.  It's also pretty quick, too.  Looking forward to playing again with more folk.

Played at Spiel '11 and a couple of times since, during which it grew on me.
The "planned auction" mechanism in Strasbourg is very good: 
Each player has 24 cards (values 1-6). There are 5 rounds in the game. Each round the players draw as many cards as they like (one at at a time and in secret) from their decks. Then the players arrange the cards into face-down stacks of their choosing (again, in secret). There are up to 9 auctions per round. During each auction, the 1st player chooses whether to bid by turning over one of his stacks. The other players make the same decision in turn order. The player with the highest-valued stack wins the auction and the players with the 2nd and 3rd valued stacks sometimes gain smaller benefits.

The idea of preparing all the bids for one round is really interesting. Gets a bit repetitive, however, in the course of the game.

RATING: 6
Wow. Another spectacular follow up from Stefan Feld. 

Tension, anxiety, depth in 60 minutes!

Different players have different end-of-game objectives that are punished if not completed. And this is determined at the beginning of the game by how aggressive you want to be by the number of objectives you keep.

A very novel and new, once-around bidding mechanism. Lurve it.

In theory, this game sounds great: budget your hand each round so you can win spaces to score big at game end. Unfortunately, in practice the game just feels so repetitive: auction, then auction again, then again, and again. There is some tension, and the occasional exciting, unexpected moment can occur, but overall the game is just too dry and repetitive to warrant keeping. A Feld miss for me, I'm afraid.

Stefan Feld makes another Cracker. What a tricky little game? Try to get points from all over the place. Task cards, edifices, people in guilds. It's the trying to manage your deck of influence cards that is the tricky part as you might not get what you need to complete the task or sell your goods. Great plans can disappear in moments with this game. Love the tension it creates. 6 Plays.

RATING: 7.5
Stefan Feld keeps me entertained once again with an interesting take on one of my favourite game mechanics, auction / bidding.  Prior to the start of each round, players draw cards from their "influence" deck and partition those cards into any number of individual bids they wish, with the number of bids dictating the maximum number of possible actions that a player may take, assuming he is successful in his bids for actions.  Various actions allow players to control guilds, obtain / sell goods, and occupy regions of the city.  At the same time, each player has secret task cards that give extra points at game end if he achieves specific patterns of city occupation, but cost points if those objectives are unfulfilled.  The flow of this game is very smooth, and each player has to keep an eye on the others until the very end.  All in all, a good Euro.

Great (of course). Finally got around to buying/playing. Very novel/interesting system. The use of private goals works well to create variations in players motivations, but players don't need to worry too much about figuring out what each others goals are. The goals are [i]much[/i] harder than I first thought when looking at them. Unfortunately, however, I don't think the difficulty/reward ratio is always balanced, and is affected unevenly across the cards for various player counts. Still, great system, which I hope will gets lots of play.

First impression: This game only uses one mechanism - blind bidding. You have almost no control over your fate, you only real decision is how many cards you draw at the start of a round!

RATING: 4
I find it difficult to judge Strasbourg. It is, of course, as artificial and as constructed as all other games of Stefan Feld, so in that regard he is proving to be a consistent author reminiscent of Reiner Knizia. Mechanically, the game appears to work, is even novel in the approach the players are taking in order to prepare their bids, and how these are subsequently rewarded. So definitely marks there. What I’m not sure about is whether these mechanics and their combination is actually [i]interesting[/i]. Take for example the part where a player prepares his bid. He doesn’t really know, nor can he guesstimate, what his fellow players are putting out. Only when a bidding phase is underway do matters resolve themselves, and that is only because of information about the number of players still to come. The defense against this is a privilege... but he only gets that when, by sheer force of will, he ‘won’ an earlier round. A bit of a catch-22 there, I think. Another example is the placement game which takes place after bids have been resolved. At low player numbers there is much more control over what happens on the little grid than at high player numbers. The secret assignments become a whole lot more certain as a consequence. But on the other hand the bidding becomes a lot less interesting at low player numbers too. I would hope there is a certain optimum in both curves (say at 4), but the combination feels... clunky, I guess. As if Feld had two ideas he couldn't fit in other games, and then decided to merge these orphans into a bit of a Frankengame. I will probably play in the future, but not with great enthusiasm.

[b]Update[/b] Yup, still not feeling enthusiastic about this one. With four there's definitely more control over what happens in the city, that's a good sign. But I'm a bit uncomfortable about the apparent need to be everywhere in order to do well, and the effect this appears to have on the bids. I do not want to play a game where bids are won based on very small point differences and the seating order (rather like Chocolatl, in fact).

RATING: 7
Components: Chunky meeples. Color city district. Functional coins (I like the different sizes for the different denominations). I wouldn't mind if the trading symbol on the auction tracks differed more from the guild symbols.

Experience: I don't recall having played an auction game that is both so forgiving (awarding third place, and allowing losers to reclaim a card), but also so cruel (if I miss out on a crucial guild in round 1, I might have permanently blown my chances at completing a task). These two extremes help make the game both tough and fun. Budgeting my hand is interesting (how many cards to draw, how many piles to allocate, how to spend the piles), as is selecting where in a guild's district to place my meeple. Money is tight, and I must trade in my tiles efficiently. One downside is that with some of the tasks being so specific, I often don't have a choice on which actions to bid for: either I must win, or I must save my cards for a different action; I seldom found myself in a position of picking up some action at a bargain rate (not because there weren't bargains to be had, but because I couldn't spare the cards).

Although the game as a whole is not much like Ra, the auctions are Ra-ish, as bidding is limited in both opportunity and amount. You cannot possibly participate in every auction, so you need to choose wisely, and the task cards you select at the game's beginning will drive those decisions. Play this if you enjoy planning ahead.

There is more depth to Strasbourg than you'd expect at first glance. Do I go for a lot of mission cards or do I just keep one and use my "freedom" to place my meeples in places where they'll score a lot of points? Do I bid on this guild although I don't really need it but it won't be bid on again and so my meeple will rest there for another three rounds giving me three victory points? Do I risk to place my bid right now or will I be overbid later? 

Every turn, there's a lot to think about, but in spite of that, the downtime is really low. This is achieved by the simultaneous planning phase where most of the players' decisions are made. A little bit of downtime can be seen in the bidding phase when everyone decides whether the want to place a bid or not. But this moments are usually tense as you're paying attention to the moves of your opponents.

I guess, the game get's only better with repeated plays as there are always new things to discover and Strasbourg will reach a whole new level once you know all the mission cards and the blocking of opponents becomes a reliable and valid strategic option.

To sum it up: Strasbourg is a great, tense auction game that I can recommend wholeheartedly!

This one never really gelled for me.   The 'making bidding piles' mechanic seems so convoluted, and the difficulty on the end goals meant lots of negative points for all players.  Probably won't play this again.

A pure auction game that has some original ideas - such as drawing as many cards as you want, and then pre-arranging your hand each round into separate bids (face down).   The secret goals can be frustrating and also hard to value on the first play.  This is one of those games where you just need to play it once to see how everything works and scores, and then it's pretty simple.   Don't think I need to own it, but would be happy to play it a few more times.

RATING: 7
Bidding mechanics are great but I didn't like the randomness of the goal cards that were maybe somewhat unbalanced in my opinion. 

Many of the best cards had inaccessibly heavy requirements - to have only those cards and maybe some of the weakest but easiest ones vs. to have a hand full of middle level cards that have reasonable requirements and still pretty good points is not well balanced situation, I think.

Must be very careful to get goods sold at just right time because it's the only way to make money that is needed for buying the guild slots. And because only the first bidder can sell things and it all comes by blind bidding, you can barely be sure that you will be successful. I failed my game in that section. Still not bad, maybe I will try again someday.

RATING: 3
Rating based on one play (5 players) - possibly my least enjoyable gaming experience so far.  I have two problems with this game: firstly that the resources felt very tight, exacerbated by the bidding system. This severely restricted options to the extent that two players had missed their task card conditions by the start of the second round, which was rather demoralising.  Secondly, the task card conditions are rather uneven - some task cards give points to players clustering around edifice squares that also yield a handsome points bonus in themselves.  Perhaps with more experienced players who knew to pay less heed to the task cards there would be more competition for spots next to the edifices and gaining those task card points would be more of a challenge.

People who enjoy auction mechanics and working with restricted resources will probably have a better experience than I did.  I want to try it again just to give it a fair shot, but so far it just wasn't fun for me.

Played this in Essen a couple of years back, played again after, and again yesterday. meh.

I did win yesterday, but that made no difference.

Not just another good game by Feld, but another GREAT one.  While it's not as "heavy" as his other endeavors, the game offers excitement, fun, and a LOT of tension.  Beware of major pitfalls early in the game!  Another bonus is it can be taught within 15 minutes, but make no mistake... this game (while more approachable for families and non-gamers) is still very much a "gamer's game".

Strasbourg also features an innovative system for players to formulate their bids - giving a unique spin on the "once around" bidding mechanic.  It's no wonder Feld is my favorite designer, and this game deserves to be ranked among his best.  Thank you for another masterpiece that will likely remain in my game collection for life.  Grade: A-

THE blind-bidding game for gamers.  There's wise bidding, a crucial spatial element, area majority: lots of stuff I love combined into one cool 60-minute package.  I appreciate the way each player has a limited set of currency to use in auctions, but has almost complete freedom as to how much of that currency to use per round, and then after dividing it up into any number of groups, how to use each group for the various powers and actions being bid for.  Between this and The Speicherstadt, I love the way Feld does auctions! The theme may be irrelevant, but there are some very intriguing mechanics here.

Nagyon érdekes mechanikájú, igazi brainburner játék. A működés legérdekesebb (és legagycsavaróbb) pontja a licitekhez történő pénzkupac-képzés. Itt aztán mindent számba kell venni, ami addig a játékban történt, és megpróbálni rájönni, hogy ebben a körben mi fog történni.
5-en játszottunk, és volt egy olyan érzésem, hogy esetleg kevesebb emberrel nem működik ilyen jól a játék, de ki kell próbálni. Ami még nekem nem annyira tetszett, hogy a tematika és mechanika kapcsolata nem túl mély. Ahogy mondani szoktam: ez lehetne akár kutyavásár is.
Bármikor szívesen játszok vele, de meg nem venném a tematika hiánya miatt.

Strasbourg is another entry in a string of recent Euro releases that doesn't really bring anything new to the table but combines old and proven mechanics in different and (sometimes) interesting ways.

In this case we have an auction game that would be almost entirely tactical in nature if it weren't for the secretly assigned goals which add a strong strategic component. A non-descript medieval theme probably isn't too much of a suprise in a Feld game, and the half-blind bidding may be another negative for some but I always felt there was still enough control left for decisions to actually matter. I'm not so sure I like the goals that require you to win a single specific auction, though, especially since there could be competing goals for exactly the same auction while others can complete theirs mostly uncontested.

In its core is a pretty standard euro game, where you bid for privileges to place on the board, getting wares which can give you gold. As with many other bidding games you want to get the stuff you need as cheap as possible. What you need is dependent on randomly dealt role cards and things that are present on the board. Before a round you draw cards from a deck with money valued 1-6 and secretly arrange them in sets which you bid for during the round which consists of several once around auctions. In all, I found it pretty dynamic and interesting despite that I am usually lukewarm towards bidding games nowadays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
You need a great amount of frustration tolerance to play this, as it mostly consists of bidding and a bit of tile laying or set collection.
The bidding part is hard to predict and full of imponderabilites. If you're outgessing your opponents well, bidding can turn out satisfactory but if you're always losing a bid by one influence point then you're not doing much and are more of a specatator than an actor. I don't like the inflexible money management.
So this game is not for everyone and you should try it before buying it (or not).

Typical S.Feld game, meaning, tough choices, many options, which one will you choose that will help you along the way to win the game?? 

I like the math here. 5 rounds with 9 phases. For each phase, you need to use cards to win anything at all. But you only have 24 cards for the whole game!!! Now what??!!  :)

But not to worry, if you don't win anything in particular phase, you get to take 1 card back. So you're not really up the creek with no paddle. However, you need to plan your choices carefully and anticipate what other will go for. 

Very tight game, interesting choices, fierce competition. Really, one of the more exciting game of his, without being overwhelming like Luna or Trajan.

I recommend it very wholeheartedly.

Boring, abstract and derivative auction game, with elements that work better in other designs, such as "Santiago", "Metropolys", or even "Oregon". I concede that the bidding system is somewhat novel, but that is the worst part of the game. There is an annoying lack of control and significant turn order bias. Having to select the value of your bids - from random draws - before the round of auctions starts just makes you often overpay or waste your cards.

I really liked that in the game, you have a set number of cards to us for 'bidding' throughout the game. Once used they are out of the game. They come out random, so that could be a game breaker to some people. To me it just adds to the 'excitement'.

Beneath a typically thin euro theme lies a unique game that is simultaneously brutally punishing and tons of fun. It took me 1 round into my first 5-round game to realize that I had screwed everything up irrevocably. Even knowing that, I finished the game enjoying myself the whole time.

It's difficult to even describe this game mechanically because so many elements are present, yet they work together very well. The auction is the main characteristic and it bears some similarities to Ra. Each auction is a single-bid-per-player affair, which makes going last a big advantage. Also as in Ra, you will only have a limited number of auctions you can win each round. However, you will determine at the start of each round what that number will be. Your bidding is done with cards numbered 1-6. These cards will be placed into face-down piles and the number of piles you make will be the total number of bids you get. The total number of cards you draw is completely at your discretion. Each round, you draw cards one at a time from your own personal deck and decide when the time is right to stop drawing. However, you only have 24 cards to last you all 5 rounds. I love how the game doesn't limit you from drawing a 10-card hand if it's an important round. Instead you just have to deal with the consequences of being limited later. 

The things being auctioned don't generally grant victory points in and of themselves, but are instead placed in various arrangements on a shared center board. The proximity to each other and to the other pieces will determine much of your final score. You also receive several secret goal cards at the start of which you may keep any number. These vary wildly in terms of difficulty, but most are harder to complete than it would first appear. 

This is a game that certainly rewards repeat plays, but never makes you feel lost. You always have a clear direction of what you are trying to do, but will often be thwarted by your poor estimation of how much other players are willing to bid for the same thing. As with the best auction games, there is no calculable answer for how much you SHOULD bid. It is all relative to board position, secret goals, and other players. Seems like a winner in my book, but I feel I am only scratching the surface.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The completely new bidding mechanism really shines, I enjoyed that a lot. Everyone gets a deck of numbered cards, and is free to draw as many as they please at the beginning of each round. Then they sort them into face-down stacks of cards which they use to bid on actions. You'll never get your cards back, so not wasting them is crucial. The scoring mechanism borrowed from Ticket to Ride (fulfilled cards get scored, unfulfilled give a penalty) works well here, with some of the cards being really tough to pull off. There is little chance to recover from a mistake, so don't screw up. I don't get to play this very often but I enjoy it every time.

RATING: 7.5
Strasbourg is a very clever auction game, where players try to achieve multiple goals and accumulate influence in the City through business.
Each round has several auctions, for positions of key influence, for lesser influence in guilds, and for the rights to sell goods (and replenish cash, which seems very tight in this game).
Each player has an identical set of cards, but draws them blind, trying to best allocate them each round for what each player needs to accomplish.
So the estimate of what it will take to win an action, and the planning/timing when those actions are required need to work together.
Each player has secret goals- there is a small penalty for failing these, but the rewards can be very lucrative if they layer together and are met.
The game only lasts 5 rounds, and it flies along quite quickly.
This may become one of my favorite auction games- all the layers need to work together, and players have to decide if there are any opportunities where they can step aside from their plans to pick up additional points, or to block opponents.

Blind bidding game in which you have tasks to complete. Although your bid cards are chosen at the start of the round blindly, they are revealed one at a time so players going later can see what has been bid and pass if they've been outbid on that particular auction. Or, you can play a priveledge token if you are going early in the bidding which lets you see the bids before replaying yourself. Another great game from Stefan Feld

NEI!!! Dette er det brettspillet jeg liker minst av Feld. Muligens fordi hovedmekanismen er auksjon. Tror nok ikke jeg vil ha dette spillet! Designet er ok, det er selve spillet jeg ikke finner tiltalende. Det er dessuten for mye tilfeldigheter i forhold til kortene man trekker for å kunne by i auksjonene.
Dette spillet er egentlig for 3-5 spillere, men det er laget en variant for 2 spillere med en "dummy-player", som Rahdo anbefaler og demonstrerer i sin run-through, selv om han mener at spillet ikke fungerer optimalt som 2-player.

Played for first time @ Brooklyn Feld Fest 8/13/16. Before the game starts players have to choose one to five randomly drawn endgame scoring bonus cards to keep. If, at the end of the game, you have satisfied the condition illustrated on a card, you are awarded victory points, but if you failed to satisfy the conditions, you will have points deducted from your score. Each player deploys their bidding cards in stacks at the beginning of each of five rounds of play. Each round has 7 quick, once-around auctions. Winning bids award players with area control deployment opportunities that also require cash, goods that can be transformed into money, and council seats. Strasbourg is a points salad game that is driven by auctions. The rules set is not difficult to learn and fairly simple. Players are making many choices throughout the game and it is not easy to form a plan to maximize your score and execute it. There is a significant degree of player interaction in Strasbourg, which I consider a refreshing contrast to several of his other games that I love, but they have a multiplayer solitaire vibe. As far as production value, I would say Strasbourg has good painted wooden meeples and the graphic design on the cards is good, but they are the tiny Euro size cards. The game board is decent looking, a good thickness to it. Relative to all modern board games, Strasbourg has average, undistinguished production value, but relative to the body of Stefan Feld's work to date, Strasbourg is one of the better produced games. Strasbourg has very little down time between turns and doesn't take a long time to play (~1.5 hrs) I look forward to exploring Strasbourg deeper with more plays. 7/10

Plays best with four.  Worker placement area control that can be a little dry (quasi-abstract as the theme is a complete paste-on).  The area control element adds a small degree of randomness to the game that increases re-playability, but only for people who are tolerant of abstracts.

We have accidentally found this game at retail shop. Game mechanics is really innovative and, although all players are focused on own tasks, conflict is inherently involved as board and resources are tight. Game is auction based, but there is really high limit on amount you can bid, so gameplay is affected by your opponents. Although you must win some of auctions, you can never be certain that you will win it, as somebody can always outbid you. That makes development of optimal algorithm almost impossible.
Strasbourg has huge replayability as auctions' order is chosen randomly each game.

Dry as Sahara, very mechanical, typical euro-game.

Completely nothing inspiring here.  No mark of Stefan Feld (or any designer whatsoever) on this design.  In fact, I have a hard time believing that was made by an author as renowned as Feld.

This is light years from excellent 'In the Year of the Dragon' and visibly worse than 'Notre Dame' by the same designer...

This game has a different feel than other Feld games. Somehow feels more like a Knizia auction game. Every decision in this game matters from the get go. Each player begins every round with a set of cards with varying influence values, so you have to sort of read your opponent's mind as to how to get the best out of every auction. The hidden objectives is also very interesting. It's not a mechanic that everyone likes but it adds a new level of complexity for experienced players to "guess" each other's objective and try to block them. Definitely needs more plays for this game to shine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A very neat auction mechanic with a fairly neat spatial mechanic and an interesting way of insuring that no two games are the same with the varying 'what's up for bid' strips. Requires at least one play before you really get how it works. The wide random variance in the objective cards keeps this at 'rather good' instead of 'great.'

doesn't feel like a Feld game, at least nothing like his other offerings in recent years.  Deciding on how may bid cards, and how to group and separate them and when to use which bid is all very tense.  I came in 2nd on 1st play without keeping any of the bonus cards (I mistakenly believed each bonus you didn't get was minus that many points instead of just -3... but it worked out great as I was able to focus on getting valuable spots on the board instead)

What a good auction Feld game. I played it after I have played Amerigo and Bruges and I like it better than both of those games. It plays very quickly, but you have a lot of tension and interesting decisions to make each turn. I particularly liked the planning phase and the managing of your limited deck. The bidding mechanism is great and the game plays very quickly! The rules are easy to explain and the game components look gorgeous on the board.

There is not much room for mistakes, if you failed to advance the goal in the relevant guild, you probably lost that goal already. I love it!

I will buy it sometime in the future. Good stuff.

I really like Strasbourg because it plays very quickly, there is minimum downtime, however the decisions are not obvious in any way. It has a lot of depth in a very short time frame. 

It is one of the less know Felds, however it is very expensive right now. 

One of 2011´s favorites.

Like ITYOTD, enjoy being able to more or less plan out the entire game's strategy from the first round, love the innovative mechanics and the guesswork/opponent reading, attractive board.  Only negative-3+ player (we're almost exclusively 2) and players who have played previously have a serious advantage over those who have not.

This is a fun medium weight auction/area control game. The rules are fairly simple, but it has a decent amount of depth. Auction games are, by definition, pretty interactive, and this one is no different in that regard. It adds an element of area control (sort of) that increases the interactivity a bit, too. I like this game. It's a shame it is not readily available in the US.

Strasbourg is played over 5 rounds, with each round consisting of 7 auctions. Each player has a personal deck of 24 cards with values from 1-6. At the start of a round, players draw as many cards as they like from their deck and create face-down auction "lots" of any amount of cards that they can use for bids that round. The deck must last all 5 rounds, so players need to pace themselves. I call this "blind planning" because you don't know what values others are assigning to their auction lots and what you will need to be competitive. As the round progresses, you use your lots to try to win auctions which allow you to place pieces on the board, collect goods, or trade goods for money (which you need to place pieces on the board).

You collect points in-game for placing pieces and buildings and at the end of the game for achieving goal cards that are dealt out when you start. The blind-planning is the interesting piece. The rest of the game is quite pedestrian and goals are difficult to accomplish. The planning piece was enjoyable, with the right amount of control and unpredicability. The key element of the game is timing your auctions effectively. However, that aspect alone is not enough to keep me interested in a crowded field of medium-weight auction games. For me, The Speicherstadt is a better Feld auction title.

Cool light game, some luck involved with the mission cards though. Some cards just don't pay enough for the effort they take, so you should just focus on doing overall good stuff (like building around edifices).

My 2nd favorite Feld behind Luna. Mid-weight medieval guild-themed game involving auctions, spatial placement, a bit of economy, and hidden goals. Typical Feldian interlocking clockwork mechanisms with an unusual approach (one might say a "blind bidding" approach) to allocating one's bid cards for each round. The bidding deck is the heart of the game and interesting to figure out and play around with. Plays very smoothly.

This game now convinces me that Feld is one of the best if not THE best designer of this decade, the way he keeps cranking out gem after gem, he is at the top of his game.

I played a game of this and it was okay. I didn't love it but I didn't hate it either. There are some very interesting long-term planning decisions that need to be made, and it can be hard to stick to your plan. Feld does a good job avoiding the shitty-card-draw pit falls, it's definitely a well thought out game that lots of people will enjoy.

I just don't think I'm one of those people. I would happily play it again but it doesn't stand out for me. I don't like the very discrete auction like bidding. I don't like that sometimes your plan will collide with someone else and there just doesn't seem to be options for flexibility that I enjoy in his other games.

=================================================
Read the rules.

It seems good but I need to play it. You really have to plan everything and I'm not keen on the secret mission aspect. Random draws might influence things too much.

It isn't the type of Feld game that I really love (Notre Dame, Year of the Dragon), I have to play this one first for sure.

What was Pegasus thinking when they contracted this artwork? If I hadn't read and heard good comments about Strasbourg the box cover would have been enough to keep me from playing. But Stefan Feld currently is the most reliable medium to heavy-weight German game designer together with Uwe Rosenberg. None of his big box games disappointed recently and Strasbourg is no exception. The auction mechanism is really clever. Principally, all players have the same amount of influence to win auctions but clever resource allocation and efficient bids will go a long way. When to bid heavily and when to save your resources is determined by personal goal cards and worker allocation on the building grid. I would rank this among his top titles and I like it better than Notre Dame or Year of the dragon for instance.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
another good feld game. You choose how much you allocate for bidding each round. Everyone has the same fixed amt of cards but how it gets dispersed is up to player. You need to win bids to get nobles in power get your pawns in districts to help your end game scoring cards. A very good game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yet another boring and overused theme, but somewhat fresh mechanics make for a solid game, no surprise here. I enjoy the shuffled money draw as well as the way bidding works. My one minor reservation is with the hidden scoring goals. It's obvious why it's hidden, but it seems like some goals overlap better with others, and a poor draw can make it a little unfair, though I wonder if a pure "put your guys next to buildings" strategy could work.

It seems like a game like this would have been a huge hit a few years ago, but these types of games are so commonplace that it is surprising how it has flown under the radar. I guess the weird distribution issues may have had something to do with it.

Great game. Theres an interesting mechanic of dividing cards into auction piles. I would've liked more competition for auction spaces but the game is simple and it works.

RATING: 8
This is not blind bidding!  The bidding is a once around bid with all the previous bids visible.  What's new here is that your available bids are pre-determined for the whole round (7 auctions), and you get to decide how many cards you want to use at the beginning of each round (you have limited cards for the whole game).  This is the delicious / agonizing part of the game.

So you cannot plan for everything that happens in this game.  You kind of have to go with the flow.  

With 3 players the bidding is much easier and often you can pick up "bargains".  5 players is very difficult and I think you'll have to concentrate your forces.  I think the sweet spot might be 4 players (which I have not tried yet)

Nothing especially new, but a good game with a beaten to death theme. The game is weakened by both the bidding cards which make planning ahead at times almost impossible as well as the bonus points tickets which are like in so many other games an unnecessary and unbalanced addition.

The bidding mechanic is cool and new. And you really have to strategize the whole game - this isn't just a tactical affair. But like many Stefan Feld games, the supporting cast doesn't hold to the mechanic. The blind objectives are annoying. Blind bidding PLUS blind objectives? Ugg.

One of my favourite auction games, the influence card mechanic is so unique and makes for really difficult decisions at the beginning of every round. The scoring cards are tough to achieve and contribute to a very tight game that plays quickly, definitely best at 5 players. Plays in about 75-90 minutes at full player count, the restrictive scoring is very different for a Feld game, and the limited opportunities to execute your plans make for excruciating decisions when formulating your bids for each round.

A very basic euro game with blind bidding included - luckily the bidding system isn't totally luckfest  - actually there is quite a lot what to consider. Big issue here is, that there aren't enough new or unique ideas and the interesting part - tickets - are a way too straightforward. Those tickets should bring more competition and blocking between players (like TtR).

Push your luck* defines your "sun tokens" in the Ra bidding mechanism here which is taken one step further: it's not really bidding as even Nr. 2. and Nr. 3. wins something... A nice mix of this special mechanism combined with hidden goals* and strategic placement of your men on the board.

*So this one has two mechanisms that are not only about combination and optimization but fun. That's what I prefer in Euros... and it seems the SdJ jury too.

Typical (although this one is somewhat under rated) Feld game with a somewhat more limited scope.  Fairly abstract tile control game with an innovative & interesting semi-auction mechanic.  Re-playability is dubious (sure you randomize the rounds and edifices but still). Limited in variety, scope and theme.  A bit finicky as the whole game often hinges on one or two auctions near the end, but fast to play and good fun so far.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Honestly, I don't know quite what to think about this quasi blind bidding game.  It definitely takes a unique twist to auctions.

LIKES:

* The unique twist to quasi blind bidding is quite different.  Everyone has the same 24 cards for bidding purposes that must last you for all 5 rounds.  In some cases, players may choose to use 8 cards in one round and only 3 in another, etc depending on their objectives.  As well, you set up your bids in different piles based on what you think you want to pursue and each stack can only be used in one of the seven auctions each round - you cannot combine your stacks.  Each auction is also once around in most cases although you could play a privilege to pass and possibly enter later in the auction.  Just an odd auction mechanic overall.
* Rules are easily understood and game play is straightforward - you just have to master the auction mechanic.
* If the auction isn't to turn tiles into money, there is a reward for coming in second and possibly third so you don't lose everything.  If you totally lose out, you can keep the highest card in your bid for a later round.
* Goals play a key role in the game and will often dictate your auctions.  You have a choice of keeping 1-5 goals given to you before the game starts.

DISLIKE:

* The goals are tough to judge in your first play.  Tough to know what to keep, what to get rid of so I would advise keeping only a couple the first game as failed goals cost you -3 points.

OG Review: Strasbourg is an extremely uninspired exercise in blind-bidding.  A series of repetitive auctions where players lock in their bids ahead of time and try to read each other’s mind, not my idea of a good time when the random difference between bids of one or two can be critical.
The bidding is keen & competitive.

Hey, if this is a German game, and if it's the 16th century, shouldn't this game be called Straßburg?

Must be my favourite game. Nothing about it is difficult to grasp or deal with, but is it ever challenging to play. 

I think the theme is great, but that kind of shows what a Germanophile/Europhile I am. 

I always have some Kronenbourg 1664 and pretzels on hand for this one.

Wow. Just when I thought I had Feld figured out, I come across this auction/area majority game. Using a fixed set of cards as the bidding currency both channels Ra and feels completely innovative. Play is tight, highs are high and lows are low. This is a near-perfect game and should be a hit for any auction fan, but accessible enough to all because it doesn't have the usual problem of new players not recognizing the value of bids. Highly recommended.

Probably the meanest game Feld has ever designed. The draw of this game is how you handle your deck of bids, and knowing how to balance them out and bid correctly from round to round.

Secret goals, blind biddings, some player screwage. Kind of like Taj Mahal for trying to know when to win and when to give up. I like especially how you customize your piles to anticipate which bidding part would be hot, and which one you can get with relatively low bids. The hidden goals make the game more diversifed in the ways of getting points. It's a highly underrated gem.

I've only played an aborted 3er (aborted because 1/3 of the way through we finally saw the 3-player exception to the guild auctions), but can see the potential. I like the hidden objectives and the unique auction mechanic.
----
A bit on the dry side, perhaps? After a second play I still see more unfulfilled potential. It is more fun with 5 than 3, but I think playing it with people who have played it before or are better at auction games would have made it more fun. One good thing is that it's a relatively quick game for the weight.
----
OK, it's great, with a unique auction system that is only vaguely reminiscent of Rialto. The game moves very quickly if you can keep people on task. I wish the arc were a bit more pronounced, but the game does have one. Definitely a title that is climbing the ranks as far as Felds go (perhaps trailing only Bora Bora and Macao).

RATING: 7
An auction game(35 auctions), where upon a successful bid, a meeple is placed in a city with 5 colored quarters in 15 goods auctions. The meeples score points themselves and by adjacency to tiles and pins that are also placed as a result of 5 auctions. Meeple placement in the city costs money, that is provided by selling goods in another 15 auctions. The auction currency is on 24 cards, numbered 1 to 6. These cards once used are out of the game.
There are hidden goals related mostly to meeple placement that score end game points.
Need to play more to see if there is any replayability issue, but the hidden goals probably take care of that.
The game is fast, the decisions are interesting but not too taxing. In my opinion, this is the best game of the past couple of years from Feld.

First impression (4 players): I really like the way you do auctions in this game. Just painful enough to draw cards and then form piles. The game itself fell a bit short of my expectations. Could use fifth player to make auctions a bit more involved but on other hand even with just 4 most of the score cards are pretty hard to achieve (and could be accidently/intentionally blocked by someone).

An enjoyable middleweight German gamers' game, revolving around a novel bidding system. I don't agree with Juuso here; Planning for the auctions is not only very possible, it's also quite intriguing and fun, and you have to plan several rounds ahead. 

The end game scoring tickets are so extremely unbalanced that it feels intentional. There are so many more important ways of scoring that the tickets are probably there just to make the auctions a bit less predictable.

Strasbourg is a neat, challenging game with plenty of in-your-face confrontation.

The core idea is as follows: players have individual decks of cards, 4 each of values 1-6. These represent influence. The cards are shuffled at the start, and have to last the entire game: five rounds. Each player secretly deals some cards at the start of each round. Every card dealt has to be accepted, none can be returned for later. So there is a push-your-luck feel. The cards for each round are then divided into as many as six bids- there are six auctions each round... More than you can hope to participate in! Then there are a series of single-bid auctions for various positions, point-scoring opportunities, and placements.

Ah yes- placements! A significant part of the game is getting your meeples placed onto sites in the city, where they will score for proximity to certain buildings. You also have secret objectives to aim for. There's a whole money management aspect as well (you need cash to place meeples in the city), but the best part of the game is the auction mechanism.

[i]- Upfront planning; you really need to have a plan in this game and pay attention to all 5 rounds, making sure you pinpoint what the auctions will be for you based on the hidden goals you have.
- Auction mechanic is excellent, you start the game with 24 bidding cards for 35 auctions.

As the rules began I was thinking I'm about to enter auction hell, but good old Feldy saved the day. Draw your bidding power from an Ave Caesar deck that has to last you 5 rounds and, knowing what auctions are coming up each turn, separate your bid cards into bid lots which can't be changed once the round has started. Each auction is then a once-round affair, with people giving up one of their lots as a bid, or not. It's very much like Ra (great pedigree) but using hidden bid tiles. It misses the fun of the tile-pulls with Ra though because the auctions are set each round - winners get to place meeples on the board, or bonus pieces, or gain money for previously placed meeples so you can place yet more meeples later. There's a point for winning an auction (mostly), plus motza's for placing meeples next to bonus pieces, plus more for fulfilling bonus cards at the start of game, usually requiring placing meeples in various areas or patterns. Anyway, add it all up after an hour and see how it turns out. The game can be surprisingly and accidentally cruel if you lose an auction you really needed to win by only having a bid available that's a dollar short - as there's nothing you can do about it. So it's a game mostly about planning ahead a bit and then sucking it up if you didn't create big enough bids, or getting/feeling lucky if things turn out ok. Which means it wouldn't enter regular rotation, but I'd be fine playing it if suggested as it plays surprisingly quickly once you get going.

Not his best game. The game mechanic works fine, it just is to dry for my taste. Much of the game board is not necessary for playing this game. It should have come in a smaller box.

Based on one play: An original auction game where you draw from a deck of 24 cards at the start of you turn. You must decide how many cards to draw each turn (out of five) and pre-set them into bidding piles. Then the seven auctions start and each player can bid when they want in order to get influence, place meeples on the board and/or get goods to later sell. It plays in about 75 minutes and accomplishing you end of game point cards is not as easy as you may think. Luckily, you get five at the start and keep only the ones you want to.

Solid with interesting bidding mechanic. Replay value? We'll see....

Update over 2 years later, 11-18-2013:  

Well, this game keeps coming back to the table periodically (8 plays now). Delicious tension in the card selection phase makes this a game my group really likes.

Each game consists of exactly 35 once around auctions. You know at the start of the game which auctions will come up when. You need to decide which ones are the most important for your strategy (and match best with the goal cards you received at the beginning of the game) as you can't participate in every auction.

Each person has a randomized personal deck of only 24 cards (same values for all players) from which you can draw as many cards as you want for each round (which consists of 7 auctions).  Be careful though, if you draw too many cards in round two (to guarantee you have the card values to allow you to win a particular auction) you may not have enough cards left over to win the auctions you need in the last round.

We felt that a player could have an unfair advantage if the personal goal cards they randomly received at the beginning of the game were particularly synchronistic. As a result we have instituted a draft selection of goal cards at the beginning of the game.

RATING: 5
This is a ridiculously tight bidding game where you are fighting off random card draws to try to beat your opponents to unknowingly taking the spaces you desperately need to get points and to not suffer uncompleted goal penalties. Many of the secret goal cards push up against other cards, so the game really forces you to put everything into winning the few things you need, and then hope that another player didn't happen to randomly draw and then is able to complete higher value cards. For example, a common goal is to have three meeples in one color region of the board. There are three auctions to place a guy with the top 2 bidders getting to place, assuming they have the money to do so. Mess that up once, and rather than getting a ton of points for your card, you get -3. We didn't enjoy this game at all.

I'm not a fan of Stefan Feld, and while Strasbourg isn't his worst, it's not one I'm keen to play again either. Feld seems to do all the things Knizia gets ripped for, and none of the things that make Knizia great.

Like most Feld games it has an 'innovative' mechanism, in this case Ra-style bids that are generated by the players each round. But I wasn't sure it really worked - it ends up as an auction game where players don't really know each others' valuations (because they depend on secret goal cards), possible bids, or current holdings (hidden by a player screen). So it felt that getting 'bargains' came down less to skill and more to vagaries of turn order and whether other players happened to be on collision course with you.

Interesting bidding game where you are trying to win some battles (not all) in order to meet personal objectives.

I won this game in a BGG contest in autumn of 2013 (my only win to date, yay!) - any game I liked published by Pegasus, and my wife and I chose this one as we are both big Feld fans. I have still only played this a handful of times, and while it's not a game I can ever see being played regularly, it's been enjoyed by everyone I've played it with, and I think it has much to offer, without being a classic or a game I always will want to play. Although in actual fact it's clearly a game that needs several plays, ideally with the same group, to really get a grip on (in terms of guessing which task cards other players may be going for). As always with Feld, there are some interesting mechanics and interactions, but this is more streamlined than most of his games - and leads to some quite agonising decisions, not only in deciding how many bidding cards to take and how to distribute them, but also in whether and what to bid at each turn. This appears to be a highly interactive game in that I doubt you can do well - at least among seasoned players - without watching exactly what everyone else is doing and what bids they have left.

In short, while this is a lighter Feld, it's also probably one of his most unjustly under-appreciated games. And, like Speicherstadt (which is otherwise a very different game), this should appeal to many gamers who dislike Feld's more well-known and complex designs.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
As an auction game of sorts Strasbourg lacks the tension usually found in such games. This happens to be a good thing in my case as I find auction games a bit too 'serious' and newbie unfriendly for my taste.

So Strasbourg does succeed as a light game with some form of auction mechanic thrown in and I like it.

I will however contradict what I just said by saying that it might be a bit too light a game for regular play as the tension is a bit too subdued.

When it comes to the Feld spectrum, I initially thought I liked Strasbourg better than the Speicherstadt, but I think the later has more of an identity of its own than Strasbourg has.

... so a good game to play with casual players, but possibly a bit dull if played too frequently due to the relative lack of depth.

 With easy rules and a shortish playing time, this at first sight would seem to be one of Feld's lighter games. In fact it is strategic, tough, tense and unforgiving. I have reservations however about the luck of the draw for the task cards - that the winner is often the person who picks up cards that happen to synchronise best. Some form of card drafting, as suggested by others, might be the way to go.

An ok auction game - the fact that you need to win a bid to get money is quite interesting, but I really don't like the randomness of what goal cards you get dealt, and it's quite hard for new players to understand what bids are most critical for them to be able to complete their goals.  I think an obvious variant would be to lay out a set of goal cards face-up at the beginning of the game (1 or 2 x the number of players) and all players get the points for each if they are able to complete that goal at the end of a game.  I think this would also provide more interaction as players compete to block each other from completing a particular goal.

It's probably the Feld game I enjoy least, of the ones I play regularly, but as I enjoy all Feld games that's not saying it's bad!  I don't like games with blind bidding for things as a main mechanism, and although it's not quite blind, it does mean that I don't enjoy this as much as I should.  Having said that, I really like the way you play for end-game scoring, and the tightness of the game, and will rarely turn down a game - just won't rush out and buy it.

RATING: 7
Great auction game. I really like how you have to decide how many cards to draw and how to combine them to become the bids for each round before the round actually got started. I also like how you don't have to be first, or even second, to win something in all of these, making it sometimes a good idea just to have a single 1 by itself to let you slip into an auction to get a goods tile or placement.

Only quibble, and it's minor really, is that the goal cards seem a lot simpler to accomplish before you play the game for the first time. One of mine required I participate in three auctions and not lose for one good. No problem, I thought, except I let myself lose a sale which would give me money to place right before one of those auctions. I don't do anything, think 'no big deal', but then I look and that good is only bid on three times in the whole game, so I had to get things set up to ensure I did so. But I'll know that for my second game. It's not really a big deal, but everyone at the table underestimated how easy it was to do their goal cards.

Came to the game being warned it's Feld and I expected I'm not going to like it. 
[i]But it's not a typical Feld, it's not a victory point salad, it's got auctions![/i].
 Two of these three sentences were true. 
It's not a VPS, yet it's a typical Feld, I guess the game made me re-evaluate Feld and realise VPS is just one of possible expression for his signature design approach which is cramming as many mechanics into a game as possible and then letting players optimise their path through them.

If you ever need for somebody to design an auction game that never feels like an auction Feld's your guy. I love auctions for being interactive, this isn't quite, if I'd compare interaction level in it to sex, it would feel like [i]having sex while in space suit in zero G with little rockets attached to your butt and other parts of the body, all of which you would control by pushing three buttons. Repeatedly.[/i] It's technically interaction, sorta, kinda, but even so it soon becomes a contest of how few presses of button one needs to come. [Sorry for the metaphor, it was written immediately after playing]. Okay, I'll give sane reasoning as well: You don't play against other players as you have no idea what their secret goals are and you don't even know what did they put into their bidding piles of cards. You optimise your bids. Period. 

Theme is wafer thin, but as nothing could hide this clockwork spreadsheet it only deserves the blandest themes. I feel compassion for the city of Strasbourg, it didn't deserve this (is this some German retribution as the city is in French hands now?). While I found it less terrible than other Feld's games it's just one I have no interest in playing ever again. Also: I won! (5 player game). By optimising bids better than others. Yay. 

Rating down to 1.0 because: uninspired. Yeah it's a crime.

I rather like that one. It has surprisingly little randomness in it, it seems fairly well balanced, and even though it has some form of bidding, you pretty much exactly get what you pay for. Other than other secret-pile-building games (Dungeon Lords, Dungeon Petz), you also can make your final moves dependent on the moves of the other players, and therefore rarely have to overpay much.

Stefan Feld neve nálam garancia a jó játékra, de a Strasbourg szabályát elolvasva visszahőköltem rendesen. Abszolút nem illik szerintem az eddig Feld játékok sorába, az egész játék ugyanis a jó vak és nyílt liciten múlik. 24 1-től 6-ig számozott kártyapaklija van minden játékosnak, amit 5 körön keresztül kell jól beosztania. A körökön belül is még akár 7 pakliba is rendezheti őket, ugyanis ennyi licitálás történik minden körben. Ezeket a paklikat mindenki maga rendezi el, majd adott kör 7 fázisán keresztül dönti el melyekre használja. A győztes céhekben szerezhet mester címet, elvehet a céh termékéből egyet, amit majd más fázisokban értékesíthet, illetve lehelyezheti egy emberét a céh egyik házába. A céhházakban levő emberekért jár pont, attól függően akár több is, hogy ház vagy kápolna mellett állnak-e. A pontozást a játék végén még az elején kapott TTR szerű célkártyák dobhatják meg. Ez nekem nem igazán tetszett, a Takenokóhoz hasonlóan, lehet szerencsésen húzni ezeket, amivel az egész játék eldőlhet.
Érdekes játék a Strasbourg, a szabály elolvasása után teljes káoszra és gyenge játékmenetre számítottam, de nem vészes a helyzet. Nem az én stílusom a játék, de koránt sem rossz és elég eredeti is. Érdemes kipróbálni.

Originally purchased as a try-and-then-trade, this turned out to be a really great blind auction game. I love all the upfront planning in the secret objectives and then how you've got to budget your auctions over time. There's a great turn order element as well as a psychological one in trying to figure out how much to bid and when to reveal a large bid to get what you want. A very clever auction game - Feld makes yet another great game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good game, actually, despite the blind auctions. Fortunately, though, they're only semi-blind -- and that's good because I generally hate blind bidding games! I think the auction mechanism works very well -- after the first auction, anyway, once you have some idea about how the other players like to bid (or maybe that's just a first-game thing?)! It's actually pretty clever, especially how the winners lose bidding power for late-game auctions (as they lose bid cards) while losers can save up for later -- everyone needs to make their cards last for the entire game, lest someone else (who did do so) swoop in and win some key final auctions! 

I'm not sure it's all that complex (SdJ Kennerspiel nominee) of a game, though!

--- Summary ---
Players each have an identical deck of bidding cards (numbered 1-6? in an uneven distribution) that they shuffle into a personal draw deck, and 5 coins. The board shows
- an area or colored squares corresponding to the 5 different guilds, each with a different range of build costs.
- spaces to show the player currently leading each guild (plus king, bishop, and merchant spots)
- 5 boards, showing the order and type of auctions for each of the 5 rounds, arranged in random order. Place a random building (value 3-7) at the bottom of each board.

At the start of the game, deal 5 bonus cards to each player. Like Ticket to Ride tickets, players choose some of these to hold and score at end of the game (worth 3-14 VP?). Any unfulfilled bonuses, though, penalize you only -3VP.

Each round there are 7 auctions: king/bishop, 3 guilds, 3 merchants. Players first draw cards from their deck -- as many as they want, one by one. Then, everyone divides their cards into face down stacks. To resolve auctions, players either pass or reveal one of their stacks -- once around starting with the previous auction winner (may also discard a privilege token to pass then reenter the auction later). 
- For the king/bishop auction, high bidder is king and 2nd is bishop this round.
- For guilds, high bidder gets a guild token, may pay coin shown on board to place a marker on the square, and becomes head of guild (place marker in guild space); 2nd place chooses either a token, or pays to place a marker on board; 3rd place gets a token. All player markers on the board are worth 1VP at end of game. 
- For merchants: high bidder may sell as many tokens as they like, returning them to supply and taking indicated coins. For final merchant auction, winner becomes merchant leader (place token in that guild leader space).
- For all bids: tie breaker is turn order from the first bidder; high bidder places first bid in next auction. All winning bid cards are removed from game. In losing bids, one card returns to bottom of player deck and the rest (if any) are removed from game.

After the auction, the Bishop places a bishop on one intersection on the board. At the end of the game, the bishop awards 1VP to all player tokens in the 4 (max) adjacent spaces. Then the King places the building onto the board, in one of the empty designated spaces (there are 6 or 7). At the end of the game, all player tokens in spaces adjacent to these buildings score the numbered VP. Players then earn VP for being guild leaders/etc: 1 per token, with the player(s) with the most tokens earning a bonus?

The game ends after the 5th round. Players score VP for tokens on the 
board, nearby bishops and buildings, and their bonus scoring cards -- the one with the most VP wins!

Glad I gave this one a second chance.  I was initially reluctant towards the symbolism, and didn't like how dry and thematically aimless it appeared.  Its chaos and broad point awards made it feel punitive without strategic justification.

Despite drawbacks that are usually nonstarters for me, I always felt very engaged and intrigued by what was going on and the matrix of possible decisions presented to me and my opponents proved to be fascinating.  Great stuff. Once I got over the point spreads and chaos, Strassbourg revealed a highly competitive, fun little jostle that plays in less than an hour.

Will surely play more!

A good solid design (one more) by Stefan Feld. I like him and I think that this game is better than Nornberc. The comparison has to do with the guilds. This game is an auction game that is only playable with 4 or more players but it's fun to play and has its moments. Also on the solar side is the time of play. Much better than Norenberc once again.

Add to this a positional bidding aspect (like in Hold'em) and you have another winner.

Like Merkator for Rosenberg, Strasbourg doesn't feel like a Feld game.  I think this may be why it's not as highly regarded but I really enjoy it.  An auction/area control game.  Definitely not a 'point salad.'

Ah, Stefan. I like the interesting mechanisms you conjure, but I do wish you'd put a little love in to your designs; they really could do with a little soul.

The card mechanisms, for drawing, assigning them to bids and then choosing which bid to offer are all great, but the rest of the game is a dull exercise in area control and positioning. 

I tend to like Feld's fillers (Speicherstadt & Arena: Roma II), though neither are perfect, and to really dislike his bigger games. This falls in the middle and consequently, I'm basically indifferent to it.

If the card mechanisms appear in a different game, I'd be interested in trying it out. In *this* game, I'm not overly bothered to go through it again.

Érdekes játék. Egészen más élmény volt, mint amire a szabály olvasása után számítottam. 

Van benne valami, hogy az egykörös licit, meg a Medicire emlékeztető aukciós játékélmény az előnyére válik. De kell még játszak vele, hogy megítélhessem, tényleg jó-e.

Stefan Feld mindenesetre szép munkát végzett ezúttal is. Ugyanolyan fifikás kis játék, mint a többi Feld játék. De megint új játékmechanizmusok vannak benne, és azok is olyan furcsán, különlegesen vannak kombinálva.

Annyi biztos, hogy mindenképpen gémer játék. Ahhoz túl összetett, hogy non-gamer-ekkel érdemes legyen elővenni.

The blind bidding somewhat annoys me. Also I find playing this a little tedious. You have to basically think your whole game thru to be sure to fulfill your task cards. Lose one crucial bidding and it's impossible to fulfill a task card. Can create endless AP for that reason.

Task cards are insanely difficult to fulfill. Do not keep them all like you would in, let's say, Ticket to ride. :)

Miracle upon miracle, another Feld game that I enjoy! The number is growing so fast I may have to stop telling people I dislike Feld games. The truth is there is a very specific type of Feld game that I enjoy, and Strasbourg fits the template. What Feld has going for him is attention to detail. Love him or hate him, you can't deny that he sweats the details -- a trait you'll appreciate as soon as you find a game that clicks with you. Where he runs into trouble is when he mistakes that attention to detail for an interesting game system.

Strasbourg is an auction game at its core, and Feld elaborates on the basic mechanic in his typical fashion: by making the scoring system broad and intricate. There are many ways to score points (or at least it appears so at first blush), and it won't be immediately obvious what is most valuable. However, there are two reasons that Strasbourg is a cut above Feld's other offerings. Unlike another of Feld's auction games,[thing=66505][/thing], there is no hidden deck of scoring cards. Nearly all of the various scoring opportunities are depicted on the board so you can evaluate what is important right from the start. The only exceptions are the end-game objective cards, but I'll get to those in a second. So far so typical. Lots of Feld games, from Trajan to Bora Bora, do this. What those games lack, however, is focus.

Strasbourg bucks the trend. Most importantly, Feld doesn't overdo it with scoring opportunities, or scoring "stations." You get points in three ways: getting workers in the village, getting workers up on a shield, or completing your end-game objectives. Workers on the shields are temporary and score every round. Workers in the village score at the end of the game. There are a few ways to increase the value of workers in the village (and those ways should not be ignored!), but those extras build on top of an existing system instead of developing entirely new systems, which would in turn compete for your attention (this latter fault is why Trajan can be so overwhelming: all those different point stations!). Finally, end-game objectives score points, and yes those are hidden, but they don't drive the game. What they do is add variety from game to game to ensure the board doesn't play out the same way each time.

All this and I haven't even discussed the bidding system, which is a lot of fun! It sort of reminds me of the set bids from Ra. Sort of. What you have is a deck of bidding cards. Each round you select some number of cards randomly from your deck, and then form those into potential bids. Whatever you lay out for the round is what you are stuck with. And it's a once-around bid, so you better think about what you really want to win. Personally, I love once-around auctions (when they're done right), so Feld's elaboration is a winner.

Overall, Strasbourg is a solid Feld game that benefits from his ability to string together intricate systems. I look forward to future plays.

This Stefan Feld game will require more plays in order to get a handle on it.  I am a fan of Feld, and Strasbourg has a lot going on.  There are lots of auctions, both to get stuff and to sell it,  Each player can implement there own unique strategy from the beginning, which is a lot to take in on the first play.

Elegant straight rules without any event- action- or other cards manipulating the game rules.
After one play I find the game a little unforgiving - you'll need a plan for your final goals straightaway - but still a great gamers game!

RATING: 6
I liked this well enough - I tend to like bidding/auction games to begin with, and this one has some interesting twists. The bonus goal cards are very challenging, if not balanced, and the auctions really require some planning. However, while the variation on blind bidding is interesting and works well, Strasbourg is terribly abstract, I'll happily play this and even look forward to doing so, but the game is so abstract it's dry as the desert. May need to play this once more to lock in a final rating, but I'm fairly sure it's not a game that I need to own.

A Feld game the seems a bit like his others but then again quite different. Eventhough it is a thought provoking game, it feels somewhat lighter. The atmosphere is changed a bit when playing this game over, say, In the Year of the Dragon, or Macao. I like it but it fits a lighter mood situation.

Really good bidding game that involves claiming properties in patterns for endgame scoring. All the while, you need to worry about your economy too. It takes a fine balance to do both, not to mention all while competing with the rest of the players doing the same.

RATING: 7
I like a good portion of the gameplay, but I'm not certain about the balance of the bonus cards and the randomness related to zigging when others are zagging.  I've seen some pretty fluky plays that make me question the chaos level, including three players coincidently needing to win the same single auction in the last round, and a player winning a last round auction with a bid of one.

Worth playing again after 5 plays, but this rating may go down.

Not one of my favorites from one of my favorite designers. The bidding mechanism is quite innovative, but the results of this semi-blind system can be quite swingy. Acquiring a key location to fulfill a task card can come down to being a dollar short in a blind bid.

A really good auction game with many possibilities. How great is to basically be sure to take what you want? You only need to take more cards. Ah, sure, you will be out sooner, and everyone else will gain things cheaper because you are no longer a factor in the auctions, but hey, you did get what you wanted, right? But at what cost? Well, the game can lead to some AP (taking the cards, sorting them in stacks, and so forth) - however this didn't happened and I like [b]Strasbourg[/b] quite a bit.

Looking foward for more plays!

Difficult to accomplish the goals from the cards you choose, and hard to know how to set up your bidding stack. I like the game because it presents a realm of complexity that may take a while to discover. Each round, it is most important to have a bid higher than other players to get what you absolutely need. Any other victories are icing on the cake. I want to play more of this.

The task cards feel somewhat poorly implemented - they have a huge impact for something you have to work with from the beginning of the game and can have little control over due to luck or chaos.  It feels like playing Ticket to Ride with 10 tickets to start and no way to ever get new ones.

That said, the other mechanics are solid, and lead to a tense & enjoyable experience.

One game, provisional rating.  Interesting hybrid of auction and blind bidding.. Suffers in contrast with Ra, in which the players also have a set number of fixed bids, though open, in that losing an auction is more harmful, and winning an auction is more random.

Interesting combination of restricted bidding (with a clever splitting / allocation mechanic), resource management, secret tasks, and spatial gameplay (placing workers on the main board).

It's a [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/4958/stefan-feld]Stefan Feld[/url] game.  Playing a Stefan Feld game is like trying a new flavor of soft serve.  There's capacity for a small surprise, but you already know whether you're going to like it before you try it.

This particular soft serve comes with auctions that involve splitting up your cards into groups to try to win things.  It's not exceptionally innovative, but it works _just_ _so_ in that way that Feld is so good at. Combine it with lots of small decision points, and you have the "everybody scores within 10 points of each other" Euro that gets lots of people so jazzed.

(May 2012 after 1 5p game) - Auctions with a twist, many times 2nd and 3rd place get a benefit.   The hidden end game victory cards are tough to gauge on your first play, but go with it.   Plays quick and felt unique.  Look forward to getting more plays of this one.

If someone made a board game designer make a game with area control and bidding, this is probably the best possible version of it. I mean I hate both those things yet I still like this game it's so unique and well put together. Yet I think ultimately I will not want to play it because it's still swingy at the end, has accidental kingmaking and all that stuff I really hate. This is my opinion after one play, and I'd like to give it one more go, and after that I'll probably be willing to play it but I will be looking for alternatives when this comes up because it's stressful and stuff due to those mechanisms. But really, Feld is a genius, no doubt, this is just not my genre.

the game flow is ok but there's nothing very exciting about this game. There is an original mechanic of preparing yourself to fight over a certain number of auctions with a small decks of cards. For this, the game earns .3 points from me.
Components are good, the rythm is fast, but the theme is completely disconnected from the rest and it doesnt help much in undestanding what you are doing.
Not a bad game at all but it didnt manage to grab me in any way. I could play it again and my rating could grow with time.

Economic game of influence over the craftsman guilds heavily centered around winning auctions by judicious bidding from identical decks of prestige value cards. Largely an area control strategy over the different guild factions. Hidden objectives give bonuses for controling certain patterns or combinations of the city guild area. The area control thing is too abstract for me. Why does it matter if I get control of an L-shaped block of armorer guild buildings?  The theme seems a bit pasted on.

This is a fast, agonizing auction game — but probably not like any other you've ever played.  There will be 35 auctions over the course of the game, and you have 24 cards you can use to try to win them.  What a start!

At the start of each of the five rounds, you draw as many cards as you like (looking at each as you draw it).  Then, you group them into bids, aware of the seven auctions coming, but not what your opponents are willing to bid on the "items".  Your winnings can include point-scoring (and possibly privilege-garnering) seats on the council, items to sell, plots of land to buy, opportunity to sell items (the [b]only[/b] way to generate cash), and control over beside whose people the point-scoring chapel or edifice are built, depending on the auction.  All this is fueled not only by the direct points they provide, but also by the 1-5 task cards you kept at the beginning of the game.  Like [thing=9209][/thing], you are rewarded for success, and punished for failure.  Unlike [thing=9209][/thing], failure scores you -3 points, regardless of how large — or small — the task's reward was.  It still stings.

Timing your best bids — or more over, [b]sufficient[/b] bids — for those crucial auctions, and remaining open to scarf up the unexpectedly less-desired items is a fun bit o' agony, especially as you mow through your paltry deck of 24 cards (values 1-6).

Interesting take on a euro from Feld.  (Can you tell I like Feld?  I have about five of his games I think.)  The odd thing here is the game uses a Ticket to Ride mechanic at the beginning of the game which sets your path in terms of strategy.

Simple explanation: It's a euro with multiple paths to victory where you sort of have to pick your path before the first turn.

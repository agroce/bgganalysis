RATING: 7
A nicely designed drafting and tile laying game that manages to feel breezy and pleasant while playing, with just enough bells and whistles to make gamers happy, while at the same time keeping the rules fairly simple for non-gamers.  And the theme (are those pictures of Warsaw buildings?) is kind of fun in a quirky, homegrown way.   While not particularly groundbreaking in its design, this game nevertheless deserves a wider audience for its accessibility and general gaming fun.

Fun light city-builder. We've had some runaway winners and some very tense games. The economy building, different tile-type, and war aspects all add up to an interesting game. There are variable strategies that can be employed, but you'll need to be flexible, as a strategy's effectiveness needs support from the tile draw and draft. I prefer this over Quadropolis in a vacuum.

RATING: 7.5
TLDR; Great little tile drafting optimalization puzzle. Clean, simple rules but engaging gameplay. Can be a bit AP-prone at times. Sturdy components and great storage inlay.

This is the best tile-based city building game I have played to date. As a reference I have played "Between Two Cities", "Castles of Mad King Ludwig", "Suburbia", "Quadropolis". But it beats most other tile-laying games that come to mind.

Why I like this more than comparable games is the freedom of choices you have. No single mechanic is particularly original, but this is a well designed package with clean and simple rules.

You play six rounds. On the end of a round you 'score' your city through a fixed set of rules (set collection). Scoring means money and/or VP's. Each round consists of drafting 4 tiles and after each draft you choose to pay the building cost (in a 4x3 grid) or discard the tile for three coins. After six rounds, the one with the most VP's wins. Simple enough.

Interesting addtitional mechanics are:
1) You can build over another tile. This lowers the building cost by the value on the tile being overbuilt.
2) After each round a milestone bonus tile can be won.
3) Bonus buildings that add extra scoring rules or other advantages.
4) After round 3 & 4 you have to discard tiles due to World War 1 & 2 causing havoc.

Each round has a fixed set of tiles. Tiles start out relatively simple and get more complex (and expensive). This progression smoothens play and also allows for planning after repeated plays. (The theme here is that each round reflects a period in time. Things like public transport only appear in the later rounds.)

Graphics are nice and clear and iconography is adequate for the most part (round order is missing visual cues and some bonus buildings need extra explaining, but there's a reference in the rule book).

Bardzo ciekawa gra kafelkowa o budowie dzielnic w Warszawie. Ciekawy mechanizm draftu zaczerpnięty z 7 cudów, konieczność burzenia budynków/kafelków podczas wojny, przejrzyste i spójne zasady (np. dodatkowe punkty za parki przy dzielnicach mieszkalnych, ujemne punkty za obszary przemysłowe) - to wszystko sprawia, że gra się bardzo przyjemnie, ale nie jest to trywialna gra. Jedna z najlepszych wyprasek, jakie miałam okazje zobaczyć. Przystępna cena i wysoka regrywalność.

Bought at Essen 2016 and already played 6 Times. 7 Wonders drafting mechanism of district tiles associated with à big Sim City gameplay feeling to it. The gameplay is simple but neat. Different ways of scoring and a good feeling of achieving a real City at the end even if you loose. The graphics are solid and the game puts you through the evolution of Warsaw. Scales well with 3-4 Players but I prefer it with 2.

Every win so far has been with the "gain 2 points for overbuilding" tile. I need to assume I'm not going to get it if it's not in my initial hand and then come up with a max VP strategy, as I'm unsure if it's imbalanced.

Tile drafting and placing in a Sim City world. Very good game. I like the artwork of the `regular' tiles with residential areas etc. that remind me of Sim City. With each epoch, new details like cars appear. However, the public buildings and milestones do not really fit to them due to the different perspective.

The small tweak here, of adjacent same-color areas all counting as one district (this is good in some cases and bad in others), made this stand out from every other five-color city-building game I played in November (you know the drill: don't put industrial next to housing, parks are worth 1/3/6/10 points for 1/2/3/4...). And by stand out I mean those other games bored and angered me while this was pretty fun.

Also, limiting your city's area to 3x4 tiles is a fun constraint, though I won in part by getting the "you can go up to 4x4" special tile, so maybe my opponents didn't enjoy that constraint as much.

This one bored me from the start. I hoped for some interesting play while we got the game explained, but there was just nothing.

Draft some tiles, pay to put them down and try to get adjacency bonuses (which is just a coin or point...), or scrap one to get 3 coins.

This is just a very boring mix of "7 Wonders" (drafting) and any city tile laying game without any depths.

One of the First games I played at Essen 2016 and I immediately had to own it. Really enjoyed it 2 players. A tile laying game that is quick to setup and tear down thanks to the fab insert. Nice artwork on the building tiles and clear graphic design and iconography. Elegant and seemingly simple gameplay but plenty of tough choices to make. about just the right amount of interaction as you draft tiles and compete for milestone but it never feel cutthroat if you lose out.

It's a poorly written rulebook for one thing... it kinda feels like it's simultaneously trying to scratch the itch of 7 Wonders and also Suburbia (as odd a combo as that sounds). The scoring is interesting, but much much less thematic than Suburbia

You still get points for residential buildings next to parks yada yada yada... but I must breakup my residential areas to maximise scoring. It also feels on parr with suburbia in terms of complexity, but not in terms of depth or quality of mechanics.

Reminds me of Between Two Cities/7 Wonders in the drafting city/building mechanism, although there is a lot less interaction between your neighboring players and the game only plays up to 4 players.

Each age, four tiles are drafted and are ether immediately built into your 3x4 tableau or discarded for money. Then there is a scoring round (mid-game, two scoring rounds begin with each player having to discard 1 then 2 tiles from their city) where money and points are awarded, as well as a bonus building. The tie breaker favors the player who is further behind.

When reading in the book about scoring, the book uses word-speak (ie: "commercial building" while the player aid uses only iconography [yellow building]. It would have been easier to figure out the scoring if the iconography was included in the text description of scoring. Also the symbol for money and victory points were mixed up between the players a few times because they are both a silver-shape with a number on top.
Still, it's only a small hurdle (the scoring summary makes sense) and the game played very quickly.

I love this game, it's one of my favorites right now and my go-to city builder. Love the way it ramps up, the first three epochs fly by and then the decisions get tougher and you start paying attention to the tile drafting and what you are passing on to others.  You have to stick to a 3x4 or 4x3 Grid so choosing when and how to overbuild (stack) tiles is critical. Everyone I've introduced this to has enjoyed it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Enjoy this tile drafting/laying game where you are building a 4x3 grid (or in one case, possibly a 4x4) and score money or points based on where different types of buildings are placed. The removal of tiles from WWI and WWII is annoying but makes one consider a bit more about one's construction choices. Curious to try this one again although I need to print out some more player aids to help with translating the public buildings special abilities.

Capital is a perfect combination of two mechanics- tile placement and draft. We score points for many things and we have a lot of ways to achieve victory. The tiles (for the most part) are different from each other and have an interesting combination of districts printed on them. Over a dozen of them have special abilities that give us additional money, points or reduces cost of one kind of districts. There’s climatic mechanic of World War that forces us to destroy one or two our tiles at the end of fourth and fifth epoch. This variety makes this game very enjoyable.

Interesting city building game which does have a few weak points, such as the bonuses, which especially at the beginning can feel a bit random, with many players qualifying, but the tiebreaker deciding who gets the bonus. Generally a nice game with interesting choices, though.

After a second game I have to conclude it's just not my game. I don't like the flow, and I really don't like the bonus tiles, or rather how they're awarded.

Really wanted to like this game, but it suffers from too much "Luck of the draw" when it comes to the draft.  In nearly ever play of this game, we've known who was going to win it by the middle of the game, and it's normally a blow out win.  Not always the same person, not always the same way.   Basically the game goes on for 6 rounds, with the winner determined by round 3 or 4.  So my question is, why are we playing more than 3 or 4 rounds?

Ooooh...I like this game. It's competing with Quadropolis. I like that I can build on top of buildings; I like the restriction of the 3x4 grid; I like that buildings get destroyed during WWI & WWII.

I like that when you build on top of older buildings the price is the difference between the two buildings. In general, the ways the different building types score feels balanced. This game is difficult to find. I'm so glad I found a used copy in great condition. 

The only thing that annoys me is that it comes with 3 player aides, even though it's for 2-4 players. Seriously, who thought that was a good idea? Also, there's a tile that allows a player to build their district up to a 4x4 grid, which seems slightly overpowered. If I could remove that tile from the game and instead have a 4th player aide, the game would be perfect.

[b]Capital[/b] was sold via auction 11/18/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8/10):[/COLOR]

[i]I waffled on picking this up, but in the end decided to get a copy knowing how much my son and I enjoy city building games, specifically Suburbia. While Suburbia isn't a long game, I was interested in Capital because it seemed to offer a somewhat similar play experience to Suburbia in about half the time. A typical game of Suburbia hovers around an hour hour and we can get in a game of Capital in thirty minutes. Of course quick doesn't always mean good, but Capital delivers. 

Our first game was a bit bumpy because we were counting individual sections for some of the scoring instead of overall areas. Once that was cleared up we sailed through the rest of our plays. The rules are good overall, I especially appreciate the last couple of pages which list all the different monuments and special buildings and explain what they do. It makes it very easy to reference during the game. The iconography on the tiles is clear and consistent and the artwork has grown on me [i](it looks much better in person)[/i]. 

I really enjoy the game play, turns play out similar to 7 Wonders: you draft a tile from a handful and then pay money to play it into your tableau. You can discard a tile for money and you can also build over a tile by paying the difference in cash. This is important because you are confined to a 4x3 or 3x4 grid which adds a nice level of constraint as you try and optimize the placement of each tile. I really enjoy that design choice in games. There is a lot more going on in the game with special buildings and monuments which give special abilities or different scoring opportunities and tile destruction between rounds three and four due to WWI and WWII; great mechanic. 

Needless to say I really like Capital and how much game it manages to pack into a short playtime. There is a lot of tension in the game because you need to manage your income, keep your city confined to a certain grid size and then you are going to most likely destroy three or more of your tiles over the course of the game. Hopefully this game will see wider distribution, it is that good. The designer managed to craft a brilliant design using mechanics from other games and blending them together seamlessly. Capital would fire Suburbia from my collection, but it is one of my son's favorite games.[/i]

The mechanics and cards of this game simulate the growth of city very well: you see your city growing, changing and modernizing when playing through the different rounds. The drafting mechanic works well. In my opinion the game is a little more interesting when playing with two, because you can better plan ahead. Only downside is the replayability: besides the goals everything is the same every game. This could definitely use an expansion with some more tiles. Otherwise great game.

RATING: 8
This is a short city building game where each round players draft tiles and at the end of the round a powerful bonus tile gets assigned to the player who best met it's criteria based on what and how they built. The game is incredibly interesting, because the building grid is only 4x3, but the game allows you to build on top of previously placed tiles, only paying the difference in cost. The tricky scoring element is that each round, only one park scores for each adjacent red area around it, so it's challenging to snake the park around while trying to break the reds into different sections so they don't all count as one.

I'm not sure if I'm sold on this game however. Everything so far I've told you has been fantastic, but there are special buildings throughout the draft that can be extremely powerful. It'a also important to note that while the buildings have english text on them, the text can be misleading as to what the building actually does, according to the rulebook. The buildings are all listed there, (but not in alphabetical order) but going into the draft you might not know to look something up, when it seems clear based on what's written on the tile. I resorted the info, added the rules answers and uploaded a quick lookup sheet to the BGG file section I hope people find helpful.

The overall is I like a lot of what's happening in this game, but I need a few more plays to know if the buildings that seem too powerful, really are too powerful. It's ambiguous, because when building space is so tight in this game, losing the ability to utilize a whole tile spot, actually is a remarkable downside.

It doesn't do anything unique, but it does do a lot of familiar things very well. I'd like to see an expansion take more chances in the future, but I'm happy playing this as a light city-building drafting game. Recommended.

Straightforward, quick, challenging, but enjoyable game of city-building and rebuilding (specifically of the city of Warsaw) by tile placement. Reminiscent of several other games, including, most recently Quadropolis, but definitely worth getting in its own right. Very good production values (including excellent box insert) with an informative rulebook. And in the UK at least, it's very, very good value for money.

Interesting fun drafting + city-building game with a variety of possible strategies and tactics to discover. We found it addictive fun, and it's relatively quick to play. We've had some close games won by tiebreaker, and some blowouts. Enjoyable diverse replay value.

Also, the more you play, the more you notice that some people's initial impressions about "tile X is overpowered" are not necessarily true. :)

Note: We worked on the English translation.

Great 'palate-cleanser' or 'warm up' game. I played this at a 'try the new stuff from Essen'-style mini-con and enjoyed it quite thoroughly. It is puzzly enough to provide interesting choices and some agonizing optimization challenges, but simple enough that it is easy to learn and does not lend itself to heavy analysis paralysis.

This game is lovely! City building game a bit like quadropolis, the drafting makes for some light interaction and the whole thing is very smooth and puzzley.

One-pl;ay rating... felt a lot like Fields Of Green/Among the Stars, but has a more interesting puzzle (to me, anyway) of trying to make sure everything fits inside a 3x4 block while keeping certain sections together and other sections apart. The city-building reminded me a bit of Quadropolis, too. I'd rather play this than either of those now.

This is a city building tile drafting game. I liked how it had a bit more theme as the city you are building is based on Warsaw and will be influenced by WW1 and WW2. The game would be great gateway game into drafting and city building. I prefer this game to Quadropolis as I prefer the tile drafting mechanic to Quadropolis' picking a tile based on number.

tl;dr: average city building game

Tile laying city building games usually go on my radar. So did this game. In this case it combines drafting with the tile laying.
It works fine. The different elements of the city score in their own distinct way, leading to nice choices to be made, and unique buildings with special abilities spice things up a bit more.
I think, depending on what tiles you get, different strategies are probably possible, but one play is too early to say for sure.
But in the end it works fine but doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, in better games.

Initial rating: 6.5/10
BGG scale: 6/10

Good map building game. Has a Suburbia feel but much lighter. Having to lose some tiles due to war is interesting. I'd like to play again to explore some of the abilities of the special tiles.

This is a pretty good city builder.  Having to remove tiles because of the two wars and the abilities to overbuild offer an interesting efficiency puzzle.  There are several valid routes to victory.  I wish there were some extra tiles in each era to create some more variety.  Interestingly, 2 player can be a little more unpredictable since half the tiles don't see play.  The mermaids scoring tokens are pretty delicate with the swords easily snapped off.

Essen 2016. Interesting city building game where you draft tiles (7 Wonders style) to build your city within a 4*3 grid. You can overbuild tiles from previous rounds. Different strategies seem possible. Pleasantly surprised by a game that pretty much flew under my radar until a few days before Essen. The people I played with were with us in Essen, they now regret not having bought it :-)

I was a little worried that this would be redundant with Between Two Cities because they look almost identical (draft tiles, build a city, each type of building scores differently). I was pleasantly surprised to find that this game feels a lot different from B2C.

One thing that makes it feel different is the economy. There is no economy in B2C, you just hope to get the best tiles for your cities. In Capital you have to weigh the income and points you'll get from a tile versus the cost, while factoring in other things such as bonuses, milestones, and what your opponents are building.

Another thing is the spatial aspect. B2C has a very light spatial aspect, where you want to build so that you'll get the most points. Capital is more involved because you build "areas" of contiguous tiles, and you want these areas to touch in different ways. You want a large park area that touches many smaller residential areas, you want commercial buildings to touch residential areas, you want your bus stops to be scattered around the city and not adjacent, etc.

The last thing is the "ability" tiles. Some buildings in Capital give you discounts, bonus points, extra money, and so on. I like having these in the game because they add decisions beyond "which of these tiles will give me the most points right now?" It's more similar to 7 Wonders where you have to consider long-term benefits versus straight points/money.

Unfortunately Capital makes no effort to cater to the colorblind. The red and orange structures are identical except for their color, and some of the other colored buildings have the same issue. It would have been easy to add a symbol or at least make the art of the buildings look different. I'm only moderately colorblind and I actually don't have any issues with the game, but I can see it being an issue for some.

Update: After a few more plays I'll be getting rid of Capital. While the game itself is not bad, it seems like there can be a runaway leader issue. If someone gets a good lead early then they just have to maintain throughout the rest of the game. The last round or two is often anticlimactic because you can look at the scoreboard and see that there is almost no way to catch the leader. The shoddy production (not colorblind friendly, same illustrations) was also a factor in selling the game.

Very cool city building game. Tile drafting works like a charm here. Capital offers many decisions in a short time and with very few rules. Highly recommended, it's a lovely family game (though I'm sure more experienced players will enjoy this one a lot as well).

Tile draft and placement city builder of boroughs in Warsaw over six epochs from 16th century to present impacted by two World Wars.  Many engaging features; I like the small 3x4 footprint that constrains expansion and causes a thinky mix of maxing tile adjacency rules, weighing tight income, when to hate trash tiles, long term planning to claim the bonus cultural site tiles. I also like the dynamic of destroying tiles as war damage, and overbuilding is one of my favorite city builder mechanics.  Lastly, the escalation of the progression of tiles through the six stages.

Very nice maps and wonderful counters. Too complicated for what one obtains in the end. Scenarios not balanced, and one out of scale. I don't like having units continually coming back after being desrupted. I still prefer the old Napoleon Last Battles games.

Chit pull activation system is what makes this game, along with interesting mix of battles covered. Raab being one of my favourites.

RATING: 9
Based on the Jours de Gloire series which are slightly better games physically in most ways.  I am very fond of both systems.  The difference is really only in about three rules.  Physically the games play a little differently.  Still, if you know one version the other is nothing to pick up.  Over 20 games now using the same system.  They play very well with a good feel for the Napoleonic battlefield.  

Edit: Recently, Steve and I played the Austerlitz scenario and we enjoyed it so much that I have upped my rating from 8 to 9.  My appreciation for this system just continues to grow.

Nice, relatively straightforward system that is similiar to the Glory series of Civil War games. Excellent graphics, as usual for GMT games, but unfortunately uses 1/2" counters in place of Glory's 5/8" counters.

RATING: 8
(2007-10-31) Fairly good balance between playability and "realism".  The system is not to difficult to learn and plays fast.  Some may not like the chit pull driven turn sequence but I am Okay with it.

RATING: 7
Un système intéressant comparable à Jours de Gloire mais avec plus d'aléatoire. Le système convient mieux aux grosses batailles qu'aux petits engagements.

RAAB - très bon scénario d'initiation. C'est le joueur autrichien qui a le rôle le plus intéressant à jouere même si sa situation est vraiment désespérée.
CASTIGLIONE - non jouée.
AUSTERLITZ - les Austro-Russes feront mieux que dans la réalité en utilisant judicieusement leur artillerie et en freinant leurs assauts. Un très bon scénario avec néanmoins un net avantage aux Français.
ESSLING - une bataille peu palpitante même si c'est la plus équilibrée de la boîte. Les combats se résument à de trop nombreux jets de dé autour d'Essling et d'Aspern. L'usure des troupes finira par faire craquer l'un ou l'autre des deux camps...Mais que c'est long pour y parvenir!
WAGRAM - un engagement monstrueux avec de la manoeuvre. Très excitant en début de partie, le joueur autrichien se rendra vite compte que sa situation est sans espoir, la faute à Davout qui bouge trop rapidement sur la carte et qui écrasera dans tous les cas la gauche autrichienne dès le premier jour des combats. Pour empêcher cela, supprimer les règles de marche forcée.

This is an excellent game system with lots of color, great maps and counters, and a complexity level that is not too tough. The version 2.0 rules are a must. I have raised my rating to 8, the latest rules really improve the game. Highly recommended.

A very nice game. Quick play and full of actions. It is better than a lot of other Nappy tactical/battle games, in which the paces of battle are slow.

RATING: 8
Very interesting system--find the chit-pull sequencing of actions enjoyable (injects additional unpredictability).  Decent counter graphics (though some of the colors do not occur in nature).  Recommend giving it a try.
Some order of battle adjustments needed at Wagram and Aspern.
Battle of Raab is a good introduction to the system (and a battle that deserves more attention from gamers).

Not a bad game, but I found that the old warhorses like Nap at Leigzig are more fun and more importantly give a better impression of Nap's battles than this one. Too many fiddly bits weaken the illusion for me.

RATING: N/A
Out of the box you get the battles of Castigilone, Austerlitz, Raab, Aspern-Essling and Wagram. The quality of the components are very high and consistent with the follow-game of Borodino. 

Once get around to printing the living rules to Borodino, I'm going to slip it into this box as the Triumph & Glory II ruleset supercedes the earlier rules. 

A casual glance through the rules convinced me that the game system is very quick to pickup so much so that I'm now on the hunt for the Glory system that focuses on the ACW. 

Nice thing about these battles they range from one mappers to two mappers without the very high counter densities of similar games. The random activation mechanic certainly brings the fog of war into how these battles developed. From the perspective of solitarie play it's very nice indeed.

RATING: 6
a game about Napoleon that tries to show the vagaries of Napoleonic command and the ways they fought their battles with a fairly simple system. I think this is just great! Included are the battles of Wagram, Aspern-Essling, Raab, Austerlitz           and Castiglione.

It's very quick and simple, and the simplicity have made some oddness creep into the system. Units with a TQ of 10 is near impossible to break and will steamroll opponents whatever they do. But, the old guard are handled that way in many more "realistic" games as well, so maybe it's how it is.

Nice Napoleonic flavour with a minimum of rules.

Richard Berg on Napoleonics.  Practically he simulates everything and every war period. The system is later evolved into Jour de Gloire system, which became very popular among the Napoleonic enthusiasts.

Nice graphics, and I like chitpull tactical games. Unfortunately, the attempt to make the chitpulls double for command control with multiple impulses per hour makes the game very fiddly and slower than one would think.  The combat system gets rather deterministic round the edges and the rubber routers are here again.  In the end, the Napoleonic flavour  was just overwhelmed by the overintricacy.   Less history than Eagles of the Empire at several times the effort.

Playtester for Aspern-Essling. Colorful with good cavalry rules. Not as detailed as La Bataille.  I would put it 3rd after La Bat & Vive L'Empereur systems.

RATING: 6
relatively easy to learn and straightforward if you use the 2.2 Borodino rules. I quite like the command/activation system and how it interacts - through choices on which units to put under order - still the combat system is IMO way too random and the idea of getting back double disrupted units via a cohesion check is VERY odd. Misses the feeling of loses in combat somewhat. Considering that this is a Berg game the gamemasters series is certainly NOT fiddly. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So Berg it almost seems like self-caricature. Activation chits? Check. Cohesion rating? Check. Facing to hex vertex? Check. Lots and lot of modifiers? Check. Rubber routers? Check. Copious die rolling? CHECK.

The 2.0 rules have been tamed, thanks to Bill Ramsay's development work. Have played Raab, Castiglione, Austerlitz, and now Wagram and they are all entertaining enough. No command and control to speak of below the corps level, which means your divisions and brigades get to do whatever they want so long as they stay daisy-chained to each other. There's also no such thing as battle fatigue, so if you have a real hammer corps, like Davout at Wagram, you place them Under Orders on turn 1 and keep them that way for the duration. In the big battles the major drag on play is resolving artillery fire, together with counter-battery fire and the inevitable cohesion checks that result. (I finally resorted to a house rule out of self preservation: on a natural 0 the artillery unit is out of ammo and out of the game.)

Also have the Lonato C3i 14 Lonato supplement.

Enjoyable system. Not too simple but not overwhelmingly fiddly. The rules from the later Borodino game should be used to avoid confusion. Just wish more games in this system had been published.

Ok, the first version was unplayable out of the box. Ok, the second edition rules are just not simply a collection of erratas, more like a complete rewrite of the original rules. Ok, maybe the game takes a little too long for what it is. Still it is a great tactical game with tough choices and the fastest napoleonic system I've ever tried, without losing too much chrome in the process. An underrated game, for sure.

I've finally got this on the table. There's over 1000 small counters covering 5 battles but one of the scenarios is relatively small. I was warned that I'd need the 2.2 rules from the GMT website and these have seemed pretty clear so far.

I've only soloed this. Looks like the usual underdeveloped fiddle-fest from Richard Berg. But the new rules version 2.2 seem to be a significant improvement. The Napoleonic tactics theme is a big hook for me. So may try again, or may EBay it, haven't decided yet.

RATING: 8
Very complicated to review; the 1ed rules were terrible.  The 2ed are quite good.  Get them.  The scenarios are typical Bergian fare: historical, colorful...and totally unbalanced.  But the basic game engine works for every scenario, except perhaps Aspern where the scale inhibits things.  Austerlitz and Wagram are great...but Austerlitz is a French walk anyway you slice it.  Get Borodino, that's a winner.

I like the scale of the game - you can have nice battle on a half map. The overall command & movement rules are pretty simple, but combat is rather involved (the bulk of the total 14 pages of rules). The game packs a lot of counters and maps in the smallish box. Overall too fiddly and slow to play for something that was supposed to be a "gameplayers game".

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Nice system, according to the level of complexity that remains moderate while retaining some taste of Napoleonic battles. Becomes better with the v 2.0 rules. Works even with large battles, a good point for Wagram amateurs. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rubberband routers and command system a bit shaky. Would like more leadership rules as well, but a good system overall. 

I've played Castiglione, and though prospects are dismal for the Austrians, it's an interesting study in a fighting withdrawal. Getting those troops off the map given the way orders work (or do not work in the case of the Austrians) is tough! Raab is a little more even-handed, and another good study, but the French reinforcements will overrun the Austrians in my experience.

Played Austerlitz recently. You get a nice feel for this battle, although I am wondering why I almost never use my cavalry to charge. The rules seem to discourage it too much; or I have a very wrong impression of how often cavalry charged in those days.

Beautiful and quite enjoyable. Nevertheless, the scale is somewhat disapointing : the game always hesitates over tactical and operationnal options. Something between KZ's games and "la bataille" (CoA) but unable to satisfy the real amateurs of the emperor who appreciate the flavor of these games.

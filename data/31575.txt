Great PS3 CCG game. It's a shame you can't get the cards any more and there isn't more support for the game through Sony: a few simple patches / expansions (for example, a single player campaign mode) and they would have had a real winner on their hands.

It's fun.  I'm looking forward to picking up some theme decks and messing around with it a bit more.

RATING: 8
What a surprise!  The whole optical card recognition plus deck construction plus Battle Chess animations seemed like such a gimmick, but it works!  The underlying game is very well done.  An excellent combination of CCG mechanics plus board game positioning (your creatures have facing and can only attack in certain directions).  Won't appeal to the majority of video gamers for whom this is definitely too "static", but for boardgamers and CCG gamers this is a real treat!  Yes, it's collectible and thus expensive if you want to have every possible card in your library, but even with just the included starter and a few boosters you can have a lot of fun plus the computer can play the pre-constructed decks against you and you don't even have to own them!

Still kind of iffy on this one.. most of my games tend to be decided more on luck of the draw than any decision made by either player.. hoping the second set changes this.  The theme decks have so far managed to override my hatred of collectible games.

Boardgame? Magic for the console generation? Not sure what to classify this as. It's an ok game but a bit too slow and graphical for me.

RATING: 7
Surpisingly clever card based videogame, you use the PS3 camera to read cards played on a battlemat, the cards then have their own battle animations that are played out on the tv screen, it works very well, although some cards are hard for the camera to read in less than perfect light. Its a clever game and the AI is well optimised to give you a ruthless game.

My favorite PS3 video game and one of my favorite card games ever.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A cracking game as it stands, but with the addition of the PS3 it really comes alive. Online play is great, its easy to find an opponent and it really feels like the comunity spirit of the tournament scene. If there could be more info on players and plays (statistics) and an organized tourney scene it would easily be the best CCG ever.

Very fun ccg + area control game.  Too bad they stopped supporting it on the PS network.

RATING: 7
A fun enough game that literally brings the monsters on the cards to life. It is just a shame that it takes up so much space. The required setup is also expensive and the official cards are almost impossible to find. Not to mention how easy it is to "cheat" with fake cards.

Sony has since discontinued print of the cards. I have most from Set 1 and Set 3 and am looking for a Set 2 booster box.

A great game with some good looking cards. Some sets are definitely better than others.

I'm not very good at this yet, but it seems nicely balanced for a collectible card game.  The CPU is very strong, even at the lowest AI setting.  A deck of commons/uncommons stands as good a chance against anyone, I think, because the high-powered cards are very difficult to get on to the table. If you like board games and own a PS3, I think this game is a must have.  Hint: turning off the battle animations cuts the play time in half.

If you have a Playstation 3 and enjoy card games, this is a must-have. The initial offering of augmented reality with cards coming to life onscreen drew me into the game initially. However, the depth of gameplay mechanics and multifaceted deck construction was what really kept me coming back for more.

While the camera may be finnicky at times, it can be quickly and easily remedied with a clip-on LED light for a Kindle, which I found for $2.50 at a local bookstore.

Unfortunately, the collectible nature of the cards and niche audience resulted in its ultimate discontinuation. I still enjoy games offline with my friends and family.

This sure was a nice surprise! It's deep enough to be challenging, it's very entertaining, it requires the right amount of thought and hey, the PlayStation Eye is a wonder - it reads the cards in a split sec. Thumbs up!

Played at Gen Con UK. Really enjoyed my two games and was impressed with how well it played considering the small card pool available. The cards are not the run of the mill simple starter cards with no abilities of many new CCG's. There are shades of Anachronism, Zoon and, obviously Yu Gi Oh. Mana is cumulative and there is a cost to change orientation or attack once a card is on the grid. Seeing the cards animated is excellent, but not essential to the game. Rating is 7 for gameplay, would be a 9 for presentation.

RATING: 5
Certainly a novel concept but ultimately a gimmick that you will tire of quickly. The computer plays a strong game even against seasoned card gamers - more so than lots of the online people who seem to think a deck of dragons is the way to go. Ages ago MtG appeared as a PC game (before WoTC became too greedy) and this is that reinvented for the console generation with obvious graphical flair. OK for a while but don't expect too much.

RATING: 7
A nice surprise. This ccg makes you think as it isn't too easy, but instead quite tactical. 3x3 grid is also a smart idea that I liked. PS3 helps keep count of everything you would otherwise do with tokens or dice or something which is also nice. On the con side the PS3 and the nice animations slow down the game a bit.

A clever strategy game.  It uses the PS3 camera to "bring cards to life".  We saw this first at Gencon years ago, it would be a better game if the camera wasn't so picky.

The Eye of Judgment is a collectible card game which can be played using the PlayStation 3 platform, supported by the PlayStation Eye camera peripheral. It is one of the first games to use the peripheral. The trading cards are encrypted with a CyberCode matrix code.

The game can also be played without the use of the Playstation 3 system, as a stand-alone card game.

Very interesting game, the actual play is much more interesting than you would first think based on the cards, as you have to balance mana cost, health, attack, special abilities and elemental affiliation.  I do not think that you need all the rares or ultra rares to be competitive.

I recently picked this up for the PS3 and it is a really fun game. If you pickup the cards on ebay you can get almost a complete set of cards for around fifty dollars. Not a bad deal.

I think all of us that play CCGs have at one time or another wished the characters would come to life and battle on the table, a la the chess scene in STAR WARS.  Well, this is as close as we're going to get right now.  I've had trouble over time finding cards, but I snap up every pack I can find.  Now that my FNGS is stocking both boosters and decks, it's gotten a LOT easier (the owner is a fan of the game, so he stocks it).  I'm waiting for the second set to come out (out in Japan in March, supposedly), and will keep playing this as long as there is backing for it.

This is a pretty entertaining cross over "magic the gathering" type fast paced game where the cards you play on a six square field come to life through the magic of the PS3's eye toy and battle on your tv screen.There is real strategy and the animations are pretty good.  It's a lot of fun.

RATING: 6.5
I have an irrational love of this. Simultaneously ahead of its time and hopelessly archaic, this combo CCG/video game represents a path that gaming as a whole STILL hasn't explored and maybe never will (though the success of Skylanders and the upcoming app-driven XCOM might indicate that EOJ is more the former than the latter).

Oh man.  Remember when you first played Magic: the Gathering and you said "wouldn't it be cool if the monster cards were 3-D figures?"  And then you played Dreamblade and said "wouldn't it be cool if these 3-D figures actually started fighting each other?"  Have I got the game for YOU!  I actually bought a PS3 just so I could play this game and it did not disappoint.  I just wish the cards were a little easier to get ahold of.  Did that third set ever come out?

The only game I will comment on but haven't played. The music is noisy heavy metal and the sounds and narration are abysmally loud, obnoxious, and cliche. The animation and graphics are cliche and a waste of time. So you play a card, look up, wait forty second for the computer to waste your time, look down, play a card, look up, and repeat ad nauseum, all the while being assaulted in the ears and eyes. Spare me. And the technology is expensive, breakable, and overly specific.

A well designed CCG with a web cam that scans the board and reproduces 3D images onscreen for online play. Was lots of fun when new but like all CCGs the meta game just takes too long and as the game grew older, hyper optimized decks started to dominate and actually enjoying the game became difficult.

This is showing us all what trading card games will look like in the future. Right now, it's probably too early (too expensive, too slow, too much mess with the camera and the playstation 3 needed. But it's a good glimpse of things to come.

It is flat insulting that they expect you to pay $15 for the expansion software, and then buy cards on top of that before you can use it. The game itself had some (but not a ton) of potential.

this game was pretty good once i got the hang of it. however having to set up the camera near a table and then to relearn the rules everytime means im not ganna play this one much at all if ever again

This is a really well balanced game. Very good first effort for bringing CCGs to the Playstation 3. It's probably the only must have title for the PS3. Only problem is that your room has to be well lit for the camera to work.

Extremely cool, fairly unique type of game that successfully melds technology (PS3's Eye-Toy Webcam) with a surprisingly interesting CCG (that itself has some fairly innovative gameplay ideas).

They should've released a standalone tabletop version of the CCG to really keep this game going.  It was very good.

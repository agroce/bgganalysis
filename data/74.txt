Not terrible with the right group of people.  My family, for example, just tries to pair up the most disgusting, hilarious or inappropriate cards -- it's a riot.  I've played with others who play very seriously and w/o humor, in which case this game is more like torture.

My mind keeps changing on this one. It is in a word: classic. So yes, I do play it at times - it's just so easy to play while lying down or while being completely disinterested. Great party-style game without trivia, friendly and non-threatening, scales way up comfortably with large numbers of players. On the other hand, it's not really a game I long for as it feels rather silly - all fine when in the right party mood. Else, it sits on the shelf.

Has to be one of the easiest games in the world to understand.  Everyone enjoys it.  I have the first 2 expansions as well.  Next to Cranium, I'd say it was the best party game...but it's a lot quicker than Cranium.  If you want an easy party game that's a lot of fun then this is it, if you want something a little more challenging and varied, but just as daft, then I'd go with Cranium...but these are the best two of scores of Party Games that I've played.

(B&L Own) Reminds me of Say Anything, except less likely to pick a certain persons answer.

Solid party game. A lot depends on who you are playing with. With the right group this is light fast fun.

RATING: 7
A fun party game but as with all party games, heavily dependent on who you play with. Best played with people who won't take the answers too seriously and have a similar sense of humours. Doesn't work that well if you don't know the other players well.

(+) Everyone knows how to play, gets some good laughs, group interaction, voting, approachable, quick play time

I think the most interesting thing about this game is that when I play this game, the less I know about a person, the better I do.  I do wonderfully with people I have never met before.  And while I have never gotten the five cards needed to win, I'm usually in the top three before the game ends with three or four cards. It's all about the context - and the crazy leaps your mind can make.  I once gained the adjective "Mysterious" by playing the noun "Bear skin rug."  I love how seemingly random combinations can work so well in some situations but fail in others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The kids enjoy this, and I like the game enough when playing with them, so it earns maybe a 7 in that regard. I prefer Dixit for a game with winners determined by subjective judgment, though.

w/ first expansion deck (in shrink, unused). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I was sceptical it would go down well, after all, wheres the game?
But something about it really clicks with people and makes it a great game. Just the right length if played once, but you must be strict in taking it away after the first/second game since it will quickly outstay it's welcome. Brits: Get the British release, it comes in a ridiculously outsized box for a few cards, but is chocked with British cultural references.

I didn't think it would happen but I loathe getting this game out now - of course everyone loves it and I still highly recommend people pick it up, but eventually you, as the owner, will hate it.

RATING: 5
A great innovative word association game that belongs in many English class rooms and on family dinner tables. The funny word associations tend to trump the logical ones and this can make rational players who don't play to their judge frustrated. The game has fallen out of my favor as I have progressed more deeply into the board gaming hobby and developed a taste for more sophisticated games. Also, better clones like cards against humanity have come out which are defintely less kid friendly but more fun for the older less worried about vulgarity crowd.

RATING: 7
This is a great party game simply because it's so accessible while still being fun. 
Many are intimidated by the "time pressure/ extrovert" games (Taboo, Time's Up, Charades) and the "creative" games (Balderdash, Things...).  Compared to those games, anyone can get into Apples to Apples (young and old, social or shy). 
Personaly, I would choose "Time's Up" or "Things" over this one, but those just aren't going to work with every crowd, so I like having this around just in case. 

Edit: rating lowered from 8 to 7 because it hasn't had as much longevity as I hoped.

+ The game is easy to introduce to anyone and can accommodate virtually any size group.
- There really is no game in here. It's just an excuse to sit around and argue.


Why it's previously-owned:
When I play this, if we play past the first round, I feel like gouging out my eyes with a spoon.
I think I burned the cards and then threw them in the trash. We now know about much more fun party games, like Time's Up.

After a number of plays Apples to Apples has lost a bit of it's luster for me (moved from 8 to 7 now to 6).

A now-classic party game. Come up with the best (often humorous) conceptual match between the word cards in your hand and the round's chosen word/phrase.

RATING: 1
Democratic, not strategic. And, as was once said, the best argument against democracy is a five minute conversation with the average voter.

This is not even a game; it is basically a corporate icebreaker/team-building exercise. 

Its only redeeming feature is that you can quit at any time and it won't matter. 

For a party game that actually involves some skill, I'd suggest Scattergories (though it requires reasonable people as there is still an evaluation phase).

I got this based on all the hype plus the recommendation of a salesperson.  It didn't work with our group.  We didn't find it fun or funny.  Also, there were too many pop-culture references to make it appropriate for the whole age range.  For party games, we much prefer Taboo, (which unfortunately suffers from the lack of an expansion pack) or pictionary, or 'fictionary' -- a definition game that requires only a dictionary and some paper and pencils to play.

Argh, my sister got me to play this again at a party... and I ended up having a decent amount of fun.  If people explain why they like/dislike the submitted answers it can be pretty entertaining.  Guess I have to bump up the score to 4.
----------------------------
Apples to Apples is game for a larger group (5-10) that is predominantly interested in talking and/or drinking.   Given the entirely subjective nature of deciding the winning card in a given round, I find the game ranges from moderately funny to infuriating.  Certainly not a game to be taken seriously.

An instant hit with every non-gamer I've played with. Fun, simple party game that emphasizes interaction and laughes over strict rules.

RATING: 6
This is a well-chosen and entertaining set of word/concept cards in search of a game.  It's also somewhat US-centric: there was potential for it to be funnier if the importers to the rest of the English-speaking world had thought to replace some of (e.g.) the celebrity cards with people we'd heard of.

Fantastic party game with tremendous appeal.  Is able to accommodate groups of any type even if they are of different ages, tastes, or are not too well acquainted with one another.  Some people however may be turned off to random judges, and it doesn't help that some of the red apples are kind of lame.

[ESP] Un muy buen Party Game que jugado con el grupo correcto te hará morirte de la risa.

Consiste en 2 mazos de cartas: cosas y descripciones. 
Cada vuelta, el árbitro actual selecciona una descripción y los jugadores seleccionan de entre sus cosas aquella que mejor se adecue a la descripción. Pero la decisión es tomada por el árbitro, quien elige la cosa que según él calza mejor y le entrega la carta de descripción al jugador que la jugó.
Las combinaciones inusuales de cosas y de descripciones son chistosas al extremo. Una vez que un jugador haya ganado un número predeterminado de tarjetas, será el ganador.

RATING: 1
Apples to Apples should be fun but there are few issues with it that seem to suck the fun out of it. It's meant to be a light party game but can take far too long to play as each player rambles on about why they chose their card. I really don't want to spend more than 15 or 20 minutes playing a game like this and I'm counting each minute after that hoping it will end. The second biggest issue I have is that each player has to reveal which card they put in and then argue why it should be chosen only for the judge to choose someone else for a completely random reason. It means the arguments, which constitute most of the game are meaningless and the time spent arguing is wasted.  I much prefer the blind choice of Cards Against Humanity (even if that game is also poor for other reasons). Lastly the comedy just feels forced and the whole experience feels like forced fun.

If I could give this abomination of a game a 0 rating, I would. It's a random collection of cards to be played at random and hope for the best to randomly happen. Seriously, that is as valid a strategy as any. Did I mention this "game" is entirely random? Awful. Makes me want to stab my eyes out with a fork, because that would feel heavenly compared to sitting through a game of Apples to Apples.

RATING: 6
After three or four plays.
Very funny game. The charm lies in the often strange, and sometimes hilarious associations you make while playing the cards. Got quite a few good laughts, perfect as a party game. If you worry about fair and objective scoring, and about who's actually winning, you'd better forget about it. This game is about having a good time, not about winning.

The initial charm wore off a little after a few games, so I downgrade to '8' and eventually to '6'. Another gripe I have about the german edition is that it's very 'germany'-german. I'll have to make an Austria-edition sometimes.

As a party game, this is a lot of fun.  When we play, we usually play until everyone gets bored rather than to a specific score, then whoever has the most green cards at the end is the winner.  We also don't bother trying to disguise who played which card, just have fun arguing our point, especially if the red card has nothing to do with the green card (I remember one memorable session when I played "charging rhinoceros" on graceful, and almost won the point).  I would say the game is only as fun as you allow it to be.

RATING: 8.7
This game has been a favourite of my friends nearly the entire way through our twenties - I can't think of much higher praise than that. It's an excellent game for getting to know how your friends think and understanding their different senses of humour.

The only reason I didn't give it a perfect score is because some of the cards had American references that were lost on me (I'm from Australia). We've used permanent marker to change those cards to interesting or funny ones over the years, though, which has kept the game being played now that we're all in our thirties!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Can be loads of fun with the right group, but this is the game kids usually point at when I ask what they want to play, and it can be pretty boring with a bunch of kids who don't know who any of the people (or events and things) in the game are.

If I were rating this as an activity, I'd probably give it a 6.5. This isn't ActivityGeek. It's a bad game. Scoring is arbitrary and, by extension, inconsistent.

I'd "play" it again as long as it's understood that I'm not trying to do well at all. That is to say, I'm not treating it like a game.

I, personally, don't care for this game too much. We played it a ton when we first got it and we had some fun with it but it quickly lost its luster and playing with the same set of people, you can tell who chose which card and can easily sway the game. My wife and I have played this with other family members and friends and found that it can be ok but for the kiddos, it's just not that great.

So fun that every time I've played, we've never declared a winner--we just kept dealing the cards.  Game mechanics are well designed so that someone can step out (or in) for a hand or two with ease, a must for a big game night.

We always find ourselves saying "okay, one more time."

RATING: 7
Good game for after a dinner party. It's simple to learn, everyone can play, people can disappear for a bit without the game having to stop, no one usually cares about winning and most importantly it can be VERY FUNNY (Like all party games - a few drinks in quite a few people makes these type of games alot funnier).
Being English and only owning the American version, English version being out of print, means that some of the more obscure names are not very helpful.
Still worth getting though.

I know at some point it will re-emerge, since I love puns and predicting the effects of my choices upon my opponents.

Party games are the last things I want to play, but there are times that they are unavoidable.  There are much better games than this one.  My choice of party games are Taboo, Scattegories, Fish Bowl (just like Attribute) and Wits and Wagers.  I would never play this game as long as I can help it.

Instead of playing to win, play to make people laugh and you get the game. Heck, if there were an objective way to measure how funny a match-up was, I'd say use that instead of the original victory conditions!

RATING: N/A
Great shape!  Played maybe once, if at all.  Six red decks and one green deck are still in their factory sealed cellophane wrappers!  The rest of the cards look new.  The rule set has a wrinkle or two and the box shows very minor shelf wear.  Great gift game, or something to add to your party game collection.

Apples to Apples is fun enough, but not really exciting - and it's not the subject matter, as Cards Against Humanity has the same problem. Dixit seems better, offering the same general idea but actually making everyone think about how their friends would interpret an image.

Great with non-gamers and teens.  Very engaging and interactive.  Plus in 6  player games there is a rule that the last person to lay down a card for that category doesn't get to submit a card that round adds a little competitive touch to it.  Great with teens and families.

Always play that EVERYONE gets to contribute a card each round and this is a good party game.  It's light, and extremely quick so it doesn't get boring.  The fun is simply in hearing the answers and seeing what players will pick.  If you are overly concerned with winning, though, you will get annoyed with the game.  My biggest problem is that you can go through quite a number of cards in each game, so you will frequently see familiar cards that you have played with already.  The replayability is a bit low for me.

A simple party game where one person reads a question listed on a card and other people try to choose the best answer to the asked question using their hand of cards.

The game is very fun, and family friendly(for the most part). My main problem with the game is that it only really is an option if the party includes younger players. If everyone is able to handle adult content you'll always pick Cards Against Humanity over Apples to Apples.

If you have not played a party game like this, or if you are planning a shindig that requires a milder tone then by all means enjoy the heck outta Apples to Apples.

Delirious loony fun with the right group. It really helps to know what the members in your group find funny as that will point to how they will vote (some people always choose the most unlikely choice that is still somewhat related, or the one that makes them laugh the hardest). Anyway, read your group, and you will have a blast. Really, winning or losing is the least important part of this game for us. I don't recommend playing this with under six people -- you don't get as much variety in your noun choices with less, and it becomes too easy to read who played what card.

A subjective game in which you can easily get hosed by the luck of the draw.  Since I hate subjective games (especially those where people try to be funny with their choices), this game is a special form of *torture* for me.  The winning tactic is to play to the whim of each judge (i.e. be sure to play with people you know well, and hope you get cards they will like).  Note: I also dislike games that you must play with people that you know well.

Here's a simple set of components, and a simple set of rules, that really shines based on the group you're playing with, and with your own personality.

Unfortunately this game has been dethroned by cards against humanity, for me at least. YMMV

Played this when my brother-in-law bought it for my mother-in-law. At family get togethers she usually rips the cards out of "Would You Rather?" and asks them randomly.

This game was a refreshing change, and enjoyable with the right crowd.

We liked it so much we bought it.

RATING: 8
Easy game great for families or non gamers.

Stack of red cards...
Stack of green cards....

Player flips a green card.  Other players based on who the judge is try to impress the judge with a red card from a hand of 7.  The judge awards the flipped green card to the red card he likes the most and that counts as a point for that person that had played that red card.
Easy Peasy.

The next judge becomes the person to the left.

OK, this is just a light-hearted party game but it gets non-gamers to sit down, join the party and have a good time.  For a party night, this a great either early, to warm people up, or late, to keep people playing and laughing after their brain has gone to sleep.

I wouldn't pull it with less than 6 people but for 6+, it is a good game.

Fun, but sometimes silly card game. UPDATE: Lowering rating a point after only 3 plays, but the cards are already becoming too familiar, and combinations are beginning to repeat. Probably due mainly to the fact we go too far beyond the suggested card limit for completing a 'game.'

This is one of the very few games my father has ever requested to play.  For this reason alone, it ranks high.  While I can understand that this game can become monotonous if played frequently, when enjoyed a few times a year, I always find it refreshing.  As everyone receives a turn at being the judge, everyone can provide their own unique slant to the game.

Not as entertaining as a party game should be. There isn't any interaction and the players don't really need to get involved with each other (maybe this can be a plus, it's a party game you can also play with people who are a bit shy.)

Not a "gamer's game," per se, but perhaps the crown jewel of the rather dubious world of party games. Just don't ever, ever give a copy to non-geeks as a gift, or THEY'LL NEVER LET YOU STOP PLAYING.

Not my favorite game, or probably even my favorite party, but as an icebreaker it's hard to beat.  And played in the spirit of fun rather than fierce competition, with enjoyable people, it can be delightful.  Falls totally apart when players have some bizarre agenda, or are unpleasant people -- but honestly, most games won't stand up to those things well.

I bought this game because I wanted a party game that only took a minute or so to learn. [b]Apples to Apples[/b] is that easy, and it's fun too.  But many of my friends are were born in non-English speaking countries, and therefore their first language is not English. So a large part of the game was spent explaining the meaning of words and cultural references. It kind of took away the fun for me. Although they did learn new words, I would only recommend this game is for people that are fluent in English and western culture. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great with larger groups and non-gamers. We usually try to fit in a game in a games evening where there are lots of people as it is something everyone can play. Can degenerate into a random game of "just get a card down, any card" but still fun.

RATING: 3
Not really a game. It's a silly activity that lasts WAY too long if you play by the actual rules. I can stand this for 10 minutes tops before I start to seriously consider quitting out of boredom.

The only mild amusement to be had is watching someone try to "pitch" their answer when it has absolutely nothing to do with the prompt. And. like Telestrations, the worse the players are at playing, the funnier the game can get. I would play this again if asked, but would probably put up a fight.

Great game.  Consistently one I pull out with both friends and family.  The variety of cards and the ability to add your own give you continuous sources of entertainment.

I don't recommend this game for people who:

a) think rationally
b) like competitive games

There is no rhyme or reason to who wins in this game.  In fact, the referee can select winners in a completely arbitrary fashion.

RATING: 4
Maybe I'm playing with the wrong crowd. There are sometimes amusing juxtapositions of words (honest grave robbers?). But if people aren't lobbying or discussing the choices, the game becomes pretty boring pretty quickly. And while some people did end up being better than others (one person didn't score anything!), there doesn't seem to be any strategy here. It's not a TERRIBLE game, but there are better party games out there.

Great party/family game to play with non-gamers.  Lots of fun and laughs!

The entire game is simply one player (the judge) playing an adjective, and all other players playing nouns, hoping the judge will think their noun best matches the adjective.  Play circulates with each turn getting to be the judge until someone scores a certain number of points.

It's best played with people you know, as you really want to play cards that you know the judge is apt to choose.

In CAH the jokes are all written for you, but every turn you have the sense that enough of your cards will make a funny that you can win. In A2A, the jokes aren't pre-written, but you are often sitting there with nothing good so you just toss a card into the mix that is promptly ignored by the chooser. Sitting there with nothing good isn't fun. That being said, I would still rather play this than CAH.

RATING: 2
This is routinely a hit with non-gamers for me and in that context I am somewhat willing to play (if they really won't play anything else). But this is a PURELY content-driven game, so while it might be funny the first time around all of the humor literally evaporates once you've seen the cards and combinations a couple times. Give me something with actual creativity any day.

Attribute has the same concept but is much funnier and has better longevity thanks to actual player input and the match/mismatch idea to add variety, but unfortunately its fiddly scoring system and minor dexterity element can turn some people (especially non-gamers) off.

RATING: 4.7
The only good thing this party game has compared to some others I've played is that you don't know who's card is whose. Played with niece last time and she was really too young IMO and she was almost winning just throwing down random cards and getting lucky too.

RATING: 1
While party games are never my first choice, I am perfectly happy to play a game like Balderdash, Dixit, Crappy Birthday, or even (if the circumstances are right) Pictionary.

Apples to Apples is like a vampire that attacked those other games and sucked all of the fun right out of them.  It forces the players into making choices which do not allow for any creativity whatsoever.  The result is an experience which is boring and generally not fun.

I hesitate even to call this a game, The random and arbitrary nature in which a player wins makes it impossible to strategize on any level.

Reading the scathing comments on BGG is much more fun than playing the game itself.

Great fun with a big group of quirky people with good vocabularies.

Falls a bit flat with the wrong group though, and too many of the cards are too US-specific. (IMO it's fine to have someone like Abraham Lincoln, but not some minor celebrity no-one outside of the States has heard of. Having to ask other players to explain popular culture references makes the game much less fun, as well as giving Americans something of an advantage.)

RATING: 5
The original set has enough for maybe 4 or 5 games before the cards turn over, so expansion packs are required(ugh) It's light as air, but still fun. Not enough creativity involved to be one of my favorite party games though. A better game might be trying to predict what the person will select once all of the nouns are revealed. Lowered to a 5- really runs out of steam if played too often.

This game belongs in every gaming advocates collection. Very fun party game, very accessible. I don't play it often so I won't score it highly, but I often find myself in situations where I wish I had it with me.

Update 02/2009 - I don't personally play this anymore because I prefer Time's Up Title Recall or Wits & Wagers for party games; but I have it being played at many game nights I host with high school students. 

2015 - If I never play this again I am okay with that

RATING: 6
I enjoy this game for occasional play.  It can be amusing to play with younger kids -- you have to play to your audience when they're judging.  Just playing a noun they understand can win, even if it has nothing to do with the adjective in question.  "Disneyland" is "soft"?  OK...  :-)  At one family gathering, my siblings decided to dispense with the last-card-is-out rule so that everyone could play an accurate card.  Ugh... that was awful.  Turned a fun quick filler into a slow-paced drag.  On the other hand, when we played it at work a few days in a row, some players were pulling completely random cards out in order to just get included.  "The adjective is [slap] [slap] [slap].... uh, guys, I didn't say the word yet."

Update 9/2017: I just played with a newer edition of the game - and the speed element is now an optional "Quick Play" rule.  I disapprove heartily - this needs to be a fast game, not a slower, more cerebral game.

RATING: 7
An excellent party game - best with at least 8 players.  There are some great word combinations that can come from this game, especially if everyone has a good sense of humor (i.e. I once won the card "courageous" by throwing in "road kill".  What can be more "courageous" than "road kill" the moment before it becomes road kill?).

A great game, and a lot of fun.  My favorite of all the party games I own.

EDIT:  I have decided that this gets tiresome after a while - it definitely has to be played with the right people at the right time.  As in "adults with adults" and "kids with kids", as the kids many times don't understand the potential "adult-nature" that the game inherently contains.

The basic game play of Apples to Apples is fine, but this is a "family game" in the purest sense. It's meant to be played by all ages, but preferably with children and adults. Personally, I find that if you're playing Apples to Apples with an adult crowd- it can get boring fast.

Update for 2015 - This, along with similar games like Cards Against Humanity, lack something significant. An occasional perfect card hand will reveal a wonderful joke that gets rejected for a "better answer." And, ultimately, it doesn't work as a "getting to know you" game - if you don't already know the other players, it doesn't work. I still stand by my note that its playable by non-gamers - in fact, it's playable by non-thinkers. Ultimately, I'd rather play something else.

Original review - I normally hate party games.. especially trivia. Luckily, this wasn't trivial anything. Not only was it a complete blast (playing with mostly strangers, even) but it totally won me over as a game that even non-gamers could play. I'm not particularly fond of the timed "fast as you can play it" rules. Other more experienced players there said it plays better at a slower pace and I'm tending to agree with that despite not having tried it yet. Lowered to 7 because it really depends on the group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
There are a lot of laughs to be had in Apples to Apples and I highly recommend that everyone play it a couple times with other newbies.  The problem with the game becomes apparent when the laughs wear off and people start trying to win.  Even if one player is not going for laughs but hunkers down to win, its can drag the game down fast.  Good fun but not a good game.

Fun as an activity with a group, but not really a game to me.

This is initially a very fun party game, though it wears thin for me pretty quickly.  That being said, I certainly prefer it to most other party games!  Also, there are lots of sets out there to keep it fresh.  Best with lots of people... not sure if it's best to play quickly or slowly.  I prefer quick, but many I've played with are annoyed at the "last person in can't play a card" rule.

RATING: 5
A great party game for a crowd, however the fun factor is all dependent on the individuals you play with. This isn't something I like to pull out with just a few people but rather when I feel the crowd would have some fun with it. For instance I was the judge for a round on the topic of " Something you are a shamed of" and one younger girl who has never poked fun at me ever include card "Your body". When I discovered who it was I couldn't stop laugh along with the entire group. 

This Game is a great game to play and is also a great game in seeing how well you know the people you play with. For instance the theme was "terrible", and I knew my friend hated and despised Jodi Foster and that was exactly the card I had, bingo I win!

After we played at a friends house, my wife actually purchased Apples to Apples.  What a fun and light party game.  Encourages laughter and that is the basic ingredient for a party game.  I could see if you played it a lot, the repetition of the cards would most defiantly dull the game.  Bring it out once and awhile and this will be a great game night starter!

Shocking update: Apples to Apples becomes absolutely fantastic when you spend a bunch of time beforehand making personalized noun cards. The better the members of the group know each other, the better. This change turns Apples to Apples into a solid '8' or '9' from its usual miserable '1.' Original (and still relevant) comment below.

----------

I can't remember the last time I played a game this bad. Deciding whether 'Martha Stewart' or 'San Andreas Fault' is more 'easy' is not funny. I would rather play Duck Duck Goose.

The very best party games are essentially environments that foster creativity in all participants--creativity, in many cases, the players don't even believe they have. These games tend to be parlor games (Celebrities being the best example, really), because when the players determine all the content (names in Celebrities, whatevers in Charades or even 20 Questions, etc.), everyone can feel a sense of 'ownership' over the game. That is to say, each game of 20 Questions will have its own special dynamic created entirely by the players within the very simple framework. Time's Up, the commercial release of the near-perfect parlor game Celebrities, comes with a deck of celebrities' names that are to be used. Nothing could be worse.

Well, except for Apples to Apples. In this title, players' ownership over the course of the game is taken from them entirely and put into a deck of cards they had no control in creating. "Gameplay" consists of assembling the cards together, and presumably laughing about how inappropriate the card pairings sometimes were. This is depressing!

A light party game that is so simple you don't need to explain the rules.  The outcome is often so subjective it doesn't matter what card you play.  It really is fun for some groups, but the game is totally pointless - which is why I don't like it.  The only reason I have not rated it a 1 is because it actually has some merit for those times when you have complete non-gamers present in large numbers and need something...anything to fill the gap.  This does work for that...because everyone else thinks its great.

Fits lots of different crowds, both in size and level of experience of the players. I find it kind of pointless though. The only real strategy in the game is playing cards towards what you know about the judge for the turn and even that is a mostly pointless exercise as it is difficult to discern what completely subjective choices the judge is going to make. I much prefer Wits and Wages which rewards good guesses and strategic betting.

Apples to Apples is a party game that is not without charm, but which depends way too much on a combination of good cards and good people to be consistently worth playing.

There are times when the deck will feed funny responses to the prompts out consistently, while at others everyone will sit there rolling their eyes because nothing even vaguely funny was thrown into the pot.

Larger groups are better because it means there are more cards in the pool for each prompt, meaning something funny is more likely.

All of this said: I'm not a party gamer and stuff like this is never my cup of tea, so keep that in mind.

Family game.

Fun fast and light. Good for my family and other non gamers. Lots of laugh out loud moments with unexpected match ups and even funnier when you use the personality analysis at the end of the game.
Crate edition with expansions 1 and 2.

I took this to a family game night for my Sunday school class at church.  Wow, you just never know what you're going to find out about people playing this game.  The best situation was the mother of three having to judge "delicious" with "Cindy Crawford," "Marilyn Monroe," "Blood,"  "Having Surgery," and "Cow Pies."  Yikes.

I've played this game with lots of people, some of whom are game geeks, and some who don't really care for games.  Those who tend to dislike it most are the super-competitive hardcore types; they don't appreciate that the scoring is completely subjective.  But I for one have laughed more playing this game than any other game I've ever encountered...

I love this game!!  I'd give it a 10, but you do need the right crowd.  And there have been 1 or 2 times when everyone had a bad hand.  But if you just play to the person with the green card. FUN FUN.  And we always play speed.  This is not a game to be really thinging too literally.  You need to look at your cards and think outside the box quickly.
But I do love party games.

Great word association game for parties - fun to try to "fit" which card you play to the personality/likes/interests of the player acting as the judge that round (and to see the "aha" moment when new players realize this strategy -- if you could call it that).  Also works as a conversation starter.  We've had a lot of laughs playing this.

I think everyone pretty much knows this game, and while it's not especially well-regarded in gaming circles, this game still has a place as an interesting party game. We don't play it much anymore but I can see playing it with my kids as they get older, and I think it could help them with word association.

This is a stupid game. The only interesting aspect to it is the point where the quasi-pseudo-new-agers start acting like the cards you have in front of you somehow reflect characteristics of the holder's being or character in general as though the game was connected to the Toa Te Ching.

This is the best of the "Suck up to the judge"-games. A game many of my relatives both old and young keep asking
me to bring to family gatherings. The crate version has so many cards, we probably will never get through all of them. This makes for a lot of replayabilty. This is also an excellent way for non-english speaking people to learn
more of our language. But some of the cards are too America related and contain people or places few Norwegians know about. If playing with kids go for one of the kids versions or make the game yourself. I love
making my own games or versions that fit the audience I`m
playing with. Real gamers are not lazy!! My oldest son
went on a magic card trick phase and bought about 25 decks of normal playing cards. He demolished most of the decks and I had a heck of a lot of cards to make games out of. Along with several thousand MTG land cards I`m
set for life.

I have played with dummy hands that have won the game... Its very much a luck based game.  But that is ok! Every time I have played there is laughing and joy at the choice.  Its even fun to play it opposite. What is the absolute worst connection.  Its also funny when you give a card like "My neighbor" that allows for extremely witty and silly situations.  Though its a little frustrating that the winner usually is by random luck the process of playing still makes everyone happy.

Relax and have fun.

Apples to Apples, a game that can really make a party go from dull to suicidal back to dull in the span of one gutwrenching hour.  This game is fun if there really is no other game to play and is one of those "safe" games that one can recommend to play and people won't go "Ohhhhhh noooooooo, not that game!"  With a nice family feel to it, Apples to Apples seems like a game that would go well with a shasta soda, any form of generic candy and played to the tune of a heartfelt episode of Full House in the background (I'm sure Danny would be quite the competitor, "...the word is crazy: Jacques Costeau, 1960's, Canadians, or Banana's, oh all these are CRAAAAZY!) All in all, AVOID this game if you can, but if you don't want to get scoffed at for recommending a worth while game, then this "I'll just throw this card in" game is right up your alley.

The go to party game.  Works well in established groups (lots of laughs and inside jokes), and also in groups of strangers (where the game will act as an icebreaker and personality test).

The other day was discussing this at game meetup.  It was stated that Apples to Apples is "not a game" but merely a social experience.  I'm not hostile to this viewpoint, given a certain definition of "game"; I don't play Apples to Apples so much as use it as a vehicle or tool for a good social engagement.  It's a very good tool for what it does.

FYI, the same speaker placed Werewolf in the same category as A2A and I'm inclined to agree for similar reasons.

RATING: 6
When I'm in the mood to play this game, I enjoy it quite a lot. I'm not in the mood for more party-ish games all that often, though.

IMO, benefits greatly from play with friends (where you have a better shot of understanding their thought processes / entertaining them greatly with your choices) and from removal of the cards (mostly people, though not entirely) which carry little meaning / semantic weight for your group of friends.

Apples to Apples is a fun little party game.  While some of the scoring is going to be random (especially with a few people I have played it with) it can get fun to see what people toss out.  I should mention we pretty much only play the speed version, so that helps add to the fun of 'what were you thinking?" when cards get played.

RATING: 2
Components: Functional cards with (non-functional) clever phrases on them, but they leave a lot to be desired art-wise (and lack rounded corners).

Experience: Game is interestingly psychological, as players can really try to think which of their cards the active player would pick. One play per session is enough, and I recommend shortening the game by requiring fewer cards to win.

The game quickly wore out its welcome with me. It's an adventure in non sequitur humor, which is good for a few laughs, but not for any significant length of time.

It's a party game, and occasionally - at family gatherings - can be a lot of fun. Needs to have people who are willing to not be literal, so when Grandma plays "apple pie" with "my favorite food" the game gets old. When quiet, sweet daughter in law takes "touchy feely" and totally suprises us with "my bedroom", it's hilarious!

A very popular light party game. Best for large groups -- when it's certain that nobody wants to think hard or listen to many rules.

Only problem is that some people never want to STOP playing, so after a while it starts to drag.

Great party game with the right people - actually works best with varied groups as long as all are social people.  Have played with rabid Republicans and rabid Democrats in the same group and it was hilarious watching everyone play off each other's political prejudices - fun game for non-gamers!
Update - even with the expansions, I'm getting pretty tired of this, and in future will probably only pull it out for family gatherings or large groups of people who have been drinking.

This is a decent party game that anyone can play as long as they know how to read.  The biggest factor in this game is it matters very much who you are playing with.  More sense of humor in the group = more fun in this game.  That's probably true for most party games, but I found that particularly true for this game in particular.

Ok, this game has the potential to be a great party game in the hands of the right players; those willing to argue and challenge the "judge."

However, since those same people are highly unlikely to play this game with other, better, more engaging party games to be played, this title will be played by families where not rocking the boat is de-rigeur (at least with the family circles we have.)

Even in the later case, it will still provide some giggles, but the entertainment value wanes quickly.  

It's getting a five because of this. In the right hands a 6, the wrong hands a 4 and so I'm splitting the difference.

I don't usually like party games but this one is hilarious!  Since there are no rules for HOW the judge picks the best fit card, half the fun is laughing at her choice.

Amusing for a couple plays, but there's not really much to it... especially when everyone starts throwing out completely unrelated cards just because it's funny.

We were given a tip on a great game called Apples to Apples. We went to the store and bought it, not only did we buy the game we bought the boxed edition with all the expansions.

I have made it my mission in life to introduce this game to as many people as possible. My girlfriend and I introduced it to another gaming couple and the next time we saw them they had their own copy. Gave it as a Christmas present to her parents and now my girlfriend’s sister and aunt have gone out and obtained their own copy. Her parents’ neighbor now comes over and plays it with them. Wherever it is introduced it leaves a lasting mark. For me it has replaced Balderdash as my favorite party game. Such a simple premise seems to have caught on. Just about every game web site is singing its praises. Nongamers love it as well and it is a perfect game to pull out at gatherings that normally do not lend themselves to games, such as family reunions, company picnics or church outings. Once 4 or so people are playing it will draw a crowd and everyone will get involved. If playing with nongamers you should leave out the ‘last card played is picked up’ rule and then it is a social event that will be remembered. Don’t forget to get the expansions.

I can get sick of this, but it's popular for a reason.  The key is to make sure you actually play the game, with a limited number of target cards; if you just keep the deck rolling, you'll gradually look around and realize you're not having fun anymore, without being able to say exactly why.

I wasn't that interested in trying the game from the box description, but so many people have told me it is a really fun game.  I finally played with my family on Thanksgiving Day and was very disappointed.  It was fun for about 15 minutes and then I found myself wondering why everyone was raving about a game where there is virtually no strategy or skill involved.  With so many better "category" games on the market, I don't see the attraction to this one.

This game is so simple to teach that you can get any group to play it.  This is a big plus if half of your life's motive is to increase the amount of people who love playing games as a past time.

At the same time, I get a little bit tired of playing the game which is why I haven't rated it higher.

Overall, this game is a very good gateway party game. It is fun and I think playing with a very new crowd or with kids, this game excels. It's neutral enough where it won't offend anyone (unlike another game similar to this one.) As well, you just might learn something new. Does it last? No, will I play it again? Maybe, it just doesn't have the replay-ability to it that I wish it had, but that's what Say Anything is for.

Bad Game! People use experiences to inform decisions, which is fine as long as you were a part of those experiences. But, when people pick answers because of their friend from 1st grade who made them laugh and this card just reminded them of that time, it makes for a mind-numbing experience. Plus, several times your cards just don't fit the description. Both of these make it so too often you are randomly throwing cards down, and mostly because you just want a better card than that even though it has almost nothing to do with the description. What's worse: sometimes your throw away card gets picked!!!!??????

Apples to Apples... I have some old memories of this game which are mixed, but anyway, a great game to play with non-board game friends, especially younger ones.

This isn't really a game.  There needs to be a new category for this sort of thing (like Dixit).  "Social Experience Enhancer", perhaps?  Which isn't to say I don't like games like this, it's just that this one is a bit soft.  For non-family friendly fun: Cards Against Humanity.

Good party game.  Is it a game I would pick out to play with a game group? No.  Is it a good party game where enjoying your time with friends and/or family is most important?  Yes.  

Easy rules, no setup, easily played if drinking with friends.  You don't really need to clear off the table to play.

My in-laws love this game, so they bought it for me for Christmas a few years back, so they didn't have to bring theirs during Christmas/Thanksgiving.  I finally played it with them, and found it was a good game with family after the holiday dinner. 

I actually went from lurker to BGG user, with an account, after that first play with my in-laws.  So I credit this game with my joining BGG.

I have the Apple Crate Edition with the cards from the original core set and [gameid=5808] and [gameid=5865].

The most fun I ever had with this game was only using the adjective cards. My sister and I would flip over a card and then each of us would try to convince the other why that adjective described us more than the other person - regardless of what it was. Way more fun than the real game.

I'm astonished by how simple the components of this game are (just cards with words on them) and yet how fun it can still be. This game has to be played for fun, and not to win.

Fun filler. The main advantage of this game over other guess the popular opinion games is its scalability. Just dump the cards out on the table and an infinite number of players can play, it doesn't matter if people turn up late or leave before the game ends. A good play whilst people arrive game.

RATING: 6.5
Great fun with the right group of people. I wouldn't want to play weekly, but every couple of months is just right. Its ability to accomodate large groups is a big point in its favor.

Of course, the real value is the cards. The end condition rules are generally ignored, and the Baked Apples variant timing rule is almost always used.

RATING: 4
Mediocre.  A good party game, although it shines more as a social activity than as a game proper -- rating it solely as an activity, it'd probably be Fair.  Essential to enjoying it is not playing it very often.  But now that Wits & Wagers has solved the party game conundrum, I would never pull this out over this.

I sent my copy of A2A to my wife's classroom, where it's been a hit on game days.

Ugh. The only redeemable quality in this game is the small chuckle you get before you are filled with rage because the judge picked the most stupid choice that doesn't even make sense. They might as well pick randomly, I mean, your hand is filled with random cards, so why not?.  Good luck on getting a match.  Adjective: Corrupt, Winner: Rainbows....More like Adjective: Stupid, Winner: This game.

When this first came out - I LOVED it.  Then I played it 500 times and each time I played it I hated it more and more.  I guess I'm just not funny enough to play this game, since my family and friends always want the most hilarious answer.  I actually think I have a different sense of humor than most people, so that's probably it.  Won't play again unless someone REALLY begs me to.  And pays me money.  Now that I think about it, why do I still have this game?

[5 plays] I have become thoroughly sick of this, and will be happy if I never play it again, although I acknowledge that it has its place.  When you need something for a larger number of people, requiring no knowledge or skill, it can be a good icebreaker.  My game group in our early days used it for that purpose so much that I totally burned out on it.  The right people in the right mood and situation might enjoy it.  But to me it doesn't even feel much like a game.

Apples to Apples hasn't aged well. In the shadow of spiritual successor Cards Against Humanity, Apples to Apples seems dated from heart to subject matter.

Wife's game.  The party game everyone owns and seems to want to play.  I don't ever suggest it anymore because its pretty much just random sillyness as no-one plays it with any level of seriousness.  Seems like people just pick cards randomly sometimes which makes it kinda pointless.  Better if you go with the rule varient that allows for quickest to put cards down rather than everyone gets a card.  Good in large groups on occasion.

(After [b]2+[/b] plays) A party game that can provide excellent, mindless fun with the right group of people, especially if they have skewed senses of humour and/or are moderately intoxicated. Unfortunately, the mindless gameplay eventually dulls the humour, which severely handicaps its replayability. I appreciate its efficacy as a widely-accessible party game, but it has totally ceased to either interest or amuse me.

Apples to Apples can either be mildly fun or wildly frustrating, depending on the group. It's easy to learn, but many games degenerate into utter randomness, which takes away most of whatever enjoyment you can scavenge from it. There are much better party games out there.

[b]Update:[/b] Dropped from a 4 to a 3. The only way I'd play this game again is if Keira Knightley herself knocked on my door with a copy in her hand. 

[b]Update:[/b] Actually, perhaps Apples to Apples can provide a modicum of fun if you always go for the most ridiculous answers. Or maybe it's just the beer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I find one session of Apples to Apples is good for any party. Some players play straight while others play opposite (worst match) or to their own whims. The inconsistency usually ensures that a second round is not played.

Definitely a fun little party game, but since I was introduced to this game back in 1999, it's novelty has worn off for me, or maybe i'm just burnt out on it.

Biggest issue is that unless you house rule a way to get a new hand, you could be stuck with lousy cards all game.

I can see where the mass appeal to this game comes from. It's simple, fast, and fun. I can also see the limitations in the cards in your hand, and knowing that many times you're helpless in being able to play a card that will earn you a point. Of course, this isn't a game played to be won, but to have fun with friends. It succeeds at that, but I think I'm too much of a gamer to play this too much before it gets stale.

It's a fun party game, but pretty random. I often do better (and have a ton more fun) just throwing in a random card than I do by actually selecting something I think will be picked. Sometimes I even look at the card I'm tossing in, but it's more fun if I don't.

A fun diversion, mainly good with non-gaming family members. Grows tiresome, especially with everyone carping that they "have no good cards." It's a random distribution of cards, people! Cards that have no intrinsic worth! Apply them creatively! Or would you prefer it if we stacked the deck so you would have "Marylin Monroe" every time the "Sexy" green apple card came up? One family member, in particular, seems to think that she can tell who layed down what card based on personality, as if people could choose what cards they hold in their hand. Still, one of the best party games I've ever played.

*** Starting playing this again after a break, and I'm enjoying it again. It's the effect of playing it with new people, rather than the game itself. Pushing my rating up to 7.5.

*** Played the new Out Of The Box British Isles edition. Very good, much better than the old UK ediiton. Well worth getting.

*** I got the US editions at last! *** Great fun the first few times, great for non-gamers. The UK edition I have is published under license by Tactic. It has a bigger box, flimsy plastic holder and badly printed, flimsy cards. Naturally it costs more for less! It has the same stuff as the US edition but with UK celebs like... Bobby Moore, Norman Wisdom, Chris Tarrant. If you get to America, buy the US edition, it plays better! *** Played it twice with 9 players, it works well, big laughs. More fun than a game really.

For a light filler game, this can be played endlessly (but best to limit it to 1 or 2 games). While games like Cards Against Humanity do the same and often with more humour, Apples to Apples doesn't leave you questioning your morals afterwards which makes it overall a more satisfying game. Would be better in a smaller box.

This game has a LOT of laughs. I have been playing this with 8 people and it's great with that many. I think more would be even better. If you have a ton of folks coming by, break this out. But for your regulars, it's not going to see much time after some early plays. For them the star will burn very bright early on, but burn out fast.

A classic party game, the enjoyment get out of it depends on the sort of creativity and ridiculousness that the players bring into it.  While its obviously incredibly light stuff, it truly shines in situations where you have a lot people (and alcohol) involved.

* Played 15+ times. Not many party games are worth playing, in my book, but this one is fun. It&#039;s quick to teach and to play, and it&#039;s funny, but not convulted with novelty (like Mad Gab which I loathe). Highly recommended as a party game, but, like all party games, don&#039;t play this too often or you&#039;ll loathe it. Indeed, the only danger of this game I know of is that your non-gamer friends will like it and ask to play it all th time which means you&#039;ll be sick of it! I owned this, then gave it as a gift.

RATING: 9
Apple Crate Edition.  Family Favorite thought of as a classic. The whole family can play--any age, even those with beginning alzheimer's (On the most basic level, all they are required to do is add a card to the pile, and at some point pick a card.  It doesn't hurt the game at all--in fact, sometimes improves it. No wrong choices.  This way they can feel a part of the group.)

As with many party games, the crowd makes or breaks it.  With the proper players, I can see this being a riotous hoot of fun.  The times when all offered cards match the green card is always quite revealing of the judge's decision process.  Lots of fun.

Delightful game that you can play with anyone who knows how to read, and even sometimes with people who don't.  You'll go through the cards fast, but the decks are large, so I never feel like I've played all the same cards before.  If you're looking for something with strategy, though, this is definitely NOT the game for you.

I can still remember a couple funny moments from this game, but I have absolutely no desire to play anymore.  The game quickly progresses from being funny to just plain stupid.  There's just not enough cards in your hand to be clever on a regular basis.  Opt for Say Anything instead.

[Party Game] I don't see what it is about the game, unless you all share a cockeyed sense of humor and are ok with someone judging it. Attribut is a game along the same lines but done much better than this. *** UPDATE: What I dislike about Apples to Apples is the arbitrary nature of the awarding of points. In good party games, there is an objectivity that keeps the game fair but maintains the lightness and humour. As mentioned before, Attribute (English edition) is significantly superior in execution and gameplay to Apples to Apples. It may be slightly more difficult to explain, but the dividends are greater.

RATING: 5
Maybe I haven't played it with the right crowd, but after a few years of having it on my wishlist after hearing how great it is (and I generally enjoy word related party games), I've been a little disappointed with it. Doesn't create the kind of light-hearted laughter that other party games do. It's not painful so I'll play it, but there's just something about it that I'm missing.

This is rated a 6.2?  Shame on you geeks for hating on a game just because it's popular. This is one of the few mainstream games that I truly enjoy. Of course, it's a party game, not a gamer's game.  Winning isn't even the point, but it's a lot of fun.

RATING: 3
I understand its place and it certainly doesn't deserve to be trashed outright, but I have rarely enjoyed a round of Apples to Apples. Play it straight (win or lose) and feel like you made zero meaningful decisions in the service of creating some marginally funny answers, or try to play it sideways (be the bad guy, give points to unexpected cards, try to manipulate the judge's deliberation) and annoy your friends who are just in it for some silliness.

Apples puts cards in your hand, tells you there are points to be scored, and then insists that angling for points isn't what you should be doing. I guess it's a fair enough rule for an ice-breaker. The problem is that Apples takes a long time and trudges the entire way. Much better ice-breakers out there.

I can't help thinking that anyone who doesn't like this game needs to find some funnier friends.  This is a blast when played with exuberant, creative (and perhaps argumentative) people. 
----- 
I will add that I haven't had such a good time lately with the game because of judges like this: "Let's see... does 'Cheetah' or 'Sloth' go better with 'Fast'?  I think sloths are sooo cute.  I pick 'Sloth'."  If the game is completely devoid of ANY rationality, it seems pointless.  Sure, one could argue that in such a case one just needs to play to the judge, but if one of my friends is that big of an idiot, I'd rather not have to think about it.

How this game ever became as popular as it did is a giant mystery to me. For people to say that it's a "non-gamer" game or a party-game is absurd. It's just a BAD game. I have no idea how anyone can play this game. If Jesus Christ Himself came down from on high and asked me to play a game, I'd have to think long and hard about it. This game is the epitome of the word interminable. You want a party game? Play Balderdash or even Trivial Pursuit, but leave this one where it belongs: as far away as possible.

More of a social activity than a game. It gives way too much power to the whims of whoever is the judge to the point that it always ends up feeling completely random.

Fun party game--light, enjoyable, one you can get pretty much anyone to play.  

However, be warned--the enjoyment factor decreases after each and every play.  After about 5 or 6, you'll probably be done with this.  

I still dig it because it can irritate people who think you're not judging the "right" way.  Screw it man, it's a game.

EDIT:  Man, this game gets less and less fun with each play.  I think I mirror a lot of people's experiences--the first couple of times are hilarious, then a steep drop off with each play.  I pretty much only drag this out now when the kids ask for it.

RATING: 4.738
Short term enjoyable simple fun nonsense, but with not a lot of long term appeal.  With experienced card players, it can just becomes a game of random snap unless you invoke the "everybody plays a card option".  Still, a nice party icebreaker when the environment is too disruptive (eg: small children) to play a more focused board game, but only with people who have not played it before, given that it really is bubblegum (ie good for the first chews before the taste goes) (01/01/09). UPDATE: I have this sense that the game is slightly broken and just doesnt appeal anymore - and can use the junior version for kids, so now an archive game (rating reduced by 1 to 5) (17/9/11). UPDATE: For some reason, its that game which we all need to have on the shelf even if we never want to play it - gone (Rating 4.738, Jan 17).

We played first with the "one less card than the number of players" rule, and it turned into a competition to see who could get cards out fastest. That sucked, as there was no time to put thought into your answers. Also, I won as many playing randomly as I did thinking about it. We then modified the rule so that we could play one card each, and we still played fast but there was time to think and it was a whole lot more interesting.

 I would say that Apples to Apples is easily a take it or leave it title for me.  It lends itself to playing with people you either know intimately or not at all, as those people with stronger knowledge of each other will have an easier time making correct guesses.  Apples to Apples can offer a few chuckles when certain adjectives are juxtaposed with off the cuff nouns, but I tend to assign most of those laughs to inebriation.

Pick one of your cards you feel describes the green card. The judge picks the one they like the best then judge shifts to next player. Light game, pretty quick not much required here. Kid friendly casual game.

Great light fare for getting a game night started with a group of at least 5. 4 works but the more the merrier. This also great because people can join in and drop out a needed and it doesnt mess up the game. Also works well for broad spectrum of ages together.

Widely criticized yet almost ubiquitous, this might be the new love-to-hate-it game for game nerds, usurping Monopoly's position at the ass end of the totem pole. Personally, I think this game suffers from some serious flaws, but that they just don't matter that much in the grand scheme of things.

You draw a hand of nouns. One player draws an adjective from a special deck and drops it on the table. Everyone secretly places one noun they think best fits the adjective face down onto the table in front of them, and once everyone has played a card, the judge - the player who drew the adjective - collects them, reads them aloud, and picks their favorite. A player wins after collecting some number of adjective cards that really doesn't fucking matter so just make it up even though it's probably 5 or 6. Dead simple, takes 45 seconds to teach, and can be played in almost any mental state.

The "problems" are as follows:

1. The judge can pick anything. A "clever" player will get upset when the judge chooses a noun that appears to have no connection whatsoever with the adjective, but that maybe the judge just likes, or reminds them of something funny, or else they just chose at random. The "clever" player sees this as a grand injustice.

2. The cards are dull. Many players may have difficulty finding adjective fits for "Cabbage" or "The 1930s".

That's pretty much it. These are valid criticisms! 1, especially, means that players who prefer a strategic good time (virtually everyone who has ever created a BGG profile ever) will be frustrated by their inability to control their own fate. They will rage at the judges' arbitrary decision making even as their own stints as judge fail miserably to entertain the group because they misunderstand the point of party games entirely. This definitely CAN feel shitty.

I just don't think it's that big of a deal! You play this game with like 8 people because 1. there's not much else to play with 8+ and this one has zero teaching time to it and 2. it facilitates silly interactions between party guests which is all you really wanted to begin with.

You don't play this game to 1. advance your language skills, 2. challenge yourself intellectually, or 3. compete seriously with one or more other players in a contest of skills.

Just accept it for what it is, and move on.

Incidentally everyone interested in games academically should play this game at least once. It's hard to deny its influence on gaming as a whole, as a number of Apples-to-Apples-like games have since spawned from it, with varying degrees of success, most notoriously "Cards Against Humanity".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Once you figure out that you're just trying to give the judge your card that they'll like the best--not the card that best matches their adjective--you realize that the only reason to play this is if it's the only way you can get people you like to stay in one place for awhile.  Then you ask yourself exactly how much you like those people.

Doesn't do it for me (possibly because I'm bad?). The game is never the fun part about playing this... The anonymous factor prevents people from spinning stories around their card choices, and I'd rather play something like The Sentence Game for experiencing my friends' senses of humor.

RATING: 7.1
Tried it once, had a lot of fun even playing with people in very altered states of mind.  My big beef with this type of game, even moreso than wits and wagers or trivial pursuit, is that sooner or later people will see cards they've already seen and this reduces the novelty and challenge.

   A fun chatty game. Fantastic ice breaker for new people to meet or for family gatherings.  Being the type of game it is, a party game, I think it is nearly perfect.  Two full games in a row can be a strain.  
   I have the party crate and have had few repeates in 12 games. There are times where people have crossed purposes... to be acurate or ironic, unfortunately one mans ironic is another mans obsurd.  So a times the fun can wan.  If anyone "tries TOO hard" to win it is time to put it away and play a different game that is appropriate mentaly.  It is only about lighthearted fun.   
   I will update here if there could be replay issue, but not sofar.

At first I didn't like this game much but after a few more plays and a little deviation from the rules it's better.  Instead of one red and everyone puts in a green, you as the judge put in a red AND a green or two reds.  A bit more entertaining that way.

Still just a party game though.

Acquired 6-16-2007. (Update March 2008) This game produces much laughter at the table. It plays quickly, is extremely simple, and is just plain fun for a group.

May 2009 --  This is our granddaughter's favorite game, so we play it fairly often, just to involve her with our family gaming sessions.

October 2011 -- We continue to enjoy playing this fairly often, particularly to involve our teenage granddaughter in our game days, as it is almost the only game she will take time to play with the group. It is the only party game we enjoy playing and counting in our game statistics.

Great fun with a large group.  Need people with a sense of humor though... Basic game gets stale quickly after repeated play, need expansions to keep it fresh.  The extra 0.5 for the fact that all of my friends across all spectrum of lifestyle and background enjoyed this game enough to request it!  Very versatile!

UPDATE: Down grading a point, because after repeated plays, though the new cards add some freshness to it, but the game mechanism gets really OLD.

l thoughtfully took a homemade Disney-theme version of Hollywood Blockbuster to L.A. in the hopes my girlfriend's friends we were staying with would enjoy this game that was perfectly themed for our visit. Come game night, they opted instead for Apples to Apples -- "even less thinking than Taboo", the hostess tittered. The only highlight of that game was my playing an unaltered blank card for "Frivolous (trivial, silly, shallow)", saying the answer was already written on the back of the card. In the end, an overly-long session of unfunny randomness. Because of this letdown, I now refuse to ever play Apples to Apples again.

This game basically enables people to be funny.  If they aren't funny otherwise, the game doesn't work.  If they *are* funny, the game is really great.  Simple enough?

A good party game that you don't have to 'perform' in to do well, so that is nice.  There is a great pub near me where there almost always is a game of this going on, and I can see why now that I have played.  I can see why you would need expansions after a while for this and it's pretty funny to see what people come up with.  My favorite winning match from last night: Lovable -- Zucchini.

[gameid=74] is not a bad game, but the appeal is not very lasting, in my opinion.

Can be fun with a social crowd - especially if players indulge their senses of humor.  As familiarity with the various cards increases, the fun factor decreases.  This is not a game to be taken seriously, which should be obvious from the fact that your points are awarded by your fellow players.  The fun is in arguing your case and in enjoying the ironic or un-straightforward answers.

The chief virtues of Apples to Apples is its informality and ease of play. There are definitely much better party games for ludophiles, but this one has a chance of success with ludophobes.

One of my favorite party games. As a player that enjoys awarding the most incongruous plays, I especially love frustrating the (oh so boring) literalists! I find this game gets better as the blood alcohol level of the group rises.

I played this a few times and cannot get into it. I doubt this one will see my table again anytime soon. The discussion aspect of this game drives me nuts. Some choices make more logical sense than the others but because somebody is funnier or has something in common with the decision maker they get the points. I could not wait for this one to be over.

Just barely tolerable with these house rules:

1. You can (but don't have to) throw back any cards with proper nouns on them. [This reduces how much you have to care about Don Rickles to play.]

2. Last person to put a card in doesn't get to play. [This speeds things up.]

3. Pull a random (face-down) card from the top of the deck to add to the options. The deck can score points like any other player if its option is selected. [This reduces the embarrassment of playing fast. Card doesn't make sense? Maybe the deck played it!]

I never want to play this again.  It wasn't remotely fun.  Even if I logically have the best card someone won't pick it because they don't know or they like star wars and will pick darth vader.  Terrible game.  If you ask me to play it I might accidently destroy it.

This game is really group dependent.  If you're playing with a bunch of literary fuddy duddies, just pack it up.  The fun is all in the crazy or ironic matches you can make.

I don't understand how anyone like this game.  Complete garbage.  The social dynamics of Apples to Apples are roughly those of a sold-out Greyhound bus stuck in stop-and-go traffic.

Good, very light party game.  The problem, like with most games, is that with certain people this can get pretty tedious, even smart, otherwise pleasant people.  Certain people, for example, always reward "funny" cards like "Tyrannosaurus Rex" or "Ninjas" even when totally irrelevant, so the game boils down to luck of the draw, hoping that you get the "automatic win" cards like those.

A wonderful game that's accessible to everyone and always provokes a smile. It's nice to have a party game that doesn't intimidate people for their lack of knowledge. *UPDATE* My feelings for this game have gone down severely in the long time since I last played it. Certainly unique, but it wears out quickly. For non-gamers, it is probably a welcome change from typical party gamers, but in the long run I don't think it holds up very well.

A very good little party game that uses an interesting method for determining the winner of each round. Since the judge picks which card wins it means everyone has a chance and even the most unlikely card can come out as the winner. Everyone takes it in turns to be the judge so it makes it quite fair. Good fun to see everyone fumbling for their cards trying to get one down in time to have their card count!

Apples to Apples is a madlibs style of party game. A very popular one, cards each have a verb/noun/adjective that player match with the "judges" main card. Whichever the judge like the most gets the point. While very group dependent, the humor and fun definitely exists. The idea is done better in newer games, and the lack of structure doesn't necessarily point players to jokes and laughter. This style of game can be wonderful, but Apples to Apples doesn't seem to be the best this genre has to offer.

This game could be fun for some, and does have the hilarity that ensues, which if you are in the mood can be nice.  I'm normally not in the mood, more wanting to just joke around if I want humor, hence not really MY type of game.  This is rated along my personal tilt of how I like the game.  I think others who like humor party games could have a blast with it.

For an easy game that is completely non-threatening to non-gamers, this game has no equal.  I can bring it out just about anywhere and people end up playing.

Very, very simple and easy ruleset, and because there aren't particularly "turns", it's one of the few games that scales extremely well from 3 to 10+ players.

Super fun game. No one feels like they are bad or aren't competitive in the game. Clean content. Simple idea. Only real game mechanic problem is that the judge picks the one that should most describe the green card; however, a large mount of people want to play the most left field card for each answer in order to get laughs. This creates like a division of the game between people who are actually playing the way it was meant to and people playing essentially cards against humanity.

Simply a great game... especially if you play with fun or interesting people.

This is not a game about "winning" or "losing", although it's nice that there is a competitive element. But the competition is all psychological -- if you like seeing how other people's brains work (or trying to figure out if you can guess their way of thinking, or if you can bluff them when they "know" your way of thinking), then this is a good party-game style activity for you...

Even better with a total mix of personality types and brain types -- it brings in an element of trying to psychoanalyze or "figure out" who would place (or vote) on which card, based on how literal, comical, logical, etc they are. (although I get the feeling creative types and people into wordplay and psychology will find this a much more enjoyable game than logical/mathematical/strategic people would.)

There are better party games.  

There are too may cards that just don't mean anything to anybody I've played with (quick: how many adjectives do you associate with 'Eleanor Roosevelt'?)

And it's too luck of the draw based.  Most of the time I don't have any cards that fit the bill, so it doesn't matter what I submit because the one person who did is going to win anyways (quick get rid of 'Eleanor Roosevelt').  And when I do have a card that fits the bill, I will usually win, because nobody else will have one.  It is difficult to plan ahead for such a moment, though.

The game is simple fun in the company of family and casual friends. There isn't much depth to the gameplay which makes it simple to pick up and play.

My gripe with the game is that the rules seem completely arbitrary with a new subjective judge every round and sometimes the cards you draw are not in the least bit amusing. Occasionally, no one will have an applicable card so random throw-away cards will be submitted. In this case, a random one will win for no apparent reason.

As with most social games, it isn't about winning. If you can relish the moments where a perfect answer is picked, then this is the game for you!

In 1998, there were basically two types of party game: Trivia or Charades. Trivia rewards players for various types of knowledge outside of the game; Charades can include drawing, acting, singing, etc., but the goal is to get your team to guess a clue. Apples to Apples started a paradigm shift. 

In this game, one player is the judge. The judge flips a green card with an adjective such as "disgusting" written on it. The other players will then each secretly select a red card from their hands with a noun on it, often a proper noun. The selected cards are shuffled so the judge does not know which player gave which card. The judge then looks at them and selects which card he/she feels best fits the adjective on the green card. The player who selected that card gets a point, and someone else becomes the judge. 

It's an easily accessible concept that will quickly appeal to those more of an empathetic mind than a mathematical one. Probably for that reason, the typical strategy gamer may not find much here to like. A player who finds himself annoyed at the judge's choices, rather than amused by them, will not enjoy this experience. Other times, luck of the draw may play a large role. Ultimately, all the players have the same decision to make each turn: which of these cards is best? Sometimes none of them seem good, sometimes many of them do, but long-term planning and clever tactics will not be found in this game.

Apples to Apples single-handedly redefined the party game genre. For that, it rightly deserves its place in board game history. Nevertheless, much like in music, innovation on the part of the creator doesn't always translate to enjoyment on the part of the consumer, and I feel that is the case here.

The key to winning this game is "know your audience".  If you know what kind of association (most accurate, most opposite/ironic, most funny/laugh-inducing/zany) the judge will vote for, you can choose a card that is more likely to be picked.

However, there are at least two problems with the game: (1) a judge who picks random answers, or whose voting criteria changes dramatically from round to round, really screws up the game and makes it less fun; (2) luck of the draw often wins... sometimes you've got terrible cards and can't do anything appropriate/opposite/funny.

But overall, this game can be a fun, funny, ice-breaking party game.

Bought this new at a Thrift Store in package only knowing the hype and strong regard for the game. Here's the thing. I played Cards Against Humanity to the point where i was burnt out on that before i got this. Apples to Apples is a family version of CAH. Considering i'm an asshole and the offensive version is more to my taste it's almost impossible to scale backwards and get into this. That said i can appreciate how this would be a fun experience for anyone offput by CAH, so my rating reflects that despite the liklihood i'll never play this.

Hardly the best party game out there. Attribut and Wie ich die Welt sehe clearly beat it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Yes I rated this higher than Catan, but I scored it whilst keeping in mind that it's a party game.  Depending on the group, this really will be the game that I suggest.  If I go to a friend's house and see people playing, I would jump right in without hesitation.

For what it is, it's an 8.

Sold.  Dixit is our go-to game now with similar mechanics.

RATING: 8
Got this on my first gateway purchase. We have LOTS of picture flash cards from different editions in many shapes and sizes. When I found out how simple this game was, we played Apples To Apples with them. We absolutely needed picture cards for the smaller kids who cannot read. It's probably fine for older people, but not intended for a 3 year old. I purchased it without knowing anything about it though.  

Light 4-7 player Party game.

RATING: 3.9
On the surface this feels like a fun game, but it has one major flaw. People quickly start to notice the last player to vote cannot win, and the card that makes the least sense almost always wins. Because of that people just randomly play any card from their hand.

RATING: 5
Great party/family game quite fun with the right group.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
As you may have noticed from my rating (1), I do not like this activity.  I refrain from calling it a "game" because the judge has supreme control in their criterion for picking a card, eliminating any game rules and theory, and can be capricious and arbitrary.

Perhaps I have not played this with sufficiently serious players, but in all my plays (involving mid-school aged and family members) the game has simply degenerated to the judge picking the funniest word arbitrarily.  There is no way to predict, strategize, or otherwise "game" the decision.  The only benifit to this supposed game (that I have seen) is its educational aspect when a younger player does not understand a specific word or term on the cards.

Apples to Apples holds as much excitement for me as a pack of mid-school flash cards!

Apples to Apples - I suppose this works a good party game for a group that doesn't know each other well.  However, after a few plays, it becomes...boring.  I have yet to try it the "opposite" way..that is having a handful of the green (adjective) cards and playing a red (noun) card as the main card...might make it better.

Great party game, overall very funny when arguing about your words. The only problem is that when someone is about to win, the judge and play favorites and you might not win even if your card is better than someone elses. There are a lot of cards to play with, and because every game is different, its very replayable, and does not really need the expansion.

I rate this game a 9, with this consideration: I am rating it based specifically that it is in a party game genre.

Or possibly at the end of a long session of meaty games. It is more for fun than playing a game. The chaos of it all takes the game part out of it.

Question: I have played a game similar to apples to apples but involving personality traits. You have a series of cards with different traits and you match them to a game player. Another variation is were a card is played and you have to choose which card this most relates to. Has anyone ever played this game? if so could you please tell be the name.

Okay, so it's only good when you are tired and in a properly silly mood, and with the right group. But it is a party game, after all.

Apples to Apples is not designed to feed any appetite for competition.  This "game" is a social psychology lesson.  Players will learn about the likes, dislikes, past experiences, inside jokes, etc. of all of the other players.  I enjoy the game, but find it tough to find the right group for the perfect environment.  If there are a mix of people, some very familiar with a few others and some simple acquaintances or strangers to others, the game gets unbalanced and awkward.  The familiar players (especially couples) tend to inadvertently or intentionally play between one and other, and the less familiar players tend to get marginalized.  Apples to apples tends to play the best if everyone playing is equally familiar or unfamiliar with everyone else playing.

Have played this game many times and don't think I've ever enjoyed it. Maybe it's because my competitive nature won't let me play a game "just for fun" or maybe it's because I always think people choose the wrong answer, but I get annoyed just thinking about this game. If I'm gonna play an opinion-based game I'll play Cards Against Humanity any day over this because at least I get some laughs from CaH.

A lot of people like this game but it kind of bugs me. It plays more like an activity to me than a game. People sit around and talk and then occasionally throw down a card like "Pig" to answer the question of "Delicate" and it wins. Not my kind of game but it's the easiest to get played when I have groups of 8 or more people and all the non-gamers seem to love it. I play it a lot in my Ward and FHE.

A great party game for people who only play games at parties.  But its never my first suggestion.  The game is void of strategy and is 100% subjective. I could see this being something to play as a family, but the only way to truly enjoy the nonsense of this game be to play its adult version, CARDS AGAINST HUMANITY.

I generally don't like party games, and I'm not a social gamer. I'd rather play a game I like with people I don't, than vice versa.

The choices you make are uninteresting and dictated by chance, and unless players get to argue/debate a case for why their card should be chosen, the interaction is minimal.

This game grows old fast, even with the expansions.  Made worse by the fact that non-gamers glom onto it and will play nothing else.

Okay, I'm a little less cranky about this game than I was when I made the above comment.  This can be an awesome game in the right situation.  It's greatest strength is how easy it is to pick up and non-gamers are not at all intimidated by it.  

I, personally, don't think I could ever enjoy it again due to the six hour session my extended family played one holiday dinner day.

Yes, I said SIX HOURS STRAIGHT.  From 5 pm to 11 pm.  bbrrrrrrr, it still gives me the shivers.

RATING: 3
Apples to Apples just isn't very much fun for me. I find the game very limiting - the red cards I have frequently aren't particularly interesting, relevant to, or absurd compared to the current green card in play.

There is a laundry-list of games that have taken this game's judging format and improved upon it. While I might be willing to play this with a group of non-gamers, I'd rather play one of those newer takes on the formula.

Played a couple times with my girlfriend's family.  They loved it, but then again they aren't exactly boardgame fans, and almost any game that is introduced to people who have only played monopoly and life, they think it's the best game in the world.  But, It is a fun, party game, and it really is a game you bring out just for laughs.  And if that's all that you're looking for, then this game is it.

Can be a fun family game, or a funny game, but is very repetitive and shallow to play over time.

The novelty wears off quick, but if you need a VERY casual game for a large group, or a game which requires little attention at all, this works.

Mostly, this game is alternative to doing nothing at all; amongst gamer-friends, it is in the just-about-never-chosen category.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (June 2010)

One of the first games I ever played, first let me tell you that I love party games, but not this one. At first I thought this was almost fun, but I dislike Apples to Apples. The game is completely random; you have no way to control your victory. Winning depends on the mood of the judges, if you could write anything down as an answer the game would be better, but you are limited by your cards. If you want a party game go play Dixit or Time´s Up, both very superior games.

Really didn't grab me that much, alas. The idea that fun dialog would happen just didn't seem to spark that well in the couple of games I've been in. We played around with it, but "meh". I much prefer Pictionary.

Can be a really great time with a large group of people.  However, you can get some "bad-apples" playing the game who will intentionally screw with the outcome of a hand.  You actually need to have an idea of who is making the decision and how they will think.  It can get pretty deep for such a simple game.

RATING: 6.5
I rate it this highly because it's a game that I know everybody is at least WILLING to play. There are certainly laughs involved (if you know the people with whom you are playing). (Ending sentences with a preposition is something up with which I will not put... :-)...)

However, I (and my wife, believe it or not!) don't really like this game. It's not a boardgamer's game by ANY means. There's about a pinch of salt worth of strategy. If you don't get cards that evoke many adjectives in your head, then you're just flat out of luck.

Great for those in-laws who won't play games, though... if this is something you really want to do with your hour.

This is the BEST non-gamers game blowing away all those BORING Trivia games that drag and drag. Anyone can play this game immediatelly with brief instruction and have a ball. Players alternate choosing which other players secret answer matches what they think is the closest answer. You can play repeatedly with the same set because you rarely would ever have the answers match up again and it doesn't make a difference anyhow. Miss Panda's game.

I must start out by saying that I usually don't like "Party Games."  So why the '9' rating?  Ease of play (like Attribute), simple rules, and, most important, my wife usually wants to play.  Any game that I can get my non-gamer wife to actually WANT to play must be one of the best... and it is.

We played through all the cards in about 2 sittings (crate edition).  Fun game, mix up the cards and the players and its still fun for a long time.

The grandfather of all the games to come after it, this one has a special place in my heart.  While some may have done it better, this one did it first.  It certainly holds up as a fun game and something I would use to introduce people to how enjoyable games can be.  However, as someone who has played Cards Against Humanity before this one, it just left me wanting to play Cards Against Humanity.  An oldie but a goody and one I'd suggest to everyone.

[Party Crate plus first Crate expansion]
[>5 plays] One of the best party games when played with the right crowd. The fact that the judge determines his own criteria for the winner means that people who take it to seriously can be frustrated. Of course, it's a PARTY GAME, so just have fun with it and laugh a lot.

We like to play that the winner of one round is the judge for the next round.

Frustrating.  I hate to rate it so low, because I think the concept is fine, but it just hasn't been fun for me.  My experience has been that the active player usually picks the Thing card that LEAST matches the Description card, because "it's so ridiculous, it's funny", or there is some inside joke between the two players.  If I try to play the game as intended, I come in dead last.

Tired of the rush to absurdity with most players. Real number of plays probably something like 8-10. No real desire to play anymore. I feel like I've seen all there is to see here and am rating accordingly. I suppose my rating could go down. Wits and Wagers is much better as a party game.

This falls into the category of 30% game, 70% social experience.  The "winner" of each round is judged in an entirely capricious and assertively subjective manner - which is fine.  It adds to the fun and the discussion.  Moreso than better structured party games like Taboo, this gets people together, and encourages creativity and laughter.

This game is very group dependant. With kids I could see having fun playing this, with adults it's usually low-brow humour. This is not really a game at all. There is no objective scoring system, you just get together say some stupid shit to each other and laugh. Not my kind of fun.

This. Game. Is. FUN!  There is no strategy nor is there any kind of continuity as to which red apple card will be chosen for any given green apple.  However, anyone who says this isn't a good game needs to take a serious look in the mirror.  Obviously they take themselves too seriously.  I mean, who can't love a game where "Toaster" is the best descriptor for "Affluence" or where "Girl Scouts" are "Easy"?  This will get a LOT of play during future parties.  I just cannot say enough good things about this game that causes 13 and 14 year olds to put down the video games, turn off the TV and then BEG to play "Just once more Dad.  Please".  Sure it's not Puerto Rico or Agricola, but for a large group of relative strangers, this is THE game for me!  Just like "THE Dump" will win every time!

Apples to Apples is fun enough for very short periods of time, but there is nothing in it to keep my interest after a few rounds. 

As an end-of-the-day, tired with your pals kind of thing, it works just fine, but goodness does it ever drag on. Cards Against Humanity has mostly replaced it with the people I spend time with, and though that has some of the same problems, it is at least a bit more consistently funny.

RATING: 9
This is the only game that brought my family together. It draws people in because they don't have to do any really hard thinking - they can just choose from their hand of cards.  Also, it's easy to pull people into playing because you can just tell them, "It's ok...just hold these cards", and then later say, "Oh look, you get to judge!"  Before you know it, people go from watching to actually playing.  I can't help but love Apples to Apples.

A super bonus: Apples to Apples is the game that got me into board gaming!

Horrible, horrible, horrible party game.  I don't hate all party games, but I do hate this one.  Boring and repetitive it seems like each turn is the exact same, which wouldn't be bad.....if the turns were actually fun.

I originally considered this an excellent pick-up-and-play for gamers and non-gamers alike. However, time and repeat plays have convinced me that (a) the game boils down to choosing the card the chooser likes best, irrespective of the green "matching" card and (b) there are better games, for gamers and non-gamers alike.

It is a party game.  Given that, it needs a group that is hepped up and feeling goofy to be close to fun.  The judge mechanism is just too arbitrary for my tastes.  They're looking for funny one time and literal the next with no rhyme or reason.  I think I may play "I'm Thinking of a Number" or the slightly more challenging "I'm Thinking of a Word" at my next party.

As far as I'm concerned it's the equivalent of playing War with vocabulary flash cards, but at least in War you have some idea why you lost.

Really the only way to play (IMO) is with the lobbying rule, meaning you can lobby for the card you submitted.  Granted, revealing who submitted what card has its own inherent problems, but it's sure a lot more fun than sitting in silence hoping your card will be picked.  And also alleviates some of the frustration I feel when my card is clearly the best choice and the judge picks some other random card for some unknown reason. 

Edit: My kids love this game and it's enjoyable to play  with them and see their enthusiasm for it.

Updated update.  Played a 4-player game on Christmas Eve.  I think this game works well with 4, and gets worse with more.  I can handle it for about a half hour, then I just want it to end.

Update.  Played a 6-player game (2 players were age 9) on Thanksgiving.  Fun for about 15 minutes, and then the charm wore off with another hour to go.  The 9 year olds were severly handicapped by lack of general knowledge and had to be helped a lot.

Played one 8-player game.  Doesn't seem to be much to it.  You need the right crowd for this one, as the lobbying of the judge seems to be the only entertaining part of the game.

RATING: 8
Apples to Apples is my favorite party game (well, assuming the party has more than like 8 people and you know them all kinda-sorta well). It plays quick, is funny in a way that isn't contrived or embarrassing like most other party games seem to be, and yet it remains a GAME. I say this because there are other good party games that work well to generate conversation or jokes (the "Would You Rather" comes to mind) but aren't really GAMES.

My rating was a lot higher when I first played the game. Then I discovered that too many people simply pick out the card they like, instead of relating it to the adjective in some way. That's the only drawback, though. Otherwise, an entertaining game that non-gamers will play, and which can accommodate 4 players as easily as 10.

Still, lots of people just love it, and it can have its moments.

This game is similar to Cards Against Humanity, but is a family friendly version. I have loads of sealed taster packs for sale and invented my own additional rules for this in order to extend the game play life of the cards. Packs are for sale (including additional rules) at £3.99 each. Customers can buy in bulk for £2.99 per pack (for 10 or more) £1.99 per pack (for 50 or more) or £0.99 per pack (100 or more). Ideal for playing parties (as an ice breaker game), party bags, wedding gift bags, for use as a travel game, or giving as a complimentary gift e.g. as prizes at board game evenings etc. All the packs are the same and have 40 red apple cards, 5 green apple cards and quick play rules.

Apples to Apples and Cards Against Humanity... oh where do I begin. I want to like these games, as they are all that my non-gamer friends want to play when we get together. My enjoyment from this game is derived purely from what cards I get and how well I know the other people. Some games I get pretty unfunny cards. Some games the other players make references to inside jokes the whole time. I prefer games where subjectivity isn't the exclusive domain for playing.

I love this game. The best Christmas Day/T-giving game I own. Last Christmas my family was playing and the ages ranged were from 8-63 and everyone was having a ball.

This is an entertaining party game, especially with a group that knows each other well as they can "play the judge" with their red cards.

I absolutley hate this game.  I used to think I liked it, back when I could combine cards such as "Helen Keller" and "Touchy Feely."  However, once that novelty wore off this game had nothing left to offer.

The thing that really takes any enjoyment straight out of the game is the whole "you gotta play your opponent" idea.  EEEEFFFFFF that noise.  So stupid.  Your telling me that if I want to win I shouldn't play the card that everyone thinks is funny just because its the prudish boring guys turn and he's likely to pick something "realistic?"  Awful.

Okay party game that can play extremely large groups.  Its not a game that generally is extremely competitive as its more about just enjoying the experience.  Figuring out how people think is key if one actually wants to win...:-)  What is frustrating for me is when kids play and make decisions that appear totally random; when adults do the same, it practically drives me insane...:-)  While a solid large group party game, it now almost puts me to sleep if people are just silly with their choices.  Playing with the worm variant is a must anymore as well.

Amusing, and plays quick.  I didn't find it as hilarious as a lot of people say it is, but it keeps you smiling.  Our group is quite politically-incorrect, so certain cards will usually win you the round -- "Helen Keller", "AIDS", "Challenger Explosion" -- almost regardless of what the adjective is.  I wish there were more cards like that and less with names of pointless celebrities on it.  A "Meg Ryan" card is simply never going to win anything in our group.

Update:  lowered it a point because I don't really want to play it anymore.  I'd break it out in a group of people who'd never played it before, though.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
A very bad game.  It is so subjective that even if you have a card that is accurate or correct the judge can still pick something stupid or not even related (apples to oranges should be the title).

There's very little to this game, I admit, but it's a lot of fun and quite funny. If I'm going to play a "party" game, this is the one I'd prefer. It's not anything strategic, and a victory isn't anything fantastic (though a loss is also no big deal), but it's a lot of fun, something I value in a game.

This is another great game to rope in non-gamers.  We play with the "secret psychoanalysis strategy"; once the game ends, the green cards you hold reveal the things you are best at, and therefore your hidden personality.  That little bit adds a little zest for those of us who have played many times before.

I love the simplicity and intimacy of this game; playing with close friends can be a laugh riot! Unfortunately, you need 4 players to play and the game is a bit expensive. However, the concept is pure gold.

This is, quite possibly, the best board game I have ever played.

RATING: 7
This game is more fun than it should be.  It can get old after a while, but with a group of people, this game encourages lots of talking and laughter as completely ridiculous matches are made.  Since you only have to select the card, instead of having to come up with something yourself, this game works with even introverted and shy people, since you don't feel like you're put on the spot.  Since everyone plays each turn, there isn't too much downtime either.  There isn't much strategy to the game, but it does pay off to know the judge---as a result, it feels more like a psychological game rather than an analytical one.

I don't like this game, though most everyone else does.  (Mostly, I don't enjoy it b/c no one thinks the same as me and my cards don't get picked!).  Boxers and Briefs is a much better version of this genre.

Good party game.  I wouldn't want to play it for long though - about half an hour is enough.

Might be just me but I don't really like the speed version - it cuts out the creativity and makes it just too random for my tastes - maybe i'm just a bit slow.

A top-notch party game.  It doesn’t have the time pressure gotchas of many party games, and it’s great as a way to get to know your fellow players.  Beware that it doesn’t play especially well if you’re trying to “win.”

Apples to Apples is the ultimate party game. It's one of those rare games I can play over and over and never get tired of it. I've played the game with at least 50 different people and I have yet to meet a single person that doesn't like the game. 
 
The game is hilarious, fast paced, and takes only 30 seconds to learn. If your group doesn't enjoy this game, you're either playing it wrong, or you're borderline comatose.

Got this as a secret Santa gift at a family function.  This can be an entertaining party game, if you're playing with people that want to have fun.

As a modern classic when it comes to party games, I was a litle disappointed with this when I finally got around to playing it. It was a bit like Say Anything, but restricted. I thing I have been spoiled. Still, it was a good game. I would not buy it, but would play it.

[microbadge=50][microbadge=5322]

A popular party game, but it relies too much on knowing your friends than knowing anything, and knowing your friends might fall apart on their whim.  A good hand is impossible to maintain, since there's no way of knowing what will be good in future turns; there are no "bad" cards to just discard if you feel like you have nothing good to contribute.

I was a doubter, but found this in a thrift store for a buck and its paid for itself many times over in fun.  Only game my mother will play and actually have FUN instead of going through the motions to appease us.

After all the hype that I passed along to my group of friends (who I am desperately trying to get them to play something besides 10-9-8, better known as 'Oh H*ll'), I gotta say I was somewhat dissapointed. It will provide some amount of fun. But it just seems anti-climatic when someone wins, even when its me. I do like the fact that you cannot gang up on someone who is leading since you do not know who played which card.

I know that everyone loves this game, but I found this one fun, like most party games for the first 20-30 miniutes and then it was just tedious.  It can be fun joking about what was selected.

Do I like this game? Not really. Does everyone else seem to like it? Yes. And that's the reason I keep it. While non gamers that visit my house will recoil at my copy of Agricola, they will very happily play this light and easy game. So it's a crowd pleaser and a filler, and for that reason stays in my collection.

This is not a game that I think can be played competitively; it's really more of a social experience. However, as a social game, it suffers from dull moments where there aren't any particularly humorous combinations of cards. This is the fault of the game editors, and the game could easily replace some of the cards with less potential for humor (cancer, anyone?). The game does come with some blank cards which I recommend you use for whatever memes your group finds most amusing.

RETIRED: It's not really a game. We call it a "social mixer". Apples ROCKS as a simple method to get non-Gamer strangers to the table and having fun. Anyone can be playing in minutes. The concept is easy to teach and learn, even to people who don't normally play boardgames. We use it to see if people are interested in a gaming atomosphere -- if we get a positive response, we try them on Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne. More recently, we got rid of our original set and all the expansions and bought the party box, to save space. Unless you play very regularly, the party box has more than adequate variety. Also, don't make the mistake of bringing it out at holiday functions just because you have nothing else to talk about with your guests. A few hours of this game is definitely too much.

This is a fun game in a group.  You really end up playing cards to the person rather than things that were probably intended, but that's all part of it.  Just remember that, for the green card "Pure", the red card "Hot Lava" is the ultimate play because, as my group of friends decided, "What's more pure than Hot Lava?  Everything that touches it just becomes more Hot Lava.  Even the Ring of Power just became more Hot Lava!" =)

Revised: An interesting and fun game most played after holiday dinners with the family, mostly due to the laughs it generates.  Play variants allow it to keep some of its charm, but I can see where this could get old fast if played too much.

Great for the non-gamer crowd, but you really have to be in the right mood to enjoy it.  I win or at least do well every time, which belies the common claim that it's brainless and pure luck--it's all about knowing your opponents and playing the card you know they'll choose.  Can have some moments of sheer hilarity; nonetheless, my husband hates it.

Here's a nice variation when you get tired of the normal rules: Set the red cards aside. The judge selects TWO adjectives, and each player writes down any answer she wants within a set time limit. One player then reads the answers to the judge, who selects the one he likes.
For example: Enormous, fragile.
U.S. Economy.
Uncle Bill's ego.
Tower of Babel.
etc...

Nice party game that I have played mostly with kids, but it seems to work with whatever group I introduce it.  I rate it a 6 now only because I would prefer other party games like Dixit, but it is much quicker and easier to teach, so it stays in my collection.

RATING: 6
This is a genius wee game and way better than its crass younger cousin who thinks it's the cool one AKA Cards Against Humanity. Apples to Apples is quite dirty enough, and you actually have to use your imagination instead of having the humour spoonfed to you.

That said, I have a strict forty five minute limit play time on this game because everyone else I know would play it until the heat death of the sun.

RATING: 4
There was a long stretch where this was my absolute favorite party game, and I broke it out at every opportunity. Over time, though, it gets monotonous; I don't suggest it anymore, although I still have fun when we play it.

Say Anything does everything Apples to Apples does, only better. (Ditto with Wits & Wagers, although the comparison is less direct.)

Apples to Apples remains a great way to introduce folks who only play Monopoly (etc.) to other kinds of games. It's also a lot of fun with kids.

RATING: 3
A family game that others in my family like a whole lot.  I will play it versus not playing.  Often feels like you could roll a die to pick which item 'matches'.  I am not much for party games, but I will play when the 'group' wants to (maybe).  But sometimes I will simply sit out and wait for something other than a clear time waster.

Totally replaced by Dixit now.  Dixit is a party game, Apples to Apples is a party thing, but not really a game.

It's not that Apples to Apples is a bad game - I just don't feel like it's a game. I do like the idea of it, but the execution needs more competition and some sort of non-subjective judging.

I remember playing Boxers or Briefs and it being the same thing but better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The only reason I didn't give this game a higher rating is because my desire to play it depends largely on the group of people I'm with.  If at least most of the players know each other pretty well, I'd give it a 9.  If it's a group of casual acquaintances or strangers, I'd give it a 6.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game that has inspired so many imitators!  In it everyone has a hand of cards with a noun written on each.  The active player turns up/reads a card with a adjective written on it.  All the other players then secretly give the active player one of their cards, with a noun, that they think  best matches the adjective.  After everyone hands in a card the active player picks the noun card they like best.  Whomever put that card in wins the adjective card.  These adjective cards are counted as points and whoever has the most at the end wins the game.

I know what you're thinking...matching nouns to adjectives can't make for much of a game.  But what makes Apples to Apples fun is the unexpected combinations of cards that can be generated.  Some can be really hilarious.  Where the problem lies with the game is when nothing in your hand makes sense with the card read.  Unfortunately, this happens frequently.  Also, the game is super repetitive.  These factors drag its rating down in my opinion.

Nevertheless, Apples to Apples is a nice game to play once in awhile.  This would make a great family game, as the cards can be read, and interpreted, on many levels.  My favourite card in the whole game is, "Moist".  This of course could be used with so many things!

This game is Ok when you are with a group of folks new to gaming and don't know better games are out there. It can be enjoyable for a few minutes, but then you realize people are taking too much time deciding on which card to play when the winner of each round is COMPLETELY ARBITRARY.

This is our new favorite party game.  It is fun and requires no skill.  The variety of "rule varients" provided with the game promises to help this game stay fun even after you have worn it out.  The raiting is based on it being a party game and used for that purpose.  

Because it is so popular I've found I'm not always keen for playing it.  Time's up is my new favorite party game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Loads of laughs.  This game involves reading people's sense of humour.  The better you know them the easier the game is.  I find that in games where I don't know anybody, it's initially difficult, but as he game moves on, people usually play the same, and you can start to figure out what kind of cards they'll pick, and what kinds of cards they'll play.  This is a good pick for ice-breaking at parties...  although it could just help you realize how weird everyone is (but that generally just adds to the fun)

RATING: 6
A party game in which players play cards to match a card played by the juror (who changes with each turn). The cards have text on them and the goal is to make a funny/interesting combination so that the juror chooses your card.

I played it once. It was funny in the beginning, but got a little bland afterwards.

I think Dixit is a game with a similar concept which is much better.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very highly rated because this is a great game for non-gamers.  People who are extremely game-adverse will be quickly won over.  Non-competitive, very casual and great for laughs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Game in a Nutshell: Players alternate being the judge and flipping a card with a descriptive word on it. All others search through their hand to find and play the card that best fits the description. The judge chooses the card they like most, award the lucky contestant a point and keep playing until someone has enough points to win.

Played as: 5,6,7 players

Pros: One of the more tolerable party games for me, who generally despises the genre. It's easy enough that anyone should be able to understand and play after a 30 second explanation. After that, there's some good laughs to be had as well as some room for discussion. 

Cons: Highly objective and can't be taken seriously in the winner / loser sense of the word. Apparently doesn't hold too much interest after a while as I didn't get to play much early on, and couldn't find people who weren't already sick of it when I felt like a game.

Other: I always want to play this in a way that's open for debate but it seems like the times I've played, the judge bases their decision on card selection only and not by considering post-selection comments. 
I guess there's no forcing an unwritten rule, but I do believe it'd be more fun that way.

Best Use: At a party of non-gamers with six-ish people wanting to play.

Great warm up game- icebreaker when people are coming in...play humorous answers.....serious gamers see this is a waste of time, mindless, torture..

Non-gamers try to play seriously at times and get frustrated with others playing joke answers.

I enjoy this game for up to 20 minutes.

This is the way to drum up business. Jimmy and I walked into the Game Wizards and were invited into the game. I fell in love with it and Jimmy bought it for me right there. Most times they act like we're interupting them so we'll buy from RC Hobbies at a discount, their loss.

Unbelievably simple, unbelievable lack of skill involved, seems like it would be unbelievably boring to me.  So why do I have such a good time every time I play?  Because it's unbelievably hilarious.  This game isn't really about winning or losing, it's about having fun.  Truly a great social game.

RATING: 6
25/05/17 edit: While I thought this was excellent initially, there are other games out there such as "The Game of Things" that scratch the same itch but are more enjoyable. 

A good friend told me he got suggestions from friends and labelled the decidedly boring cards with new, funnier answers with a label maker- this is a great idea for some cards, however in The Game of Things you make all the answers yourself. That to me seems like a much better solution.

A very good party game.  We have played this many times with friends and family - not really caring who won, but enjoying the discussion along the way.  It is especially fun when you win a round because of a card that does not objectively match - because it matches the judge's way of thinking.

Perhaps one of the best party games ever. It has an extremely questionable level of
                                                   skill involved, but is a huge amount of fun, and reasonably plays as few as 4 or as many
                                                   as 10. This will continue to get pulled out for a long time. Often, this is a very amusing
                                                   and light note on which to end a gaming session.

01/04/2013: A fun, family party game.  The added humor from the comments on the cards adds to the enjoyment.  And easy choice for a family or group setting with its simple rules and light fun.  The words may be a little much for kids under 12 though - not risque or anything like that, but just a higher vocabulary level and knowledge of famous people and places.  If you have younger kids, go with Apples to Apples Junior instead.

I respect apples to apples as a pioneer for the non-stereotypical party game. The reason why is is lower on my list is because I believe games line "Say Anything" have come in and really replaced it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I guess my biggest problem with this game is that it's a party game.  This is a very popular party game and I can see part of the appeal.  I just feel like needing a game as an excuse to interact is a waste of time.  Just sit around and chat, that is more enjoyable than wasting time on a party game.

In Apples to Apples you are trying to put out a card you think the current player will pick.  They will throw down a card from the adjective deck and you will try and find the best card from your hand that matches, or at least that the current player thinks is the best.  Part of this is knowing the people playing.  Some people tend to pick the logical best choice, some people will pick one because they just sound funny together, of course the more inside jokes you have in common with somebody will get them to pick your card more often, etc.  Sometimes you just have horrible cards so you throw one out just to get it out of your hand.

As far as party games go, people can have a lot of fun with this because of the witty combinations players can come up with sometimes.  As I said before, I just don't like party games, so I have given this a low rating.  However, if you love party games, this is definitely one a lot of people will enjoy, just don't invite me to the party.

This is not a "gamer's game," however that doesn't make it a bad game.  Undetstanding/reading people well enough to know what a good choice is a skill and lends something beyond just pure chance to the game, but it's still very luck heavy.  However it is light, and very social in nature.  A good game for people in the right mood or in the right group, even if it isn't the best overall.

Really fun, even if really simple. I keep wanting to play this, but not everyone else seems to like it as much as I do. While it may not seem like there's a lot of depth to the game and it's mostly random, the consistent winners are the ones that can properly profile the judge. Even seemingly bad cards can be good matches if you can read people well, and for that reason it's a game I'll always want to come back to.

This is a popular game, with people of all ages, though we often have a "culture gap" as we get older, players get younger, and some kids just have no idea who Cesar Chavez is (for example).

One of two things happens in this game, and it always depends on the group of people: 

1. Everyone tries to be as literal as possible, and the game is really boring.

2. Everyone tries to be as funny / non sequitur as they can, and it's funny for fifteen minutes, yet the game drags on for an hour because people want their chance to be funny.

This game is terrible with a group of people you don't know pretty well.

Probably the best party game that I own.  Especially in a group of adults, the game can be very humorous and the variations are sometimes fun just to make things different.

The score definition is pretty bang on. What I will say is that this games fun (or lack of it) is exponential with relation to group size. Lots of people equal a fun game, fewer players around 4-5, and it's not worth it. Give "What?" a whirl if you ever think about playing AtoA.

Party Game where a player draws a card and states a word, name etc and the other players must say the first thing they can think of that has some sort of link to the keyword. The judge then decides which answer pleases them most, makes them laugh the hardest, is the best link etc

Game continues until a set number of points are won by one player. 

It's not bad but there are much better party games out there. This was probably king in the 90s but not anymore.

Perhaps more accurate to say "fun activity, usually willing to participate", since I don't generally try to "game" this at all when I'm playing.

I can't stand this game. Something that should be lighthearted becomes mean and vindictive. People try too hard to meta-game instead of just enjoying the cards. Then, when they see you own the game, it becomes the ONLY game they want to play. It requires no thought, and your best strategy is to sit quietly and try to read everyone at the table. Other games are so much more fun and encourage positive interaction.

This is a fairly benign party game in that it does not call upon individuals to engage in foolish behavior, or to be especially creative and therefore is more readily acceptable to a wider range of participants. It does however favor those players who know each other. It is particularly random with folks who don't know each other at all AND poor card draws can further handicap some players. It does have a nice level of interaction and it typically is worth some laughs.

Apples to Apples is a decent party game, and it is always a hit when it comes out.  But the truth is that there are better party games, as Apples to Apples doesn't scale very well across different ages, and a competitive player can ruin the game.  It's not bad, but not great either.  There are other party games that I'd rather play, and so Apples to Apples is just average.

A fine ice breaker game or for a larger group, but with a small group of well known people, it starts to get easy to tell based on type of humor who is playing what cards, defeating the point of the game.

Humorous, fun party game. Each turn, there is a judge who flips up a card. Other players, as quickly as possible play a card that is similar to that card. Judge chooses the "closest matching" card, whoever played that card scores a point. Rotate the judge and repeat until someone reaches a set number of points. Cards contain all sorts of adjectives and wide ranging personalities, leading to hilarious combinations. Since there are a limited number of cards, they will keep reappearing limiting the humor value as they reappear. The game was really fun initially, but it does lose some of it's fun value after a few plays. If you haven't played it, it's worth it for the experience.

RATING: 1
I gave this a 1, because I honestly feel that this game is broken. Someone will submit a card that 5 out of the 6 people playing will agree is the best possible match, but the 6th person is the "judge" and he won't pick that card because
a: he doesn't understand what that card means (or he doesn't know who it is)
b: he decides it would be "funny" to pick the card that is the worst possible match
c: he tries to read people's facial expressions when the cards are read so he can pick the person he likes

So basically since this game relies on being subjective it is broken.  Also, when I criticize the game, people who like the game make this claim - "If you're playing to win you're playing it wrong"  Doesn't that mean it's not a game?

I'm undecided about this game; haven't played it enough to really make up my mind. When I have played, it quickly changed from "pick the best answer" to "pick what the judge may think is best" to "pick a card and cross your fingers."

I don't believe my brother is a big fan of this game. At one point, he started selecting cards directly opposite of the category...and started winning hands. 

After more play of this game, I'm convinced this one can stay in the box. No strategy, not really even luck based.

A party game where the only real objective is to make everyone laugh.

This is the only game I've ever seen that my parents willingly stay up past their bedtime to play. It is an addictive barrel of laughs with the right crowd and the right number of players.  

Right crowd: those who can laugh, can openly/comfortably communicate with each other, can come up with reasons for choosing a card (as crazy as they want, not just "oh, I like it"), and those who can get into the game enough to not just blindly throw out cards.

Right #s: in my experience, 5 is great, 6 is amazing, and 8+ is really no fun.

My problem with Apples isn't so much that it's overplayed in general in my group, it's that once we get it out it NEVER STOPS. It outstays its welcome but nobody actually wants to stop playing it, so this light, fun, 30 minute game takes up 3 hours and has me clawing my eyes out by the end. The people I play it with are always saying "oh, let's play to 15, now!" Let's not.

Generally, an OK party game. Some cards will be duds, and I think people who play "Cards Against Humanity" first will find less opportunities to come up with clever answers to the topic cards played in this game. Subjectivity can create hit or miss decisions on who wins some rounds, especially if the judge goes against what seems to be public consensus on what cards are better selections than others. This game also depends heavily on the type and mood of the people playing.

This game seems to get people excited at a party.  
I am starting to find it redundant and annoying.  Take turns being the judge.  If you are a judge pick a card and read it, players will take a card out of their hand that corresponds to your originally pulled card.  Judge picks winner, rinse and repeat.

Fun to play at parties and good for non-gamers. Good filler. The simplest gameplay in the world: draw an adjective; pass nouns to the judge; judge decides which fits best. Example: Cool, are Icebergs cooler than Penguins than Frank Sinatra than the Pyramids than the City Dump?

This game is not my cup of tea.  Yes, it's mildly amusing for the first few rounds, but it quickly becomes tedious.  It's hard for me to even see it as a game, since a minimum of thought or resourcefulness are called for.  I hope I will never be asked to play this again.  (1+1)

RATING: 6
A fun party game but maybe a bit overrated. A lot depends on who's playing, as the person who's judging is supposed to select based on how closely a submitted word card matches the subject card.  But if people choose based on who has more or less cards, or for spite, or simply to be contrary, well, the fun can end pretty quickly. Or, playing it with somebody who thinks they're funny but aren't, and so on. (One time my wife and I played with a couple, the husband of which read out every answer and tried to be 'quippy' with each one, and we were close to either hanging ourselves or just shooting him.) Have played it with as many as 12 people. Basically, I'm usually okay with playing "Apples to Apples," but I don't go looking to play it. On the other hand, I can think of other group games I'd rank behind this. In my experience it seems to work better with larger groups, that is, 8-12 persons, and not so well with kids, who tend to get petty in how they choose winners--plus with the regular version they may not have enough education or awareness to be able to judge adequately (note that there's a junior edition for kids). My rating is 6, which is based on repeated plays with various people, and reflects my experience that most of the time when I play it, the game's enjoyable, but at times I'm indifferent even while playing, plus as noted, a lot depends on who you're playing with.

Call me a poor sport if you wish, but I don't enjoy this game.  I realize you're trying to figure out the best answer for your particular judge, but that's precisely what frustrates me.  I can play a card like Stovepipe Hat with Abraham Lincoln and lose to gummy candy.  Wait, what???  I finally started playing random cards from my hand, and that's when I started winning...  No, not my cuppa...

The only thing keeping this from being an 8 is the limited replay value.  You can only come up with Creepy Republicans etc. so many times.  Expansion sets help out with that, though.  I own the Crate edition with the first two expansion sets included.

Pointless party game.  People seem to enjoy laughing at the juxtapositions of the cards, but there's no strategy, there's no tactics, no skill, and the humour is not even very funny.  I'll play it at a party if I have to, but I'll intentionally try to lose because as much as I dislike playing this, I despise being the judge.

Apples to Apples is a fun party activity.  I hesitate to call it a game because it's completely random in who wins - with each person being a judge in turn, other than playing to their tastes (which is impossible sometimes, as their "taste" is completely arbitrary) you really have no chance of gaming the system.  It gets people talking and laughing, but is frustrating if you try and "win".  If that's not your cup of tea - and it's only mine sometimes - look for a more structured game.

I have gotten dyed in the wool "I don't play games" people to play this and have fun.The game can also be modified to work with younger children by chooing the red (or noun) cards before the green (adjective) card is exposed.  You'll be surprised at how many times appropriate matches come up.

RATING: 7
It's ideal as an opener or with family and friends, being a quick 'good mood' game that people can join as they walk in the door. We've had a lot of fun with it, and it's always good to have a game on hand that can take everyone in the group rather than split up into two tables immediately.

This game is very enjoyable as a party game if you have the right group of people. I need to stress that having the right kinds of friends is really, really important for this kind of game, and is what keeps it from getting a higher rating.

RATING: 5
The premise is interesting. One player (the judge) flips over a subject card and the other players through in a card with various different things written on it (from Chicago to Skydiving). The judge then picks the card they believe matches the subject best. You are encouraged to discuss while the judge decides, but you should not make it too obvious which card is yours. The problem is, that it is fairly obvious which card is yours and a judge can simply not pick the card of the leading player. If you can get past this and just discuss the merits of each card, then it is a little better. However it losses its appeal quite fast.

RATING: 7
Despite its simplicity, Apples to Apples can be a great source of laughs.  Because of the limited choices of cards in player's hands, players will often be forced to play cards that don't exactly fit the category, even with a large number of players.  That's where the fun begins, as card choices are rationalized with the judge's often bizarre logic.  This game is best played with a talkative group, as each card revealed can provoke some hilarious discussion.

We brought it along to our Thanksgiving Day gathering this year, and it was quite a success.  (An aunt in the family called my wife later to find out where she could find a copy!)  It's "only" a party game, but it succeeds wonderfully in filling that niche.  The only possible downside:  your group will need at least one person to be enthusiastic/boisterous/silly during the game.  If everyone plays it low-key, it can be a fairly boring experience.

For a game, there's not too much to this--match your noun with the adjective and be picked by the judge's decision.  If you're looking for a good gamers' game, this isn't it.

This game started a whole slew of similar mechanic games.  The mechanic known as the "Apples to Apples" mechanic --- which is to say, everyone plays a himorous card and one judge decides the best.  From the loathesome Cards Against Humanity to the wonderfully and beautifully abstract Dixit, Apples to Apples is responsible for them all. It is the original.  A word or phrase is given and each player plays a card from their hand to match the given topic.  Answers can be obvious to the riotously funny, but however you play, this game is a lot of fun.  And yes, helps to play with the rule that the last person to throw down a card is out of the round.  A2A is indeed dated now and has been replaced by many other games, but it still deserves its recommendation

This game is fun when you're sitting around with your friends drinking beers; no one cares who wins and it's funny. Playing it in any other situation is far less fun and can potentially be painful.

Who can play?  Party game for 3-many players.

This game just gets played again and again and again.  Up and running in 3 minutes, even with new players - and everyone always likes it.  We always play more than one game, and there's always laughing.  Laughing is good.

A classic and great game, but we burned out on it. It only makes the table when requested. I kind of dread when it's requested...
Update: I keep it hidden in a drawer. I don't bring it to game nights or generally tell anyone I have it.
Is that healthy?

Plays very plainly. You seem to have more fun picking cards that would make you laugh as opposed to what it should closely relate to. Hence, intro to cards against humanity. Yet another game that is a lot of fun with the right kind of people.

the trick with apples to apples is it's not about the truth, it's about what the judge likes the best.  it's a game about knowing your friends.  i really think the minimum number of people you should play with is about 7, and you should play until you get tired of it.  we used to play with like 15 or 20 people.  it's best if you have all the expansions.  and also you should leave the blank cards in there as blank cards.  because nothing is "spic and span" like "martha stewart's prison cell"

With how overplayed CAH is, I enjoy Apples to Apples because it isn't meant to be inappropriate. It's still a fun game but the concept has really been overdone for me. Enjoyable game, but not at the top of my replay list.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The objective is to match the best noun in your hand to the adjective placed by the judge. The judge then chooses his favorite answer and you essentially receive a point. So, you playing both a word game and a game where you as a player have to play to the judge's personality.

It's great fun and a barrel of laughs. Good for 4-8 players, and even more.

RATING: 5
After playing a game of this with some friends, my wife and I turned to each other and said, "This is it?".  Talk about a big letdown.  Sure, there was alot of debating and swaying about the card to choose, but there wasn't the same type of dimensional playing that really makes party games fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
VERY fun the first few times out, entertaining for a long time, then (for me) excruciating after you have owned it a year or two.  Short shelf-life, but a great gift for the occasional party gamer and truly a crowd-pleaser.

The game is okay.  The fun is trying to convince the judge that your answer is the best.  Some of the answers can bee real funny. A number of times, though, you don't have an answer that looks anything like the description (green apple) card, and it seems kind of dull.

RATING: 6
I've played this more than twice, I'm certain of it... guess I failed to record those plays on BGG..

Regardless, this game is OK -- I like it because anyone can play it (and large groups can play it quickly), but I dislike it because the winning card is picked by the judge - regardless of how closely it suits the adjective.

I don't own it, but I've played it several times.  I really don't mind playing it again, but only because it can suit a lot of people, can be played quickly, and can be put away fairly quickly as well.

RATING: 6.5
I don't much like party games.  But if I had to play one, this is ok.  Mainly because I like to ignore the fact that you're trying to win, and just try to pick the card that gets the most laughs each round.  As such, I ignore the game, and play my own little mini-one-player-game of seeing how many rounds I can get the biggest giggle from my card :-)

I like apples to apples.  It's a great game for everyone!  Before I bought this copy from my friend, I actually borrowed it when I went to my hometown (in NJ, i'm in RI) and played it with some friends.  One of them loved it so much, that she got a copy of it! :-D  And honestly, I don't remember laughing that hard in a while.

However, it is important to play with the right group of people (not people who will take it too seriously)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This game can be fun with the right people.  I guess I get tired of people that only pick crazy answers that have nothing to do with the card they orginally played, which takes away any fun value and makes the game a 'just pick brain-eating zombies for things that are blue cause it's stupid and funny' kind of game, and then what's the point?  I can think of better games to play.

RATING: 6.5
This is a solid party game.  Simple, fun, and replayable.  Easy to learn, easy to play.  A favorite of my non-gaming friends.  Expansions are needed if you play it repeatedly. Does get a bit old after a while though.  Since discovering Dixit, I don't really feel the need to bust this out that often.

RATING: 6
Update: A recent playing with almost a full player count has hit home this design is sparse on laughs (and sometimes inappropriate) it really needs extrovert attitudes (especially the judge in the spotlight) to fill in the gaps. It also seems some adjectives have a better potential to create humourous associations such as filthy or offensive vs handsome or talented. So there is now a feeling this is a hit or miss affair.


A rarity in game genres: an icebreaker, which almost goes down well with every group I've introduced it to. 

I say almost because firstly there has to be enough cards thrown into the middle to make any hilarious comparisons (hence with less than 7 players I'd prefer players being allowed to contribute 2 cards, the slowest player only allowed one). 

Secondly, the players need to turn off their competitiveness (it's only an icebreaker) and just associate for humour's sake rather than criticise the lack of skill, though considering who is judging is important: a male would be less likely to consider FIREFIGHTERS as MASCULINE. 

Typically, alcohol makes this game hilarious. Suffering alittle from familiarity, so not as fun as it used to be. Yet what still makes this game enjoyable are the receptive players' reactions to the cards played (or not played) such as the confused look or the improv humour-you can't pick PENGUINS for being UNCOOL, because they are, well, cool. 

It stays in the collection as it can cater to a large, family setting of different age groups and abilities with no emphasis on doing charades or being good with describing. I have the crate edition, which has alot of Americanisms removed because they make it difficult to relate to.

Such a simple game for parties.  I don't know any group of non-gamers that did not like this game.  Read that again.  This game is not for the nerd that is seeking orcs and goblins.

This is your stepping stone to all the "relationship" games. Cards Against Humanity, Joking Hazard, the T-shirt game, Snake Oil, etc. 
In fact, it's a running joke that when I teach ANYTHING, the first question I ask is "Have you played Apples to Apples?". 

This is a fun game for a relaxed atmosphere; don't take your game too seriously or you might have many a "how in the heck?" moments.

I can understand why a lot of people don't like this game, given that it is more an accessory for humourous interaction, more akin to truth or dare and story telling games.

If I'm in the mood for some Eurogaming, this won't hit the spot.  However, if I'm just in the mood for a really good time getting to know my friends just a little bit better, this is a grand old time.  I always play with the "everybody can put down a card," varient.  As long as people don't take forever, this does well to make the cards put down quite a bit better.  The "face down" varient makes the game much less personal, and helps to avoid not chooisng a player just because they'll win.  I also mix in the blank cards for this house rule: Discard a blank red to discard your entire hand and refresh.  If you draw a green card, you get to make up what it says right on the spot.  My favorite create-a-green is "Like Me"

Don't listen to the haters. In some ways, this is the best game of all time. This is the perfect game for non-gamers, and if you bring the right cards and the right attitude, even a Eurogamer, Wargamer, or Ameritrash enthusiast can enjoy this. You have to accept that you can't control your fate; the winner is 99% random, but deciding which card to play for each round is hilarious and fun. This game should be a part of anyone's collection.

We thought this was the cat's pajamas when we played the prototype (Apples to Oranges).  We thought that rule of last-one-in-is-out was so cool.  Well, that only cuts it for so long.

I pretty much loathe Apples to Apples. The winner is really in no way dependent on skill, indeed throwing in a random card has almost an equal chance of winning as does a carefully picked selection. Therefore I suppose the point of the game is simply to have fun and laugh at the combinations that arise, but that's not the type of fun I'm looking for when I sit down to game. There are plenty of other good games that try to foster plenty of social interaction and laughs while gaming and do so in a game that actually offers meaningful decisions.

Awful.

I particularly like party games. The minimum that a party game should do is inspire creativity, This one does the opposite -- rarely anyone finds strange word combinations amusing. So the game becomes about being the lucky player to have the most bland noun card at the right time.

For word association games, Scattergories beats this easily.

Apples to Apples is a decent game.... it is a good party game when you want or need a lighter filler to set the tempo for the evening.  My wife LOVES this one however and I would suspect that some of my friends would rate this game higher... in the 6, 7 or 8 range.   And for a party game, it might deserve those ratings.  I find the game a little bit to dry for my tastes and decidedly average.  Not bad...just average.
To me, the more it is played, the more dry it becomes.

I like party games.  This one surprisingly is rated high for a party game on the Geek, but it is not nearly as good as others like Taboo.  Actually I do not even think it a good game and would never choose to play it.

Very light, very quick, very fun card game, where winning doesn't really matter.   A winner with mixed crowds, although probably too light for a heavy gaming crowd.  Wonderful for parties and get togethers involving non gamers.

RATING: 4
my favorite party game. i love the way this game integrates social interaction with game play. it never feels like you're playing a game when you play this with people. i know there's not much to this game rules-wise like most party games, but whenever i play other party games, like taboo, i still always feel like i'm playing a game first, and socializing second. i never get that feeling while playing this. warning: this game will sink like a stone with people who don't have a skewed sense of humor. can become a bit played out, but i can't think of a party game that isn't true about.


Update: This is one of those games that is really fun for a while, then just sort of burns out really quickly. This seems true for a lot of people for whom this game was once a lot of fun for. Most people I know who would suggest this game, would never play it now.  There's not a lot of game here, I suppose and once the initial novelty of the initial plays wears off, there's not a lot left to keep people interested I suppose. Rating lowered.

Although party games are not really about winning the scoring in this is far too frustrating to be much fun. Also, there is just no reason to play this when Dixit does the same thing better and with beautiful art.

Play for 20 minutes. Have a good laugh. Put away quickly. That's the trick with party games that have such a slight premise. Great for non-gamers and the perfect ultra-light party game. Making your own cards is even better, particularly if you live outside the US.

Great party game and a very good game for the ESL classroom.

Goes great as a drinking game along side Kings cup and other such games with lots of antics.

And on the flip side it can be used with middle school and up aged ESL students to help build vocabulary and teach how to use adjectives in English.

I purchased this game way back when it first came out and I think it's been the most consistently played game in our collection every since.  However, it's starting to get a bit dated so we've changed a couple of the "people" cards to represent a younger audience.

I really, really dislike this game.  I know it is loved by many but I just really don't enjoy the gameplay, the scoring, or... well.... the game.   If Apples and Oranges are truly opposites, then Oranges to Oranges might be my favorite game ever... get on that people!!!   Make it so!

I have the Finnish version of this game called "Kuin kaksi marjaa". Nowadays this can be found on the shelf of our summer cottage. The game is published by Tactic and the cards are unfortunately of bad quality. This is a very simple party game geared for non-gamers. Rules are almost non-existant and it plays very fast. The game is fun until you get to know know the cards and the fun starts to wear out. And that won't take too long.. Too bad that there are only English expansions for this. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Not necessarily a bad game, I just do not care for it. It is just frustrating when you have a combo that goes together so perfectly but they just pick whatever the most ridiculous nonsense answer is. Not my kind of game. I keep this only for my wife.

RATING: 6
This is a fun, light-hearted game that's best played with many people.  It can be quite thought-provoking and, at times, humorous.  The person whose turn it is to read the description can have a tough time choosing, but for everybody else, there isn't much thinking involved.  I imagine it would have a lot of replay value, but my group of friends prefers competitive strategy games, so we don't play this much.  I think it's important to keep who submits what items a secret, and it's in a player's best interest to champion for their own without making it too obvious (often times, discouraging a competing option works best).

It's an all-around good time.  Easy, fairly quick, not too involved or too fast paced, and very approachable for new people.  Guaranteed to stimulate a conversation!  Don't expect a deep game with lots of strategy and don't feel bad if you don't win.  This is less of a game and more of an ice breaker.  It's not about winning and losing; it's about having a good time.

Still, for the price, you can get a lot more mileage out of other games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a fun party game.  I love that it's more about knowing the people you are playing with than knowing words.  It's a good time.

***Update***

After playing Dixit, Apples to Apples has lost something.  I'm not as amused by random silliness because I know that I could be playing something with similar mechanics that is an actual game.  Plus the artwork in Dixit blows the pants off the crappy drawings of apples.

I liked this game at first.  But this is just about the only boardgame my son will play.  The children seem to have no rhyme or reason to what they choose, but there must be a pattern because Mom can always feed them the right card, and she wins every single time.  For me this game has gone beyond tedious.  But I love my son, so I do play it.

I admit, if there was a group of adults who wanted to play I'd give it one more shot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Simple party game suitable for non-gamers.
The judge for the round chooses a card to be the topic/subject & all players choose the best card from their hand to fit/answer the topic. Whoevers answer the judge chooses gets the point.
It's the clean/family-friendly version od Cards Against Humanity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Fun party game, even non-gamers enjoy themselves playing this.  You can explain the rules in less than a minute.  For the cost of the game I think they should have had better quality cards.

Update: After a few more plays this has gotten boring.  I'll still occasionally play it but not very often.

Update: I hope to never have to play this again.

I'm beginning to like this game less and less as a party game.  It's biggest asset in my book is that it can support any number of players and can be played comfortably, with everyone just lounging around.  I would much rather play Time's Up! then this game.

I've also noticed that it's very hot and cold, not providing a consistently great experience or a consistently awful one.  Sometimes it's hilarious and brilliant, and other times it's just kind of flat.

Good party game.   My kids tell me that the green cards you collect describe you.  This adds an interesting dynamic to the game!  :)

We recently pulled this out for a game.  The whole time I was thinking to myself:  "we should be playing Dixit" If you like Apples to Apples, try Dixit, which is the same thing with pictures rather than words (and more creativity involved as well).

An outstandingly simple and fun party game that non-gamers, drinkers, non-drinkers, and gamers can all play together!  Length is short, although extended based on group laughter.  No table is required to play so it works really well in big groups in say living rooms or even outside.  I would give it a 10, but if a gamer plays it to many times in a row, I find it to become dull. Highly Recommended!

With the right crowd and the right mindset, you can't help but have a decent time kibitzing about which card should be chosen.  However, throw in one bad apple (pun intended) and the wheels fall off, hence the lower rating.  The more I play this, the less I want to get it to the table again, but it's definitely served it's purpose over the years.

I almost consider this broken.  It clearly becomes a game with an implicit rule of "whoever is funniest wins".  Which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but with 1 or 2 people who are super conservative or just don't "get comedy" it's a REALLY bad experience.

This game and all like it can go straight to hell.

One of the rare games that's pretty much guaranteed fun with absolutely ANY group.  The original edition didn't come with quite enough cards for many repeated plays, but the Party Box edition available now, which incorporates the first 2 expansions, should be enough cards to extend the game's half-life substantially.  It's the ultimate no-stress game.

Players: 4-10
Time: 30-45 min.

Party game for large groups in which players take turn drawing a "green apple card" which is an adjective and the other players play a "red apple card" which is a noun, from their hand. The judge, without knowing who played which card, must decide which noun most appropriately fits the adjective. The player of the winning card gets 1 point. For example, if I as the judge drew "Spooky", and you played "Diana Ross" from your hand, you would get the point. Knowing the judge and their opinions obviously helps. Game ends when someone reaches a pre-determined number of points.

Good family game that brings nongamer family members together with you to spend time playing a "game". Can generate some good humor depending on who is playing.

Dislikes
This game bores me to no end even given the occasional funny moment created by some crazy combination of cards. The game is just too simple to be fun beyond a couple of rounds and unfortunately it usually goes on and on and on and on. I only play this when my children and/or other family members ask to play. Then the plastic smile comes out...

That said, I'm still keeping it because it's incredibly accessible and there are non-gamers who request it.


From 2007:
This is a good party game.  The more the merrier! The simplicity of the game makes it very accessible and playable no matter how awake or "with it" you might be. And some of the in-jokes you can create with the cards can be hilarious.

This is a game that I am ALWAYS requested to bring to large get togethers. It can handle any number of players. I've played 4 player games of this and I've played 15 player games, and it works well with both.

Always spawns lots of laughs. Light, quick playing and very accessible. Great party game.

RATING: 3
As with all party games - so much of the game mood depends on the people involved.  While this game can be an interesting diversion for a large group, the "randomness" of judging means that this is ultimately a game wherein one has very little control.  In other words, its an activity not a game.  (Much prefer Attribut as the social word game of this ilk.)

Enjoyable party game with limited replay unless you play with different  groups. Played British and American versions, which are very different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
For three people, everybody holds 10+ cards, and two cards each are played per turn.  That way there are four cards to choose from instead of two.  Still only a 50/50 shot, but better than no game at all.

At the end of the game, one remaining player will always have two remaining cards in his/her hand.  The judge chooses between them and two random cards from the red deck.  It's all luck by the time you get to your last cards anyway, so what the hell.

RATING: 6
I think this game is hilarious and fun.  You can't ask for much more in a party game.  I've only played this a few times so far, so I can't respond to the comments about whether the novelty wears off.  I think you definitely need the expansions though -- even with only a few plays, I've already seen the same match up a couple times.
-----------------------------------------------
Update:  after a few more plays, it's not so much that the novelty wears off, but the "bad judging" starts to get really annoying.  Also, without any expansions, the base game is only good for 2 back to back rounds.  Don't play a third round (at least not with a large group) because you will start seeing the same cards come up again.

a good way to pass the time with the in-laws. they've never heard of Cards Against Humanity, but they're no slouch finding the sex and politics in just the base apple game. if you need this game, i'd recommend buying the very newest version so you don't miss out on updated celebrities and such. it's definitely a touch that'll be appreciated by this game's target audience.

This is more of a party/social game experience than an actual game, although ostensibly it is a game with scoring points.  It can be mildly amusing in a party pastime kind of way, but I would never choose to play it when I want to play a game.

This is the version that came out before the apple crate edition.  I have all the sets (I am starting to question if I bought a couple of them twice, with the card repeats I've been seeing!) but they are a bit scattered.  I am honestly finding apples to apples cards everywhere at the most unexpected times, so I have no doubt that this set is incomplete.  If you know the game, though, you know that missing a red card or five has no effect on playability.

RATING: 3
This was a clever game system back in the day, but at this point I am just tired of playing it.  There are simply too many cards that are not, and never will be funny, no matter how they are played.  One of these is bad enough, but when you have a whole hand of them, it's no longer fun. 

I also have, more times than not, played with the wrong groups, who approach this game in a very literal way instead of having fun and choosing the most amusing answer, and it absolutely kills the experience for me.  They also typically seem content to play it for the entire evening, while my fun meter is beyond pegged with this game after half an hour.    

I appreciate this game's widespread appeal, very easy for all ages and non-gamers to jump into a fun party game.  I also am a fan of word games, but this game is a dud for me anymore.  There are much better party games out there.

Lest I hate the game too much, though, I will admit it's given one of my biggest laughs in party gaming- someone turning in "Helen Keller" for "touchy-feely"

Nobody on BGG likes Apples to Apples (me included), but that's *the* game that works in a "I don't know what the he** to expect" social situation. It works with no table. It works when there's a wind blowing. It works when half the players aren't paying attention, the other half can barely understand frickin' checkers, and at least two people have to take a tinkle or check their email (again). Wallflowers can just watch for few minutes, then you shove some cards into their hands and they can play. They can stick the cards on the table when they're shoving food into their mouths, they can hold the card while they're texting on their iPod. If they drop the card into the fruit salad, you can still play the game.

This is a great way to get to know the tastes and senses of humor of the people around the table at parties.  Playing to the judge is key to this game and it makes for a lot of fun since everyone gets to be "it."  There are also almost innumerable cards for this game--there are literally several crates worth that you can get.  There are also variants for younger kids and a bible version apparently! (Woah, that's a bit much for me but apparently A2A can be good for church gatherings.  Thank you, Amazon, for this knowledge.  

But never fear, it can also get quite raunchy/off-color/politically incorrect if that's your style. :) The flavor text is great too.

Most people will enjoy this game - my wife and her friends love it.  But there are too many cards with references I do not get (they aren't funny).  Additionally, I don't think there is enough player interaction - if you have a mixed group (i.e. her friends and my friends) it will be the cliques that will interact the most because of inside jokes from playing this game so frequently.

I got in on a game of this late at a party, but just from playing a couple of turns I could tell this is a fun one. There is social interaction that comes from trying to figure out what the Referee is likely to favor, or what someone who is ahead is likely to submit. And this game is stress-free, unlike some other party games with timers or real-time aspects.

I'm not a fan of the game because of the level of subjectiveness (real example from a past game, my answer of "babies" was not selected on the adjective "innocent" because the answer "Jupiter" made the judge giggle).  For what it's worth, it plays best without the expansions.

Spontaneous girlfriend-approved purchase while shopping at Target. This game is an excellent choice for non-gamers who want a low-commitment party game for kids and adults with simple rules. Players take turn being a judge. The judge draws a green card and reads the word aloud ("pretty" for example), along with the three provided synonyms. Each player has seven red cards, from which they select and play one face down. Each red card names people, places, and things ("the 1950s," "policemen," "Uma Thurman," "farts," etc). The judge gathers up all the red cards, reads them aloud, and chooses the red card that they best feel matches the green card. The player of that red card is awarded one point, and after a number of rounds someone wins from obtaining a predetermined point total. There's some strategy here in trying to understand how the current judge thinks, and when a card is better off kept for a subsequent round or needs to be "burned off." But really this is all about matching things and descriptions, and that in itself is kinda funny. It's worth a laugh, is a great opener, and works well whether it's played by kids, adults, or any mix. Best played with a large number of players.

Here's an example. In one round, I was the judge and read "handsome" off the green card. The other four players played their red cards. My choices were "Demi Moore," "Men In Black," "ice cream," and "toes." I immediately discarded toes, to no surprise of anyone, including the card player who claimed "You know you have a bad hand when toes are the most handsome thing you have." Ice cream is delicious, but given the competition here really has no chance. Ultimately, I reasoned out loud, Men In Black is clearly the best match for handsome. To call Demi Moore handsome is akin to calling her comely; Wil Smith and Tommy Lee Jones win out from masculinity and quality attire. This elicited a humorous and spirited debate by the Demi Moore player, which fell on deaf ears because my mind was decided. The ice cream player then asked if we had any handsome ice cream...

UPDATE 9-27-09: In the right group, this game is hilarious, although I would take a breather between plays. I played with some people who picked their answers based on how much the answers appealed to them, regardless of the green card they were supposed to judge it by. This strips away the essence of what makes the game great (comparing unlikely things) and turns it into one boring revelation after another (you like soap more than Worcestershire sauce, good to know). Since I can avoid playing this with that player, I am happy to keep my rating at 8.

This game has a Madison, WI connection via John Kovalic, illustrator of Munchkin, and has a long popularity here. My wife cleans up on this game! It seems like every time we've played she has won. We have the sweet deluxe wood case edition.

Heard complaints that people who adore this game play this to death and the game never ends until it's time for bed. Correct. But even 1 or 2 rounds is unbearable. There is almost no creativity in this game, as you are hamstrung by the cards you draw, both as the judge and as the proposer. Say Anything, Dixit etc have left this game in the dust. Now if only the unwashed masses can catch on.

Nothing particularly special about this title. The kids enjoyed it so it made it to the table more often than it probably should have. Now that they are older we seldom if ever play Apples to Apples.

RATING: 7.5
Apples to Apples -- Great fun the first few times it is played with any group.  However, the addition of new words in the expansions does not increase replayability as much as one might hope.  Still, this game has broad appeal.  My brother-in-law doesn't like games but loves this.  Also, his wife teaches English for Speakers of Other Languages using Apples to Apples Junior.

RATING: 5.8
The only time I have really enjoyed this game was when we played with the "last person doesn't get to put in a card" rule so it went very quickly. The chooser read through all the cards and everyone was able to try to convince the chooser of which card to pick. Highly dependent on the group and being able to read people. Dislike how some groups consider there to be "auto win" cards even if they don't make sense. Dislike when people just read the cards silently and pick one. Dislike having to wait for people. Now that cards against humanity is a thing there is little reason to play this game except where children/the easily offended are involved.

It is a silly party game that people of all ages can enjoy.  With the right atmosphere and crowd, it is destined to be a hit.  Beyond a family-friendly engagement, however, the game doesn't have much to sink your teeth into.

RATING: 4
In our family, it's a game of trying to give points to your favorite player, not about the game mechanic (their house rule is "no lobbying" - so the lobbying ends up being coughs and winks). Annoying usually.

A good party game, especially when the players already know each other well and you can do lots of in-jokes.  We often play with the rule that everyone can play a card, they just have to do so quickly, to ensure everyone can participate but the game still moves along.  Judging the answers is pretty arbitrary but a good source of amusement.

What was once the most highly requested game in my collection has sadly fallen of it's high horse over time.

Initially, this incredibly easy, drop in and drop out party game allowed for lots of laughs and debate while also accommodated as many players as you could ever want in a game.

While this used to be a go to game for family events and large group gatherings, over time and after many, many play-throughs this gem lost it's sparkle. To be completely honest, and as much as I may be criticized for it, the release of Cards Against Humanity completely annihilated the need for this game.

Can really fall flat depending on who you're playing with.  People can come up with really weird judgments, so you feel robbed.  Or worse, they can be almost arbitrary, which means it doesn't matter what you play.  Yea, I'm putting a card on the table and hope that it gets picked.

Guess a 5 is right.  I've had fun with this game but don't seek to play it.  We had a copy of this well before we moved into the new BGG world of non party games.  I certainly wouldn't turn down a game if it is the only thing people are into playing.

Looking to Trade:  All our friends have this anyway so would love to clear up some space for a new game.

This is one really fun party game. Explainable in 1 minute. In fact, you can just deal newcomers 7 cards and say, "When he (she) lays down a green card face up, play one of your red ones face down".

I really enjoy this game a lot especially since you can play it with just a few people or a lot. My girlfriend and her friends always play this at their role playing parties; the way they spice things up is they always choose different characters and their characters chose the cards. Either way, it's really fun unless you play it a LOT... then it just gets old...

Lot's of fun.  Play it if you are feeling silly.  Works well with booze. I think that the first 30 or 40 times you play this it will seem the perfect party game. For me, it perhaps became overplayed. Still though, I think that for nongamers this remains one of the greatest social games around. 

Ultimately, Attribute is the better game though.

Didn't like it.  I found that game to be pretty stupid and absolutely arbitrary.  The "slap the card down faster than your opponent" thing was nothing but annoying.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The outcome of this game is completely subjective to the whim of the shallow group that plays it.

If you are playing against a group of people that are at all interested in winning or being "serious" there is no strategy or way to beat them fast just to get the game over with. As the ego-centrists drag the game ad nauseum, you'll feel yourself being dragged into a nonobjective black hole of stupidity.
If you find yourself lucky enough to play with an agreeable group, you're better off just having a nice conversation with them.

Similar (but much better, more logical and non-subjective) alternatives would include Scattergories, Balderdash.... or even calvinball

Furthermore, this game contains no useful bits to cannibalize towards making something useful. The cards were cheaply printed, and since thats the only thing besides the box itself, its nearly worthless.

I would have rated this game a zero, but it gets a bonus point for resale value or if you feel like doing the human race a favor its possible to take it completely out of circulation by re-skinning the box and putting another game inside after discarding the previous contents.

Only fun for me if we play a variant where we have to explain the reason we chose the cards we chose. I don't see any point playing the original game. Throwing down cards for the sake of throwing down cards isn't fun. Even if "George Washington" is "Sensual" just because.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Rated after first play.  May raise my rating after further plays, but since I am not really a fan of party games, that may be a while. I was probably expecting a little more serious intellectualism with the game.  It seems like no one else really made any attempt to play anything close to the target card each turn, so it was really up to the whim of the one choosing each turn, which I felt was way too chaotic.

A great party game that is never the same game twice...............unless you get a blank card that someone writes something too good on to ever erase.  There are a couple of those in my game, and they provide laughs every time they come out.  Although, I have to say, now that I have Cards Against Humanity, this game is too vanilla for me now.

Never had a bad session of this game. Everyone I have introduced it to has wanted more. 

Its always intriuging seeing how different people will approach the game and I've been amazed that very often the most unlikely candidates have turned out to be extremely shrewd judges of character.

RATING: 4.2
Components - 1/1 Straightforward, box is fine, uses just cards (which are of acceptable card stock) and the rules are straightforward enough.

Fun - .5/1 Honestly this is so highly dependent on group. I've played a game where only the most literal would be chosen. This game went on for hours. That is by far one of the most painful gaming experiences I've had. When the group is good, the game can be fun in short increments. Overall, there's just too many non-applicable cards that make the game an exercise in waiting for those few actually funny/tense choices.

Replayability - .8/1 Quite the large collection of cards, and since the game is all about what cards are in your hand when the particular green card is chosen, there's quite a lot of different combinations that occur.

Strategic - .3/1 A lot of luck of what is in your hand versus what is out there. Generally you only have an option or two that really applies. Most of the strategy revolves around playing the picker.

Theme - .1/1 There is no theme in this game. The apples are on the cards and box, but outside of the name's implication to the game being played, there is no theme that comes through.

Personal Review - 1.5/5 The concept for this game is good, but the problem is that the cards you have in your hand frequently have little to do with the card picked, leaving with you generally a single option to play. This then becomes less of a game and more of an exercise of luck. There is much better executions of this style game in my mind.

When you get tired of/grow out of the Cards against Humanity vibe, but love the game metric, this is a great game to play. Recommend: changing the rule, so that people can argue for their card.. much more fun and hilarity

RATING: 6
It's a good party game, but you really have to play to the judge. I'm not so good at that :(. You have to know the judge and get in their heads, which I often don't do well. When I'm forced to play, I do end up having fun, so I'm bumping my rating up to 6. One thing everyone should know: at the end of the game, look at the apples you've collected. All those words describe YOU!

Interesting light game that can make you think outside the box and see how people's minds can work so differently from each other.  An above average social game.  Update:  my rating keeps dropping as I play it more.  It's too random and I'm not much of a party game person to begin with.

This is a fine party game.  I remember being originally impressed by how much I liked it and the elegance of the simple system.

It is just completely overshadowed by Cards Against Humanity and Dixit I will always want to play one of those two rather than this now.

RATING: 6
I loved this game the first time I played it.  It was a big hit with everyone and always generates a lot of laughter.  I have a zany mindset and try to justify outlandous cards to the judge.  It's lost some of its appeal but the kids adore this.  Some of the card words were too difficult for my kids when they were younger so we also picked up Apples to Apples Jr.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a popular party game. It tends to be more fun when you play with people you know as you can tailor your card choice. I would like this more if game only lasted 10-15min. When I play this at parties, the game tends to drag on too long (45+ mins). No strategy or skill required as the whole game is play a card, draw a replacement, someone reads aloud all the answers and picks one, repeat. I prefer Times Up as a party game.

I love to bring this game out when people want something to do. It's simple, EVERYONE can figure out how to play, and there is always something funny happening.

And it must be a game that is liked by a lot of people. I know this because my original copy was stolen out of my car. Someone broke in, stole my ipod, and this game. I got a new one

I bought this after another teacher described it at lunch in gushing detail. It sounded perfect for my AP Language class to play while ostensibly practicing rhetorical strategies. (Which, to their credit, sometimes they actually did!) Sadly, I've not only never played it myself, but I don't know what the real rules are. (I can say that it's pretty brilliant in a classroom with people who are willing to make deeper connections and animated arguments.)

A fun party game that is somehow made more fun by playing "doubles". Or by playing "opposites". Or "double opposites", though that somehow seems to be the step too far, usually. Good for a few laughs, but is best only played for a few rounds. Otherwise, you're beating a dead horse.

It's fun in its way, depending very much on the group.  A group of literalists can be pretty dull.  On the other hand, you'll have some judges who take the least appropriate entry every time.  Somewhere in the middle is good.  I like playing the speedy variant, where one player gets left out each turn (if you have 5 players competing, only the first four entries are taken).  It adds a little zest.

I find this to be a VERY circumstance-dependent game.  Played with strangers, I'd give it a 2, maybe a 3 if they were warmed up.  Played very infrequently with good friends or family it could go as high as an 8 or even 9 with the right mix.  Played as a regular filler game for game night, it would drop back down to a 2.

Upshot, great with the right people at the right time, dull and drudgery under other circumstances.

Comparing this game to other party games is like comparing apples to oranges, since most party games require that you do something a little more interesting or creative than just throwing a card onto a table.  But like other party games, my main goal is not to select the best card that will potentially give me points, but rather the funniest card that will potentially get a laugh.  In its favour, it's a great game to play with younger and/or stupider kids since the game's strength lies really in it's simplicity and it's at least fun to watch the kiddies enjoy it.  But for adults, it's not a lot of fun unless you happen to win the chance to be the one selecting the cards, which I don't because I'm too busy trying to find the funniest ones.  Game design: 2.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 4.5/10

Great party game but I feel like it needs to be played in short spurts rather than over and over again; around the third or fourth round, I think the uniqueness tends to wear off.  Like The Big Idea, most of the fun here is in the bickering and debating about why "Sweat Socks" are more "Luminescent" than the "Desert," or whatever.  So it boils down to, largely, a BSing game.  But it's definitely fun when taken at that.

Also, totally honestly, better with some alcohol.

Fun party game but there's one major flaw: there's no way to prevent people from simply slapping down random cards.  If you get enough people doing that it simply devolves to a contest of who can slap their card down the fastest.

This game is a bit of fun and some good laughs.  However I don't really like party games.  This game is actually quite ridiculous because you don't need to play a card that has anything to do with the topic to win.  I'll play it if asked, but I really don't want to.

Christmas present 2010.  Everyone else seems to like this so how bad can it be?  Maybe it will get them wanting to play real games.

******EDIT******

I hate this if it lasts for more than 15 minutes.  It's funny for like 3 rounds and then I just hate it.  I'd rather sit and watch mens synchronized swimming.

Alas, I can't get rid of it because it was a christmas present from my best friend.  Perhaps I should rethink that classification.

I pretty much despise all games like Apples to Apples, where your goal is just to come up with something funny or clever and a judge picks the funniest/most clever card played. I'm not sure why I hold such strong opinions. Probably because must of the time, they break down into bathroom humor.

Fun party game that shows its age from so many clones of it (some that do it better). One player (judge) flips an adjective card and everyone plays the best noun card from their hand to match. Judge then picks what he/she feels is the best fit from cards played.

A poor man's Dixit.

It clearly requires less effort as you don't need to think of a clue etc, but with no abstractions, it is also possible to have multiple rounds where your cards are no help whatsoever.

We had too many rounds where everybody (playing with 6 IIRC) just dumped a card and the reader essentially picked a random answer from 5 terrible options.

A fun party game that introduced me to the now common concept of playing to gain the favor of a subjective judge. There are a lot of politics at play in this game, as people will try and gain revenge when you snub their card.

I just hate these games, I am often confused at what people will pick and find that just playing stupid things together will get everyone's votes.  I might as well play cards from my hand randomly.

I do have to give this game some benefit of the doubt, however, being one of the earliest games of this type which at least makes it innovative.

RATING: 6.5
Not a bad party game by any stretch of the imagination.  It's an easy game for anyone to grasp the concept of and just dive in.  It encourages lateral thinking with often amusing and funny results.  It has a limited lifespan so its not something to be played on a regular basis, but on rare occasions with non-gamers it can be alot of fun.  It does end up requiring expansion purchases to prevent it losing it's amusement factor after a few plays though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
If you have the right crowd, and you use the limited card mechanic, this can be a fun game. 

Otherwise, it's not too challenging and most non-gamers feel comfortable with the uncompetitive atmosphere and easy rules. It also scales well with many ages.

Too often you're stuck with nothing that really works, and you just toss your least useful card just to get rid of it. Removing all the cards that name people (the mostly likely to be useless) improves the game somewhat.

The great thing about this is it can take as little or as much time as required, and it can accomodate as many or as few players as one may have present in a group.

This party game is certainly very accessible, and it does lead to some pretty funny situations.  However, the laughter sort of dies down fairly quickly as you go.  Also, you just burn through cards as you play, and the second time they come up, they are completely unfunny.

I liked Apples to Apples when I first got it -- probably would have given it an "8" in those early days.  After several playings, though, it seemed to lose its luster for me.  I still don't mind playing it once in awhile, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list.  And I've played it with a few people who absolutely hate the "judging" method of scoring (they think it's too arbitrary).  Also, the "lobbying" rule is lame -- we never use it and keep the card's owners secret until the judge chooses one.

RATING: 6
Very light party game supports 6  players very well. Lots of laughs possible. With the penalty of your card being eliminated if you are the last to play a card, the game plays very quickly and does not outstay its welcome.

Can get repetitive. There are a few different ways to play but I always found it more fun when you don't know who played what cards and you continue to draw new cards. Once played where everyone goes through every card in their hand and explains their choices and that was long and boring and not at all fun.

Extremely lightweight, but hilarious party game.  Players try to match their noun cards to adjective cards drawn from a deck.  One player is the judge to determine which noun is the best match without knowing who played which noun.  The next player is the next judge on the next round.  Hilarity ensues.
Perhaps superceded by Cards Against Humanity.

RATING: 6
Rules need tweaking. Example: In the rules it says, only the first four players to play a card are taken into consideration, whereas the slower ones will have to take their cards back on the hand. On the other hand, the rules state, one should take into consideration the referees' preferences and thereby decide upon which card to play. That is a contradiction. We played once (first) according to the rules and, after that, one game saying that the referee would count to 3 loud, and every card played until then would be taken into consideration for a win. In the first game, players just banged their cards on the table randomly, resulting in proposals/descriptions which did not fit nor were funny in any way just so their card would be one of the four. The second game with tweaked rules was by far better. With common rules, this is a waste of time (3) to me, the other was a fine, sometimes hilarious party-game I'd rate a 7.5. When playing again I will always used tweaked rules, unless I am being forced to game with regular rules (for instance with another group)

Easy and often fun, which is pretty clutch for a party game.  Playing this with my grandmother and seeing her choose "James Dean" over "Frank Sinatra" for the card "Sexy" remains a highlight of my gaming career.
Downgraded my rating because the fun is somewhat group-specific, and it's easy to spend several turns with really boring cards in your hand.  I will usually play this, but there's other games I'd rather play in most situations.  A good group for this game is probably also a group that would be better suited for Cards Against Humanity.

EDIT: In comparison to other party games, this hasn't held up for me.  Generally speaking I'll try to suggest something else.

Since getting this game, I have created over 1000 of my own cards, including a few new variants for the Green Cards:
-One has two green apples facing each other.  This is called "Least or Most".  When this comes up, the Judge decided whether they are going to choose the Least "whatever the word is" or the Most- but not until after all players have chosen their Red cards and played them.  Without looking at them, the Judge decides on Least or Most.
-The second one has a pair of Green apples, and calls for a second flip, adding the two words together.  So, these cards looks like:  "INTERESTING and..."  Two green cards are up for that round, and players must find something that is described by them both.
-The third has three small red apples underneath the Green one.  This just lets the whoever wins the green card draw a whole new hand of red cards.  I made these because I wanted people to be able to see more of the Red deck in each game (there's a lot of cards in it), as well as be able to get rid of cards they don't like anymore.
...  Additionally, I created an expansion with Yellow Apple Cards.  These are shuffled into the Green deck.  Yellow apples are global parameters for that round... like "Whoever wins the green card is the next Judge", or "Players must play People cards this round, if they have one", or "Played cards are not discarded, but rather redealt to the players randomly.

I don't like Apples to Apples. I know I'm in the minority there. I find it kind of stifling - you're limited in your responses to the words on the cards you're dealt, and you don't always have a great option to play. Even if you have a card that can be twisted to fit the category, in my experience it's not likely to get picked by the judge. It's not unbearable if it doesn't go on for too long, but I'd rather play Say Anything.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Macinda.

Why we culled it: Apples to Apples is a pretty brilliant party game, and one of the few powers in the 'verse that can handle our moms after a few glasses of wine. That said, it does chew out its flavor fairly quickly within established groups, and we found that it almost never came out of our closet. Most of the people with whom we would play already own a copy, so ours proved largely redundant. So off to a better home with it!

I got one good play out of this before I was introduced to Cards Against Humanity. Tried going back to this one, and... I just can't. It's like trying to watch Barney the dinosaur after seeing Jurassic Park on the big screen. It just doesn't hold up for me now.

FYI - This is not a game.  It is a system to, as Monty Pyhton once put, "to buy a conversation."

If you want to play a game, play a game.  If you want a conversation, have one.  Apples to Apples is abysmal.

To me, Apples to Apples is the best light party game to come out in the last 10-20 years.

The base concept is solid and entertaining, as I like relating ideas and concepts together in interesting ways. Was a smash hit at family gatherings and new players can learn and play well after about 5-10 minutes. Everyone I've played with seems to love it.

While the basic idea of the game, taken seriously, is entertaining, it becomes way more fun once it goes abstract. When people start becoming more and more liberal with their associations and their suggestions, veering from very clever and subtle political jokes, to witty combinations tailored to the specific audience or evoking the players own personality. Humor is usually quick to get injected, sometimes sly, sometimes blatant and overt. Depending on who's playing, you might be better of taking it to a smart and sophisticated place, or allowing yourself to get completely irreverent. 

For me this is one piece of what makes a great party game: it creates a sort medium through which the player interaction and meta conversations themselves become the highlight of the evening. That is what I like so much about Scategories. You get those conversations and debates/arguments of "how someone play THAT card" or surprise around the table to find out it was your conservative aunt that make the thinly veiled sexual innuendo.

But the game is at its best for me when you get one or more players who have the right kind of mind. You know the ones--the ones who can take anything and turn it into a sexual innuendo or a dirty joke. The ones who like to push limits and bend rule and that think the best way of finding "the line" is to have not only crossed it, but jumped way, way over it. The freaks that manage to say and do things that have the "norms" of the bunch shaking their heads in disbelief and feeling mildly uncomfortable at "how wrong that was", but still laughing all the same. Like a good comic. You can guess which type I am. With the right group, this games starts becoming a competition to see who can come up with the weirdest or most fucked up shit. Love it.

So, since Cards Against Humanity is basically the same exact game only with a personality meant to take that last bit there to its logical and most extreme conclusion, is this game still worth owning if you are a sick and twisted soul? For me, yes. Clearly, based on my relative ratings, I prefer Cards Against Humanity, but there are just some groups or individuals too up tight to play a game with cards like "jerking off into a pool of children's tears". One may likewise find it more or less hilarious having to explain to their grandmother what a "dirty sanchez" is. And so, for those times, I keep Apples to Apples around, because its more socially flexible and fits into situations where CAH wouldn't.

So, consider this the PG13 and consider CAH as NR17.

I enjoy "playing" this game, and it is undoubtedly a good party game.  However I am really terrible at these sorts of games: where you try and choose what someone else will choose.

Great for a quick party game, but I find it does get old pretty quick.  What's annoying is that most players I've tried this with tend to immediately make known their red apple card by talking it up, or just downright admitting it.  This sometimes leads to the judge either playing favorites, or simply not choosing the strongest player.

Best simplest party game I know. Nouns & adgjectives and a judge's subjective opinion.  Playable by everyone.  Doesn't make people feel stupid.  It's subjective so you can influence the judge (as they rotate from player to player), but you also must predict whether a judge's personality will determine your winning card.

The "game" is one of predicting the other players mental connections while being constrained by a random selection of cards.  In theory, this might work, but you would really have to know the other people well.  If you don't the other players well, they might as well be random.  I think we are all supposed to laugh at the various connections.  In practice, the "game" is seemingly random and it's boring.

This is the game that is responsible for just about every shitty party game that I secretly judge new gamers for bringing to game night.  It basically boils down to you looking at your hand of cards, picking the weirdest one, and saying: "oh look I played Michael Jackson on "sexy"...isn't that funny!!"  There is precious little game or choice here, Dixit does the same general concept SO much better.

Many already know of Apples to Apples and its simple, fun, and talkative form of play.  Arguably the best non-gamer intro game around, it is very easy to pick up and play.  I read a comment that this game is a great way to get to know people, and it is true... the subjective nature of the answers is terrific for breaking the ice.  It is also a great game for kids, as it teaches them association, group play, and the words.

[Rated 2005/04/18 based on 5 plays]

Good fun with the right crowd - if people are prepared to argue their corner, it's entertaining.  If it's just "pick the best option" in something close to silence, it's pretty tedious.

Seems quite good for getting kids involved in what's a relatively grown-up game.

RATING: 6
A game so funny I cried...the first few times. After you get certain funny situations, though, the absurd stops being funny. There is only so many times "wheat" can be funny before you just feel like blah.

When this happens, people start throwing down cards too fast, just taking their chances with random funniness. Or you can decide to take your time and not punish slow play by not removing the last card play, but then it really drags.

A great game for a family or youth group that hasn't played many games. Replayability (even with expansions, which just continue the same laughs with new words) is low.

This is the best game to play with kids and non-gamers. This isn't a great game in the classic sense of a "game", but it is fun. And that is the most important criteria to me.

The first game was great fun, lots of laughter, lots of banter. The second game was a lot flatter. The laughter dried up a bit and the game felt dull.

It still works fairly well for new gamers though.

Bad:
-Other games that do it better
-Not recommended for a group older than 18
-Playing with more than 8 people

Overall:
A great game that is aging quickly.  Not because of a flaw in Apples to Apples but because so many games are stealing it's winning formula and improving upon it.  If you're looking for an interactive selection game play Say Anything or Dixit.  If your only goal in Apples to Apples is to make Helen Keller or Adolf Hitler jokes, play Cards Against Humanity.

For the most part, party games aren't meant to be published: why play Werewolf when you can play Mafia; why play Scattergories when you can come up with the categories yourself and have yourself better replayability for infinitely less money?

Apples to Apples is probably the one trademarked party game I've played in which the game components are in fact essential- it's not just a matter of matching any old adjective to the noun, you have to work within the artificial constraint of your hand.

No strategy, feels completely random. Not creative at all because of the restriction of only being able to use the words on the cards.

Edit: Played recently because a group of my friends were playing. It was actually fun, but I can't see myself ever suggesting it.

Apples to Apples is what it is - a great party game that plays very quickly and is accessible to a lot of people.  If you've got a large mixed group and want something that's quickly playable to provide some laughs, this is pretty much the best game you can get.

Don't expect depth - it's mostly purely a game of speed mixed in with some reading of people and some persuasiveness.  

It's light, incredibly simple to teach, and can make people really laugh and socialize.  If that's what you're looking for, A2A is probably the perfect choice.

There are certainly better games out there, but in a group, this ne always gets laughs. 

It's tame enough for my conservative parents to play and enough fun for my nieces. So foR holidays, and other gatherings, this one always makes it to the table. 

As a bonus, it's one my hearing impaired father can play with the rest of us.

Kids love this game.  I've seen a group of kids playing Apples to Apples for three hours without a break.

But, hey, at least they're occupied and not trying to kill each other

I don't understand the supposed popularity of this game.  It's okay.  But more often than not, you end up with red apple cards that make no sense whatsoever with the green apple cards -- not even in the "funny haha" or "funny weird" way either.  Hrm.

RATING: 5
A simple party game which is easily relatable and keeps a table of people laughing and chatting for an hour or two, but gameplay becomes very repetitive after repeat sessions. It suffers from a problem common to party games: the scoring can feel particularly arbitrary or meaningless, so not a great pick for competitive gamers.

RATING: 6.5
A good party game...the crowd really makes the game.  It's better with people that you know, but can shed some insight at a ice-breaker-type game too.  The only thing I don't like about this game is lobbying for your card to get picked.  Too many times cards seem to get picked because of a guilt-trip. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Pros: quick & easy, accessible to anyone, party game for larger groups

Cons: not a strategy game, low replayability

Honestly, this game gets a lot more flack than is necessary. Sure, it's been overplayed one million percent, but that does not make it innately bad. A solid party game, and hilarious with just the right group of friends! Certainly a flop at other times. Alcohol and a slap-happy, late-night tiredness helps.

Although I can think of hundreds of games I'd rather play, when it comes to playing with family around the holidays, this one usually comes out and isn't awful.  By far, not something I would ever request, but in comparison to Scene It or Trivial Pursuit, this one is much less painful.

This is a nice way to pass some time with non-gamers-- once a year or so... but as others have said, it doesn't really feel like a "game." It feels more like a nice, light social activity. If someone pulls it out (family reuinion? Filler at the end of brain burning night?) I'll play and won't be miserable. But I am fairly sure that 5 to 10 plays from now, when the novelty of pigs being brilliant and John F. Kennedy being flirtatious wears off, I'll loathe it. So I generally try to avoid it.

Lowered this from a "4" to a "3". It's not the worst game I've ever played. It's not even long enough to be tedious, but it's not fun at all. It's rarely funny, and most of the cards are boring and lead to boring gameplay. After playing a game like Cards Against Humanity, I know there's no reason for the generic and boring cards this game contains.

The biggest offense of this game is making parties boring. It sucks people away from lively conversation into a slow, laughterless game that seems to drain the energy from everyone involved.

Loathsome game.  Too long, too boring, and even good groups only make this an okay game.  People's choices are very difficult to predict, to the point where the game feels random.  Better if you're not keeping score, but still rather stupid.  It is intensely frustrating when you have what you think is a perfect match, and the other person picks something off-the-wall.  It disappoints me that this game is so popular, because I'll play nearly any party game before I touch this one.  If you're truly in love with this mechanic, play [gameid=50381] instead.

I enjoyed this many years ago, and it is an okay game for playing with semi-friends (people you know well enough to be yourself without being judged, but not well enough that you know a lot about them).  Prefer the cleaner theme to the raunchiness of Cards Against Humanity, but I outgrew this game long ago.  In the right circumstances, this rating would be higher (maybe a 4.5 or maybe even a 5).

This is a step above other party games, but I can see it having a few flaws.  Depending on the sorts of people you play with, the leader will find it gets harder to justify his or her cards, and other players will gang up on you.  Still, it's better than some of those crappy DVD trivia games, and most families will play it.

Quality of this really depends on the group. It's more fun as a social game where people argue for ridiculous cards. In this situation, it's better than CaH because the cards are less in your face, so the people you play with need to be funny and clever on their own rather than have a dead baby card be funny for them. 

Probably a 3 level game if played with a group that just quietly plays cards.

Apples to Apples consists only of two decks of cards: Things and Descriptions. Each turn, the current referee selects a Description and players try to pick, from the cards in their hands, the Things that best match that Description. The referee then chooses the Thing that appeals most and awards the card to the player who played it. The unusual combinations of Things and Descriptions are humorous to the extreme, and will quickly have the entire room in an uproar. Once a player has won a pre-determined number of cards, that player wins.

"Helen Keller" for literally any card in the deck, because she liked Helen Keller

This is just a time-waster. I've logged probably 50+ plays of this game. As a social game, it does what it sets out to do, most of the time.  If I was rating it on it's merits as a social game, I would give it a 7 or so; but this is a subjective rating of my likelihood to want to play, so here it is.

Notes:
- You SHOULD cheat at this game.  Play green cards into the pile; have 30+ cards in your hand, etc..  Makes it bearable.
- You SHOULD play this game for laughs ("Girl Scouts" for "Easy"; "Helen Keller" for "Insipid"... you get the idea)
- You SHOULD instead just play/teach Werewolf, Signs, or some other fun social game that actually requires thinking.

This is about the only game that my mother-in-law and I agree on. She said, "I could pick a card at random from my hand each time and do just as well." I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, but I do find this to be more frustrating than fun, even as a party game with casual gamers. I generally prefer open-ended party games, so I guess it shouldn't have surprised me that I didn't like this one.

Dropped to a 3 because Cards Against Humanity proved that you can make a game like this at least somewhat mechanically interesting without significant changes.

Easy to learn and play. A good mix of personalities among players make the game more interesting. The more you play with the same people though, the more predictable it gets, so it's not one for repeat plays over a short period of time.

A good party game to get people interacting in ways they probably didn't expect, but other games are better suited for the job, such as the more creative [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/9644/dixit]Dixit series[/url], the more open-ended and interactive [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/2164/north-star-games-llc]North Star Games party games[/url], or the absolutely shameless [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/50381/cards-against-humanity]Cards Against Humanity[/url]. Compared with those other "reacting to the judge" party games, this is pretty bland.

Strangely compelling. The arbitrary nature of judgment is annoying, though. Perhaps "No judge. Everyone gets one vote each turn (use distinct pawns). No one votes on their own." would work nicely.... (UPDATE a few years later: and behold, here comes Dixit, which is superior is nearly every way).

RATING: 5
The beauty of this game is the plain simplicity of it, and that anyone can play it. And for that reason, it will always be a part of my collection. 
An adjective is played, and everyone plays a noun to match it... That's it.
And because "that's it", I can get anyone to play it: my mom, my relatives, a clever bird. Anyone! 
So in my opinion, it's doing something right for that reason alone. 
It becomes tiring if you play it alot though, which is why I discourage it when I can. But when I know this is what needed to get the group going, this is perfect.

It's a fun party game which can be as short or as long as you want. The type of game is largely dependent on who you play with and how they choose cards. I think they game is the most fun when not taken to seriously. One player plays a category card and everyone else plays a card they feel applies to the category then the category player selects the card the feel best applies. The game then ends when one player has won a predetermined number of categories.

It gets knocked for being simple, but it's the only game I have that can accommodate any number of people, dropping in and out at random, with a completely arbitrary time limit.  This is the one you play in casual settings, or when waiting for players to show up for other games.

Very good game which bridges the gap between non-gamers and gamers.  It's a good party game for the former.

It's extremely simple, but thought-provoking, and more importantly it is bound to create a lot of conversation and interaction between all the gamers.  That is always a great thing for a game to do.

Party Crate Edition
Apples to Apples is a fast fun party game. Each turn, the current referee selects a Description and players try to pick, from the cards in their hands, the Things that best match that Description. The referee then chooses the Thing that appeals the most.  Once a player has won a pre-determined number of cards, that player wins.

This is the original put a word/theme out, everyone plays a card, and then one person decides the winner game. To me it's not exciting in the least.

Played it a fair amount in college, glad that the hype over this game among my friends has gone away and it can remain as being played only in the past and never to be seen again in the future.

Played once (with 7 players). A decent party game, which may lack some rhythm to remain interesting for a whole game. The choices are limited by the cards in hand, like in Attribute, but sometimes a card is an obvious play, and, unlike Attribute, there can be only one winner to the round, which may make the luck of the draw more important. Probably not a game I would choose, even in its category, but definitely not an unpleasant activity either.

RATING: 7
Good party game that is perfect for large family gatherings, especially the kind that contain large numbers of anti-gamers*.

My relatively high rating of 7 for this is because of how much enjoyment I've found in this game over the years, even though I'm mostly burned out on it now**.   If someone at a family gathering or some other gathering of non-gamers really wants to play it I will never be a game snob*** about it and refuse, but it's highly doubtful that I'd ever be the one to suggest it anymore unless there were no other options.


[i]*The kind of people that will go completely out of their way to avoid any games that take longer than 10 seconds to explain or that appear to require even the slightest bit of actual thought to play - after all, it's FAR more fun to stare blankly at a television for hours on end.[/i]

[i]**I don't agree with the idea of dropping the rating of a game I've enjoyed countless times over simply because I've played it far too often and have lost interest in it.  A game doesn't magically become garbage all of a sudden after several dozen plays.   If it was good enough to make me want to play it that often there was obviously something good about it and the rating should reflect that.[/i]

[i]***That's right, we're going to play Apples to Apples now...  or Settlers... or Carcassonne, or whatever other good game you hate just because it's popular.  Quit whining and get over yourself.[/i]

I'm sick of this game because it became the default party game in our couples group and extended family gatherings. Yes, it's a great game for all. But matching random words barely strains the brain. Rating lowered.

Clever stuff that appeals to non-gamers.  Good for parties or when the group is looking for something lighter.

We first played this with a group of about 10 theater friends and we had such a good time we played through the whole stack of cards (we did not even tally a winner at the end of the night).  A great party game and way to get to know people and have discussions.  Its always interesting to go from non-stop laughs one hand to deep though the next!

This is a fun game that has a will always appear at any family gathering with my kinsman. This is a fun light game that is best when played with family and other ones you are close to. This will evoke inside jokes and bitter hatred of some of the cards. This should be in every family's game collection and played at cocktail party after cocktail party.

Many people have commented that this isn't really a game.  OK, I see your point.  But whatever you want to call it, I *always* have fun playing this.  So, to each their own. Ratings update: down to a 6 from an 8.  My wife and I are beginning to really tire of this game.  Not nearly as fun as it used to be.

2nd update: Downgraded to a 4.  Say Anything is more fun than A to A and would be the preferred choice in this genre.

A great party game, ands a great game to play with mixed ages (kids and adults) and/or with non-game playing people.

I would always recommend you play this for no longer than 30 minutes.  While the game is very, very fun in the short term, it becomes repetative in the long term.

Great for large groups ready for a light hearted game. The combinations can get out of hand and really are best with alcohol. 
Not to be played often, but good fun for the right occations

A great time killer at conventions when you don't know any of the players.  People can join in and drop out as easily as breathing air.  Not a 'real' challenge, but can be lots of fun.  Can also be totally lame if the group doesn't get into the theme of the game.

Does this even qualify as a game?  The instructions might as well read "Draw cards.  Randomly pick a winner.  Repeat ad nauseum."

This game clearly feels like it's intended to be a party game (which is perfectly fine).  Despite this, the player interaction is nearly nonexistent.  The game doesn't really require people to converse, argue or interact at all.  A judge plays a descriptor, and each other player plays some type of noun (many are people or events) which they think will appeal to the judge in the context of the descriptor.  The judge then chooses the favored card, by whatever strikes her/his fancy.  Some of the potential card combinations provide some chuckles, but nothing really struck me as hilarious.  As the supposedly 30-minute game drags out to two hours, it loses people's attention to the point that referees don't even read the cards aloud; the game just becomes something for your hands and eyes to do while you gab.  Even played with the zaniest, most fun people, the game runs way too long to be fun the whole way through.  (A six-player game could last 51 rounds.)

It's not a bad party game. The "game" part, however, is not that interesting. The only skill that is involved is social acuity and understanding what word the dealer is going to like best. This really isn't a problem for a casual party game, but it does mean that I'm not a huge fan of Apples to Apples.

Great fun... once. With four people, we played through the entire base set in one session. Second time around wasn't nearly as good. You need an endless set of cards to keep this worthwhile.

A solid 9 as a "party game."  Only a 6 when compared to the rest of the games on this list.  Note: playing this game with the same group of gamers detracts from its overall "playability."  It becomes to obvious how to cater to the judge in question.

A fun word-matching game. It's good for non-gamers and there's an interesting element of personality-reading to it. It's very much a non-gamer's game. As a party game, it's much more fun than trivia games.

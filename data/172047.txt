Changed from a 7 to an 8. Very weird game: despite the theme, it's not really that thematic (certainly not after playing KDM and the like). It's disappointing that the embodiment of the Sin is just a stronger monster than the rest, without any special abilities. But it's also quite accessible, easy to explain and easy to play while still being strategic, and the modular style to plug the expansions works great to stop bloating issues like in other 1vsmany type of games. So I've ended up liking it but not for the expected reasons.

I like the basic flow of the game, the components, the theme, and the gameplay.   Basically, everything about the game is fine.

I don't like, however, how the game seems (and this is only after one play, mind, so maybe not every encounter is like this) to create an end-state of throwing 'missiles' at one another.  The Sins player, camped out in a fortified area with a lot of help.  The agents need to kill the last guy.  They send someone in, decked out as much as possible, who deals a chunk of damage, then inevitably dies to the counter-attack.  Repeat until the game is over.  That's a VERY dull way to end the game.

Although it seems I liked the game way more that the rest of my playgroup (even if I was the bad guy and I lost),i was so enthused by how close this game is in winning for either side (last dice roll kind of a thing).My first miniature game from CMON and from E.Lang and honestly I couldn't be happier. Afew rules here and there than can easily escape you on the first runthrough but you'll remember from the second scenario and on.Great choices, great minis..very cool.

I got this as a gift and do not support CMoNs practice of kickstarter exclusive game mechanics. Pay for looks, not to win.

Tactical dice chucking with push your luck. 

Locations give Heroes an opportunity to gear up and mitigate damage/corruption so...they can push their luck more! Many interesting choices for Sin/Overlord player to use take that cards and deployment of bad guys.

Great for when you're in the mood to throw dice but are sick of the slog in games like  zombicide. Quick and brutal for 5 players. Oh and amazing sculpts!

Cool 1vsALL game. My initial rating is an 8. This game shines in its sheer amount of variable adjustable settings and its tight mechanic.

I really like that it has no campaign system so that everybody can jump onto the Sins player seat in the evening to crush HAVEN. 

I am suprised that I like it. The other 1vsALL games felt all flat for me (IA, Descent 2 etc.).

The game is balanced with the addition of the expansions (houserules aren't needed).

The game is very tense, but fast.

Can't see why you'd ever play this more than 2 player, the additional hero players add nothing as all the information is on the table (nothing hidden, apart from your opponent's cards). It's ok I guess, I prefer this sort of game with a campaign to develop characters, or at least to have some sort of investment in the character. Here they're just tools to get to the victory, you full expect some to die on the way to that.

This probably makes it too puzzle solving for me, I don't mind puzzle solving/tactical games, but this just didn't grab me. Just thought, hmm, I'd much rather be playing Claustrophobia than this.

A game where I love the theme and a lot of the individual mechanics (oh, sweet, sweet corruption...), but love the overall game a lot less than I was expecting to, at least so far.  Hoping further play will resolve some of the fiddliness and reveal alternate strategies to the sin player just piling lots of baddies and fire/corruption tokens in chokehold locations.

[1 play] Some good ideas (corruption to boost actions of heroes but hurting them at the end) but the story is very light and the feeling is finally quite usual : move 2 spaces, target a monster, gather a pool of dice using equipment and abilities, roll these dice, count the hits vs the defenses, kill the monster or not, start again. Moreover, the heroes are very fragile (the goal of the sin player is to kill them all) and you can't develop them through the game : one heavy reaction and you are dead. And a little disappointed by the graphic approach of the minis and the sins, I understand that they wanted an horrific approach but all the avatars are somehow similar, big mountains of flesh and tentacles.

French edit : Ce jeu est une de mes grosses déceptions de l'année. Même si je ne suis guère un fan des gros jeux de figurines (demandant trop d'investissement en termes de temps, voir Conan), celui-ci partait sur une idée vraiment sympa : les sept péchés capitaux.

Or, le traitement qui en est fait est, comme toujours, glauque et très consensuel : on fait des bestioles informes et tentaculaires, très proches les unes des autres et donc les pouvoirs ne sont guère inspirés.

Au niveau de la mécanique, c'est du grand classique et, même si nous avions gagné la partie que j'ai faite, je ne garde aucun souvenir de ce qui s'est passé pendant celle-ci, ni coup d'éclat, ni coup de loose. Je ne sais même plus quel pêché nous avons repoussé... Pourtant, je me souviens parfaitement de ma première partie de Mice & Mystics ou de Conan.

Et c'est là que le jeu pêche par excès d'orgueil, par manque de gourmandise, simplement en bafouant cette envie du joueur qui, renonçant à l'avarice en quête d'un jeu luxueux, se retrouve avec un truc bien édité certes, mais trop paresseux. Point de colère donc, mais une déception certaine.

RATING: 6.9
This is a good game that has a few things going for it. The Corruption mechanic is the main draw, it allows you to time your pacing and explode with big turns and much drama. 

The mission system is also neat as it presents branching objective choices for players mid-mission. This is really clever and works extremely well.

Love the Lang exploding dice too.

Otherwise though it does seem like a souped up Zombicide. When it drags and gets repetitive is when it's at its weakest. It can definitely overstay its welcome at times by a half hour or so. 

Miniatures are great and the gameplay is solid with some really nice nobs to turn. Overall borderline on being something really special but probably just shy. It certainly didn't kick me in the teeth like Blood Rage.

Eric Lang's designs seem to share similar hallmarks: simple rules, not so simplistic gameplay. Lots of decisions to make. Lots of interaction. Very enjoyable game. Even though it's a "dudes on the map" game, it has enough differences (Corruption!) that it's not a "standard" type of game. So far, so good. :)

Why I back this game?  Comparing to Descent and war games for which you can dream about playing long campaigns that never actually happen. But this game can be setup and played in around 2 hours and feel complete. There are totally 7 sins with different scenarios that will be coming.  This is a game that will be easy to put out on table from time to time. 
The miniatures blew me away, the theme could generate a stunning atmosphere. The game play was great with smooth mechanics. Typical dice rolling Ameritrash but with a lots of fun.  I think it's game Eric should be proud of and become his trademark of his design.  I'm glad I own the KS copy and I think the game can get better with some new stories.  Apocalypse expansion figures are just catching my eyes but not necessary from the story development and game play.
7 sins...玩了七次7 sins, 此時也可對此game 作一小總結, 若在遊戲中經常被罪打跨，不要氣餒。當英雄真是不容易呢！7場戰役中英雄較為有把握的只有紅色情景。其他情景英雄要勝利可以但一定要精確計算、要犧牲、要寧願不打來耗sin player reaction, 要有裝備和運氣。本人玩七場中英雄險勝一場(last battle)而穩勝2場 (red)。
整體遊戲規則簡單, 易上手易上檯，玩完多次情景仍歷歷在目, 難得一見的好game.  各人技能算易理解也没有line of sight 和走格的煩惱。怪物死亡是1 與 0 的層面，怪獸沒有受傷可減省記傷麻煩。英雄受傷和腐败記帳容易。一目了然。自願腐敗系統配合主題一絕。雖你可批評此遊戲不太平衡。英雄難逃罪的魔劫。但又如何? 英雄是要有雖千萬人吾往矣之氣道、英雄也要有看淡人間生與死坦然面對槍林逼的勇氣。我給予此遊戲好評並在收藏不賣系列之一。
7 sins...加上Apocalypse expansion, Sins player 可以做 dominate a district 動用地圖炮傷所有一格內的英雄一血。FAITH team可要多一至二名成員的生命才可完成任務。FAITH team 要用血跑mission 避免非不必要的正面交鋒。

The core box is so packed with goodies and variety I sold off ALL of the expansions from my Kickstarter pledge.

The only way I can see the need for those expansions is that you've played the game a dozen times over a month, and as I play a variety of games, I'm happy with the awesome core set.

Lots of tokens to keep up with, and between that and the boatloads of dice things can feel a bit messy, but I LOVE the way the Sins player is handled, and the push your luck corruption mechanic is great. Seems to offer just enough choices through dice manipulation, card play, and corruption decisions to not feel like a totally random dice fest. Unfortunately has become a slog in most of our games and is ultimately unsatisfying to every player I've played it with. Sold after 4 games. Has good ideas mixed in with a game I don't care for with scenarios feeling very abstracted and dog pile strategies feeling like the only answer for the sins player at times.

A fast moving 1 vs all that plays well at all player counts. Streamlined but fun combat and interesting decisions that the heroes have to make.

Easy to learn, really nice miniatures, awesome monsters, the only thing i don't really like is that the controller controls nothing at all and that there is no specific need to kill it or play it other than it's strong and one sin card uses the fact that it is the 'controller'. I really enjoyed my games so far can't wait to play with more sins and the expansion.

This game is a fun 1 vs many game. It's not a campaign game but there are tonnes of combinations in the game so it will play out differently.

Lots of teams to put together along with sins makes for lots of different scenarios to be played.

Imo the best one vs all game of last year, more innovative than Conan (the overlord system is less fun perhaps) and more fully fleshed out with an okay rule book, vs conan's infuriatingly vague rule book, massive replayability out of the box - though the addition of the various sins doesn't add that much. I am yet to try the apocalypse Expansion. The game scales well from two to five. It's fun to play both sides. I think the game is balanced; I don't really think that Lang makes unbalanced games, I think that his games often take a few plays to grok the best way to play and the extent to which you respond to your opponents - Blood rage. 

I like this game so much I made a how to play video 

https://youtu.be/YGobkhuz8F0

In all fairness Doom is excellent also - though I think this one just has the edge. 

The theming could be better, I'd rather that this had had a Black Plaguesque theme instead of the faux Clive barker vibe that it has going, perhaps even with some cross over - I am dreaming there and just nitpicking. Recommended.

An interesting game because it doesn't do what you'd expect. It isn't a shoot-'em-up style game, more slow moving in ways. The way the Sins player interrupts the other side is brilliant and prevents the typical scripting  of turns in other all vs one games. I do wish there was a bit more to differentiate the sins from one another. The art is awesome though there is a disconnect between the art and the components as if two designers were at odds over the look of the game. Solid though I will admit there are some longevity concerns since there is variety but it is subtle. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not sure how I feel about the Others, so I'll consider this a provisional rating.  I don't find it complex, but I do feel that despite being a minis game, it is lacking in the tactical department.  I understand that Lang's design goal was to have the Others play fast and hard, and for a minis game, it succeeds in that department.  But is it fun?  I dunno.

First, I'd say if you dig Zombicide, you will probably dig the Others.  Like that game, I found the Others to be a little too "fuck it".  Allow me to explain.

I am not talking about Lang throwing everything into a blender and calling it a day, but rather that the choices that players - both the sin and the heroes - will make revolve around the philosophy of "fuck it".  There's no real grand strategy that you can play here nor is their room to exercise tactical prowess - instead, the focus is to get as much gear as you can and dive headlong into danger in order to bust through the objectives as fast as you can.  Failure to take that mindset means you will die.  What this means is that you will typically eschew interesting characters like Rose for beefy characters like Thorley; in other words, you'll find that despite the bevy of characters available in the box, if you want to win as the heroes, your choices are made for you and the "crappier", more interesting folks are sent to the reserves.

Now I must include a disclaimer here - this is based on two plays of the recommended scenario and perhaps the other ones are more engaging, but ultimately, as the sin player, I did not feel rewarded for winning the game.  Instead, I felt like it was an inevitability.  The rules allow the sin player to simply pile up on the heroes and throw a metric shitload of dice.  While the heroes won't die instantly (they are quite tough), it just feels like without some genius play and a lot of luck, the heroes are not going to have a good time.

At any rate, I haven't written this one off just yet as I respect Lang as a designer and know he's capable of some serious awesomesauce, but as of this writing, I haven't seen it yet in the Others.

Highly unbalanced - monster player can win using no tactics, he just have more dices and with some luck game ended in 20 mins. Attack monster, roll 4 success on 7 dice, monster lives. Monster counterattacks, he has luck with rolls, deals 10 damage on 8 dice, you are dead.

Luck based overpriced box full of minis. And 7 addons, also full of minis, adding very little to the game. Cool Minis, Bad Game.

Backed Lobotomy seems the better choice till now... 

Update: With the huge amount of minis, I'll give 'em a try! Backed! KS 265all.

So "March 2016" shipping is a farce now..., in September with ships from bankrupt company Hanjin will "never" arrive... 
The bankruptcy is not the fault of CMON but the massive delay before shipping is the reason the games are on these ships... So CMON is responsible!
Like The last Zombicide Black Plague which everybody got earlier in retail than their backers...
It seems it will happen again!
If yes, this was my last CMON KS and last CMON sale!

So come on CMOn and do something to regret and give some hugh compensation to your loyal backers!
This was my 8th CMON KS and the outcome will decide if this was my last...

update Nov. 02nd 2016 - received my pledge finaly, 9 months late!
(Everything including Corruption and Wounds Packs and the Apocalypse Extras.)

This is a challenging game to learn and teach. A lot of mechanics and system rules to keep up with.  You need a solid group of gamers to play/learn this before trying to introduce casuals. With that said, it is surprisingly well balanced and fun. Creates opportunities for epic retelling of game play

Nehéz két játék után még ítéletet mondanom. Az biztos, hogy első ránézésre kifejezetten taszítottak a minik, és a hanglat se fogott. Emiatt kihagytam a KS-t, amit utólag kicsit bánok, mivel a két játék után nagyon tetszik a játék. Ennyire eurós ám mégis hangulatos DM-es játékot még nem játszottam. Komoly döntések mindkét oldalon, még akkor is ha sok a kockadobálás. Hangulatos elemek, nagyszerűek a scenariok is. Érdekes módon hangulatosabbnak érzem ezeket a jól összerakott egyszeri forgatókönyveket, mint a kampány módokat általában. Ja, és rengeteg variáció van a retail dobozban, átlagos gémernek végtelen. 20-30 játékot simán bele lehet tenni ismétlés nélkül. Szóval nem a zombicide vonalas "ratail dobozban két-három játék 30kért" típus. Változhat még az értékelés, de két játék után nem merek többet adni, mert a siker kulcsa változatosság lesz.

Tried it with my gaming group this weekend. Good balance of pick up and play and hardcore gamers. The pickupnplay folks thought there were way too many rules, and even the hardcore gamers thought that we were missing some rules to make the gameplay more balanced. There was a lot of rifling through the rule book, which is not our groups idea of enjoyment. We will give it one more try and have the Sin player focus a lot more ahead of time on game mechanics and rules. However I don't know when that will be, this might just slide right off our gaming list. Hopefully play it again within the next year.

Only 1 play, which isn't enough to form a strong opinion. I'm so-so on these types of hybrid euro-thematic games as I generally prefer strategy titles. That caveat aside, Cool Mini does a great job with the miniatures, and most of the production is quite good. Cards and a few other aspects are meh. The game system isn't all that complicated, although I expect there will be a few clarifications/errata given the number of moving pieces. Overall, I thought it was an ok game experience. Most of the decision making is whether to use limited actions or costly bonuses to try and achieve, or improve your chances of achieving, an objective. That aspect is well done. That said, dice and cards rule the game, and you'd have to get into the thematic aspect to really appreciate the experience, or not mind a lot of chaos from dice results. Assuming you enjoy that sort of game, it appears to have good replay and a nice game system.

This just wasn't my thing. The corruption mechanic is an interesting one as it gives the hero player the option to 'hurt' themselves in order to give themselves a one-time bonus. Overall it just felt a little bloated and the game we played felt like it was over right from near the beginning due to some fortunate/unfortunate dice rolls.

I've now played Gluttony and Envy and enjoyed both games. It reminds me a lot of Zombicide (which I also like) but that also makes me feel a bit jaded towards CoolMiniOrNot's products. You can see this as a positive or a negative, but it almost feels like they have a certain basic rule set that things just expand off of. Flying Frog is another company that does this same type of thing.

In any case, this is an enjoyable game, but probably very expensive for collectors as you really don't have the whole game without all seven sins, now do you? There is massive variety though as any of these sins can be used with any of the scenarios and each one plays very differently. It seems like the kind of game that could be played weekly with the same group with good results. 

There are tough choices on most turns, it is thrilling to take down a nasty monster, and I like that it is adversarial (there is an overlord) instead of a pure co-op. A solid effort, and one I'd always be happy to play, but that I personally feel would be redundant and not worth the money for my own collection.

The strategy and tactics can be not so obvious the first few plays but the thought for each move and action is simple yet difficult.

Take control of the FAITH agents or one of the seven deadly sins and duke it out. The sins player is playing as a reactionary player which makes for an interesting dynamic with how actions work.

There's an enrage timer mechanic built into the game where if the FAITH players take too long the sin player just gets stronger and stronger. It's a good way to avoid trying to drag out the game and really gives that feeling that the sin is taking over.

The corruption mechanic is great and allows you to partake in some power if only for a brief moment. Really adds to the theme and picking when to take corruption well can really swing the game in your favor as the FAITH player.

I for one love the theme and think it has some clever game mechanics.

Can be a bit abstract with the monster spawning's and interrupt cards but still think it work really well (exploding dice are cool and work for both players) Corruption mechanic is nice to when heroes can take voluntary corruption to become stronger (get more dice/automatic hits etc)!

Better than Descent as the overlord player. Starting scenario seems really easy for the heroes though. That might change with more challenging stories.

We inevitably make a few mistakes with them during the game. 2) I don’t enjoy playing as the sin player that much. 3) It seems like it is too easy for the sin player to set up an unwinnable situation for the FAITH team. 4) I just plain enjoy Conan more. All of that being said though, its still fun.

A great take on the players vs DM style of gaming which I generally don't like, however this game fixes several issues I have with the genre. Firstly it balanced the game so neither the DM nor players have to pull their punches. Secondly it eliminates the DM's "turn" in favor of giving him reactions to the players actions. A great design, the greatest flaw of which is the number of expansions and cost requires one to spend as much as it would cost to make a 1500pts 40k army in order to have the complete game.

This just isn't my type of game which is the primary factor in my rating.  But even considering that, the theme is a convoluted fantasy that's a product of someone else's imagination and which just isn't engaging to me at all.  While the mini's are somewhat interesting, the rest of the artwork from the board tiles to the character art are just unappealing (but perhaps that's the intent given the theme).

This is Pandemic meets Arcadia Quest. This game will not be what you expect it to be. While it looks like a dungeon crawl-esque game, I assure you its absolutely not. You go around dealing with crisis/objectives, exactly like Pandemic, but with dice mechanics similar to Arcadia Quest.
It seems awfully fiddly for what it is, but its not that complex.

Nem volt rossz élmény, de nem az én világom ez a stílus. Az ilyen jellegű játékoknál azt érzem, hogy sokkal több a szabály, mint amennyi a játékmenet alapján indokolt lenne. Talán némileg a kockadobások mennyisége is túlzás. Persze ezt nehéz egy játék alapján megállapítani, de érzésre sok volt, sok múlott rajta. Az biztos, hogy egyedi megjelenése, hangulata van, de nekem nem lesz a kedvencem.

Yeah, it's one of those games where you chuck a bunch of dice (of which they don't include enough to actually take your turn - boo!). When they come up hits, you cheer. When they come up misses, you curse whoever invented dice in the first place. So, the usual reductive Ameritrash fuckery. Art is cool at least. Playing the heroes felt lousy, like you're always stepping in dog shit. My wife said playing Sin didn't feel great either, since they get far fewer turns than the forces of FAITH. Seems unbalanced as well - Sin monsters feel overpowered. Not recommended.

One versus all scenario-based game which reminds me of Descent 2.0.  The most interesting thing about it is the corruption mechanism in which you need to bump up your corruption to defeat the boss monster, which puts your character on the brink of ruin.  Nice minis and theming.

In The Others, the world stands on the brink of apocalypse, as the fanatics of the Hell Club have summoned the 7 Deadly Sins to lay waste to our reality. Slowly the Others have creeped into our lives, corrupting society from within. The city of Haven is the key to their invasion, but it will not go down without a fight, thanks to the actions of the paranormal organization known as F.A.I.T.H. (Federal Authority for the Interdiction of Transdimensional Horrors). Each session of The Others is played with one player controlling the forces of a single Sin, against the other players who control a team of 7 FAITH heroes. The heroes cooperate to survive the Sin's attacks and accomplish the missions set before them, while the Sin attempts to thwart the heroes in all ways (preferably by destroying them).

The heroes are divided into different classes, each specialized in a different aspect of the game. Leaders are good at helping the other members of the team. Bruisers are excellent melee fighters. Snipers are experts at using guns to put down monsters from a distance. And Fixers have the resourcefulness and knowledge of the occult necessary to resolve supernatural crises that spread through the city. Each hero also has their own stats and unique abilities that set them apart from all others. Knowing when to bring in the right reinforcement can be key to FAITH’s victory.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a simple and straightforward DM game which doesn't really have a campaign or leveling up. Everything is a one shot adventure. The theme isn't overly compelling or interesting for me which detracts from my interest although the minis are nice as is typical of CMON. I just find games requiring a DM challenging to get to the table as a whole as people with whom I game don't want to have 3/4 vs 1 as a rule.

I backed this on Kickstarter but didn't get it. CMON said I was at fault even though I filled in the survey in time and correctly and still get their spam email.

I haven't played enough to rate. But I think it's my favourite 1vsmany game.

This is going to be a solid 8 or 9. Problem is? None of my group ever really feel enthralled to play it.

The Others is not an easy game. It's quite tense and difficult to see an easy path to victory. Also, the amount of dice you throw in this game can make it feel really swingy. Yes this is a problem of buckets 'o' dice games, but considering the amount of tactical depth you have to apply, it feels especially crushing when a couple of lucky rolls 1-shots a full health hero.

Again, I REALLY like it, but I need to get more plays in before I can give a considered verdict.

Wonderful art (Adrian Smith) and about as quality plastic minis as you can get outside of Games Workshop.  This is a well designed game for two players: One is the Sin, one is the Faith team. Despite what it lists on the tin, this is a "superficial co-op" game since players on the Faith side have the exact same goal and all information is 100% open.   There's no need and it's in fact worse with more players on the Faith side as a single player will end up controlling every character's actions anyway (they just won't physically move the pieces or roll the dice).  What contributes to this, unlike games like Advanced Heroquest or any RPG, is that there is no carry over between games of The Others, all campaign games are 100% independent of each other.  if you loose your favorite character in the first game, you can use them in any other games.

I for one am glad that Mansions of Madness is now app-driven. Why? Because Eric Lang has made the definitive 1 vs Many game for me. The rules are simple. The game is fast. The options and variations are broad. 

It's easily one of the best dudes on a map game I've ever played.

This game is weighted to where the Sins player has an advantage.  I usually like to play the Sins player, so in order to not crush the players every game, I've house ruled that they get start with 1 or 2 pieces of gear per player, and I hold back.  Much more fun that way.

From how this campaign ran, surpassing all of CMON's non-Zombicide games to earn a place among the top 10 money making KS campaigns, it made me curious.
 As I saw the campaign evolve as it unleashed mini to mini, I was amazed.
 Then the Apocalypse box appeared and my mind was blown. Between the Sins and Team Apocalypse, I've never seen such intricately detailed minis before.
  I missed backing ZBP, but late-pledged it.
 I'm sure in the hell glad I backed this one up. It should deserve a 9 or 10, though it wasn't selected as a KS staff pick compared to Lobotomy, which I also backed (my first KSF). But CMON always delivers.

I ran the sins and four friends ran the heroes. By viewing two videos and reading most of the rules we adopted the learn-as-you-play. In 3 hours we had a blast. Several want to play again. What was fun is that the heroes are collaborating and involved even when it is not their turn. Best of all is when the I was able to say "but wait..." then play a sin card. So much fun!

Seems like it has potential, although it does reek slightly of a cash-grab due the absurd amount of expansions attached to it, all of which seem essential to increase the longevity of the game.

Other than that, mechanically it's a bit like Descent meets The Ghostbusters Board Game set in a Clive Barker-esque world that resembles a super-grim Hellboy. Playing as The Sin is pretty fun, I will say, which is nice because one player has to be the bad guy, and depending on the person that can be a bummer in some other games that require that to be the case.

Complex Asymmetrical game. Harder to play than Claustrophobia but better in the long run. Lots of variations with just the base heroes/sins and scenarios alone. Probably will get kicked down once Moloch arises in Her Majesty's Service.

RATING: 8
A fairly simple game mechanics-wise... though the weight of the rulebook would have you think otherwise. While choices seem limited, they are all critical, and that provides for nice thinking and pressure to do the best thing. The Sins player seems to have plenty of options at his disposal.

I like:
- The minis are great
- Good choices to be made
- Simultaneous combat!! (attacking or being attacked, you are still possibly damaging things!)
- Lots of set up choices to make for variance

Can't wait to play with the other Sins and options!

Just still not sure why they didn't print the map tiles double-sided for more terrain...

this is a seriously good game! Besides the fact that it all looks gorgeous; very cool miniatures of outstanding quality and generally speaking a game which is soaked in theme (games can't be dark enough to my taste, btw), it's also really clever and well-balanced. This may be dice-oriented, but it can be a real brain-burner too. I just don't get all the negative criticism it has received since it was released. One happy player here, looking forward to my next play.

Kickstarter.  Received 9/10/16.

We wanted to like it.  And to some extent, we really do love it.  But it takes way too long for what it is.  Our first play was around 3 hours.  We though the second would go faster, but even that clocked in at around 2.5 hours.  I played as sin both times, but I can tell my girlfriend was often frustrated at how quickly the sin was able to bounce back.  We had fun both games, but I can see how much of the game is simply lost at only 2 players.  Part of the fun of sin is tempting the FAITH player(s) to take more corruption and to play for themselves rather than the team.  That dynamic and really all of the table talk would really make this a more interesting game, but we likely won't have the time or available gaming friends to support the massive amount of space it takes on the shelf.

Semi-cooperative (one against the rest). 

It's a fun game and I hope to play it again. It worked well for the collaborative side. But it looked like it was a bit unwieldy for the apocalypse side, lots of things to track , interrupt actions, special cards, types of monsters, etc. It looked like more work to handle than, say, the Empire side in Star Wars: Imperial Assault.

RATING: 9
A one vs all game with a really solid and original theme. Players take on the roll of a team of agents out to stop the personification of the seven deadly sins from taking over the world, it's a dark mash up of the movies Men in Black and R.I.P.D! Gameplay is simpler than an initial glance might suggest and all of the components are fantastic, but best of all the player playing solo doesn't have to pull any punches, in fact if they do they will probably lose.

Design by Eric Lang. He is one of my favorite designers. A horror story telling game that induce horror and fear in the hearts of the players.

But then there are the great minis by CMON. Therefore I am hooked!

One versus Many in a horror themed game. Sounds terrible to me, but this game is actually really good. If the player playing the Sin is good then it is very hard for the players to win. We lost our first 3 games, but then won our last 2 that I played (all with different groups). It definitely can suffer from the experienced player telling everyone else what to do, which is exactly what I did on my last play through to get the win.  I won't pick this one up because the theme excludes so many people, but still a great game worth buying for the target audience.

Fantastic artwork and theme, solid mechanics and excellent replayability. Rules take about an hour to get the basics of and a couple of games are likely needed before sins/heroes get the hang of things, but the game is an excellent grimdark addition to the overlord genre. The miniatures in particular are amongst if not the best in board gaming.

A little more lore and background information about the brooding, troubled heroes and the vile agents of sin would be appreciated, if only because the game's apocalyptic and demonic overtones feel underhashed in this regard. But you can fill in the blanks!

One of my favorite ameritrash games to come out in recent years. Super easy to teach, although the rule book is way too in-depth. The replayablity is super high, especially if you're lucky like me and have the KS edition. The component quality is top notch, but that is expected as it is a CMON game. Game time is longer than listed on the box. Games come in at about 2-2.5 hours. But all games seem to be very tight with the winner not clear until the last dice roll. This is why this is a great one vs many game. I love the thrill. Very excited to get this to the table more often and very happy its in my 2017 10x10 challenge.

This is dripping with theme ... dripping blood, but still dripping ... minis are incredible, components solid (bonus plastic are even better), backstory is good and allows for your own development and imagination ... so, gameplay?  Good, actually very good.  Easy to learn (which is not the norm for an asymmetrical game) and tight.  Several people say Sins have the advantage, but also hear claims that Faith wins as much (my first few games Faith won running) -- but isn't that some evidence of balance?  The more I play the more themes seem to emerge -- you have Hell Boy, Dresden Files (need to make my own heroes for this variant), Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven, Hellraiser, Sons of Anarchy, Se7en and just plain old fashion Good vs. Evil . . . to name a few . . .

Currently my favourite game.  I love the game and the minis.  Hate how long it takes to explain the game to a new player.  Once you play, the rules are fairly intuitive but it's not something you can just jump into.

I like that it's a 1 vs many game but that the 1 doesn't necessarily have a defined turn.  Being able to interrupt a turn or reacting to a previous move really keeps the players in suspense. I also enjoy that the many are facing what appear to be overwhelming odds, yet if they focus on their mission they still have a reasonable chance at winning the game.

This game has the more expansions than nearly any other boardgame I have seen. In addition, you can buy upgrades to components (go from cardboard to plastic) and additional dice. It is basically a microtransaction game, but the microtransactions cost $20 each. With that said, it is incredibly fun to play. In my first game, "Pride" came within one turn of winning - I look forward to playing again soon.

This was pretty meh. Looks like another game in the same vein as Zombicide, but ends up being kind of a crazy, cinematic, "everything is going to hell" kind of game. In that way, it's pretty unique. You can't take a step without running into a monster, some fire, a pentagram, or cultists. Everything is being destroyed, and the heroes are trying to fight against the Sin Player in a seemingly no-win situation. This is actually pretty accurate, since the Sin Player has a pretty big advantage over the heroes. All they have to do is lie in wait and spring traps on heroes when it's appropriate. I wasn't really sure what to expect with The Others, other than that it looked similar to Zombicide, but I ended up not enjoying it that much. It's difficult to do 1 vs Many games, and the balance in this one seemed a little off.

If you are familiar with Eric Lang's work, this theme and content will not surprise you. The game is put out by CoolMini or Not so you can expect some very fine miniatures.

In this game one person plays the evil overlord against all other players. Interestingly enough, the good characters have very awesome powers and seem to outbalance the overlord. But the overlord is constantly tricking them into using their powers by taking corruption. It's only a matter of time before the good characters become consumed by their own corruption.

The evil powers are the 7 deadly sins like Greed, Wrath, Gluttony, etc. In a given game the overlord chooses his sin of choice for the game and the good players choose their heroes. This is a sandbox type game like say Zombicide, where you set up the game board according to the missions provided or you can make your own setup and special objectives.

Upon playing our first game, the good players are constantly succeeding seemingly easily at every battle or search option. The overlord just gently messes with their plans, giving those heroes a false sense of security. But each round of play the heroes seem to be taking on a mess of corruption and soon perish.

So disappointed with the unprofessionalism of CMON regarding "The Others".
Despite this Kickstarter being incredibly late (not completely CMON's fault), we received not a single piece of correspondence from CMON regarding not filling out a pledge manager on their site (apparently filling this out on the actual Kickstarter page is just an "informational"). CMON were quite happy for my money to sit in their account indefinitely, making zero effort to contact us about why they were not sending anything out to us. 
On contacting them, nothing but disdain from their support personnel - the fault was mine for not reading all 63 updates on the Kickstarter page and noticing I hadn't received an email they didn't send me. They wanted extra money to mail a new copy of whatever they had in stock from the USA - at considerable cost and paying all import costs.
For such an "established" company, I find their attitude astounding and I will never deal with this sham of a company again.

03-11-2016. Rated after 1 play. The Others: 7 Sins is yet another new game from Eric M. Lang. So far, I have enjoyed many of his recent games. It seems to me that the Others: 7 Sins is the next one in a line of successes.

The theme of the Others: 7 Sins is dark. A group of people fights the corruption of a semi-biblical end-time inspired set of sins. The game resolves around players activating heroes in order to obtain specific scenario-based objectives. In response to hero activation, the overlord may activate his own troops to try to kill them. Fun twist here is that the Heroes can be corrupted by the sins, and grow in power sacrificing/harming themselves in order to do so.

SO far, I played several games wrong but the mechanisms and the gameplay appealed to me. I wonder if we can get the next game to be a more tense exercise.

I was really enamored with my one play of this one. If you have someone running the sin player who knows how to play the game, it's great fun. You constantly feel, as the heroes, that you're fighting an uphill battle, but that's such a cool feeling when you finally overpower the sin player by exploiting a mistake he makes. The game really has a good pace to it. I enjoyed it a lot.

After trying the game several times, I've found that it just doesn't click for me. I think my biggest issue is how the Sin player does their actions. The constant interruptions in the turn order started to get on my nerves very quickly. Makes it feel like it is impossible to coordinate with my allies when it comes to positioning. Want to stay together for a dice buff in combat? Well too bad cuz the Sin player will likely attack the lone player before the next one can move their character. I'm not sure I can get over my dislike of this part of the game, which is a big disappointment for me since I adore the theme.

Mmhm. Didn’t find this one very appealing. Maybe if the chrome of all the minis was stripped away I’d find it easier to look at this purely on its merits as a game. Felt stodgy and scripted to play, just didn’t engage me.

The game seems pretty difficult to win for the non-Sin players. I played as Pride and was always a bit upset when some of my monsters died, but that didn't really seem to set me back much. Being able to place tokens each round really helped secure my victory, especially because I was able to load up one space with Fire tokens and another with Corruption tokens. This was, admittedly, our first play of the game so I'd like to give it a few more to try and figure out if the game ever feels a bit more balanced.

just another one vs all had the kickstarter version and was very disappointed that every sin are exactly the same just there special power is slightly different there literally was no reason for the other sins and all the extra plastic because every big guy is a 7x7 on health and attack, every controller is a 5x5, every acolyte is a 2x2 and so on just there special ability is different which means there was no need for all sins they could of just allowed for different specail abilites to choose from for the baddies was a complete waste with all the sins and plastic.  Was a complete CMON plastic porn money grab.

Overlord vs heroes scenario-based dungeon-crawl type game.  Heavily luck-dependent, but includes a solid amount of tough decisions to make each round.

I really enjoyed my experience as the Sin player.  It is trashy as all get out, but so much fun.  And tons of fun to roll the amount of dice you are able to at any given point.  Feels great to roll 14 dice at once! haha.  Excited to try different stories and the heroes side.  Ratings obviously subject to change as game is tried more and more

RATING: 6
A lot of mixed feelings here.
The base mechanics are good. The game plays at a decent pace and isn't too complicated. Heroes have an interesting set of abilities, and a lot of tense choices. The action is exciting.
However, a lot of strengths of the Sin player feel "cheap". Heroes take damage just by walking around. The Sins get to teleport in monsters in a variety of ways. A lucky roll by the heroes probably doesn't make much difference, but a lucky roll by the Sins devastates the heroes.
I'm never a fan of 1 vs. all games, and this is no exception.
There are a few areas where balance feels off:
* Things seem much easier for the Sin player.
* Shooters seem very weak.
* Clumps of several monsters are really tough for the heroes to do anything about, and very easy for the Sin player to make.

Overall I like it, but I think I may want to make some houserules to deal with some of these issues.

Also, 7 different sin model sets seems like a complete waste; since you never use more than 1 set at a time anyway, and they aren't recognizable in any sense, there might as well just be one generic set.

The dark theme definitely comes through in spades - excellent miniatures and world building. This game is what I hoped Zombicide would be - dice rolling mixed with strategy and area control. Don't be fooled, there is plenty of depth in this gem.

First thought was 10/10, loved it. Still do but it seems impossible for the heroes to win. 11 plays in and they've only won once. Going to try and play with just the core game Sin and Heroes to see if that helps.

Have it all, it's the expected high quality from CMON, love zombicide and this is continuation of that system, though I could perhaps have wished for a slightly more complex system, - it's very easy to get into if one has tried Zombicide. - could have used that the game was perhaps a fully co-op, and not a co-op vs. game master.. but that's just personal preference.

Co-op Ameritrash dungeon crawl isn't something I would usually be drawn to, but this is one I enjoy quite a bit. The 'one vs all' is interesting, and maybe I have just had a good run with it, but I find that it generates a good amount of conversation amongst the co-operating players. I also look the clean mechanics, the corruption system, and the difficulty, particularly with an actual player behind the helm. A tense but fun and interactive experience.

I enjoy this game a lot.  The minis and theme were the big hook, but the game play is excellent.  The one quibble I have is with all the district boards (especially those from the expansions) all draw from the same five effects.  I was really hoping for additional effects in the expansions (and I'm making my own custom boards to add that in).

The game was fine. It's like an improved version of Zombicide, but one-vs-all. The biggest problem is that the luck of the dice can be significant. The sin player can sometimes roll a huge amount of dice, and then do several rerolls and extra rolls, getting an instant kill.

Play any boardgame, even if I try and be on the good side of people, it eventually devolves to "Anyone but he should win" against me. So I welcomed this game with open tentacles. I do not mind playing the lone sin against many cooperating hero players. You could say I enjoy them squirming in their seats trying to make decisions.

So from a sin player's point of view, this game is awesome. It takes long in my circle, last night's story took nearly 5 hours (4 heroes controlled by two figures), but I have had AP issues in my circle for every game. 

I love it, but another player from my group claims he would never be able to play the lone sin. So unless your group has that one person who is willing to, or even wants to play as the lone antagonist, you might want to reconsider it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Fun 1 vs Many game that wraps a Hellboy-ish theme up in a good little package. Suffers slightly from overproduction as each individual sin comes with it's own miniatures - could've easily been replaced by tokens or placeholder. That said, the miniatures are gorgeous and are packed with details.

Does better than other 1vMany games because the Sins player doesn't get his own turn but interrupts the turns of the actual players.

This game is beautiful.  I really enjoy this type of horror theme.  Love the artwork, the miniatures are excellent, and I don't think I have seen any other game with this level of detail put into every piece.  (Really, any of these abominations and avatars could rival Games Workshop's Chaos Daemons, and these came pre-assembled and of a sturdier, more flexible and weighty plastic).  On aesthetics alone, opening this box made me excited to play!

So far, I have played it with 5 as the Sins player, which was very fun, and with 2 as the FAITH player (team of 3 heroes), which was more of a strategic back and forth type play.  I would agree with the community in this game being best with 3 or 5 players, as 4 FAITH team members is ideal, and the table talk between the co-op team really changes the game play environment. 
 
First Impressions are that there are a lot of rules, but once you learn them all, they all make sense and are easy to remember.  I suspect game play will be much smoother when playing again with the same group.  I think the game itself is very exciting and strategic, and the rules themselves make the Sin player terrifying to the FAITH team and adds a lot of tension and anxiety as everyone carefully plans their strategies to complete their goals, while the Sins player does his best to exploit any mistakes or weaknesses in their plans!

I am excited to play again, and feel like every time we do it will be a unique experience.  With the core box alone, there are 28 different scenarios to play!  (7 Stories, with 2 Maps for each, and 2 different Sins to be used for each of them.)  Add the other 5 Sins from expansions, and that brings you to 98!  Not to mention the FAITH Team Expansions add more city tiles and new maps for each of the 7 Stories to go along with them, as well as giving you 6 different teams to choose from, and a total of 35 unique characters to build your own FAITH team.  There is also the big box expansion Apocalypse, which adds a new game mode, an 8th Story board and 6 maps to go with it.  That makes 8 Stories x 6 Maps each x 7 Sins = 336 unique scenarios to play through, with your choice of 7 from 35 unique characters.  I can't fathom playing though anywhere near that many games, so that puts the replay-ability of this game at virtually infinite!

I should also mention that I believe you could create a very intense campaign by following each of the 8 stories in order, using a different Sin for each, culminating in the Apocalypse!  FAITH could build a team from their pool of 35 characters, permanently removing from the campaign any characters who die in each story!

Very impressed with this game.  Would definitely recommend!

Definitely need and want to play more often.  Game is far more abstract feeling than I originally thought.  The map is sort of misleading as you think it's going to be a dungeon crawl, it's much more gamerly than that as you can jump around the map pretty easily.  You really do need to plan out your objectives and what everyone's goal is going to be each round, meanwhile the Sin player is constantly throwing wrenches in those plans.

Really neat and interesting... the dice rolls can be a bit frustrating.  I love exploding dice, and I love the randomness added to a light and fun game like Arcadia Quest... they're a little less welcome here when you're already balancing on a knife edge.

This may go higher as I play it more.  I really like the action.  Even though I play the Sins, I enjoy watching the heroes plan.  If you are impatient as the DM, you might pass.  There can be a lot of downtime between your turns.  (8-10 Hero turns vs 2-3 Sin turns)

This one fell flat for me.
I didn't see interesting choices, character death I don't mind per se. However *knowing* you will have to go through several characters removes any "connection" with the character you are playing.
So if I'm in the mood for this kind of game I'd much rather play Arkham Horror, Zombicide or Lobotomy.

Everything on the board feels quite strong, but there are smart rules for keeping the playing field fair (e.g. monsters can't ever leave spaces with heroes; heroes can leave spaces with monsters but have to take 1 mandatory wound). Things are constantly dying on the board, but then coming back. While it's certainly a game that pits two sides against each other, since both sides are expecting casualties, the deaths don't really hit too hard. Even when heroes die, they've done some things along the way to push towards the missions (and the hero that replaces them gets to keep the same number of gear cards as their predecessor). There are also some strong differences in the Others that set it apart from other dungeon crawlers and 1-vs-All games I've played before (e.g. city actions; Sins player reacts to hero turns as their own turns; ramping tension with Apocalypse track).

Was not a very enjoyable game - did not like the way the turns worked. I think it would have been better if it was like Hero Quest, where ALL the heroes take their turn and THEN the monsters take their turn. Having the monsters move at any time (despite having a limited number of moves), made it so that they could just pick off the first hero who moved and was vulnerable, which left heroes with very limited options and was not fun.

Mini first impression review:

Played one game tonight, I was Pride, played a 2 player game.

Other player had no problem playing all characters, in fact I think he preferred it that way.

Art was amazing, minis were off the charts amazing, every bit as good as blood rage.

Game play reminded me very much of zombicide at first, which I thought was an ok game.  As the game progresses, characters got better and beefed up which seemed natural and fun.  My power got better as well through a pretty cool system.  

The hero player definitely got to make more meaningful choices to try and stay alive and manage win condition.  I always like playing the bad guy, and my guys were ultra powerful, but all I did really was go around bashing skulls in.  Was fun but not as strategic, although I can see the potential for greater strategy with more complicated story objectives.

Good guy ultimately won, but it was very close.  I killed the hero in the final battle and they only had one left, so very close and tense.

The thurs act of the game was definitely more fun than the first act, so once the carnage ramps up it gets much better.

Overall very fun, looking forward to the epic amount of content I got.  The first scenerio was pretty fun .But mostly introduced me to core mechanics.

The art and minis blew me away, the game play was great but not Blood rage amazing (hard trick to top Eric, hard to top perfection).  But I think all desigN goals were met, and it's a game cmon should be vet proud of, and won I'm glad I own.  I think it can only get better with t be new stories we play, not to mention apocalypse content.

One of the better Overlord versus hero games. The game has a pandemic touch, more and more nastiness will be added by the Sin player over time. Heroes must then clean up tokens with bad effects. Both players can pin each others miniatures and that makes for a tactical display of choices. The game gets a more puzzling aspect because of this.

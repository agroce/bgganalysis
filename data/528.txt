The opening game is a little weak since you have to populate the board, and it's difficult to tell what are good and bad moves early on (perhaps I'll see things differently after more plays). Once you get into the thick of things, however, it becomes amazing.

One of the most fun things in abstract strategy games is forcing your opponents hand and keeping the tempo. In this game, that's all you do - to make any advances, you have to make sacrifices that force your opponent into setting up moves for you. There is a slight lull after a successful move (due to the board clearing up quite a bit), but aside from the beginning, the game is golden.

Beatiful components, too. I definitely prefer to slightly shorter blitz game - it's tighter and doesn't feel like you're losing much.

My all-time favorite abstract strategy game.  The game usually lasts about 10 moves, but the game will be decided in the 4th or 5th (that's where the most important moves will be made).  Definitely a game about sacrifice and control.

My favourite game.  ZERTZ is more a puzzle than a game and I absolutely love that.  My history with the game:

-Discovered the game online at Boardspace.net and played against Dumbot, losing every time and not really knowing what was going on.  You'd think after getting crushed repeatedly by an AI named Dumbot that I would hate the game, but I found it intriguing.

-Didn't play for a while, until a friend pulled it out at his place and we gave it a try.  The game suddenly clicked and I wanted to play it more.  Unfortunately my friend didn't like it much.

-Played against real opponents on Boiteajeux.net and the game started making more and more sense (and I started loving it more and more).

-Went back and played Dumbot, winning easily.

-Couldn't find a copy of the game for sale, but then I found it for free from someone here on BGG!  Amazing luck!

-Have introduced the game to a few people in real life, but the extremely steep learning curve means that I should probably deliberately lose to not turn them off the game completely.  Because of the forced captures and counterintuitive gameplay, it is very hard on beginners.  

-Still hoping to find more players to play in real life since I mostly play games online to try them before purchasing at the moment.  Since abstracts in general don't get much love and this game is fairly niche to begin with it doesn't look good, but I'm hopeful.

-I have finally found a game that, unlike Chess, I want to study to become better and I want to take a long time on each move to attempt to 'solve' it.  For whatever reason, that is fun for me.  Too bad the opportunity isn't there yet for ZERTZ, but maybe one day.

The end of this game is really quite tense and the middle is quite brain-burning.  I prefer Yinsh, but this is on a par with Dvonn.

The pieces are great, so it could be a coffee table game.

Gorgeous abstract. This would make a great "take it to the bar with you" game if it weren't for the balls. They would just roll away and you'd never find them again. The fact it has no board is awesome though. The game itself it fun. Relatively simple but it's one of those games that's more about forcing your opponent into a move than making excellent moves yourself.

Zertz is a pretty cool abstract that bends my brain around.  This is one of the only games I've played that brings out AP in me.  My brain just locks up when I try to work out the opportunities and dangers of a given board state.

I will not turn down a game, at least in the beginning of play while I am still seeking to learn it better.  However, I can also see myself offering a counter-suggestion of another abstract game (e.g. Yinsh or Dvonn).  

My sister described it well when she said it is like breathing.  The balls go out into play, and then they get sucked back into your hand, more go out, they come back in.  I amended that to say it is like breathing into the confines of a paper back, shortening your breath as you go.  All of this I like, and will relish playing out and puzzling over.  It is groundbreaking strategy while relying on classic checkers-esque rules.  However, it suffers because its strategy is way to straightforward.  After one play, I already felt like I knew what I needed to do to win, and win consistently... it is only a matter of time and effort to crunch out the result, like adding a long list of numbers.

Beautiful game (aesthetically), however I do not enjoy it so much. I rather play a tactical and dynamic game of YINSH that the heavily strategic ZERTS. It feels too much as chess. There is nothing bad about it, but for the last 20 years chess has not been my game of choice.

So far, I suck at this game. I don't know that I like it, but it plays out so interesting that I still want to go for it whenever I can.

It's a heavily tactical game, which is generally a place where I am weak. But it's such a difficult tactic to accomplish that it gets into the puzzle realm, so there is some hope that I will one day get decent. More likely, I'll give the game to my opponents more often than they actually do anything of their own accord to win.

Abstract

RATING: 10
A feature of several games in the Gipf series (Dvonn, Tamsk, Tzaar) is a reducing number of pieces that can be moved as the game progresses.  In Zertz a similar effect is achieved by reducing the playing area. The constricting space makes it easier to set up the forced moves that are at the heart of this game.  Tension inexorably ratchets up as in no other abstract game I know. Zertz has terrific depth for a game that plays quickly. And finally, it looks beautiful.

I had some free time so I made a Zertz set from wood bits.  (see the images section).  Excellent 2 player abstract.  Portable but be careful about knocking one of those balls to the floor.

This is an incredibly deep pattern recognition game. I wouldn't really call it a strategy or tactics game--pattern recognition game! The mental challenge of this game makes it worth owning for intellectual/educational purposes.  However, this depth will also turn off a lot of people and make it less accessible.  The aesthetics are good and I enjoy playing it, though it can be very frustrating if you're on the losing end. I had to rate this game slightly lower, because it isn't catching on with any of my friends. I think the game is too abstract and inaccessible for people.

RATING: 7
The nature of the game makes it theoretically solvable, but for mere mortal players that will not matter.  It is a mid-performer in the series comparible to DVONN.  The decreasing play area increases tension as the game goes on and helps play build to a climax with the final move that wins the game.  Enjoyable good abstract strategy.  [GTI Code: APSD]

Ah, ZERTZ. . . This is as close to a perfect abstract game as you'll ever find, in my opinion. Simple and elegant, basic and abstract, unbiased and open-ended, confounding and compelling. As with all the games in the GIPF project, there is something about the game that seems. . .elemental, as if a natural extension of the concept of "Game". But even moreso with ZERTZ. By far, this game is the most popular and highly rated of the GIPF games with me.

Probably one of my favorite short, cerebral games.  I really enjoy how the game board decreases in size as the game goes on, as well as how the color of the piece you choose to play can have reverberations unthought of when it was picked.  Probably never would have tracked this game down, but discovered it at a thrift store, played, and determined I had a winner!    Box is in good condition.  All pieces present and carefully accounted for.

[i]Posted: 5/13/06, Rated: 8[/i]

My first foray into the [i]Gipf[/i] project was with [i][GAMEID=7854],[/i] which I absolutely adored.  I discovered that I enjoyed new abstract games, and wanted to try another.  I labored over the decision as to which title I should buy next.  [i]ZÈRTZ[/i] emerged as the winner.

The "rings" in [i]ZÈRTZ[/i] don't provide the same tactile and visual pleasure as those found in [i][GAMEID=7854],[/i] but the marble-looking balls do.  It is easy to believe that they are members of the same family.

Like [i][GAMEID=2083][/i], if you have a capturing oppornity, you [i]must[/i] take it.  Unlike that other game, in [i]ZÈRTZ[/i] players use all of the balls indiscriminately; there is no concept of "mine" and "yours."  Therefore [i]ZÈRTZ[/i] is all about looking ahead, sacrificing pieces in order to force your opponent into a losing exchange.

I now have a confession to make to you: I [i]wanted[/i] to like this game.  I really, really did.

That's not to say that it's a bad game -- it most certainly isn't bad at all -- but it also means that I was willing to put up with a lot of frustration when I didn't "get it" right out of the box.  It was very hard for me to develop the right "vision" for this game.  Who am I kidding?  It's still a challenge.  But at least now it is starting to click.  [url=http://www.scat.demon.co.uk/zertz/strategy.htm]Steven Tavener's strategy guide[/url] has been immensely helpful in this respect.

[i]ZÈRTZ[/i] is an enjoyable game.  My two sons are having fun learning it.  Despite its initial difficulty, it is proving to be another winning entry from the [i]Gipf[/i] project.  Now, which one should I buy next...

ZERTZ is kind of interesting with the shrinking board size and the need to typically give something up to get something.  It just felt like most everything was very shortsighted.

Zertz falls short of the other GIPF games due to its puzzle nature.  The game lacks the intuitive feel of the rest of the series; it really requires a little study to grasp the various ways to grab a ball.  Thus, it loses the accessibility the series usually heralds.

RATING: 2
Abstract games with no luck are my favorite games, but I must say I am very surprised so many people like this one, as its strategic richness is near to zero. The material is beautiful but it is a kind of "nim game", with no  possible strategic development at all. The ONLY strategic thing your brain is focused on, is to force your opponent to do a mandatory move that will allow you to take marbles. So poor, so repetitive ! One of the worst game I ever played. There are really hundreds of better abstract games out there !

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Certainly hard to wrap your head around this abstract on the first play since I wasn't sure how the board would look at the end.   This appears to be a pretty unforgiving game, where a single mistake can quickly lead to your demise, so it feels a little like chess in that regard.  I'd like to play this again and hopefully be a little more competitive.  Like the marbles.  Initial rating a 7.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not as addicting for me personally as some of the other GIPF games.  Some complain about not liking the forced captures, but I don't have a problem with that.  What fries my brain is trying to remember how many of each marble you can capture to win, and trying to see how my opponent's captured marbles and my own fit into what moves I hope to make.  Feels like I'm reaching more than a little beyond my ability when I play this one.

My plays of it seemed to result in the winner being the one who didn't make the first mistake. The beginning also felt very opaque, with no feedback mechanism to know if I was making good moves or bad moves.

Now, the commentary on this game implies that, when I get really good, these two problems will no longer be there, but there isn't enough to draw me in right now to get me to play frequently enough to get good.

It doesn't surprise me that somebody found a way to force a win in this game.  There are losers all over the planet who ruin fun things for others.  You may notice that I don't own any of the Gipf series.  There is a good reason for this.  Wherever there is a 2-player abstract somewhere with limited piece interaction and choices (the exact opposite of games like Chess, Go, Blokus), somebody will sit up night after night figuring it out like a Rubik's cube to just ruin other people's good times.  What a f*cking waste.

I am not the Gipf fanboy that some are, but I have played most of them - Yinsh Dvonn and Tamsk as well. Although this is certainly better than Tamsk, this game falls short of Yinsh and Dvonn. The game components are beautiful. It really is breathtaking.

The idea of the potentials is interesting with these games, because they all feel like diversions, mini-games if you will. I admit it would be fun to try the whole experience. As it is, none of these games feels substantial on its own.

RATING: 6
It is truly amazing how different the GIPF games play and feel like! This one is unique with its shrinking board – a feature I like! However, I don’t love Zertz as much as many of the other games in the GIPF series, and I’m honestly not sure why. In my case Zertz does play quicker than the other games and I had thought I would like it more. I guess it’s maybe because the best move in Dvonn or Tzaar is rarely obvious - I won’t go as far as saying it is in Zertz, but I definitely think the gameplay is less interesting because of the fewer tough decisions. Maybe it’s because I haven’t played it a lot, but the same can be said about the other GIPF games which I do like. I will play it a few more times before deciding to keep it or sell it, but with so many other GIPF games I prefer I don’t see this one hitting the table often.

I'm rating this after a few plays with an online AI opponent. Ugh. I was hoping for a kissing cousin to Yinsh to play with my wife, but man... the right strategy is a bit obtuse for a beginner like me. Yinsh is quick to learn but hard to master. It feels "fun." With Zertz, I feel like I need to start reading strategy articles. It feels like chess. I can't play this well if I'm rushing through my moves. That doesn't mean it's a bad game... in fact, I'm impressed by how deeply strategic this game plays. However, I'm not sure I'm the audience for this game, and I don' want to have to study how to enjoy it.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
ZERTZ is one of the most cruel games that I have ever played, and like many abstracts, it is a title where equal experience is crucial for a competitive game. Being able to look ahead several moves is critical to being successful at this title, and the shrinking board combined with shared pieces makes the game very different. The first impulse players have is to try and set traps, which works in normal games where each player has their own pieces, but backfires horribly in this. Controlling the flow of the game by making sacrifices is the key to doing well at this, and learning how to do that effectively is quite fun. The sacrificial flow is what makes the game so cruel though. Because this game plays like Checkers in that an available jump is compulsory, one player can force another player to make moves for several turns in a row while simultaneously shrinking the board in a way that suits their plans. What this means is that at a certain point in the game, one player can just take over, forcing their opponent to make a series of moves, shutting the game down, and winning in evil fashion.

I should note that until I played ZERTZ I thought that I disliked abstract games, and I have since realized that is isn't the abstraction that bothered me before, it was just the amount that the big abstracts have been studied, and the neccessity of having at least some of that knowledge to compete with anyone...these newer abstracts solve that because even if there are people studying the game they are fairly dispersed and it is easy to find different people to play with who are on the same play level.

An abstract strategy games in which players attempt to capture marbles by jumping or claiming isolated marbles.  The board is made of circles arranged in a hex shape.  Each turn a player either jumps a marble or places a marble and takes away a hex.  If a jump can be made, a jump is forced.  As the board shrinks, players are forced to offer jumps.

ZÈRTZ is a bit of a strange game in the GIPF-series. I played it a few times against my sweetheart on various occasions, but every time we felt there was something missing. A few basic premises of ZÈRTZ made it into the later TZAAR&mdash;a shrinking amount of playing material, having three kinds of pieces which all contribute to the victory conditions. It is a fast game of forced moves, but the shrinking board becomes ... suffocating of sorts after a while. It happens too quickly, and the result is a slight 'meh'-ishly experience. As a result, this game has not made it into our collection to date. Perhaps another attempt will help us decide at last.

Components: Hefty, marble-like pieces that look good enough to eat. Though the rings are aesthetically pleasing, I might have preferred actual hexagons, to make it more visually clear which rings are land-locked.

Experience: A game of reducing possibilities; similar to DVONN, the first third of the game seems a bit arbitrary, merely serving to generate a unique set-up. Only mid-game do my actions seem to have perceivable consequences. I don't recall being this strategically adrift in a game, really not being able to identify what a good move is.

To quote the official rules, "each move is like a puzzle".

Simply working out how to set up some pieces to be detached or a capture that will let you capture a more valuable  piece is a fascinating puzzle.

It doesn't feel vital to look very far ahead, since it seems that there's a possible vital move (in or against your favour) every couple of turns and ensuring or averting that is all that can be done.

It reminds me of Puzzlequest in that both players are using the same board and have access to all the same moves. Miss a great one and your opponent will take it!

It's fascinating but I fear it may become dry and too heavy when I get any better.

Playing against Dumbot, I realise what I low level I and my opponent were playing at, anticipating only the next possible move. Even planning 3 moves ahead makes a massive difference and until I do that, I think the dumbot would remain unbeatable.

This is one of my favorite games.  It is at it's core a puzzle game about finding the "right" move.  Essentially you win by forcing your opponent to make unfavorable trades with you.  

This, more than any other game I know, is brutally unforgiving, and playing Zertz against someone much better than you might not be an especially pleasant experience.  Really though, this is exactly what made me fall so in love with Zertz, the feeling that I should be able to at least hold my own  in a game that had such simple rules.  

If you want to learn this game, or if you have just learned it and what like to become better, I strongly recommend playing it against the bot at www.boardspace.net . I would also recommend reading Steve Tavner's guide to the game, found in the files section here.

Kris Burm à développé un concept novateur qu’il a appelé le GIPF project. C’est un ensemble de six jeux qui peuvent se jouer à la fois indépendamment ou combinés autour de Gipf le jeu central.
Zertz est le troisième jeu du projet Gipf.

Préparation

Les disques destinés à recevoir les boules sont posés de façon à constituer un hexagone. Les boules sont à part et constituent une réserve commune aux deux joueurs.

But du jeu: être le premier à remplir une des quatre conditions de victoire :


1- avoir trois boules de chaque couleur
2- avoir quatre boules blanches sur les six
3- avoir cinq boules grises sur les huit
4- avoir six boules noires sur les dix
Dans la version d’apprentissage il suffit de deux boules de chaque couleur, ou trois blanches, ou quatre grises, ou cinq noires.

Le jeu

Quand arrive son tour le joueur examine la situation sur le plateau.
Si une prise est possible elle est obligatoire. La prise se fait comme aux dames en sautant. Elle doit se poursuivre si la configuration le permet et ce en utilisant toujours la même boule.
Sinon le joueur sélectionne une boule de la réserve et la place sur un emplacement libre de son choix de plus le joueur retire un disque vide et libre. Un disque est libre quand il peut être retiré sans bouger d’aucune façon les autres disques. Il se peut qu’à la suite du retrait d’un disque un îlot de un ou plusieurs disques soit créé. Si dans cet îlot il n’y a pas de disque vide, les boules sont toutes capturées.

Mon opinion

Kris Burm continue sa magistrale série de jeux abstraits avec Zertz qui est encore une réussite. La réalisation est encore une fois superbe, en autres singularités il n’y pas ici de plateau.
Zertz mélange les genres avec bonheur, la prise est empruntée au jeu de dames, les multiples conditions de victoire sont basées sur le principe de la collection et le phénomène de réduction du plateau était déjà utilisé dans Tamsk. 
Zertz n'est pas facile à maîtriser, surtout par la difficulté de se figurer mentalement une vision anticipée du jeu. C’est pourtant une condition absolue de la victoire dans ce jeu parfaitement équilibré. 
En effet pour pouvoir prendre une boule intéressante il faut forcer l’adversaire à faire une action dont le résultat sera un configuration de prise pour soi-même. Il n’y a qu’un seul moyen de forcer votre adversaire, c’est de le mettre en situation de prise obligatoire et donc de lui donner une boule. L’équilibre est très tendu et tout le jeu va consister à s’efforcer d’échanger une boule qui n’intéresse pas votre adversaire contre une qui vous intéresse. L’exercice est périlleux compte tenu des différents moyens de gagner et il faut se montrer vigilant pour ne pas avoir une mauvaise surprise en fin de partie.
La capture par isolement est relativement rare entre débutants. Elle est en revanche redoutable quand elle est pratiquée par des joueurs confirmés qui n'hesitent à donner une longue séquence de prise à leur adversaire uniquement pour retirer les disques génants. 
Il faut porter une attention particuliere sur les boules blanches qui permettent la victoire la plus facile avec quatre boules. Pour les obtenir il possible de donner jusqu'à 11 boules à son adversaire! Car avec 5 noires, 4 grises et 2 blanches il ne remplit pas encore une des quatre conditions de victoire.
Mon initiation à été plutôt laborieuse, Zertz est un jeu qui se découvre petit à petit non sans mal. Au fur et mesure des progrés l'effort intellectuel va grandissant et chaque action sucite une cascade d'interrogations. Si les régles sont faciles, le jeu n'est pas pour autant accessible, c'est pourquoi je lui ai retiré un point sur la note générale. Zertz reste cependant une merveilleuse création et je salue l'imagination fertile de son auteur.

RATING: 7
Another great abstract. Not as good as yinsh, but still very entertaining. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
A game of forced capture by jumping, with balanced win conditions, Zertz has a remarkable disappearing board that adds tension and excitement. Games between well matched opponents are always intense. One of my first "wow" moments in playing abstracts, and what made it clear that this would be one of my lifelong hobbies. This is what the more complex modern abstract games should aim for. My favourite of Kris Burm's GIPF series.

RATING: 7
It's unfair to Zertz to mention it in the same sentence as Checkers, but the comparison is unavoidable. The core idea in both games is to force your opponent into captures that set you up. I suspect that there is a 'right' way to play the game that I haven't figured out yet.

RATING: 5.5
This is a strange nugget. It has the elegance of all the other GIPF titles, but it somehow feels too scripted.  Playing against better players, after the first couple of moves one does not really play as such anymore, one just moves pieces for the opponent until the bitter end.  And, I don't like that, I want at the very least to have an illusion of controlling my own fate.  I don't like games, where one has no freedom of play and no option of a recovery because of a suboptimal opening move. However, the game is not a complete failure, because a match between similarly skilled players can still be very exciting.  But nothing I'd ever yearn to play, especially with better GIPF and other abstract games within an arm's reach.

This, 'Dvonn' and 'Yinsh' (all from the Gipf series) are the best pure abstract games since Go and Chess (imho). Love the 'bits'.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Another great little two player abstract game from the Gipf series. The game allows deeper tactical analysis than Dvonn. As a result it favours players who can look a few moves ahead but does not have quite the same surprise element to it as Dvonn where deep tactical analysis is a little more difficult. It is quick to play, allows a diversity of playing styles and provides a novel and interesting set of game mechanisms to explore. Great fun.

Players either play a stone onto a board, and remove a piece of the board, or be forced to capture a piece via checkers jump moves.  First player to take 4/5/6 white/gray/black stones, or 3 of each colour, wins the game.  Simple to explain, but wonderful to play.  One of the easier GIPF games to "see", at least for me.

A very simple abstract strategy game with a lot of forward thinking required....  and that's pretty much the hallmark of a good abstract strategy game.   Amazing components, very nice.   It's short.   Kind of like a cross between Chinese Checkers and Hey That's My Fish.   I don't need to play it again, it's just not my cup of tea, but I can see why people would want to have something like this in their collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What makes Zertz a great abstract game and raises it above some of the others that I have and have played is the dynamic board and that no player has ownership over the pieces. This combination makes it really unique and engaging. My first few times playing I kept having these "Aahhhh..." moments where something new, some new way to deceive and setup my opponent. I've played and owned most all of the GIPF series and this is the one that stuck around (Though I'll admit most I wouldn't mind bringing back into the collection). Just a great abstract game that is a pleasure to look at and seems to get deeper with every play. A highly underrated game if you as me.

I love abstracts, but this one fell flat. It looks beautiful and has a 'board free' board, but the game always plays out the same way and because of the board shrinking mechanic, the end game feels too claustrophobic to be much fun.

RATING: 4
It's abstract, so not something that is going to delight me all that much.  Still, it is an interesting design and the GIPF project has a cool layered system built into it.  I suspect if I tried the other GIPF games they'd all probably get the same rating, which is something I could tolerate playing if someone else really wanted to play.

This game is deceptively complex.  It's easy for people to play it once or twice, not really "get" it, claim they've figured out the mechanic and give up on... but they can never prove it.  Below the surface is many layers of advance strategy, forcing moves and balancing tradeoffs.  It's a great game, short, 2 player, it should be easy to find places to squeeze a quick game in.  I dig it.

Acquired in trade - excellent condition. 7/29/10

Still haven't made up my mind on this one.  I can't figure out the strategies yet the game intrigues me.  I've tried different approaches but don't know what has worked when I do win or what has not worked when I lose.  The good thing is that my 9-year old is able to beat me, which is good.  I am withholding my rating until I understand what is going on!!

Update 7-11-16:  Played 2 games in a row.  I finally "saw" the strategies and how to manipulate the game state and won twice.  My poor daughter was surprised the first game and figured out what I was doing during the 2nd game--but it was too late.  Rating increased to an 8!!

If you've never played before, I recommend that your first game be played against another player who also has never played Zèrtz.  It'll be more fun that way in that you can both figure out what strategies to use without getting immediately crushed by the other player.

[Abstract Strategy] [2P:4] By far my least liked game in Kris Burm's GIPF series of absrtract strategy games. It's almost the mirror image of YINSH, staid and clinical vs open and breezy. Playing ZERTZ feels like work, but much more than the other game of the series I'd rather not play, GIPF. My ranking of the series: TAMSK (9) YINSH (8), PUNCT (7), DVONN (6), GIPF (5), ZERTZ (4).

Without a doubt: my favorite of the Gipf games.  Simple rules: place a marble and remove a ring, or jump over a marble, checkers-style, and keep what you jump.  There are a few different win conditions (that's really the trickiest part).  The shrinking gameboard is classic gipf-gamestyle, but the flow in this game is may favorite of any two-player games we play.

Unfortunatly this game also requires both players to be of the same skill level to be interesting.

I've played Zertz over 30 times and find it to my least replaceable 2 player abstract next to chess. Unique among my most highly rated 2 player games, Zertz is seldom set up to play once...best of 3 is common.  Placing rings on slick surfaces doesn't work very well, so I found a solution in the form of a piece of green felt cut into a regular hexagon only slightly larger than the initial arrangement of the 37 rings...fits very nicely in the box.  This is currently my granddaughter's favorite game and it tickles me to no end that she can win some of our contests.

If you don't like Zertz, you don't like abstracts.  Hell, maybe you don't like games.

My favorite of the Gipf series.  Unlike Yinsh, it is terribly unforgiving to mistakes by new players.  I am intrigued by games with pieces common to both players, and this is my favorite.  

I ended up buying two copies of the Gipf Expansion #2 set so I can play with an extra-large hexagon.  However, I'm still waiting to try that.  (Note that newer Zertz sets already come with some extra rings, but only enough for the "ellipse", I believe.)

It seems like this game is mostly about skill and practice in seeing ways to force your opponent to do things you want. Maybe if I got past that point I'd see more strategy depth, but for now it looks like it'd have a strategic upper limit on me.

An excellent abstract strategy game.  It took me a number of plays before I really was able to get a handle on the "give to take" strategy you need to follow to win.  [If you find the game confusing or frustrating at first I'd recommend reading some strategy tips online, the game plays very differently once you've got the hang of it.]  If there's a problem, it's that for experienced players, there is a definite benefit to going second.  The only way to fix this it to buy the GIPF Project Set 2 to get extra rings.

I really like Zertz, even though it has a serious failing.

The "forced move" is a critical mechanism. However, it usually results in one player spending an inordinate amount of time trying to devise a long string of moves that guarantees a win. This is not over-analysis however because very often such moves exist! For the analytically-minded, this is a great thing, but if you're the other player, you're no longer really playing.

This is a great abstract from the Gipf series. The basic play consist of placing a ball then removing a disk. This limits future plays be reducing the number of available spaces to play rather quickly. However, if you can jump another ball, you must. This is how you win, but it is also how you force your opponent to make less than optimal moves. Great fun, one of my favorites of the Gipf series.

A strong entry to the Gipf series. A mix of board manipulation and checkers-style capturing. Removing areas from the board do quite a bit to opening up strategies and getting yourself out of tight corners. Each game seems to begin the same, but quickly turns into an interesting exchange of control. Second favorite to Yinsh.

I've played this the most of all the GIPF project games, and have owned it the longest. As with other GIPF project games, I feel like the disparity between differing skill levels is too great. It's just not as fun for the person who is learning the game if their opponent has even played once or twice before. I imagine that a battle among really skilled players would be complex and impressive, I just don't get to play enough that it will ever be me in that situation.

I've realized that in all my comments of other GIPF games played (as of 17.12.2013) that I keep referring back to ZERTZ. There is a reason for that. ZERTZ is not only my first played from the GIPF series, but it is also my favorite because it is so easy to explain (i.e., it is like checkers on an ever shrinking board in which none of the piece are "yours") and, while the strategies aren't 'transparent' they aren't as opaque as for some of the other in the series (which is perhaps why ZERTZ has been solved at very high level play). The materials are incredibly beautiful, and another plus is that the game does not require a board (meaning that it can be played at a pub, on wet grass, you name it).

Made it with 2 size washers super glue and 3 different color D6 Dice - it looks and plays awesome - way to cool!  The first play is like - WTF is this, there is no strategy.  Then the 2nd game you see something and think there may be something there.  The next game you understand what it could be, maybe.  The next one your trying new things and thinking this is  A AWESOME GAME!  Yep there is a lot of strategy here, just crazy cool game, but man what a brain burner, no way I play this with Bo or Mike, he he

I think this is visually the most stunning of the GIPF games; unfortunately, I'm not certain if the game holds up quite as well as the others after a few solo plays.

I may be wrong but somehow the board reduction combined with forced capture mechanic means that less subtlety is required to win in ZERTZ than the other GIPF series games I have played, though certainly vision and forethought are still rewarded.

But like all the GIPF games there is a potential to explore and change strategies, and I might well see this impression change - 6.75 initial rating.

This game is SO WEIRD.  But I like it. Less intuitive and more complex than YINSH, this game calls for a kind of thinking that I have seldom engaged in elsewhere.

It's like Checkers... on a hexagonal board... that keeps shrinking... and both players have access to 3 different colours of pieces... you're trying to collect pieces of various colours... and there are several ways to win...

First played November 23rd 2010. This two player game is taught in a few minutes and played in about 15 minutes. Black disc are placed in the center area and there is a common area with three color balls (black, grey, and white). On a players turn, he grabs a ball (any color) and places it on one of the black disc and then must remove a disc if he can. You can only remove a disk if it's not bound by other disc. If you place a ball such that you can jump (like checkers) another ball, you must. If you jump a ball you don't take a disc. If you seperate some disc from the main group, you collec them all. First person to capture three of each color, 4 white, 5 grey or 6 black balls wins! This is a great filler game for two players.

I'm not a big fan of abstracts and I don't like games where you can be forced to make a specific play.  It's too easy for a player to 'solve' the game and trick you into wasting an hour of your life (not that this has happened to me, but it begs for the opportunity).  I prefer more control/decisions and, I don't know, maybe a theme to keep my wee, tiny brain interested.

I like it much better than checkers.  But then, I don't really like checkers, so that isn't saying much.

There's something quite mysterious and alluring about zertz for me. I really like the sort of dual, at-odds space element with adding pieces to the board as it shrinks. Also the way there are no player-centric "pieces" or colors, and how everything is both controlled and competed for by both players at all times is a really unique and engaging strategic gamespace. It has a very zen quality to it that immediately struck a chord with me upon first playing it. It's between this and punct as to which gipf game is my favorite. I have a feeling the more I play zertz, the more I'll gravitate towards preferring it.

Unlocking this game was a fantastic experience. When you first start seeing possible moves and ways to win is virtually impossible, but as you and your opponent progress there is so much to discover. 

Definitely the strangest abstract I have ever played and also one of the cleverest. However once the game is learned and the many subtleties discovered, I've found no reason to pick it up again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Good one.

To play really well you need to plan a few moves ahead.  It's probably a trivial statement in case of a logic game, but here it's especially true (and diffcult).  I'm yet to master it.

RATING: 7
Zertz is a puzzle like abstract game requiring you set up and sacrifice something of yours to get what you want. Very interesting just like the rest of the Gipf series and takes anywhere from 2 - 5 games to get up to speed. 

The ability to control your opponent is key, if he has a jump to make he HAS to do it so this is a key tactic used for positioning to set yourself up and controlling the way the game takes shape while leaving you the initiative. This is harder than it sounds as strategy is somewhat alluding so the game has a nice challenge to it.

Lack of long term planning exists but a great tactical game.  Big strength for this game is the multiple ways to win, love this aspect which keeps you and your opponent 'on your toes'.  

[u]UPDATE[/u]: After a lot of games Zertz it does almost feel solvable, once a few pieces have been removed it is possible to dominate the board by leading the opponent around (very good players have done this to me by me making one wrong move), this must be why the option to play with a bigger board is there???

There is something addictive about placing marbles and removing rings. Moves consist of forcing your opponent's marbles around the board via compulsory jumps on an ever-shrinking board. Because of its puzzle-like feel, you have to be in the mood. (See my [thread=340386]review[/thread].)

The ever-shrinking play area adds a nice twist to a seemingly simple game of checker-like moves using marbles that neither player really possesses.  A great deal of strategy is required to force your opponent into a 'compulsory' capture while you set-up the ideal capture of your own.

The rules are quite simple but the game really forces you to plan ahead, moreso than I've found in TAMSK, but maybe not as much as YINSH.  I like the pieces, though the set-up time is a little more annoying.  I need to play this a few more times to really get a handle on the game.  But a few tries have led me to believe that it's just as deep as the others in the series.  I will enjoy discovering the game.

Update: Played some more, I'm finally beginning to understand!  I still don't like the setup (though it's nowhere as bad as Hey, That's My Fish), but the game is a lot of fun and seeing it take off like wildfire with a bunch of students to whom I taught the game showed me what a wonderful game this is.  Up to an 8.

Nincs játéktábla, a játéktér kis levágott hegyű kúpokból áll, amelyekre golyók helyezhetők. Ezek a kúpok fogynak, szűkül a játéktér, de közben a golyókkal át kell ugrálni egymáson, így a golyók is begyűjtésre kerülnek egy-egy játékos által. Három különböző színű golyótípus van, de egyik játékosnak sincs saját színe, meghatározott számút kell gyűjteni mindegyikből a győzelemhez. Kiváló! :)

I call it:  "Checkers in a nuclear wasteland."

You can make one of two moves per turn:  Place a marble AND remove a board piece (if possible) -OR- Jump an adjacent marble if possible (multiple jumps in any direction possible)

You win by collecting one of 4 predefined sets of marbles...adding much depth to the game, because now you can sacrifice one color not needed by your opponent as long as you get what you need the next turn.

Sacrifice is key, since jumps are "compulsory" in this game...meaning you must jump if possible.  This means you'll be clamoring to set your opponent up, thinking a few steps ahead...but you better not ignore your opponent, because they'll be doing the same.

Who's gonna break first and cause a jump...can you force your opponent into your trap?  It's getting easier every turn as the board diminishes...easier to screw up.

My opinion: not as much fun-factor as YINSH due to much planning and almost chaotic reactions.

I HATE the way the pieces slip around if you're playing on a smooth surface (i.e. I played on a lunch table). My friends were getting sick of this game, because the pieces kept slipping around. Think the company should give some rubber mat that holds the pieces when you're jumping etc. But overall, the game is a very original idea.

RATING: N/A
In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel.

Excellent two player abstract in the Gipf series in which you choose either to place a marble and remove a base from the board (shrinking the playing field) OR you must jump a marble if the option is available a la checkers.  Four different winning conditions exist as you either try to collect two of each type of marble (3 different color marbles exist), collect 3 white marbles, collect 4 gray marbles, or collect 5 black marbles.

A wiseacre's game.  Couldn't figure out which game it reminded me of throughout my first few plays, then I pinned it:  Nim!  This is essentially a reworking of Nim, the classic wiseacre game where you have 5 rows of varying numbers of toothpicks and have to avoid being the last player to take a toothpick.  Nim is a solved game -- you will always win if you know the solution, rooted in binary mathematics, and your opponent doesn't.

Zertz is too much like that for me to enjoy it.  I don't like the idea of a game where we share pieces and the idea is to push your opponent into sub-optimal move traps.

I am agnostic as to whether Zertz is as solvable as Nim.  But the fact that the game IS solved for the standard-sized ring setup (first player always wins if he knows the solution) suggests to me that this is a game of a puddle's depth.

I loved this game until I started playing a lot - the game boils down to managing how to give away enough marbles to get the win. Two evenly matched players will have a lot of fun, but if you play with someone better, it becomes an exercise in jumping through their setup for the win.

Checkers from an alternate universe. The jumping of pieces checkers-style makes the more unusual rules, like not owning pieces and removing spaces from the board, a bit easier to swallow. There are several definitions of the "blitz" and "tournament" versions; generally Tournament rules use and require capturing more pieces, while the board may or may not be larger.

My second gipf game but I prefered Yinsh much more. Firstly, it was a hassle setting up the board (in my opinion). Secondly, I reckon Yinsh had a much nicer chaotic effect as opposed to Zertz. But all in all, I think it's a great game with nice checkers mechanics in play plus a constantly reducing board size. It's also a much quicker game to play.

One of my absolute favorite abstracts and my second favorite of the GIPF series (this is my wife's favorite game that she'll play at any time). Unique yet similar.

This is the version that comes with 12 extra board pieces for the extra complexity tournament rules, although one is lost, only 11 extra are needed, the 12th is meant as a spare.

I've been really enjoying this one so far.  There's a lot for me to learn, but I WANT to learn it, which is a good sign.  I have a feeling this could be a deep thinker/problem solver if you cared to "grow" with it.  Until then, it's a fun lighter game in which you can try to optimize your current and next turns.

It is SO fun to see your victory 3 moves in advance, and hand to your opponent ball after ball after ball, only to set yourself up to take the last one you need!

Such a clever game. It flips things around by requiring you to force your opponent do your work for you, giving up something you can afford to lose in exchange for them setting you up for something better. It requires a mental shift that I find enjoyably brain-burning, and it lasts just the right amount of time -- much like Hive, which I love.

It felt chaotic the first time, clicked a bit more the second time, and on the third play I felt like I could access some of its depth. The planning ahead reminds me of chess, a game I dislike, but it's not really chess-like; I enjoy the planning in Zertz. And I love that the board shrinks, propelling the game to an end state whether you like it or not.

Unless the players are of equal strength, the game is miserable.  Zertz is worse than most abstracts in this sense because you can force your opponent's moves, not even leaving them a sense of control.  As long as the players are equal, the game is interesting (but not a whole lot of fun).

I've played Zertz more than anything else this century, and after >100 plays, (lots of plays before I started logging, when I owned a reasonable number of games) I still learn something new with every game. This is the game I'll be teaching to my grandchildren.

...I feel like I need to go into a little more depth on something I still claim to be my favorite game. Fact is, it's hard to say why. I've had a lot of fun playing Zertz; I've played with a very large number of different people, in a large number of inappropriate places. That counts for a lot. But why Zertz? 

I like two-player games; in particular I like two-player games  with no randomness and no hidden information. Zertz is such a beast. I like to be able to evaluate potential moves on basic principles -- which might mean thinking about where your opponent would most want to go, something I picked up early on playing [gameid=188], or trying to find moves that serve multiple purposes. I find a lot of valuable thoughts on strategy in Ea Ea's strategy guide for [gameid=11997] at http://ea.ea.home.mindspring.com/*tactics.html - a game which I've never played, but if you read the article, you know how good it is. Well, [u]Zertz doesn't have that[/u]. To some extent, one doesn't even evaluate [i]moves[/i], rather sequences of moves. But even that evaluation process is very specialized.

What makes Zertz distinctive is
* the pieces on the board belong to neither player, so you can't "build up" to something devastating,
* the need for sacrifice - and for me, much of the 10 rating lies in this point - which isn't mentioned explicitly in the rules because it doesn't have to be,
* excellent replayability - with the shrinking board, every game feels different,
* it looks fantastic,
* and [i]something[/i] that keeps me coming back to it, despite the fact that there are other games I [i]should[/i] like better.

As a newcomer to the wider world of combinatorial games, Yinsh feels more easily accessible. Zèrtz, on the other hand... I try putting some marbles on the board, the AI at Boardspace sets up a "one black for three whites" sacrifice, and I'm like "How does it do that?"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The GIPF series seems to rule and as a whole this series is truly a work of art and beauty. Inspiring and a no-brainer recommendation for fans of abstracts. 

The shrinking "modular" board in ZÈRTZ is a very cool idea, as you don't need a game board, only the rings and the marbles. This makes the game quite easy to make/manufacture on your own, too. It's everything the games in the series are: elegant, serene, quick and tactical, while also being strategical for brainiacs, as it's a game of complete information.

As theme vs. abstracts go, I actually deduced "the theme" (water) of this one without checking it out, as the shrinking board and the colours reminded me of ice floats.

Typical game for Gipf series. Essentially checkers with a shrinking board and some extra rules.

Very fun, lots of thinking, plays fast, lovely components, relatively cheap.

Des sept jeux du projet que je possède et connais, c'est possiblement le plus effrayant! Nous ne sommes pas habitués à partager nos pièces avec notre adversaire, mais ici, pas le choix!

Effrayant, peut-être, mais en même temps, je suis séduit par ce jeu! Ça prend du temps avant de pouvoir en apprécier les richesses; la lecture de cette [b][u][url=http://mrraow.com/uploads/Articles/zertz/Strategy/strategy.html]analyse[/b][/u][/url] peut nous aider à y voir plus clair. 

ZÈRTZ exploite admirablement bien le concept de "zugzwang", où le joueur cherche à établir une position où l'adversaire se voit forcé de jouer un coup non désiré.

Longue vie à ZÈRTZ!

Edit: note de 8.7 datant de mai 2013 revue à la baisse --> 8.25. GIPF (8.9) et YINSH (8.8) se démarquent clairement comme étant mes deux préférés, d'où ici le réajustement. ZÈRTZ maintient tout de même la 3e position dans mon appréciation de la série, suivi de TZAAR (7.7) en 4e position.

RATING: 4
Checkers on acid. I'm not big on seeing at least half your moves controlled by your opponent due to the mandatory jumping rule. The end result is the need to plan several moves out which I also don't care for. Easily the weakest of the GIPF games I've seen.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wow, this is an amazing game.  Absolutely fantastic how the board is different everytime you play, this really makes it great.  Along with the multiple win conditions it really is a complex game.  It is really outstanding when you run out of balls in the box and actually have to start playing your own already won balls (probably the best part of the game).

Abstract game of the GIPF series. Try to collect sets of colored balls by jumping them, but play area shrinks each time a play is made. Quite fun to play, probably my favorite of the GIPF series based on it's quick play time. I just wonder if the tactics are limited (eg force an opponent to jump, so you can jump him back to get the color marble you desire).

My wife picked this up for me as a gift before we had children.  I enjoyed the concept, but had a terrible time finding folks to play against (she isn't a gamer).  Now that my kids are playing games I've picked it up again.  It plays quickly, and the kids picked up on the concept fast.  I may revisit this later to improve my rating based on our play.  The game also came with some extra "Potentialz" pieces that combine with other games in the series, but we haven't had any use for them.

RATING: 10
Zèrtz surprises at first for the shrinking playing surface (used for Tamsk earlier in the series, but in a completely different way) and the availability of the balls for both players - this indeed leads to a rather quirky style of play, driven by sacrifice and isolation of balls. 

It's here where the game reveals its nastiness - since the same moves are available for both players, timing and surprise are key to win (which of course gets more and more difficult as the board gets smaller).

Brutal and unforgiving, Zèrtz is easily the boldest game of the GIPF project, and it embodies all which is good about the series: short, elegant, challenging, and a joy to touch.

I love this game. Why did it take me so long to discover the GIPF series? I think it was because the colours and pieces looked a bit boring - but the gameplay is so far from boring.ZERTZ and YINSH are my favourite games at the moment (even though I usually lose - it just makes me want to try again with a different tactic and with the short play time that is possible).

This game is my favorite of the Gipf project.  I, however, am not that good at the strategy in the game.  I miss blatantly obvious moves and have trouble setting myself up for moves in advance.  I think that is one of the reasons I like the game.  One of the beauties of the game is the fact that the game board slowly disappears as the game advances.    The components of the game are fantastic. They are a tactile treat with which to play.  My wife however, will not play this game.

RATING: 7
This one is a little hard to digest in my first few plays.  Sometimes it seems difficult to figure out moves that are better for you than for your opponent.  You really have to be aware a) your opponent doesn't have to move the marble you just played, he could move the one next to it, and b) your opponent doesn't have to move the marble in the direction you want.  Seems obvious, but it's funny how often a new player can overlook these.

Played 13 games over the last week against a friend, every single game showed us new patterns and tactics which led to discussing the game (which led to playing another match).  An excellent abstract brain-burner that forces you to give ground to your opponent to create an advantage.  However, it's a rich-get-richer game where having a lead gives you the advantage of greater flexibility.

Nothing else quite like this, two players playing sort-of-draughts on a 3-way board that shrinks while both play all 3 sets of pieces at the same time!  The Gipf games set the bar for modern abstracts (both for play and presentation) and this is no exception.
Clean and deep, and doesn't outstay its welcome.

Really good looking pieces, mind-consuming gameplay and some tough decisions. This game is simultaneously chaotic and totally controlled. I was really impressed by this game!

As with the other GIPF games, you need a while to practise this. But learning some strategies are always rewarding. Double points for quick gameplay (usually under that 30 min stated on box).

This one proved me that abstract games can be really rewarding!

This is a unique and interesting game.  The game mechanisms are simple and well thought out.  Fun and intriguing to look at as well.  I've never played another game like it.

No board per se so it packs easy.

Having played this about a hundred times, I think it is not as deep as some of the other Gipf Family games.  It's tactical, but there's no deeper strategy to employ.  I'm knocking it down a rating point.

It is cool looking with a unique mechanism, which is enough for a quick 10 minute game.

Possibly tied to being my favourite of the Gipf project with Tamsk, though Zertz is more "fluid and variable" having more replay value. Really need to play several games to experience endgame situations so as to provide foresight for tactics and strategy during future games. Being less fun than Tamsk didn't see Zertz getting those further playings, and because of no hidden info or random element, the most experienced/thoughtful player would dominate, so not a game for players of different capacities.

Of any game I've played, this one has the largest descrepency between simplicity of rules and complexity of strategy.  You and your opponent play with the same pieces, so the idea is to set something up to benefit yourself, but in the process, your opponent can take what you've set up.  So the real goal is to set it up so your oppoent has to set something up for you.  But then, in the process of setting that up, your opponent can take it from you so you really want to set up your oppoenent to set you up to set your opponent up to set... you get the idea.

One of the coolest features of the game is also one of its minor drawbacks. The rules are very simple and easy to learn, and results in a very innovative strategy game that is more fun than checkers, for instance. I can't think of another game where moves involve removing part of the "board." The fact that the "board" is removable rings is superb, and yet also rquires extra care to ensure that those left behind keep their shape, so that it is clear which rings are free to be removed and which are not.

But whether despite or because of that, Zertz is a unique strategy game that can be learned and played quickly, and everyone who likes such games as Chinese Checkers should give it a try. You'll be impressed!

I really like ALL of these GIPF series games. They are crisp, original and engaging. The unique aspect of this one (compared to the others) is that you can force your opponent to make a particular play against their will as you attack something else. (much like a CHECK move does in Chess). This game is OUTSTANDING and the shortest play time in the GIPF series. (GIPF has the longest).

RATING: 5
I know this sounds wussy, but I think this game is just a little too deep for me to enjoy very much.  It seems to be one of those abstracts that require a fair bit of study to reap reward from.  At my level of play, it's not very interesting, because I'm not experienced enough to recognize a subtly clever move (as opposed to the obvious, flashy moves), or an insidious threat impending.  So there's not a lot of tension.  Just sort of an after-the-fact "Wow, that was neat, when you jumped 4 marbles!"  But most of the actual play is just sort of flailing around, trying not to set up my opponent for an obviously good move.  It's not a bad game, and I'd play it if asked, it just feels like to get to the next level, to be able to have any sense of competition, I'd have to play it about 50 more times.  And I'd still be a pretty weak player.  So:  Too deep for me.

Excellent game of dwindling land masses and forcing your opponent to capture a marble on the board so he opens up a capture space or two for you on the board. The components are incredible as well. The marbles are big and sturdy, and the curved game board pieces as well, so it's just visually appelaing and fun to play for that alone.

Visual Appeal: (4)
This game definitely has a unique appearance. Possibly the most unique out of all the GIPF series games due to the lack of a board. The box art is very Zen. Not visual per se, but the box is so noisy! all those marbles just roll loose in the box with no dividers. I guess I could put them in bags or something.

Components: (4)
Speaking of no dividers, the box is really the only weak point components-wise. The marbles and discs are very polished and have a satisfying weight to them. The box however is flimsy and seems as if it would disintegrate if it came in contact with any amount of water. I believe I have the 1st edition, so I'm sure packaging has changed. 

Theme: (0)
The theme is water maybe? I heard somewhere that the GIPF series games all had natural elements associated with them. I'm not going to dig too deep here.

Learning: (5)
It is really easy to explain. I think I've got it down to three sentences. Scoring takes a couple of "How many do I need to win again?" questions during the first game, but it's not too hard to remember.

Gameplay: (5)
Tensions rise as the board loads up with marbles. I like that forcing your opponent to jump is a part of this game. Deconstructing the board and placing marbles in such a way that your opponent has no choice but to play right into your hands is a powerful feeling. When it doesn't work against you that is...

Overall Fun: (4)
This is a neat little challenge for 2p that can kill some time between other games, but it takes a bit longer to setup than it would if there was a board. It has plenty of tough decisions, but never so many possible moves that players would get AP. Sometimes with good preparation, the game can end quickly by scoring many marbles in one go. That's OK though because you can just set up and play again!

RATING: 4

This is more a puzzle than a game. This is reinforced by the fact that fun in this game is strictly zero-sum. If you're having tons of fun, it means your opponent is bored out of his mind. This is because the game see-saws between being a puzzle and a spectacle due to the mechanisms of forcing moves. Either you're having fun making all the moves, or you're the bitch making all the moves your opponent tells you.

This means this is a puzzle for one player, while a boring spectacle for the other. This means this is a retarded "game". The lack of player pieces means this game is severely lacking in asymmetry. Anything you want to do, your opponent can do, and the only difference is he takes his turn before and after you.

Another nice abstract from the Gipf series, again with beautiful components.  Checkers-style, but the great mind-bend here is how you have to imagine how your opponent will react to your move.  If you set up a move that will get you two pieces, your opponent will get them so you have to set up a move in that you can respond to their move with something that gives you the advantage.  And all this in a nice quick game too.  Good stuff.

I've rated this a 7 after one play. I expect this to go up, but right now I am trying to figure out some of the basic strategies and tactics. Not a bad game.

This is a solid abstract.  There is a fear that the more experienced player will be constantly forcing the lesser into plays where they have no control of their actions.

Clever abstract with nice pieces that's all about forcing your opponent to make bad moves. The board shrinks as you play. Of the GIPF series, ZERTZ is the most puzzle-like. It's a bit counterintuitive, but once you get it, it's effectively solved by if-then reasoning; of the series, it's the least amenable to intuitive play. Neither my favourite nor my least favourite, but somewhere in the middle.

Excellent abstract strategy. The shrinking board is delightful and semi-unique in my collection.

I didn't like this as much as the other games from the Gipf  series. Probably because the focus is too much on running through a decision tree, where you think through your own actions and your opponent's possible reactions. This makes it feel a lot more like chess or draughts. I really don't like the fact that you must play the first moves in a predetermined way or lose against a skilled player. That kind of over-analysis has lessened my enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 7
ZÈRTZ's strong focus on forced capture, like draughts cranked up to eleven, makes the tactical play pretty obvious: sacrifice this to forced capture so you can gain that. But in terms of long-term strategy I have absolutely no clue. It's even more opaque to me than Go -- how do you develop a long-term positional advantage when both players share the same position? 

The weird four-way set-collection win condition seems rather inelegant, but it can't be denied that it provides a lot of flexibility and keeps sacrifice a tense proposition.

My main issue is that, while it's an interesting, difficult game that I am sure would reward repeated play, it's so hard to play well that I'm not sure it's suitable for dilettantes like me who flit casually from game to game. YINSH, for example, is much easier.

[RGG 2000 edition] {GIPF, Abstract, racing; modular-board, checker-variant} A nice abstract game even though it's not the deepest game of GIPF. It's unique in GIPF series because the game board is shrinking in the play, which forces the players to confront in late game. The 4 winning goals and all common pieces are also unique features of ZÈRTZ among other GIPF games. It's of very good replay value because each play is very different from the previous ones.

ZÈRTZ is engaging because there is always a chance of winning for either player in the whole play, no matter how one lags behind. Early settings of the marbles on the board in very important. Player mindlessly places marbles at the early stage will surely lose. It's quite difficult to formulate a long-term strategy and it is senseless to select a particular winning goal from beginning. Wise tactical moves are more important. Besides, it's hard to catch up in late game because a player has fewer choices with smaller board with many marbles.

I think ZÈRTZ is the most stylish game in GIPF series :)

Dvonn and Zèrtz are the two games I never get bored with. Have I ever commented on the beauty of the components? Not having a board, Zèrtz is probably the most beautiful one from that point of view in the entire Gipf series. The only flaw I found, if I can call it so, is that the grey marbles might have been a more interesting color. Yeah, that's all you can complain about this game, really. All Gipf series games apart from Gipf and Punkt have a distinctive color beside white and black. Dvonn has red, Yinsh has blue, Tzaar has silver and gold. I would have chosen a distinctive color rather than grey for the marbles in Zèrtz. Possibly an aquamarine blue. But I'm digressing. I haven't found a game that matches or surclasses Dvonn, but Zèrtz is maybe the one which comes closer.

I have decided that Yinsh is the only Gipf Game I really want to have in my collection.  I have so many great things for two players that I don't have time to keep a couple of extra abstracts as well.  The more I have the less I play the ones I want to play.

RATING: 8
This game is amazing to look at, but wrapping your head around the rules makes it a little tougher than the other GIPF games to teach non-gamers.  It's all about sacrifice and the strategy borders on counter-intuitive.  Still, fun with the right people.

played several games, our first session. Thoroughly impresses. GREAT game. May rate higher as strategy with regard to marble colour selection, and which pieces to take off board become more apparent.


printed off the neat picture board, will decopage it onto a piece of board. Using some 10-cent washers, and marbles that were $1 for huge bag. ?Hope it's ready to go Saturday.

Ooh, pretty pretty game.  And mind-numbingly evil.  I'm sort of glad I'm not so good at it that the regular-sized board is solved, as that would ruin the fun.  For me, the regular-sized board is fine, and challenging.  I'll keep it that way.  Darkness is good.

RATING: 5.5
This one was just ok. Like most in the GIPF line, its a fairly short abstract. I'd rather play Yinsh by a long shot over this one. The components are top notch and the game looks great, but its just not very exciting.

**UPDATE: My least favorite of the series. Having parts that will easily roll away is a pain. The main reason this is my least favorite - it is solvable and thus flawed.

Zertz gets my vote as the most accessible of the Gipf series games.  You can pull out Zertz, teach it to a new player, and play a game all in twenty minutes.  The tension cranks up as the ever-shrinking board dwindles, and the components are excellent.  It's a nice change of pace from most other abstracts where one player is the white pieces and the other player is the black pieces.  Great game.

I prefer this to PÜNCT, but like YINSH, TZAAR and GIPF better than either.  Maybe it's the "chinese checkers" feel of the game that's too familiar.  The first few moves seem like a mystery to me, as I'm never sure what I'm doing until several pieces are on the "board".  Speaking of boards, I might have preferred if the game came with one.

RATING: 9
Oh, this is a good one. Needs to be played a few times to start to get it. Not that it's super deep, but it's different enough from what you've played before that it takes a while to catch on. The more you play, the more various strategies emerge. The shrinking board is great, because it forces quick conclusions, so you can play multiple games in one sitting. If you're good at checkers, that can be an advantage. My favorite pure abstract, bar none.

Stunningly beautiful little abstract game, as with pretty much all the GIPF games.

Described correctly as a dance in the rulebook. With completely shared pieces, trying to force your opponent to make captures that give you a good position. Becomes sublime as each piece placed reduces the size of the board, you can modify it to avoid certain moves, and even capture pieces you can isolate in a corner. Multiple victory conditions (balanced vs specialised) work wonderfully as well.

I have played this quite a few times now.  It gets better the more you play it.  Initially, I was very disappointed with this purchase, but have grown to treat it as a challenge.  It appears to be that you have to play this game very aggressively.

RATING: 7
[thing=528][/thing] is part of the Gipf series of abstract games. In [thing=528][/thing] players either add a ball (in one of three colors: black, gray or white) and, afterwards, remove a piece of the edge of the board; or jump over a ball in order to take it - if is possible to take a ball, the player must do it, but it isn't required to stop just after the ball taken, being possible to move the ball used to jump over further away, be to prevent the other person to take advantage of your movement, be to continue the movement and move over other balls.

The goal is to have three balls of each color, or six black, or five gray or four white. The first person to achieve any of these goals, wins.

As is common to all Gipf series games, [thing=528][/thing] has few rules, being quick to teach and easy to play, yet it has a nice depth of choices built in (where to put a ball, which piece to remove, which color to add). The gameplay is smooth and easier to grasp than that of [thing=7854][/thing], and more complex than that of [thing=108][/thing]. [thing=528][/thing] has a learning curve, but isn't very steep.

Also, as is on par with the series, the components are excellent, giving a great tactil and visual impression. [thing=528][/thing] would nicely serve as decoration in most shelfs.

The intensity of [thing=528][/thing] is smaller than in other titles of the series - normally is just a matter of adding balls to the board, usually in the outer border and corners, as to not give the other player the chance to take them; or use the center of the board to make the other person to take a ball that might not be in her best interest, in a way that will allow you to take one or more that you truly wants. Simple and effective, but does means that, for a good number of rounds, the game can enter in a sort of boring state.

In my preferences, [thing=528][/thing] is above [thing=7854][/thing], which is too deep and strategic to be fun to me, and bellow [thing=108][/thing], which is a true romp of entertainment. Either way, [thing=528][/thing] goes recommended.

My favorite GIPF game.  I really like the shrinking board that accelerates you towards the ending with dual victory conditions!  I've recently discovered the tournament rules are even way more fun than the blitz rules.  And, if you run out of spheres to place you must place one of your already captured spheres! This game is exciting when you find a forced win your opponent cannot overcome, sometimes several moves deep. The aspect of seizing separated islands adds to the depth.  As for 2-player abstract strategy games, this is one of the very best! My order of favorites in the GIPF series are:

ZERTZ
TZAAR
DVONN
PUNCT
GIPF
YINSH
TAMSK (taken out of GIPF series replaced by TZAAR.)

Once I saw the strategy of "giving up" balls to get more valuable ones, I realized the appeal of Zèrtz. It isn't a game of attrition, but rather a game of keeping the initiative to prevent your opponent from having a chance to win. My only quarrel with this game—at least for me—is the lack of depth beyond that. Either I'm not good enough for a further strategy, or the game is relatively straightforward. Either way, the strategy does provide for quite a bit of thinking, and quite a bit of fun.

Zertz is my third game in the GIPF series. I like it, but it ranks lower than Yinsh and Dvonn. While the ruleset is quite simple, I am not sure I enjoy the checker-style capturing of pieces. Often times, looking ahead and planning several moves in advance is required to win the game. It does get a little tedious. Still, it is a good abstract game and I am not a huge fan of abstracts.

RATING: 7
I think this is the most devious of the GIPF series, and possibly the most creative - it's certainly a stellar game. However, I also think it has two notable drawbacks for general play. 

But the good, first... this is essentially a puzzle-solving game where you must find a way to solve a puzzle or else tweak the puzzle and hand it back to your opponent. However, each added piece generally makes the puzzle easier to solve, so you don't want to miss opportunities. The solutions to the puzzles turn around the game's theme of "Sacrifice" - you give up a piece to force your opponent into giving you something better. While all the GIPF games are brain-burny in their own ways, Zertz especially turns your brain inside-out and is incredibly cool. While I'm not the most experienced abstract player, I've never seen anything else like this.

However, I do think there are two important consequences of the game's design that make this game less suitable for many players than its short playing time and general coolness suggest. First off, it's possibly the most newbie-unfriendly game I've ever played. Not only is it deep and tricky, but since you win by forcing moves on the opponent, a newbie getting thrashed will likely make no more than one or two moves of his volition in the whole game. It's very not fun to lose at this game. Second, this unfun-ness is compounded by the fact that you have little to think about when it's not your turn. You can't really "look ahead" at the board in the way you might with Chess. You just need to wait for your opponent. This is likewise unfun for many. Neither of these issues are "flaws", exactly. They're just necessary consequences of the game's fundamental idea.

Overall, I'm still enthralled with this game's coolness after owning and playing it off and on for a year or two. It's great, fiendish, and unique. But it's not the kind of game you whip out after dinner with houseguests or use as a 15 minute filler with people who aren't devoted to it. You want to play Zertz with people who appreciate a good abstract and who are willing and able to play it regularly enough to learn it and stick with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great puzzle-style game. Playing with 61 rings makes it especially challenging as you expect to have to bring your own marbles back into play which makes for difficult choices. The successful setting up of a (complex) trap for your opponent is key to success. Very unforgiving when making a mistake.

This game really intrigues me, and I'd like to explore it more (I've only played once or twice if I recall correctly). It is very much about puzzle-like look ahead and seems to lack any intuitive lever to grab a hold of out the gates. To really get a foothold on this game I think you have to study it, which there ARE resources online for that (I've browsed them).

RATING: N/A
In this third addition to the GIPF Project players compete to acquire sets of multi-colored balls. This is mostly accomplished by jumping one ball over one or more others, Checkers-style, on a hex board. A player's turn consists of either jumping (which can be forced) or placing any color ball on the board and removing an empty space from the edge of the board. In this manner, the play space continually shrinks, giving the endgame an almost claustrophobic feel. This game is part of project GIPF.

Has a bit of a learning curve, in that the strategy necessary to capture specific marbles requires some backwards thinking.  Can see why this is as popular as it is.  Looking forward to further playings.

Gorgeous, as is the rest of the series. And again, pure genius; Burm is from another planet.

Really more of an interactive puzzle in most ways than a traditional game (though that 'definition' could be stretched to fit a lot of games).  Deep and interesting, but without feeling too heavy.  Unlike so many 'heavy' abstracts, this is easy to learn and get into, and even play reasonably well.  But there is still that learning curve, and with the customizable board, this should have tremendous longevity.

I would rate this below Dvonn, Tzar, and Yinsh, but it is a good game.

Lacks the tension of Dvonn. I feel like I'm setting traps rather than pouncing.

I think I like Yinsh better, but this is pretty cool.

I liked everything about this game except the occasional forced jump where I had not choices about how to move.  If I had this in the house I doubt I'd ever play checkers again...

I love this game!  Clever, brain-burning goodness for two people in 15-20 minutes.  My Dad and I usually play a best-of-three when we play. :)  Update: I've dropped this half a point.  I think I like YINSH the best out of the series now.  The way the rings move unleashes creativity out of the most stolid of players.

A fantastic abstract strategy (or at least deeply tactical) game. I love how very simple moves can bring about complicated results.

Very indirect abstract.  I find it hard to come up with much strategy in this game and mostly end up reacting.

Fun abstract. The shrinking board is a really nice idea and the pieces look fantastic.

Brilliant abstract strategy game, which operates off checkers'/draughts' strategic linchpin of forced captures.  Since the strategy is significantly deeper than with checkers, much clever planning is required; and in order to excel at ZÈRTZ, you must be able to analyze the current situation and derive numerous branches of future possibilities from it, as with any moderately deep, purely strategic game.  Brilliant stuff, though.

Great game for those who enjoy other strategy/puzzle type games such as Chess and Connect Four.  A very nice mechanism, and much like Go, you and your opponent need to utilize the same spaces.

After 2+ Plays: Fun Abstract.  After a couple plays I feel like I'm starting to get the hang of it.

After 10+ Plays: Scratch that, I still haven't gotten the hang of this.  I don't really like the lack of differentiation between the players.

The components are great and the game mechanics quite ingenious. Takes some playing before you get any hang of the strategies, though...

More about setting up your opponent than anything else, which isn't my favorite thing in the world. Still, a smart design.

11/18/04 - have only played this and DVONN.  I prefer Zertz.  This game is a breath of fresh air in the land of German-minded boardgaming.  UPDATE 11/30/04 - Have now tried Gipf.  Not sure which I prefer.  UPDATE 2-23-5:  One day I woke up and didn't like Zertz as much as I used to.  I don't know why.

Really solid card action selection/set collection game.  You have to collect sets of tool icons that match one of the 5 portal cards and then have the correct action card to close the portal.  Bonus points are awarded for collecting matching portal types and/or 5 unique portals.

Solo mode is great and a good challenge.  Plays in around 30 minutes so works great as a quick filler.

This is a poor design. Too boring and too much luck in the cards you draw, which has a big impact on the gameplay. If you cannot get away from your position as you don't draw the correct cards etc., it can be tough. Don't want to play this one again.

RATING: 6
A neat game-play concept and use of cards.  The multiple use cards with a movement mechanism adds an element that gives the game an almost puzzle-like feel but not in a bad way where it seems you have a logical option and have to do that.

So much can happen between turns which could prevent long-term planning, and while it is perfectly playable with 4 players and it rarely feels like you have no options, it is far harder to plot to block the future moves of other players.  I have a feeling the game would have better control and more strategic game play with 2-3 players than a higher player count.

I like the card mechanic here whereby every action is available but each action requires you to be on a certain colour. It can be a little frustrating if for example you want to move and the move action doesn't appear on the colour you are stood on however there are lots of options to cycle your hand either drawing additional cards or simply grabbing required cards out of the discard pile.

 I also like the dual use of the cards as sometimes you have the tough decision of whether to play the card as a tool which will allow you to close portals or at actually play it for its action.

Theme is unique and the artwork is good, I really like the gummy bear world :)
Interesting and fairly fast little filler card game which is very easy to just pick up and play

Nem valami jól sikerült darab. Az akciók felének semmi értelme nincs, így viszont nagyon sok múlik azon, hogy miket húzol. Ha ezt még nem is vesszük, akkor is nagyon problémásnak érzem, hogy ha nem húzol mozgást, akkor gyakorlatilag nincs min gondolkodni a körödben, mert kb 3 lehetőség közül kell döntened, de ha meg húzol, akkor hirtelen ez a 3 lehetőség 3 millió lesz, amit meg már képtelenség végiggondolni. Ez így nagyon aránytalan. Kár érte, mert mind az alapmechinka, mind a téma, design nagyon tetszett.

Przyjemna karcianka o bardzo ładnych grafikach. Prostsza niż by się wydawało na pierwszy rzut oka, ale to na plus. Dobrze działa na 2 osoby, zwykle wyniki są dosyć zbliżone i idzie się łeb w łeb. Trochę negatywnej interakcji, ale aż tak nie boli. Sporo możliwości kontroli dzięki funkcji przywracania kart ze stosu odrzuconych. Gracze z reguły idą łeb w łeb, trochę sobie poprzeszkadzają, ale końcowy wynik będzie głownie zależał od wartości zamkniętych portali.

Szalony naukowiec zbudował reaktory które po włączeniu otwierają przejścia do dziwnych i niebezpiecznych światów. Trzeba skacząc z jednego do drugiego zbierać karty których można użyć do zamykania reaktorów (odpowiedni zestaw surowców) lub do aktywacji zdolności pozwalających skakać lub zbierać jeszcze więcej kart. Wbrew opisowi i bardzo ładnym grafikom, gra sucha jak pieprz, dosyć ciekawa ale jakaś taka nudna (przynajmniej solo). Michał Oracz tu chyba też maczał palce (i może to uratowało tę grę).

A gorgeous looking and puzzly little drafting/set collection/pick-up-and-deliver game. For some reason it kind of reminds me of AquaSphere, albeit a very light and streamlined version of it. It's probably nothing like it, but they're siblings in spirit.

Maybe it's because of the double-actions: the card your pawn is in has its own action, which you trigger with the right kind of cards in your hand, but the cards in your hand also have different actions. I'll have to play more to tell whether it's just ok or a keeper.

RATING: 9
I love games where the control is firmly with the players, (and where there is a rich variety of options on what to do each turn), and one's fate is not at the mercy of 'luck of draw'. Each card is a different permutation of the same five actions, for the five locations! Every achievement feels like a true accomplishment and puzzle solution, as if playing Zelda. This heavy filler achieves a lot with a perfect balance of new and familiar mechanics. Stunningly beautiful esthetics. Far more satisfying than games like Splendor, and more opportunity for screwage than Discoveries. This is almost like Innovation/Impulse-lite, but plays faster.

(My review is the original when i rated the game a 3, an edit at the bottom explains the change)

I'll start with the components. Frankly, they're superb. The box is a great size and the insert is perfect for storing all the components when opened. The art on the cards is great and the card stock is excellent too, a very nice feel from all the components. Really can't fault the production quality in the slightest. 

The rules insert is good and explains the game very well. Setup and packup time are both very quick, and it is very easy to explain to others. The scoring mechanism is very well thought out, and allows seperate ways to generate bonus points and give players things to watch out against others for. All great so far!

But now, I have to go to my problem with the game - the gameplay. From knowing the game designer, I was excited by his vision for the game. He starts with the question "What if there were no bad cards?". Having played many games with him and having been the victim of bad draws in card games, I sympathised and looked forward to his solution. The solution is to have 5 actions, with all of them available on every card in a different configuration - where 1 is available depending on what location you are on. Sounds good - but it actually didn't fix the problem of "no bad cards", it's still exactly the problem. In fact, with only 3 cards in your hand - having "bad cards" can (and did) become a worse problem in this game than in many card games I've played before.

With 3 actions a turn, my girlfriend accused me of not trying to play properly as I spent consecutive turns just doing discard/draw as my action every time. I started to play with my hand showing, and I showed her that turn after turn I wasn't getting either the move or recycle card that I needed to actually be able to do anything in the game. Turn after turn I was stuck, until the game was finally over. "Maybe it was just bad luck" I thought - and we played another game. This time a 4 player game with 2 other friends. In the end, I experienced the exact same problem while one of the other players complained of the exact same thing. This made me feel a little better, as it wasn't just me that thought the game can really screw you.

So I feel the game needs something to help when you get stuck in a position like this. Maybe you can discard any 3 cards and spend all 3 actions to take any card action in game? You'll always start your turn in this position, so it will always be an option. It's so frustrating when you get stuck in a game and you have no way to break out of it. So I really have no choice except to give this game a low score.

1/Feb/2017 Edit - After chatting to the designer, he told me about the change in the Cthulhu expansion that he hoped would address my issues. We played with the new rules and, I have to say that, they play better than any of the suggestions that I made. This goes from my old rating of 3 up to a much better 7. While it's not a game I'd base a night of game playing around (a bit lightweight for me) - it's certainly one I throw into the bag, as it's a great shorter game and also one that's good to play with newer players. A very solid game!

„Multiuniversum”, czyli atak wściekłych żelek i nie tylko.

Plusy:
1.	Grafiki
2.	Mechanika
3.	Proste zasady
4.	Interakcja
5.	Skalowalność
6.	Wariant solo
7.	Cena
8.	System punktacji

Minusy:
1.	Cienkie karty

  „Multiuniversum” to świetna karcianka o genialnej tematyce, klimacie i z dobrym delikatnym humorem. Rozgrywka wymaga główkowania, bo jest kilka sposobów na zdobywanie punktów. Gra się świetnie we 2, 3, 4 osoby (w piątkę nie grałem, ale też zapewne jest podobnie) a wariant solo też jest super. Tytuł ten sprawdza się nie tylko jako czekadełko, ale może być konkretnym tytułem na wieczór (2-3 godziny można przy niej spędzić). „Multiuniversum” to genialna gra, polecam 8/10

It plays fast and is reasonably interesting, but I am not sure I like the Transformer card abilities, especially Red and Blue, as it allows one to be a jerk and frustrate other players.

Sold at DunDraCon 2017.

Geek hq. Crunchy filler, lots of options each turn, great graphics and theme, lots to like here. 1-5 40 min or less.

Seal the portals on each transformer at CERN. Well balanced 5 player game.

Bought it (and the playmat, and the expansion) after a demo game with the designer in Essen. Even though the gameplay does not feel entirely original, the game has the perfect length and footprint for the amount of depth it offers. It is highly portable, the artwork is great and the cardplay presents a nice optimization puzzle. Looking forward to trying out the Cthulhu expansion!

Just played my first game of (solo) multiuniversum. Really enjoyed it. Wasn't sure the solo rules were fair until I started using tactics and transformer abilities to sabotage the virtual players plans. I've added the Cthulhu expansion cards to the main box and kept the packaging for these underneath the tray for posterity. Using the play mat just feels very cool.

Glad I backed. Let us know if there are more expansions on the way please.

I love the multi use cards and basic game layout. The art is beautiful but slightly to morbid/dark for the weight of the game so I don't feel I can pull it out with people new to the hobby to O lowered its rating.

Started reading the rules and thought it was going to suck. It was actually pretty enjoyable and what looks daunting with all the iconography is actually really simple. 

The solo mode works well but I suspect multiplayer will be more fun just for the social aspect of stealing portal closures from under each others noses.

Set collecting card game puzzle. Close the portals between earth and the many alternate realities within the multi universe else we become overrun by crazy eye-bats, evil toys, killer blobs, gummy warriors, mega bugs, and the like.  Action point system to collect multi-use cards used to place the set of tools that match the portal and then activate the close portal action to close it. Victory points for collecting of-a-kind and unique sets of portal symbols.  Distinctive game play digging for the right combination tools and the frustration (in a good way) of having the right actions available that correspond to the lab from where you are working.  The lab special powers (e.g. Shuffling or rearranging portals) and action choices have a fresh quality that create unexpected interactive situations so that it is not multiuniversum-solitaire.

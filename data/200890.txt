This game is mean worker placement game, with plenty of tactics.

We didn't mind the concept of losing points every turn, in fact we found it quit amusing.

The inclusion of an area that allows you to repeat an already taken action is a nice touch, especially because it only takes one action disk. You can lose points for using this space, but the advantages can be worth it.

This space also causes lots of tension when players are competing for first place, basically the player with the last token to place in a round can steal first player, often playing less honey for the move.

Prototype is al bijzonder mooi gemaakt.
Pixies (ontdeugende elfjes) stelen voedingswaren in de dorpen, en offeren deze dan aan de veeleisende koningin.  Wie niet voldoet aan haar grillen, krijgt zweepslagen (strafpunten).
Zeer goede wp, mooi concept, mooie prenten, mooi verhaal.
Zeer veel verschillende acties mogelijk, maar de prenten maken het allemaal zeer helder, en het spel speelt m.i. heel vlot.
IK MOET DAT HEBBEN :-)

Nice amount of interaction and decisons to keep the game flowing for the most part. 

In our first 4 player game, most of us maxed out on the silver/gold tracks by round 5 to reduce our penalties (Aim 1: preserve points). ...AND, we played that wrong as we moved up as many gold/silver we offered, not 1 or 2 steps only!!

All the forge a "Golden ring" bonuses were gone (Aim 2: gather end game bonus). This meant, the game was almost totally focused on gaining the once per round "Special Offer" and "Loyal Servant" bonus tiles. There are no other ways to get points, other than making others lose some. 

The last round players in 3rd/4th position didn't have much to do other than throwing resources out to avoid 3 point penalties if a majority was likely. The player in 1st/2nd positoin tried to have enough food to promote a pixie to loyal status (the 1st player was 1 resource short to do so, which was hilarious!). Some demotion and whipping happend too, but it was more to have something to do, rather than going for a strategy.

We enjoyed ourselves and I'm happy I backed it. However, I'm not sure how much the limitations of the end game will impact on the longevity of the game on my shelf. For a first game of a first time publisher, it's quite a good start!

Played this at a local game fair where Rudy had one table to demo the game. Explanation was excelent by Rudy. Not all the final pieces where up for display, just generic cubes, but all the artwork was finished and it looked great. Certainly an eyecatcher.

It's a well designed worker placement game where you have to recover from a negative scoring, something Mea Culpa also has. It felt thouroughly playtested, unlike some other games from small publishers.

I didn't choose to back this on Kickstarter because it lacked a real wow, or novelty factor for me. You have to like the 'take that' element of worker placement mechanic. Also, players hide their resources and use them in a blind bidding, which can really give a player an advantage when it goes uncontested for a certain resource. Probably the part I liked the least.

Wouldn't mind playing it again, at all, but I have a healthy share of WP games in my cabinet already.

#Kickstarter This game is cartoonish, mean and surreal. A proud memebr of it's Belgian heritage which has to be taken "Deuxieme degrée".

Under the cartoon shell although a mean and solid Euro heart beats and gives you a game that is rich, complex and unforgiving.

If you like efficiency and backstabbing this game is for you. I like it a lot so far

High quality components, even for the cardboard pieces.  The game looks more daunting than it plays.   Includes plenty of plastic bags to organize pieces to your liking.  Edition purchased included full color manuals in English, Dutch, German, and French. 

Purchased at SpellenSpektakel 2017, at the prodding/recommendation of the game’s designer Rudy Seuntjens.

Quite impressive. It has a lot of rules to get through initially (there are about 20 actions or something), but once you do, there is a pretty deep and deeply pretty game here. Lots of options, but importantly lots and lots of options to block or mess with other players. This all plays into the central theme where you are all servants of the queen and most of the time you just get whipped.

2017-11-26 : First play. This is in essence a worker placement / engine building game with rather high take-that and luck elements. I'm not a fan of games where careful planning can be outdone that way, but it certainly is well-designed. The only really negative thing is again that bane of many high-flavour games : using dark colours in combination with a linnen finish that are a pain in the butt to actually play when the lighting isn't totally optimal. I'm sure it all looked very nice on the graphic's guy's 30 inch monitor, but for Zeus' sake somebody smack all those artists against the head and make them look at the literally hundreds of examples of how crappy that looks when actually printed and looking at it from over half a meter away.

It's an ok worker placement with a great theme and very nice artwork.
There are, however, better worker placements out there.
In this worker placement, it's easier to disrupt another player then in most worker placements and this can be a deal maker or breaker.
It does give a certain dimension to the game other games don't have, so maybe someone else IS looking for a game like this... but it just isn't my full cup of tea.

I played a few rounds of this worker placement game on the Brussels Games Festival and really liked the artwork and background story. There are many different actions to be taken and it seems they interlink nicely. This game will launch on Kickstarter soon and is definitely worth it to be checked out.

RATING: 8.6
(Kickstarter starting September 9th.)

This is an euro game, in the classical sense of the word.  It follows the school of design of such action selection/worker placement classics as Puerto Rico, Caylus or Tzolkin.  An element of this is that the game focuses on gameplay, and it's accompagnying strategies and tactics instead of miniatures, conflict and narration.

However, this doesn't mean that there's no attention to theme and artwork here. Careful attention has been given to artwork, a new and novel theme, and making sure that gameplay feels like "being tyranized by a queen that's never satisfied, and at the same time being bothered by those other pixies".

Gameplay follows the tried-and-true "pick an action and hope your opponents also wanted that action" system of the action selection/worker placement genre.

The game does however uses some novel approaches to this system:  Because of the many options, and the fact that you can "duplicate" once per turn (at a cost, though) there's less pressure if there's an action taken you desperately wanted.  This doesn't mean there's less tension overall, since there are a few "take that" actions, like stealing resources, giving negative points, switching abilities, bluffing, if-i-don't-cooperate-we'll-all-get-punished, ...  Nothing that would eliminate your chances of winning, but it surely reinforces the theme of pixies (your fellow players in this case) being a pain in the ass.

It's a nice game, beautifully designed.
I found it rather complex though. I spend about 3 hours trying to understand how to play it (quite a lot for me), that helped when playing though.
It is interesting and gives a lot of choices, maybe a little too much choice for a first play.
I doubt I will play it frequently enough to remember all the rules & details without having to reread the rules every time though.

While I like the theme, my main problem with this game is how useless your actions feel. Placing your pixies on stealing spots doesn't really help you that much, as you need to get rid of resources in the end, and there aren't that many ways to do that. Sure, you will need some food for the special offers and getting your pixies in the castle, but the food tiles are almost enough for that.

Prototype play - Pixie Queen is a slightly mischievous worker placement game, starting with the theme and continuing with the action choices. Some of the actions target other players. Resources can be stolen, opponent's pixies can be relegated, even negative points can be given to players. The malicious theme is supported by the author's choice that during the game players only gather whippings, i.e. negative points. 

The game itself is a race for three types of rewards gained for gifting resources to the Queen, becoming a favourite by progressing pixies on the board and gathering enough gold to buy gold rings for the Queen. At game end, the rewards are tallied with the accumulated whippings. Twenty-one worker placement spots offer choices. Unless players have improved an action with one of their pixies, most actions need two of the four action pawns to be activated. Special skills, a demand mechanism with a blind bidding element and the competition for being early in turn order complete the game.

While I was worried about the targeted negative interactions, they were limited due to the scarcity of actions. Often, positive actions will yield the same or better results. This might be different with the full complement of five players. Pixie Queen is open enough for a few different strategies. I won by reducing the negative points gathered per round, mostly ignoring the Pixie board play at first and focusing on gold production instead. But this only works out if other players will let you do it. It's not a multiplayer solitaire, variation in the game will come through different players interacting.

Pixie Queen is a solid game and accomplishes what it sets out to do. In so far, it's above average as far as first-time Kickstarter efforts are concerned. A few rough edges could have been polished with some external development but they don't disturb the gameplay. Probably a recommendation for fans of independent Kickstarter games.

played it once in a group of 4, lost horribly. Takes about 2-3 hours. Actions feel quite disconnected and it's quite tight. It's a few races together: 
- race your pixies out of the mines and into the village to the top and get points
- race your silver and gold to actually earn VP instead of getting whipped
- race your extra offerings (increasing with your extra donations) to get vp
- race your gold to get rings.
It's quite an experience actually. Some situations you want much of some type, at the end you want none of that.
The only thing that I didn't understand was the thing with the player order.

RATING: N/A
These are some thoughts after watching nox videos twice and reading all comments so far. 

Some of them are overly positive I am afraid. comparing it to puerto rico, tzolkin and le havre.... Nox gave a honest review rating it three stars. 
I value his reviews more than these of  overly positive reviewers. And since it is three stars I will read the rules to see If I will back it.

The prototype looks good but is not amazing. No need to really for me.,I am a big fan of winsome...I fail to see what they would change to make it look great.mUpgrading the resources  a la imperial settlers is a possibility.


The mechanics are okay. the rounds follow a fixed structure that limits your options. On the plus side this makes it easy to play and limits AP.

From the review of nox which I watched twice in great detail I gather that this is sort of a race worker placement were jockeying for positions and timing is key to do well. 

i don't know which permanent powers are available that are picked at the start of the game in reverse turn order. I hope these permanent powers are rather small. 
I am nog a big fan of these powers in worker placement games. Because most of the time it forces you even more to follow a certain path. Limiting your options even more.
I do like them in chaos in the old world though....

What concerns me the most is that playtime is 60-120 minutes. Does this mean the game with 2 players has as many rounds as the game with five players?
I can't see the number of action discs changing depending on the number of players.
I would think that playing with more players means you have more single action spaces available that are helpfull to you meaning that you need less rounds.


I am impressed that the designer started his own company to publish this game. And wish him all the best. He made huge efforts to be present in a lot of local events and I applaud his enthusiasm.

Meanwhile played it for the 3th time ... it's getting better with each time I play it.
Yesterday played it with 5 people. We started off at approx. 20.30hrs and the game ended approx. at 22.30hrs. So for playing with 5, it was a quick and smooth game. Allthough there was a lot of tiny frustrations during the game (about someone taking some else's action) there was not really much downtime.
With the  group I played it, I had a really nice time and would be enjoying to play it again.
Where will it end? Buying the game, possibly ... my wife haven't played it yet.


First play ... so not a definite number.
But I'm not convinced to back it on kickstarter. I just can't point out for the moment what it is.
Maybe it is the few actions you can do ... I don't know. I had, during the game, always the feeling I couldn't do enough.

+++ The artwork. This is really beautifully done, a real eyecatcher.
++ I like the mechanism on how the offering works: the Queen ask a certain types of food, but you can bit with silver and gold (which you really want to do), but if nobody offers the demanded food, nobody gets something.
+- It's in fact a negative game: the player with the least minus points will. It's already a sign that the VP-track goes from -60 until +20 :s
--The Queen already punishes enough in my opinion. There is absolutely no need for spots like stealing food and certainly not the one that makes a dice roll makes a player of your chose lose 1 - 3 VP. That's purely 1player sacrificing an action marker to bully an other player. Maybe thematically that feels correct, game mechanically wise this just feels bad, being a eurogamer who likes to built up an engine

The mechanics of the game are simple but the game play is complex.  It is tough to focus on one direction or another.  The Pixie Queen punishes everyone's pixies severely.  It is easy to gather resources but hard to gain the Queen's favour.  Negative points are easily earned and protecting yourself from the Queen's wrath is paramount.  A fun game with great mechanics.

Brilliant! Nice artwork. Like the concept and the setting of this excellent worker-placement game with a twist.

RATING: 7
This game uses a couple of mechanics that I usually do not like in a game with this length and this amount of rules: blind bidding, take that and guessing. In addition, the amount of negative points that you acquire each round feels quite depressing. Still, with more than two players (it really does not work with that player count) the game manages to entertain with a lot of turn angst. Together with the wonderful components (love the artwork), that 's what saved it for me. But I can certainly understand why part of our group was not as enamoured with it as I was, because of its punishing nature. All in all a good game, but not one that I want to play regularly.

Our second game of the night; 'Pixie Queen' had less to do with the Fey and nothing at all to do with Freddie Mercury, and is themed around the highly mischevious and whimsical nature of the aforementioned forerunners of the elves.... When the blurb states the game is based on the worker placement mechanic, it doesn't inspire great confidence in it being fun, reflecting my dislike of many of these games that seem to have themes as exciting as watching paint dry. 
Thankfully, this game is nothing like that, but I'd suggest game designers avoid having this phrase prominent in any marketing literature as it must put off as many as it attracts. But enough of my warblings, what is the game like and will it rock your world? Players take the role of a pixie master who wants to find favour with his queen, but like most monarchs, she is capricious and hard to please, making demands for gifts at the drop of a hat or any other object of choice. 

The blurb goes on to reference that many pixies frequented Cornwall and Devon in this country and allows them options of bullying, spanking, stealing and torturing to achieve their desires. The pixie master is trying to get as many of his bretheren from the mines and to ascend into the pixie queen's castle to prevent there ensnarement and to assist in getting resources to placate the vagaries of the pixie queen, There are a number of ascending options as they go on this journey. 

One option they can take is to draw mineral resources from a closed cloth bag - consisting of coal, gold and silver - although there are counters that can allow two to be drawn directly from the bag. All resources so drawn must be revealed to the other (rivals) players. Others include reversing conters drawn from the board and/or other players, replicating an action of another player, as well as the spanking action. I kid you not. there is a dice for it and everything. 

The spanking that goes on in the kingdom of the pixies is not often written about but is intended to penalise your rivals by making them lose face in the eyes of the pixie queen. Victory in this game is determined by the player with the fewest points since the only points earned or avoided during the game are penalty points. Reward points are only collected at the end of a game so accumulating 'spankings' during the course of the game can be quite degrading to this end. Some pixies seemd to enjoy the spanking more than others. 

Bribery and corruption are the order of the day and the game does create the atmosphere of an imaginary struggle between the pixie masters as they can offer gold rings and earn bonuses (spankings probably!) Receive sufficient penalties, and one or more pixies seeking a way into the pixie queen's castle may be returned to their mines,reducing the options on resource collection. Obtaining each reward demands completely different game tactics so the game offers a great deal for the mega-strategists amongst us.
 
A point worth remembering is that you need to get resources from the get-go, via an action available on the board, which I did not as I wanted to wait for a better one, which was then taken by one of the pixie masters. I could have taken the lower one and then replaced it later, or replicated an action, but it was quite late on in the game when I did this so I will not make the same mistake again. this fateful decision is reflected in the final points tally attaching to my BBG entry. It was pretty bad but the spankings made up for it! 

The game consists of a maximum of seven rounds with five phases each in which pixie masters may steal food (honey, apples, bread) in Truro, the nearest human village. No mention was made of this in our game which would have helped set the scene better and I often think explanations need to include little scene setters such as this. The rules were explained well enough although there is a lot to take in at first. There are a few other options to mention before we come to the end of this little party. 

Players may also perform actions using their four disks, so as to maximize their profits and gain more goods. There is a choice of no less than twenty-one different actions. For most of these, two action disks are needed unless you can enlist the help of a pixie, previously released and not necessarily of your own bretheren (colour). The bidding mechanism relates to the need to offer the pixie queen's most craved for item. Failing to do so results in a spanking. There are several tracks for gold and silver that it is wise to progress along as well. 

Make sure you get rid of as many of your resources as you can at the end of the game, otherwise more penalty points, and potentially, more spankings. I don't know how many times I've mentioned spankings, but it must be quite a few. A good game that grew on me as we progressed through the paths to glory.

Un bon jeu de placement d'ouvriers servi par un thème original et bien utilisé. 
Bonne profondeur stratégique, des choix tactiques omniprésents et de l'interaction méchante permanente qui donne une ambiance très particulière malgré le côté brise neurone parfois prenant.
Seul point négatif : la lisibilité du plateau, qui est superbe mais qui manque de clarté sur les premières parties.
Par contre, éviter les joueur paralysis analysis qui peuvent facilement ruiner toute la fluidité du gameplay tant les options sont nombreuses à chaque tour.

Worker placement game with a "punishing" twist and some "take that".

We bought this at "Spel 2017" in Antwerp.

the game clearly has its weaknesses
it can be frustrating due to the dice and sometimes it takes very long
a few rules and scenarios also seem simply out of place
but if you like coop games and the zombies are at least ok for you, then you can definitely have a lot of fun here
especially if you have no problem to make your house rules, nothing really speaks against the purchase

i personally prefer Season 3, because the missions are better designed

An exciting miniatures game with top-notch visuals and components. The game is easy to pick-up and teach to others, albeit a few things not covered in the rulebook and some other minor details. The game is challenging in its own right.

Backed the Kickstarter.
Just like the first in game play, but with some new type of Zombie.
These ones cannot be the target of range attack, so close combat becomes a must. (chainsaw all the way)
I did find the prison doors to be annoying and I'm glad that I purchased the 3d doors it'll help my game play in the future.

Had a couple of experiences with this one and i would say that the more players the better. 

You and your friends are survivors of a zombie apocalypse and each mission is another chapter in your struggle for survival.
Each turn your character gets 2 actions (More when you level up or if your characters abilities allow it) which are usually move, combat or search. then the zombie get a turn to shuffle a space closer to you, when you crack open a door zombies spawn, and at the end of each turn zombies spawn at designated spawn spots.

It's quite a good game for an afternnon with some friends where you don't want to be competitive or deal with the heavier weight of Eldritch Horror, maybe even with a beer or 3. Each game does fall into this sort of formula: Spend 2 turns tooling up, single-mindedly go after objectives moving and shootig as you go, then mop up.
I would recommend completely ignoring the rule that allows you to turn into a zombie upon death, all it does is make the game impossible to lose.

I like the new type of Zombie, the berserkers. It really makes the game more puzzley - especially when combined with the toxic zombies. Otherwise, good looking tiles and good human mini's.

Even better than Season 1. The tiles are better detailed, more varied, and have more playing zones each. 
The equipment deck feels stronger, but somehow more adapted to new zombie types the season 2 introduce. 
Only survivors feel somehow less charismatic than season one's.

A really tasty experience.

RATING: 9.55
Very fun amerithrash game. Mini's are awesome. I enjoy figuring out how to complete the different scenarios. They are challenging. Usually takes multiple play throughs to beat a scenario. I don't like the shooting mechanic. Will likely adopt the shooting rule from Black Plague. PROS: minis, killing zombies, getting gear. CONS: characters don't stay leveled up between scenarios, shooting combat mechanic, no real story element.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
Ya, the ranged attack rules are odd.  And maybe cars and molotovs are imbalanced.  But this game isn't about balance--it's about being a pliable, zombie playground.  A place where you can house-rule and role play to your heart's content.

Loved playing this 2p with gf.  Controlling multiple characters made the game much more interesting--I don't think I'd have liked it nearly as much at higher player counts (certainly not above 3.)

RATING: 3
A lot of the scenarios are broken. I most cases you can lock yourself in, gather the best weapons, open the door and kill all zombies with a molotov. 

Some players out there say: "Do not play it that way." We say: "The designers should have takten care of that that it is NOT POSSIBLE to play it that way.

The beserker zombies and weapons are worth the purchase, but the package as an out-of-the-box-experience is disappointing and it feels that GG or CMON did not playtest that game very much.

In a nutshell: Prison Outbreak does not work very well without houserules. And that is a shame for a 2,4 million $ project...

RATING: 7
More of the same: I’m so fed up with the cooperative dungeon crawls that I can’t stand them anymore.

Yet playing Zombicide with a different group (way friendlier and less competitive than the previous run’s) made Prison Outbreak a better game than the original chapter or, I should say, «Season» looked like: but, I guess, it’s just a case of a better socialization, since the way both «Seasons» play feels exactly the same.

Thus I rate this Prison Outbreak the same as the original game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The only thing I don;t like about this game is that the map Tiles are a bit hard to digest...  The rule book was immediately re-released after it printed due to errors on the maps (a testament to how busy they are)

Having said all that...   I love Zombicide.  The Survivors have had a little power creep from the season 1 guys, but thats cool,  shuffling in all the cards will also increase the difficulty accordingly!

The only reason I didn't rate this as a 9 is because The Maps are a bit bunko (as mentioned above) and so as a Stand Alone, it's a 8.   However, It's really an expansion to Zombicide, so I won't rate it here

More zombicide! What's not to love? Well... the rulebook missions are a bit wonky. Prison Outbreak works well enough on it's own, although I need to find some more missions for it. The characters are fun, and for some reason some of the items feel more powerful than those in the base game.

The new Zombies are too heavy. Surely a good game idea, simple rules and fun to Play. Nice miniatures but Cards are much to small and your Player board is quickly a mass.

RATING: 9.5
Ok!  So I have gotten to play through a couple missions now and while I have only played with 1 or 2 others having 2 characters I have really enjoyed this...kind of wish I played it more when I wasn't kinda tired.  

Ok back to my actual thoughts on the game.  

Love it!  What a great game.  As the action picks up you really can get overwhelmed by zombie hoards.  Such a fantastic game.  The game is pretty simple in actions you can take but there are a lot of "cans and cannots".  Once you teach it to your core group of people there is little downtime between turns and the downtime I did have I used to help take zombies off or put them on or think about what my next move might be.

If you have the money to spare and you like co-op games buy it!  Even if you dont like zombies or the zombie theme (I'm not at all into zombies but I liked the overall gameplay), buy it!

I so want to really enjoy these kinds of games because they look so cool and cost so much, hahaha! I would put it on the same level as Zombies!!!, HeroClix, Doom, Krosmaster Arena, and even Star Wars X-Wing. They usually have great graphics and a lot of action. The rule books are always way too long, LOL. Of all of them I think Zombies!!! is the easiest and yet also the most fun. I will have to give this one another try with more people. Really, I just played the easiest lay out by myself and found it way too easy. As though I feel I'm doing something wrong. I wish my son Loved These more, but I think the rule books are too intimidating for him and his friends. Maybe someday. This is a keeper, but not something I think I would play very often.

Compared to the original:

- Some maps in the rulebook are aweful, not that they are hard but more that there is missing indications on the map or some stuffs are really unclear.
- Some new weapons makes the game a bit easier. I like survival games to be hard.

Good enough tense tactic game. There are some rules that feel not very thematic or real (like applying more difficult card results when any player has killed a count of zombies), but it is there for a good reason (trying to balance protagonism between all players).

It has a high luck factor, but is very fast and tense, so you can enter the game mood very fast. I don't see too much replayability. Decisions seems very basic after first play. Perhaps other scenarios can be more flexible and durable.

A generally fun co-op, though I believe that Pandemic and Space Alert are better options.  

The rules for this game are surprisingly long, and the noise rules are fiddly and should just generally be ignored unless it's clear that they would alter an outcome.  The game itself is also long.

Second stand alone game in the Zombicide series that is set in a prison.  The game comes with 6 new survivors and their zombivor counterparts, 9 double sided tiles, and equipment/wound cards.  Other than some different vehicle tiles and some equipment cards more appropriate to the prison setting (riot shields, nightsticks, etc), this game's biggest addition is the introduction of the Berserker zombie type.  The Berserker zombies come in walker/runner/fatty/abomination form and are immune to all ranged attacks.  The Berserker abomination can also move 2 spaces.  Same rating as the base game.

Going the "all in" stretch with the second season... including now what I have missed till now: 
Season 1 + Season 2 PO and TCM + all stretches at USD 220 level + some choosen goodies for around USD 350 till now! ;-)

Received Prison Outbreak + Prison Outbreak Pack A

Rating for this second base game is lower because of the included tiles-set! It's good to have these "themed" tiles for this "prison" edition but the first base set tiles (city-tiles) are more visually and flexible, you should have both available for the best experience!

This game is nice for many aspects but there is a big mistake on playing time.
Prepare yourself for sometime more than 5 hours to beat a mission and hope for a player to not die in the middle.

Also 6 players = some players will fall asleep because of a long turn
2 players = 3 characters to manage per player... not fun

Berserker zombies are such a pain in the elbow!
so hard to beat!

After one play, I really liked some of the stuff that was added in the game. I still have to try companion dogs, zombie dogz and a few more scenarios.

I feared the game would become easier after having more zombies to spawn, but this just got a lot harder!

More zombie madness!  Adds Berserk zombies that can only be killed by melee.  Nasty.  The only negative so far is that all of the scenarios are big and require 6+ heroes which means most of the time you end up playing multiple heros.  I liked the mix better in the base game of scenario sizes.

Yes, the medieval version of Zombicide has better rules. But, for me, this is the closest board game experience I'll get to the zombie hoard moments from walking dead. Dead of Winter is a better thematic game, but Zombicide will give you the more tense single sortie moments of the zombie experience.

Spent 4 hours playing my first game.  Everyone else started with a gun, but I started with a hammer.  During the fist three hours I got to kill 1 zombie and flip 1 switch.  Otherwise I was just searching every turn.  I did find a revolver which we needed to kill the abominations, but someone else had a Molotov and killed the 2 on the board before I even had a chance.  Overall, it was 4 hours of boredom.

Unlike Last Night On Earth, this feels like a zombie horde.  Dozens upon dozens of zombies on the board.

Cars are a way overpowered, but since this is a cooperative, I don't mind that much.  Scenarios which have a car in them (about 60%) do feel like carmaggedon, though.

Mayor downside is playing time.  2, 3, 4 hours, and gameplay does get repetetive after a while.

Backed the Kickstarter, at the Fugitive Level. Season 2 Prison Outbreak, Toxic City Mall, and Zombie Dogs. I also added all the KS exclusive Survivors....and who can resist the Mustache Pack?

Expected delivery: Sept. 2013
Arrived: Oct. 22 2013

My big box of Kickstarter goodies has arrived! My son and I had a blast unpacking everything.

I sold all of this, as for what the game was, it took waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyy too long. Like, I didn't feel like playing anymore after an hour long.
It's all right, and the objectives and such make the game more interesting than a run, shoot, kill, chop and splatter zombies all over the place. But they don't add enough variety to keep the slug-fest interesting for 3 or 4 hours.

Much too long for what it is. You have to really love zombie themes and long games to enjoy Zombicide.

Most cooperative games suffer from "one player says others what to do" or "my special ability makes me do always the same action".
Zombicide is different as most survivors are quite equal. Only few advantages differ them. As a single action is fastly executed there is not much downtime between turn. Cards may offer real surprises so that they players have to adopt the new situation.
Best cooperative game I now as long you like the Zombie Theme. It has great potential to create own characters or equipment cards. The Minis are cool.
So far played: M0 and M4 (both won), M3 (fail), TCM07 and TCM08 (both won).

Used as an extension of the seaon 1.  The berserkers add a nice touch by increasing the importance of melee weapons.  I decided to downgrade it a little bit as the scenario are not as good as the one of the first season, too much ways of blocking the zombies.

By now Zombicide has taken the first real steps toward becoming a sandbox game. It's still really good fun and with all the new components tokens and extra zombies, the possibilities are endless. 

Downside. If you are new to Zombicide this game might seem a bit confusing. Having a sandbox game is cool but also take a lot of time to adjust to suit your groups need..

But ehm.. Im getting close to my 60th game of zombicide and it still keep me wanting for more. So I am constantly creating new missions and trying to find rumors regard season 3.

Zombicide: Prison Outbreak is a lot of fun to play with friends. I would suggest a group of 4+.

However, I was disapointed by the general quality of the product. At 95$, I would have expected bigger more durable equipment and zombie cards, character sheets made of better quality cardboard and slightly bigger miniatures. The rule book feels à little cheap too. Glossy thin paper from cover to cover isn't what I call high quality. It is beautifully illustrated though.

I bought this game before even trying season 1, for the rules complements seemed more exciting. With the addition of berserkers, I felt it would be great. And it is!

The fun this game provides is real, but isn't worth a 100 bucks. Try to buy it second hand, trade it or play a sample game before investing.

Actualmente "out of the Group"

Yera lo vendio. éste, el Toxic City Mall, el Rue Morgue, los mapas de la 1º temporada y varias expansiones pequeñas (perros, perros zombie, cuervos y no se si me dejo algo). no veia mesa lo suficiente, o yera acabo hasta el moño del par de normas chetas que tiene y que dejan el juego medio roto. :/

Aclamado como el gran y mejor juego de zombies en la epoca de mayor zombiemania conocida, llega este juego cuya carta de presentacion es una cuidadisima escenografia y jugabilidad reflejo de los clasicos del cine y las series del genero. 

Tecnicamente es un gran juego. Jugablemente tengo mis reservas (de ahi la un poco baja puntuacion). Mi principal reserva es la excesiva dificultad derivada de la aplicacion de algunas normas que en mi opinion son excesivamente "chetas" para "el malo" (es un juego sin "señor supremo", los malos son autodirigidos con una serie de normas, al estilo de gears of war, p.ej), y como digo, esta dificultad lo hace excesivamente desesperante y frustrante para el jugador. 

No quiero que se me entienda mal, no estoy pidiendo paseos por el campo. En eldritch y en gears tambien he perdido mas del 50% de las partidas y no tengo ese poso de frustracion que tengo con zombicide. no es el "que" sino el "como" de, como ya digo, ciertas normas, como la prioridad de alcance de los disparos, que estan hechas de modo a proposito para hacerlo mas dificil.

Arcadia Quest introduced me to CMON and I decided to take a look at their Zombicide franchise since it's so popular and coming to Kickstarter again. Managed to borrow Prison Outbreak.

At first, when I opened the box I was overwhelmed by how cheap the game looked. The price is absolutely laughable for the easter egg toys you are supposed to play with. You might aswell spend the money on Kinder eggs. You'd get to eat all that chocolate at least. But the miniatures aren't the only place where savings were made: the player boards couldn't be more fiddly and the messy rulebook was obviously written in a whim. Even the dice are sad and ugly, the kind you can buy for a dollar. CMON has benefitted greatly from Kickstarters where they give away tons of "free" stuff as stretch goals to fool buyers into thinking they are making a good deal.

Ok, Zombicide is way way overpriced. How about the gameplay? Well, I can see the appeal but it just doesn't appeal to me. The gameplay is extremely simple which makes it a good party/gateway game but it left me bored right away. You can move an ugly miniature, draw a tiny item card (since bigger ones would have cost more) and throw a sad dice to kill a zombie. That's it. And all the items are just slightly different weapons. After the players have had their fun it's time to move the zombies. The zombie movement can get quite fiddly when the board is crowded since some zombies move differently. The only way to recognise these zombies is to go through all the poor plastic miniatures and try to find the ones who have their legs posed a bit differently. They are called runners. The only thing the zombies actually do is cause auto-wounds for whoever shares a zone with them. There's no more interaction than that. The whole gaming experience feels very incomplete since there's nothing to do. That might just have been the designers' whole point since that creates an opening to sell tons of overpriced expansions to keep the money flow coming.

Zombicide.. Each to their own, I guess.

Counts for Toxic City as well as the various other mini expansions:

This adds a ton of needed variety to the game. Perhaps we will play it out to the point where it gets boring again, but have not yet reached that point. Now the game forces you to really strategize how you go about things as you go along, and is now complex enough that it is very difficult for one person to run the whole thing without making a mistake (which is crucial for a good coop game).

Mission 4:
Wir sitzen im Gefängnis und brauchen irgendso einen Schraubendreher von der Werkstatt gegenüber. Also öffnen wir die Sicherheitstüren, laufen raus durch die Zombiehorden, und kommen dann wieder zurück.
Wir haben gewonnen, sobald die Sicherheitstür wieder schliesst, egal ob es noch Zombies im Inneren gibt.
Das Setting war etwas Lahm und Anfangs dachte ich: zu wenig Zombies (was sich aber schnell geändert hatte). Insgesammt war es recht nett, aber mir gefiel Black Plague bisher besser. Die Regeln waren mir irgendwie uneindeutig und das Setting und vor allem das Artwork war irgendwie so schief gezeichnet...

Playing a friends copy. Good fun. Pretty straight forward and so far not particularly difficult (have not played the original). Like the character development with experience which gives a vague RPG element. I like the need to be careful with the 'sequence' of the character moves, or characters end up dead quite quickly. The play elements remind me of Space Hulk (the need to correctly sequence moves and especially the fear factor from being surrounded, out numbered and about to die at any moment), but it is far more involved.

Would recomend for all lovers of coop, zombie theme or new gamers.

not just an expansion but a stand only game in its own right - This version adds a group of beserk zombies that can only be killed with melee weapons. game is totally compatable with original so both games could be mixed together . The only problem is there doesnt seem to be any markers on the cards to indicate which set they come from - setting up and packing away is a long enough process this makes it even worse.
I like the fact they havent messed with any of the original rules - Chuck dice slay zombies

Another fun addition to my Zombicide collection! Adds the Zombivor element to the game which is nice. It was always a bummer if someone died 30 mins into a 3 hour game and they just had to sit there. Some things were fixed from the first season. Best part is building your own campaign using pieces from both!

This went over terribly with my group and instantly ran into some weird game balance problems.  Ranged weapons hitting friendies automatically is extremely problematic - abombinations are annoying until you nerf them with doors they don't seem to be able to go through?  Blah.

My first play of this particular expansion for the Zombicide franchise. Alas, it wasn’t the greatest experience due not to the game itself but the scenario we played was, I am sorry to say pretty easy, to the point of being flawed. I played at an open gaming session with a somewhat unpleasant adolescent (whose carer dumped him on us while going off doing her own thing) who at one stage accused other players of cheating (they weren’t he just didn’t listen when we explained that you go up to four actions when you reach yellow) and didn’t really do much to enjoy the game or help the group - a direct quote from one player when he complained about the lack of action his characters were having was "we’re up here fighting Zombies; you're down there fiddling with a door." That was as terse as it got; he was encouraged to use his characters a little more adventurously so not table flippingly terrible but not fantastic.

I was in two minds on this. On the one hand I am a huge advocate of encouraging kids to join in games but on the others hand it’s not much fun using one’s severely limited leisure time to play with someone who detracts from the experience. On my third mutant hand I guess it was open gaming and one has to accept that not everyone will play the way that one considers to be ‘right’ so one just has to wear it and hope that good behaviour will ‘rub off’ on any recalcitrants.

Anyway, I digress. I should also say that we played a scenario with cars. Now, I know a lot of people hate on the target priority rules but I can handle that for shooting. Cars are, I suggest, the most seriously broken element of the game in that they are way more deadly than they should be (i.e. attack everything in the zone when you enter and then again when you leave) but don’t have any chance of crashing regardless of how many zombies they plough into. In effect this meant that two characters drove about the place racking up huge kill tallies (all spawn zones were in the streets) without any real risk to themselves while everyone else skulked about and had a very easy job of clearing the prison. I prefer my games to have more tension and the very real risk of failure rather than being cakewalks.

Howsoever, aside from playing a flawed scenario dominated by an aspect of the game I dislike and with one less than pleasant player I still must say that Zombicide Season 2: Prison Outbreak seems to be have the potential to be another solid expansion for Zombicide. I’m not sure if I don’t prefer Zombicide: Toxic City Mall more, but I’ll definitely give this expansion a few more goes before I am able to fully assess it. 

After all, this less-than-stellar experience didn’t stop me pledging for season three - I know, I am a weak, weak man.

I loved Black Plague, so I picked this up along with the other seasons. Despite the decisions made for the targeting rules, I found this game to be just as good as Black Plague. Now, I did play this with the first three seasons mixed in, so this is more of a rating for the modern-day Zombicide experience as a whole. Some of the items are a little under-powered, and the rules for cars are a little odd, but otherwise I had a lot of fun with this. Berserker Zombies and the ones that turn into crawlers make things interesting, too. I think the one area where these older Zombicide seasons struggle more with is the tension. Black Plague does a good job of making things tense throughout, while the older Zombicides are pretty tame until people start getting more XP. Not that there's anything wrong with these decisions, but I do think Black Plague, as a whole, works better, mechanically, than the other seasons.

Zombies! Awesome production values. Love this.. Only rated down as it gets Warhammer expensive to "collect them all", and requires a considerable time investment for an otherwise 'light' gateway game. Good fun though, would be cool if you had a base and had more of a survival aspect to it vs pure combat.

Fantastic expansion! This provides more equipment to play more awesome scenarios of Zombicide. Some nice features are the door switches, rotating security gates, new cars, amazing new equipment cards, etc. Don't forget to check out the long list of scenarios on the Guillotine games website. Also, some of the scenarios from the rulebook are updated with corrections and small changes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A neat co-op with simple rules which mesh thematically nicely with the simple beasts that keep on coming. Lots of different scenarios, but basically you have 3 actions with which to move, shoot (dice rolling) or get a card which will generally provide ongoing item-type benefits. Same comment as the original really as it's much the same feel. What makes this a bit different is that the zombies don't fight. They have a search algorithm to come after you, and if your turn ends with a zombie on your space, you're taking a wound. Two wounds and you're kaput. And moving off a space requires an extra action for each zombie on that space. So if you get cornered and fail to shoot your way out of there by rolling well, you could be inundated. Nicely thematic. Meaning the game does actually require you to plan and co-ordinate with your fellows. There's randomness in the spawning, there's randomness in the shooting - manage it as best you can. It comes in at the right length. Fun all round.

Ugh, if you like moving and searching then this is the game for you!  If you like fighting zombies, look somewhere else.  Somehow, on virtually every turn, there were never any zombies to fight so I would simply move and search.

"I found a hammer. Anyone need a hammer? No? OK, I'm done."

Over and over and over.  I played 3.5 games and never leveled up.  Leveling up seems cool in theory and it would've been nice to fight more zombies in this game.  It SEEMS possible because the other players were able to fight zombies... unfortunately it just usually worked out that the zombies were all dead when it got around to my turn.

Not a bad game. I just expected more. What's best about it are the large numbers of zombies. My non-gamer friends seem to really enjoy it. I think the scenarios don't bring enough to the table for me. And that's where Last Night on Earth trumps it. And the great variety of cards with items as well as events. Zombicide is just more and more zombies appearing on the board until you are flooded. And then there's the 1-2 weapons that kill the big guys. If they get on the board early you'll spend all game running away from them and searching for the 2 weapons that can deal with them. Would like to try it with Toxic Zombies. And it does provide an ”edge of your seat” experience.

I have only played this once so far (and likely won't play again) - but based on the one scenario I have played (and I was informed that others are broadly similar), this does seem to be a slightly better implementation than the original Zombicide, but not enough for me to increase my rating from 5. The improvement is that having to get characters on to and off switches in order to open gates does add some welcome puzzle-like aspects to the play, and forces you to consider how to split up your party and what the best items are to leave with each group. But at core this is the same dull find-weapons-and-hope-to-kill-zombies dice-roller.

Worse than Season 1. Adds playing time and the missions are even worse than the ones in Season 1. Many rules are unclear (which is amazing considering how simple of a game this is).

I really liked the original Zombicide. This game adds new scenario's, new equipment and a new zombie type to the game. It can be played on its own or in combination with the original game. I've mostly used pieces of this game (and Kickstarter promo's) with the original scenario's.

Some of the new weapons are very cool. There are now more ways than just the Molotov Cocktails to kill Abominations (new weapons or combinations of equipment) and interesting new abilities (like Joshua's [i]Lifesaver[/i]). The new terrain features (switches that open the doors on entire cell blocks, rotating doors, barbed wire,...) add interesting choices to scenario's, but unfortunately they sometimes add to the setup time too.

I think Prison Outbreak is good, but it doesn't only add new ideas to the base game - which was fun because of it's simplicity and (depending on the scenario) relatively short playing time.

The best part of the game are the minis and the new berserker zombies. The early missions and map tiles are a mess compared to Season 1. Riddled with mistakes and confusing gameplay, not well thought through. If you're new to Zombicide, by all means, start with Season 1 and if you want an expansion, get Toxic City Mall next. Then move onto Season 2 once you have a good handle on the game.

A good build-off of the the original game. Berserker zombies add a nice challenge and the puzzle-aspects that show up occasionally really up the teamwork and cooperative aspects of the game as well. My only complaint is that some scenarios seem to reward and facilitate strategies that essentially boil down to durdling about forever in safe zones until you have all the best weapons and at least one molatov coctail.

Once the rules were explained the game was easy enough. I played a bit too reserved in the beggining and spent most of my time opening doors quietly. This meant mid game was kinda boring as others were powered up with good gear and smashing zombies while I stood there moving about miles from the action. Then I got the Katana and Wachachi Combo and started wreaking zombies. So in short make sure to get involved and be a bit gung ho and you will have fun

[thing=137988][/thing] is basically the same thing as [thing=113924][/thing] only more, hum, berserker. There are some new abilities for the survivors (like taunt or loud), new items (flamethrower, waskizashi, kukri, nightstick, and others), but these are basically just for show. The real difference is the berserker zombies that are killed only by melee weapons, since this changes the dynamics and tatics of the game.

The dogs are, also, a pain in the ass, mainly because they are runners on drugs: they move 3 spaces and are the last ones to be killed in any zone they are in. Bastards, all of them, and I'm not even a cat person.

We haven't used the Zumbivors (or something like this - the Survivor when killed return as a Zumbivor, still in the Survivors side, but with a few differences) so I can't say more about it.

If you like [thing=113924][/thing], I can see no reason why you wouldn't also enjoy [thing=137988][/thing]. If you don't liked [thing=113924][/thing], well, probably [thing=137988][/thing] won't change you opinion.

Few games offer as much straight up fun as this game. The rules are simple so it's easy to pick up, but the challenge is real. Great balanced buildup in player strength versus the growing number of enemies. The game is amost guaranteed to end on a high.

Caters to nerds as well as their spouses. Best with 3 players (2 characters each).

More of the same with Zombicide, and more minis than a person needs.

It is quite fun, but I find the setup time s bit excessive and the game a little slow for what it is.

But it is the best game to just blow through Zombies.

Excellent game for my friends and our kids!  Some missions have been too hard for us, but we enjoy trying to beat them.  I have never had so much fun losing a game!  I would give it a 10, but there are couple rules and cards (zombies get an extra action) that I don't think make sense and make the game too hard.

Great game. The berserker zombies create some tricky situations where you have to jump into the horde of zombies to get anywhere. Some rules are strange, like the auto-targeting of other survivors, but it is very fun to play.

A noticeable upgrade to season !:
New rules that add depth & diversity, 
slightly better art, slightly better miniatures.
My son -really- enjoys this series, & that makes me happy.

Introduced this game to a group of 6 new players 
ranging from 14-50 yrs old, and it was a real Smash Hit.
The player-made Bruce Campbell quotes alone 
made this one of the best gaming Days I've had in months.

If you like any of the current generation of Campy Zombie films 
(Planet Terror, Zombieland, Sean of the Dead)...?
This one is a no-brainer (hah!)
Just too much fun in one box: a Great value.

I would recommend this season slightly more than season1.
Both are excellent, but this one just has more "stuff" to it: 
More add-on rules, more challenges;
 Get Both, but get this one first.

The first set was fantastic.
This second bite at the doughnut was still tasty.

Verdict: Success

Review Date: May 2017

Positives: Simple to learn. Great Co-op Game for those who like minis and killing a lot of zombies! Beautiful production of models, some other components could (and did) improve with Black Plague edition (player boards). 


Negatives: Can lead to alpha gamer syndrome if not playing solo. Some rules make no real sense (shooting other players for one). Can become surprisingly mathy for such an ameritrash game. You either win with no challenge or get completely annihilated, very little middle room which is where the flavour is. Horrendously long setup and take down time


Conclusion: Needs some house rule fudging, but does exactly what it says on the tin
 

Score 7....easy kill, easy kill, easy kill, loot, repeat, repeat...get horribly crushed or win without threat

I loved the concept and bought this game. After all, what could go wrong with a co-op survival game? Sounded fun, but after that things went extremely wrong - an annoying mechanic that targets players first tries to make the game harder but makes the game less fun. Also, most of your turns are spent 'searching' to find that Glass Bottle and Fuel for that molotov to kill the stack of zombies amassed outside the door. Also an FAQ should be included in the game set or some house-rules made to make the game more playable.

Great concept however the game is full of mechanics - makes the game have an 'unpolished' feel. I usually love coop games but this one didn't cut it for me :(

Still great fun, but season 2 seems a good deal more "puzzly" to me than the original zombicide which was just a matter of slaughtering for entertainment.  Not that this is necessarily a bad thing as Prison Outbreak will scratch a different itch, as it were.  Still, I see myself playing the original more often than this one and if I were to recommend one of the two, season 1 would be the call without a doubt.

Impresionante juego de zombies donde todas las partidas son diferentes y llenas de tensión hasta el final. Cada Superviviente es único con sus habilidades y van ganando experiencia en el juego y consiguiendo nuevas acciones. La calidad de las miniaturas hacen al juego muy inmersivo. Impagable ver la cantidad de hordas de zombies que pueden ir a por los jugadores. El hecho de contar con numerosas misiones, ya sean oficiales o creadas por los jugadores, le da una rejugabilidad muy alta.

Yes, the rule-book is atrocious; and some aspects of the game-play are convoluted. But it is a remarkably fine area control game, and thematically it's probably the best game I've played about building a city. There is just enough randomness to keep the game interesting and replayable.

However, make sure you know how to "properly" play: choose when to side with the elite, and when to side with the proletariat and push for anarchy; AND know when's the right time to switch sides! Reading the current situation in Barcelona is the key in this very well-balanced game.

A unique Eurogame that tells on an enjoyable way an interesting part of the history of Barcelona. You really feel the theme and has clever mechanics. Every single thing brings you there.

RATING: 7
Many euro games play lip service the theme and setting but this one does justice to the theming and there is lots of interesting theme text to read and explore.  The game choices are not that interesting for the fiddle/time factor and could benefit from streamlining.  Also the game is bad in the rich get richer poor get poorer stakes.  Whoever comes last in the prestige race gets 1 less action a round and loses ties, that can make it harder for them to get the better classes of cards so they can struggle to come back.  If you want a non confrontational game with a bit of area control and a lot of theme that is not on the surface (dry euro) but not far underneath this is a good pick but in all aspects other than the historical integration there are games that offer more interesting decisions or quicker play.

Not difficult.  Play your hand, get buildings out there and try to glom onto others to score at the end of a round.  But, in building, the higher value buildings cause you to dump workers into an area that can cause you to lose prestige.  it also drives the game to potential anarchy.  If this happens, building scoring reverses.  You have to ride the edge.  To get good cards, you either need to lead in prestige, or have the most of a type of middle class/lower class building in the zones, which gets you popularity cards.  They are important as they allow you do break rules a bit.  I only played two player but I enjoyed it.  With 3 or 4, the battle to get in on scoring will be harder fought.  I don't feel this will ever be a favorite but I do enjoy this one (it is definately a Euro).

Not well received by the BGG community, but I have watched a gameplay video and thought it looked interesting. The scoring is cumbersome, but I liked the tactical decision making and beautiful art. Something to just keep in mind.

This game is extremely frustrating. As a city planner and historian it spoke to me. The art is gorgeous, it has interesting take on city building and labor mechanics, and the production is out of this world. Again, like many city planning games the building is bizarre and abstract, scoring 4s with an obelisk. There are many innovative ideas going on but the entry point was really high and the things that score go away so you don't look back at this cool city you've built cause it gets wiped and the buildings are so cool, but there aren't enough!. I urge everyone to try it and I'm playing it again, but it was a really big disappointment. The limited card play is cool but you can really really get screwed, get a worse hand, and have to try and catch up. The strike card helps a little, but I just found frustration all over.  Very clever execution of a historic event and bold ideas I'm not sure I felt that this game was compelling in any way.

Played three 2-player games. It's quite good once you get the hang of it. The rulebook is a bit hard to learn from, but it is thorough. You'll want a 3rd party player aid for end of phase and round actions.

RATING: 3
SO disappointed in this one.  Great bits that are somewhat dysfunctional (colors, obelisks that fall over) and a leader problem that dramatically rewards the person who's currently ahead in the tie breaker (prestige) area.  May be better with 3 or 4, but we will never play it again as a 2-player.

I am so upset with this game two player, I can't speak to 3 or 4 player but I suspect the problems I found are similar. I am particularly angry because the art is gorgeous, and the meeply bits are a joy, the mechanics are original and mostly functional, BUT this game does not work. In our two plays the game was decided in the first round when one player jumped out ahead on the prestige track. Way too much power is given to this prestige track and the rich just keep getting richer. All the person in the lead needs to do is make sure that they play buildings with the highest number of roofs and occasionally make sure they are in the running to break ties (easily done when you have special abilities galore and more flexibility in what buildings you can play.) The advantages for having the most prestige are significant, and impossible for those behind to overcome. In the first game I jumped out to a quick lead in prestige, Sam got a starting hand of city cards that forced him to play a ton of two roofers, and that was it... The second game I had a fairly decent starting hand, but Sam ended up one prestige point ahead of me, and that was it. He decided to make no independent choices the entire game, just play the highest number of roofs every time. He won by 10 points or so. I did manage to get ahead of him in prestige in the very last round, but that didn't matter at that point. Avoid this one folks...

Me sorprendió mucho la primera partida. Aprendido del manual de una sola leída, pero consultando lo pasé a cada rato. Necesaria una ficha de ayuda detallada. 
No hay mucho AP, se siente el tema, se usa cartas, colocación de losetas, uso de mayorías y cierta gestión de los edificios los cuales puntúan.
ganas de segunda partida.

Mi opinión en [b]http://zacatrus.es/u/miqueljornet[/b]:

☛ Jugado en el Club Amatent (con Gaujoy, Higinio y David III).

✔ Es un juego sobre Barcelona, y más concretamente sobre una parte de Barcelona que merece mucho la pena conocer: el plan urbanístico del Eixample (Ensanche). Cuando la ciudad decide romper sus antiguas murallas para abrirse al mar por un lado y para acoger más población por el otro. La base radical (la proyección y construcción de las cuadrículas de edificios) se podría haber resuelto únicamente con mecánicas abstractas y el juego no me habría impactado tanto... pero el diseño va más allá y, por encima y debajo de esa abstracción formal, trata de explicar conflictos de clase y dilemas morales sin dictar claramente a los jugadores "haz esto" o "no hagas lo otro"... y eso es extremadamente difícil de conseguir a nivel de diseño en un juego, pero aquí ocurre y creo que es algo que debo recomendar experimentar a cualquier persona apasionada por los juegos.
✔ Por otro lado, aunque en la primera partida la dinámica no llega a seducir tanto como puede pasar con otros juegos del mismo corte "eurotrash" de duración similar (90 minutos), te deja con muchas ganas de experimentar con otras estrategias en siguientes partidas: forzar la revolución anarquista, intentar dominar de principio a fin en el track de prestigio... esta sensación de "necesidad de probar cosas nuevas" es un rasgo muy positivo en favor de una ligera rejugabilidad contenida dentro del propio juego.
✔ Algunos aspectos de la producción son excelentes: mucha madera, ilustraciones de lujo a cargo de David Parcerisa, cartón de buena calidad para las losetas. Da la sensación de que se paga por lo que realmente te llevas en estos tiempos que corren en los que hay muchos juegos por 80 o 100 euros.  
✔ Posee recursos interesantes que se ajustan muy bien al tema: la carta de huelga que hace perder un turno a quien la tiene cada ronda y penaliza al jugador que se la queda en la ronda final, el track que puede propiciar la revolución que va elimiando paulatinamente la posibilidad de puntuar por monarquía, colonias y burguesía o cartas como las de los antiguos equipos del F.C. Barcelona o el R.C.D. Espanyol que representan un poco el opio para adormecer el malestar de las masas populares de la ciudad.

✘ Hay aspectos de la producción que no me acaban de gustar: el reglamento podría ser más preciso, alguna iconografía de las cartas es confusa (puntos de prestigio y puntos de victoria), el texto "aromático" de algunas cartas se repite, la mecánica de roles ocultos puede permitir hacer trampas a jugadores tramposos intercambiando tokens de su stock personal y quizá se agradecería una hoja de ayuda (con las puntuaciones/popularidad que reporta cada edificio) más allá de la guía de la secuencia de turno que ya tenemos todos los jugadores en nuestro tablero personal.
✘ Tendría que probar la escalabilidad a otro número de jugadores. Se ha modulado ampliando el número de turnos a medida que se juega a más jugadores y también jugando con 2 distritos a 2/3 jugadores y con 3 distritos a 4 jugadores. En principio parece estar bien compensado, pero da la sensación de que jugarlo a 2 debe ser más analítico y táctico que jugándolo a 3 o 4 jugadores. 
✘ Tengo la duda de si existe una estrategia 100% ganadora.

Delightfully fresh ideas for area influence, hindered by thematic overcomplexity and annoying luck of the draw. Non-standard oversized 90% empty cards for artistic reasons only. Rulebook lacking in clarity and completeness.

Gioco non adeguatamente apprezzato dal mercato che invece io non disdegno. Per prima cosa apprezzo la grafica e la ricerca di elementi che differenzino dallo standard su cui si sta andando. Anche la ricerca storica di ambientazione e riproduzione di determinate situazioni mi è parsa intrigante e suggestiva, il gioco è un card driven con maggioranze. Interazione molto forte ma di conseguenza anche cattivo king making. Da riprovare.

I agree that the rules can be a challenge, but I don't deduct points for that. Otherwise, this is a beauty of a tile laying game with historical flavor. Very strategic and tense! And it looks absolutely fantastic!

The rules are poor, very, very poorly written, which will definitely ruin your first experience when playing this as you have to look up things all the time. Why ain't the scoring nowhere mentioned, or the end game VP? A good player aid would do wonders for this game.

The game itself: fine game, but with a certain take-that - level (but a level I can personally live with). It requires definetly some plays before you will fully understand the mechanics.

So this game was kind of getting a bad rep around these parts. I am here to counter that. I really found this game to be very strange when learning it but by the end of the game I found it tricky and thinking. There are a lot of moving parts and it is well worth the journey to play the full game with 4 players. I was skeptical but I have been converted to a fan. I hope if you get the chance to try it you do.

Preordered from Essen purely because of the theme (a rarity for me) - my wife being from a socialist Barcelona family. 

Beautiful looking game, great theme. Played twice now (3 and 4) and once we got our head around the inelegant and opaque rules, I've discovered that regardless of what you do, the games end ridiculously close. It's too balanced! Doesn't seem to matter if you ignore the prestige track, what buildings you build, what patrons you take - the games finish very close (1VP and a tie). In both our games the winner was determined by the final prestige card. It was so close, whoever got it won!

The issue is the restricted number of actions you can do with a city or popularity card. Everyone only ever gets four cards, and moves are fairly obvious. There's just not enough scope for strategy or even smart tactical play. Everyone plays a similar number of buildings with similar VP. 

It's an extremely light game, posing as a heavy euro - and a long one too with some painful scoring and an awful counting chore to determine card deals for the next turn. One more play and, at a significant loss, will most probably go on the sale pile. Playable, but too obtuse.

Seems sadly like so many recent titles - some really nice ideas, but they aren't really well fleshed out and tested to make for a compelling game. I find the cards pretty limiting overall and your choices just aren't that interesting - you often can manage to get a decent number of majorities (especially in a 3-player game) and so your set of cards is pretty good. The prestige track is cool, but I find that it's hard to control that, given the cards that you have. The whole flow of placing buildings is poor - it's slightly delayed before you score them, which also makes this less than intuitive, plus you don't just wait until the end to score  (I understand you couldn't have the cool pieces this game comes with if you had to cover the board with them), which neuters the really cool idea of the threat of anarchy dramatically changing the scoring. I want to like this game more, yet find that I cannot. I'll probably play it again a time or two to solidify my rating, and could see me either appreciating it a little bit more, or finding that it still just flows poorly.

If ever I watch paint dry I can say it is as boring as playing Barcelona. Dull repetition of building rounds, decisions i found uninteresting for the length of the game. Nice production.

I am not big on tile-laying or area control games, but these aspects weren't bad. However, the prestige board, and especially the bag draw, seemed too random. This isn't a bad game, but my play didn't grab me. The player aids were useless and a cheat sheet for the tasks for each step of a round would have been nice.

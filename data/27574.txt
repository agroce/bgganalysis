Theme really feels like it's pasted on and ultimately it's admitted to at the end of the rule book. The game is fairly simple to learn but is really just about making shapes and feels dull. While I'm not a huge fan of bidding, it's nice to see it actually have some meaning apart from just playing first which makes it more palatable. Sold.

Ugh. Where to start? My group hates aggressive games, so I usually seek out some aggression on my on-line games to "balance it out" or something.

However, when a game is aggressive, it must always give you a chance of making a comeback, little as it might be. A game must always give you the chance of getting back on your feet, and doing the best you can with what's left. A game that fails to do this is simply not fun, neither for the winning player (as there's already not much of a challenge), but specially not to the losing player, who must patiently wait for the torture to end.

Meet Huang-Di. A game where if you get screwed, you're screwed for the rest of the game. True, there is some satisfaction in blocking other players from reaching their goals in their cards... but as the building space is so narrow, there is a very good chance players who get blocked once or twice simply can't do anything else in the game.

Plus, when you know there's nothing else you can do, the game loses it's interest completely. It isn't fun to watch even the other players struggling for first place... you just want it to end.

Overall, an interesting design, but with an aggression level even higher than I can handle.

2013, 2-4p, 90 min.  Card game, role selection, pattern bldg, and auction/bidding (blind bidding for turn order each round... blech!!).  Remake/re-imp of Huang Di (almost produced by JKLM games) and instead of building the Great Wall of China, you're building a prison in Island Fortress.  There is a 5-6p expansion for Island Fortress, but it'd probably be too long/painful with a high player count (hard to plan ahead).

Based on Tom Vasel's review: Just average, but some will like due to lots of thinking and role selection.  There's a lot going on, and it's hard to follow since the gameplay doesn't mesh with the theme.   Regarding components, the boards could have been a bit thicker.  Small rich-get-richer problem (hard to catch up), especially if players gang up on an individual.

Other BGG users say: Lots of tough decisions, many ways to score points, slow due to complexity and the number of decisions, Also, turn order (and bidding for it) is VERY important (the fact that players play clockwise after the bid winner might be annoying for some people).

I wanted to like this game. It seems like a lot of love and attention was put into it, and maybe it is fun for a certain type of gamer, but it just wasn't any fun for me. It was overly complicated with too much of a mishmash of game mechanics. It was just too much trouble for the type of game that (I think) it should have been. There are some good ideas here. I wish it could have been streamlined into something fun to play.

Refraining from rating this - backed on KS due to hope the tetris-like matching game was a large component. In fact the game is 80% worker placement Euro, with the fort wall / matching minigame relegated to an interesting sideshow. It's not my cup of tea, but if you enjoy Euros this may be yours.

Players are controlling a team of workers, assisting in building the wall of a fortress.  Fun, action allocation game, where players play role cards from their hand and take actions.  The various actions accumulate income and resources required to complete sections of the wall.  The resources include jade, workers, convicts, wall sections, and so on.  The wall is represented by a grid of columns and rows, and is gradually filled in with player tiles.  Secret objective cards can be played when certain "patterns" of player wall tiles are completed, which grant rewards.  The game ends when the wall is complete, and most points wins.

Nice game - quite easy to learn, although the recall mechanism takes a little bit of understanding.  The objective cards give the players something to focus on, and the game doesn't overstay it's welcome.  Solid stuff.

There are a couple of nice ideas but the execution is far from ideal, starting with the graphical design and ending with game theory. Somewhat paradoxically, I think there is far too little player interaction, what little there is feels forced, and yet is can easily take players out of the running entirely. It doesn't really help that there is only one major source of victory points and only one path to get there.

Island Fortress feels like one of those poster children for Kickstarter games driven mostly by enthusiasm but lacking some serious development work.

I have only played the online implementation of JKLM Interactive so my judge is of that version. This is an interesting game mechanics and scoring considered. It is smart and it can be pretty tight depending on that you have different strategies and the many ways to score on. Much of the strategy in this game revolves around timing on things and the order you do things, but I can’t say that I really grasped it.

So while this is interesting in a mechanics and scoring considered, it isn’t as interesting for me personally. I don’t find it dull, just that it doesn’t trigger me or I feel there is something special about it, i.e. not my kind of game.

I think it plays pretty well for a number of different players. With six players it gets a little crowded at the endgame though.

It is a kind of city building game. More exactly defined, Island Fortress is a wall building game. Players compete for building castle wall with resources, such as money, barriers and human strength. The game is quite ok, but not so attractive enough. For me, Island Fortress is a mediocre city building game. It is not my cup of tea, so that I sold away.

REALLY enjoyed my first play of this. Feels like Ticket to Ride route building mixed with Puerto Rico role selection and a Dominant Species area majority game. Lots of tough decisions, lots of player interaction. Boards are thin and already a little warped. For a game I felt hasn't gotten much buzz, was very pleasantly surprised.

-Update- Had just as much fun second play. Great interaction, a great cooperative-competitive feel. The role selection to area majority works very well.

Samen aan een grote muur bouwen. Met Sven Tim en Arne. Zware uitleg, maar na 1 spel al veel helderder. Figuren bouwen met je eigen stenen binnen een muur waar iedereen samen aan bouwt. Ingezet een puzzelspel maar dan omgevormd tot zware eurogame met bieden voor startspelers, rolselectie, elkaar kloten en aantal Side-items voor bonus punten. Vandaag een 7, zal zeker stijgen mits meerdere keren spelen. Strategische diepgang na 1 keer spelen lijkt echt eindeloos. Enorm boeiend mechanisme, uniek in z'n soort, thematiek ver te zoeken, echt eenmechanisme waar een thema rond verzonnen werd. Je moet het echt meermaals,spelen met dezelfde groep op korte tijd maar daar is het niet 'sexy' genoeg voor. Wel prachtig artworkmaar belachelijke 'papieren' spelborden. Key is proberen een 9x9 vierkant te maken dan is elke nieuwe puzzel die je trekt meteen ook opgelost. Je kan volgens mij onmogelijk winnen zonder stevig aandeel te hebben in meerderheid van rijen en levels. Bijzonder tactisch, enkel met échte gamers spelen, er zijn weinig verzachtende factoren om de hoge instapdrempel en dezware uitleg te verzachten. Een eerste spel duurt ook makkelijk 120+.

Interesting game of planning and tactics. But really slow. Too slow to be enjoyable.

Pros:

Resource management, pattern building, and action selection are all fun. This game is a great puzzle in a few ways. What actions should you perform and in what order? Where should you place your blocks? Most of the components and artwork are really nice.

Cons:

The boards are way too thin and give the game a very cheap feel. The rulebook could be a lot better. Some rules are written in an overly wordy way and over-explained, while other important rules are written once, not bolded or highlighted in any way, and never mentioned again.

An excellent design that takes a few familiar mechanics (role choice from a set of cards, resource management, aong others) and makes a wonderful game out of them. The theme works well (you ARE in fact building a wall) and the game seems to scale quite well from 2 to 6 (though more downtime has to be expcted as the number of players increases). A great first game from Bryan Johnson, who's a very nice guy and was always willing to teach you his game and beat the pants off of you at the 2007 GoF!

A game with an excellent theme that doesn't quite manage to hide some of the "game theory" problems with the way the game plays out.

For example, the "replace" rule works well enough except in situations where two players value a certain square equally.  Then the mutual best response for each player is to build over the other.  It devolves into a "tit-for-tat" fight with very little compensation guaranteeing that neither player will be competitive.   But since each player's optimum response to a replace is to just replace right back, the "dance of death" continues.

There are other issues as well, again related to game theory.   The result is a game that has plenty of good ideas, but still needing development in order to put the final shine on the gameplay.  

It's tough too, because it's one of those games you want to like, but...

2 plays with 4, 2 plays with 2.  The game is getting better with each play. I love it as a 2 player game.

It's a very solid design.  An almost Maharaja like fell with a Goa type of scoring.  I don't see the auction and pattern building as the main mechanics.  It mostly feels like an area majority game to me, that's where most of the victory points will be coming from.

Not so good with 2 as you can avoid each other; Game can have a runaway leader- problem if someone can fullfil his favour cards early and win the petition (more) easy or doesn't have any problems taking jade anymore.

The things I wrote above were based on the JKLM-online version (called Huang-Di at that time). Bought this game for myself, just as I was curious to see what the game has become. It felt quite similar at what the game was back in 2009. But with coming out so many games out these days, it has a hard time withstanding the test of time. It's not a bad game, but it's not a great game either. However here in Europe it's a very expensive game, and it's simply just not worth the money they are asking for it, especially if you take into account that the boards you get are very very flimsy!

I have a hard time rating this one as the first game felt a bit too long, but I recognize it was a 4P game all with new players so much time was spent seeing how the actions inter-related to make for efficient turns.  Also with the building area (the wall) wide open to start, the game starts of feeling like multi-player solitaire and only becomes less so as the wall is built up and less and less area remains for the remaining plays.

Also a bit concerned about the overall length in terms of game turns.  I worked and set-up good scoring by about Turn 5, but then felt like the final turns were very mechanical squeezing out a few VPs here and there to set up for the end game scoring.  (Our game did end in Turn 8 with the wall completely built.)

Needs repeated plays to see if the game speeds up or the game arc varies more, but wonder if the group will have any energy to do so.

One of the things I do appreciate about the game is that there are different valid strategies. In one game we took wildly different approaches. I did not care for how puzzle like this game felt. This is a euro game where doing something requires doing three other things first, and never having enough to do it. There are some cool things that can be pulled off, but figuring it is a taxing brain burn. Plus it ultimately feels like a lot of work to do very little. I did not dislike this game, but I can not say I had a lot of fun playing it either.

It's an interesting game -- a good design, although not necessarily one I'd play very often. Will have to try it one more time.

It's a resource management game where you're trying to generate enough money to bid for the Emperor's favor and pay the fees to hire laborers, buy building material, build blocks, etc. Victory points are awarded by area influence, with areas defined by the 3 wall areas and level of blocks (within each area, scoring occurs when a level is complete; there's also scoring when the entire level, across all 3 areas, is complete.

Each round starts with a blind bid (money) for the emperor's favor: the winner goes first (then clockwise), and also receives a favor chip and an emperor's block (functions as a neutral color building block that you may place this turn, for example to finish a level). Play is driven by role cards -- each player has one (identical) set; they will play 3 of them, one at a time, each round. The cards allow you to hire peasants, buy material, and build 1 or 2 blocks; each action has a variable cost depending on how many you buy. Other roles give you money, allow you to gain convicts, destroy a block, take all convicts in your province, move your taskmaster token to a different area, etc. There are some special actions, too: e.g., the favor chips allow you to take the role card just played back into your hand, and play again. Most points are awarded for building blocks and completing levels. The tricky part of building is that it consumes not only building blocks, but also workers (half of all peasants used, and ALL convicts used)! So you are balancing goals of generating money, using money to do things, build, maintain a labor force, maintain area majority, etc. At the end of the game there is final scoring, with points awarded for majority of blocks built, most money, etc.

There's a lot going on in the game, with tough decisions throughout. It seemed to play a bit slowly, although perhaps only because 3 of us were new to it.

Oh my, this game made quite a journey to finally get into gamers hands. It had first been announced back in 2007. That is 7 years ago! It has since changed publishers, artwork, theme and name.
Mechanically this game works fine. But - and I'm sorry if I'm hurting anyone's feeling, I know this was a labor of love - I didn't feel like this is a game that stands up to today's standards. It didn't have that spark that makes it a game that just asks to be played. It doesn't help that the theme is completely pasted on, but I'm not too big on theme so that is not the problem. The problem is that this game simply doesn't do anything new or fresh or different nor does it do anything so remarkably well that it becomes interesting again. It's just very mediocre. If I where a publisher and was presented this game, I would turn it down.

Semi co-op tile laying game and as the title implies we are erecting a wall around an island and populating it with convicts. As master builders our actions are based on identical role cards employing our workers or placing the task master to use labor from the convicts. Bidding and action costs are paid with cool looking jade cubes. Get favor cards from the governor. Even though we build the wall together, the master builders are playing for individual wealth an notoriety by timing the completion of strategic pattern building to get majority of rows or levels of the wall. I'm not usually a fan of semi co-op's. This one is ok.

RATING: 8
Rating based on 1 solo play with 2 characters. Both died, but did have the car at the end.
Finally managed a game with other people. 5 of us defeated the zombie menace and all survived. Very fun.

This one's a relentless punisher.  We played a few games at the local game shop using their demo and lost pretty much by the end of the first wave each time.  Players were engaged, but no one had fun.  I've never had this reaction to Castle Panic.  That, to me, is the biggest differentiator.

I think this game could benefit from some rebalancing.  As authored, I can't see how the rules would allow a player win.  If we owned it, there'd definitely be some house rules.

Way better than [thing=43443][/thing].  I'll give this an extra point just pulling off a rare feat: a zombie game that not only doesn't suck but is quite fun to play.  This one 2nd only to [thing=144568][/thing].  The theme was there, as was the challenge and the fun.  Big bonus in that if you "die" you flip your card and then work WITH the zombies.  The game is over when somebody escapes or everybody is turned into zeds.  Very cool!

Really different from "Castle Panic". The only similarity is the name and components. Dead Panic is an Ameritrash, not a strategic game. It feels like a light and fast Zombicide.

I got this one because it was heavily discounted at a Black Friday sale at my FLGS.  I got it because I've had my eye on "Castle Panic," for a while and it plays well solo.  Like most people, I'm getting pretty tired of the plethora of zombie games out there.  

I've only played this a couple of times, but it's easy to play, the theme is well represented, and there are meaningful decisions to make.

So far, so good.

Surprisingly good variant of Castle Panic, and while it lacks the expansion content that game has, this is absolutely one I'll break out for people wanting the zombie theme or around Halloween. The rounds play out much the same, but the objectives are more thematic, as you collect radio pieces and try to get rescued. Fun, fast, and easy to teach.

Although there are some similar mechanics with Castle Panic, this is definitely a different game.  The theme really shows up in this one -- I found it quite immersive, and really felt like I was fighting a neverending horde of zombies.  The event cards made it feel like both games I played were very different from each other, and posed different challenges.  The endgame is really the best part -- once you leave the house and have to just survive the waves of zombies on the way to the truck just fills you with anxiety wondering if you have enough stuff to make it.

I think we are playing a rule wrong or something. Towards the end, every zombie is on the map and all of our weapons are broken. I guess that is thematic, but moving and attacking with all the zombies is so cumbersome and slow, it literally puts our group to sleep.

This game feels like it has so much potential. I think they biggest complaint I have is that it never feels like you have enough moves to do something meaningful. A lot of times the game feels like it plays you and forces you to react.

I can see what they are going for here but its just to short and shallow to hold my attention across several playthroughs. Every once in a while it feels ok to play a few times but this is nowhere near being a game you will want to play on a weekly basis.

Dead Panic is too fiddly, with far too much time spent checking sightlines and moving zombie tokens around the board.  The player's actual turn is very quick, with few interesting choices.  Castle Panic is a much better, faster moving (though simpler) game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A neat adaptation of Castle Panic.

While this game shares many similarities with Castle Panic it's different enough that I'd keep both of them.

The rulebook needs to be laid out a little better and go into a lot more detail about certain steps. The first time we played this was with 6 people, with each player taking their 2 actions then going through the other 4 steps of the game...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Better than the Castle Panic base game, but not as good as Castle Panic + Wizard's Tower. As others have said, the cabin walls are worthless, and get knocked down very quickly (not to mention the cheap cardboard components that don't even stay attached to the walls or characters!). 

But by removing the goal of protecting the cabin, Dead Panic takes away the best aspect of these "states-of-siege-type" games: defending your location! Castle Panic gives you a clear goal, with clear strategic moves you can make to accomplish that goal. Instead, in Dead Panic it feels like you are just running wildly around the board trying to pick up items. Because you can abandon the cabin (and the walls will fall down pretty quickly), the game just becomes a stupid chase. It is not very fun, and hardly strategic, though it is more difficult to win than CP, so I suppose that's a plus. 

Sadly, yet another zombie dud. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This pales in comparison to Castle Panic. The rules are a bit of a mess, and the dynamic of the automated zombie movement causes a silly "merry-go-round" effect where the baddies swirl around like toilet water before coming to their senses and trying to go after the escaping survivors. It's just a weird, clunky design -- particularly the endgame. I had high hopes for this title. Alas.

I’ve owned Castle Panic but sold it as it was too simplistic and didn’t have any “development” during the gameplay. I like coops quite a bit, but CP fell flat. I got the expansion, which helped a lot, but it still didn’t grab me. However, I still decided that I would give Dead Panic a shot as it sounded more intriguing with more possibilities and a lot more to think about each turn. Sadly, after a single play, my impression is that DP is about as dull as CP. Sure, there is more you can do on your turn, but to be honest one of the two actions you take each round is probably too often to take a card (notice that I’m not experienced with the game, but cards are very useful and often there isn’t any other good actions to take). 

Also, there are too many fiddly rules compared to how rather simple the gameplay is (I’m thinking of, for instance, how the zombies move and how range works when firing a weapon). The difficulty of the game also seemed wonky. The zombies quickly surround you, at least in my play through, but even so you can still win rather easily. 

So, while DP has more meat to it, I don’t think this makes it a good game. CP could be used as a family coop, but DP is probably too heavy for that – but even though it’s heavier it doesn’t add any interesting gameplay decisions…

There's something to be said for this game being more streamlined than Zombicide (which is the only other zombie game I've played).  The theme is well-integrated, but it seems to remove some of the tenseness of Zombicide while losing little of this genre's tedium (moving tons of zombies every turn). We also managed to avoid having any team member turn into a zombie, so I can't judge that mechanism. 

Ultimately, though, it's just not the kind of game I would ever want to play given my eurogame sensibilities:  random rolls, random events, random item draws, and cartoonish artwork.

I own(/have owned) all the Panic collection. While I generally enjoy them on a regular basis, this one just "didn't hit the spot" for me. The movement rules felt "fiddly" - that the zombies were continuously changing arcs got to be a pain to track. I felt it was the worst manual - questions just kept coming up in play (and there's a fairly large FAQ on this game). Component quality was also lacking a little bit - few of the cardboard pieces stayed together well.

In terms of difficulty, we won all but one game (and we may have lost that one due to a misinterpretation of rules) but several games were very close. It felt reasonably challenging as such.

In the end, it has several of the mechanics from other zombie games - and is the least like the other Panics - but I'd much prefer to play other zombie games (or anything else in the Panic series). That said, it was still a good value - I felt I got my money's worth within just 3 plays.

Finally broke this out and played it a few times. Confusing rule book didn't help. Played it twice last weekend, and the first time all three survivors came out in the first two rounds of pulls. Easily won that game. In the second game the survivors didn't make it out until the end. The entire zombie horde was running around the board at that point! Only one of three players made it to the van, and that person had two wounds...

Initial Rating: 5.5 (December 2014)

I wasn't expecting much from the game but I (somewhat) enjoyed it. For me it is definitively better than Castle Panic. 

It is easy to teach but with 5+ players the downtime is excessive. I also find it kind of shallow. The line of sight rules are convoluted for such a simple game. 

I really like that, although a cooperative game, some players can lose while others can win.  Love that when a player dies, he already loses the game but continues playing as a zombie and he can bring down more players :devil:. The game components are top notch and look great on the table.

Bottom line, Dead Panic is an ok CoOp game, but too simple and slow for my taste. I will probably sell the game but I'm interested in trying some variants.

A great panic game with  a zombie theme. Survive he hordes of zombies, while trying to get the 3 pieces of the radio. Call the rescue van and get to safety. 
   It adds a mechanic which makes the game "mostly" cooperative. When a character dies, you flip their character tile and they become a boss zombie. They get to choose 2 special powers and hinder the survivors for the rest of the game.

Now with some critical distance, and with some other great zombie games released in the meantime, I can appreciate what this game was trying to accomplish - but it just feels overly long for what it is. There is definite tension when the walls start coming down, but it takes so bloody long for the radio pieces to arrive that by the end game you're just ready for it to be over.

In Dead Panic, each player takes on the role of one of eight unique characters, which have special abilities. Players work together to survive in a remote cabin, at the center of the board, against waves of the undead that close in from the edges of the board. If the players can hold out, survivors bring pieces of the radio needed to call for rescue. Once rescue arrives, it's up to each player to leave the safety of the cabin and make it out alive!

Same mechanic as Castle Panic, but game play is deeper with more meaningful desisions.

RATING: 7.5
In terms of complexity, a step up from Castle Panic. I find the zombie movements can be difficult to take care of when there are a lot of them on the board, because you have to remember what you have and haven't moved yet. This was our first zombie game, but I prefer our recently added Dead of Winter.

I really thought that this would be an improvement over Castle Panic which was a decent tower defense coop game. It turns out that the game really feels off, trying to be a zombie game and a tower defense and fails at both.

I am not one to say something is empirically a bad game.  It's usually a case of different strokes, and that doubles when zombies are involved.  But this game feels like a compromise between a house-rule scenario for Castle Panic and an all-out cash-in on the zombie craze.

The worst part is, as we were playing... all I wanted to do was box the game up and pull out Last Night on Earth, which does the whole scenario thing 10x better.

Sadly the rules for this game are just too obtuse for the type of game it is. Bought this thinking it would be similar to Castle Panic in the rules department. 

But the rules are just too obtuse. I constantly had to refer to the rule book to determine zombie movement, survivor movement, timing, line of sight, using items, etc.

It was just a slog. It's worse if you try to pull this game off the shelf intermittently. you won't remember the rules and you'll feel like you have to learn the game all over again.

Also, there just didn't seem to be enough item cards.

Overall, it was ok, but not my first choice.

Wanted to love this game. Really like Castle Panic. Like zombie games. This should have been an easy like for me. Maybe I just have too many zombie games but cannot get into this one.

"Resembles like Castle Panic, but is about as complex as CP with The Wizards Tower expansion. Being able to move around is great, and completing a specific mission to win is nice. It ends up feeling much more thematic and engaging than CP. "

What I like:
- Moving around on the board is fun
- Great story arc (get radio, call van, escape in van)
- Zombies chase survivors rather than always moving forward

What I don't like:
- Fiddly rules like line-of-sight and passing the Bait token, and radio assembly
- Remembering that you have to EXCEED the target number

I definitely like it more than CP with the WT expansion, mostly because I really like games where I have an avatar who moves around. 

The official rules have dead players turning into zombies, but I won't play that way. For me, it's a pure co-op, and if anyone dies, either the rest of us will try to win in their honor, or we'll just call it a group loss right away. 

I would put the weight around 2.4, higher than BGG voters. Unlike CP, this is not a game that I would throw at just about any non-gamer.

I really need to play this with the correct rules, but it was fun. I really got about 5-10 minutes or so to read the rules and we just kind of winged it part way through.

It kept a feel of Castle Panic, but was different in it's own regard. Not sure I need this one, but I'd be happy to play it a few more times.

This is a good alternative take on the Castle Panic system that works well. Easier to have fun with if you already like Castle Panic but probably not the best way to introduce someone to this family of games.

[b]Comment:[/b] A nice game overall. Everyone is on the same team, but the theme and structure encourage people to still take their own actions and make their own decisions rather than let one player dominate everything. Based on zombie spawn numbers on the cards I imagine this gets harder the fewer players you have. We play it with 6, and it was relatively easy thanks to everyone's special abilities.

My rating is based on a single solo play. I therefore missed out on any potential for zombie traitors. Zombies gathering in a huge mob is fun to watch but like most zombie games, clever player movement wins the game and not necessarily good combat rolls.

Ok, so I'm still a sucker for zombie themes. This isn't really any better than Castle Panic, but it does have more going on. More complicated, I suppose, even if I felt like the good choices were very obvious here.in the end, i prefer Castle's simplicity and freedom over the restrictions of Dead Panic.

This game puts you under pressure very quickly you have to get on the move and get that radio together asap if you are going to make it out alive. I enjoy the stress of having the zombies coming in from all sides of the board surrounding you, the noose tightening every turn. But game play mechanics in this game are just not as tight as they should be. When it comes down to it the way zombies shamble around your cabin as you run around in circles n is a deal breaker for me. There are much better co-op zombie games out there.

I don't like the combat resolution in Dead Panic as much as in Castle Panic.  Rolling dice, usually for a 50-50 result, is tiring and random.  I much preferred the range-based auto-hit rules that requires hand management instead of luck.

Also, the rules about players turning into zombies are cute but somewhat problematic when it comes to defining victory.  As written, zombie players cannot win, so what's the point?

Also, it's a perfect coop but there are no solo rules -- this makes me a bit sad.

RATING: N/A
There's a big flaw in the game: if you use a ranged weapon when attacked in melee, you do it at no cost! You automatically kill some zombies, shooting as much ammo as you want. So there's really little to no interest to shoot during your turn, spending precious actions!

It still feels totally unbalanced to use one of your two actions to shoot once or none to shoot all your bullets.

It's clearly not wise to use your precious actions to shoot, knowing you'll do it for free (action) later. Except in the rare case you have nothing at all to do.

I always play without the option to shoot during zombie phase, and it feels more satisfying to my taste. It makes the game less "passive", too.

More interesting than Castle Panic, but it still feels like 90% of the game is just going through the motions of moving stuff around, rather than making decisions.  Watching your friends turn into zombies at the end (assuming you fail) is pretty fun though.

Conceptually similar to Castle Panic but with many new twists to keep it fresh, expand your options to match the theme, and capture the mood of the genre. Sure to delight fans of CP that are looking for a slightly meatier game. It was a big hit with adults and kids alike.

This is just Castle Panic with a zombie theme.  Yes, there are a few differences aside from the theme.  In this game the players have physical presences and can move around the board.  The victory condition also involves collecting pieces of and assembling a radio then escaping in the van you call with that radio.

That's pretty much where the differences end though.  You are still being attacked by hordes of enemies converging on walls in the center of the board and each player plays cards on their turn to help them thin out these hordes.

I will say I like this game a little bit better than Castle Panic because the decisions in this game are a little bit more interesting.  In Castle Panic, every turn you had very few options, and no interesting ones.  It was always very obvious what you should do on your turn.  Since in this game you have actual physical characters to control there are more things you can do on your turn and there are more decisions to be made.

Still not very many interesting ones though which makes it only okay to me.

Fun twist on Castle Panic, the Zombies tile get a bit un-wieldy to manage as the board begins to fill up and you lose control of the cabin.  I enjoyed the game, but I'm not sure the theme will hold up well in my household of young kids.  So, I think I'll probably pass this one on in trade.

Game was kind of a disappointment for me. Rules could have been better written and organized. More complicated than Castle Panic, but I think that's a better game, and this is coming from a zombie fan. This is a bit like Last Night on Earth, though that game is definitely superior. I thought this would scratch my Night of the Living Dead itch of being holed up in a house in the woods, but in the end it didn't live up to expectations.

Definitely a 'beer and pretzels'-level game, but of the zombie games I've played, I think this one strikes the balance BEST for being light and quick enough to not overstay the theme's welcome...but still with enough "game" to it that it feels like something is actually going on.

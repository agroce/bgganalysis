Great game - an amazing creation.  Brain-burner too.
But wow it takes a long time.  It took us 4 hours to play.  Too long for me really.

On reflection I'm not sure I'd ever choose to play again if I had other games to choose from. Downgraded to a 6.

RATING: 8
This has quite a steep learning curve because some of the mechanics are not simple and until these become intuitive it's difficult to understand strategy. However, it definately has some deep strategeies that only emerge after quite a few plays. (That Birkenhead link is several steps too far however and a great example of where Wallace - an excellent designer - really needs a good developer to get hold of his games)

If I had to say something about this game I would say: "DEEP"!
The more you play it the more you like it! Never try to judge such a Wallace's masterpiece after only one game! Even if you were well taught by a good teacher and you found the right group of gamers to play with, after your first match you'd just reach a vague flavour of the game's potential!

RATING: 7.5
I would rate this higher if not for all of the finicky building restrictions.  Seperate requirements for iron and coal seemed unnecessary.  Overall, a great resource management game.  I was slightly put off by how restricted you can be by the cards you draw, and generally how much more valuable a card like "Liverpool" is compared to "Burnley".    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A unique game. The economic system is like nothing I've seen in other games. It is always a puzzle what you should be doing and why. Such a cool representation of supply and demand. One bad thing though is the learning curve, it is not a complicated game, but it has a few difficult rules to grasp.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This might be Wallace's best game- it combines the usual tough economics, route-planning, a dry yet solid theme, and multiple ways to score.

The game is divided into two halves: 1)the canal era, and 2)the rail era.  Each turn, you use cards to select two (usually) actions.  You can: take loans (necessary at times unfortunately), place canals/rails (which are required for some shipping ala Age of Steam, and also for scoring purposes), place buildings (can be used for scoring, and needed to do pretty much anything useful), develop/drill down through your building stacks, or ship cotton (if you're set up to do it).  Although the actions are card-driven, because the cards are multi-purpose, it's relatively easy to work around a "bad draw".  

In the first half of the game, you're trying to get some sort of economic engine going, while still trying to scrape some points together.  You need to "flip" your buildings in order to score points for them, and in an interesting co-operative/competitive mechanic, your opponents will often flip them for you.  After the canal era ends, any level 1 buildings, and any canals are removed from the board (after they score points of course).  The rail era is very similar except that rails are more expensive to build, and some buildings may already be on the board.  Another interesting aspect is that start player shifts depending on who spent the least amount of funds each turn.  Scoring occurs at the end of both eras.  

The game only plays 3-4 (I wish it played 2-player, my one complaint of Wallace games), and it is deep and may be perceived as dry.  I personally like the theme for some reason, but it certaintly won't be a draw for many people.  The rules are actually quite clear for once (actually Automobile's were too, so it looks like Wallace is improving in many aspects as a full-time designer).  It's one of those games where it's a grind, but it's an enjoyable grind- a game that needs to get more plays somehow.

This may possibly be a better game than Age of Steam. Not sure yet though... the board is a mess and a nightmare that might be laid out a bit better, but that doesn't mean the game underlying that physical design isn't wonderful. I will need more plays of this to get a handle on this more clearly.

Update: This game has been one of the harder to "grok", but the more layers I reveal, the more I realize there is to come. Simply brilliant.

Magic business game with great theme about the industrial revolution in the North West of England - definitely one of my favourite games as there is development, some route building, a demand market and LOADS to think about each turn as each player's actions will affect your strategy. Works well with the smaller, 2p variant map as well. May well become a 10.

I should say, 90% of my Brass plays have been with 2 people (using the suggested 2-player variant on BGG). I will say that the game is good, it does fit several of my preferred board game mechanics. However, my judgment of Brass is not very well rounded, based on mostly using the 2-player variant. That said, the game might be better if it only took an 1 hour, instead of 2.

Wow! This game did my head in. Do not start it late at night if you have never played... but what a game! The fact that VPs and money are separate in this game is pretty n neat (relative to Age of Steam... come on you fiends!). The differences between the various eras is wild too. I made a number of mistakes in my initial play, but loved the challenge. I think Martin Wallace has another winner on his hands. It is no Age of Steam, but it is an interesting and unique challenge. I'm curious to know what I will think once I can actually play this one with some level of competency.

RATING: 10
Amazing game.  The rules are positively Byzantine but getting over that, it really is a fantastic game.  Truly well-balanced in that multiple strategies will lead to victory, and the optimal strategy depends not only on your card draw, but also your opponent's actions.  Somebody said in a review that Brass is a game where you develop a number of parasitic relationships with your opponents.  I think that's right on the money and what I like so much about the game.

1 play / 4 players (3h = 4p)

LIKE: I like the blend of game elements: positioning with turn order, race for map positioning, and race to build specific types of industries. Unique mechanisms and interaction that is not seen in many other games. I really enjoy the subtleties of the foreign and demand markets. I enjoy how there are interesting combos when building and flipping. I like the two eras, it really makes the game unique.

DISLIKE: Incredibly fiddly rules which seem obtuse and not intuitive. The rules between coal and iron are very different and causes a lot of confusion. It may take a couple plays before it smooths out. Sometimes the cards feel random and force a player's strategy.

OVERALL: Great game, very tense. I enjoy the app version as well. The base play is simple, but all the rules overhead makes the game complex and confusing.

After 1st play:
Absolutely fantastic. I kept smiling through the whole game and afterwards everyone was speculating about the outcome. This truly is a sign of a great game. However, being conservative I give Brass a rating of 9. We'll see if it deserves a full ten.


2013/01
Well, Brass didn't earn that 10 but it's still going strong after several plays. I really have to complain about the rulebook but that's the Wallace standard and cannot be helped. Furthermore, the rules are not very intuitive but eventually you'll get a hang of it.

2015-11-04
To my big surprise I sold this in an auction. Might be that I'll regret it later, but at this point of my life I just felt like getting rid of games that haven't seen any or very little play in the past 3-4 years. It seems that nowadays the games hitting the table are action packed sub 90 minute games instead of longer ones like Brass. Moreover, the complexity of the rules in Brass forces an occasional player to reread the rules every single time you want to bring the game into the table. This reduces the chances of Brass getting played. If I only had more space to store my games...

I've seen reviews saying that Brass is complicated and complex and that one gets overwhelmed by the endless variety of options to win. Oh shut up. While it is obviously no trivial game you would play on Christmas eve together with Granny who just had her traditional glass of punch, it is not as complicated as certain other train-related games. Agreeably, it might take several glasses of punch to understand why coal has to be transported on tracks and why iron is able to "fly" through half the country without ever hitting the occasional airplane (or cotton mill). And agreeably, it actually makes little sense to me that the game is called "Brass". However, as soon as someone else was willing to explain the rules to you, it is easy to grasp (the rule book is supposedly terrible, but not as terrible as the rule books of certain other train-related games). And it is fun to play - don't over-complicate it, just see how far you can go in taking that sweet, sweet money from your opponent who was gullible enough to think that investing in coal was actually a good idea! So really, why don't you sit down, grab some punch, and try another round?

Another of Wallace's greats, not sure if I prefer this to AoI mostly because it's harder to get a group of 4 players who know the system well enough to play properly. Once I've played a few times under those circumstances I can probably compare them better.

I do find the develeopment of level 1 tiles and dominance of railways to be rather overwhelming but I've mostly only played with newbies, I suspect a lot of the different scoring paths are all worthwhile if played well and railways will probably even out.

Il capolavoro di Wallace (o almeno credo.. il buon Martino ha una produzione immensa di giochi di grande livello).

Due fasi distinte (canali/ferrovie), industrie che vanno in obsolescenza, vie di trasporto comuni che creano un'interazione a volte fastidiosissima, gestione dei debiti perfetta.

Un gioco che non invecchia mai, anzi andrebbe preso ad esempio per la profondità che restituisce a fronte di un corpo di regole affatto complicato.

I played this once, and I won it, so don't call me a sore loser when I say this sucks.  If it were fun, it wouldn't suck, but it lacks fun.  It lacks theme.  It's so un-fun that it's a black hole sucking the joy out of everything around it.  If you are the next table over from a group playing Brass, your game isn't going to be as fun.  Just pick up your game and move. 

If you think this is "fun," you probably think Mr. Spock is a wild and crazy guy!

But you know what would make this game fun?  Dinosaurs.  If they were carrying laser guns and flying space ships, this game would be incredible.  But you see, dinosaurs do those kind of things.  Unfortunately, this game has no dinosaurs.  Maybe an expansion will take care of that deficiency.

One can only hope.

+ Every decision has implications for the rest of the game; Shockingly deep strategy that needs to be adapted for the given scenario makes for a brain-burning good time.
- Long and dense games are definitely not for everyone.


Why it's previously-owned:
While I enjoy long and admittedly-tedious economic games, I don't have a lot of friends who do as well.  Since I like other games with more flash than this one, I expect that we'll play those ones instead and this one would have just collected dust.

I love the theme and the mechanics are fresh enough. The cards dictate strategy, but there are always enough options open. There are never enough actions to do what you want, which makes the game exciting. The rules are not as intuitive as I would have liked. The best strategic option does not always correspond to the theme, which is unfortunate.

Many decisions to take and the route to making good future decisions is unclear to me after one game. I was taught the game rather than read the June 2007 rules, but there is alot to take in. An exciting release to look forward to in Essen. Initial rating 8, than could raise to 9.

A fun game!  I rather like how there is a clear sense of progression and development as the game plays out.  I can see some potential for lockout/screwage, but since I have yet to see someone really suffer from it I don't think it's a big problem (if a problem at all).

9/04/13 - Upgraded from 8 to 9.  I love this game!  The cards drive your strategy but they're still flexible enough not to pigeonhole you.  I really like how the game plays out.  Plus, it's not too onerous to teach and playing time is usually not too high.  An excellent game!

In Brass, the game is divided into 2 phases, the canal phase and the railway phase.  In each of the phase, players can build coal mines, iron mines, shipyards, ports and cotton mills.  In the canal phase, players are able to build canals routes while during the railway phase, players are able to build railway routes.  Besides players can develop their their tiles so that they can accelerate their construction.

When players build cotton mills and ports, they can try to sell cotton making use of each other.  When players build coal or iron mines, players can try to sell them to the market or to use materials to for other purposes.  After ports are used and cotton mills are sold, players earn money and victory points.  Similarly when coal / iron mines are dried out, money and victory points are earned too.  Shipyards offer money and victory points after they are built.  Players can also take loans from the bank.

Good points: It is a great game.  Players can employ different strategies to win the game.  Players can build many canal / railway routes to gain victory points, or build cottons mills and ports to sell cotton to gain money and victory points.  Players can save up enough money to build shipyards which players would be able to have a huge jump in voctory points.

Bad points: Experienced players have an upper hand in the game.  They will be able to know which industry they should build first to get an upper hand.  The game also depends on the cards players drew to guarantee their win.

This is one of the "funnest" game I have ever played. Imagining myself playing this with 3 other dedicated people makes me have goose-pimples, as it were.
It's the system... I just don't notice time when I play this game; it's the system... it has limitless possibilities for future games.
The cards provide the replayability (helped along by the Distant Market tiles). They give a surprising amount of flexibility without determining your play (opposite in Race for the Galaxy).
The demand and space of the board changes with each game according to what, in what proportion, and when industry tiles are being played; every game has a different narrative.
And the "coopitition" is amazing!
Brass provides all of this and more with so few components. [b]Brilliant game!!![/b]

It took a fair amount of time for me to wrap my head around what the possibilities really are in the game, but once I did the player interaction dynamics became really fascinating. It's very unique and different than other Euro/Economic hybrid games. 

The only other game like Brass, of course, is Age of Industry (essentially the same game system implemented in a different way). Some of the unique Brass quirks are the more restrictive city cards, the canal/rail phases, and the income bands. All of these along with the very good base map of Brass make it a strong contender for being the best entry in the Brass/AoI system--especially the canal/rail breakup.

However, I like the variability offered by AoI's multiple alternative maps as well as its usage of ships, making coal/iron the same, and opening up cards into regional cards. AoI clicks with me a lot more and just makes me want to play it quite a bit more than I would like to play Brass.

Bought this game on a whim with some suggestions from other people, and I haven't been disappointed.  It's definitely fiddly and can take a very long time with new players, but it's got a great feel of playing the economic game, building a VP and income engine, a variety of viable strategies, and a ton of player interaction that really wouldn't be expected for a Euro of this type.  A lot more than Terra Mystica, for example.

Components are nice, even if the visuals are a bit dated.

2-4(3,4)

Still 2p variant only. I think I could play this over and over. It's a bit fiddly (delivery / connection rules, keeping track of spending, etc.), but you get the hang of it. The cleverness of all the available options and how they fit together (there are no "fallback" options ... even taking loans could be a strong play). There are certain guidelines (it's really nice to have coal out, and to have developed through your chaff by the end of canals) but otherwise you have to be very reactive and clever to respond to the ebbs and flows of demand. Especially in things like ensuring that the coal or iron you put out there won't help your opponent!

I don't enjoy lots of multiplayer games with two because the negotiation elements become zero-sum and flattens the strategy (Small World is an example here), but with Brass it doesn't, somehow, feel that way. It feels like Wallace has turned the very clever trick of making these sorts of decisions mutually beneficial and it's up to each player to individually consider who benefits best. Great economic game.

Fantastic game! Martin Wallace's best by far. I don't usually like games that rely on cards but there is plenty of flexibility in this game so there is minimal luck factor with the cards. My only minor complaints are that it has a few weird quirks and the quality of the money is not good. It's not designed for 2 players but there is a good variant on BGG that works well. boardgamegeek.com/filepage/30555/variant-rules-2-player-game

There are several similarities between Brass and Age of Steam - the building of networks, the shipping of goods, loans and a frequently changing turn order.  However, the two games are actually very different.  Brass has a more forgiving economy and balances network building against industrial development. The cards work nicely to bring a bit of focus to players' turns and to reduce their options to manageable proportions.  

Brass seems highly thematic. However, there are a few oddities.  Like iron not needing to be shipped by rail, railways needing no iron to be built, and there being no money to be earned in the transport business.  Several rules feel like patches to fix things that didn't quite work in game terms.

The rules might be the worst set that Warfrog has produced, with the main body lacking both clarity and detail, and then a reference section adding more rules and the missing details.  Combine this with lots of niggly exceptions and some novel systems, and this game has a pronounced learning curve.  I haven't managed to get this game to table with any regularity, so that curve has been slogged up each time.  What has become apparent over a few plays is that the kinder economy of Brass (compared to Age of Steam) has been achieved at some cost to variability.

We had one rule wrong in our first play which resulted in players having a lot of money so we missed the money is tight aspect of the game. Brass has a lot of interaction and it is not as complex as I thought it would be (yet it has a lot of minor rules and a really badly written rulebook). It really is a great economic/network building game. The cards add a small hand management element as they limit your building options. The game is not luck-free but it IS less random than Railways of the World for example. All in all a very competitive game with a nice economy system.

Update: Dropped to 7 again. Doesn't get played very much anymore.
Update: This is one of those games where I think about all sorts of different strategies for days after a game, but then really struggle to come up with a coherent plan during play. Having resolved a couple of rules issues (fingers crossed. But all the answers are there in the rulebook folks) I have raised my rating from a 7 to a 9. It really is a challenge to keep on top of the possibilities, while watching what your opponents are up to and avoiding wasting a single action. My initial issue with the rather arbitrary nature of the cards and distant market track has disappeared. They ensure flexibility and variety in play.

Difficult to rate at this stage as it is testing my tolerance threshold for the amount of "stuff going on" I can face at any one time. At this point I cannot tell whether all the options and limitations feel valid, or some are just a superficial distraction. Plus there still seems to be the odd minor rule misunderstanding we need to iron out. Anyway I will say it is definitely a good game with lots of planning and strategic positioning, combined with tactical choices and interaction. It could well be a great game.

RATING: 9
April 2012:  I have played a number of "gamers' games," which are so complex in rules and/or gameplay and/or theme that they clearly have very limited appeal to the general public and/or the casual, occasional gamer.

As I see it, Brass plays as a HARDCORE gamers' game, essentially at the top of the gamers' game perch, up there with Goa.

With Brass, I find it slightly amusing to consider just how awful Brass would play if an innocent, unsuspecting person bought it at the local game store, brought it home, tried to make heads or tails of the convoluted (though logical) rules, then played a first game with ALL first time Brass players. What a bleeping disaster!   And so, my first game of Brass would have been a discouraging experience had I not first watched the BGG video on it, AND played with 3 experienced Brass gamers. 

So then...why is Brass...well...good? As a euro gamer I am actually VERY impressed with Brass.

Brass is good because Wallace has managed to design a complex game, presenting a complex gaming challenge, with multiple layers of competition and cooperation, on a spatially very interesting board, that is very deeply imbued with his historical theme.

And if you suspend your desire for "mechanics fireworks"...there are, in fact, some very interesting mechanics used in Brass. The turn order being determined by the amount of money spent is quite interesting to think about. The income track is non-linear, which I found to be mysteriously interesting...clearly the product of a lot of play testing. The tile flipping mechanism is interesting enough...something to consider constantly in the game...though incredibly fiddly for the first time gamer.

But...it was the card play mechanism that I found most interesting in Brass...you play two...then draw 2...then have a wonderful "endgame feeling" of eventually dropping your hand down from 8 cards to zero, two cards at a time. That "endgame mechanism" really worked for me, particularly with the announced warning of..."no loans in the final four rounds"... creating very interesting Power Grid type money challenges.

In fact, the whole card aspect of Brass really worked for me last night...though I wonder if I was lucky and had some good card draws, and in future plays, I might curse the card mechanism. I wonder.

Lastly, the closeness of the scores in my game, with each one of us pursuing different approaches and strategies, clearly shows an incredibly well tested game. Amazing how close those scores were. Happy to take the win on my first play!  

Giving this an 8 of 10.

November 2012:  After several more plays, somewhat grudgingly, I must concede that Brass deserves a 9...it is that well designed, and interesting to play, for gamers like me.

Raising it to a 9 of 10.

What an original game !

The relationship between the different "resources" of the game (cotton, coal, steel, money, victory points) give the player a lot of interesting choices to make.

Furthermore, another level of inter relations appears between the players because the industries they build may be used by everyone (coal, steel, canals or rails, ports).

Even the cities you choose to build in will affect the value in points of the canals/rails links that connect to it.

Another interesting aspect is the change between the 2 eras when canals disappear and railways start to be built. The industries of greater technology stay on the board and the lower tech buildings disappear.  The result is that you have to plan to establish level 2 tech buildings before the rail era as they will serve as a base for your development for the second half of the game.

A great game and it has a superb 2 player variant here on BGG.

Bastantes partidas no registradas.

Para mí, sin duda, el mejor juego de Martin Wallace de todos los que he probado.
Absolutamente redondo. Todo encaja como en un reloj suizo. Las cartas le dan un sabor muy bueno y hacen cada partida diferente. Para nada se hace repetitivo, cada partida es un reto y las mecánicas me encajan con el tema. No me parece ni mucho menos tan abstracto como otros eurogames.

En cada nueva partida la sigo disfrutando como la primera y eso que ya he jugado bastantes.
Su número óptimo son 4 jugadores, siendo la variante a 2 jugadores simplemente un sucedáneo para poder jugarlo a menos. Me gusta incluso su estética que es ciertamente particular.

Aunque el autor ha tratado de replicar el mecanismo con su Age of Industry para tratar de crear una serie (a la Age of Steam) no ha sido capaz de conseguirlo. Y esa es la prueba de que diseños como este ocurren una vez y dependen tanto del buen hacer del autor como de la pura suerte.

Un clásico.

Oct 2012 update: Playing this further, I'm liking the game more.  The excellent two-player variant helps, but so also does some further understanding of the thematic reasons behind some of the rules.  Points are prestige, which is some sort of representation of long-term income potential and/or influence in society (i.e. you're trying to be knighted).  Iron is not iron ore but a one-time infusion of machinery, engines, locomotives, etc., which is why it doesn't need to be transported like coal.  The game is still a bit too abstract, and a bit overcomplicated, but underneath that is a good game.

2009 comment: Every time I play this game I am less impressed.  It's an abstract victory point collection game with a fairly thin economic theme.  This is not fatal, but with the numerous exceptions to the rules, it's a game that's both overlong and not as much fun as many other economic games.

This game has some of the worst rules, ever. The rulebook, even in reformatted form, is horrible. Getting past that, the game isn't terribly hard, though even with streamlined rules summaries the 20-odd exceptions to the rules make remembering everything a little tedious, especially in the first playthrough.

Overall, though, it's a strong and interesting economic engine/train game; I think it's well done, though it has just a little too much private information and randomness via the cards for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This Wallace title is a return to the Age of Steam style economic engine game.  The play consists of building up cotton mills, coal mines, harbors and ship yards to earn points at 2 scoring points.  Game play is quite straight forward, but it will take a round or two to get your head around it.  Once it clicks though, the game play is actually quite fast.  The mechanics work well together.  Player interaction is limited to interaction on the board (vs directly between players) similar in feel to Age of Steam.  Unlike age of Steam though - this game is not about connections - its about building your industry in the best places.  The connections are secondary (but still important).  The only draw backs I see is the somewhat ackward clearing of the boardduring the transition from canal to rail (1st period to 2nd period)  and the odd 'teleporting' steel vs 'railcar' coal.  Game length (shorter than Age of Steam) is just about perfect for the game's depth.  Easy recommendation.

It's like Age of Steam meets Power Grid, but better than both. I think this game will really shine when all the players have played it a few times and really understand how the mechanics work together as well as how to anticipate the shift from the canal age to the rail age. I most love the "coopetition" aspect of the market. First game by Wallace that really piqued my interest; now I am done for. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.1
Not an incredibly complex game, but there are a few details to the rules that you'll need to pay special attention to. But this is the best of the Wallace games I've tried so far; a tight economic race through two periods (Canal and Rail) of the Industrial Revolution in England, with lots of decisions, a lot of elegant tracking mechanics, and a satisfying tactile feel when you move iron and coal cubes around, or flip tiles to score them at their highest potential. Components are probably not the highest quality, but I still found them aesthetically satisfying, in particular the cards. Masterful, a game I'll be able to explore strategically across many plays, assuming I can get the players.

Two years and many plays later, it still hits the table just about every week. That pretty much says it all.

I'm finding that the number of different possible strategies that can lead to victory is rather larger than I thought. My only slight concern is that the initial turn order in the very first turn can have some influence on the game. Developments are essential, and I never know very well what to do when I play last and subsequently find myself without access to cheap iron.

Automobile from Martin Wallace was my favourite economic board game, until I played this. Supply and demand is handled so elegantly, and the game is just tightly designed all around - Having to well and truly ponder over whether to allow your opponent's tiles to flip so that you can flip your own is a beautiful agony and really brings a proper economic sensibility to the game. Having such a flavoursome theme doesn't hurt either. The more I play it, the more I like it. Utter brilliance.

Edit: Back up to ten. It's just so damn good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
EDIT: After a few plays,  now upgraded to 10.  Not much to criticise here - tiles are fiddly to set up,  but only take 60 seconds, virtual link is odd, but I don't build shipyards anyway,  so no big deal.  2-player variant is excellent - I'm getting a much better feel for the game, and I really like it.

The rules aren't as bad as many portray - there are a few oddities, and missing/ignoring them for the first play or two isn't going to spoil the game.

And what a game!  Ever-present delicious agony of wanting to perform at least 4 actions per turn,  and usually in several different orders.

I'd prefer it to be slightly faster, so may well break out a timer next time,  if only to encourage players on a bit.

after one face to face and several online games at orderofthehammer.com Im still somewhat confused by Brass.  It's an economic game where the winner is usually person whose company is in debt, and the last place player is often the person making the most money.

It is clearly a game of skill and strategy with an engaging theme and lots of depth to explore.

Kb. fél évet vártam rá, hogy kipróbáljam ezt a játékot. Többen is mondták, hogy a szabályt elolvasva inkább félretették, emiatt kicsit féltem tőle. De annyira nem ijesztő a rendszere, inkább az a baj, hogy nagyon rosszul van megírva. Ami sajnálatos egy ilyen jó játék esetén.
A játék tele van kivételekkel, mintha folyamatosan lett volna javítgatva az alapmechanizmus. Vagy talán a valóságot akarta a szerző minél élethűbben modellezni. Tetszik a 3 féle termék teljesen eltérő mechanizmusa. A kikötőben vásárolt szén/acél kicsit a Power Gridre emlékeztet. Amire nagyon érdemes odafigyelni, az a sajátos hitelfelvételi mód, ami szerintem elég nagy taktikázási lehetőségeket rejt magában.
Mindjárt az első játékunkban előfordult az az állítólag ritka eset, hogy teljesen elfogyott a szén, így muszáj volt felülépíteni egy épületet.
A szerencsefaktor a kártyák húzásánál végig jelen van a játékban (a 2 kártyás szuperakció enyhít talán a szerencse szerepén) és a pamuteladásnál pedig még hangsúlyosabban jelenik meg. De ennyi belefér szerintem.
Összességében jó játék, de több játék kell, hogy jól megismerje az ember.
Egyébként tökéletesen nyelvfüggetlen.

M.Wallace jatekainak egyik ekkove. 
A jatek megkoveteli az elore tervezest, es annak tudatos vegrehajtasat. Ad hoc otlettol vezerelt lepesek nem igazan vezetnek eredmenyre. Sok mindenre figyelni kell.
A jatek szabalya hosszu, osszetett, es itt tenyleg minden reszlet nagyon fontos. A jatekido egy kicsit hosszu (annak ellenere, hogy teljesen lekoti a jatekosokat es igy hamar elrepul a kozel 3 ora).  A szerencse szerepe nem tul jelentos, de ketsegtelnul jelen van. (egy jokor huzott varos kartya „aranyat” erhet. A szerzo probalta tompitani a szerencse szerepet a „2 db kartya - barmilyen kartya” lehetoseggel, de az igy elmarado masodik akcio nagy hatrany!) 
A jatek tartozekai jo minoseguek - talan a kartyak lehetnenek egy kicsit "kartyabbak". (bosszanto a csatornajelzes lehagyasa az "1" szintu hajokrol! - Warfrog kiadas)
Kezdo jatekosoknak nem ajanlott, gyakorlottabbak szamara viszont szinte kotelezo darab.
Osszefoglalva: egy kemeny agymunkat igenylo, hosszu, de nagyon tartalmas jatek, leginkabb 4 jatekos szamara.

First time playing the game.  I really like it.  The game is very unique to me because I think this is the only game that I actually don't feel bad when my opponents take my resources or when I flip their industries that give them points and income.  It has a very unique cooperative feel.  It is very evocative of its theme and I really feel like I was building up Lancashire with my friends, yet competing against them.  It is fun analyzing the board to see which market (links, coal, iron, cotton, ports) is there for me to take advantage on.  It is cool to provide that service to my opponents and be rewarded for them.  I like the 2 eras which give very distinct feels.  I think the rules certainly could have been more streamlined like Age of Steam but I think those extra exceptions are worth it.  The rules are actually intuitive, the teacher just has to make sure to give the thematic reason for the rules.  It helps a lot on remembering the rules.  Obviously, having printed player aids for everyone helps a lot.  Thanks to BGG I was able to have a very successful first game playing Brass.   I really like this game so far and really want to play it again a lot.

Difficult to rate a game that you do not understand.  After playing Age of Industry, I had a feeling I had not really understood the game.  This has been even worse here.  It is just too complex, full of exceptions, and anti-intuitive.  Anti-elegant.  Actions and behaviours of buildings do not seem to make any sense (totally opposite to other Wallace games, like Automobile).  I understand that people find it very challenging (surely it is), but I just do not need this, it just makes me feel like an idiot.

A good looking game with a very nice theme but a bit too one-dimensional for me. I'm not sure there is much to explore here with the space for different approaches being very limited. Players basically are doing same things each other with timing being probably a main factor to tell scores apart (timing or received gifts).

One needs some plays to fully grasp and appreciate this game.It seems that players co-depend on each other but also compete.It also seems that resources are scarce but you must also plan ahead in surely spending all of them.Weird mechanisms,classic Wallace.The graphic design could be better,to depict the rules on the tiles and on the board. 

after some plays: An excellent overall game with strategies that you will discover for some time and sweetspot balances. Replayability top.

What a beast of a game! After one play I was astonished by the elegance of the design, and how every rule fits and everything flows together (I don't mind the few exceptions: they're annoying to explain to first timers, but everything clicks quite naturally).
It is a brainburning and immersive experience, driven by cards that dictate play without being so dominant: with a hand of 8 cards you can "see" 4 turns in the future, and with only one of the actions that stick to the cards, you have plentiful of options for playing or dumping cards.
What amazes me the most, is the elegance of the demand and offer built in the system, together with the set of incentives to build canals/rails (knowing that other can benefit before you...). In addition, I love the two eras, with the first being just a preparation step for the second...
Can't wait to play it again!

RATING: 6
a good meaty game, but one that doesn't readily appeal to everyone... first game took us 3 hours. it is obviously a game that needs experienced players for full enjoyment. first half of the game is over very quickly without much time to get anything done, but things pick up speed greatly in the second half.  be aware it will be harder to find opponents for this than stuff like age of steam - this is pretty dry, optimize-every-move-all-the-way type of game, the only exciment likely from the optimization itself, not from building/exploring/growing - not from the experience of just playing so to speak.

I waited until I had a few plays under my belt before deciding my rating. Too many times I get a first blush of excitement for a game only to cool off after a few more plays. Well there has so far been no cooling off for this one. My first Martin Wallace game and currently my absolute favorite game. The mechanics are engaging, the theme is interesting enough, and the depth of strategy ensures so much replayability. 

In short, Brass is my kind of game.

Initial Impression: Another wonderful economic game from Martin Wallace. There are definite layers of strategy to this game which will take repeated plays to explore. My one complaint has to do with the theme for the victory points. When constructing a building, you must either select high VP buildings or high income buildings. Why is income not associated with VP?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Martin Wallace made again a very good game. The game plays surprisingly fluent for a game with such a complex set of rules. As mostly you have to watch out for different things, do the right things at the right moment and there's variation in your actions. The only comment could be that your playing on your own, but that's no big issue for me. I have to play it more to change my score, but it might go up in rating.

My score is better now, because I find different ways to win.

The Kickstarter gave me incentive to get a few plays of this in. Brass takes a few games to get a hold of the rules, and then a few more games to get a hold of some of the beginning strategies. Deep and replayable. The supply and demand mechanism is quite good, and flipping tiles is satisfying. There's also a good amount of positive interaction between the players--just try not to leave building/shipping opportunities open to your opponents. 

This game, however, will not be for every play group or gathering, and will be better for a group that can give it consistent plays. For that, I've set my rating at an 8.

Edit, Aug 2017: After playing a few more times it is clear that Brass is simply a great strategy game. The lack of the current version having a good 2 player variant keeps this game from moving to a 9+ game. The new Roxley version could fix that.

I find the cards a little annoying.  Even though I understand that the cards are multi-purpose, such that you can discard non-useful ones for loans and for building Canals/Rails, I disliked drawing certain cards in the Canal stage and not drawing certain cards during the Rail stage.  For some reason, my mind is always fuzzy when I play Brass.  I keep forgetting what causes iron to be added to the board, taken away, etc.

Update: After a few sessions of Brass, the small number of quirky rules have begun to stick to my brain better.  The cards still dictate your options (unless you don't mind spending 2 cards for 1 action), but that can be said of most games that feature cards. 

2nd Update:  Brass has become one of my favorite games, which is surprising since I wasn't that impressed the first few times that I played.     

2-player, 6 plays!
3-player, 27 plays!
4-player, 16 plays!    


[b] Catalonia Map[/b]
During the canal aka "Road" era, play is heavily focused on Barcelona.  I'm not sure it's viable to start elsewhere.  Unfortunately most of the coal mines are located far to the west, which makes coal very expensive during the Rail era.  I do like that there are 3 shipyard locations during the "Road" era.  Interested in more plays.

Update:  I have grown very fond of this map.

A solid game, you are building canals and tracks so it has a train feel to it. I felt the game went on a bit too long. I'm not sure for example that it is necessary to play until every card is spent. Why not end the rounds after the deck is exhausted and everyone gets one last play? Allowing for every card in the hand to be played leads to a lot of analysis paralysis as everyone tries to maximize. This was especially true at the end of the game. Allowing for this variant will remove 30 minutes or more from the game.

First play: Unfortunately played by the wrong rules and so had a strange game but enjoyed it none the less.

Subsequent game: Rules are now under control but the rule book is a lesson in disjointed thought and would benifit from a redraft. Once you get a handle on the game structure, the flow is quite logical, however players must be very disciplined in the way they conduct their moves. Its very easy to get something wrong, miss some available coal, pay too much money, need to retrace your steps, forget to take a card, leave iron on the market, return money to the bank rather than the allocated squares etc etc. Someone who understands the game backwards needs to Police each player vigilantly or too late 2 people have taken their turn and you remember that the income phase was missed.

However hard the struggle the destination is worth the sweat. An excellent game.

I think my rating will rise with more plays.

Great game with an interesting economic progression. The game really evolves as players place industries, form their own networks (as best they can) and how they interact with other players' investments.

Brass es un juego cuyo público objetivo son los amantes de juegos “duros”.

Complejo para ser un euro y frío al principio. Es necesario dedicar la primera partida a entender el reglamento y comenzar con tácticas sencillas como procurar construir industrias que no dependan del carbón al principio de la partida.

El juego funciona bien a 3 o 4 jugadores y existe una variante que permite jugar a 2 que no desmerece.

Deep economic game as only Wallace can make them. Very hard too learn from the rules and a very steep learning curve. But once the game clicked I had a great time playing it. I can even imagine it becoming a quick game if played with experienced players. The cards tend to limit your options but I think that's a good thing. Without the limits the game would be too overwhelming. Different roads to victory seem to be well balanced. Themewise it workes allthough there are some rough edges in there. Esspecially the loans seem very strange. They generate tons of cash and don't really have any downside to them. If you're into deep euros you should definitely give this one a try!

The cards can sometimes be annoying (random), but you usually have enough time to mitigate that and plan ahead properly.  There is some really good gameplay in here, and I am really enjoying this game.

1-10-09:

I've had several games in a row now where the randomness has hurt me.  I'm not convinced this is not due to my own inability to properly plan in these games, but I am docking it a .5 in a pre-emptive strike against a potential oncoming randomness dispute.

Randomness is problematic.  This continues to fall ever so slightly in my opinion.

While the income progression track is interesting, I'd much rather just play Age of Industry.  The regions versus specific location cards stream-line play, and I think the card-drawing mechanic in Age of Industry also makes game-play quicker and also let's you sacrifice an action to increase your options - something I sorely missed in Brass.  Maybe a hardcore Eurogamer would prefer Brass, but as someone who prefers thematic games (but is willing to play Euros), I'd prefer the more steam-lined Age of Industry.

My favorite Industry / Manufacturing game.  I won the first game I played during a gaming convention.  After the canal phase i was in last place, 11 VPs behind the leader because I didn't realize that the canals scored VPs based on the number indusrtries they connect.  The key to winning is using technology to circulate through the low level industries.  Its an excellent game that I believe is forgiving.

2 July 2010:  Played a three player game against Bruce and Bob and won with 204 points.  This was an unusual game because I won with only one rail played in the rail era.  I played over 3 of my counters one coal in the canal era and two ports in the rail era.  I made 36 points on my next to last turn and another 21 points on my last turn.  One of the most satisfying gaming wins I have ever had given that my competition have played the game 50 times to my 10 times and the strategy I choose was unique.

It only takes a minute or two to look things up. If this game offers more with each play, I may like it more than Age of Steam. "If it's not Wallace it's Crap!"

// I'd really like to play this game more, but it's not
one that my wife is remotely interested in, and I haven't
had a ton of opportunities to play it otherwise. There are
certain things in this game that I think could be stream-
lined and things that could be explained better, but it's 
OK overall because at least everyone's on a level playing
field. I don't have many other games in the same category,
which kind of makes me need to play this one even more.

Great 3 player game. 
OK 4 player game.

I enjoy it most when playing with 3. Things are not so tight and people have more freedom to do things.

I enjoy the game, although I do not play it for awhile.

If you do not play it often you'll forget everything :( Well, you know the rules, but you forget how to play it. Its very frustrating.

My second Martin Wallace experience and is as good as my first one (Tinners Trail). 

This is a very good game but not for playing it every day. Our 1st game took 3 hours, maybe 30 minutes of rereading rules and commenting situations of the game. 

Altough, several plays are needed to learn good the game, because the rules are so complex that it's easy to forget them.

I want to repeat soon.

Brass deserves the effort you have to make for learning the rules. It's really good.

* update * 

After several plays not knowing good why you loose so badly against the other players, suddenly your mind clicks and you'll realize that you are in front of a masterpiece.

Only played once so far. Seems like it should go quickly, but took almost 3 hours to play. Seems as if strategy is quite deep, but was only starting to get it at the end. I liked that I didn't get blown out of the water on my first play.

After a dozen or so plays, I think I've grown tired of this game. Too much is focused on the upgrades and being able (cardwise or mapwise) to put them on the board. For a 2.5h euro-ish economic brainburner, I still prefer age of steam.

Enjoyable but complex game.  My buddies are hating me for taking unfathomably long turns in my first game.  The hand management aspect of the game is great.  I also like the economic & victory point systems, and I'm convinced that it can be just as good to build the coal mines & machine shops as it is to get tons of points for building a shipyard.  It certainly helps to have stage 2 buildings on the board when the canal phase ends... if you do, you will have extra "seed" towns from which you can expand in the railroad phase of the game.

A game about the mills, canals, rails and other industrial goings on that took place in the north of England. I've played this a few times now, which has allowed me to learn some of the intricacies of the game. There is a nice change of tack between canals and rails, which gives two game phases with scoring after each. I like the "flip the chit" scoring of buildings giving you income and VP's on the back, with build costs and resources required or provided situated on the front. Brass is a different take on the "connect places up and ship things about" mechanism that games which let you lay track on a board usually come up with.

Very complex game and the trade-offs were too subtle for me to master.  The rules regarding consuming Iron vs. consuming Coal were very confusing. (The rules in general seem overly complex.)  It felt like I was doing much of the work my opponents required to flip their own coal and iron markers, yet some of my markers were hardly used.  This was much more forgiving on my 2nd play with only 3 players total.  I think it would be better to learn this game 3-player.

Good economic game but nothing more. Playing it I didn't have "wow" effect. On the other side it has very clever mechanics (concerning supply demand - iron and coal) and theme (industrial Revolution) sticks to it. I can understand why it is ranked so high on BGG. However on my shelf it would be collecting dust.

This economic themed game is one of Martin Wallace's most interesting additions to the Warfrog line. It recreates the industrialization of Lancashire as players build industries (Cotton Mills, Coal Mines, Iron Foundries, Ports and Shipyards) around which canals then rail lines are networked. Cotton goods are sold and resources (coal, machinery) consumed in the building process which provides both income and victory points. In the end, the most victory points (Prestige) amassed determines the winner with left over money providing a minor bonus.

The card deck portrays either the various industries that can be built or locations in Lancashire which can house them. The play of a card must accompany each action the player wishes to perform: build, develop technology, sell cotton goods, take out loans or construct canal or rail links. The deck is tailored to provide enough cards for eight rounds of play for four players. Each round consists of the play of two cards permitting two actions (except for the first round of the game which is restricted to one card play). Once the deck is exhausted and all players have used all their cards, the initial "Canal Period" ends and victory points are scored and recorded. The deck is reshuffled and a further eight rounds constitutes the "Rail Period" after which a further set of Victory points are determined and added to each player's previous total.

Thus actions are limited (typical of Martin's designs) and deciding how to derive the maximum benefit from those provided each player is the heart of the game. There are a number of different way to accumulate VPs and it will require several playings for players to see the linkages and dynamics that this game provides. It appears that this will be a game best played by players of equivalent talent and experience as it will be very unforgiving toward novices.

The game is well produced, colourful and quite thematic and is one of my favourite Martin Wallace designs. I think it will prove to have considerable staying power and will serve to increase Martin's already strong reputation for thoughtful, thematic and challenging games of strategy.

Edit Note: This game has proven to be one of the strongest multi-player strategy game ever designed. Online play is vigorous and there is also an iPad app available. Of all the games I own I keep coming back to this one.

RATING: 6
Feel I should like this more than I do. It's an economic game, and I like economic games, it's got multiple routes to victory, development - what's not to like?

I think it is the hand management element - I don't know why the cards are even in the game at all, it mostly only matters for about half of the game (the 2nd half) unless you really really want something (eg, boats) and haven't got the right cards to do it at all - then it is just frustration. Add in a bit of co-op/screwage and I just don't have much fun playing it.

Overall, ok - and I've done well in both games I've played, but felt that there were other economic games I've played I much prefer. If others want to play it, I'll play but no desire to own a copy.

Great economic game which core element is about demand and supply. At first a complex game which isn`t easy to grasp. When it all comes clear you will recognize another great design of wallace . The concept that every player can use all player`s tiles is intriguing and evolves a very solid game feeling.

Theme works OK, but plays a bit like an abstract. It has a surprising amount of player interaction. Plays in approx. 2.5 h. It takes a game or 2 to get a clue how to play this game, but it´s really worth the trouble (and the "training" games are still fun).

Oh crap!  I have four coppers and 5 of my 8 cards are ports.  WTH!

I love this game.  This game is played to earn Vps which are figured 2 times.  Both times at the ends of "periods".

The periods are firstly the "canal" period and secondly the "rail" period.  During each of these periods of growth you will spend several cycles called player actions doing one of 5 differing things.  

These 5 activities in each player's cycle will keep you thinking, doing math, and hoping for good cards the next time you get to draw.

It is a very tight game and much easier to play than the rules would let on.

There is plenty of math, enough rules to keep things lively, and luck, and medium leveled player interaction to make this a very intricate and nifty game.

Played at Essen '07.  Another disappointing mediocre euro.  Sure Brass might be interesting as a design project but as a game it's boring.  There just wasn't much fun to be had while you optimize your moves in this convoluted efficiency exercise.  Some Warfrog titles suffer from a lack of good development.  Brass definitely falls into that category.  /pass

Long version and predecessor for Age of Industry, where iron is everywhere and the ships must leave the map after the 1st half of game-play.

Difficult to understand rules, but once you know them the game isn't too hard. One player complained that there was enough opportunity to mess with the other players. I don't know about that, it seems to me there is stuff you can do. I would like to play this more often but the   time it takes to play this game might be an issue.

Brass is a great game. The theme is albeit... dry, but the game is actually quite a bit of fun and forces player interaction as part of many of the more viable strategies. It's difficult to do everything you need to by yourself, and so you have to choose carefully which players to help on their way to victory as you try to push yourself along as well. Great game, and one I would love to see more of.

RATING: 8.5
I can appreciate the game system and the intricate mechanisms. However, to me the game feels more like work than having fun. 
Also it has a lot of fiddly rules and exceptions and often handles similar things slightly differently, which leads to situations where a player ponders a move for some time and after having reached a decision realizes, that this move is impossible due to a certain restriction in the game system. This can lead to a lot of downtime.

So for me, it is definitely not a game for everyday, but one a might play from time to time - in the right mood.

UPDATE: The game really grows on you, if you play it more. 6 -> 7.5 -> 8.5

Rating based on one play.  Not sure what I think of this quite yet -- missed some important scoring details during the rules explanation and got really frustrated during first round scoring, but made huge strides in the second half and came in second.  Would like to play it again soon, before I forget everything I learned in the first game -- I could see the rating going up or down as much as 2 points on this one!

Dans Brass vous allez tenter de fabriquer des filatures de coton, des mines, des canaux, des chemins de fer, des fonderies et autres chantiers navals pour gagner le plus d'argent en essayant de rentabiliser au mieux ces usines. 
A la différence des titres récents de "Warfrog", nul question de combat ici. 
On aura droit a la place a un jeu en deux temps : un premier jeu dans le jeu, consistant a mettre en place les canaux, puis une phase de transport des marchandises : celle de la vapeur ! 
"Brass" est un jeu sans dé, mais le hasard reste présent par l'utilisation de cartes.

This game is close, but not quite there.  I can see the makings of a great game, but the complexity of rules is a little daunting and still not completely clear.  Perhaps with further plays it will be better.  Wish the "get paid every 2 minutes" mechanic could somehow be streamlined. Update: 2nd play was better... still feel like it's just missing a little something to be considered a great game... perhaps in an expansion!

Sep 2011:  Rating of 8 remains fair here.   After more plays I'm starting to get more comfortable with some of the general principles of the game, and am starting to appreciate the manipulation of turn order a little more.

Still, there's a lot more to this game, and I'm taking more loans than I think I should be.  Probably need to get coal down earlier than I have been, although in the last game played I was handed iron opportunities on silver platters and had to take them.

Oh, Martin Wallace, why are you so mean to your fans? Yet another brilliant design, perfectly calibrated, brilliantly executed, and maddeningly frustrating to play. If there is a game that could ever provoke a couple to open divorce proceedings, chances are it was designed by Martin Wallace.

As in all of his games, the number of choices you have in the first turn are daunting, and one bad move early on can ruin you completely. On the other hand, as you play your first game (badly), you begin to realize what you [i]should[/i] have done last turn, and despite your misery you begin to really appreciate the design of the game.

The best part about Brass is that you not only have to start planning from turn one, but you also have to be adaptable. If someone starts to capitalize on the distant markets, build some ports. If someone begins to heavily develop their shipyards, forget about your own shipyards and build an iron foundry to make a quick profit. It really is a great game. You're just miserable for every minute of it.

A real gamers game this one, as we've come to expect from the Warfrog Wallaces, and not for the faint hearted but as fresh and innovative as any of his best - and, while it will take more plays to see if it is amongst them, I am already hopeful.  The now familiar 'build up income/then score victory points' structure is in here, though well disguised, indeed hidden, by the rules.  What marks it as a Wallace and lifts it beyond the norm is the intimate connection with the physical geography - which adds an extra layer (or two) to the game.  I like it and look forward to playing again. Long on first play but we completed the second half of the game in an hour which should mean that the two hours timing on the box isn't far wrong.

This is a fabulous game ... once you get past the rule book. Why wouldn't a game about Cotton Mills, Coal Mines and Ports in 19th Century Lancashire not be an instant hit! Seriously the industrial revolution theme of this game is superb, you really feel like one of those pioneering entrepreneurs rushing to get the best business and do the best deals before one of the competition does.

The mechanic for trading is a little odd at first, but once you get the hang of it the challenge begins. You have to plan ahead, but be flexible enough to react what's going on around you. This might require you to respond to certain cards or lack thereof, but more likely it's about a competitor grabbing the spot you wanted, or you may see that they have a perfect opportunity that you might need to block, or the coal and/or iron market might have suddenly shot up or down.The mechanic for chaging the turn order is excellent and not to be overlooked. 

This game absolutely rewards the time to learn it! Would be a 9.999 if you could play with 5.

UPDATE: The good news: Brass creaked to 5 plays. The bad news: that looks like the end of the line.

UPDATE: And the rating keeps falling ...

I've kind of enjoyed playing Brass; so the rating is unlikely to fall any further, even though I am unlikely to play again. But the nail in Brass's coffin for me was when I realized just how totally, gratuitously opaque the game is; the same problem of wandering, pointless difficulty that Age of Steam had. The game is won on VPs, but those VPs are needlessly abstract. What do VPs represent in this game of the industrial age? Nothing. Not prestige; not earning power; not net worth; nothing. Just one of the perverse effects this has is that cash in hand is worth VPs, but actual earnings are not; so a player with $60 in hand but who is earning nothing has more actual victory points than a player who earns $60 each turn but currently has nothing on hand. Um... Otherwise, this is just an obscure exercise in figuring out whether canals/rails, textile factories, coal mines, or whatever represents a better way to get VPs, with absolutely no way to get an intuitive handle on it. You just have to get out the spreadsheet and crunch the numbers, which of course incidentally results in endless, painful downtime. It's not a game about shipping textiles, digging up coal in Lancashire during the industrial revolution, or anything like that; it's a game about doing complicated optimization math, with a theme that is as thin as any Michael Schacht game.

Anyway, this is a classic Martin Wallace game: clever underlying ideas, but dysfunctional realization (and atrocious rules, not just badly written but also more exceptions and edge cases than actual rules, I think). Give me Container or El Capitan, two economic games that came out at about the same time, over this underdeveloped mess.

UPDATE: Curse you, Martin Wallace. Hire a damn developer already, will you? Yet another bleeping game with good ideas and no polish. I like this better than most of his games, but it's still much to rough. I guess the Martin Wallace groupies will guarantee sales even if he never learns to refine his games. A shame.
---
I enjoyed the first play, but the second was just OK. So the rating slides from 8 to 7. It's fun but a pretty much by-the-numbers Wallace design at this point. The good news is that it seems like a much tighter design than what he usually puts out: the various industries seem ballpark-balanced with respect to each other, and the game plays cleanly, at least by Wallace standards (you still wouldn't mistake this for a professionally designed German offering though).

The downside I think is the length combined with the lack of real game development. Brass is 3 hours and, it seems to me, a somewhat repetitive 3 hours. Also, it's susceptible to being struck down by both analysis paralysis and by mistakes in play by one player giving large windfalls arbitrarily to another. As for development, the game doesn't move along that much, the endgame is pretty similar to the opening game. This combined with the fixed and somewhat restrictive geography and industry mixes may be a problem for replayability. Oh, and despite being a fairly straightforward game, the rules are a mess.

I don't think the downsides are hugely significant, Brass is a pretty clever game system, but I do think the length may ultimately be a problem, and combined with the replayability concerns and high price-point, it's probably a try-before-you-buy for most folks.

Martin Wallace does it again. Another of his games where at the start of the first session you're saying "what the hell's going on here?" and at the end you're saying "got it! Let's try again."

While the game seems kind of clunky and unwieldy at first (there are quite a few odd and unintuitive rules to remember) this one really started to shine once we got the hang of it.  There are several strategies to pursue, with a little tactical maneuvering throughout the game to top it off as you respond to what other players are doing.  

After more plays this one really shines.  Once you get over the hurdle of getting the rules down, it's a really great game.  There are many different ways to go about winning, with plenty of tactical choices to make as you react to the other players' moves.  The mean drawback is that I fear too many people will be put off by the rules before they get to the point of loving the game, meaning I'm not going to get to play this one as much as I'd like!

The only reason Brass isn't higher for me is that Age of Industry has now come along, and will see the majority of play over this.  Still a great game, but Age of Industry is just more streamlined and open-ended for expansion maps to keep things interesting.

Updated 5/14/10.

It took a while, but I think we've finally managed to wrap our heads around this game.  What we've found has been truly awesome.  

Let me get the bad out of the way first: (1) It took five or six games before we played one with all the right rules.  For some reason, I found the rule book impenetrable, and it is certainly not structured in a way that makes it handy as a reference guide. (2) The fiddly and asymmetric rules also feel a bit gamey, and the game is very hard to introduce to a new player (the length doesn't help).  (3) Even if you can get a new player to the table, it's a game that is so open-ended that it's hard for a beginner to know what to do.  When do I build what?  Where do I build?  Does it matter what I build?  Why? 

Now for the good: It's awesome.  The components are great.  The artwork sets the mood appropriately and gameplay is strongly thematic:  I feel like an opportunistic captain of industry.  Although I've been mostly playing with the well-respected two-player variant, I had another taste of the three-player game recently, and the difference is astonishing.  This is not a game meant to be played with less than three (2 is still fun, but it's just not the same).

After so many games, I think there is still the potential for more: I've not yet learned the value of building in certain areas, or when it makes sense to build over my own industries, etc.  But it is already a really incredible, intense game of head-to-head-to-head competition that is right up my alley.

RATING: 5
[7/11/2007] After merely one game, I can't say I'm truly getting the various strategies involved in the game.Yet I'm pretty sure Brass won't ever appeal to me as well as Age of Steam, Princes of the Renaissance or Struggle of Empires. Gameplay just doesn't seem edgy and interactive enough. Pretty dry.

As a result, not that much fun, really. I miss the spark of inspiration I immediately saw in the before-mentioned games.That said, I do want to play it again in order to get a better grip of the strategies involved. But I'm confident it won't ever earn high marks with me.

I personally find Age of Steam's economic model far more interesting as you initially run a deficit and strive to break even. Also, money seems less tight in Brass as the game progresses. 

Also, positional play on the board seems more interesting in AoS than in Brass. More of an exciting race to build the most routes. Also, in AoS you often still can wheedle yourself into a city - albeit at a higher cost - whereas in Brass you might find yourself entirely blocked. Of course, the location cards might help you out here, but that's wholly up to your card draws...

Moreover, the determination of one's turn order seems to me far more interesting in AoS. The auctions really add so much to the game. Brass's expenditure-related turn-order seems far less interesting and I don't really appreciate expenditure manipulation to that end being one of the strategic decisions involved. Just feels fiddly, articificial and lacking true depth to me.

Planning, planning, planning. You need to plan out why you are doing something. Because of how elements interrelate, you need to know how this action you are performing is going to turn into end game points, otherwise, why are you performing it? Very little generates points on it's own. Also, a lot of the generation of points occurs due to an interaction with the interests of others, something you need to be keenly aware of while playing. The canal period and how it interacts with the rail period is a piece of brilliance.

However, this game has all of these little finicky rules that are difficult to remember and get right. That is unfortunate.

The theme is also not my favourite. The industrial revolution, particularly in this area, was about the exploitation and abuse of the lower classes by people with money. The industrial revolution created a class of people who lost their jobs because they were replaced by machines, and then "hired" their children, to work in their cotton mills. "Hired" being a loose term when you tell starving children that they can eat if only they thumbprint and mark an X on this piece of paper they can't read which stipulates how they'll be working their next fifteen years without parole and two paydays a year (with pay being about enough to buy a sandwich). They usually started at around five or six and worked sixteen hour shifts. Sixteen hour shifts? How's that possible. I've seen five year olds, they sleep way too much to do that. Yes, that's why they had to hire adults to beat them when they started to get drowsy. The whole theme is horrific, and is often the case with boardgames, we play as the monsters and act as if they were heroes, erasing the victims from the story.

Awesome stuff going on with quite a bit of hand management and board manuevering.  My favorite aspect of the game is that you want to win, but you also want to try and entice everyone else into helping you flip your buildings.  Such a clever way to give the feeling of working-together.  The Amun-Re style board reset is also very interesting lends a depth to the strategy in an otherwise tactical game.  The rules can be a bit hard to grasp and will definately make you say 'Wait, why can't I do that again?' for the first game, but it quickly falls in place and makes sense.  I think Brass is to Age of Industry much the same way Age of Steam is to Steam --- the 'remake' of both of these games lacks some of the gritty depth that make the games shine brightly.

It is a well crafted, pleasant game of converting money to victory points as efficiently as you can. It just doesn't stand out from the crowd in this genre.

The conversion of money to victory points or more money is too straight forward to make the desicion making tense or interesting.

(11/2017 update). Played again after many years. It clicked this time and didn't feel clunky. I appreciated the canal era as being an opportunity to establish board position. The rail era had none of the issues I had qualms about. upgraded to an 8

(10/4/10 Update) I'm still not convinced about that game. I feel like the canal period is a bit of a waste of time since a) it is only about a third of your score and most of your infrastructure disappears. And the 'network' building in the rail period is oddly inverted. Because rails don't produce income, no one builds them aggressively until they have decent income generated elseways. This seems counter to the concept of your typical network theory where there a positive feedback loop that creates incentive to improve the network to increase the value of the nodes which makes the network more valuable, etc. Instead, the big rail boom at the end - which can account for more the 50% of your score  in that period - is not really valuable as a network but merely as an efficient transformer of money into points.

(Original)I need to play this again at least once to have an adequate take. In the meantime, my impression was that I like what (I think) Wallace is trying to do - meld a supply/demand economic engine to a network building game; kind of Container meets Early Railways - but it feels too clunky. Besides a very quirky ruleset, the gameplay felt just a little too... awkward.

[UPDATE 3/16: While this game has a warm place in my heart, I must confess that fifty-odd times in I am starting to feel a bit burned out on it -- not that I have mastered it by ANY stretch of the imagination. Still a great game, but when you find yourself passing on it in favor of stuff you don't rate a 10, or even a 9, maybe it's time for a little re-think. It will probably pass, but this one's just not hot for me right now.]

:tobacco: :( :) :) :D It's tricky to learn but not as fierce as its reputation. Either the rules were updated before I got it or other people have a much lower tolerance for mediocre rulebooks than I do -- regardless, those who power through will find an incredible experience. The ways in which your actions open up new possibilities for other players that you can extract some benefit from is just boggling, and other games with this mechanic like Caylus can't quite compare (though Caylus is very, very good.)

When it comes to the various niggling exceptions and oddities and special rules on the board, it's best to imagine them explained to you not by Martin Wallace but by the late Craig "Ironhead" Heyward, former NFL running back and liquid soap pitchman, e.g.: "But Ironhead, why do I need canal or rail links to transport coal but not iron?" "Shut up, chump. Coal represents bulk quantities of heavy stuff that must be continually provided to factories in order for them to operate efficiently and iron cubes represent one-time capital investment in relatively easy to transport components like machine tools!" "But Ironhead, why do I never have to pay my loans back?" "Shut up, chump. Loans represent things like stock issues that give you a short-term cash injection at the cost of long-term profitability?" "Ironhead, what's with this thingie?" "That's the virtual link between Liverpool and Birkenhead. It prevents one player from locking everyone else out from building a shipyard in Birkenhead just because they built in Ellesmere Port." "But Ironhead..." "Just play the damn game, fool."

Best with 4, only slightly less wonderful with 3. Haven't tried the 2 player because I rarely get a chance to play two player games and would rather pull out one of my two-player only games.

Wow. This is a game that's being published? I know Martin likes to throw ideas out there, and keep working with them over several games, but everything here seems very underdeveloped. From one readthrough of the rules, I am feeling really bummed out, because my expectations were high. In the liner notes, Martin says: "I wish there was a quick way to make the rules easier to understand, but I've not come up with one yet." Uh-oh. First impression: this one needed more time in the oven.

I've played this game a number of times now and it continues to get better and better.  For an economic game without resources to fight over or auctions to win I find the player interaction very compelling.  The game art is fantastic, invoking the early 1800s.  All components are top notch except the money, but we'd rather use poker chips anyway.  One aspect I enjoy is that no matter whether you play with 3 or 4 players the game is excellent and plays differently.  

I like games with lots of paths to victory and this is certainly a game that fits that bill.  The cards add a dynamic element to the game that will narrow your choices, which are further narrowed down as the board fills up with industries.  I cannot say enough good things about this excellent game.

I've only played twice so far. I tend to enjoy several of Martin Wallace designs, so I had high hopes for Brass. So far, the jury is still out for me. 

The production values are exactly what I'd expect from a Warfrog game. The card quality is just fine, but not equal to some of the high end Euro cards. 

I like the 2 phases of the game (canal and rail). That creates a neat element. Its a bit of a dilemma to build things that are easier, can score now...vs things that are harder but will stay around for the 2nd half of the game.

Taking loans is a LOT less punishing than I expected it to be. It becomes a no-brainer, since there is really not a good way to generate enough income through normal play to remain competitive. I was disappointed in that.

Most disappointing though, is the card play itself. I felt like my hand restricted what I could do on the map to a large degree. Maybe it was lack of imagination, but I found myself in the 2nd half of the game with no cards that I could use to create synergy with the network I'd already created in the first half. It felt like an artificial restriction, and I had a hard time finding a thematic explanation that took away the frustration. 

One of the things I enjoy about Age of Steam is that you can use creativity to do lots of things, pretty much anything you can afford and can think of. Here, the loans cost actions and the cards restrict your building, both changes that I like less than Age of Steam. I realize Brass is its own game, but I rate is a notch below the best Martin Wallace games I've played.

I need to play Brass more to figure out if there is more that I haven't caught onto yet. It fell pretty flat with the local group (in a game where I wasn't present) so may be hard to get on the table.

Brass is a hard game to describe. It's one part economic system, one part hand management, one part cooperation and one part screw job. At the most basic level, players are trying to build industries, and then to use the material produced by those industries up so they can flip the tile over and score points. To use materials, ports are often useful, which are also player determined. Finally, there are shipyards, which are basically like the big buildings in Puerto Rico.

The entire game is driven by a card system that only seems to matter for the last couple of rounds in each half of the game, as you normally have 8 cards to choose from, and they only matter when you're doing one of the five possible actions, building a building. The game is divided into halves, and the first half seems to be mainly about building up a basic infrastructure so you can score beaucoup points in the second portion.

Like many of Martin's games, grokking this out of the gates can be difficult, in particular here because the 3 goods types, Cotton, Coal, and Iron each have different rules associated with how they move and how they are sold. The rules for building industries also vary in a major way depending on whether one is using a location card to build them, or an industry card. So the niggly rules are a hurdle here, probably a solid 1 game hurdle at that, as we were just getting used to them by the end of our first trip to Lancashire.

At its heart though, I think this is a very interesting economic game where different strategies seem viable. The first game was extremely overwhelming because of all the niggly rules and extra subsystems. By the second, things were definitely coming together though, and I was able to pursue an actual strategy in the game. Now, several more games in, the game continues to impress me based on the number of viable strategies.

The key to doing well in Brass is related to real business: you want to be in the under-served market, because everything comes down to getting your buildings flipped. Being the only person in something like coal or iron can mean that other players are forced to flip your buildings for you, which means you can score even more points doing other stuff. Taking loans out can be a powerful way to finance the second half, but it comes at the expense of actions, which could be used by a stingier operator to put up inexpensive buildings, and thus to generate a permanent income which will open up more total building (i.e.: VP generating) actions over the course of the game. I have won using a huge variety of strategies: heavy loan, no loan, rail baron, shipyard centred, &c. Each path seems to be potentially viable depending on what the other players are up to, this is the mark of a great game.

The game seems to also scale well, playing equally well with 3 and 4 players. Vintage Wallace in any case, and a welcome change of pace from his continuous combat-driven releases in recent years. Started at an 8, presently at a 9. My only long-term concern is sameyness.

I have been playing this game on IOS since it was released and was on par with the AI.  I have now played this game once face to face and have stepped up a level.  My high score against the AI over the last few weeeks was approximately 130, in two AI games last night I scored 170+.

However I have got used to the AI taking care of the administration meaning that in the face to face game we made a least one mistake.  The core principles of Brass are easly absorbed but the game reminds me of old edition of Through the Ages it is too easy too miss one detail.

I consider this and Steam some of the best games I've ever played, Martin Wallis has popped up on my radar.  All I now have to do now is schedule a game of Steam or perhaps Ages of Steam.

Your goal in Brass is to build cotton mills, coal mines, iron works, canals, railways, ports, and shipyards, and to have them be used so that they score points. Your choices will be limited by the cards you draw, but not as much as by the plans you make. Lots of interesting detail in the historical Lancashire setting

The rulebook was about as clear to me as if I had tried to read The Aeneid in Latin. That is a bit of an exaggeration but not much. Thanks to the Rahdo video we were able to learn this game. It is probably the hardest game we have learned so far. I do think it was worth the effort. It will probably be a while before we pull this one out again, mostly just due to how long it takes to play (about 4 hours for our first time, and that is for 2 players). I do recommend it for 2 players, especially with the 2 player map that is available for download here on bgg. I hope we can still remember how to play this when hopefully someday we do break it out again.

A euro style game which has the normal 'economic engine' element running through it. Unlike many of euros you do have some amount of influence to pull back a runaway leader. This, combined with the area control element of the game means is has a decent amount of direct player interaction.

Came last (when playing with experienced players) as even though I scored mega points from by rail connections in the second era, I just didn't have the points from the first era to make it (as I neglected getting enough buildings on the board in the first era).

This one surprised me, as I wasn't expecting to enjoy it, but I did. 

13/10/14 - Upgraded to 9. My euro game of choice at the moment.

Way rad, once you figure out what's going on.  The flowchart in the files section proved very useful.  Surprisingly not too hard to learn, though you are almost guaranteed to miss at least one major rule during your first game.  Once you're in, there's a neat, very interactive economic game in place with an interesting setting.  And the stick on sideburns and tiny engine awarded the winner are very nicely done!

Fascinating, complex gaming system.  Really one of the best economic sims out there.  So many wonderful things about this game, but it is a bit heavy and dry for the average player.

RATING: 6
Update: Played a couple more times at the Gathering. Much better when I actually understand what's going on. 6->7. I could see it going to an 8 on additional plays. I still find the card thing a little wonky. And I forget what it's called, but the thing where you can ship cotton to a non-player port and draw a card. That seems both overly complex and random for a game like this.

What was once a steamy love affair has cooled off a bit.  Advanced strategy has you rarely if ever building shipyards.  Then why put them in the game?  Also, having a game go great only to lose to someone overbuilding your iron mine is very disheartening, and I'm hard pressed to think of another good game that has this feature.  I still play occasionally but not very often.

RATING: 9.75
Currently my favorite game. The best implementation of variable turn order that comes to mind, virtually equalizing the effects of incompetent players. The randomness introduced by the cards is negligeable, and essentially equalized by knowledge of the deck and proper hand management. 

EDIT: Online play has convinced me of the strength of the 4 player game. [-]Still prefer 2/3p for f2f on basis of downtime, but it's a very different game. Would still prefer 4p for f2f with experienced players.[/-]

Number of plays is approximate (although very close). Includes online play as of 2010, games logged on completion.  
Number of f2f games: 26
Number of France plays: 17

Setup tip: Deal out individual draw piles to each player and make them keep an individual discard pile next to it.

My first experiences with Brass were not entirely positive. I recognised that there was a lot of 'game' present, but tough explanations, lots of little rules, and unfamiliarity with the concept of logistics hampered my playing pleasure. In the first (now deleted) comment I also thought I recognised a growth aspect in Brass: while there certainly is an element of industry becoming more expensive and yielding more VPs it is far from the core of the game. The core however [i]is[/i] about finding opportunity in an emerging network. As far as I can make out players do not really [i]need[/i] each other; it's just that matters are financially cheaper if you use what others have on offer. But of course there is a catch in that you help the other gain VPs though this cannot really be avoided because of the proximity rules. What I find more difficult to explain / use is overbuilding, but I'm sure that repeated plays will show why it is useful, or even necessary.

In any case, in the years after I played Brass first my understanding of and appreciation for logistics and the like grew, and when I revisited the game at some point I couldn't for the likes of me think of a reason why I [i]wouldn't[/i] like the game. So I forked out cash for a copy, read the rules (understood them perfectly too), played it, and as per expectation great game. My opponents, who remembered an arduous whole, liked it a lot better too. Perhaps due to improved understanding of games in general, but also perhaps due to a smoother and confident explanation. Given the positive sentiment and the enthusiasm in seeing this game hit the table more often the rate has been upgraded, with pleasure, with clear opportunity to be raised further in case the game patterns turn out to be sufficiently diverse.

I find it interesting to also reflect on my altered attitude towards the cards. Long ago I thought the game very dependent on what you got, but that turns out to be not really the case. Only at the very last rounds of either era do you run into constraints, and this might work out to be too much windfall. But I doubt you'd win or lose the game because of this; if scores are close then it really was too close to call, and if scores were wide apart then you did better (or worse) during the game where you had plenty of opportunity.

That all said, I still find the artwork unbelievably yucky, though. Stark, washed-out, all function and no form, and cramped. Perhaps I ought to invest in flat wooden squares to physically raise industries which haven't yet been flipped off the board.

This game just amazes me! How it was possible to invent those mechanics - unbeliveable!

The way player interaction takes place is wonderful - the race for some important spots or the cotton trade are just done beautifully!

For me maybe one of the best games ever - but you need the right people to play with. definitly a game, I would not play with friends suffering from AP!

RATING: 9.5
Very impressed after first play -- excellent economic game.  We spent some time chewing over strategy after the game.  There seem to be a number of potential paths to victory with one's optimal choice probably depending on cards in hand and the actions of the other players.  If I feel this favorably after more plays, Brass could make my top ten.

Edit: second play, with 3 -- still enjoyable, but not as good as with four.  The game may be easier to learn with 3 as there is more time to develop a strategy and less competition for spaces and resources, but it's not as interesting.

I frequently oscillate between this and Steam over which is my favourite Wallace game. The card mechanics are infuriating and brilliant at the same time. You'll casually discard cards at the beginning only to realise near the end that you've made horrible mistakes and entirely missed the point. I also love the way you can build in such illustrious places as Birkenhead and Barrow in Furness. :D

Good solid euro style game by Martin Wallace.  Brass is a must own game for players who like deep euro style games.  The rules are thorough, but could have been better written.  The theme in England with canals and steam locomotive commerce connections is interesting and the game mechanics work well.

RATING: 7.6
Typical Martin Wallace, but I couldn't help feeling like it's over-complicated.

In short, players are building industries with limited resources, with a need to have routes built between the cities.  Building up money quickly is essential because it gets harder to earn later in the game.  Maybe you'll want to take a loan for a short-term gain to build the industries you want?

While I appreciate the use of theme and the feeling of tight decisions each turn, this game just feels a bit too fiddly for my tastes (and the rulebook is needlessly confusing).  Had I discovered it years ago I might have felt differently, but now I know there are other Wallace games that do things better.

I didn't like this one at all on the first play, but subsequently discovered we had a rule incorrect.

I really do enjoy this game.
The real trick is find the people that will enjoy it along with you. It's very strategic: like chess, you need to think more than a few moves ahead, and also think about what you think each player is going to be doing next, so you can coordinate your actions accordingly. It does fall prey to AP (analysis paralysis) a lot of the time. But I find that's okay, because I'm so busy doing it too that I don't notice other people doing it. :)

Very good economics simulation game about market demand and the history of industrial revolution. Play time is too long. Definitely thematic (rules are there for the theme). Rules are fiddly (w/ many exceptions). Bump it to 9/10 because of great educational value on market demand. Still not perfect because strategy becomes stale for casual play.
Not good for 2-players because it breaks the "demand and supply" aspect of the game (even thought it's still pretty fun to play). Random factor actually is quite high.

Another brain burner. For your first time playing be prepared to hear a lot of "You can't do that..." at least until you get the placement rules down (after a play or two). 

After my first few plays I had great respect for this game, there are multiple strategies to win and it is difficult to make a choice that puts you out of the game. There is a slight "luck" aspect to it - but if you are annoyed with it then you are playing too narrow minded - there are enough options to do what you want to do. Until there are not, which means you have tough choices to make.

Highly recommended.

Great game! Deep strategy. Really good theme. Not much of a social game. You need to pay attention. Very engaging. There are a couple of simple strategies that can win the game. But there are also strategies that you really need to think about in order to win. Just fantastic! A 4 player game took about 2.5 hours the first time we played. There were a lot of questions. We went back to the rules several times to make sure we understood. Three of the four players figured it out by the end of the game.

RATING: 8
Bit of a learning curve on this game, but once the mechanics become 2nd nature (they're not that hard), lots of tough decisions to be made. Your card hand and opponent's play will force you to try different strategies each game, so there is no one "killer" strategy. Game scales really well with 3 or 4 players. 3 tends to have a smaller transport network, more wide open map and higher scores, while 4 has networks that build quickly but lots of competition for building real estate and lower scores. 4 is more chaotic but both are fun when you adjust your play accordingly.

Not crazy about the card mechanic; I'm sure it is mostly my fault for not understanding the game well enough to plan around the cards I have but it seems like sometimes you just get dealt a better set of cards than others.

There is some interesting stuff going on but the rules are pretty obtuse and it's not easy to grasp what's going on.  Not a bad game but there are others (including other Wallace games) I'd choose to play instead.

A great economic game with the usual idiosyncratic Martin Wallace rules. It can be difficult to pick up at first since Wallace tries hard to model the particular economy in a particular place at a particular time, but once you get it down it simply works. A better game than Age of Industry mainly due to the canal/rail era split.

BTW this is exhibit number 1 showing how Martin creates systems in service of a theme, unlike Stefan Feld--who seems to create mechanisms just to create mechanisms and then somehow find a theme to hang on them.

Looking forward to the new version--this game deserves a deluxe copy! I have put the original up for trade since I have the new edition preordered.

RATING: 9.3
This is truly an amazing game!

The widespread word is that this is a heavy and hard game, but this judgment must be due to some difficulty interpreting the not so clear rules. I really didn't notice this because the game was shown to me by a player mate and seemed pretty straightforward. In fact, later in the game, was possible to understand how several features combine to work in such an ingenious way.
The game has a little hand managment that is no more than an excuse to push the game foward, but what is really important are the only two actions (per player) allowed on each turn...but there is so much to it!
At first, the resources are very sparse and the actions must be planned and optimised (a bit of AP must be allowed) but later, near the end of the first phase of the game, the buildings and connections created on the board start to work in full swing, selling production to the markets in automatic mode, is like the board suddendly came to life before our eyes and one feel's like he was really creating a new industrial country...brilliant!

3/15/2008: I'm not a big fan of Euro games generally, but I rather enjoyed this one on our first play. I finished last in a three player game (the other two players have played quite a few more Euros than I have, and I made too many sub-optimal moves in the early going), but despite that, I still had some fun. Still wouldn't be my first choice for a game session, but might be a good game to play with my wife, an Economics major! I found the theme interesting as well, and it didn't really feel pasted on - I did feel like I was a budding industrialist vying for supremacy!

Awesome, awesome game!  Wallace nails it again with this wonderful piece of work.  Excellent balance of VPs vs. Income throughout the game.  Lots of choices to make and many ways to earn VPs.  Who cares about the fiddly rules? Once you've overcome that, it's a great game!

Beautiful mechanics. Score can only go up from here. Need to play several more games to see if repetitive strategies are sure wins. Have developed certain tactics over the games I've played though...will play around with more and see if the game is still interesting to me. Fortune certainly favors the aggressive. It may hit a cap at some point in time or it could be a 10....time will tell. Either way, kudos to Martin Wallace for making an intricate masterpiece.

I can definitely recommend the two player variant and map changes. Everything works extremely well. We enjoy it so much that I had a two player board printed on 22x25 paper which we mounted on matboard. (Sure, you can play the two player variant on the regular board by blocking off a couple areas... but having the custom board just for two is awesome.)

Great game.

While I didn't much care for this game on my first play through, I have really come around after giving it another chance.  This is not AoS, or even close.  The interplay/interaction between the players has a unique feel that takes getting used to.  There is an element of cooperation for mutual benefit, but it does not have to be played that way.  It's hard to be cutthroat, since snaking someone's move likely helps them a bit anyway.  However, the play does allow for different styles, which I really like.  It takes some time to make the adjustments that really make this game enjoyable, so give it another chance if you didn't care for it on the first try.

After a couple plays, not impressed. I'm not really sure how much variation there's going to be. It sure seems like building in the center, both in terms of buildings and canals/rails is the way to go, and that building ships should only be done when you're out of options. This is the strategy I used in my second (and hopefully last) game and won handily.

Frankly, this is the worst kind of euro. This game epitomizes the "spreadsheet as a game" criticism that so many euros have come under. It's a bean counting exercise with no interaction between the players. At least in most euros you can use denial as a tactic or form long term strategies. That doesn't even exist here. To add insult to injury the theme is thinly pasted on, and there's unnecessary chrome for one of the locations.

Players are competing to manufacture and transport goods, across the canals and railways of Lancashire, during the industrial revolution.

Initial reaction: Good God, man, these rules are obtuse!
Reaction after one play: Good God, man, this game is great!

Yes, there are a lot of exceptions in the rules. Yes, you'll be looking them up repeatedly, during your first game. Yes, you will make bad decisions during your first game. Yes, it is all worth it.

This is a meaty game, full of tough decisions, diverse strategies, varied paths to victory, and with very little luck involved. The competition isn't as fierce and tight as [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/game/4098]Age of Steam[/url], but it is more forgiving.

Economic money + victory points game with a multitude of ways to get both which all interact with each other via coal and iron resources.
There's the usual tension between pursuing money and when to switch to chasing VPs and all decisions give you a bit of both. It also has a very blatant up-front choice of whether to go heavily into debt to hopefully boost your earnings through the game or to eek out a path on minimal loans.
There is a fair bit of randomness on the card draws which then limit what you can do (unless paying 2 cards for a wild) which usually results in me playing tactically based on what's available now.
Works very well, plays reasonably fast with the right group, there still no obvious best path. I like it a lot.

Continues to be solid, and every time I play, I want to play again right away and try something new. It creates the same itch for me than does Hansa Teutonica, in which a lot depends on what your opponents do on the map (albeit Brass adds a little more luck with the draw of cards). You always want to do everything in this game. 

[November 2015 - 8.7]
Brass is a solid economic and area control game. It's not hard, once you learn how to play, but it's definitely dense with a lot of choices and strategy. You also need a long-term frame of mind as what you do early often sets up what you do later. It may take a game or two to learn, and even after that, the variables are many depending what your opponents do.  I like that in a game -- I'm always learning something new.

RATING: 3.5
I've been wanting to learn Brass for years and years and years.  I finally got the digital game and I have to admit that I am quite disappointed.  I'm sure there is a good game in there, but the rules and theme are so randomly and poorly matched up that it's impossible to keep all the rules straight in my head.  This is one of those cases where the theme actually makes the game more confusing because it mis-communicates how the rules work.  Especially when coupled with the fact that sometimes the theme makes sense and at other times is doesn't at all.

So at first glance (well after putting 3 or 4 hours into the game) I think this game falls into the category of games that rate highly on the BGG but I don't like.  Those where the complexity of rules seem to be half of what people are attracted to.  I like depth of game play, but I want it to be coupled with intuitive rules.

Only one play so far and I liked what I saw. The game felt very similar to Age of Industry (which I have also only played once) to the extent that I can't quite remember the differences between the two.

Brass did feel tighter but never to the extent I was expecting given the games somewhat 'hardcore gamers game' reputation - perhaps the people I was playing with were being kind to me on my first play - although that would be somewhat out of character for them, and I did have one of my steelworks overbuilt by one of them in turn 2.

This latter point was what held my rating back a full point - the overbuilding seems very powerful and whether it is over-powered or not I will only tell from future plays - there may be ways to mitigate against it. The fact that I won despite this and without really knowing what I was doing is perhaps also a slight concern.

I liked this game, but it actually took 4 hours to play our first game. having trouble getting this one to the table again. Need to be persistant and give this one a-go again. Update: Played our second game after almost a year since the first. Made my head hurt. I will play it one more time soon, after that it will get traded if it doesn't get much better. Took 3.5 hours and was a bit too thinky. Hopefully when I play it again it will flow. Another update: Third time is a charm. Much less "thinky". Felt like I had definite goals to accomplish. Still took a solid 3 hours with three players. Should be able to get this one on the table again, but not as often as a shorter game like Tinners Trail. Plenty of meat to this game. Will have to compete with games like Le Harve and Imperial for a 3 hour slot.

RATING: 8
Not sure if I should give it an 7 or an 8 rating? I assume I'll like it even more once I play it again so I'll go with 8 for now.

First of all, despite only 6 pages of actual rules this is not an easy game to learn, teach or play. After one game most things have cleared up but never play I first game without a good player aid, it will help you immensely.

I really liked the ebb and flow of teh game, you start out small and have to decide between building tiles that will go away soon or develop new better ones. Many hard choices. After half the game most of the game board is reset as the rail era begins. Now the game really become competitive and the right cards are crucial but perhaps too important, at least to us newbie players?

All in all a game well worth trying out and one I will return to, but be prepared that it's not as easy as it looks.

I played Brass for the first time. It was the first time playing a game where after being taught the rules I felt dumb for still not knowing what to do. It was a bit intimidating. After the first phase, I was fine, though.

Finicky and demanding, it is all about managing a hand of cards that give cruelly-limited options.  It is difficult to do exactly what you want simply with the cards you're given and the restrictions of the map and building rules.  Compound this by completing only a small piece of your plan each turn and 2-3 other players competing for the same spaces and the game quickly becomes difficult.  It is immensely satisfying to do well in this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Update...After 5 plays over the years, I have to up my rating.  This is a really good game.  It is a brain burner that presents you with a lot of challenging decisions to make.  Do I build, what should I build, where can I build, should I invest, take a loan, build links, etc.   Bumping up from 7 to an 8...and maybe it should be a 9.

While not as good as the hype, I enjoyed playing.  You are placing tiles down based on what kind of cards you have in hand.  Then attempting turn them over either to score money & points.  I'm not sure why this game is called Brass.  There's no brass in this game.  Probably should have been called Iron or Coal.  It feels like the cotton mills are difficult to setup to use correctly. You need ports. If you don't draw any ports or cities w/ports, it is impossible to place them.  And if you are lucky enough to place ports, then someone else can wind up using your ports.  Which isn't bad since you get VPs, but you really want to recoup your cotton mill investment.  I'd like to play a bit more to test out some strategies, but at first glance, this one probably needed just a bit more development to be excellent.  Glad I played, but wouldn't buy it.

RATING: 7
While, I liked this game quite a bit at first, my opinion of it has dimmed over time. Most of the locals are less experienced in the game then me, and I tend to win a large percentage of my total games played. This does not bother me that much, as there are other games where this is also true, but unlike those I am unable to maintain interest and tension when playing with less experienced players. The game instead feels like I am simply going through the motions, performing obvious, easy actions that inevitably result in me winning. 

Now, I still enjoy this game quite a bit when playing with people who are experienced at the game, and I think it is a great game when playing with such people, but the only way I am going to be able to continue to do so is to play it on-line (which is not going to happen), or to play with the locals until they get better (unlikely to happen). So as it stands it is staying in my collection until enough time has passed that I feel like playing it again or I start playing it with more experienced players.

Players are industrialists during the canal/early railway age in the United Kingdom.  Players take turns playing two cards to take two actions.  Actions can be industrialize (build stuff), build canals or railways, borrow money, sell cotton, or do a little R&D.  You're trying to boost your turn to turn income, and build long term victory points, by getting your industry utilized.  A fairly quick and breezy game (our first game took 90 minutes, four players) truly mired in a set of rules determined to make learning the game as difficult as possible.  Part of the problem is the four of five ways to score income/VP each has it's own set of rules, and they seldom intersect.  Bit worried that a screwy hand of cards screws you, too.  I can see this going the way of too many Warfrog games - nod admiringly at it, and never get it off the shelf again.  I did enjoy the game, but the investment in ensuring we play it correctly took around a week.

Another magical game from Wallace, which has been made slightly easier by the re-worked Age of Industry. As with most mid Wallace games, while the rules are simple per say, how to work the different mechanics to your advantage is no simple manner. Once you get it though, it is a superb game. Well worth playing.

RATING: 9
Wonderful game. You have to find a balance of strategy, tactics, and opportunity in the hand you're dealt. The two actions you get per turn are rarely enough to complete the action you want, so gaming the turn order is vital to get turns when you want them.

There's tension and opportunity cost between all of your options: build coal/iron now and take an immediate payoff? build/ship cotton early for the foriegn market, or build up more cotton & ports to bulk ship later? build now, or develop and build more valuable industry next turn... if the space is still available? Burn an industry card that might give you options later, or use a city card that might be your only way into a city you don't expect to use? take loans at the end of the canal age or flip one more tile?

Definitely in my top five.

RATING: 7
I'm no Martin Wallace fanboy, but this is a nice mid-weight econ game.  The cards constrain how many actions you've got and where you can use them, but still give you a fair amount of flexibility.  There's a good degree of indirect interaction between the players, since you can affect the supply & demand of coal/iron, as well as use each other's ports.  The midgame shift, where all the canals & low-level buildings are wiped from the board, is kind of dramatic, but as long as you've played before or have a good idea of what's coming it's not going to really mess with your plans.

Anyway, the unchanging map would probably get boring if I played it a lot, but there's Age of Industry if that ever happens.  There's also some confusion inherent in the rules as you have to check every action to see if you're cheating or not.  (Let's see, I can build this railway here b/c I have a presence in this city, and the coal can come from this mine here over these links to the job site..)  I enjoy brass because it doesn't feel to me like a painful uphill battle to make money (as some games are), but you don't have tons of cash to throw around, either.  It's also constrained to a decent length rather than a huge slog.

An odd duck for me.  I want to love it.  It's smart, thinky, clever, tactical, strategic, plays relatively quick, map, card management, nice theme, and it rewards plays as you go.  Darn it's good, but something is off for me.

I think it has to do with the theme/fun factor.  To me it is presented as an old fashioned economic/industry game that is just too dry for me or others to get excited about.

A simple would you rather:  Would you rather build a farm/city/zoo/train system/castle/city or develop industry?

It took 3 plays to convince me (kind of captain slow I know :)). In the first play I haven't read the rules and we played based only in a friend explanation (we miss 1 or 2 rules), so my first rate was a 6.5

In the second play, and after reading the rules I've looked at it and start seeing some beautiful and yet simple and efective mechanics. My rate went up to a very solid 7.5 since I hadn't found one suitable strategy.

On my 3rd play it went straight to an 8.5 and into my personal TOP 10.

The theme is very interesting and for a euro it fits very well in both canal and rail periods of the game.

4th play - Still very impressed!

After more than 100 plays online it really divides my heart with Age of Steam. Bravo Mr. Wallace! Bravo!

A resource and time management game based in industrial Era England. This game can get a little technical at times (with routes, and requirements), but if you have someone that can easily have this down and explain and re-explain to others it's not a big deal. 

Great game where you put down buildings and upgrade them using funds. Great money and time manager game.

This is a good game, but not one I want to play regularly.  I say it's a good game because the mechanics and the interplay between players is solidly done.  Scoring is a bit fiddly, but otherwise, there's little to complain about with the game itself.  

It presents a fascinating puzzle of sorts as you need to think several turns ahead, but with a variable turn order.  Throw in a random card draw and you will literally feel your brain igniting as you try to suss out how best to use your resources while prepping contingencies in case some butthead decides to block a space.  It's a solid brain burner, for sure.

That being said, Brass is a game I can respect if not particularly enjoy.  While the strategic element is solid and engaging, I found the fun-factor to be absolute zero, and I've played heavier games than this one.  Something about it just felt like an extended academic exercise and less something that I would gather friends around to play.  Admittedly, these are my personal tastes, but I found that for what it accomplishes, similar results can be found in much more streamlined games that also include that fun-factor for me.

Would I play it again?  Sure.  It's a great game.  It's just not something I would pick up myself or suggest to bring to the table.

The mechanic of the game is unique in its own way. Just like your typical Warfrog games, the game rules are a bit confusing, but once you know them, the game is a real gem.

I enjoy the theme, economics are interesting. A little lighter than Wallace's heavy games. Maybe because it's a little more forgiven than the others.

Played two games back to back. Loved the game. Going to buy it at some point.

Played it again for the 3rd time and I feel the same about the game. Just a little expensive, budget is tight. Looking into getting maybe a used copy.

Can't get enough of this game. Always willing to play when I get the occasion. A must have.

Probably the most difficult game I've tried to learn.  Way too long.  Not nearly satisfying enough for me personally. And for the record, I won.  I will stipulate that I learned this game at 2:00 AM at Strategicon from a rather smelly individual and after a couple hours couldn't wait for the game to be over.  (That's a long time to hold your breath after all...)

such an amazing game melding design, mechanics, tension where every single move counts -- you just cannot waste any move, and the choices are brain melting -- when to spend, when to go first, what to build, and loans, loans, loans -- the canal phase is never to be overlooked, producing at least level 2's are so crucial and cotton mills and coal add needed cash to your pocketbook -- a great deal of tension is built into every move, and everything you do has to count , no breathing in this game -- railroads super critical in the second phase and score tons of points, concentrating on ship building alone will not be enough -- the choices of leading off a round or spending lavishly and going last are headaches one has to deal with constantly -- in short, this can be a real brain burner of a game with concentration needed from start to finish, -- just a great great experience of gaming
.........UPDATE....... 03march16 original rating 9.0
.........UPDATE........ 08oct16 ........ having 14 plays of BRASS since my original 9.0 rating ... I have actually upgraded now (9.8) .... and just to re-emphasize how sooo super amazing I find this game ! ... in person, with the right enthusiastic rivals, this is a total gaming experience -- deep, thought provoking, brain melting, table gripping tension .. difficult to learn, with many plays needed to absorb all the moves and rules, but well, well worth all the effort .. a perfect match with the strong coffee pot on the boil ... ACK ... too much pressure, need more coffee !! .... gaming at its finest !!

i like the mechanics in this game, it's so logic related between supply and demand. the best part when the changes of era. canal to rail road. sometimes you are depend on the action card that you hold to thrive. sometimes you sacrifice between developing city or building link (and im suck at that decision, meh). 
it's challenging when you have one player that dominant in selling cotton, they will drain the cotton sell demand cube. and yes, the shipyard are the treasure when other didn't see!

i was blast for my brain to always adapt whit the cards that i have, just to produce the VP. when you play it with 4 player, it's more challenging to thrive. 

well it's very good game, but bcos this duration of game roughly cost 90 to 120 minutes to play. and the rules it's quite confusing to the player that doesn't get what is demand and supply logic (be patient my dear fellow gamers).

A heavy euro with a unique theme.  In the game you will be building Cotton Mills, Ships, Ports, Coal Mines and Iron Works on the various cities on the board where they're allowed to be built.  You will also connect cities with canals or rails.  The objective is to get the most victory points.  VP are attained by having your tiles for the above mentioned industries used which cause them to be flipped and through the routes you have built.  The game takes place over a number of rounds in 2 phases.  Each round you and the other players will take turns discarding two cards form your hand to perform 1 - 2 actions.  These cards can somewhat dictate where or what type of industries can be built which adds an aspect to the hand management.  Between the 2 phases, some of the various industries and all routes will be removed from the game.  In addition, the second phase allows for building multiple industries in the same city by the same player.  The game really opens up and allows you to try and capitalize on the board situation.

There's a [b]lot[/b] more that can be said about the game but if you like heavy euros than this is part of the upper echelon and you would do well to give it a try.  Age of Industry has been released and shares much in common but it's been said that it is a lot easier to learn given that a lot of Brass's little niggly rules have been removed.  Some argue that with the rules that have been lobotomized, a lot of the game's character and charm was also was removed.  I haven't played Age of Industry so I can't really compare at the moment.  If I had to pick something about the game I didn't like, it would be that when the deck runs out and you only have 8 actions left for four  rounds the game really bogs down with people trying to optimize.

I can see why people feel Brass is a good game, but for me it was a bit convoluted. The rules felt unintuitive and required some memorization, this and having to plot moves based on card selecting was distracting. Honestly, for what is a tight playing game, the random card drawing felt at odds.

I have to say, I'm shocked that this game is ranked as high as it is. There's just so many rules, exceptions, and weird situations that are just constantly remind you that you're playing a board game. 

The systems and scoring do work well enough though. The card system does do a good job of limiting your choices, but not enough to really hinder exactly what you want to do.

After about a one year hiatus from Brass, I can say that I actually like it because of its quirkyness. It's a game I can see myself playing once and a while for a long time.

Martin Wallace should go back to designing Waros with quirky themes, like Princes of the Renaissance and Byzantium. Those games work because they have a quirky theme and the typical Wallace quirks in the rules are accepted in such games for "flavour". But when he designs an out-and-out Euro game with no concern for theme, there are inevitable comparisons to other Euro games, and his games are just not as good. Brass is not the near-broken horror that Tempus was but it is still fiddly, non-intuitive and repetitive, and it has no theme. If I have to choose a card-driven area control game, I'd rather play Blue Moon City.

I have probably underrated this game because it is truly a beautiful game that offers an endless amount of strategy and unique mechanics. The reason it is rated lower than other games is because I had this game on the shelf for a long time and it was always appreciated but rarely played. It was always pushed to the side to play a different game. The theme is super dry. I mean its like sitting through an 8am lecture on the Industrial Revolution with a special guest from that era. Its a brain burner and does not really feel like a game that you can enjoy. It is a beautiful and the gameplay itself is brilliant, but it feels like work. Way too dry and setup is probably longer than the game lasts.

RATING: N/A
Heavy economic game from Wallace.  Second edition.  Wallace actually regards [gameid=39351] (slightly more mathy and economic than Brass) as one of his best.  See the [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/257485/brass-2-player-variant]2 player variant[/url].

The bottom line: Brass is not for the faint of heart, given that it requires overcoming the initial hurdle of a somewhat obtuse rulebook. It's not without its faults, and its threshold will simply prove too much for some gamers, especially those who find the rules too complicated, the length too long, and the gameplay too tough to get their head around. But those who enjoy this challenge and are prepared to overcome it will find one of the very best economic games of the modern era. It's a signature Martin Wallace design, where the narrative arc created by the rich historical theme is closely linked to the game's mechanics, and where all the elements come together to produce a very rich and deep experience that features challenging economics, tough decisions, diverse strategies, subtle player interaction, and almost unlimited replayability. If you consider yourself a serious gamer and enjoy economic games, Brass is a quintessential Wallace game absolutely not to be missed.

This is one of those rare games that you not only enjoy, but you also appreciate and marvel at the way that it plays.  The board seems so simple.  The rules seem simple (at least for Martin Wallace).  But the game itself is fascinating to watch and play.  The supply and demand dynamics work beautifully.  Is it fun?  Yes, but cerebral fun.  After this your brain knows that it has had a workout and wants some crunchy light fillers to cool down.  One major gripe: the coins are horrible, cheap little plastic things.  They even feel weird.  Don't let them ruin the game.  Use high quality poker chips.  The game deserves it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Quite heavy on rules, sometimes the mechanics does not stick to the theme very well, or simply put they do not make much of a thematic sense (why steel can be "teleported" anywhere on the map? Steelworks should require a constant iron feed, don't they?!). Still, the mechanics ARE very interesting, and allow unfolding a satisfactory gameplay and rewarding strategic choices. It is deep, tense, and you do feel the sense of accomplishment throughout the game of building your own commercial network and buildings. Player interaction is quite high in a 4p game, and comes mostly from the area control (limited building spaces) / network control (canals and railways routes), partially from resources availability (carbon and iron), indirectly from using the resources / "activating" other player's buildings. I really like the components.. the map is beautiful, the chits comes out easily from cardstock and are durable, the cards are ok too. Still I would have preferred more graphical difference between front and back sides. The plastic money is awful (i.e. same as byzantium, coup). 

The re-playability is super-high due to the random draw of cards. After just one play I do have some concerns about the effective strategies that could be used which are either not well defined (which is a definite plus) or it is maybe more rewarding a balanced approach which eventually might flat-out the game a bit.

I would certainly advise this game to anyone in search for a good medium-heavy euro, with the big plus of an accomplishment feeling (agricola mastered that) that can appeal to more than one. Recommended.

Top 5 game for me.  Desert island game.  I absolutely love this game despite its rough edges. I played about two dozen online games against some real Brass sharks and honed my skills as well as gained a great appreciation for this design. I'm over 30 plays and still captivated by this one. Sure, I'd love a new Brass map but there's tremendous replayability right here; there are always surprises in a Brass game for me.

The first two players should always develop as their action, but after those openings, the gambits begin -- tactical and strategic gambits in terms of going for immediate market-refilling coal/iron works vs taking the tempo in terms of cotton and/or building rail lines. There's a wonderful asymmetry here in terms of industries, and you'll need to pick a path soon enough. That path will inevitably intertwine you with other players, and you'll have to find ways to benefit from each other. I always tell players that you get 31 actions in the game, never more, maybe less (if you combine two into one). One of the fun challenges is using other players' stuff to your advantage. As I love games that rely on reading player incentives, this is heaven for me. When you're ahead of the game, you feel like the smartest guy in your gaming world; when it's the other way 'round, it's a bitter pill but makes you all the more determined to come back the next time. 

As to the game's weak points: the cards can feel like the wind behind you pushing you onward or in your face; the randomness of the foreign market can screw you; the rules are dense, and the Birkenhead exception is exceptionally fiddly. Still, I find it an engrossing play every single time because all those are true for everyone and you're all going to get slowed down in some way. Perhaps there's an odd play when one player benefits more than others, but griping about the cards is just an inexperienced player who hasn't figured out the creativity required to skin the cat a different way. Always have to leave yourself options, or better yet, plan out your turns in advance with the cards you have (admittedly easier done online than on table). 

In addition to different paths for scoring, there's a nasty defensive aspect to the game in hemming players in with their rail networks. I've had more than one game where I couldn't take an action on the last turn of the game b/c I let myself get fenced in. A lot of the game's strategy is predicated on the brilliant turn-order mechanism whereby the player who spent the most amount of money (i.e., you know, [i]did stuff[/i] goes last). So going last, spending the least, and then going first for two turns in a row is S.O.P. at least a couple times a game. Taking loans (described by one expert player as the pit stop of the Brass race) should be carefully planned as a refueling before getting back in the race. Every turn is so damn meaningful, and therein lies the brilliance of this game and its repeated allure. Can you coordinate your 31 better than the other guys?

Now, for me, it took several plays to get adept at it, but I stuck with it because something drew me on. I can easily see some players getting frustrated, blaming the cards and moving on. Alas for them. In summary, this game has a lot to teach a player if he commits himself to it, and rewards the player who's got an eye on what's going to happen next.

Brass provides compelling progression.  Each turn you expand your empire in some fashion, but you have to balance short term rewards with long term investment and economic expansion.  Every game I've played has been tense, and played out vastly different than the previous.  On top of this, the rules are simple enough to grasp in a round or two of play.

That said, here are a few things that may not appeal to people:

Loans: you can reduce your income to take out loans.  A lot of the early game play revolves around this.  I find it tense and compelling, but others could find it obnoxious and frustrating.

Cards: you have to play to the hand you're dealt.  You can't decide "I'm going to go heavy ironworks this game!" You may not get those, and instead have a hand full of harbors.  My strategies change every time as a result.

Artwork: The game art is dull.  I am fine with that, but the muted palette will not appeal to everyone.

Complex, deep, and lots of fun interaction.  It feels like a stand-alone game that brings a unique and fulfilling experience.  I'm still scratching my head on what exactly should be done to help increase my chances for victory.

Like most other Wallace games, there is one clunky element (virtual link) that makes the game slightly "fiddley".  It's a very minor issue - and not near as offensive as others (i.e., the external investment phase in Tinners' Trail).

There are two time periods - each with a slightly different "flavor" of gameplay.  Like Amun Re, it allows certain built items to be carried over to the next "era".

A fresh, unconventional, and probably one of Martin Wallace's very best designs.  Grade: A

Lots of strategy, planning and little luck involved in the best economic game I know. We participate in the development of the Lancashire region and its surroundings during the english industrial revolution, and we have to, in two different periods, maximize our gains in cotton, coal and iron sales, which will only be possible with the construction of routes that will link almost all England! Of course that building a shipyard will help you become the most successful businessman of industries, and for so much investment, much loan will be needed! Sensational with any number of players: 3, 4 or using the map and rules for 2 players.

RATING: 8.5
Like many other Martin Wallace games, Brass feels like a boardgame and history documentary rolled into one. Its mechanics are tightly coupled with its setting, and the game never feels dry. There is an interesting mixture of mechanics that includes route building, engine building, area control, card playing, and even some push-your-luck elements. As a result, there is never a shortage of interesting and difficult decisions to make.

Oddly, even though player turns involve the playing of cards, and I do enjoy card-driven games, the cards feel underutilized in Brass, serving mostly to determine where and what you can build, rather than introducing unique interactions into the game. However, Brass probably didn't need the extra complexity anyway, given the depth that its existing mechanics already provide.

Brass has been on my wish list for a long time.  It is an elegant game with deep strategy.  Cards are drawn but can be used in multiple ways. The early Industrial Age in NW England is apropos to game play.  We were playing the game for the first time so concentrated on the development angle of the game.  Now that I have a sense of the game I can see the possibilities of a great industrial war with opportunities to crush your opponent.

So far I really like this game.  Bank loans are easy so there is not so much money stress, just time stress to get things done.   You can set up cool turns where you get to flip lots of stuff.   Flipping tiles is lots of fun.

The board, artwork and period feel of this game is outstanding.  Much better looking than Tinners Trail.  

Can't wait to play again...

A lot of the game is simple hand management, but deciding what path to take with the cards you have can be very difficult and subtle.  You really just have to be very fluid while still looking ahead where the least competition or most demand will be. There's just something about the whole package that is special.  I really like the symbiotic relationship between players. It feels to me like a lot of love went into this game.  Now that I say that it will probably turn out that Wallace wrote it on a scrap of toilet paper while he was on the pot, but oh well.  

The old-timey graphics are great.  Now if it just had some romance in it like the North and South miniseries or something so I could sell my wife on it.

This highly-strategic game feels unique amongst all of the other games in my collection, not because it introduces any single unique mechanic, but because of its special blend of familiar ones: hand management, track laying, developing technology, laying tiles (buildings) for possible victory points, managing actions and limited money to gain victory points,  There are a few paths to victory, and a lot to think about on and between every turn.  The rules take a while to understand and digest (and the rulebook could have been laid out better), but if you're not afraid of heavy games, this one is one of the best!

Probably my favorite Wallace game south of Age of Steam and Struggle of Empire. It could even top the latter. There are some connection aspects which can play an important role. Then you have to carefully decide your two actions each round. Finally, there is just a bit of hand management which throws in a little luck without tipping the game too much. For such a big game, the mechanics are quite simple, making this what I would call the "lightest heavy Wallace game".

EG Deluxe Edition. Nice and shiny well crafted very heavy good quality metal coins! Also great to have the 2 players map and instructions included! 

I've waited for this game a lot of time. Now I finally get it! My preciousss! No matter how many new board games and board game designers have appeared since Brass first edition: I think this is a  pure gem, a truly masterpiece of game design, and I consider its author, Martin Wallace as one of the best board game designers of all time.
To me, the merit of this game is that it achieves something that is very difficult to do in the boardgaming world: provide a very deep and varied game experience with a very simple set of rules. Here the complexity of gameplay comes from the richness and the variety of decisions players can make, not from an excessive amount of rules, rule exceptions, rule clarifications, etc. 
This, for sure, isn't a game for everybody, nevertheless: is there a game capable to satisfy all gamers, all gaming preferences? I'm pretty sure there's not such thing. Brass is certainly an economic game, in other words, its a game about developing an economic engine in the best possible way to get the most benefit from it. It's a game where is technically impossible for  a player to win by the means of luck, because there are almost no luck elements involved (well, the cards, but a that's a very manageable amount of luck, imo). 

So, not for casual, family kind-of gamers. This one,  seriously speaking, is a gamers game and, in my opinion, one of the bests out there. An authentic beast, a wonderful and profound game experience... What else could I say? I love this one badly, badly!

Brass is anything but an elegant game. There are lots of fiddly and rather unintuitive special rules, and this makes the game very hard to teach to new players who tend to spend their first one or two games just trying to not commit any rules violations. Once you have the rules down, however, Brass is a tough, engaging economic game with various routes to victory. Recommended.

A finely crafted game system which works great, with certain theme but playing it is not a special experience of my taste. This is that type of game that is better by learn from another person rather than striving with the rulebook by your own, since rules are not quite clear in a couple of points.

Wallace Klassiker ist kein Spiel, dessen eigene Dynamik sich einem schnell erschliesst oder sich intuitiv spielen lässt, obwohl die Regeln überschaubar bleiben im beginnenden Industriezeitalter. Aber zu jeder Regel gibt es dann gefühlt eine Ausnahmeregel. Das Kleingedruckte macht KOHLE für Anfänger erst einmal zu einem Lernspiel. Sobald man die beamtischen Regelparagraphen auswendig gelernt hat, dann aber ein individuelles Historien-Werk aus der Feder eines Geschichtslehrers, das verdientermassen seine schrulligen Fans hat. Das Artwork in seiner Mischung aus kargem Garnichts und schönen, feinen 18.Jahrhundert-Illus sind englisch skurril, auch in der Deutschen Ausgabe, die zum Schluss zum Schleuderpreis verkauft wurde.

What a complex little beast this thing is. It's not exactly rules intensive, although there are numerous conditional events. Essentially, we are paying to place various economy simulations on the board of coal, iron, textile, and shipping all flavored on the revolution of canal shipping into rail shipping in England. It is heavily abstracted, but the theme is there if you think about what is going on enough. 

The scoring and the discarding are both key game mechanics that took me most of the game to understand, and I still don't think I have it down. Long term planning in the game is possible, but it requires very careful attention to what cards you discard to use your action. I was far too casual about that aspect and missed its importance.

Many people seem to think that this is a super heavy, dry, cube pusher euro game. 

I have to say I've seen much worse. To me the theme came through just fine and I felt like I had room to maneuver without loosing the game over a single non-optimal move.

Now don't go in expecting "woot, woot" kind of fun but I dislike Powergrid for being too dry and I like Brass.

The thing that bothered me is that the card draw can really screw you if you get unlucky which seems unfitting to the style of game.

Great game! I was almost expecting to enjoy it less, but I really like how all the parts come together to make a rather tense, deep-thinking and engaging game. I love how the building mechanics work, with supply chains and development through older technology types. Again, on paper it didn't read like a game I was going to highly enjoy, but there's honestly nothing bad I can say about Brass. There's a few niggly rules and things here and there that I would rather were developed differently, but overall Brass is a solid game with a good flow. Somewhat difficult to catch up if you are falling behind though, so that can be a problem. But yeah: card play, income, hoping other players will use your industries, etc. I've can't think of another game that handles supply and demand so masterfully. Super solid game!

Martin Wallace is a beast, one of my favorite game designers, and this is his best design bar none. This game is something very special and it stood as my favorite game for years. The interactivity and codependency among players was something I had never experienced before this one. The fact that the canal era is a platform to prepare yourself for the rail era is wonderful. The turn order mechanic is amazing since you can actually manipulate it. The trade offs are always there, you need to build to help yourself but by doing so you might be helping others. Those nail biting decisions are what keep me coming back. 

It is truly a Masterpiece.

Quite interesting but seems to bog down with AP for no apparent reason. I don't think it's all that hard. I would play it again preferably after having read the rules, and only with a group that I know will play fast. There just aren't enough decisions to justify this being a 2 hour game (let alone 4 hours). Loses a point for stupid fiddly rules.

Brass offered a very middle of the road  feel after my first play.  There seems to be a lot of rules, and exceptions built into what is essentially a very straight forward tactical game.  The cards limiting actions seems a little wonky.  It builds upon that constrained feel that limited actions should do alone without benefiting the game play.  In fact it feels as if it makes the game a little too dependent on timely draws to pursue any viable strategy.  In lighter games I like this mechanic of having to manage your hand (Masons, Oregon), but in Brass it just forces the feel that luck may eventually be more of a determinate for winning as anything else.  The ability and flexibility in and of the cards themselves doesn't offer enough variety to allow for the same sort of dynamic clever play as it does in such games as those mentioned above.  I definitely would play this again to iron out my opinion, but from an initial glance it doesn't seem to be one of Wallace's better designs.  And when it comes down to the bottom line this really has a poor time to weight ratio.

Thought it would be a lot harder to explain the rules, but it only took about 10 minutes.  The problem isn't that the game is hard to understand, but it's very hard to figure out what you need to do to stay afloat, if that makes any sense.  The first half dozen turns were a constant struggle to balance your money with what resources other players might want to use.

It's been a long time since I've wanted - NEEDED! - to play a game again after the first run-through.

After a second game, I really understand it now.  I'm still no good, but I enjoy the long-term planning required to play this game well.

Extremely dry.  Do not try this with anyone other than hardcore gamers.  This is one of those "It's rated high because hardcore Euro gamers dominate BGG ratings" games.

Played and didn't like it even though I did reasonably well more by happenstance than skill.

Seems like a game that you need to play a half-dozen times to really figure out relative values and strategies.

Since my one play was not very enjoyable, I won't be investing any more time in this.

Update: Gaming group played it again a year or two later, so I had to join in. Again, I tied for highest VP, simply pursuing a strategy no one else was (as works in most Euro games)  Very samey to other economic Euros. Manipulate cards, $ vs VP, connection elements to maximize VPs. Still dry. Still a few too many mechanisms thrown together. That I did so well without knowing all the efficiencies or gameflow makes me feel it's not as deep as others make it out to be.

Brass was not very good at all, can't imagine playing it again, very plain Jane and I am not seeing any replay-ability in there. The game became very repetitive very quickly.

No much depth at all for the time spent. Okay for one game though.

I bought this from Martin Wallace because I've played and enjoyed previous titles of his. It seemed my type of game (Indonesia, Caylus, PR) and it was.
It is a weighty game, complex enough rules that take quite a bit of getting around for some people. But I think the mechanics in the game work really well together and once you balance out the actions and your options you can really get into the swing of it. What is really good about it as well is that there is no set strategy that you really should use. It is very opportunistic on your turn.

An excellent game. The economy is very subtly balanced so that development and loan actions do pay off by the end of the game so long as you use them wisely. With four players the game is very tight, and you can need to be very careful to ensure the cards don't upset your game too much; with three, the game is easier but then you get more actions and therefore more time and space to really get your economy going.
While there are a fair number of fiddly rules, I find that it's easy enough to remember them based on the underlying theme.
All in all, definitely one of my favourites!

Only a few plays, and I'm very taken. Unfortunate that it took until the release of Automobile for me to play Brass, because I now fear that Wallace's newer game might fail match it.

Homemade 2-player version.

Update: Ten plays of Brass now and it keeps getting better. As a 2-player game, it's a thrilling first-to-blink chess match. Simply outstanding. Potential to be my first 10. 

Update: At least 40 plays now and showing no signs of disenchantment.

Like an amped up version of Canal Mania, has the tight feel of Age of Steam, but not as unforgiving.  Takes a few plays to get a feel for the game engine - when to develop, when to take loans, etc.  One of those games where you finish it and immediately start thinking of all the ways you could have done better/will do better next time.

Martin Wallace has some dedicated fans.  For me, my appreciation started off slow.  I didn't enjoy Age of Steam, or Tempus, or La Strada.  Then, I played Liberte and thought it was great.  Brass is also a great game.  It doesn't feel as heavy as other titles, maybe because it is more forgiving?  It's very dynamic in balancing production, flipping tiles, but then staying on top of upgrading, but at the cost of income, and... well, that sounds a little dull doesn't it?  You really feel like you are building your industries and you have several ways to grow and several things you can concentrate on.  At the same time, the game is fun and doesn't feel like a math optimization exercise.

The components are top notch and this is definitely the best looking title from Warfrog as well.  I'm looking forward to playing this again.

Something about the looks of the board and counters as well as the fact that it has a "canal" age really makes me feel the early industrial age theme of Brass even though the game play itself doesn't.  Brass is a bit chaotic and free flowing at first, then settles into a very interesting middle game followed by a short end game where a bit too much point optimization calculations have to be done.  I like this one a lot but have some slight reservations due to the impact of the card draws to your play options as well as the non-thematic way victory points are calculated.  Very nice game over all.

Brass seems to be at first sight an economical game, and normally, I dont like games of this sort, but Brass is just an amazing eurogame designed for the euro geeks and not for the casual gamers. However it is not really dificult to teach (although the rules are somewhat fiddly and easy to forget) but it is normal that in their first games the players have no clue about the best options to take, and usually they feel overwhelmed by the game. Just try it again, you could end loving it as I did. In my book, this the best of the Martin Wallace´s designs and this is saying a lot. An excellent game that works perfectly with three to four players and has also a very good variant for two players sessions.

Sept 08 - Brass is a fairly heavy Euro.  

What can I say?  I'm a Wallace fan and enjoy his games, most of which contain some very 'unique' mechanics.  Brass is a well-developed game and the two hours for our 3 player game raced by in what felt like 30 mins.  A true sign of a great game.  AP prone players may have a big problem, as there is LOTS of choice.  Gut reaction? 8/10

An exquisitely balanced and deeply strategic network and economy building game. High-level play is a finely-tuned dance of "coopetition". The only downside is that the ruleset is extremely complex, full of little easy-to-forget points, with the game becoming utterly broken by omitting or misplaying even the smallest and fiddliest of little rules. Once all players understand the entire ruleset, though, it is almost unmatched among strategy games. Wallace's masterpiece.

Game seems good after a play, but there's a pretty steep learning curve, I think, and I found the rules were a lot to take in at once.  I REALLY HATE the "invisible connection" between Liverpool and the other city.  The urles for that just add to confusion and, to me, serve little useful purpose.  Additionally, on your first play, I'd likely add an extra 30-60 minutes to the time.

Excellent game. Very strategic, yet thematic as well. So much to think about and prepare for next rounds and period. In first period, canal period, you mostly try to earn and develop as efficient you can and prepare for next period, rail period, when you will have really tough decisions, what to build and where to do that. Much player interaction on map. The only drawback is that cards add some restrictions where to build, but that is very minor. You just have to use your cards as good as you can. Also I recommend to print out some custom player aids.

RATING: 5
I'll caution that I've played just once.  I suspect there's a good game to be found here, but I also suspect it may not be worth the search.  The rules are horribly presented and the goals are opaque and mysterious, at least initially.  I'm confident that things would become clearer with further play, but I'm much less confident that the game provides a tight enough focus for the players.  There's a lot of opportunistic nickle and dime-ing going on, spending time maneuvering around the inscrutable restrictions placed on you by the game system and by your hand of cards.  This maneuvering was kind of a pain in the ass, and nothing I was doing in the game was exciting enough to make the effort pay off.

I think the bottom line on Brass is the same complaint that I've had with pretty much all of Martin Wallace's post-Age of Steam Warfrog games:  too many rules.

And it's not just the quantity of rules that I question. It's the artificial and unexplained nature of many of the rules. While playing, I kept asking myself the questions, "Why is this rule the way it is? Why is this game the way it is?" Why do I need a card to play here? Why does my location card work here but not my industry card? Why is this shipyard worth victory points but not income? Why is this cotton mill worth income but not victory points? Why is my infrastructure suddenly disappearing? Why must I use coal from this source? Why do I want to build my coal mine after people have been using coal from the general supply, but not before? Why is my turn order determined by the amount I spent last turn? Why does my income not count for anything at the end of the game? Why is it so easy for me to take out monstrous loans with almost no penalty? Why does it matter whether a port is flipped or unflipped for some things but not for others? What does that represent? Why do I have to annoy myself and choose a card to discard even when my action does not require a card? Why am I able to draw cards for a location that is inaccessible during this phase of the game?

I guess the point I'm trying to make is that the more ambitious and complex a game is, the more intuitive and coherent its rules and theming need to be. Otherwise, players will have trouble organizing and making sense of all the information. It's a very bad sign when the rule book includes an apology at the end saying something like, "There really is no good way to explain this game."  Wow.

I am not sure why I like this one, it is a little more EURO than my typical favorites. Maybe it is because it is not long like Agricola or Puerto Rico and I still haven't got the strategy down to win yet, so it's very challenging. 
I don't like the mechanic that lets you burn through technologies very much, but I do admit it works well somehow. 
This is very much a game of looking at what your opponents have set you up to do and maximizing your effectiveness based on that, while trying not to leave them set up for a huge play - yet it is not nearly so punishing in that respect as Puerto Rico. I also like being able to take loans without feeling like I am digging my own grave like in some games.

Another ingenious masterwork from Martin Wallace, and a worthy companion design to Age of Steam. It feels a bit less cutthroat than Age of Steam, and more forgiving, too, as your mistakes are paid for with opportunity costs rather than the bankruptcy cash spiral of that other game. Handsome components. The theme is brilliantly realized. From other comments I thought the components would be ugly, the rules a mess, and he card mechanic too random, but found none of these to be the case. The rules are a bit gritty and might have benefited from more development, but there's nothing you can't get down pat here after a single learning game and a post-contest review of the rules.

Another great Wallace. Not as tricky as Age of Steam that is sometimes too much of a brain burner. Just the same Brass is not an easy game. You have to plan carefully. But still you are somehow dependent of the cards you get. Sometimes you're just screwed, so a little less luck influence would have made the game even better. Prepare for a steep learning curve for the first game.

Brass is a very nice game that actually ended up above my initial expectation.  Each player went for a different strategy and we ended up very close to each other at the end of the game and it's always something i like when there are several possible paths to victory.  The theme is not the strongest point of the game but it was okay for me.

8th June 2009: after three plays (two and a half, actually) I rate it 9. Can't stop pondering of how theme is combined with game mechanics and how original the game is itself.

For example, you have five types of industries in the game and every each of them is ruled by different sets of rules. This, on the other hand, is a real PITA when you have to explain all the subtleties but once players get a grip over what is happening in the game, it all goes seamlessly.

13th August 2009: up-rated to 10. There're more games of Brass under my belt than of any other game (mostly on-line, mind you, which I don't register here) but anyway, it only shows how much I like the game. It second best right after Perikles.

7th November: with more than 100 games over my belt (most of it on-line, obviously), it's by far my favourite game. I will never give it up.

December 2013: more than 200 games played.

Great game that is a lot of fun. You pass all the game time thinking in making more brass. 
A lot of decisions to take that makes it a real brain burner. 
You get into the mechanics quickly but you'll need several plays before you play without rule mistakes and a lot more to master it.
Also it fits very well in its theme: it simulates the process of investment - production - need of materials - more investment - more production that carried the industrialization process forward.

I liked the game, but I can't say I'm jonesing to play it again.  It could go up with another play as the game has a lot of potential.  I need to try it again to give it a fair shake.  It had a lot to like, but it seemed really dry and robotic.  I really disliked the card mechanic in the game.  The cards are flexible enough that the only time they matter is when they screw you over - I would have rather seen a more typical turn/timing mechanism and the elimination of the cards.  A lot of the odd little rules seemed to add fiddliness without adding additional interesting decision points.  The technological development part of the game is pretty cool, as is the chrome between the canal phase and the rail phase.  This is another game where every turn you are trying to plan what you are going to do, and you nearly always seem to come up a couple of dollars short or get screwed by another player's actions, so you always need a backup plan.  The boat VPS are huge, but our game was won by players who instead worked on building networks of lesser-scoring buildings and railways.  The game was way too long for what it was.  Why should this take 3 hours?  It could be done in 2 or less and be just as much fun.  We also didn't see any kingmaking, but like many martin wallace designs, it looks to me like one player's mistake might be another player's bounty.  A couple crap moves by one player taken advantage of by the other player could decide the whole thing.  A little arbitrary for a 3 hour game.  The components were unimpressive and overall the game didn't feel like it really had any "take that" element to it, even though we were interacting on the board regularly.  I just didn't have much fun.  An OK Game.  I'll adjust my rating if/when I play it again.

RATING: 9.5
Within a couple of plays, I realized that this is going to be a classic, and a favourite of mine for a long time.  Great replayability and lots of depth.  The only things against it are that you can only play with 3 or 4 players (no 2- or 5-player variants in the official rules at least), and it's hard to explain the game to non-gamers.  But maybe I should score it a 10/10 anyhow.

The hints in the (2nd edition?) rule book are exactly right -- this is a game of supply and demand.  Try to build what other players need.  If there are a lot of cotton mills, build ports, and vice versa.  If there is little coal or iron in the market, build some (and get the monetary bonus for fulfilling the demand).

Money is not as tight as in Age of Steam -- don't be afraid of taking loans to get your economic engine running.

It seems critical to place railroads around big cities (e.g. Manchester) that are likely to fill up with buildings that will get turned over.  This may require taking loans (many loans?) at the right time to allow you to build 2 rails for $15, or maybe 4 rails for $30 in a turn!  For building rails, it's also important to get to go first (if possible) in the rail phase.  In fact, I've seen people choose "loan, loan" as their last two actions in the canal phase to ensure that they have $60 and go first.  Of course, getting enough coal may be a problem if you want to build 4 rails, especially because you need to connect to a port in order to buy from the free market.  If you build coal at the end of the canal phase, other players may use it instead of you... so put it somewhere obscure (like Rochdale).

It's probably too hard to get a shipyard down for only 18 VPs.  Try to get ironworks down instead -- the best one pays out 9 VPs, plus a little income.  And it stops other people from playing ironworks (because there are so few spots on the board for them).  Of course, playing them too early can be a problem -- you could be overbuilt if there is no more iron left on the board.

Useful tip:  develop (discard out of the game) some 1-cost tiles early, and play 2-cost tiles in the canal phase.  This gives you bases to start from in the rail phase, and points that can score twice (once after each phase).

Possibly my favorite game at the time I wrote this. Being the devotee of economic games that I am, I love the way it replicates the give and take of supply and demand. If the players demand iron, building an iron mine is a great play, whereas if shipping is going to be popular, a port is the better play. Furthermore, the things that are demanded change each game. Very replayable, well designed, great game.  I fear I may be on the path to Martin Wallace junkie...

The game plays much better with 4.

RATING: 9
Very interesting connection/economy-building game. However, my first play was after playing a few other games and many players at the table were pretty burnt out, so the game was long, drawn out, and involved a lot of questions (and arguments) about rules.

I can see potential here however. For a game that is very much about developing an economy and then developing a point strategy (e.g., Saint Petersburg), the spatiality of it all, the limitations that your cards place on you, and
the interaction that occurs through others using your buildings and connections make this game much more complex and rich web of interaction. However, this can become paralyzing for folks who have a difficult time formulating distinct, differentiated, and definitely fluid short term and long term goals.

I would gladly play again.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Upate (07/09/2014): After playing a second time, I'm appreciating the game all the more. I still feel as though there are still oh so many exceptions to the rules (e.g., what buildings can and can't be overbuilt, and the conditions under which you can), but I also recognize that the game is designed to only crumble under the most serious of analysis paralysis (as you *only* take up to 2 actions per turn). Furthermore, as I chased an plows-into-plowshares strategy this game, I recognize the ways in which pursuing this 'basic' and typical Euro strategy begins to break down and break down relatively quickly under players who effectively, and frequently draw loans but who stay afloat as well. Ranking 6-->7. Likely to continue climbing.

----------------------------------------------------------
Update September 2015:
There are far more opportunities to cut people in/out of entire economic sectors than I thought (it really is far more than a strict economic game). The tempo is delicious as players jockey and jostle to have the ol' one-two punch (or at least landing that second punch before a player who is encroaching on the same turf reals from the first one). The economic 'band' helps prevent anyone from running away with a lot of cash, keeps the focus on points (across both ages especially) and makes loans a dance rather than a dread. This game goes from good to great with a vicious table.

Very good game. I actually bought this game after having played Age of Industry, which succeeded Brass as a game with same mechanisms and more streamlined rules.

Comparing Age of Industry and Brass, I really think Brass is the better game. The game has been criticized for it's fiddly rules. If you are used to playing some of the typical Euros (e.g. Puerto Rico) you really shouldn't worry- rules are actually very simple.

What I really like about this game is tha balance between short time gain and long term strategy, the fight for the board positions, the supply/demand mechanisms for coal and iron and the interaction with other players. Money is tight, and you need to balance building a certain cash flow and long term strategies. Excellent game - recommended for anybody who enjoys strategic games with some depth. Replay value is very high, as there are several possible winning strategies, leaving you with a desire to try something new next time.

Wow!  This game is amazing.  I love the 2 scoring eras, the hand managment aspect and the subtle cooperation required with your fellow players in order to make your strategy really pay off.

Based on one play- really enjoyed it, although it was pretty difficult to explain to my light gamer friends (as are the rest of Wallace's games)

It's a game that the rules make it seem a lot more daunting than it is, with multiple paths to victory. Development is crucial, and I feel Iron basically never gets used, but maybe this would change on future playthroughs

Build industries in the Lancashire.
Each turn use a card to:
- build an industry if you can pay for it
- create roads/railroads
- produce goods
- ship goods away
... or just take a loan to keep a move on. ;)
It's a bit more subtle than this, but you get the idea.

I don't usually like economic games, especially those with an industrial theme, but in this case I'll make an exception.  Very deep game!  As in real life, I despise loans and the transition from the canal era to the rail era, while thematic, adds unwanted complexity to an already complex game.  Since I don't play those kind of games often, I got rid of it in favor of its streamlined little brother, Age of Industry.  (Used copy from ChuckLinus) (Sold at La Revanche Bazar)

I found Steam too dry and boring but Brass is very cool and oddly thematic. It's a little hard to wrap your head around but the cooperative and interactive economy works really well. I love the interplay of supply and demand here. Some might not like the fact that the board is seeded and there is almost no randomness but I like how it fosters coming into the game with an overarching strategy. Perfect length and complexity. Lots of subtlety and interesting scoring

Best with 3-4 and good with 2-4

I'm glad someone taught this game. I heard the rules were poor, so I was reluctant to get this despite the high ratings. The game mechanics are relatively simple: 1) play two cards--one per action; and when everyone is done, pick up cards and income. Play until all the cards are gone. Brilliant. Yet, the "persistence" rules, building, taking of coal, building canals and tracks, taking of iron, all make for a clumsy game that clocked at 4.5 hours for a game of 4, with 3 newbies. It has a similar feel to Power Grid, Caylus, and the various railroad games that Wallace is famous for. The complexity does not come from the mechanics, but rather the strategy. It took half the game to get a hold of what was going on--it all makes sense. Build coal mines to supply coal for building advanced buildings and tracks. Build iron works to supply iron for development (to race past initial buildings to "choice" buildings with more VPs). Build ports to ship the cotton. Build cotton mills to produce the cotton. If deliveries are established for coal, iron, and cotton, the income goes up (like Railroad Tycoon). Loans up to 30 pounds can be taken as an action, but knock you back accordingly. There are two phases: the canal phase (which is painfully slow), and the rail phase (which is much quicker). Only advanced buildings built during the first phase survive into the second phase, continuing to give VPs. The more advanced the building, including ships, the less income it brings in, but gives correspondingly higher VPs. Income is separate from VPs, although they share the same track (this is a departure from RRT), and VPs are scored only at the end of the two phases. All in all, a complex game, comprising of deceptively simple mechanics. There is a lot of depth here, and I am looking forward to exploring more of that. Initial rating: '8'.

Update (3/29/09): After playing Brass and Le Havre, it seems that Brass makes more sense to me. Le Havre seems like I am playing Agricola, and Agricola currently aggravates me. Brass is more like Power Grid--it just makes more "sense" to me.

Update (08/06/10): Finally got my own copy, sensing that it is about to go OOP, in favor of Age of Industry. This is a fantastic game, although it has a pretty high learning curve in terms of mechanics and strategy, but it is worth it for those looking for a meaty tactical and strategic game.

Update (09/16/10) 5 plays: I keep losing, but keep coming back for more. The game makes me ponder about what mistakes I made, as well as the killer moves I did make. Toying with the Distant Market is a crap shoot, but fills me with glee if I make it. The game is tense, and it is impossible to come up with a plan and stick with it, because other players are always getting in the way, and the cards drawn give new opportunities. There is so much to do, yet so little time to do it in, plus everyone is competing for initiative/turn order, location, and opportunity. There is also plenty of interaction in terms of scoring, as sometimes it is worthwhile, or necessary, to flip over an opponent's industry tile, just to get the iron/coal cheap, or to use the port to ship the cotton. The emotions run high: the highs are exhilarating AND the lows are devastating. This manic-depressive experience keeps me coming back; it is addictive, and it is that good.

Update (11/05/10) 9 plays: Finally winning with cotton mill strategy, but it depends on what everyone else is doing and responding to their actions. One cannot play Brass in a vacuum--the game has one of the highest indirect player interactions I've ever played, since everyone is competing for finite building spaces and limited resources--someone is always getting in the way of another! However, player order manipulation, money management, opportunistic play, adaptability, and long-term planning are key. There is so much meaty play here, sprinkled with a bit of luck of the draw, that this must be board gaming heaven. I am upping this to a '10'.

Update (11/19/10) 12 plays: Definitely requires considerable hand-holding to get newbies past the first game, as the experience will probably make or break it for them. Reading the background in the rulebook was helpful for me to fully understand the intent behind the seemingly bizarre mechanics and rules. Explaining it in the following manner may be helpful in providing context to newbies:

* Coal is straightforward in terms of logistics, as you must have a traceable path back to a source, whether it be a coal mine or a port to access the market. Iron is NOT really the metal, but abstractly represents ideas, technology, progress, or sweat equity, and that is why it is immediately available everywhere on the board. Consider the box cover: there is a man holding up a miniature iron works model, which could conceivably represent the entrepreneurial spirit, and hence iron works are more like "think tanks" rather than something to do with the metal.

* Canals and Level 1 buildings don't really disappear at the end of the canal phase, as their productivity is captured in higher residual income for the rest of the game. Overbuilding is the same as well, as income either remains the same or increases; only the "prestige" or "influence" of the technologically superior industry is represented by the swing in VP.

* Flipping cotton mills and port tiles is equivalent to making cube deliveries in Railroad Tycoon or AOS, as you are not really delivering one cube, but rather establishing a trade route (a supply and demand relationship) that will pay residual income for the rest of the game. The same can be said of coal mines, iron works, and shipyards, as flipping represents maturation of a given industry, and thus comes with residual income.

* The random cards represent business opportunities that pop up all around the board. So, do you have presence or influence in that town for a new startup? Can you get the coal there? How much is it for the next level of technology?

* Loans are somewhat counterintuitive, as you are not paying fixed interest in the traditional sense every turn for some loan amount, but instead you are giving up residual income (and future earnings) as a sort of collateral. It may be helpful to consider loans as capitalization, much like issuing stock, or maybe like a reverse mortgage. Thus, coal mines are actually helpful, because although they provide poor victory points, they have high income, which can later be painlessly converted into loans that allow you to build more valuable industries.

Update (09/17/11): Played a custom Catalan variant, which feels and plays completely differently from the Lancashire board. Highly recommended.

Update (03/09/12) 35 plays: Hadn't played this in nearly five months, but it is still a winner. It is still a '10'.

Update (02/10/13) 43 plays: Let's not beat around the bush: this is a GREAT game from a GREAT designer. I'm now intrigued about what the designer did to make Age of Industry so much more "accessible".

Update (10/18/2013) 46 plays: Played a fan-based variant of French Brass. Different geography, different feel, but still a wonderful experience. Two shipyards allowed during the Canal phase? Count me in!

Update (11/15/13) 48 plays: Put together the PnP [thing=138329]Catalan variant[/thing] and played it. All four of us had forgotten that coal is extremely scarce. The board is evil. Forget all the strategies you've learned on the Lancashire board, because it isn't going to work. Brutal. Loved it. Will start separately recording plays there.

Finally, a game where orphans can dig coal, shovel whatnot into foundries, and spin cotton as Nature intended!  Much like Mr. Brassack's "beehive", the world of the past will crawl into the future on a moving carpet of the unfortunate.  Pick a better uterus next time, kids!

Initial contact was rough, as this comes across as a bog-standard Euro where one grinds nibs to trade for nobs and score dinguses; it was with great joy that I discovered this is really a storytelling game ([i]my favorite kind[/i]), the story of the sprouting and flourishing of the Industrial Revolution in Great Britain.  All those little rules, those teeny-tiny rules everyone forgets to hate, make no sense when taken at face value...  They are chrome, or, if you will, the lint and coal dust that gilds the dim windows of the noisome factories.  Without them you could forget that each Pound Sterling you plunk down lands squarely on someone's bare foot.

One of my favorite games, even if I'm pretty terrible at it. I like the way all the mechanisms work together. I like the flipping-to-score mechanic that requires you to actually find a consumer for the goods you are producing. Too many economic games have unsatisfactory market mechanisms. The built-in supply/demand system is nice.

There is definitely a frustration associated with getting what feels like an "unfair" hand of cards. But everyone else at the table is dealing with the same thing...you just don't know it because you can't see what they've got.

Évekig vártam arra, hogy játszhassak ezzel a híres játékkal. Talán a túlzott elvárások miatt, de nem hozott olyan élményt, mint amilyenre vártam. Nagyon gondolkodtató játék, ami nem lenne baj, de nagyon száraz a játék. Nagyon hosszú minden része, az előkészület, az akciók, az elpakolás, a pontozás minden hosszú, nehézkes. Simán előfordulhat, hogy egy adott körben első vagyok, de sokat költök azért a következő körben utolsó leszek, így pedig rengeteget kell várnom két lépés között. 
A szabály bonyolult, sok a kivétel és külön szabály, ráadásul nem mindegyiket érzem logikusnak. Ahhoz képest, hogy milyen komoly játék, nagy szerepe van egy jókor felhúzott város kártyának, és hiába lehet két kártyával kiváltani, mert akkor meg az elmaradt második akció hiányzik. 
Szóval elsőre nem győzött meg, még próbálkoznom kell, mert sok olyan embernek van van róla jó véleménye, akinek odafigyelek a szavaira.

If ever I had someone I wanted to show what board games can [i]do[/i], I’d choose Brass. It takes familiar elements—income, loans, route-building, resource economy—and distills them into a game whose like I don’t expect to see again. It’s not your daddy’s engine-building game; it’s not your grandpa’s city-building game. Its tech tree drives the economy as well as everyone’s on-board development, built networks, and scoring. Every element of this game is tied tightly to every other. You can’t build a link or develop an industry or commit it to production without shaking the balance of the overall board.

And yet there’s room for incredibly creative play. Because every part of the game is part of the engine—because the game [i]is[/i] an engine—you can try to monopolize any part of it. You can try to develop your ships and piggyback in some ore refining; you can try to industrialize all the ports yourself and let the money roll in while you build links connecting everything you can. You can ship, ship, ship cotton until foreign demand is all dried up and you start committing your own ports to British distribution. You can play Brass how you like, and you and everyone else will have to react to how everyone else and you are inserting yourselves into the engine. The engine works fine; but players may have to compensate like mad to deal with what they themselves are doing to it.

At its heart, Brass, the engine-building game, is a game about logistics. You get no engine if you can’t get your logistics running. You have to plug in where you can plug in and start operating from there. You have to reach out and work with what’s around you, because getting an in for your engine defines where your little part of the engine fits in the big one, and that governs your strategy in every aspect.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

I like the way each industry has its own set of characteristics and there's some pretty serious hand management involved with the cards, but the numerous sub-systems feel clunky and disjointed, there's none of the elegance of Steam or even Last Train to Wensleydale. Above all though, there's a higher random factor in which cards you get and how quickly external markets deteriorate than I want to see in a game of this length. A quirkily attractive game, one I've learned to love, but in design terms not the best of Wallace.

RATING: 7
This is acutally quite bizarre.  In a good way, I think.  Despite the grim industrial theme, the gameplay is just quirky--you want people to take your cubes (making it almost an anti-Age of Steam) and connections work in an unusual way.  It's hard to wrap my head around but very, very interesting. 

Fiddliness and constantly shifting rules are finally knocking this down a point.  Still a good game though. (4 plays)

I played this recently and really like it. There are a lot of options for winning and each option has pluses and minuses. The economy or rules are quite elegant and really encourage careful planning, but don't rule out adjustments to your strategy based on what others are doing. 

I recommend printing off of the player aid that gives you an at-a-glance overview of buildings victory points and income.

Very good game. I won't rate it until I play it again, but I'm really liking it (in full disclosure, I came in last when playing with four).

A great economics game that is difficult to describe but easy to play.  After a round or two, it all comes together.

The economy is tight and you have to plan what cards to play and which to hold, but there's enough slack in the system to allow you to recover from the occasional mistake.  There are tough decisions to make and a lot of strategies to try.

As a sign of a great game, you're usually 1 coin short of being able to follow your perfect strategy - and all because you bought something last turn when you could have waited.

Everything you do affects others, but there's no direct competition, but you'll find yourself stymied at every turn as your opponent's build a canal just where you didn't want it, or take the last cotton mill in Colne.

Easily one of Martin Wallace's best games.

RATING: 9
Brass is a bit of a classic, and it plays that way, very focussed and very organised. I get the feeling it could be very competitive between good players. I still feel I haven't quite plumbed the depths of its strategy, since the theme is quite dry and it's hard to get to table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
At first it seems that there are many plausible strategies. However, the fact that, during the first epoch, you don't know what cards you will have for the second epoch, makes many of them largely gambles, especially as mass track building (a good way to pick up a good pile of points) restricts where you can play without a named-place card.

Sólo para "hardcore gamers". El nivel de simulación del proceso económico de industrialización es elevadísimo.  Martin Wallace ha engranado  diversas mecánicas como las de gestión de la mano, gestión de recursos, logística y algo de los "card driving games", para elaborar un diseño muy cuidado. Me gusta muchísimo la mecánica de usar las fábricas de los demás en su beneficio y no en el tuyo; que sea un juego que no está basado en un algoritmo únicamente (como Puerto Rico o Power Grid) y que sea de Wallace y no haya subastas (¡al fin!).PEGAS: demasiadas reglas que sólo se refieren a un único aspecto en concreto del juego. Elevada curva de aprendizaje. (19 partidas Online)

[ENG]

Just for hardcore gamers. It has a extremly high simulation level of the economic and industrial development. Martin Wallace has engaged different mechanisms (hand managment, resource managment, logistics and a bit of card driving games) and he designed a very detailed game. I love the mechanism that consists on using the another player´s industries on my own profit. I love Brass too becouse is not a script based game, like Puerto Rico or Power Grid. CONS: a lot of rules are referred just to a single aspect o situation of the game. They are, technically, rules, but they feel like exceptions, and there are so much exceptions. Learning curve.

Gioco complesso, non facile da imparare né da padroneggiare, destinato a coloro che amano cimentarsi a fondo con l’analisi delle posizioni e col ragionamento.

Qualcosa che fino a quel momento era sfuggito.

After a few solo turns to learn the game, I was a little worried my wife and friends might not like it. After playing the 2-player variant with my wife, I thought it was pretty good (rated it a 7). After thinking about the game all weekend and wishing I were playing it again, I upped it to an 8. More plays might find it near the top of my list. Can't wait to play again.

Feb08: I'm only one play in, but I'm loving it so far.  The rules are convoluted, but I find that 90% of them make logical sense once you start playing.  The only thing that is rough is the interaction of the cards and where you are allowed to play.

What I really enjoy is how dynamic the game is.  You get the best rewards for supplying the products in the highest demand.  It's also a fun decision to choose how far in debt or how much you want to develop.

I may have to pick this one up eventually.

I've only played two games; actually I am still in the middle of the 2nd game, but I am very immersed in the play. Though the number of rules might seem initially off-putting and the opening moves quite open, the game play settles into a very pleasant rhythm with consistently interesting choices, a clear sense of "if I only had one more action", and a compelling need to consider the play of others.
Wallace does an excellent job, given the limits of a board game, of mimicking the individual competitive side and the cooperative side of the rise of industry. Set-up time and put away time remains a little problematic, but I expect I will find some good ideas on how to be more efficient in the files as well as some more streamlined rules play. The chart and the frequently forgotten rules box included in the rules is a smart step in that direction by the makers themselves.

RATING: 7
One of the few games I prefer as an app rather than the actual tabletop version. The app version is an 8: beautiful rendition that plays well with a challenging AI. But the fiddly components and complex rules would make this a bear to teach or play in real life, which brings it down to a 7 for me.  Would usually be willing to play, but not something I would be interested in owning or want to teach to new players.

Two plays with 3 and 4 people. Brass shares some of its mechanics and part of its theme with Age of Steam, but it is a more streamlined game than AoS. The pricing is relatively straightforward, the difference between income and cash is clear and the only difficult part of the rules (where and under what circumstances you can build industries) becomes second nature before the end of the first game. The subtle competition (and, sometimes, cooperation) between players and the way that the game simulates a market for coal, iron and cloth really give Brass an authentic feel. The cards are a nice addition to a Martin Wallace game and, for once, the designer has resisted the temptation to throw in a die or two.

Demanding gamer's game.  And NOT an intuitive one at first.

You have to mix tactical manoeuvring with medium- and long-term planning like in almost no other game.

Good design, but after 12 plays it's worn out for me.
And the game is somewhat unfulfiling (for me, again).  My wins happened, but even after a dozen of plays I don't precisely know/feel how to play the game properly.

Network connections:economic:hand management:civ-like?  

Holy Moly! Best eat your wheaties before your first game or two of this whopper. Martin has graced us with another beaut of a Gamers game here, a VERY involved and engrossing game, thanks Martin!

Almost on par with POTR and AOS for the actual meat on the bone, very close.  While there are essentially only two ways to score once I heard the rest of the rules I was drowning in the lovely details to watch for.  This is a game of building and upgrading as efficiently as possible, in the right locations while also trying to connect to as many lucrative locations as possible, you are building for income and also for points.  Sounds easy but trust me it is not and will be very tricky with 4 players, I think 3 is a little more unforgiving so it was good number for the first learning game of this.  

Rules were a little tricky and took the best part of a game to really master, strategy was also somewhat elusive for the first half of my first game.  Lots of planning required, definitely a high strategy game and so far it appears to have some somewhat different approaches.  Also gamers will be happy to know there is very little luck in this game, it is card driven however the cards are multipurpose and you get to hold 8 in your hand while only having to play 2 per turn, this really minimizes the luck of the draw.  Component wise nice to see full-size cards but they were too thin, money is that plastic crappy money like AOS and other than that everything else was nice and up to par. 

The board will always have the same outline like RRT or AOS, this coupled with almost no random elements could hurt replayability/freshness a little unless a new map is introduced ala AOS however the card draw will help this somewhat as will your own different approaches to how you play a given game.  Overall I feel another very good game I'm looking forward to playing more, games should get down to 2 hours after a few plays, until then expect to see 2.5 to 3 depending on whether you have 3 or 4 players. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] Well there might be a little more luck here than I first thought. The cotton shipping really is a little silly with a -4 stuck in the pile, totally reminds me of the random Indians while settling in AOEIII which I also didn't like. While thematic I wish these kind of elements were left out of long high strategy games, at least here you can hopefully build your own port or use someone elses to avoid that unnecessary risk. Card luck while having 8 cards and only playing 2 can still sting you, especially in 4 player game and especially for a big ship placement as spots are so limited for these, these are big points and this will hurt I'm just not sure yet how much.

Amazing game, I love the shared resources system. Pretty much everything you do will be helping both you and at least one opponent, so the key seems to be to put yourself into a position that you're getting helped a lot and that when you do things you're not helping others too much. I definitely don't think I have a great grasp on this yet but it's so interesting that I want to keep playing and learning how it works. The symbiosis between the players is amazing. Sometimes the cards can be a bit frustrating if you don't get what you need, but that for me is a minor complaint here, and I don't think it would work if anyone could build anything anywhere so there needs to be some system. The foreign market though I really don't like, in particular the fact that you could just be wasting your action and throw away a card for literally no benefit is pretty rough, especially since this comes down at least somewhat to chance.

This would have been a 9.5 if I had played it 5 years ago. It looks terrific, it's streamlined, it's fun. Many opportunities for creative play. It's not dry at all. The theme is about as evocative as a Euro comes. BUT... it's nothing really new. Side nitpick: I don't like VP-scramble endgames--"don't have much else to do, so I'll build two track to the most circles." Games need to end before this happens.

EDIT: Upgrading to a 9. Now that I'm getting my head around this game, I find the mechanics elegant (the rulebook isn't, but the play is) and the action competitive and tense.

Fine economic game from Martin Wallace, set in England (Lancashire) at the dawn of the industrial revolution.

I am very impressed with the game. Its economic model is pretty advanced, the rules need a bit of wrapping one's head around (but quickly become clear when playing), there is plenty of strategy and a strong feeling of history (which, to me, really makes the game stand out when compared to some of the more generic economic games on the market). The game also moves along quickly.

For me, the best game from Essen 2007 of the ones I have tried.

Easy enough to learn the basics.  Tons of "aha!" moments in the first games as strategies are learned. Just enough uncertainty from the cards you get, but you can always pull something out from your ear if you're careful.  If you're not careful, you will bash your head against the wall that you used your Barrow-in-Furness cards two turns previous when you should have used your Wigan card.

Near-abstract levels of strategy.  Feels almost epic, in a merely long game.

It's slightly fiddly, but not half as bad as some people make it out to be.

Very complex game, it has a depth I didn´t notice until I had a few games under my belt. At first I didn´t like it very much (like Acquire) but right now I´m loving it. It´s become one of my all time favorites even though, at the time being, I have won only once :D. The mechanics are simple, but the strategic decisions are very very hard to master. I picture myself playing this for a long time. 

My only regret is that it is kind of hard to find players for this game as it has a steep learning curve.  

On a related note, I´m begginng to love more and more the "Wallace" games. (Age of Steam, Liberte, Rise of Empires).

I have played a lot of Brass and I still like it a lot, however I´m downgrading its rating so it matches my feelings for the game with the BGG recommendation system. Also, I feel the game has a lot of downtime with 4 players, but as the game is so involving I don’t care as much because I´m always thinking about my next move.

It has been almost 5 years since I first played Brass. In those days I was a different player, new to the hobby and I couldn’t appreciate Brass for what it truly was, a truly marvelous game. To this day, I have played around 60 times and I still won’t say no to a game of Brass.

It has some luck of the draw, but 9 out of 10 times, the player who planned the best will be the winner, that is, the luck factor is low. Easy rules but each decision is important and has far reaching consequences. All of this is not apparent on the first (or second) play.

I’m a bit sad that the game didn’t get any official expansion.

Definitively best with 4 players, but I won’t say no to a 3 player game :D.

Bottom line, a great game, perhaps (along with Age of Steam) the best I have sampled from Martin Wallace and also one of the first (perhaps the very first) of his games I ever played.

I sold my copy of Brass and got the Deluxe edition. It comes with metal coins (nice!) and with a two player map. I’m disappointed in the map because it is the same one than before but with less locations. I would have liked a radically new map. When I play with it (if I do, I don’t have much desire to play Brass with 2 players) I will comment on it. 

The insert also disappointed me. I recently bought The Gallerist and the insert was great, as EGG is the same company I was sure this one was also going to be great BUT for some reason, the insert cover doesn’t match the insert on a side, so the bits in that compartment are not confined to it and when your transport the game they get loose on the box :angry:. I’m not sure why EGG did the insert cover in this fashion :/.

Brass is currently on Kickstarter and I wasn’t about to pledge on it. The new edition of the game looks incredible, but I, honestly, don’t care much about art and components. I care much more about the gameplay so I wasn’t going to pledge, but I did because I wanted the new Brass: Birmingham :D.

I’m undecided, but I think I will keep my Brass: Deluxe copy of the game with the metal coins and the two player map (although my desire to play Brass with 2 players is very low). I will see if I also keep the new Brass: Lancanshire edition. I don’t like that they changed some rules, but I need to see for myself.

One of 2007´s favorites.

A lot of interesting decisions here.  Theme is very well integrated with mechanics.  Not easy to figure out on first play, however.

I'm more impressed by this game as I gain more plays.  Interaction is high and there are multiple paths to victory.  Restrictions on tile placement make this something of a positional game.  Cards introduce a potentially frustrating randomness in which one cannot take all the actions one wants, often a good thing in games but feels a little arbitrary in this one.

I rate this 8.5, knowing that we have yet to play the game completely correct.  We are using the 2-player variant found here on bgg.  There are some little complexities in the rules that take a few games to iron out (at least for us).  But we both still have fallen for this game, for the building and planning and crazy tight hand management.

Update:  After 5 plays, I can say that it is amazing and now in my top 10.

Finally got a play in on this one...and my intial impression is a favorable one.  I've seen a few comments in terms of this game being hard to learn or hard to teach others and I suppose it's not completely without merit.  I felt like myself and the other new guy were competitive the first game (the other new guy won) and it did take a few turns to truely get the mechanics of the game but overall it wasn't that bad.  I would say that I'd have a harder time explaining RFTG than this game. 

This is a game that I will buy after that play.  The biggest issue I have with it will be finding the time and players to get it to hit the table.  I think our game with explanation went over 3 hrs.  An experienced group however could bang it out in probably more like one and a half or two hours.

Downgrading to a 7.  Doesn't hit the table often enough, difficult to teach, and feels a bit samey.

RATING: 9
Very heavy feeling for a game that can be finished in 2.5 hours.  Not including the hour-long debate about the benefits of various strategies.  Three games, and I've seen three different distinct paths to victory.  And there were two other attempts that might have won with some tweaking of the overall strategy.  Gotta love the choices.  That said, there will be those who hate this game, for reasons that cannot be argued.  It is fiddly, and the first play is largely one of confusion as players try to figure out the (many!) subtleties of the game.  A gamers game if ever there was one.

Another Walace game that misses the mark.  There's a problem here in that the rich keep getting richer and the poor can't catch up... and there's no income reduction (like in Age of Steam) to try and rectify the situation.

I am not a fan of Wallace's game designs... and this game is a prime example why.  I doubt that I'll ever play this game again.

It is a good example of 'try before you buy'... this was actually on my wish list until I had the opportunity to play it.

Rating has increased from a 6 after a second play with the *correct* rules. In my first game, the teacher forgot to mention that development costs 1 iron per tile. Thus, both coal and iron works seemed worthless during much of the canal phase, skewing my perception of game balance and dynamics. Playing correctly revealed a variety of strategic options from the start that made the game much more enjoyable. My one concern is that taking at least one loan early - if not two - seems almost a precondition for victory. The advantage of having enough money to be flexible in your tactics seems to be huge; I'm not sure how one could manage this without borrowing money early. If so, that will keep my rating from going much higher. I'm not keen on games that force certain plays; if the game is well-balanced, players who don't take loans should have an equal opportunity to win. I'd love to hear from someone who has won without taking loans in which other comparably experienced players took them.

Just got this today.  Can't wait to play it but I'm pretty sure I'll like it.  

3/28.  Just played for the first time.  Outstanding game even though I'm sure I played it incorrectly.  UvulaBob is right . . . you don't quite feel like you truly understand what you're doing (I think Metzler had the same comment), but the game really fits together.

Plastic money doesn't bother me as much as it probably should.  High-quality components and I really like the cards.  Iconography is very easy to learn.  The rule book isn't as clear as it should be, but a few uploaded videos can clear up most of your questions.

Bottom line, this game is outstanding, and worthy of its top-ten rank.

First impression: Brass is a great, strategic economic game. I really enjoyed my one play of it.

It might even play faster with more experienced players.

Martin Wallace hates you.  That's all you really need to know.

31.1.2008: Rated after one three-player game. I'm certain it's better with four players, because it felt a bit open with three. I can see why people compare it to both Power Grid and Age of Steam, but I think it has a very different feel than those two games. The economics aren't as tight as Age of Steam. I think the cards work wonderfully, they limit your choices but not too much. The game felt very balanced with many ways to victory.

RATING: 9
Brass is a game of building industries and networks, producing resources, and generating income. But, it does none of these things in the usual expected ways. You don't sell resources. You don't always need to be connected in a network to move some of the resources. A network does not give you income. You don't need to pay back loans (you take an income hit up front instead). 

The five different industries in the game all behave quite differently and combined with the canal/rail connectors this sets up a complicated web of relationships and player options. While there is a lot of meat in the strategy of your industries, the use of cards for actions adds a nice tactical element without damaging the game with excessive randomness.

In short, excellent stuff. The rulebook is more opaque than usual and the special laws that govern each industry makes some of the rules easy to forget or misinterpret.

A symbiotic affair driven by hand management and tile placement. Like many-a-Wallace there are loans, a decent integration of theme, and some odd rules (iron can teleport?). This one feels a bit more generous than Age of Steam though I do like the increased level of interdependence. I don't necessarily love developing through industry (blah) but my biggest gripe is that near the end of an era you often find yourself building links or at the end of game taking loans in order to maximize points; kinda pulls me out of the experience. Overall a solid design. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
As a decades long fan of economic games, this to me feels like the single best Martin Wallace design and my favorite crunchy business game.  I feel Automobile to be an outstanding model of the dealership system (as someone in an industry with dealerships), but the game bogs down in cumbersome math toward the end.  I feel you are rewarded for slowing the game with some intensive what/if calculations to max/min your position.  Tinner's Trail is solid, but not quite as compelling to me (though I own that too, and recommend it).

Brass is a fabulous and balanced design right up there with Power Grid/Funkenschlag, far faster than an 18XX game, and marginally superior to even the best recent business sims that I know (it is a little different, but I have to offer a quick shout out to La Granja and the well known design brilliance of Caverna).  

You may find the initial hands of cards to be challenging, but remember all your options including the use of any two cards as one wild card.  A bit of practice will show paths to work through a difficult card set.

Consider the electronic copy to learn the game, and start converting people to this classic business game.  Maybe we can get the French map published more broadly!

One of my very favourite games. I have not played it as much as I would like to as people complain that it makes their brain hurt.

Where do I start. I just think once you understand it, it just hangs together so well. Lots of unique concepts that take a while to get your head around.

My first game I built lots of ports, thinking people would have to use them, they did not and I could not score them all, got hammered. Second game went for Shipyards, and did much better.

Just started my first online game. I'll say it's not being used to the online board, but 4 turns in and I am already miles behind.

RATING: N/A
Games like Power Grid and Stone Age are what might be called 'transparent' economic games - after you play once you pretty much understand how it works and the aim after that is to optimise your gameplay (which may take many many more plays).  Brass is an opaque economic game.  By 'opaque' I mean that its one of those games with a lot of interlocking mechanisms which is difficult to sort through to find a good strategy.  Even after several plays (and certainly after one play) you are still thinking, "how does this work?", not in the sense of understanding the rules, but in understanding the relative values of things - your best move is very unclear at most points in the game.  Games like Brass require a LOT of plays in order to 'get it'.  They are the sort of games where a new player CAN beat a moderately experienced player.  They are games where someone wins and someone loses and no-one can really put their finger on why.  My preference is for the more transparent game, although I am happy to play opaque games as well and would gladly play Brass again.  My only other comment is that Brass seems a little long.  Brass probably overstays its welcome by just one or two turns.

Quote from Martin De Jong which I would agree with:  "I must say I'm a bit surprised to see this game rank so highly, although I can explain it quite well: it is a growth game, it offers multiple viable paths to victory, it is low on uncontrollable luck, and it is repetitive."  I would add that Brass will generally not suffer from a runaway leader problem and (more importantly) it does not appear to have a runaway leader problem.  People seem to like that.  This is not to say that Brass is a bad game - its a good game, but a top ten place just seems a bit high to me.  Its the sort of game I would expect to see at around number 100.

I enjoy games where the players build up a location together but in competition. Le Havre and Caylus both do this well, but the "fees" variety of worker placement doesn't quite satisfy like Brass does. Here, you have scoring incentives to bind cities together via canal and rail, but doing so may create an opportunity in that city that will be snatched up before you can capitalize on it. Building canal and rail connections will also impact the flow of coal, perhaps making your own mines more convenient suppliers. Or, building new mines might curtail demand for an opponent's more distant mine. New factories will require iron and coal for construction, which will raise demand, perhaps creating an opportunity for an opponent. And as experienced players know, consuming iron for R&D can start the vultures circling. 

Your placement options in Brass are restricted by a hand of cards, something which rubs some players the wrong way. As a long-lapsed Mt:Ger, hand-management is hardwired into me. The 8-card hand in Brass provides just the right balance between immediate tactical play, an ongoing 4-turn projection, and the ability to tweak, adjust, and respond. 

I've upgraded my rating to a 10 after nine plays. The depth of play and integration of theme are top-tier. 

See also: [b][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/401927]My Strategy Poll for Experienced Players[/url][/b]

Update (3-9-10): I haven't played this in a few months, and the reason is that I'm worried that the actual experience of Brass is a small bait-and-switch with my "platonic ideal" of Brass. It seems crystal clear to me that the 4P game rewards taking loans hand-over-fist. Income building goes uphill and against the grain. The reverse is true of a 3-player game, which is a full four turns (8 actions) longer. A couple of loans can jumpstart an engine that far outstrips profligate loan-taking. Perhaps 15 plays doesn't make me an expert but I think both of these observations is strictly true. 

I think I want Brass to be a single game that compromises between the two extremes, instead of one with such drastically different settings. I don't know what this bodes for the future. Hopefully it is not the game's Achilles Heel for me.

Wow, I was really impressed with this one. I'd definitely like to buy it. I somewhat prefer games where the actions of other players can change your plans.

I'm playing more by the feeling anyway...

I usually enjoy Martin Wallace's economic games (while I'm not so much into his conflict packed Warfrog stuff) and this one is no exception. It is a clever mix of his usual elements: Few actions per player round, income track, loans, changing turn order, network building. Remarkably, there are no auctions this time (as in Automobile). It also has the usual rough edges of his self-developed games. Why does ore fall from the sky while coal has to be transported on canals or railroads? Why do you need 8 cards in your hand when they don't matter in 80% of the decisions? But all elements together form a game that leaves you thinking about better strategies in next play. More cotton production, earlier development instead of early cash-in, a railroad strategy? Various ways seem possible. Tactical optimization is needed as well ("No, I'm missing one money to do that!"). More play is wanted but not so easy to get. Startup investment for new players is high and with averagely slow players expect 3-4 hours for a game.

Fantastic game. The depth of strategy and player interaction is great. You seriously have to pay attention to what your opponents are doing or your game will be shot. Mirroring your opponents strategy will kill you in this game.

I consider the first game a learning game.  The rules aren't the greatest, but some time spent on BGG has clarified things.  I like the theme of the game and the mechanics seem pretty fresh.  As long as the play time can decrease I'm pretty sure my rating will go up.  I like economic management games, and this one seems quite thematic and challenging.  I hope that the fixed map will not limit replayability.

Update: This is an enjoyable game - a little unintuitive, but not too bad once you get going.  Unfortunately I think it will be too difficult to get this one to the table, as it is not well-regarded by everyone in my group.  

Update: Having played online I now am beginning to understand the game and the different possible strategies.  I am finally starting to see the light.  Up to an 8.

Update 6/10: I only wish I could play this FTF.  But I love playing it online so much it has to go up to a 9.

A deep economic game which plays in a relatively short time.  Most of the games I have played have clocked under 2.5 hours.  Rating probably will go up once I figure out if the game is balanced.  Right now it seems like the shipyards are too much trouble and cannot compete with the cotton.

This is one of those games that I can't rate after only one play.
What a steep learning curve.  I played my first game against two veterans who were very good teachers, but just creamed me.  I think I enjoyed it but was lost most of the game.  Not lost as to what I could do (though I was confused as to what had to be connected how a couple times) but lost as to how things could fit and work together.
Definitely needs more plays.

Have played a game online and definitely enjoyed it more. Would love to try more F2F

As you could expect from Martin Wallace, Brass offers you a complex experience that is strongly tied to the theme. I like the two round setting and I think the way to handle the turn order evolution is one of the best I've seen. The loan system is very unorthodox and seems to be very forgiving. The end of the game could be a bit of an anticlimax.

RATING: 10
The simple actions and rather quick flow are great aspects of such a deep game, but the "use my stuff" interactions is where this game shines. Card play is, for me, a flaw of this game, where it can randomly hurt, but does not bring anything to help. While I understand it's meant to guide your strategy and keep you from doing the same thing every game, I think it does a lousy job at that, since only one action requires using the cards, and still has too much of a chance of screwing you over.

I could be mistaken after just a few plays, but Brass seems to have a much different nerve from Age of Industry. The theme comes into much sharper relief.

In AoI, it can feel like you're not executing a strategy as much as successively hunting for efficiency gains among an open array of balanced options. In Brass, the era shift breaks things up and you need to think about your current and future options because more than just a few coins could hang in the balance.

In Brass, hand management matters: you can't take anything for granted and there are meaningful availability and accessibility concerns. The downside is that in Brass, hand management matters: you could be discarding useless cards for several rounds and [i]still[/i] not have useful ones once the draw pile is exhausted.

I don't like the random foreign market mechanism; it seems at odds with the rest of the design. You could perhaps replace it with a statistically representative succession of non-random sales?

Coal and iron are more fundamentally distinct in Brass, although the various extra maps in AoI have quirks that play around with these resources for extra variation.

AoI accommodates five players, is designed for expansions and is developed to greater polish, which probably explains why it feel less tight, more generic and more forgiving. Brass has one specific scenario, but if it's good enough, do you need others?

Poker chips worked well for money. Put those stacks in the boxes without fear of one spilling into the other.

Minor niggle: mistaken perception of who's in the lead affecting the outcome when building over iron and coal in the late game.

The entry barrier into this is the way the rules are written which must be one of the worst examples of not considering your audience (barring most of 30 years of PowerPoint presentations I've been subjected to).  Otherwise, I recall it being a great game, just one that never comes out because no-one can face scanning the rules again.

Tremendous game!  This game challenges you.  It is difficult to grasp.  Both teaching and learning the game systems is demanding.  The network of interlocking decisions can seem opaque at first.  But as you build experience with the game, it starts to make more and more internal sense.

I find this game very immersive.  I do ocassionally win, but often I fall short.  I like the battle against the game itself as well as the other players.  I imagine I will always love this game.

I rate this a 10/10 for game design.  When I played this a lot I really enjoyed it.  The map and gameplay I've grown a bit bored with over time though such that I've not much desire to play it anymore.  I've also forgotten most of the strategy and this is a game where experienced players absolutely crush newbies.  I started to like Age of Industry more than this one but ultimately ended up getting rid of that game as well.  Some fond memories here.

Great Euro with minimal luck. Plenty of different strategies to use. Your cards dictate what type of actions you want to play. It is competitive but you also rely on your opponents resources of where and what you want to build in order to achieve victory points and income. This has a good amount of interaction for being an economic resource game. The one downside is it can be hard to get this to the table. A few times players look at the box, I tell them it's about selling cotton and transporting coal, and they think it's the most dullest thing. Maybe I just give bad sale pitches. Regardless, I love this game when I can get it out.

Very meaty economic game not for the faint of heart. The aspect that I most enjoyed from this game was the player interactions. Watching your players strategies unfold and feeding off of them for personal advantage is very rewarding. This begs more plays just so I can determine a better line of play with regards to money issues of taking out loans and/or building an old fashioned money engine. This game may be a tad bit long for four, but I wouldn't mind sitting down with that many.

RATING: 9
Excellent game. One of my favorites after only a few plays. It will certainly take a few more plays to get my arms around it, as the inter connection to each of the elements can be quite complex. A suboptimal strategy from one player can actually help another player  (i.e. constantly draining resources without building your own) which could be hard to combat if it is persistent. Helps when all players are of similar experience level (which is true for most games of this type).

Outstanding complex logistic and economic strategy game. Money management is crucial. When taking loans, take them early and consider taking the maximum of 30 to avoid wasting too much actions. Don't forget to develop at least a couple of times. Try to keep a presence on the board after the Canal Period. Player order can be important, keep an eye on this when timing certain actions (like building cotton mills and selling cotton). Play in function of the cards you get and adapt when necessary. Building rail track is a great source of victory points.

PLUS
Ciekawy inowacyjny koncept: zbudowana infrastruktura musi służyć także przeciwinikom, żeby dawała sukces. Kilka ciekawych mechanizmów (degresja dochodów; kredyty i ich spłata wkomponowana w system dochodów; kolejność graczy), niezła dawka interakcji i fenomen, że z czasem na planszy można robić coraz mniej a zarazem coraz więcej (inni gracze blokują pola swoimi budynkami zarazem umożliwiając inne akcje poprzez kożystanie z tych budynków).
MINUS
Niepotrzebne odchylenia od konceptu podstawowego, przez to niepotrzebne reguły na wyjątki.
SUMA
Za pierwszym razem gra koncepcyjnie trudna do pojęcia ale bardzo wynagradzająca i motywująca do wymyślania nowych metod grania w następnych partiach.

PLUS Interesting and innovative concept: your built infrastructure must serve your opponents as well in order to yield profit. Some interesting mechanisms (income degression; credits and paybacks implemented in the income system; players order), some interaction and the phenomenon, that with the game progressing the options on the board decrease and increase at the same time (facilities built by opponents occupy spaces but also make other actions possible by being used).
MINUS
Some unnecessary deflections from the basic concept creates unnecessary exception rules.
SUM
First play may be difficult and the game concept hard to grasp but it is very rewarding and motivates thinking about future games and different playing methods.

Interesting game with a good few options. not always obvious.

I really have to leave logic at the door with this one... 

what do the cards represent?
what do the points represent?
why does the income boost go down for the 'best' buildings?
why do railways / canals give you no income?
why can't i build that BLOODY PORT when i have the money, resources and a link [becouse i need a feckin' 'port' card... ffs!]

- despite all that it is a decent game, lots of choices, lots of options, lots of interaction & tension... i just have to remeber the theme is just that. a THEME.

Just bought this excellent heavier Euro game.  The first "economic" game I own, but perhaps not the last.  I have not yet figured out how to make the shipping strategy work in my two plays, so I think it's time I tried a production/rails strategy next game. Watch these comments next week.  The Rulebook is excellent and gets full marks -- very little is unclear, though it may require two readings (readings, I might add, that are fun, due to the excellent design and logical layout choices).
* NOTE: The Shipyards are overwhelmingly tempting.  I have succumbed yet again (and lost).  I begin to despair of escaping their lure...  I have also raised my rating to an 8.
* UPDATE: I have played again, and successfully avoided shipyards altogether in favor of an aggressive cotton mill strategy.  I won!
* UPDATE: I was doing well, with my "build a few mills and ports, then ship all at once" technique.  Then I succumbed and built a shipyard. I LOST!

RATING: 7.5
Well after playing 1830 I see some shortcomings to this design.

I won't talk about the rules or odd things. but in a game that is about timing and handmanagement the handmanagement aspect can be very cruel. 
In the entire game I had only ONE opportunity to build a port (or I had to sacrifice another action which I should have done probably). I didn't draw port industry cards and I only had once a city where you could build a port which i did. To be honest I drew a city but before it was my turn the port was taken. 
being forced into cotton mills because of my cards the fact that the distant market only managed to ship in both rounds three times didn't help me much either. 
And being hopefull I developed cotton and ports. Ports to no avail. Cotton was good for me.

Anyway handmanagement and distant markets are two parts of the game that have some luck in it.  And in a game that is part planning/ part taking opportunities when they present themselves I thought it was too much.

I need further plays to be sure. 

Now what I really liked about the game was that you can play with a loan strategy or an income base strategy. I'm impressed how balanced they appear. That's why I give it an 8 at the moment.
 Bad luck in distant markets (drawing the one tile that doesn't allow you to produce, and lose the game for that reason) and bad card draws have it at a 6.5.

In retrospect instead of producing I could have build railroads and win and that is another thing I have trouble with you can perfectly count the number of points each player will score making it easier to take the right (or safer) action but it takes a pretty long time.

I think next time I'll probably try to keep track of that.

Update third play.

still feel there is luck required. Certainly the last two cards; can you do anything with them or are they only to be used for connections, upgrading or producing.
In the canal era these aren't too bad but since the board is so filled up at the end of the rail era it plays a part.

I still give the game the benefit of the doubt allthough I just rated it under an 8 now. It can all be about handmanagement.


Personal feeling : Perhaps handmanagement is something I don't like. Games like 1830 and Indonesia I prefer over Brass. TTR is another game that has handmanagement and it works because it is pretty light. 1960 is another game that features handmangement that I have played but the game is much more card driven than Brass I feel.

So to me the question is : "Is Brass a game if you would take out the cards?"

Let me rephrase would Brass work if you were allowed to do the actions you wanted to do without using the cards.

I can understand if someone loves Brass: it has nice twist, few interesting mechanisms and it offers many strategies for winning AND it isn't multiplayer solitaire! Brass is almost good game, but 1) there are too much downtime and the game is a bit too long. But strong 7 from me nonetheless.

Euro style game

If you like train games, or power grid (mathy - heavy - euro games) may like it. If you like a theme... this game is Themeless, so you may not enjoy.

Not for my game group.

This is a luck of the cards game that is so well-dressed up as an economic simulator that it will take you several plays to notice that this a a luck of the cards game.   I have the German version, Kohle, but that ought not to matter.  Making player mats for it was fun ....

RATING: 8.1
Preliminary rating: this game needs to be played more to know what it deserves. It's certainly well-balanced, a 'multiple ways to win' game with lots of strategic options. The rules are a bit fiddly but the rulebook is simply terribly structured/written.
I want to play it more.

Several games.  I really liked this game, much more than I expected, since Martin Wallace games are a mixed bag in my opinion.  I felt that a mistake early in the game is recoverable, to at least a certain extent, and I really liked how all the parts fit and worked together.  The rules are fiddly, though, with lots of little rules that can fall through the cracks.

The iconic Martin Wallace game.  Super solid experience, rich and yet streamlined gameplay, nice depth.  The fixed map is the only thing I'm not to keen on.  It's sometime awkward (Birkenhead-Liverpool), plain ugly and only re-playable so many times before you feel like a change.  Still, an excellent game.

RATING: 8
An excellent economics connections game (canals and trains) that is very different and very original.  However, it's got a learning curve to it and it has lots of fiddly and meaty rules here and there and plenty of little details and difficult to learn from scratch.  It's highly recommended to be taught by someone who is very experienced and knows all the intricacies really well.  Brass is essentially two games in one (using the same board twice in slightly different ways) and using the same building generators.  Everyone starts with the same capacity of building tile stacks but strategies and opportunities can vary greatly.  The first half is the canal phase and the second half (consisting much more of your score) is the train phase.  The economics aspect of the game lies with the players trying to increase income by building ports, coal, iron, cotton and shipyard companies.  The only knock is that it can create analysis paralysis with certain players, which would bring the game length to a slow crawl, adding an extra hour or two.

RATING: 10
Another excellent economic engine from Martin Wallace, this time without implementing the auction mechanic.  I both appreciated and was frustrated with the cards limiting where you can build your buildings, and it was even more aggravating when I chose to throw away cards to build track/canals that I should have kept for later use.  In this game, its important to anticipate where you think much of the building will take place and save the appropriate cards for proper use while using junk cards to build track or develop.  This was one game that I never thought I would be interested in trying when I saw a group of friends attempt to learn and play the game at the same time with no veterans of this game around midnight and just struggle with it but it goes very smoothly when you have someone who knows the game explain the process.

RATING: 10
Another excellent Martin Wallace game.  This may be the high point of the meaty Euro genre in terms of density of decisions and plenitude of options per turn.  Very satisfying but it can be frustrating when one has a hand of nearly useless cards (admittedly this may occur because of a lack of strategic forethought).  This game plays very differently as the skill of the players increases.

RATING: 9
My first-ever 10 rating. At first it was an 8 because I thought the randomness was too high with the cards and the distant market, but now I see you can mitigate most of it through clever play.

Unlike other economic games, other players aren't going to be kingmaking, but you still have a lot of player interaction, using each other's infrastructure, but jockeying for position at the same time.

I love that it's a fixed-length game (16 turns at most), and that you need to strike a good mix of strategy and tactics.

Update: Back down a notch. It's too constrained and formulaic for it to be a 10. Maybe Age of Industry will take its place after more plays.

Also too tight for the randomness in the cards and what other players do. One bad incident (cards, other players moves) and you're out of the game for good.

Martin Wallace at his greatest.  I am not terribly good at this game, but it is a lot of fun.  The economy is reminiscent to Steam (with separate but inter-related income and VP tracks).  And the spacial element/route-building is similar to a train pick-up-and-deliver game.  But there is also an element of supply and demand of resources, akin to Power Grid.

RATING: 9
I admit, I was not expecting to like Brass.  It looked dry and un-pretty.  (It is un-pretty, actually, but it has a certain spare dignity on closer inspection.)  But what a surprise.  This was my first Wallace game, and I understand the hype.  The whole system, with its dozens of niggly rule exceptions, does come together to create something weirdly organic and satisfying.  The pleasures of this game are very hard to describe, but they're deeper than most; it's simply a rich gaming experience, one that seems likely to stand up to repeated plays and exploration.

An entirely unique economic game where half way through the game, the rules change where you shift from the canal age to the steam age.  The game has elements of a train game but is very economic and thematic.  It includes many paths to victory.

Having played [i]Brass[/i] now as both a two, three and four player game, I'd have to say I prefer with four.  In fact, if I'd have to be persuaded to play with three again.

My wife and I have played it a few times as it seemed the natural next step after [i]London[/i].

Have the EGG 2009 edition, the EGG Deluxe 2015 edition, and waiting for the Roxeley edition.

Update: This game is pure brilliance. If any game really deserves a 10, it is Brass. The learning curve is a bit long, but so worth it. The rules themselves have a few gameplay exceptions that can be easy to forget but overall rules are actually not hard. What makes this game brilliant yet needing several learning plays is how the relatively simple rules interact to create so many tough and interesting choices.   I'm glad I have a group who were as willing to dive into the nuances of this game as I. If you do not have the deluxe edition coins from EGG, get them. And print out one of the player boards found in the files section. These enhance the game experience immensely.

As a side note, Age of Industry doesn't even come close to Brass for me.

RATING: 10
Take part in the industrial revolution!

A very strategic game.

Rules heavy, but into the second game I no longer noticed it, and was just playing the game.  I was concerned this aspect of the game would be a reason I may not like it, but that was not the case.

In Brass, you plan a strategy early on you would like to execute to build a network of constructed industries.  One cool aspect is that each industry (represented by a tile) does not score until the goods it produced (iron, coal, cotton) are used or sold.  Then you "flip" the tile to indicate it is profitable/working and you earn the VP's and increase your income level.

While you have an overall strategy, you should also watch to see what is in demand making it a tactical game as well.

I like the turn order mechanism - the person who spends the least money in a turn will go first next time around (whoever spends the most goes last).

There is a good deal of interaction between players, both in taking opportunities/connections, but also needing to use each others' goods and ports in order to develop your own.  If you always avoid using opponents' goods/ports so as to not help them, I think you will more often lose.  This is pretty unique.

A downside might be the rules - this is a heavy game with many mechanics, and some exceptions to rules.  The number of rules makes to the game less accessible to people who like lighter games.

10/2011 An excellent game again by mr. Wallace! Alright, it could have been more polished and the rules could have been a lot clearer.  My first impression was overwhelming chaos management; then eventually about half-way thinks started getting into place.  There's so much to do and so little time; planning is required but flexibility pays off; money management is crucial - bite the bullet and take two full loans.  Requires several more plays.

After one play, I was already looking forward to the next play. That's always a good sign. There's lots of room here for strategy and multiple paths to victory, and just enough randomness in the variety of cards to ensure players don't try the same strategy over and over.

There's a rumour going around that this game has complicated rules; it doesn't. Once you understand the narrative concepts (cubes represent long-term delivery contracts, coal is used in vastly greater quantities than iron) there's nothing that's particularly difficult to get your head around. I'll admit explaining the rules is a little trickier, but you can always print out a rules summary and use that to assist you.

I have only played this on the Android App, against the AI opponents.  On the app it plays quickly, with instantaneous setup and takedown, less than 20 minutes per match.  Under those conditions it is an excellent game that I like to play repeatedly and continues to improve with play.  I don't know yet how the game feels with a tabletop match, which is bound to be significantly longer and hampered by rules mistakes.  The game so far feels understandeable, fluid, interesting, of a good weight that is opaque enough without being inaccessible, with interesting co-dependency decisions and an interesting gaming space shared by all players.  I like it a lot.

Some interesting ideas and others quite questionable (as in all Wallace's designs for me), like the cards.

Overall, an economic game lacking something alluring enough to make you desire to play it again soon.

There is a healthy debate as to which game is better Brass or Age of Industry. Having played Brass first, I understand how the game works and to me Age of Industry is "Brass-light" but AGe of Industry is a better choice in my opinion at bringing in new players.

Wonderful game. Thematically brilliant. Game Mechanics superb. Played with people of the same level this game is always tight. 
Cleanly designed game where you cannot rely on one strategy to win. You need to anticipate correctly to the cards you draw, and your opponents moves.

Okay, I admit it: my brain is just not wired for economic/logistics games, but that doesn't stop me from loving them. This game is a bugaboo to teach/understand. Once you get the exceptions down, the game moves along at a pretty good pace. I found myself getting excited about the next turn and all of the possibilities available. I'm looking forward to more plays of this. I hope I can get it on the table again soon.

Wow, this game got really tight in the rail phase.  My finances were a razor thin margin that I kept cutting my wrists with.

After several more plays, this game still hasn't worn out it's welcome, although I'm beginning to wonder if my RailSplosion(patent pending) technique is overpowered.  I think the best (only) counter is to do the same thing...  still not sure.

After a lot of plays, I still think rails are powerful, but careful cotton rushing is usually more powerful.

Excellent game to me - good variation of activities, some race for best spots and opportunities, money management. Seems quite natural to me comparing to Powergrid, that has may abstract and unnatural rules. Building industries is rewarding and winner is not easily spotted. Constructive gameplay, destruction or alliances hardly found, is what makes it nice.

RATING: 6
A very difficult game to rate, this one.  Played 3 times, with each game taking around four hours.  At the end of each game there is a feeling that very little has been learned and the players are reeling from the complexity of the game.  Any progress made in strategy is undermined by the random draw of the cards which can ruin a player's game.  It's a game I feel deserves to played enough to get the strategies sorted out, but at four hours a go it's not one I'm in any rush to play again.

This was my first heavy-ish economic game, and while it was a bit bewildering at first, by the end it all made sense and I could see more of the intricacies. While the overall strategy is somewhat dictated by the cards you draw, there's still a fair amount of space to maneuver with plenty of decisions to make. There's very little direct interaction, but other players' choices will strongly affect what you can do. It's not a game I would feel like playing very often, but I enjoyed it.

Brass is an outstanding board game. While there are usually only a few optimal actions to take each turn, your choices are by no means limited. You must be consistent, but you are also required to diversify your approach throughout the game. Consequently, Brass is quite the brain-burner. Tough decisions have to be made every turn, and AP is sure to set in at some point. Brass no doubt has its drawbacks: a cumbersome/poorly edited rulebook, lengthy gameplay, and its inherent inaccessibility to novice gamers. This is NOT a gateway game, nor is it a middleweight. It's a big game with complex mechanisms. It's one of the best I've played. If you have the patience and the experience, Brass can be a rewarding challenge. Incidentally, the components and general production quality are top-notch.

Update 11/14/15: 

After not playing Brass for over 2 years, I was excited to get it back to the table again--esecially since I just upgraded to the "deluxe" edition. The new edition is mostly the same, but the coins and box insert are a nice touch. The gameplay is simply fantastic. It gives you that feeling before the game, of "oh, okay, I'm excited now!" The rules are a bit heavy, and it's hard to remember everything if you are new to the game (or haven't played in a while). That said, the rules are perfectly fine and comprehendible, unlike a game like Robinson Crusoe. I still love Brass and hope to play it again soon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
3 / 5 - Good

What I like about Brass is that it brings some genuine thematic feeling to the economic games genre, which renders it fairly unique. It is also undeniably deep. Unfortunately learning and playing the game is so vastly counter-intuitive (it's not that complex, it just messes totally with the sort of cause-and-effect chains usually seen in games) that I fail to see why, when there are soooo many games of this type around, I would spend the required time with Brass in order to get to grips with it properly. As usual with economic games, I'd rather play Puerto Rico instead.

Update: This could be anywhere between a 7 and a 9, and after two games it´s an 8 right now. There are a lot of things I like about it, but the ending is disappointing for a game of this length, strategies feel counterintuitive in light of the theme, and I have a few more other issues with it. I´m a little frustrated because it feels close to a really good game. I´m afraid a third game would see it become a 7 rather than a 9, but I´m ready to play again.

So far I've only played with the 2 player variant

What I like:
- Being able to use other people's resources, but it also helps them get income and VP
- The cards help limit choices a little bit to help reduce AP, but still provide enough openness to do what you want to do.
- The first half of the game is more focused on building up an income, and the second half is focused on scoring points.
- Some route building without being too open like in train games.

What I don't like:
- Theme is a little dry, but not that bad
- Game length is a little longer, so harder to get to the table
- Lots of rules make it hard to teach to others, although I don't think they're THAT bad.

It took me over a year to get this to the table, but it was worth the wait.  It's become our group's favorite game.

The theme is astonishingly well-integrated into the game.  Along with Twilight Struggle and 1960 this hits just the right balance in that department.  Everything in the game has a thematic reason for existing, but the gameplay was not sacrificed to strengthen the theme.  Whether or not any given player will find the theme even remotely interesting is another question--personally I find it very interesting indeed.

This gets a 10 because not only do I love playing it but I actively try to get it to the table.

06/22/13 Played a four-player game in 3.1 hours (after a 43 minute explantion). Poorly laid out and obtusely worded rules (a Wallace standard). A game aid sure would have helped. The board's graphics weren't bad, but they could have easily been better. The counters and cards were merely OK. The "smooth" money was as with all Wallace games of poor quality. Lack of player aids was galling. So my overall opinion was "eh". I'd be willing to play Brass again, but hopefully not for a quite a while, as it was a tiring experience.

I would have liked to give this '10' but there are smt. unexplainable missing which prevents Brass getting the all-time classic status. A great game anyway.
  Genious play mechanics
  Interesting economygame
- I would have axed the canal period and concentrated deeper on railroad period. 

Update: Four player game is still wonderful. However I really dislike 3-player game and will not agree to play Brass with only 3 players anymore. Rating dropped to '8' because of this personal strict requirement of 4 players.

I rather liked it. Of course, I played it horribly badly, but I liked the package altogether. Competing networks with rather severe blocking, and all sorts of delicious synergies and parasitism. A mean game that wasn't as complex as I feared. The two periods is also a very welcome and interesting element. You set the scene so to speak in the canal period, and then you reap what you sow in the rail period.

My only negative concern is the cards. They felt very constrained at times but I think that is the point, what I didn't like is how easy they can seem to screw you completely (albeit mitigated by good play, but then again, what isn't for any game of (some) skill) - but it is why I don't think Brass can ever surpass Age of Steam for instance even if it does a lot of things I like.

Quite a good game, in Wallace's upper tier.  Early the money is tight, like Age of Steam, and there is some nice planning necessary between the two major phases of the game.  Looks to be several ways to score points, and a need to manage your strategy dependent on your hand, but the hand can be overcome.  

A recent play (Nov '15) solidifies my earlier thoughts.  Very good game with the chance of screwage as well.  Use those loans in the right way!

About 5 plays of this so far. It's a fun economic game with some innovative mechanics. I just love the flipping mechanic, and I think it works perfectly here. It's not nearly as difficult to learn as people make it out to be. I blame that on obtuse rules and strange rule organization. One worry - are loans and cotton overly critical to this game? Can it be won without a heavy dose of both?

I'm rating it a 7 because I respect the design. My opinion of the game is more like a 5. I'm not sure what turns me off about the game, but it gives me a similar feeling that I get from Hansa Teutonica, which is another that I am very meh on. I think my biggest issue is with the cards. It seems like I was restricted quite a bit by my hand of cards, and I didn't find it interesting.

Extremely linear game; in fact without the cards it would probably play pretty much the same every time. The cards introduce some angst but it feels a bit gamey... kind of a workaround to making a game where otherwise there wouldn't be much else. Some rules are extremely fiddly and not very intuitive, making it easy to mistakenly forget when you are building. The economic system works and the way initiative is handled is also very interesting. Overall, doesn't provide enough bang for the buck for the amount of time the game takes.

I have mixed feeling for my initial play.  It's a unique take on a pick-up-and-deliver train game where players need to pay attention to the supply and demand that is generated through play.  One's actions on the board are somewhat dependent on the cards you hold.  In this way the game can be somewhat tactical at times.  My group never really moved that far up the income track and in fact those that concentrated on generating income fared poorly which is counter-intuitive with this sort of game.  However, I feel that this is also due to inexperience as it has a steep learning curve.  It certainly feels like a Wallace game so if you like his designs I'd say it's well worth checking out.  I look foward to playing again and seeing what I missed the first time around.  UPDATE: raised rating 1 point: there's a lot you can do with the cards and numerous routes to victory.  It's strategic but rewards bursts of tactical play well.  Very competitive and plenty to think about.

Impressive design.  Not that much in the way of rules, but a ton to try and get your arms around.  Does not have the death spiral of something like Age of Steam, but you can really shoot yourslef in the foot during the Canal Era.  I was surprised at how many victory points paths there are in the game.

Not remotely accessible for anyone but someone that enjoys gamers games.

Most important: My wife loves it :-)

I like it a lot myself but could not really say why. I guess really building up an economy is nice and using other peoples harbors, coal, and iron makes for quite some interaction.

I prefer this a bit over Age of Industry (which is almost the same game). I like drawing cards automatically and I like seeing the values printed on the chits (but of course not printing them on there increases flexibility).

One of Martin Wallace's better game designs.  Plays reasonably quickly once players have some experience with the game and are not AP prone.

Rewards both sharp tactical play and strategic planning.  Some concern regarding the importance of the location cards (a bad starting hand can really hamper a player) and the seemingly predominant race to build a shipyard.  Will need more plays to assess...

"Age of Industry is considered a streamlined Brass v2. The main difference for me was the mechanic of the 2 Eras, which I felt was a great mechanic -- which added an Area Control element to the Economic game. In this, Brass wins out over Age of Industry. I also enjoy the income track, providing a sense of growth and progression throughout the game."

What an amazing game. It's actually hard to describe. Brass does what Brass does very well. It's economic, it's engine building, it's hand management, it's network building, it's blocking, it's racing, it's working together, it's working apart. It's a masterpiece.

Un jeu de gestion/connexion remarquable par ses mécanismes et sa fluidité, mais difficilement accessible aux néophytes. Brass demande de gros efforts de concentration et de réflexion, car on sent au fil du jeu que la moindre erreur nous sera fatal.
Attention: la règle française est bancale et mérite d'être approfondie en consultant les différentes FAQ/clarifications qui traitent de ce jeu.

RATING: 9.9
Absolutely awesome game, fascinating range of choices, genuinely fun to play once you have a grasp of the rules.

The variability of the location/industry cards you receive just adds so much interest to your approach, as you have to adjust your strategy to deal with what you have been dealt. 

Hats off to Martin Wallace! Looking forward to playing this game more so than any other game in my group. I also rate this game higher than,the, in my opinion over hyped "AGRICOLA".

RATING: 8.8
Brass doesn't shine until it's been polished by repeated plays; it's a far more interactive game than meets the eye for beginners.

I don't get to play this nearly as often as I'd like.  Serious rewards for planning ahead, but you need to stay flexible and accept that you don't always get the cards you want, especially those critical iron works. 

(There was one game where my cards were so bad on the second turn that I took two loans rather than play any of them.  I did win that one, though ;-) )

This was my all time favourite in 2011 and earlier. Just a shame it doesn't stretch to 5 players (a common number for us) but hopefully age of industry will plug that gap when we get it to the table.

Played once with four players and twice with three.  

This is a game with a ton of rules; it took us an hour to get through all the rules, and even then we weren't clear on all of them (forgetting minor ones throughout the game).   A player aid would help greatly.  The game itself took three full hours to play, and given the amount of difficult decisions to make, I can't see the game time being reduced by much.  

The game is relatively simple in idea: players build technology in cities or connections between cities, and then get points based on how their technologies are used and how big the cities are that they connected.  

The meat, and it is delicious meat, is in the details: a number of the resources needed to build buildings are only available from other technology cards.  You need to use the resources, but using them gives other players points.  The game also has two ages, and so a lot of the technologies you build in the first age are wiped off the map, scoring no points in the second round (unless you build techs that stick around).  And choosing where to build things is difficult: you can only build things based on the cards in your hand, and while there is a lot of flexibility, planning your moves based on your cards is essential.  

There is a ton of meat in the game, and it seems like the board changes so much as you play that it should have lots of replayability.  My only concern is the time: I can't see the rules getting cut down much, and it is a full 3 hours.

[Update: After playing another game, this time with 3 players, I'm even more happy with the game.  Widely divergent strategies (high-income vs. boats vs. cotton shipping and low income) ended up with very close scores in a tooth-gnashing game.  I've raised my rating to 8.5]

Brass es un juego duro. El ambiguo libro de reglas deja demasiados puntos a la libre interpretación y el jugador novel se puede sentir desbordado en su lectura y comprensión. Se echan dramáticamente de menos ejemplos de mecánicas y resolución de rondas y fases. No es que sea un juego complicado en cuanto a reglas, la dificultad de las mismas radica en su explicación.

Complex. A gamers game. Interesting but not for me. I love Age of Steam, i tolerate Power Grid (not from M.Wallace, but just a comparison) which is a bit of a brainburner, but this one has gone too far. Complexity of rules and complexity of thinking is far behond my conception of this hobby. Martin Wallace is very good at building great mechanics with more or less theme (this one has not achieved the theme neither, IMHO), but keeping it more simple is the major asset of Age of Steam and of R.Tycoon. A challenging game anyway.

Birthday gift from Rachel. Amazing game. I no longer want to get involved in any of that 18xx stuff - this is deep enough. Probably the deepest economic sim I've played, yet still accessible.

I've only played online so far, and can see the game getting even better in real life due to negotiating where and with whom to undertake new development, etc.

I don't know how often I'll get to play this. I'm eager to try it. If it turns out good, I may substitute poker chips for the drab, ugly coins in the game.

I read through the rules. It's gonna take some time and patience to learn this one, I think.

First play was a 4-player game. Great game, rated an 8.

2-player game was pretty good too.

This was made obsolete by Age of Industry. Traded this (along with Factory Fun) for Bus and Merkator.

A great game, but getting over the initial rule hurdle is quite a feat.  I carefully read the rules and the clarifications here, but our first game we still played with 2 rules wrong.  The core problem is that the game is not extremely complicated, but there are little snipets of rules that is easily overlooked.  Once the rules are nailed, the game meshes well and is very challenging and fun.

Even though I'm closing in on 100 plays, I [i]still[/i] want to play this stellar game. Yeah, I've hit the century mark with other games, but those were all quick 20 minute affairs, whereas Brass clocks in at 2.5 or more hours face-to-face and spans about a week online. No other game has given me this much enjoyment over such an extended period of time. Brass has officially earned my first and thus far only 10 rating.

[b]50 Plays Ago:[/b] I'm coming up on 50 plays, and I'm shocked to find myself still interested in playing this fantastic game. It took me a dozen plays just to become basically competent, then probably another dozen plays to get my groove back after a long hiatus. The third dozen ironed out some forgettable kinks in my game, and this last dozen has been a glorious stretch of 1st and 2nd place finishes in competitive 4-player games.* That's quite a stretch of challenging play! I'm pretty sure the shine will wear off over the next fifty plays, forcing me to drop my rating, but Brass would still be the first heavy Euro that I played a hundred times. My highest compliments to Mr. Wallace for creating such a stunning game!

* The 3-player game is not where it's at. 4 players all the way.

I didn't realize this was a train game until too late (not a big fan of them).  The game is fairly ugly and has an uninteresting theme (to me).  It does have a nice economy system in it.  I like the different strategies you can pursue.

A really good, deep game which feels "fresh" compared to so many other Euros out there (I like the uniqueness of the tile-flipping mechanic as a requisite for getting income/points, and the two-age aspect, for example). There are lots of fiddly rules which tend to trip up first-timers (especially regarding the multiple confusing requirements around connected cities for various actions), but once you've got them down, the game really flows.

Brass is a deep, strategic game with a great wide difficult decision space.  The rules are fairly straight-forward, but it's hard to see know what you're supposed to be doing or whether you are doing it well.  It's a nut that's hard to crack - so it is quite challenging.  I think there's a lot of replay value in tactically dealing with the random card draws.

On the downside, the graphic design is really lackluster.  The production *quality* is good, but the aesthetics are boring.  You spend 2 hours placing tiles that look like every other tile. Sometimes you flip the tile to the other side (which mostly looks the same) - who thinks that is exciting?

I just found my new favorite game. I can't think of a game I would rather play than Brass. Martin Wallace has many fine game designs which seem to offer much more than a standard Euro game with a pasted on theme.  Even the pickiest gamers in our group have proclaimed Brass as one of their favorites.  Repeated plays have shown that there are multiple paths to victory. I like to try a little something different each time I play.  Some may say the cards make the game too lucky, but I find your cards in hand challenge you to adapt your strategy as you go.  My only wish was that this game allowed for more than just four players.

RATING: 6
A game for Euro-heads, much like AoS.  For Brass, Wallace has abandoned his trademark elegance in favor of complex systems and unintuitive gameplay.  Everything feels very random and a tad chaotic (due to the cards), and the players who can see through all of that the best will do well.  If, however, like me, you need the first half of the game to learn the ropes, you will be neatly hung by them.  Like Tinners Trail, there's a well thought-out economic engine in place.  Unlike Tinners Trail, though, it's been smothered with Eurogunk.  One of the many pleasures of a Wallace game is marveling at how the game system models the chosen theme (mining tin or copper in Cornwall, defending or conquering Byzantium, the Peloponnesian War), but the model here is opaque and the game suffers for it.

This being a Wallace game, I'd play it again, now that I've stretched my brain around the system. But aren't there other, more dynamic, more exciting, less excruciating Wallace titles in print?  I do think so.

A game that plays not unlike the example of the English language, in that almost every rule has an exception. Interesting game, nonetheless. Unable to scratch the surface of what is going on here in my single play.

A perfect example of a simple rule set that provides a ton of depth, and easily my favorite Martin Wallace game.

It's not often all my geek buddies agree but Brass is an exception: all of them love it.

There is little downtime even with 4, the components are really nice (except for the money), and best of all, NO AUCTIONS! I am so tired of bidding...

There are a lot of subtle rules to make teaching first-timers a nightmare, but once that hurdle is passed and players catch on (will probably take a full game or two), then they can enjoy a well-designed Martin Wallace economic masterpiece.

An extremely clever economic game. There are lots of options, and they are inter-related with each other. You can play your own game, but reading your opponent's position is vital. I like how there's no scripted plays in the first few rounds as you have to be creative about using the cards that randomly distributed to you. This is a game that would keep you thinking games after game. A timeless classic.

Lowering my rating yet again after 72 plays.  I prefer more variety and legitimate strategic choices in my economic CDGs.  Prefer Age of Industry, PowerGrid, Manifest Destiny or Urban Sprawl to Brass.  The rail strategy in the second half of Brass is broken unless you play the France or Catalonia maps which are not available commercially.  The only reason this stays above my average rating is due to the historical economic theme, which is a particular sweet spot for me.

Not a bad game.  I enjoyed the card play the game offers and the economics of the game made me want to get Railways of the World out again.  However, it did not do anything to set itself apart for me from games I already have played and it fell flat with my wife.  Gave it to a friend to try out.

RATING: 10
Brass is an all around excellent game.  Very deep, with lots of rewarding strategies and important tactical decisions.  There is a lot to wrap your head around in this game, and the fact that I feel that there is still much to learn really makes the game appealing.  I like the way that you can specialize in what you build and produce, but that the game situation always seems to be such that you want to build everything.

There are a few niggling issues, such as the weird Birkenhead rule, which are more annoying than anything else.  It can also be frustrating when, through the way the cards come out, someone can completely lock up Barrow-In-Furness or Birkenhead, thus ensuring that they build the ship there.  I have won once without building any ships, so we'll see if this is really an issue or not.  If you like deep, heavy games, this is definitely one for you.  An instant classic.

Do not be scared of the theme, this is one of the best games out there. It's simple to play, yet very difficult to master. This would be 10/10 if not for the occasional dice rolling that could potentially decide the winner. Then again that randomness does produce some excitement.

RATING: 7
In 18th century Lancashire, one is building canals in the canal phase, and putting down cotton mills, ships, coal and iron factories. In the rail phase, railroads are being constructed. Each player gets a hand of 8 cards, which dictates their choices of where to build, and what to build. 

It took us five hours to play one and half games and to blunder through all the rules. I must say, the rules could have been written better. There were examples afterwards that were rules that probably should have been put in the rules section. 

I think the game has some potential. All the Martin Wallace groupies will like this game, despite the poorly written rules. I'm happy to give this another try.

Good game.  I like historical simulator games.  I think that they teach you something.  I'm also finding out that I enjoy economic games and this is a good one.  Some pretty funky mechanics that take a bit of getting used to (the cards?), but really it's quite simple once I wrapped my brain around it.  It puts on the appearance of being quite deep, but I don't think this game is as deep as it lends others to believe.  To win, you simply must do several things.  The game leads you to believe that you can win through many different routes, but really there are several key options that simply must be taken to win.  Even so, I enjoyed this game.

I fell in love with Brass after the first play. More than 50 plays later, it still holds my interest. There is a subtle cooperation between players unlike any other game I've played--and not the type where we agree to kill the points leader and then duke it out ourselves.

In online play, I've repeatedly seen "the winning strategy" debunked by unintuitive and creative play. Brass paradoxically always feels familiar and fresh at the same time. At my best, I was rated 6th on Hammerite's website (Dec. 2009). This is, unfortunately, one game that plays much better online where I can think about each move carefully. It's not a game I'd like to play face to face because the downtime between turns can be atrocious even if your group is experienced.

Played a few times on the iPad, but that pales in comparison to playing the physical game, which I did for the first time last night.

The rules are much more clear when sitting in front of the board.

While I am admittedly a Martin Wallace fanboy, I consider Brass to be his one of his best. What makes it the best is the interaction between players industries. I may build a coal mine which you can use to build your railways, or I build a port and you build a cotton mill and use my port to ship your cotton. In both scenarios we both get points.

After having played hundreds of euro games and then playing Brass, I don't see why it's ranked so highly. Whereas, I felt like Caylus lived up to its reputation. Brass is a fine game, but with the amount of luck and asymmetry, feels like it should be ranked around the same level as Die Vulgari Eloquentia and not so close to the top 10.
-----------
Played it again.... It's really a lot of fun on all the levels, from luck of the draw to tactics to longer-term strategy. There are a lot of rules to remember, which might have detracted from my first play, but actually added to my second--rules that make thematic sense but are easily overlooked. Winning hinges on coming up with a plan to handle the advancement of the periods--which means being very clear on what happens to existing infrastructure and how things differ in the rail period.

Game has an area control feel to it. You need to claim space on the board so that your buildings will flip. Later in the game at least, I tended to look for moves that would allow a building to flip each turn. I took a loan early, but not after that. Once you get high in income, I'm not sure it's necessary.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Great tactical economic game with many paths to victory, where they key is to be able to read the overall situation and get the max out of the current needs. Some long term strategy is required too.

Problems: 
-> Too many little rules (Martin Wallace trademark)
-> Infamous manual (at least in French); you simply can't learn to play by reading it
-> Not 2 hours, but 2'30 o 3.
-> Bad design/graphic art

Even with this problems, it is a must-have (and must-play!) for any boardgame lover.

Even more, it's one of those games you love more and more each time you play.

RATING: 9
(I own Pegasus Spiele 'Kohle' edition)

There is a lot to like about the game. Cards limit your options just enough so you must adapt your plans accordingly but they are not limiting you too much. You must plan ahead your moves to make most of your precious actions. There is enough to think about while playing and also always so pleasant balancing between right mixture of income and points with your moves. There is also a bit of "co-operation" with other players. Sometimes you're able to build your buildings in such way that other players are more or less forced to use them and therefore give points and more income to you. 

I especially liked how the game has 2 different eras but they are still linked to each other in a subtle way. Most of the buildings (and all connections) in the first era will be gone by the second but not all. Some buildings can be built in the first era such that they give points twice or they just might be there to give you better position for second era. This is a bit similar to Amun-Re except you benefit from everything you have build on board at the start of a new era. Overall this is an excellent economic game.

Works equally great with 3 and 4 players. I'd still prefer full 4 players because of greater turn angst there is.

In a ruleset barely comprising six chock full pages, players are instructed about how to earn money and prestige by building and trading cotton in Northern England with the emerging technology provided by the industrial revolution; they have to slowly establish their own network of cotton plants, mines, shipyards, ports and iron works, connected by canals in a first phase and then by rail in the second and final phase.

The plot sounds very familiar to experienced German game players; nevertheless, Brass isn't the standard optimization game with a historical topic tagged on but a work of art. It seems that the game has been constructed on the basis of the plot:  every single aspect of it (dependencies among different buildings and materials, historical development, supply and demand issues) has been translated into the play in a more or less streamlined fashion. 

Yet again, Brass isn't a wargame - there are some exceptional little rules here and there, but they're all pretty understandable given the nature of the game and can be assimilated easily within its water tight system. Both phases of the game develop in a radically different way even though they follow the same principles. The way steady income and loans are implemented is especially elegant. Furthermore, there's much less luck here than in a wargame: even though the mostly tactical play is based on managing a hand of cards, the luck of the draw is minimized by the stunning flexibility with which cards can be used.

I recall no other game where the thematic background and a finely crafted set of rules are married as successfully as in Brass. It's long, demanding and it might take some effort to digest the rules at first, but at the end of it I couldn't care less - it feels like just having finished a good period novel.

RATING: 7.4
Altro bel gioco di Wallace! Un ferroviario riuscito (anche se a mo avviso non paragonabile ai 18xx o a Age of Steam, sia per profondità che per bellezza). Il gioco si divide in due fasi (periodi), nella prima i trasporti si basano sulla navigazione; sarà importante mettere delle solide basi per la seconda fase, rimanere indietro come punteggio non è così importante quanto essere ben posizionato sulla plancia. Nella seconda fase, con il potenziamento dovuto al trasporto ferroviario, si raccoglieranno i frutti di una buona pianificazione. Determinante sarà la produzione e la richiesta di carbone e acciaio. Brass è un gioco strategico e con diverse possibilità di vittoria; trovo nella mappa il vincolo di longevità con un paio di vie di commercio strozzate. Si potrebbe/dovrebbe pensare ad altre ambientazione (altre mappe come exp) per rendere le partite sempre nuove. Componente fortuna presente la pesca delle carte può seriamente condizionare una partita.

I wasn't overly impressed with my first game of Brass.  It was good, but playing it didn't feel like I had that many options or there was something restricting me from doing what I wanted.  
After playing though I kept thinking about it, lying in bed, or on the way to work and different strategies I want to try.

Now I've played it a few times, I can appreciate it a lot more.  Interesting mechanics of exhausting your tiles and the card hand management, in addition to the managing of money, and always not having quite enough to do what you want without having to take a loan, and then be in a position where you have to keep taking loans.

I really enjoy this one.

And it was great also!  Good tension, close game.  

Couple plays of this so far, both 4-player.  What a fabulous game!  Even with the horrible learning curve.  Our first game took almost 5 hours w/ various kid-related interruptions and when I decided to review the Commonly Forgotten Rules section, we had broken like 5 of them.  Our 2nd play clocked in at about 3 hrs and we only forgot a couple rules infrequently.  In our group, we are having trouble remembering to always play a card for an action and to check the coal supply when building with a city card.

Our 2nd game really brought out the strategy and timing issues as all 4 of us had 1 or 2 unflipped cotton mills at the end.   The foreign market was all tapped out and we realized it wasn't worth building another port just to have someone else gain even more points from immediately selling cotton through it.  If I had gone heavy cotton mill while the others were still fighting over the level 2 shipyards (the other 3 all ended up w/ one spot), I maybe could have beat them to the rush.  I ended up scoring 70 off of tracks and only lost by 5.  3rd place was only 3 pts behind me and the player burned the worst by the cotton mills was 13 behind 3rd place.  

So great strategy still emerging.  Lots of market timing and balancing $ vs. victory points.  Great purchase although the learning curve and infrequency of playing partners with hours of time will sadly prevent this from getting played as much as I would like.

Played once after having spent considerable quality time with the rules beforehand. I'm in the process of creating a player aid / play summary which will hopefully help with many of the rules questions. Mostly the rulebook is fine, it's just not laid out in what (for me, at least) was a completely logical progression. When teaching this I started very high level and gradually drilled down to the details - the rules themselves tend to swing from 'big picture' to 'little picture' too often, which makes following them more difficult than it should be.

Update 9 Sept 2008: Have played several more times since I wrote the above.  I like this game very much - it provides multiple paths to victory, lots of engaging gameplay and player interaction.  Probably my second-favourite Wallace title after Age of Steam.

Wow! Martin Wallace on top form.

Like PR and St Petersburg Brass is an "Income/VP engine building" game where you need a decent income to have any chance of winning, but at the same time you need to generate points to win. So you're constantly having to weigh up whether you're going to build industries which generate cash but provide few victory points (such as coal mines), or vice versa (e.g. shipyards).

The game plays more like Power Grid or RRT because network building is a key mechanic, only with a more developed economic model. There’s also some hand management and resource management (as well as the obvious money management). If you like that sort of thing then you will like Brass.

It’s currently one of my favourite games, but the money is really crappy (tiddlywinks) so I replaced them with poker chips.

Excellent economic game. There are many ways to win, but you have to pay attention to what other are doing and get your timing right. Very rich game, which doesn't bore me after many (online) plays (which I don't log here).

Martin Wallace's masterpiece. Brass looks extremely dry and dull (it kinda is) but the experience holds so much more than cube-pushing and bland victory-point mechanics! In short, Brass is an economic simulation game set during the Industrial Revolution in England. While that sounds like every boring historical Euro about medieval families and wood gathering, Brass is unique in theme, strategy and concept. The secret to doing well in Brass is timing: exploiting "the market" (your opponents) and supplying resources for their industries, cleverly propelling you to victory. There has been an argument that Martin Wallace's games are the least and most thematic of today's game designers. From my view, Wallace dispenses with the flavor text and cheap theatrics of other historical Euros and instead builds the theme directly into the core mechanics of the game, creating a more believable and enriching experience than your typical-scramble-for-victory points Euro. You'll be thrown into the mind of an enterprising industrialist, tactfully building a network of coal, iron, cotton mills and canals for the most money and prestige. While the rulebook and the game itself can be clunky and counterintuitive at first, after one or two rounds, game play should flow well and strategies should emerge quickly after the third. (I would still recommend playing with someone who has played it once or watching a game play video before, though. It was a bear to learn.) Let me say this: Brass is undeniably Wallace's best game and maybe the best economic game. Ever. I'll explain: there are very few games that let players choose and build their own path to victory. While not exactly a sandbox (a free-for-all for engine-building), Brass has several strategies and tough decisions for players to make throughout the entire game. The optimal strategy is about timing: anticipating your opponents' moves, building where you're going to be needed, and knowing when the market is "dry." While the game isn't as easy to learn and accessible as London (my favorite of Wallace's before I played Brass), the experience of Brass is extremely rewarding and you'll want to play again as soon as you see the point spread at the end!

Great economic game. I like the developing system, the tactics on the board, the hand management, the balance among the industries, the turn order mechanic. That's my Wallace of choice.

RATING: 8
Quite a few games in and I'm delighted with the way the game plays out differently each time, and the ever-shifting balancing between pursuing strategic investments and taking advantage of opportunistic tactical investments. I've seen both loan-heavy and loan-free strategies work (each dependent on the situation), cotton strategies, coal/iron and shipyard strategies work, so the game balance seems good for a complex game. The one aspect I'm not so enamoured with is the sameness from game to game on the same map with the same cards, same strategies, standard openings, all coming to bear. All of which is the reason I've kept Age Of Industry over Brass - the former may not be as tightly woven, but I prefer the map variety for a similar gameplay experience.

A tough gamers' game. Unlike anything I've played, even Wallace's train games. Seems very tactical. The basics are simple; the particulars are the meat of the game: knowing what to do when, and hopefully before other players think of doing it too. Not the easiest game to teach. AP alert!!

Excellent economic game. Great tension throughout and I like the different feelings of the two ages. The game is more tactical, which I prefer, but still has a decent amount of strategy to guide your overall game. I am a little concerned about replayability over the long term but it has been a lot of fun so far.

This is a complex game and in your first game, especially in the first Era, it is easy to forget about certain aspects and rules. In the first round, you must spend wisely and try and move up the money track as best you can while also placing the right tiles to maximize points, borrowing money at the correct times. Don't be too worried about helping others a little, if it helps you more. Once you enter the second Era, you must seek out your best option for making points and money, balancing the two in order to overstep your opponents. There can be a lot of downtime so chose your opponents carefully and some of the rule intricacies are easy to forget at first. However after a few plays I am hooked, one of my favorite Wallace games.

RATING: 9
This game is pure excellence in boardgame design. The interplay between the different industries and the way that players can use each other's coal and iron make for some very interesting strategies. The two phase game with scoring at the end of each phase is very interesting in the way that it 'resets' the board to a certain extent and the player order controlled by the amount of money spent each turn give the players an awful lot of control about timing their moves. The way that income works is also intriguing and the fact that other players can score you point and income by using your industries means that you can’t just play the game in a silo. You’ve got to be aware of the other players to ensure that you’re industries will get used when you want them to and that you don’t end up over competing in one area when there is a niche that could be filled more easily, that would score you more points with less competition.

I have thoroughly enjoyed every game I’ve played of this so far and I don’t see that changing any time soon.

A masterpiece.  One of those games that makes 2+ hours fly by.  I have heard some Brass fans have abandoned ship in favor of Age of Industry.  I have not tried Age of Industry, but I know how hand management is much less of an issue in AoI than in Brass.  But the hand management is one thing in Brass I really like and I know I would like the game less if that aspect were scaled back.  The drawback to the card system in Brass is that it does not support expansion maps.  But the map that comes with Brass is fine by me and I really don't need expansions.  

UPDATE: I tried Age of Industry finally. My suspicions were correct. Brass is clearly better.

Brass gives a very satisfying feeling of participating in a diverse and developing economy. I love the way supply and demand fluctuate. Beautifully thematic. 3 or 4 players. 

Brass is a deep and brilliant game. How many games combine commodity production, manufacturing, and transportation successfully? In Brass, each player's production engine is inescapably tangled up with every other players' production.  There's no multiplayer solitaire here.

And the multitude of  possible strategies: specialization in one commodity, diversification across multiple industries, or two complimentary strategies (such as cotton and ports), all of which give victory points and income.  What ever you build, you must have synchronicity: transport links between your industries. Buying an expensive cotton mill and not being able to flip it is a painful lesson in economics (the cardboard variety). What Brass all adds up to is more potentially winning strategies than any other economic game I've played.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It does seem like the game tries to bury you early for your lack of income, once you get going in the mid-game, it's actually a lot of fun.  The game does seem counter-intuitive at points though, and I think I'd have trouble explaining it, especially to someone who wasn't familiar with Age of Steam.  While the system as a whole is very solid, there are a ton of little rules that can be hard to remember.

This is such a brilliant game that is a really hard sell to anyone that's not into euros. The game is incredibly thematic, tense and even though you're not working together, you get the feeling you all rely on one another to keep the gears moving. A bit fiddly and some corner cases with the rules, but once you get the largest action down, you know 90% of the rules. I prefer this with 3 or 4, but the 2 player map is still interesting. Lots to sink your teeth into even with the same board layout. Having different cards in hand really changes up the gameplay as well as having someone else building a certain industry before you. Suddenly coal or iron is less lucrative then before.

Extras: Cards are sleeved in Maydays Premium Euro? sized sleeves. Also, I have a hard mounted 2 player map to allow this game to go from 2-4 players.

Brilliant game. Rules are relatively simple, but the strategy is deep and the decisions are many. The theme is very interesting and integrated well with the mechanics.

Only two times yet, so rating might go down with more plays. The first time was a 3-player game and I was just having so much fun exploring the game, I did not care about forming a decent strategy. For some reason, I did not end up last. The second time around I was more aware of things, but the other players were more experienced - I came in last in a 4 player session. But I had a great time nonetheless.  

I love the whole "flipping" tiles thing and at the end of the game, I did get that feeling that I had accomplished something. There are some things to think about, and although it definitly has some quirky rules, I don't think the game where that hard to grasp. Ok, it is complex, and I was glad that I had the game explained to me rather than learning the rules by myself. But at least it felt intuitive most of the time.

2/17/10: One of my favorite euro games.  For some reason, I love the tile-flipping aspect; it gives the game a unique feel, instead of feeling like any other euro.  The game is very tense and has the right mix of luck (in what cards you draw) and strategy.  I like how the different industries depend on/interact with each other.  Money can be very tight in the game, but not unforgivingly so.  Actions are probably even more valuable than money.  The rulebook can be somewhat hard to unpack, but I learned it just by reading the rulebook and have successfully taught it to several people, so it can be done.  Highly recommended.

On the downside, the rules continue to be sort of annoying, with all the little details one has to remember, and make the game seem much harder to learn than it should be. 

On the plus side, it's a complex game, with a lot of interesting decisions and some great ideas. I really like the 2 distinct phase and the neat balance between setting up your economic engine and growing your distribution network. The way technology is implemented is also very well thought out. I don't especially like the cards but they don't bother me either.

There's a definitely a learning curve to climb, but it can be a very rewarding experience. The strong bindings among players and the complex framework provide for a lot of interesting tactical choices each turn. Like other great games (Puerto Rico comes to mind) it's crucial to have a long term plan, but one suited for the game being played. It's equally crucial to have the ability to adapt and rethink things.

Wallace really needs to hire someone to develop his games! A virtual link?? Come on...

An ordinary economy game with some twists and exceptions. A bit too long because of its easily triggered AP effect.

We played with four players and at times the board was really crowded. That's a problem because of those connections. Only one player can build a connection between two places. This matters only while expanding but still...

The cards are their own chapter. A bad hand can really mess your game. Ok, there is a lot of chances to alter the hand and it's been made a bit less handicapping element and still I had some problems at times. Probably it was just me...

A good economic game for those enjoying that genre. For myself, just an "ok" game.

I really thought I was going to enjoy Brass more than I did. It's an economic game in which you're building up industries and linking them to ports through railways and canals. It is one of the few games that are classified as "heavy" that really felt that way to me-- it kind of felt draggy as I agonized over what to do next. I've generally enjoyed Wallace's games, but this one is not for me.

Played many times, and it is excellent.  It has the trademark design aspects of Martin Wallace games, with complex interlocking resources and many paths to success.

Cards provide a subtle but still real luck element, as they allow/limit choices on what to develop and where.

This is a well-made and challenging game, although it sometimes gets convoluted because of some persnickety rules. However, you have to appreciate how it takes economics, rails, and income tracks into a coherent game. At first, it was not my sort of stuff, mostly because of brain burning decisions. But once I saw the tight supply and demand chain, I really started to love this game. It's rare for me to give a low score first and then a high score after several more plays. But I went from hating this game to absolutely loving it.

I wanted to like this game; I really did.  It shares a lot in common (at least thematically) with several other Euro games that I enjoy.  But playing it was non-intuitive, the rules were dense and badly written, the board was in some places too small to actually lay the pieces in the required places and ultimately it was one of the most frustrating games I've ever played.
There's a good game in there - but I do feel that the rules need streamlining so that the game itself can come out.

Even though we played it wrong (REALLY WRONG) the first time, I absolutely love this game.  This is the first Wallace game I've played and it inspired me to buy more (Tinner's Trail).

I would give it a higher score, but it is blemished slightly by the rules - it seems like a lot of people get these wrong somehow (including us), which to me seems like the design is flawed slightly - I guess I'm saying they're not quite elegant enough?  It's only a minor gripe though.

This an excellent game, that totally rubs me the wrong way. This could end up a 10 if I can get over what I don't like about it, or a 6 if it proves to be too frustrating. An 8 seems to fit now, as I would always want to play Brass, but I will also always expect to be at least a little disappointed.

I love how much strategy and tactics there are to consider, and it's not likely that any one way to play becomes dominant, as your best bet is to do things others don't. Lots of avenues to explore, little edges to gain. You have to make a plan and stick to it, and yet react to what happens around you.

It's really hard and often frustrating to deal with all the lovely little pulls and pushes that the game and other players provide, as you're limited by the cards you get. Oh, the cards! If there's one thing I hate in games, is rules that tell you what you can't do, rather than what you can. And the sole reason for the cards in Brass is to limit your options.

You've been dealt a hand of cards that's really difficult to put to good use. Do you a) cut your losses and make a move that's strictly worse than what your opponents are doing, just so you can make the best use of suboptimal cards, or b) throw those cards away and make a move that will be the most beneficial if the next cards happen to be better. Both will likely end in frustration.

I realize that if you're good at Brass, you can mitigate bad draws to some extent. But Brass is not an easy game. It's difficult enough if the cards work with you, rather than against you. It's a long game, too, and promises so much, so there's a lot that can be ruined by frustrating hands.

I'm not saying it's too random, or that lucky players will beat good players. One might argue that there are no really bad hands, and that the most important skill in Brass is making the most of what you're dealt. But it's simply not fun when you've figured out what you want to do and the cards tell you that no, you can't do that, you'll have to do something else, sorry. 

----
6 games in, I find the cards much less frustrating, although a bad hand can still cost you the game. Wonderful game, but more in an "interesting" than "fun" way.

An overly convoluted variant of the brilliant Age of Industry. Plus, it has no ship, no factory, no sea lanes, no distant market with import or export, no need to draw cards, and a regular income, and guess what: only ONE official map! What a joke! Seriously, AoI is as serious as Brass, but more varied and not needlessly complicated.

This is an interesting economic game, where players build factories and ship goods. The game has elements of a logistics game, but the more crucial element is budgeting and timing. In essence, you get a hand of cards. On your turn you get 2 actions, with each action requiring you to play or discard a card. You can build in a city that matches the card you have, or build with a special card in a city you have a link to from your previous things. Most of the buildings get populated with cubes. The cubes get spent when you or other players take actions, and when the building is empty, it flips and generates points and income. Halfway through the game, all the connections wipe, and players have another chance to build connections. It really does a fantastic job of capitalizing on other player's work, but still advancing your own cause.

It makes my head hurt, but in a good way. Good balance of long-term strategy and opportunism, and a really clever economic system. I just wish it was easier to see which tiles have been flipped at a quick glance.

Online play has improved my opinion of this one significantly. It really is a masterful economic simulation.

After ~10 online plays, I have upgraded this to be my third 10-rated game. I had expected games might become samey, but the variance introduced by the cards keeps it remarkably fresh.

An interesting Martin Wallace game. Lot's of mechanisms to score points. Looking forward to repeat play, its hard to see the interplay on the first try.

After the second game I found the rule exceptions a pain to remember. They make the canal era different from the rail. I constantly made mistakes because of the rules which affected my strategy. This isn't a knock against the game per se, it just takes numerous plays to master.

One 3-player and one 4-player game. Terrific game with lots of choices, action, and ways to score. Not a lot of screwage but opportunities exists. The ship builds in the 3 ports are very powerful and obvious, canals/tracks are at least as powerful but less obvious (for the 1st game anyway). Want to play again soon.

Canal Phase: Build a 2 counter in at least 2 of the 'biggest' cities and try for connections to them an the 2VP edges. Flip every 1 counter after taking at least 3 30 loans.
Rail Phase: Build connection from the 'biggest' cities. Build 2 rails/action as much as possible.

A very good economic building game. Can very much see ideas from Age of Steam. It is more forgiving and the development of the 3 major industries, ports, shipping and transportation links feel thematic.

I like how the victory points are counter balanced against income, and how the game forces you to discard to either employ options or get better options. The inclusion of cards, along with what the other players are doing can force you into different plans.
The 2 phase approach with the cleaning of the board after the canal phase allows you change strategies in mid stream.

Like how there are several ways to pursue VPs which seem to be the value of what you set up during the game. A transportation strategy, Cotton/port, coal iron .... All in all a quite deep game.

Altough I'm not mastering very well that game, it's probably, with Tinner's Trail, my favorite Martin Wallace game. The only downside of it would be the randomness of the city cards. The rules are typical Wallace rules, very hard to understand for a generaly not so difficult type of game. The material is not bad at all, only the graphic art could have been better. A must game for hardcore Euro gamers.

Même si je ne maîtrise pas encore bien ce jeu, c'est probablement avec Tinner's trail mon jeu favori de Martin Wallace, le seule petit hic de ce jeu est le côté aléatoire de la pige des cartes de villes. Les règles sont du Wallace typique, soit très dures à comprendre pour un jeu relativement simple. Le matériel n'est pas mauvais du tout et seule le design graphique aurait pu être mieux. Un ''must'' pour tout les joueurs de gros jeux Euro.

After one play of Brass, I'm not that interested in ever playing again. To start with, the game just looks drab and ugly, the rules are tough to digest and learn, and the lack of any sort of player aid seems a major omission. The components are also fairly lacking, in particular the money just felt very lame to me. 

But then the actual gameplay is only alright. The interaction between the players in what buildings you want to use and where to place is nice. I enjoyed that. But I found the card mechanic to be very annoying and entirely unnecessary. The majority of the time you are able to take whatever action you want as you'll have a card that will let you build whatever you want the most. But in my game I had several moments where Coal or Iron was in extreme demand and it seemed to me that the best play would be to build one of those buildings....and yet I couldn't because I could not get a card that would let me do it. So while my opponents had hands that were allowing them to take whatever action they thought was best, I couldn't. 

Now I get the argument is that part of the strategy and decisions in Brass are to learn to deal with your hand and make the best use of it, I think it's just an awful mechanic that makes things no fun for me. If the cards are only very rarely going to prevent me from taking the action I most want to, then isn't a lot of the game just finding out who isn't getting screwed by the deck? I guess the better question for me is how the game is improved by the cards--it seems a perfect mechanic to simply cut out of the game. 

Finally, I also just didn't like the fact that Coal had to be transported but Iron can just apparently teleport wherever it is needed. Seemed very strange, and overall the theme didn't help with the mechanics at all. In other words, most of the rules really made no intuitive or thematic sense. 

Overall I came away not impressed by this game.

In a perfect world, I would play this often. As it stands, I owned this game for a few years and it never got a nibble from my group, largely because it is yet another game that requires sacrificial plays so that the whole table can have really satisfying games only after gaining valuable experience. To be more than fair to my group, they trusted me on quite a few different train games that also required a clumsy learning game before the real enjoyment could happen, and you can only sacrifice so many weeknights. 

My single game of this was online and I had no idea what was happening. I normally enjoy and am drawn to opaque games like this but, for someone in my position who plays multiplayer games maybe once a month, we only "need" about 5 options for the "60-90 minute opaque & deep game that rewards replay, is wildly interactive, and allows for creative play & surprises." 

It's economic, requires hand management, and necessarily intertwines everyone's fate since you all create the collective economy: all things I ought to love. It remains an odd man out, and I do not regret getting rid of my copy.

Mar 2016: An early 25th anniversary gift from Althea - who would have thought 25th was Brass? It is the reprint that has the 2-play board so I expect we'll play that side more often.

Oct 2016: Played the iOS lots and it has caused rules issues. I need to sit and learn it without auto-maintenance. The income verses points-earned timing is 'odd'. It could shift 0.5 either way once I've gotten 2-3 cardboard plays.

Feb 2017: Played with Jacob and I'm granting the rating bump. We had a great game (3-player) and I want more plays.

Apr 2017: I do not like the 'Version choice' the BGG Admins enforced. I am not happy that the Wallace-EGG-Roxley argument is embedded in my collection. I do not own "that Lancashire game" and I don't want to see the art for something not on my shelf. I own BRASS. Why is this decision different from 'Through The Ages' - it has two entries...

Yet another cube pushing, economic engine game.

And as with games that require to build this to get this resource to get this resource to get this resource to finally get a VP, it suffers from the typical faults of that genre:

* Not particularly interactive -- unless you think Puerto Rico is interactive. The interaction is more consequential than intentional: You block your opponent or take a resource that an opponent needs because you really need it, not because you want to attack who's in the lead.

* There is a rich-get-richer syndrome in this one, which is exacerbated by having players share the same map. Building rules generally do not allow you to build anywhere you want: you can only expand. (The game does allow you to build anywhere, at a great cost.) Consequently, if you get shut out of the high scoring areas of the board, you're pretty much screwed.

The reviews make it sound way more complicated than it is. To win, you have to build as many of your own tiles on the board. However, for them to score, they have to be connected to one or more other tiles on the board. That's it!

Since it's a Wallace game, expect lots of convoluted rules that you will screw up during your first game. Really, this game could have been easily streamlined, which would have probably enhanced its strategic depth. The game is much lighter than most reviewers and comments would lead you to believe.

Other cons:
* The cards you are dealt with greatly restrict what you are able to do -- particularly where you can build.

* Downtime is longer than it should be because of how restrictive it is to where you can build. Compare this game to La Citta. In that game, you can plan exactly what you have to do to optimally score the most points. However, if an opponent takes an action card you need, you'll have to replan your move. Same thing with Brass. If an opponent builds on the last space you want to occupy, then you'll have to replan your move from the start.

Its well made and for those that like economic games I think that it is held in high regard. The way the cards are discarded to facilitate actions is cool. Trying to combo the two actions together can be interesting as well. 
I was enthralled by the game for several plays but eventually the mechanics lost their appeal and the dry theme grated on me. It started to feel like every game was the same and every choice was boring. Turn something into something to make some money and then do a variation of that again. 
It also lacked any sense of humor. Games don't need to have that but it could have saved it. 
In short, over time every choice felt humorless, themeless, and unexciting so I gave up on it. 
It really is beloved by its fans so taking in their thoughts along with mine would give a more balanced view.

After one play with all new players, it went better than I expected.  We screwed up some pretty basic rules that will be corrected in a replay.  After playing it properly, my rating will likely improve.  

Brass is filled with so many options.  It's highly tactical too.  Plans formed at the end of one turn are easily thwarted by other players.  It's neat to have cards in such a luckless game too. Economic engine games are not usually well suited for a deck of cards, but they work very well in Brass.

I love that as the game happens the players only keep track of income, but income does not necessarily translate into victory points.  The player with the highest income can have the lowest score.  I love games that do that.  Losing sight of the real goal of the game can be enjoyable, but it doesn't help you win.  Since it isn't clear who is winning until scores are calculated, it's easy to think you are winning and enjoy yourself even if you are in last place.  I like that!

Simply put, this is the game by which I judge all other games.  Brass is a terrifically tight, incredibly well balanced economic game that demands strategy to win, but also requires flexibility and opportunism.  While it is one of the most competitive games you'll ever play, Brass also requires you to rely on, and play off of, the strategies of your opponents.  This means that every game evolves in its own unique way, keeping the game very fresh and rewarding repeated plays.  Closing in on 100 games played online, I'm still trying to figure out how best to optimize my play, and that is what makes Brass so great.

Seriously heavy economic game with very interesting progression of game play due to the Canal and Rail phases. The cards are the right balance of random and strategic, but my main gripe is that the cards may just dictate you do the same thing as the last game.

Good game but I don't recall loving it so much that I had to play it again esp with the hype all over it.  Then again, the reviews did say that the depth of the game comes in once you played a few times.

I am learning to appreciate it via playing on the app. Decent economic business game but can get abit try at times.

RATING: 9
A quite heavy economic game with a strong spatial aspect. I really like that the economy has very clever supply/demand structure: Players consume and at the same time provide coal and iron. Furthermore cotton mills generate demand for shipping. Furthermore, there is even some kind of capital market, in which you can take out loans and have to pay interests for the remainder of the game.

One on hand it is good to have a big network of connections to increase your oppurtunities to build things (and gain a lot of points with these connections), but you could also  easily piggy-bag on other players  networks for cotton shipping or getting ressources to building sites.

I really like the map, because it has some outstanding features (hub regions like Manchester, regions with ports, only limited and not easy-to-get-to  places for ship yards) and the possible connections change when switching to railroad area. 

Having two different eras is a neat twist. The first era is pretty much about setting you up (board position and income generation) for the second one, in which you score most of your victory points. However, this two ear mechanism and how to switch from income generation to victory  point generation makes this game rather hard for new players.

Update: 9 -> 9.5 After 10 plays I still like Brass a lot. Keeping the game from a perfect 10 is the chance of having really bad luck with the card draw, which may take you out of the competition for the win. That being sad, I have not had this problem in recent games (though other players had). So maybe you just have to play well enough to mitigate this luck of draw. I will pay attention to this in the next 10 plays.

Everyone tells me I'm crazy for not liking this game. Might have to be talked into another game.

UPDATE: So I played a second game of Brass years after the first, and I liked it significantly better. I think I like Age of Industry better, due to the different maps and the lack of the canal age. But I would happily play this again.

Took 3+ hours to learn before just the initial play. There are too many "exceptions" to the rules (mods based on play testing?) to make the game intuitive to pick up. However, the game seems incredibly balanced with many ways to win. Tile placement, route building, budgeting. I can tell it has great potential, but it has not felt "fun" yet. Perhaps Age of Industry will be better for me.

Very busy Wallace economic game.  There is s LOT going on and the play is very open.  I expect my rating to increase with subsequent plays once I have grasped mechanics and am ready to focus more on strategy - upped to a 10 after more plays - a game that keeps getting better.  The thene is well integrated in the art work, less so in actual game play.  I think you need to get a solid 10 plays under your belt before you know what you are doing - then you can worry about how to become good at the game.

By far the best euro/economic game I have played. The game is strategically deep and rewarding. Replayabilty is very high due to random card draw and all the little things affecting your strategy. Adaption is the key here. You have to look for opportunities and try to make the best of your very limited actions. The only thing that doesn't make this game a 10 for me is that the end game is a bit too calculative for my taste. Still, I have never felt during the game that I'm calculating too many things but I'd say that the best player will most likely win the game. Usually with euros , the guy who calculates most accurately is the winner. Takes a few plays to grasp how you should play the game but takes forever to truly master.

Euro game with lots of strategies for players to take. Elements of luck as the cards picked can determine your options possibly more than they should, but perhaps its down to the player to make the best of the situation.
Would like to play again.

I played this once at our games club, back in early 2013. I'd previously played (and disliked) Age of Industry, which I knew was a fairly minor reworking of this game, so my hopes weren't high. But then, I played AoI very early in my exposure to modern games, and definitely wasn't ready for a moderately complex game such as this one. I certainly didn't hate playing Brass - and even managed to win the game convincingly, against 2 others who clearly knew the game, although I certainly don't think they knew too much about how to play well. I would actually be interested in playing again, so can justify rating this as high as 7 - but there was nothing particularly interesting going on, and I can't see the replayability being that high (despite the fact that the play is entirely driven by cards which are randomly drawn, as most of the actions can be done with any card, and those which require certain types usually have a wide choice such that you'll usually be able to do what you want from your 8-card hand). It's certainly a bit of a mystery to me why this is as high as 20-something in the BGG rankings (and I've been around long enough to remember when it was in the top 10) - almost certainly I'm missing some depths that may become clear on repeated plays. But it's unlikely I'll ever play this many more times, and I wouldn't feel like I was missing all that much if I never played again. A game I can see some interest in, and which I'd happily play again, but without being hugely enthusiastic about either.

I want to love Brass, but the cards and the luck-of-the-draw are its downfall.

My initial impressions of Brass were quite negative. But user photocurio made a comment that inspired me to look into this again:
[i]"Brass is fiddly of course, but it offers something rare in Eurogames: an organically developing marketplace driven by supply and demand."[/i]

As a result, I tried playing this game online (PBWeb) here: [url]http://brass.orderofthehammer.com/[/url]
Dozens of games later, I appreciate Brass' subtleties. I still find it fiddly but Brass has really grown on me.

Apenas meia partida, por isso a nota provisória de 7. Mas achei bem promissor. Tenso, apertado, com furação de olho do jeito que eu gosto (bloqueios e antecipações, mas sem perda de unidades ou de recursos). As cartas são importantíssimas, e um jogo vai ser sempre diferente do outro graças a elas. Traçar sua tática para a rodada com base na sua mão é o que achei mais divertido. Acho que vou gostar ainda mais das próximas vezes.

(+) Very nice and interesting player interaction
(+) Deep strategic management game bursting with opportunities for players
(+) Original, rewarding and clever gameplay
(+) The game 'grows' on you, as the replay value is high, but also during one session things keep getting more interesting resulting in tight and exciting end-game situations.

(-) Some overly complex and not very intuitive game rules makes learning and teaching the game quite a burden
(-) Quite some downtime as you wait for opponents to think about their moves
(-) Dutch rulebook is really bad, don't use it! The English rulebook is better but it is still a pain to use: very bad manual indeed!

I had a terrific time my first game.  This is my 2nd Wallace game to play, and I'm appreciating how much he manages to pack into his games.  The basic structure of the rules seems more elegant than Age of Steam--basically, each player takes a turn playing 2 cards, and some housekeeping is done after each round.  Unfortunately, this elegant structure is riddled with lots and lots of small rules that sound like they all have purposes, but it's a shame it couldn't be streamlined out.  In the end, Age of Steam comes out looking very, very elegant compared to the slew of rules in Brass. (And Age of Steam isn't *that* elegant a ruleset!)

But never mind,  after the hour or so that it takes to learn how to play Brass, things flow more or less smoothly.  And it's a terrific, original game.  It feels very very organic.  I like the way things develop over time, new technology replacing the old, but history having important impacts.  There is so much packed into this game, I feel a little at a loss to describe properly the feeling of playing it.  It is so intense that I ended up with a raging headache by the end of the game, and still I was enthralled.  There were a lot of anguished sighs from all players during play. I imagine the Circle of Suicide in Dante's Inferno sounds like our game.  My initial impression is that it's a very hard game, quite mysterious at first, but also a fine and strict teacher, as it punishes mistakes with brutal rapping on the knuckles, and lets you know exactly what you did wrong soon after you do it.  I feel much, much wiser after my first play and can't wait to try my luck again with The Teacher.

After two plays I'm really excited about Brass.  I held out for a long time because of mixed reviews, but am thrilled I finally pulled the trigger.  Great mix of mechanics and tough choices.  Only problem is the degree to which it leads to AP in some players.  So many possibilities to calculate.

5/2011 - I've now played 20 games, mostly online.  What a great game.  Very strong Euro.  Definitely AP prone toward the end of each age.

rating after 1 play (4pl) - 5/6

hmm puzzled by how this is so highly rated/weighed.For some reason i had thought this was a long, deep game. instead it is a quite shortish (1.5hrs) qu shallow game. it is basically a dressed up card game with ur hand deciding or undeciding ur gameplan. it feels v clunky and v inelegant and really quite shallow - there is little room for strategic depth and what paths there are all seem to equalize in the end. it is fairly seductive to play but i really dont see the appeal

RATING: 7
It's fascinating watching the the various interlocking pieces of this game shift and flip and evolve as the game moves along. I like the income track and the way loans are dealt with. I like the logistics of building up a network and delivering goods. I like the soft reset between the scoring rounds representing different ages.

However, Brass is the exact opposite of elegant. I don't mind complex games, but I like fairly unified elements to help navigate the complexity. Having each different type of good behave differently is an example of this. Goods behave this way, except this one is different, and this one is different still. Cotton flips a port, but nothing else does. Iron instantly ships if there is space on the iron chart, but cotton takes an additional action to ship. Ships flip instantly, but ports don't. So many little exceptions makes it feel like the designer couldn't get the base game to work and had to keep putting in patches to keep it afloat.

Challenging game on the Industrial Revolution.  A lot of elements to think about on every turn:   cash on hand, turn order, whether to take a loan, income vs. VP potential, whether you have the cards you need for your plan, etc.

I really like this game. I have not yet played a game where I felt competitive (or was competitive for that matter). I'm still getting the hang of playing things to flip them later. I hope to play more and get the hang of it. Still very intriguing.

N.B. I did win game four. I assure you it will not make me cocky.

A really, really good game for fans of heavier, strategic games.  I had a lot of fun for half the game.  In the end, I have to realize that this is the poster child for that class of games that's been vexing me so badly lately: "Games I Wish I Could Love, But Can't."  Ultimately, the planning is too long-term for my brain to wrap around.  I end up inevitably doing badly at these kinda of games (18XX is the gold standard) with no clue at all where my game went wrong or how any of my individual decisions resulted in my final score.  I end up feeling dumb after this type of game, and that's a very real ego hit.  So, it's a great game, just not one I'll want to beat myself up with very often.

UPDATE: I did better this last time.  I don't know whether playing with the right rules was the difference (we originally failed to charge one iron for each developed tile), but I had a much better time in this game, even before it was clear I was winning.  So, I'm willing to give it a chance.

RATING: 8.6
A good (and with ugly artwork) game of strategy and economic management, with rules that are not too difficult to learn. It´s extremely complex to play well this game, with mechanics that work perfectly. Its only weak point is its artistic aspect (improved in its new edition), which could be a little more elaborate, although I think the designer was looking for to be clear and focus on the gameplay, and not to create a nice-looking boardgame. Anyway, this is, as I use to say, "a game forever", a great game, challenging, solid, and very difficult to master.

I played this one, and like all Martin Wallace games we've played in our group (all for the first time) we messed up the rules.

In this game, we didn't get income at the end of each turn or phase or whatever it's referred to as in this game.

So money was extremely tight in this game. But I still enjoyed it. I think the way we played it could be used as a variant for some, because it still seemed to work very well and didn't break the game. Just seemed to make your decisions matter so much more.

RATING: 8.5
Great game, but it can be tough to wrap your head around the strategy of what to build. Feels a lot like Power Grid but better. Some players might be turned off by the randomness of the cards compared to other similarly-heavy euros. Like St. Petersburg, another game where having poker chips is a big plus - thin plastic coins are almost as bad as paper money.
After more plays, I think what I like about this game is that I'm not very good at it and want to figure it out. In terms of fun factor, it doesn't rate very high, but I keep it at an 8 because I want to keep playing it, but I see this going down in the future after more plays. 
Update: Still enjoy this one - I like how there is no obvious path and  you're not stuck down one route - you can go heavy cotton in the first stage and switch to coal/iron/tracks in the second stage.

Another Martin Wallace hit for me.  I love the two stage play in this one.  Setting yourself up for the second age is crucial.  The design offers enough routes to victory and each one is challenging.  Formulate your overall strategy and then formulate tactics turn to turn to roll with the punches.  I was taught the game by a reliable player so I have no issues with the rules, though I understand that they are unwieldy.

Very tight game that forces you to plan things out, less you end up gutting your own company. Lots of interaction with other players on the board with plenty of opportunities to wreck their game. Players have to cooperate to a limited extent, but the tension of holding out with that help until the last possible moment is great.

The more I play, the more levels of strategy I see. You begin to understand the importance of turn order, of when to play your iron works (which can be easily overbuilt if they come out too early), the balance of how many loans to take and how aggressively to develop your industries. It's a rich game that can stand up to intense study.

Just a couple, minor quibbles: The core of the game is a tight, economic game, but there are a number of exceptions to the rules on top of it that require a few plays to completely remember. This game is unforgiving, so forgetting some of those exceptions can really ruin the experience at first. This game needs a few plays to fully appreciate, but it is well worth it.

Also, there is a little luck with the card draws. There are times when you are really hoping to draw a certain card and never get it. This a minor quibble though, as this luck can be mitigated with a little forethought. The bigger issue is the uncertainty of what the other players can and cannot do, which adds a little bit of hidden information.

Első nekirugaszkodásra lepattantunk a játékról :(
Borzalmasan érthetetlen volt a szabálykönyv...azóta sikerült szerezni egy jobb, magyarázatokat is tartalmazó variációt, viszont egyelőre a játék még várja az újra próbálást.
---
Másodjára (=első teljes játék) már tisztult a kép. A szabálykönyv minősíthetetlen továbbra is (thaur munkája nélkülözhetetlen!). Rengeteg apró kivétel, finomság, stb. Az érzésem az, hogy két-három parti után fog igazán letisztulni. Egyébként a játékmenet egyáltalán nem bonyolult. Viszont meglepett, hogy a dicsért gazdasági játék (meg, hogy átjön a tematikája) mivolta egyáltalán nem érvényesült. Számomra eddig csalódás. Igaz, hogy full gémer a játék, de szerintem túlságosan agyonbonyolított (akkora a cselekedetek közötti választási lehetőség, hogy teljesen átláthatatlan emiatt). Jobban szeretem a sallangmentesebb játékokat. Azért még kell vele párat játszani, hogy hitelesebben ítélhessem meg.
---
Továbbra sem hozta azt, amit én vártam tőle. A játékszabály borzadalmas, ill. az apró kivételek miatt nem elegáns, nem könnyed a játékmenet.

After some thought, this is a very good game. It's very difficult to learn, but cracking through the rules is very rewarding. I really like how the game forces players to find their place in the overall economy, as opposed to just forming businesses and networks in a vacuum. I do feel like it is a little to constricting, but that's a general problem I have with Martin Wallace games. This one overcomes that issue to stay a good game.

I'm not sure it has as much depth as I originally thought it does - some actions seem to be almost pre-chosen and the game is almost as punishing as Puerto Rico on new players playing veterans, but this is still a game that I'll gladly play.

The two player variant (suggested here on BGG) is brilliant.

RATING: 5
At first I thought that this would be far too 'round', like Power Grid, with ridiculous catch-up mechanisms and ever changing maps to distract one from the very influential plant flipping order, but not so! It has much more depth than I saw at first, & the forced sharing of resources, that kicks it up a level.

We went though phases of group think on this one--massive loans! all about Cotton! Only foreign markets! etc. The game has been robust enough to outlast all of our decisions about its logical end point.

I wouldn't call myself a Martin Wallace fan, but I do kinda like this one and AFAOS, although this one is certainly less contentious than that one, and for me isn't reliant on theme to be exciting--the mechanics are great.

For trade--I like it to play, but not enough to own, I think...copy in VG cond, only played once, Eagle games version with double sided board w/ 2p variant on the back.

A well-done economic game set in industrial-era Lancashire. When I first played it, I found it mind-wracking. On your turn, as you mentally explore your possible actions you will often find that the mechanics prevent you from reaching any of your desired goals. But as you become familiar with the game, you will learn to plan out a decent strategy. This game has amazing balance, as the final scores have always been close every time I've played.

I really enjoyed my first two plays.  A little lighter than age of steam or struggle of empires but seemed like a great game.  Would like to play it a few more times to really get a feel for it.  I also seemed out of sync having to trail blaze rather than follow which was not a winning strategy.  My group seems to have decided the game doesn't have enough replayability as it is to similar every game.

RATING: 9
The theme is an instant winner for me. Maybe an interest in the industrial revolution and North West England helps. Numerous strategies for success, but a player must be flexible depending on what cards they are dealt, and upon what strategies their oponents are pursuing. Really, really like this game. Wallace's best ever?

The two player variant is worthwhle, and even though there are no shortage of games to play for 2, I don't think there is much competition for a serious economic game. 

4 player is clearly where this game is best - the competition is insane, and there is something really delightful about the struggle to find an economic niche. But three player is solid too, altho I think there may be more risk of a player's lead to snowball if allowed to dominate an industry - so don't let em.

If playing this with me, be prepared to get fed up at my shaking my head and saying "I really, really love this game" periodically.

If I'm going to play a long economic game I think this would be my choice more often than not. There's plenty of paths to take and strategies to try out.

Players are English businessmen at the time of the Industrial Revolution, that are out there looking for opportunities and [i]brass[/i].  They make profit out of making canal or rail links between cities, and building industries and putting them into work, specially cotton mills, but also iron works, coal mines, shipyards and ports.  The card system to keep the record of the turns seems to be complicated to follow at the beginning.

RATING: 8
This game has a lot of potential. While not getting the cards you want can be a bit frustrating, I really like how it forces you to find the best option available to you based on what you have. This does a really good job of forcing you to adapt your methods, instead of following the same strategy game in and game out.

The biggest problem with this game so far is that strong plays can be unintuitive. To an inexperienced player, it is difficult to judge the benefits of developing, and how much better higher tech industries are.

I like this game a lot. There's a ton to think about, and multiple paths to victory (though I wonder if ships might not be too powerful...). Anyway, my biggest complaint--and it applies to Age of Steam too--is that I hate when the endgame grinds to a halt, and you're just trying to plop down stuff that's only good for a few VPs. "Nothing else to do, so I guess I'll just put a canal here for 5 VPs." It's not a dealbreaker, though.

I have played this game twice - once  November 06 and May 07. Quite a few changes between each prototype. The second game shows improvements, but there are some tweaks required. 
The balance of the game is about right. 
The decisions to be made are numerous as the cards held don't really put any limit on what you can build once you have a base established. The cards can seem almost irrelevant - all actions that you take just require a card (any card) to be discarded. 
In the first game I played, Iron foundaries were important. You need iron to build higher value Cotton Mills, Coal Mines and Shipyards, but in the entire second game only three were built and there was still iron sitting on one foundary unused at the end of the game. I didn't build one as I didn't see the need. 
However, Coal Mines are important as railway building in the 2nd phase of the game means you need lots of coal.
Mills are certainly useful for upping your income so long as you have a port available to ship it out.
Very nice idea for a game which I am sure will be a hit on release (which it certainly was).

Matches Railroad Tycoon in scope. It's by Martin Wallace, so the rulebook is poor and there's suddenly an odd rule that doesn't work the way you expect it should.

You really have to play Brass once through to learn the rules, then again before you really know what it is you want to be doing. So it's not until your third game that you can play "for real."

A very unique game, the only one I've played where it's completely about timing the spending of your money, and when you take loans. And you manipulate the turn order in order to optimize your investments. The simple but innovative income track makes the whole thing work.

On the flip side, this game has a ton of tiny rules and exceptions, that it's a nightmare to get comfortable with the language and "gotcha" moments are unavoidable (and very fatal/irritating in your first few 3-hour games). It's just too many little quirks for an average person to absorb all in one sitting. The counter-intuitive strategy also means you need 3-4 games before getting the point.

The components are cheap. FRED cheap. My box ripped really easily before a single play, the plastic chips are shitty and useless, and in the case of my copy, were strewn all over the box when I opened it, resulting in the rip, (they even made the spaces big enough for poker chips, c'mon!), the cards are of paper-thin stock, and start bending from the first time you shuffle them. 

I classified this as an economic game, but there is very little actual economic gameplay beyond the basic consideration of supplying when demand is high and taking advantage of newly extraneous supply (plus setting yourself up to be in those situations, which is very non-trivial). This game is just as much about spatial networks and turn order. What I really like is the "race" nature of the game. You're racing to get VPs in a set amount of time (actions) on some gas (income). Loans you take are like pit stops. These are probably the best and most realistic "race" mechanisms I've experienced, thanks to the strategy involved with "pit stops", and they would translate very well to a NASCAR/Formula 1 game.

Authored the definitive Brass strategy guide [thread=494294]here[/thread].

============

My main gripe with the game (and this only comes after attaining expert level): A lot of things, like the Canal Phase wipeout, Level 1s, Birkenhead, in this game are thematically/historically driven. Yet, if Wallace hadn't put in those artificial constraints, the strategic space of this game would be a lot wider, and potentially better. The game is still (very) playable, but it could have been a lot better. For example, the low-tech strategy is completely impractical, and it might have been interesting for the game to put it on even footing with high-develop hi-tech, instead of seeing how the hi-tech players outdo each other. Problem here is nothing tells the new players "don't build level-1" or "don't go into Ports if 1 other already went there unless you can beat him", and that the rules have been rigged to completely shut off your chances at winning if you try building Level 1. You can only think, "gee, I bet Wallace is trying to make a point about obsolescence", and develop them first chance you get. The alternative to this thought is that the low-tech strategy was actually erroneously thought of as viable during playtesting (I'd love to know what were the player scores during playtesting), which notion I've only entertained after A Few Acres of Snow successfully passed through playtesting. It's natural to suspect game balance flaws when a designer is this prolific.

And really, the theme isn't the most stirring one to warrant these weird constraints, either. In fact, I think theme and mechanisms are trade-offs for Wallace. Brass is the "theme" game that tries to teach you a lesson about going for level-1, while Age of Industry is the "balanced" game, with artificial constraints removed. Similar for A Few Acres of Snow vis a vis Mythotopia (though at least Brass isn't broken, since it doesn't have asymmetry, and the players balance the game by going for the overpowered strategy, and it becomes a matter of who can run it better, or if it then makes the underpowered strategy viable enough). 

Also pretty lame how nearly every Martin Wallace design boils down to you get x actions a turn and here's your supersized menu of actions. Go order it up. It's lazy design on par with Worker Placement, if that were the only thing in here. But the aforementioned income track, loans and turn-order manipulation make it worthwhile for plenty of plays.

4+4

RATING: 7.5
Played once with 3P. I can't recall Age of Industry well enough to make a comparison, so this is based of my impressions of Brass on its own. 

At its simplest, the economic system in Brass is about reading the game situation and exploiting demand in the economy. Players may go into the game with some semblance of strategy, but the actions of other players require players to be amenable to readjusting their plans. It may seem sensible to cooperate to get tiles flipped at one point, but in an instant the situation could trigger a race to build certain industries. The element of hand management also plays a role in determining the optimal actions of a player.

The two-part gameplay is interesting, and thoughs players have to try setting themselves up in the first half so that they can hit the ground running in the second half. It does seem that the first half runs a little long, and serves more of an intro for the second half where things get really interesting, but that may be inexperience talking.

There are a few aspects of the game which are less-than-positive to me. Graphics-design wise, it isn't easy to tell which tiles have been flipped at a glance. There are also tiny rules which may be mechanically sound, but they aren't easily remembered nor are they particularly intuitive. (I consider the differences between the handling of iron and coal among the trickier rules.) These may not be a problem for regular players, but as a player who is unlikely to play this frequently, streamlined and intuitive rules really go a long way. 

The biggest downside for me is the potential for downtime in this game. Subtle changes on the board often necessitate a reassessment of plans during a player's turn, and having to reassess 8 different cards during your turn leads to some significant pauses. Granted, this does not happen every round, but it happens frequently enough to make itself noticeable.

While I am not proficient nor am I particularly keen on economic games, Brass offers plenty of engaging decisions and requires a few plays to get a hang of the various strategies involved.  I can't bring myself to brush aside the game's flaws, but there is no denying that the economic system in the game is really solid and remarkable.

[4 plays] Brass is a well themed economic game which has nice crisp turns and some brain burning moments. 

First time out I was in a fog the first third of this game, confused about how things worked and clueless about how to discover a good strategy. Then somewhere along the process everything clicked together nicely for everyone and we were off to the races. I thought my shipbuilding moves would secure me the victory, and in the end, I like the game better for the fact that they did not. There is no killer strategy which immediately breaks the game, you have to play smartly and keep an eye on what everyone else is doing.

Establishing a good income early is important, but unlike Age of Steam, you can apparently take the occasional hefty loan without long term crippling effects. This keeps everyone in the game, even if playing for the first time.

Pretty nice components and decent graphical design, something worth noting from this designer/publisher. Not quite up there with Age of Steam for my favorite Martin Wallace game, but still quite good. (I did not really care for the rather lifeless exercises that are Perikles, Byzantium, and Liberté - while Steam and RR Tycoon are thematic and good.)

Most recent play 1/14/13 online with Michael and Corey.

Additional comments after my second playing:
Loans are not to be feared, everyone should be doing them, just time them well. Links are the key to victory - absolutely crucial in the second half scoring. Wonderful game.

Further comments after 3rd play: Links are not the end all. Corey (with tons of online play under his belt) did some major development digging which allowed him to dominate by building very high point cotton mills.

Kőkemény gazdasági szimuláció. A szabálymagyarázat után nem sok jóra számítottam, de a játék megmutatta miért szerepel előkelő helyen a BGG toplistán. Parti közben rájön az ember, hogy nem is annyira száraz, illetve nem is annyira bonyolult, mint amilyennek a szabály alapján tűnik. Mégis jól játszani igazi kihívás benne. Igazi stratégia és persze taktikai játék is. Nagyon sok jó mechanizmus található a játékban. A bevételek, kölcsönök, az épületek egymásra hatása és persze a kártyák. Amit először úgy éreztem nagyon nagy szerencsét visz a játékba, aztán rájön az ember, hogy itt az egyik mély stratégiai elemmel találkozott. Nagyon jól kell tudni előre gondolkodni és megfelelő kártyákat jó időben felhasználni jó akciókra.
A játékosok Anglia egyik tartományának iparát fejlesztik. Bányákat és acélüzemeket építenek, amelyek nyersanyagokkal látják el a csatornákon, illetve a vasúton összekötött különböző üzemeket. A játék nem vészesen hosszú és 3-an is tökéletes élményt ad, 4-en már jobban konfliktusossá válik.
Én a pamuteladás egyik módjának szerencseszerepét érzem egy ilyen játékban kicsit soknak, illetve a játék kivitelezése lehetne szebb, bár egyértelmű, hogy nem ez volt a cél.
A gazdasági szimuláció kedvelőinek, illetve igazi gémereknek tökéletes választás.

Brass is a strange game.  I didn't like it much at first.  I thought "what was all the hype about on the BGG forums?".  Then I finally got to sit down with some good friends and actually play through a complete game. And I was wowed!  Immediately after playing I wanted to play again because I saw strategy and options unfold before my eyes.

Once the game "clicks" in your head, I'm confident you will love it!  It's pure strategy, except for the hand of cards you draw.  But still, these cards I feel add to the game, not take away from it.

It's already rated pretty high by me, but if I could get more games under my belt to see more of the game's intricacies unfold (which I know are there), I would probably rate it even higher.

Wow, I loved this game.  I didn't expect to; my expectation going in to it was that it would be overly complicated and simulation-y.  But it is neither.  Sure, it's got complication, but all the complication seems to be DOING something; it's not just there for bragging rights.

Frustrating at first, and the rules are not the best, but something about this little economic simulation is extremely compelling.

Dropped 9->8 after many more plays. A great game, but very susceptible to asymmetric luck of the draw. Good cards (and a little experience) mean you can't lose, while bad cards mean you can't win.

The game is amazing and it's not a game to lose its lustre after a few plays, on the contrary, it gets better.

I find this game to be very interesting, once you wrap your head around the idea that within the mechanics are hidden an infrastructure build that supports your economy and a victory earning build. I really wish I could get this to the table more, and that's not coming from someone who is a Martin Wallace drone. The rules aren't quite as bad as everyone makes them out to be, but they could use improvement.

Another admirable design from Wallace that has some neat elements but at the end of the day its just not that fun. All in all, AoS is a better rail game and Tinner's Trail is a better economic game. This mashup is less than the sum of its parts.

The game is complicated to explain (way too complicated), but it does offer several paths to victory. I did find that the cards drawn had a bigger impact on my options than I had hoped they would. I did enjoy it, though. I believe it will be a fun game if you and the group you play with intend to play it several times over a couple of months.

This game is hard!  I found it a little difficult to learn and we kept messing up the rules.  After only 2 plays, it is difficult to say what I think about it because I feel I don't yet understand it.  But I definitely want to play more!!  In our second game, me and another player cooperated in the first age with great results!  I enjoyed that and hope to explore this and other strategies more.

I found the game to be plodding and overly weighty with needless rules.  Some of the rules and exceptions were too complex, and the dealing with the 0-ships was silly.  I didn't find that I enjoyed the experience of playing the game, but would try it again. I also felt there was too much luck from the cards that couldn't be overcome by smart play.

A very cool economic building game. The first game is definitely a learning game.

More forgiving than Age of Steam, but still very fun and wonderfully thematic. The randomness of the cards keeps it from being perfectly calculable, which is good! It speeds up play, and keeps the game more interesting (I'd like some hand management, please!). There are several well-balanced ways to earn VP (which represent future potential for the company; to me, VP represents the sale value of the company at the end of the game: $10/VP).

While I prefer Age of Steam and Struggle of Empires, this should be easier to get to the table. 

Not quite a 10 for me, but pretty close!

Economic building games are right up my alley, but the rules aren't very intuitive, at least to me, and I still don't understand all the restrictions on placement, and other players were also puzzled even at the end of our game.  I'm not sure how big a fan I am of tearing down most of your infrastructure after the canal phase.  You can get some tiles out there that apply to the rail phase early, but practically speaking it doesn't appear you can get too many of those down in time.  I'd like to play again, but my first impression is the design is not simple or streamlined enough to elevate it amongst the ranks of great games.  Update:  after two complete games I'm still fuzzy on some of the rules.  I don't see the logic behind the rules and it makes Brass non-intuitive.  I think the best game designs are usually elegant in their simplicity and this is the antithesis.

I'm one who can find appreciation in both theme and game mechanics. In fact I often lean more in favor of mechanics. I would rather play a dry themeless game with unique mechanics than a boring game with stellar theme. Well, dry and themeless certainly describes this game. I wasn't at all impressed with the mechanics either though. the game is really popular so I was surprised when the game played like just an overcomplicated economic engine builder. 

Each player gets two actions a turn and uses cards to drive their actions which involve building, upgrading, etc. different industry tiles in order to make the most money by end game. It didn't grab me one bit, I've played much more interesting economic and engine building games.

I haven't played the new base game titled Brass Lancashire. The version I have is simply called Brass and the component quality is atrocious. Thin little pieces of cardboard for your industry tiles and colored plastic chips for the money. Yuck!

To my knowledge this is my first Martin Wallace game to date, and boy what a game. As a friend of mine put it: "Martin Wallace is a special taste, either you enjoy it or you think it is dry as the desert in with you want to bury his games". I didn't find this dry at all, quite the opposite. Brass is an economic game of developing your cotton industries in 18th century England, so yes, I can see that some people could experience the game as "dry", but for me it isn't. Instead I get really intrigued in trying to make my industry wheels (Jennys) spin faster than my opponent. I dive in and all a sudden is the game ending and 180 minutes has passed. As I later lay in my bed I cannot sleep because my mind is preoccupied with coal, cotton and iron, not to forget the shipbuilding, and how to develop/produce in the most effective way. And that is not all! My opponent this far seems to have similar feelings about this wonder of a game. There are some drawbacks to the production. The rule book gave us a bit of trouble. The Birkenhead rule was one part we got wrong and even after an effort to correct it some players missed it the second time to and protested wildly that we hadn't talked about it. Well I know we did. Anyhow, the rules aren't that hard at all and  good when you understand them, and with a video review and some player aids, that is corrected.
I think this game will raise to a 10 but I want to play it at least 5 times before I make that kind of commitment. And Martin, yes you Wallace, I will buy some more of your games, because if they are even close to this good then they are worth playing for many years.

Terrific, tense game. Full of interaction (a la Wallace) and with the most incredible mechanics I've ever seen.It could be a bit complicated to play at first sight but when we actually understand the basic concepts and mechanisms it flows very well and gives a full economic experience. Very good.

"JOGO DO ANO 2007" WINNER, By http://SpielPortugal.blogspot.com

Very addictive game, one of the most brilliant games out there. A certain amount of luck driven by the cards that can easily (or not) be out-passed by players skills. That's the challenge: try to win all games even if you don't have the cards playing on your side. It's difficult to master this game but the real opportunity comes every time it is played and in different ways.
Brass plays in about 2 hours and it's one of the most intense and complex games ever made. Walace really pulled his hat off with this one. I can only imagine the hard work on testing this game. A pure Warfrog game that has a good replay ability despite its map being static. A good way to make players happy is to publish another map for this game with one or two rules changes.

I had a hard time ranking this one.  I can see the good maybe even great game here.  I can see the tightness, I can see the need to plan ahead, I can see the engine and the build-up to shipping.  But in my one play I couldn’t handle the randomness of the cards.  It was frustrating planning what I wanted to do and then looking at my cards and not being able to do it.  I am sure it was all to do with hand management and planning but, I am not used to that amount of randomness or restrictions in a game of this type.

I enjoy Brass a lot even though it's not the most elegant game (I like fluid and elegant games). It is immersed in Wallace's very typical exceptions to the rules and feels slightly scripted. It has a few "if's, but's and what's", which occasionally detract from the game's flow and theme.
The game's climax seems to be reached a few turns before the final one.
Initially I hated this, now I've grown accustomed and play it like it is - it's part of the game's personality.
An important deciding factor that takes place in stage 2 of the game and where players usually spend some time, is on building tracks all over the place (if at all possible) just to score some precious additional points - seldom with a specific strategic purpose besides getting those extra points. In this situation the game simply seems to ignore the theme.
Now, in spite of Brass not being a "clean affair", and any additional time spent on development and playtesting might have been put to good use, this game is thoroughly enjoyable.
The more I play it against experienced players, the more tight and fun it seems to become.
It started with a 7 rating and has grown to a 9.
To me this is usually a great indicator. Despite its minor flaws, Brass is a game I highly recommend. Plus, it can be played in 2 hours tops.

Brass is, on the contrary, pure excellence. At least, I read so :-)

50+ plays:  it takes a while, but the more you play, the more you learn to love this game.  Once you learn all of the rules, the meta is shockingly deep, and your strategy has to drastically change based on the other players actions.  There are many ways to play and win, and the decision making can be very tense and meaningful.  Replayability through the roof.  Sometimes the cards can hinder you, but the challenge is trying to pull off a good strategy based on what you were dealt and the other players' actions.

Is it good?  yes, it's brilliant--but you have to like games with relatively brutal efficiency engines, and long-term strategy with some tactical speed requirements as opportunities arise, and therefore your ability to look downstream is particularly important including across a tech-gap mid-game.  The game is relatively long-- realistically expect a 4 hour game to start with (with 4 players) and expect it to not get much faster than about 3, if your players are thoughtful.  I don't mean suffer from AP, but take the appropriate amount of time to analyze the situation so they can play their best.

Lots of odd little details (coal must be connected, iron doesn't; you can pay £5 even if the market is empty; you can ship to distant markets through an unflipped port, etc.) make the game irritating to teach and learn, especially because of the lack of an included player aid or affordances on the board.

But these wrinkles aside, it's a surprisingly simple game that moves quite quickly. Perhaps the biggest downside is that luck of the card draws is perhaps too significant in an economic game of this length. A great game.

This is a terrific game which I first played and rated in June 2008.  I was fascinated with it for a while, especially augmented by the chance to play it on line.  But the release of another game using the same basic system while rubbing away some of the interesting rough edges causes me to drop my rating by a point.  Brass was positioned to become a long-term favorite; now it's a sidelight.

RATING: 6.5
[FRED 2007 edition] {Industry, economic; variable-player-order, action-point, loan, epic; optimal 4p}  Brass is a typical Euro game: agonizing decisions, tight resources management and many calculations.  The good thing, for me, is that it is not a perfect information game, so AP is not a critical problem.  Brass is fun, interactive, strategic and multifaceted.  It simulates the supply and demand principle nicely.  The development aspect of the technologies and cities is a nice mechanic so that players can be more involved.  It is deep and unforgiving, not suitable for new players.  It is a typical Martin Wallace's game - the winner is determined by VP, not by earning power or cash.

Several problems prevent Brass from being classic.  There are far too many fiddly rules and exceptions (I usu. don't like that).  There are thematic incorrect rules; some rules are just counter-intuitive.  And, there are some rules / areas I think are under developed.

The rulebook contains all details but it is not well organized.  The details are scattered in different sections of the rulebook. A better player aid is needed.

The components are sturdy. But the artwork is just so-so, not interesting at all.  The board is quite busy.  A player mat shall be provided.

First,  I like the mechanics of the game.  It was nowhere near as complicated as I thought it would be.  Second, there is some totally needless chrome and exceptions, this games playability would improve if they simply dropped these silly extras. Remind you of another Martin Wallace game?  I don't know what everyone paid for the game but it was a lot considering all I got were 4 counter sheets, a box. and a map, some of those INSANE coins,  and a few cubes.FINALLY, it takes too long to play for what you get.  For example in our last gaming session, we completed three games of Tigris and Euphrat in the same time it took 1 game of Brass, enuff said.

What else can be said, this is a phenomenal game. It's a brain-burner to be sure. We had no problem with the dual score/income track, with 'flying' iron being the only oddity.

In isolation, I like this design better than Age of Industry... but AoI is smoother, faster playing, and has some truly excellent expansions. So AoI is my game of choice.

As it stands, Brass is the quintessential strategy game. Only 1 play so far, not sure of rating yet.

Competitive development in the Industrial Revolution. Described as an 'opportunistic' game when I was taught it, and that word has stuck with me. You're developing your industrial and transportation base, but your industry is only profitable (income, VP) if there is adequate demand for its products, and your transportation network is needed to spread your industries but its ultimate VP value depends on how many profitable industries it connects, irrespective of who owns those industries.

Needlessly complex, clunky, and very rough around the edges. I think the mechanics and basically the whole game could have been improved with more playtesting and effort. Still, it has some interesting factors that make it an average game, but not enough to make me want to come back less than once or twice a year (if that).

Hoping that the new steamlined version with expandability makes it more interesting!

Masterpiece that good for 2-4 players!  Update will fix rule book which was an issue before.  Is a brain burner but great to have a classic for the collection.  Highly interactive as use other players resources.

I don't know the game well enough to play in my regular group, that's partly my fault for not paying enough attention in the previous outing though. Problem is a bad start cripples your chances of being in the mix at the end and therefore I don't pay attention. 

Our group also plays to an exceptional standard so expecting others to slip up is fruitless.

I'm expecting this score to rise when I have my own copy to explore/learn.

Strategically absorbing economic, building and transportation game set during the Industrial Revolution. The object is to develop a number of industries such as cotton milling, coal mining and ship building, and then develop a transport network through first the canal age and then the railway age to transport goods for sale. The main mechanism is card-driven where you play cards depicting either specific industries or towns/cities in the north-west of England, which allow you to carry out those developments and where. There is an enormous amount of thought that goes into each decision you make as you try to ensure optimum use of your own developments/networks, whilst keeping more than an eye on how to exploit what your opponents are doing too. I feel that there is an over-reliance on taking out loans to fund your actions as opposed to gaining income from your industries but overall the result of 'Brass' is an engrossing game which is arguably designer Martin Wallace's finest effort to date.

Played 3+ times. Really just a superb game in my opinion.  I really like how the players define the supply and demand and how you have to manipulate it in your favor and adapt to it as the game goes along.  The building cards and the routes on the map provide just enough decisions and options/frustration to keep that part of the game interesting but not over bearing.  Looking forward to future plays. 2008/10/25

Exceptional game about building networks and industry. Greatly enjoyed the puzzle of how to build your network to encourage your opponents to use use the resources you provide while improving factories. I also really enjoyed the interplay of the various industries like cotton/ports. The soft reset during the second iron age is another great touch which makes you pace yourself in the canal age so that you can get a running start building network rails when the board opens back up.

I didn't enjoy this all that much.  It was okay.  I would like to play it another time or two, just to make sure we didn't miss anything.  But I felt that this one limited me too much with the card play and did not allow me to build my network how I wanted.  (i.e. I felt the card play artificially limited my capabilities, rather than terrain, or cost, etc.)  Why wouldn't I play age of steam instead of this one?

Craig bought this for me for my birthday, and in return I invited him over to my place to play this game with Cynthia. It's a deep economy game, and we were struggling to comprehend our best moves throughout the game. In a way, it was fiddly because of all the extra rules about certain locations/conditions. I keep getting the feeling that my options are limited in this game. Prefer Tinners Trail instead.

12-Dec-2012: Since the last comment, I've replayed this game with a better understanding of how it works. This game has a wonderful economy on the board, and is definitely worth the learning curve. Fiddly it might be in some areas like the virtual port, but it's still a great game.

One of those games you tend to think about even when not playing.  I really like how 'Brass' is played out over two historically distinct phases.  Overall, it makes for an excellent sense of developmental ebb-and-flow, in which market timing becomes a premium concern.  The other major concern, which of course is signature Martin, is all about finagling market access by building up clever networks of canals and later railways.  Tough decisions abound, many relating to cash-flow:  how many loans is going to be too many?--And to what extent am I willing to ally myself to a shared network? Really a wonderfully interactive game.

A fantastic game. Really intense economical game where players have to start from zero income and slowly build up. I feel the money is even more tight than in Age of Steam. 

What I like about Brass is that there's more options than in AoS: in the latter you just build track after track but in Brass you can choose to develop your factories or you can build one of five different kinds of buildings which all cost a different amount of money. 

Sure, there are cards  which dictate where you can build and it is possible to get a bit hosed if you don't have the right card. On positive side, though, there's no rush: if you don't have the card now, you can have it later since opportunities disappear very rarely. And you can always play two cards and only one action in a turn to build anywhere you want.

A bit of an instant classic, this one. Fantastic game. Of course, it helps if you play it right.

Thankfully, we managed to sort it out for a second game, which was enjoyed by all involved.

Just an awesome, dynamic game. Very tactical.  You have to make the best use of your cards, but it doesn't feel like a 'bad' draw is devastating. You need to constantly juggle money spent compared to everyone else to ensure a good spot in the next turn.  You have to build your plan around what everyone else does, and it gets difficult.  

In one game the ports were super rare, and not every cotton mill got flipped.  The very next time we played,  everyone concentrated on building rails, so there was a ton of coal, and there were 2 ports that didn't get flipped.  The game dynamic follows the actions of the players, rather than the player dynamic followed the game.  

This game is all aces.

RATING: 7.5
Brass is a great mind-melter of a game, but I'm going to dwell on a few things about it that bugged me.  

First, there's a completely unnecessary layer of rules complexity.  It makes the game harder to learn/teach and really doesn't add anything to the game of value.  I'd prefer it if it was more abstracted rather than trying to simulate the historical differences between shipping iron and coal, for example.  And that fucking channel...

Second, adding up scoring is REALLY finicky.  I think it'd be easy to mess that up.  

Third, the last few turns feel more like cleanup as players scrounge for points with severely limited options.  The game feels like it's already wrapped up but we're still there playing.  Maybe the game would have a better crescendo if it ended a turn or two sooner when players are still deciding between actual options?

Fourth, those slippery plastic coin tokens suck.  I think all four of us dropped at least one on the floor.  

But now I'm nitpicking.  I really did like it and hope to play again.  (But I won't buy it because I don't want to be the one teaching it.  Maybe Age of Industry...)

Can't get it to the table, so I'm dabbling with online play...

3/24/12 - Wow. Just wow. I'm very impressed. I wrote this mini-review in my GCL. So I decided to just copy-and-paste it here. Enjoy!

--

So what did I enjoy about Brass? Here's my best effort to sum it all up:

1. Tension. This game has tension in spades. The best way to illustrate this is by examining one of my favorite design elements to the game: turn order. In Brass, a player takes two actions on every turn. Turn order changes every round based on the amount of money spent by each player at the end of each turn. The player who spends the least, gets turn-order priority in the next turn. So by spending less this turn, I can potentially go first next turn. This makes for some very interesting and powerful decision making. In most actions, you'll be spending at least a few pounds to complete the action. But there is one action that doesn't cost anything, and that's getting more money (taking a loan). So you can see what kind of great decisions develop: I want to build my cotton mill, and would like to sell to the distant market before Billy. But the cost of the cotton mill will put me after him in turn order next turn, so he could sell before me. Okay then, I'll just build this link for 3pounds then take a loan. Then next turn I'll have cash on hand, get to go first, build my cotton mill, then sell before Billy can even react. Brilliant! Now, which cards do I use?...

Very exciting stuff. Tension abounding.

2. Unique economics. I don't have a "true" economic game in my collection. I don't consider Brass to be one. It's no 18xx title, that's for sure. There's no real speculation and/or market trade. And its market is fairly abstracted with several rule exceptions for me to consider it "true". But what it does well is create an atmosphere where players aggressively compete in a tight space for the best financial positioning. There are a few markets to consider: iron, coal, and cotton sales in distant lands. The distant market for cotton is simply a race mechanic. The first couple players to sell to the distant market make the most money and have the least risk that their sales will be rejected (while demand is high). The other two are only present when players on the board aren't offering iron or coal from their industries. The variety of industries is nice, but they're all very simple--which I like.

Loans are an important part to success in this game. I can't imagine a player ever getting the money he needs to win without taking out at least a couple of loans. But the loans are also very forgiving. In most situations, you can see within one or two turns how you will pay back your debt, and usually surpass the debt you incurred for the loan with optimal play. It's also entirely possible for no players to ever pay anything to the bank since players start with enough money to build up the required industries to generate income each turn.

There are no stocks in Brass.

In short, the economic system here is very interesting, but it's not going to give a lot of satisfaction to advanced economic gamers. That isn't to say it doesn't have its place. It definitely does, but if you're looking for a deep, detailed economic simulation, you won't find it here. If you want a more stream-lined, tactical-based economic system (less focus on buy/sell), then this may be your game.

That said, it's perfect for me and my gaming level. Some day I'll be ready for more. (I'm currently considering Poseidon or 1830 for more.) for now, I'm loving what Brass offers for an economic gaming platform.

3. Engine building without the upkeep. Great engine-building designs often get fiddly. Mr. Wallace has created a low-maintenance engine-building system with the industry tiles in Brass. You build an industry and basically there is a required amount of goods each industry needs to generate/fulfill to pay it off. After that, you simply get money each turn (and some VPs at the end of the period). Simple and elegant. It doesn't even seem like you're building an engine, but you are. Industry tiles that seem crazy-expensive at the first of the game are more affordable at the end of the game. Flipping tiles (meeting its fulfillment requirements) at end-game becomes easier than it was at the first. Before another player mentioned its engine-building element, I hadn't even thought of it that way. That's how elegant it is.

There's something incredibly satisfying about flipping over several industry tiles in one turn, moving your income marker up the track, and seeing more VPs in your color on the board. It's also fun to see how everybody's networks grow to eventually devour a board that initially seems unnecessarily oversized! It's an incredible implementation of several relatively-complex ideas that all come together smoothly. And it is fun to make it all happen together.

4. Coopetition. This is not a typo. When I first read it on another review, I knew exactly what the reviewer was saying. If I hadn't played Brass, I probably wouldn't have known, and would have thought it was a typo. Brass introduces coopetition. Paul Springer talks in his UFBRT video review about how every part works together in a system of inter-connectivity, and without every part, it wouldn't work--including the players! Players who build an industry are dependent on other players to build other industries requiring their produced resources, while that second player is dependent on the first player just to build that industry that he needs. Did I just blow your mind? Good, because that's what this game has done to me so far. It has blown my mind.

--

I can't believe I let Brass sit on my shelf for so long without playing it. Now that I've got two full plays under my belt, and two more close to finishing. I feel ready to take it to the members of my family that will appreciate it--my mathy-gamer sister is going to LOVE it.

After two full plays (and two in progress online), I'm giving it a 9.5, it's immediately going into my Top 10, and I assume it will be in my Hot 10 for some time to come. I'm happy to say that what is probably a respected classic for most of you is my current HOTNESS!

This is such an impressive game.  I think the inter-relationship between victory points, income, and resources is the most elegant and impressive of any game I've ever seen.  Pretty heavy and dry industrial game, so you won't love it if you prefer theme-heavy dice-chucking games.  But I LOVE this type of game, so I rate it very highly.

I really like this type of economic, network building game.  Brass hits the sweet spot in having to plan out your financial strategy without being overly complex.  The drive for the best industries can be aggressive, but there are plenty of other ways to achieve victory.

I find myself obsessing over my play of this game a full 24 hours after it took place. The mechanics of interdependent development are simply awesome. I still have not wrapped my mind around what sort of approach one should take in this game, and I love that reaction. The interactions are quite complex whith so many choices that the game changes direction constantly as other players make unpredictable choices. A good player must adapt. This is precisely the sort of game I love. The theme is also very well integrated into gameplay so that it has a distinctive steampunk feel throughout. I am impatient to have another go.

Gotta this to the table more, I like it a lot when I'm playing it but then I forget some of the slightly clunky rules and it bogs down the next play a bit.

I hate having to dig in a rule book during the game and there are just enough rough edges in Brass' rule set to make it a mild annoyance.

In someways it feels like a deeper but clunkier version of Railways of the World.

I didn't know much about Brass going into my first play, but I'd heard it mentioned so often as an underappreciated gem that I had high hopes.

First Impression:

A fine interactive euro where you develop your infrastracture while trying to make the best out of your opponents' moves. On the good side of interaction imo, and low in luck. It's also somewhat thematic, and although you're not exactly growing an empire, you do get some satisfaction when you finally complete your plans.

On the downside, there are several annoying small rules to remember (typical Wallace), and the hand management part adds some unecessary luck to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice combination of network and economic gaming.  Plays better with four than with three because of the added dimension of positional scarcity.  Just enough of a luck element to force a player to try different strategies.  Rules are complex (best to have someone experienced teach the game to you), but interact relatively intuitively.  Very intellectually satisfying for a game relatively short.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Good but not great.  As much a logistics exercise as an economic game, but I like both aspects.  The limitations of the cards are a bit annoying for a game of this type.  While I enjoyed it, I wasn't captivated.  Maybe more plays will change this impression.

I made sure to give this a second try after not being particularly enamored after my first play, and the second play only served to confirm my feeling that this may just not be for me.  Most people seem to love this one, and I was certainly eagerly anticipating Wallace finally making another non-fighting game, since he'd been doing things like Byzantium and Perikles lately.  However, I think I'd always rather play Age of Steam over Brass because AoS is just a more fulfilling route-building game.  Admittedly Brass is very different, and has some interesting elements going for it, such as the clever way the resource market and movement works and the upgrading of buildings (like a technology tree).  I don't mind the board wiping clean in Amun-Re, but the way the Old and New Kingdoms work in Brass just doesn't sit right with me as it seems a bit too forced.  I also know I shouldn't judge the game's balance after only two players when I'm sure it was playtested countless times, but I can't see the shipyards not being the dominant strategy, so the idea of having plenty of choices seems misleading since getting your four shipyards seems like it ought to be your focus, it's certainly been the winning strategy in both games I played.  I'd be willing to give Brass a third try, but won't be begging to play it again.

RATING: 10
Upgraded to a 10 after about 10 plays. Excellent, excellent game. Definitely my favorite of Essen 2007, even over the very good Agricola. The balance is superb, it feels thematic (to someone who knows only a smattering of the relevant history, anyway), there's plenty of interaction but it's indirect denial and making things difficult rather than in-your-face aggression, and skillful play is well-rewarded with victory points.

The randomness in the cards really hits a sweet point for me -- it constrains you just enough that you can't ignore what you have in your hand, but never so much that you feel like the cards are playing you instead, or that the luck of the draw was a big factor in the game result. Big kudos on a really ingenious mechanism there.

My only complaint is that there are enough exceptions and one-off rules and things that work this this one way and that the other that the game is hard to teach to new players. Three examples: To get coal somewhere, you need (anyone's) link; for iron, you don't. To play an industry card, you need your own link, plus resources; for location cards, you don't, but you still need resources. You can upgrade your own buildings, except that you can upgrade someone elses coal or iron when the supply is completely exhausted. Anyway, these problems go away when played with people who have played before, and they make sense when you think about them from a game-design perspective, but they do make the teaching of the game a bit exhausting and full of 'oh yeah, I forgot to mention...' moments.

RATING: 8
[thing=28720][/thing] is a heavy economic game in which you build ports, coal mines, iron works, shipyards and cotton mills in order to gain income and points. The game has two phases: the canal phase and the railroad phase. In the end of each phase the buildings fully used are scored, and also the connections. Buildings of level 1 can only be built in the canal phase, and they leave the board when the phase 2 start.

All the constructions, when fully used, give two things: income and points. The income you take immediately. Some buildings give more of one type and less of the other. And the level of them (that goes from 1 to 4, except the shipyards, that goes from 0 to 2) change a little the amounts given. For exemple, a level 2 coal mine gives 7 of income and 2 points; a level 4 gives 5 income and 4 points.

[thing=28720][/thing] uses a smart hand management to work: there are two types of cards - the City cards and the Building cards. You use the City cards to build in the named city, even if you don't have a connection that leads there. The Building card you use to build the type of construction on it anywhere that you have a connection. Some buildings require the connection to a port or to a coal mine or a iron works, because it uses coal or iron.

On a player turn you have two actions and they are:
- building an industry;
- building a connection (either canals or rails based on phase of the game);
- develop their own industries which removes lower level industries from the player's stack in favor of higher level;
- sell cotton;
- take a loan.

The game goes for two phases, and the phases end when all the cards of everyone have been used.

[thing=28720][/thing] provides a lot of player interaction (you can, and probably will, use other players ports, coal mines, iron works and connections). The market/demand for coal, cotton and iron is simple and they work really well. Pretty straightforward. The game has a lot of tension, since the spaces start to be taken by constructions, and your options gets tighter every round, so you must consider a lot which cards to use, because some of them maybe key in order to give you some wiggle room in late rounds.

Timming is also a strong aspect of the game: when to build, is as important as to where and which. It is paramount to see the opportunities given by the demand of resources, the open spaces, and the moment to spend and when to save money in order to be one of the first to act next round (the player order goes from the player that spend the least to the one that spend the most). Every action seems connected to the next.

I really liked that the loan in [thing=28720][/thing] isn't something that will totally break your legs - a loan affects your income, but not by much. It is just another part of the game, and you will probably have to take a few of them - and, as everything else, when to take a loan is important (and usually is better to take the maximum of 30 pounds), not only, but also because when the stack of cards is depleted you won't be able to take a loan.

So [thing=28720][/thing] is a great game, one that you will have to use your thinking cap more than once.

I really enjoy the back and forth play of this one. Even though, it's economic game , you feel like you're trying to flank your opponents and cut them off without getting squeezed out yourself. The first game, though, it's very hard to figure out how to position yourself for the transition to the rail age, so I'll need a few more plays before rating it.

On one hand it has a library of specific maneuvers & city/route values, on the other the turn order shenanigans & the cards bring an unscriptable tactical scramble. One learns the former, but the latter takes some sort of desperate wit.

A beautiful mix of strategy & tactics. The game appears symmetric at set-up, but players drive it into early asymmetry with the development mechanic acting as a springboard. A wonder of interdependencies & rapier moves. 

Brilliant.

Martin Wallace proves that he is once again the king of board game designers by designing a game that makes sense thematically and has a tight yet fair economic system. It's not a game that I'll bring out on every occasion -it's only for the core gamers, the ones who are looking for a deep, engaging game. It's not too long of a game -- play seems to take 90 minutes to two hours - but it's an intense experience of deep thought and tough decisions. Wallace fans will likely be happy with the game, but beginners should beware and perhaps look at something easier before attempting Brass.  See my review for more details...

In 2010 I've played it twice and found it an OK game, but I haven't thought about Brass, nor missed it until the Kickstarter campaign ran toward its end. The added extras annoyed me, with its luxury poker shit items and all kinds of exclusive crap.  Really bad, typical Kickstarter politics: produce an incomplete game and wait til enough backers before completing components. And then add unnecessary crap and call it exclusive. 
The upcoming Roxley version looks much, much better though than the original releases. We’ll see whether Brass’ design can hold up today. I think that the original design compared to current releases will feel very old fashioned.

My current opinion is based on one game only. I think this is quite complicated as there are many kinds of stuff, and everything works a bit differently.

Wow. Definitely filing this under the "nothing else quite like it" category. The only thing that keeps me from rating this higher is the fairly steep learning curve, not so much due to the rules, but more so for the difficulty that beginners have in "seeing the whole picture." However, if you and your game group are willing to put in the time for multiple plays, this will prove a very rewarding game. It also doubles as a geography lesson for Lancashire!

It is an outright crime that it took me this long to get this one played. This is a classic. The mechanics are superb and opaque enough so that the best way to play is not immediately obvious. Very heavy on the player interaction side with the racing element of getting your tiles out, which also means that you might not have all the time in the world to prepare for a super-combo. This is probably the best Martin Wallace game I have played, even better than Steam and Automobile. This might even be among the best games ever made but I need a few more plays before getting certainty. And no matter what I would still have problems getting this to the table if I owned it because it sounds and looks a bit intimidating to a new player.

Comes together in a way that most other economic games don't for me.  I think it helps that this one features a spatial aspect that is missing from other economic games.  Theme shines through well, with a few glaring exceptions.  The cards have no real-world rationale that I can see, and the really abrupt switch from canals to rails is a little hard to swallow.  Otherwise, the supply, demand, and surplus issues that come up around the region are quite evocative.  Good theme, neat gameplay.  Wallace continues to establish himself as one of my favorite designers.

Lots of meat on these bones. We do like to play some heavier games every once in a while, and this is an excellent one. The cards provide some randomness, but there's enough mechanisms here to deal with it that those who don't like luck should be able to like it.

The cube mechanism where you might end up removing some cubes from your opponent's tile when you build something works really well. Lots of nice "damn, do I build this, it's just going to help them down the road" moments.

The usual "unpolished" rules do not help.
Overall, an economic game lacking something alluring enough to make you desire to play it again soon.

Un juego casi perfecto con múltiples caminos hacia la victoria. Lo mejor del juego son las cartas, sin ellas no sería lo mismo, es más, creo que es lo que le falta a algún otro juego de Wallace. Lo peor las reglas, muy mal redactadas y estructuradas, y en algún caso, poco elegantes o intuitivas.

Fantastic game where you really need to be planning at least two or three turns ahead as player order is determined by the amount of money spent in the last round. Tight enjoyable experience all round with many routes to victory.

1 play so far. One of the most AP prone and brain burning games I've played. So many variables on the board, 8 cards with about 4 possible actions each to consider each turn, and variable turn order means you have to think about what to do A LOT. I was engaged just about the whole game though, so downtime felt TOO short at times. The person before you can screw up your plans forcing you to sit there thinking while everyone is waiting for you. 

I greatly enjoyed how the first half of the game and 2nd half were very different, but it wasn't something I was really expecting or could understand until we got to that point in my first game. The Coal demand went through the roof! I really liked the supply/demand dynamic between players and this brought a feeling to the game that was unique for me. 

I lost horribly but a large part of that was me making a critical misjudgement in the last quarter or so of the game and if I hadn't done so I would have been 3rd or 2nd instead of last. Still an interesting game!

In typical Wallace fashion the rules are fiddly and overwrought, but once you absorb them there is an interesting game here of playing the hand you're dealt while reacting to changing dynamics of supply and demand on the board. For the number of moving parts it isn't really that deep and on some level the hand management seems incongruous with the rest of the game, but for all the philosophical problems I have with it Brass is just a fun game to play.

Never thought I'd fall for an economic game! Sat at the table by chance and that was love in the first sight. Strangely enough, the game is hard to pick up but it's only half of the play that you realise how simple it is, how logical, how easy-going. come on, how could this guy explain the rules for an hour?! the game is great because it doesn't tell you what you do in its course. it just says how it works and everything you do you do your own way. excellent!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
There's an interesting economic engine in this game that drives a VP engine, but it's going to take a game to at least understand how it works.  There are a lot of rules to remember here, and they don't work quite as intuitively as, say, Age of Steam, but I think the game would grow to be more intuitive the more people played it.  Knowing how everything interacts is critical to winning the game, and it's not something that will become apparent with the first play (or even the third or fourth, for that matter).

It took me years to get Brass to the table. I had heard it was a nightmare of exception based rules and mechanics that worked one way in one phase and then differently in another. I glanced at the rulebook and that certainly seemed to be the case. Eventually, I made myself sit down, focus up and read up on it.

As I took it in, slowly and deliberately, I realized that the game is rather simple. Play a card, do a thing in that area. The possible actions numbered only five and even those were fairly rules light. I went through the "exceptions" that I had heard so much about and suddenly I realized that once you knew how the game worked, those exceptions were sort of obvious. It was just clumsy writing to explain certain spots on the map that would seem confusing had you never played before.

"This will be a piece of cake", I thought. Then I sat down to explain it. Suddenly, it felt like the exceptions had tripled. The easy feeling action menu suddenly had much more depth than I was able to explain. I found myself saying "Oh, and one more thing..." every five minutes. The criticisms are true, this game is a mess of caveats.

Still, as clumsy as that first game felt, once you get going it is one of the smoothest games you'll ever play. Caveats aside, the actions are simple and brief. The game flies along once everyone knows what they are doing. The strategies are quite deep as well, do you build a verticle organization that hoards all the points for yourself at great expense or do you try and piggyback on what others are doing, simply providing them the tools to score points, so you can too?

The scoring system reminds me quite a bit of Wallace's legendary train games, as more points equal more money, but ultimately the money is worthless. It only matters how much you have built and how efficiently you did it. I have barely scratched the surface of this one, but I have a strong feeling it is going to be one of my favorites for a long, long, time.

Interesting building game,  "flip" to activate buildings to establish "trade routes".

Sin embargo peca de reglas complejas y muchas excepciones a tener en cuenta. Parece más sencillo si lo explica alguien que entienda las reglas y haya jugado antes. Ofrece sin embargo variedad de estratégias y caminos a la victoria, lo que le permite "cierta" rejugabilidad a pesar de su "densidad" inicial. Con fundas tamaño eurogame 59X91mm (sobra un pelín a lo alto, pero quedan genial).

Really good game.  Someone in the forums compared it with Power Grid, and I agree.  Brass does seem to fit a similar spot in the game spectrum as Power Grid.  While I generally love most of Martin Wallace's games, many of them are a little too deep to get regular play.  This one will probably get pulled out often, as it has the depth of Wallace's great games, but a level of play a notch below his other more difficult games.  The rules are somewhat difficult to read - I'm a pretty proficient rules reader and it took me two times through the rules plus some readings of BGG articles to really understand it.  I'd recommend having someone teach you this one.

Even if I won the only time I played it, I don't like it. It is pretty complex, almost impossible to understand what to do at the beginning. Selling good at foreign market is rather akward while the ships are way too valuable compared with other buildings.
All in all, it is a bit too clumsy.
Nice map and settings, the coins are rather strange to handle; the mechanics of discarding a card to "burn" old useless building is original but it doesn't convince me very much.
Probably I'll like it more next time i'll play it.

I want to rate it as a three because I did not understand this game, at all. I did not enjoy it, therefore. But I think that I would like it more once I get the hang of it so I would be willing to play a few more times and see. I feel as though it is actually a really good game and one that I may enjoy a lot if I knew the rules better, remembered little details better, had the hang of the strategy, and just generally played it a few more times/was more familiar with it. I had a really bad first experience but not for anything inherently wrong with the game...

Economic sim. We are budding industrialists seeking fortune by exporting cotton from our mills.  Paths to profit are diverse by investing in coal mining, iron plants, ship ports, and laying networks of canal in the early phase or rail at the end. Cards are used for development and for tile placing. Pretty smooth, meaty strategy decisions with limited resources and development locations.  Late game rounds mushroom into big scoring plays. Long.

purchased April Fools '08. Have played two games in quick succession May 08, both 4 player. An intriguing game where  you certainly need to maintain a flexibility with your hand as other players interfere with your plans. This ability to change plans and maneuver reduce significantly as your hand depletes later in each era. Also turn order plays a *huge* part enabling you to set up and then smash your *serve* before other players beat you to the quick. Then there's the wide range of strategies that are open in the game, it sometimes can be a little mind boggling, which I think is the games best and yet biggest flaw. Players are left gaping with possibilities, and often will end up paralysing over it. Admittedly though the second game felt easier as far as playing the mechanics, but we still took 4 hrs to play the game! Still, this is another Wallace game I'm rather smitten like a kitten with. It's right up there with Aos and struggle. Look forward to more games...
Update: Long time since I've played this puppy. One thing that tripped me was what defined your 'Network' and where you can play cards to to build, and also how you acquire coal to build. I'd recommend rereading these subtleties if you haven't played for a while and need a refresher.

I've played numerous times, now (thankfully) by the correct rules.  Great game!  Ship-building is definitely not a game-breaking strategy.

Players are confronted with multiple decisions each turn (build rails? build an industry? ship cotton? take a loan? research?) - all of them interesting.

Brass is as good as Perikles, which I rank as one of Wallace's better recent efforts.

I prefer Age of Industry to Brass, due to the lower fiddly factor, support for an extra player, multiple board expansions, and various rules revisions.  Brass is now on the trade pile.

Played twice (with 3 and 4 players). The rules are a bit confusing (we made at least one minor mistake in each game). Lots of interesting ideas in this game, which work rather well overall - but some of them really add a lot of rules for a very little game effect, and I suspect the game would have gained a lot (at least for me) if some of these small rules had been streamlined a bit. However, my major gripe is the randomness of the card draw, especially since you have no visibility of the cards you will get at the beginning of the rail period, and thus cannot start preparing your strategy in that direction at the end of the canal period. Of course, experience probably helps with that (but even then, I am worried that getting a "good" draw will still be a large advantage). I will definitely try and play it again, but I fear that the cards will prevent me from really liking this game.

Amazing game. Despite all the little rules it manages to grab you and hold you all the way to the end and those rules do allow to recreate the "spirit" of the era.

1st play:  I'd play it again.  We played with 3 newbies and one guy who had played 6-7 times.  I've heard that learning the game from the rule book is difficult, but we had no trouble picking the game up from the one experienced player.  There's some opportunity to plan ahead and bet on what other players will do, but there are also chances to take advantage of situations as they arise.

+: solid strategy game
+: unique
+: predict the choices of other players
-: poses a steep learning curve to non-gamers
-: you can be "out of the game" if you played poorly (or got unlucky)
-: chances of winning also depend your randomness (your hands of cards)
-: not with 5+
-: when others have AP :-(

I really like this game for some reason.  I think it's the theme, and feel when I'm playing it.  It just seems very interesting!

Well, sometimes it’s just a 9.5. The lack of valid strategies and a bad card draw frustrate me quite a bit from time to time. But I know that in the next game I might see a really clever play and maybe even something I haven’t seen before and it’s at 10 again. I still enjoy it, even after playing over 1,000 games. So I guess it really is a 10.

Building networks of businesses at the start of the industrial revolution.  That first game is quite a brain burner as you're trying to figure out the point of what you're doing and cursing your cards for not being more helpful... but once you get your head around what the tile flipping is all about there is a really great game here... maybe even better than Steam as there are more varied ways to make money... but as it's less versatile than "that train game" I'm not thinking its one I need to own.

Brass is one of those games that will give experienced players an obvious advantage over others.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it does lend itself to a couple of "I didn't know you can do that" kind of moments.  I don't envy the people that had to teach themselves how to play, I was fortunate enough to have someone explain the rules to us (complete with a homemade player aide).  I'm not too sure if Brass is really a game with depth or just has the appearance of one, more exposure will definitely help, but for now I am leaning towards the positive.

very good and balanced game. There are a lot of possibilities to make victory points, but the cards and the timing are determinant.

Ooh, [person=6]Martin Wallace[/person], you clever fellow, you!  I love the mind-bending plotting and scheming in this game.  The exceptions can be frustrating to explain effectively, but are the loopholes-by-design that enhance the aforementioned scheming.

Steep learning curve. Ability to keep many small details in player's mind required. In Brass you build networks and the smallish playing area quickly evolves into a complex system. For a newbie, it's next to impossible to see who's actually winning, until you tally the final score. Amazingly underwhelming art and visuals. Rewards patience, but all the abstraction distances the game from its thematic, real world elements. However, experience reveals a deep and very satisfying gaming experience.

This one takes forever, you could go and watch an episode of your favourite tv-series between turns.

After 1 Play: I doubt I'll ever play it again.  This reminds me more of a wargame than a euro in its rule structure.  Instead of the logical synthesis of a euro, the rules seem to be thrown together without regard to their interrelation.  I may have been able to get over that hurdle in the long run, but I'll never play it enough to accomplish that because  I just don't find the economic backbone of the game very fun to play.

This game really is a blast: definitely in the league of Age of Steam. It is not that unforgiving but mostly because the player interaction can help you out when you made a mistake. Very good mix of cooperative and competitive play.
At first the board seems static but every game plays different enough from each other. Fast turns ensure a low downtime while every decision you make will still highly influence your position on the board and the outcome of the game.
This game offers really a lot: technical development, transportation and logistics optimization, cooperative work, a market simulation, risk management... Martin Wallace has proven to be a high calibre game designer that puts out hit after hit!

RATING: 10
As of yet Brass is the best game I have ever played. It took me 2 or 3 games before I fully understood what was going on and even now after 12 or so plays I feel like I still have a lot to learn about the game. I would play this game so much more if only I could find people to play it with... Still it stands as my favorite game of all time and I truly savor every chance I get to play. Mr. Wallace you are a master.

经济类游戏中的最佳作品，背景选材，和游戏体验结合的非常到位;设计师马丁最硬派的作品之一。游戏中玩家需要打出卡牌，在（建设，升级，贷款，网络，出售）中选择需要执行的行动，游戏获胜的方式非常多，几乎没有最优的路线。此外BRASS在本人眼中也相当于一块试金石，一局下来可以用来区分鉴定中度到重度玩家这两个领域。

"Never sell or trade games shelf"  - Great game. I have owned and played many many games over the years and only have a select few that are in my "never sell or trade games shelf" and this is one of them. I am about a 90% 2 player gamer most of the time though and Brass is much better with 3.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game.
But, the game is twisted and difficult especially for the first play.  I think this is typical trend for recent Euro game and this one is a bad example.
Maybe some people do like this game because of this fact that winning process is hard to be found ant if you can accept this fact as replayability in positive way, maybe you'll like this game.
But, for me, it is very rare to play the same game again, I could not enjoy this game's play. I think this game needs more and more play for enjoying.

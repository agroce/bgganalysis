Like just about every other game I have played by Flying Frog (Touch of Evil, Fortune and Glory, Last Night on Earth), it is a good game, but not a great game.  The components are top notch and everything is in place, but there is something that causes it to miss the mark.
I'd happily play their games -- they are enjoyable, but there is always a sense of a little letdown.  I don't understand why [thing=99130][/thing] does the zombiepocalyse so much better.
With that said, I did enjoy this one more than the regular game.

RATING: 8
A great, very thematic zombie game from Flying Frog, the undisputed masters of Ameritrash. This game improves a fair bit over Last Night on Earth, particularly in the radio station scenario, and is overall a great standalone game. I haven't played with the two combined.

It sometimes drags, or can be too lop-sided, but that's often due to the players rather than the game.

RATING: 8
I usually lump expansions into the base game stats, but I'm keeping this "standalone expansion" separate from the original base game since I am planning to keep the components separate for now. The rating is slightly lower than the original due to lesser content.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Adds some interesting mechanics to the classic Last Night on Earth, and everything has an awesome, thematic element to it (as always with Flying Frog). Still, this doesn't feel quite as strong as some of the other LNOE expansions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
What I said about the base-game but now with a cool EXP-System that lets you believe you'd have even better chances to survive - but makes you realize that even the zombies evolve likewise.

After playing the base-game a couple of times, this just adds the right amount of flavour to spice up the game a notch. *BAM*

- Additional note: the upgrades for the survivor are much cooler (sometimes) than those of the zombies (at - well - anytime?). But frankly the survivor deserve them, if they can get them.

This is a terrific "base game expansion" for an already excellent franchise. It probably would me my recommended purchase for gamers who don't own any LNoE game. What it narrows in theme it more than makes up for by bringing in the best of the game elements culled from the expansions already released, streamlining the rules, and adding game elements (upgrades, fire) which absolutely improve the narrative pace of the game. Last Night on Earth is a wee bit too random to be rated a 10 for me but I have no qualms about declaring it the best beer and pretzels game on the market.

A big improvement over the original. The new quests seem to play a bit quicker than the original and I really like the hero upgrades. Noe, if you lose your awesome weapons, you still have access to your upgrade abilities, so it doesn't feel like starting completely over mid-way through the game. Also, I really liked the addition of fire in the game. It adds an interesting and chaotic element to the game. I do wish the zombie upgrades were a bit more interesting or varied. The heroes get a lot of cool abilities. The zombies mostly get one-shot cards.

Good zombie themed game.  Can be played as either the heroes or as the zombie player.  I always seem to end up as the zombie player in my group but can't complain since the zombies are really fun.

RATING: 9
As a stand-alone game, Timber Peak is merely "okay," but as an expansion pack, Timber Peak is awesome!  The additional rules make it feel as if you've just started playing LNoE 2.0.  Before this expansion, I was starting to think that the zombies were a bit overpowered.  Suddenly, with the additional rules for experience, the battlefield seems to have leveled out.

The additional board segments also boast some of the more intriguing "Pick Up" abilities, granting more than just a simple "grab a card from the discard pile" mechanic.

This one is a definite must have!

After most recent play I took this game down to 7 from 8; the dice rolls early were so one-sided -- just a few key ones at start of game -- that it set the whole session off on a course whereby Zombie player was pretty obviously going to win (and did). Of course, I love games with dice and probabilities. But the overall design of this game had me slightly less enamored. Still very likable game, of course.

Played this with 5 players.  We each had a character each playing against one zombie player.  I didn't really enjoy it that much.  I think Last Night on Earth games are best with 4 with 2 on each side and the survivors playing 2 characters each.  One issue with LNOE is the Zombie player is overly powerful with his deck on Zombie Cards and playing with just one character I just think it drags too much.  I would love to play again with 4.  Didn't play my copy.

RATING: N/A
Another zombie goodies! This standalone expansion adds the fire mechanic (found in Invasion from outer space) and experience system (like found in DnD games; therefore you gain experience tokens by killing zombies, or heroes; for zombie players). Good thing that the experience card can be boosted (by paying more experience tokens) for greater effect. 

I plan not to mix this game with any of my LNOE series as I think it plays just right, out of the box. Plus, mixing all will just lengthen the game.

The game also take the "always zombie heroes" and  "heroes replenish" optional/variant from the base game, permanently integrated into the game now.

Timber Peak works extremely well as a standalone game, but also holds the distinction of being the best expansion for Last Night on Earth to have come out so far. 

The fire rules from Invasion From Outer Space are here, but gone is the fiddly and uninteresting "star system". Instead, we are treated to a new experience system that is extremely easy to implement and should be a part of every LNoE game in the future. The experience system is easy to understand (deal a wound, gain an XP) yet provides extremely difficult and interesting choices about how to spend this experience. As is to be expected, these choices are more interesting from the hero side. Nevertheless, the zombies have an easier time gaining experience, and can buy cards cheaper with it. 

The heroes work very well within this system, and many could easily cross over into LNoE as well, though the duplication of certain characters is a bit disappointing. The new boards have some really great buildings. I love the power station especially which has an excellent thematic flavor and interesting mechanics.

All in all, this strikes me as a very mature effort from Flying Frog. They have taken the lessons they have learned about what worked and what didn't from the other games in the LNoE system and managed to make a game that is almost a re-launch 2.0 version, but still works great as an add on for the existing materials.

Excellent addition to the Last Night on Earth series. Love this game for its theme, art, easy play, and infinite capacity for customised gameplay. Only one play so far: Custom scenario based on Radio Station. Zombies won by killing 3 heroes. Zombies started with 8, and were fortunate to get an extra 6 on the board immediately. Later took over the Power Relay Station, enabling them to overwhelm Michael (who had found the repair parts) for the third hero kill. Meanwhile, Nikki had returned the tools to the sound booth. Heroes were unlucky; had to uncover 7 of the 8 counters to find the tools and the parts. Yes, luck plays a role in this game, and if that doesn't appeal to you, move on. But you need a bit of luck to survive the apocalypse, right?

Still not sure if this is an improvement over original LNoE. The fire rules add some extra chaos, and I miss the variety of more characters.

UPDATE: I think this is both an improvement and somewhat a downgrade from the original LNoE. The game balance is now more skewed towards the heroes and with new and more powerful cards the game sometimes feels a bit more fiddly and random in some small ways.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (October 2012)

I love zombies games so (perhaps :P) I’m a little biased toward them. I like Last night on Earth so I naturally like Timber Peak. I have not played it enough to give it a proper rating, however I like the new scenarios, characters and (most of all) the upgrade cards. Even zombies can learn something :D.

The fire markers in the game are nice to have but they had zero impact in our game.

For now this game is in my Like to have list (as 2 friends already bought it) but it is a must for LNOE fans.

Once upon a time, Last Night on Earth was favorite zombie game and one in my favorite games of all time. I have changed a lot since those days and I no longer are a fan of the Ameritrash genre. Due to this, my desire to play Last Night on Earth: Timber Peak is very low. I would do so if requested, but I won’t ever propose it.

For me, Last Night on Earth: Timber Peak is an ok game to play from time to time, so I’m downgrading its rating to reflect this. It is still among the best zombie games in the maket.

Changing the setting for the next sequel, Timber Peak has all new boards -- and, more importantly, the ability to upgrade your heroes and zombies as play goes on to develop the story a bit more. Strangely, though, it loses part of the atmosphere (but, then again, so do some sequels too).

BIG PLUS: standalone expansion that can be mixed with the base game for more challenges
PLUS: upgrades along the way
MINUS: atmosphere isn't fully transferred through from base to this one

We'd played the original Last Night on Earth - which my wife actually bought - back in 2011, and I'd hated it, with no-one else being particularly impressed. A total luckfest which is ridiculously biased in favour of the zombie team.

Well, it was a long time ago, so when one of those we played it with - the one who buys almost any game with zombies in it - produced this in the summer of 2014, I thought it would be OK to give it a try. In theory this one is better balanced because the heroes can gain "level ups" to become more powerful. Well, the game proved still ridiculously unbalanced (I did make some stupid mistakes playing some of the heroes, but they only hastened the inevitable), and still no fun at all. It's actually really a shame, because while I don't like zombie games in general, and dislike every other game I've played from this publisher, the premise of this game actually sounds kinda fun. But the implementation in LnoE - in both versions - fails to be a fun game, or even imo really a playable one.

Clearly a better version of the original Last Night on Earth game, by adding experience points and other neat aspects to the game. No point buying the original -- buy this instead. Also it lacks the CD of terrible music, so that's an obvious plus.

My only real complaint is that it takes a really long time to get to your next turn (often 15-20 minutes), and your turn takes like 1 minute at the most. It's even more disappointing if you don't get to do anything (or do much) because of the circumstances that your character is in.

When I first heard about Last Night on Earth I became mesmerized with it. When I bought Timber Peak, I fell in love. Upgrades made to the first game are so spot on, and the art is so thematic... What's not to love?

This standalone expansion should really be considered a version 1.5 of the LNOE system.  Timber Peak works hard to balance the swingy nature of base LNOE without sacrificing the fun and campiness of the original.

good expansion, and good stand alone game. Fun to play, and very thematic indeed. especially good when used as an expansion from the original game. that makes a massive map on the table.

8 = fun.  Similar to the first one this expansion provides upgrade cards to both the heroes and the zombies.  I didn’t know zombies could learn; but if movies have taught me one thing is that action movies need a tough antagonist, and Timber Peak makes it tough.  Love the dead simple fun fast gameplay and when you are done you have a story to tell.

I really wish that I had bought this game (which was available at the time) rather than the base set. As it stands, I really want it but I can't justify spending the money when I already own something that's 60% - 80% identical to it.

Experience system is added to this which the game was really needing.

Due to the leveling this standalone/expansion perfects an already great game.

I think I prefer the original game over this one. Experience points didn't feel that enjoyable. Fires were a nice addition.

I found it weird that there are some of the same characters as in the base game and they are now survivors. For this reason, I don't think this is the best expansion you can get. More of an alternative as a stand alone game.

I enjoyed the automatic zombie spawning rule from this set, which increased the tension for the humans, and plan to play with the new rule in most every scenario. As with the base game, if you are in the mood for some thematic, luck-filled zombie bashing, this game will suit you well. It's worlds better than Zombies!!!. As an "every once in a while" experience game, Timber Peak is fun.

Se puede considerar como el nuevo Juego Base de la serie LNOE, más que una expansión: sus reglas están actualizadas y completadas.

What? A 10?  It's not high enough for my favorite Zed game. And the sweet bonus is this one is a game in itself or an expansion. A must for any LNoE fanboy like myself.

Great expansion for LNOE. Adding experience points perfects a great game. Ups the power curve a bit compared against previous expansions.

Just as good as LNoE, different enough to keep it fresh, not different enough to need re-learning.

My preferred LNoE fix - I would always pick this over the 'vanilla' base game (even with expansions).

Timber Peak gives you a very tense cinematic zombie experience - I love it.

[i][b]One caveat:[/b][/i] You REALLY need to trim the decks to your liking, cutting away the dead wood, as it were - otherwise this game can get too damned random, or swingy.

New heroes, new scenarios, new cards. - That what most expansions gave You. But this one gave You a new fire rule (not used that often), and a leveling system, with great traits. That's the best thing in this expansion!

Interesting Game, I haven't gotten to play much so I will see how much I like it after a few more play throughs.

an amazing add on to the base game with new set pieces and zombies. can stand alone or be added on...which allows me to create a giant zombie slaying paradise.

2016-06-23 (rating 6.5):

I don't understand popularity of this game (as perceived in time when it came out). It is very random. And the deduction about who plays which color is hard since players are mostly limited by random draw. And doesn't really change much anyway...

This is a great game to play with the kids.  The bluffing aspect of the game can be loads of fun if you like table talk.  The game is fairly short as well.

The components are quite nice, if somewhat fiddly (?) because the turtle are flat and therefor don't stack all that well.  It's nothing that detracts from the game though.

Rated as a kids game.  My daughter took right to it.  We played the simple version, but it seems like it will  produce many more good plays.  Meaningful decisions, and she can fan those 5 small cards in her hand.

Update: Increased to 7.  It has some subtler strategies and she's pick up quickly!

RATING: 7
Popular game in China. Each player has a hidden turtle card of one colour. Each player in turn plays a card that moves a turtle forward or back one or two spaces. The first turtle over the line wins.

Each extra turtle on a single space stacks on top and a card that moves the bottom turtle moves all of them. This creates enough strategy to make the game interesting for adults.

'La Maxi Course Des Tortues' edition not yet listed on BGG. Only available in France I think. Has a longer course and larger playing cards. 

I'm not sure what to make of this one yet. I wasn't overly impressed after the first few playings. It just seems like a tumbleweed of turtles rolling towards the finish line and then one lucky player is in the right place at the right time and plays his crossing the line card.

Still a nice kids game, they seem to enjoy it but not a favourite.

A 5 minute game that I am always willing to play. It's great for children and also adults should not complain while playing this. The game is really random and is mostly about who gets the card that moves his turtle two spaces ahead.

Note: My copy is Ribbit from SimplyFun.
Is there such a thing as strategized luck?  I really like this one for the bit of mystery involved by not knowing what color everyone is.  With less than five players it is even possible for a frog not represented by a player to win the game.  Good game!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a very cute racing game for families.  Each player is given a secret turtle color.  Cards are played to move a certain color, and any turtles stacked on top of that one.  Turtles are slow, so movement is often only one space forwards or backwards.  The game is easily understood, as it is meant for children, but still provides opportunities for some tactics and finesse.  It has a similar feel to Heimlich & Co., which I also enjoy.  The turtle pieces are wooden and extremely cute.

It's an excellent game for what it is -- a kids-oriented game of bluffing and cardplay, moving (this is Ribbit) toads over a gameboard. Plays quick and is fun -- a whole heck of a lot better than Candyland -- if all American children played Ribbit instead of Candyland, a whole bunch of national measures like our consumer savings rate and our federal debt would, I contend, be a lot healthier. Recommended.

Carrera de Tortugas.
Filler senzillet i curiós on cadascú porta una tortuga (d'un color diferent), però ningú sap qui controla cada color. Mitjançant cartes, fas avançar, retrocedir o posar tortugues unes damunt les altres.

Mediocre at best. It plays the same almost every time. 

The author claims it is for 2-5 players. I say it's a blatant lie. It doesnt't work for 2 or even 3 people. 

The author also claims it is for players aged 5 and up. I say it is for kids aged 5-9 only. Unless you suffer from a mental disorder which prevents you from playing other games forcing you to use your brain.

RATING: 7
A very inviting game for 4 year olds.  Colorful, nice graphics, short, easy & fun.  A nice little game where children who can keep secrets learn to be crafty in game playing.  For younger children, as the rules suggest, the color of a player's turtle is not secret--children simply race, moving their turtle ahead, moving others back.

Lovely race game for the salad in the garden. It looks simplistic, but there's more to it than meets the eye. Sometimes you want to break away, sometimes you want to bluff, sometimes you want to take a ride on someone else's back, or send them back on their path. All in all you never really know who's who, as the color of the player is hidden, so you have to be careful which cards you play to move which turtles. 

Really enjoyable game with both adults and kids. Plays very quick.

Rating based on playing with children.  This is a good introduction to bluffing games for children, so it's probably not ideal (but still fun) for children under 5.  The components are nice, though the cards could be sturdier.  But the game is very simple and it's fun to see kids try to learn to hide which turtle they are.  There's nothing new here, the hidden identity mechanism is probably more fun in Geistertreppe, and the stacking thing is a staple of many other games.

Young kids aren't good at deception, but this game's card system does an admirable job of shielding their goals for them.

I don't want to play this game often, but I've always played it a few times in a row, and I've enjoyed it every time, including plays without kids. The key here is that it doesn't outstay its welcome.

Useful tool to teach the small folk lying effectively. 
From 
'[i]Hey, I'm with the red turtle! I like turtles.[/i]', through
'[i]Um... I'm with the blue turtle... *blink*[/i]', to even 
'[i]Look, he played a red ++! He sure is with red! *trying not to blink*[/i]'. 

Other than this, it's a fair racing/bluffing game. Not overly exciting with kids, mind you, but a light, fun one nevertheless.

Simple but clever race mechanisn where played action cards move all turtles on the moved turtle's back. The hidden colors, the tactical card selection and the children's theme make this a game for the whole family.

From a gamer's perspective, there seems to be a problem with the end game - either wait for and hold on to a +2 card in your color to win or choose which other color to help. (I won thanks to the latter...)

Simply guess the colour of your opponents turtle to hinder them while bluffing and advancing your own turtle to victory.

RATING: 6
First impression (3 players): It's a simple game for kids (or us childish enough gamers). You play a card and move a tortoise accordingly forwards or backwards. The trick of the game is that tortoises stack up and can be moven in a big piles. First one to move his own to the last spot on the track wins (or in case of several tortoises moving at once the tortoises are checked in a bottom-upwards order for the winner). Usually I don't like too much of these secret-goal games but this one is short enough filler where it doesn't matter too much. I wouldn't play the game with full 5 players as then there is no chance for bluffing as no tortoise is neutral.

RATING: 7
[Children's Game] Racing and bluffing. The bluffing part is a nice touch, otherwise the game would not be that interesting. Even though the turtles are occasionally moved backward, the card distribution is such that the game won't drag.

The cards are a bit thin but otherwise the components are nice. The turtles are adorable.

RATING: 5
A hidden colour game, which I don't particularly enjoy, especially with kids as you can't ham it up, provide encouragement, congratulate the good moves, etc, as the game progresses, deducting the fun. This borrows the piggyback feature from Russelbande which is nice. Which means you're encouraged to move other pieces when your colour benefits. But the strategy is to first draw the +2 in your colour, wait for someone else to move your colour at the end to within 2 spaces of the finish line, and then finish it. Bad luck otherwise.

Sadly lacks the visuals to appeal to my boys, and I suspect by the time they grasp the bluffing aspect the game would appear too childish too. I suspect there are better games using the piggyback mechanism (Mahe and Spinderella come to mind).

I love the visual status of race games i.e. first over line wins, with the mechanics involved in the "running" of the game either making or breaking the design for me. This tortoise race has the interesting hidden identity element seen in Heimlich, Clans etc, but the novel feature is that tortoises can piggyback, moving with the underlying activated piece. I'd definitely play again but with less than 4 for more thoughtful control.

Excellent racing game for kids while still being enjoyable by adults. Hidden identities for the racers adds some nice tension and carrying other players around with you adds a level of cooperation.

Little game in size but WHAT A GREAT GAME! Most people make the mistake of lightly evaluate an artistic section or a graphic design work in a board game, that is, people don´t bear in mind if an artistic style is appropriate (or not) to a certain theme, and give more points to a "more elaborate" art. From my side, the artistic work must be fused with the theme and mood that you, as a designer, want to give to the whole, and in this game fits perfectly "art style" with "mood", from my point of view. And about the game itself, it´s just an easy, quick, fun, and very enjoyable bluff card game for any age, and it´s one of my Reiner Knizia´s favourites.

Quite risky, but ok - once You knew somehow that an opponent doesn't have one turtle move it every time you can to distract. Than after it when You'll probebly collect more cards useable to your turtle start moving it still using minus carda, etc. to gather more you color cards. That way you should win. It's more a game of skill when you play 2 player games.

Fun game with kids or when played quickly by adults, or a mixture. Three players seems to be best, but any number other than five is recommended. If you accept the game for what it is then it's fun, brings on a groan or two and can be played with children as young as four. Quite funny to test whether kids have learned what bluffing means - there's some point in their development when they get how to not give away which colour is theirs.

Interestingly, they like to play both with public turtles as well as private turtles.  I was really surprised by this.  Of course, they are not always very good at hiding which turtle is theirs, though they sometimes do surprise me.  [02/02/2008]

Fast, fun, and funny game to play with kids.  The bluffing aspect works exceptionally well (even with younger kids whose "hidden" identity quickly becomes pretty obvious in games like Heimlich & Co.) because there's more inherent ambiguity involved when moving one marker simultaneously moves other markers as well (and when the markers that travel together keep changing.)

RATING: 7
[Winning Moves 'Schildkroetenrennen' 2004 edition] {Turtle, racing, couple, kid; card-based, pawn-stacking, secret identity} Schildkroetenrennen is decent children game, and can be a good family game. It's fast-paced and full of fun. Welcome by children and my friends. Children have no problem in understanding the rules. However, the open identity variant is more suitable for them.

Schildkroetenrennen comes as a complete revelation to me.  I didn't expect it can be that fun and good with such a simple concept and cute graphic.  It quickly becomes a favorite game among my play groups. (I have already ordered more than 10 copies for my friends.)

The turtle theme is strong. (Turtles really stack together!) It works well as a racing game.   The cards and turtles are colorful and cute.

It is luck-dependent (it's a children game, anyway) due to the card draw. Sometimes, a player needs some cards badly but they can't draw them.  Nonetheless, it's a hand management game: players have to manage their hand wisely so that they have useful cards for their disposal all the time. The third last field of the track is very crucial; try not moving turtles there unless you can win.

[rules] There are 2 confusing rules: 1. what happens if a player has a hand of minus card when all turtles are on start field; 2. what happens when a stack of turtle moves back to the start field. We play it this way: 1. the player just discards a card and draws a new one; 2. the stack will not break when it moves back to the start field.

[new edition] The illustration of the SimplyFun edition is quite horrible for me. It's much more expensive, too. I am glad that I have the turtle edition.

A great childrens game with hidden identities like for instance Heimlich & co.
I suspect this will be a good game for adults too, but I haven't tested  that yet. 
One drawback, though, the cards are very thin and should be thicker in a game for 5 year olds. I fear the cards are going to wear out soon....

the reason Knizia has so many games is that many of them are like "mechanism studies" - games that are entirely based on one single mechanism or principle. and yet he manages to do it with such ability, that most of the games end up being much more than just "playable". this children's game here is another good example of Knizia's designing skills: ridiculously simple and yet really nice. we play it with the kids and also often as a session ending, when nobody's able to deepthinking anymore...

Highly playable with kids. Excellent game with great mechanism but simple setup and attractive parts. Do not underestimate the 9-space racing length, the game is often tense. The hidden identity is fun. Best played with 3P or 4P, then 2P, because unused identities become neutral stakes.

An incredibly cute game in both its presentation and its gameplay. Most important decision during the game is to decide when to "reveal" your color and go for the finish line. The game is not very exciting for two adults, but it should be a lot better with 3-4 players and/or a couple of five year olds to play it with.
UPDATE: Played three times with 4 (two adults and kids aged 5 and 7) and everybody enjoyed it quite a lot. I especially like how the kids had the same chance to win as the adults. It is a short game, so it is easy to play multiple times in one evening. Rating reflects playing with kids.

Very cool little game! It worked suprisingly well as 2 player game for adults. I suppose it is better with less players as you have more interesting moves you can make. I have to try with kids next, but it definetely has a place in my collection already!

This light little turtle racing game is fun.  Mechanically dissimilar, but spiritually similar to Hemilich & Co.  Secret identities means you don't know who you help as you try to remain anonymous long enough to get within striking distance of the win.

This is absolutely fantastic.  Great with children, even very young ones, but would work well with just cut-throat adults playing.  It is more chaotic with 5, more strategic with 2, but both characteristics are present in good balance with any number of players.

RATING: 7
Clever game. Good kids game that also makes for a decent filler game for adults. Players want their turtle to finish first, or at the bottom of the stack of turtles that finish first. Colors are secret. Big luck element, but with the hand of cards you have some control.

Good kids game that also makes for a decent filler game for adults. Artwork is fun and there are nice elements of simple strategy involved. Recommeded for kids from 5+.

Great kids game - teaches them bluffing a bit since they have to keep their identity hidden.
Fun for adults too (with kids or even without :)

RATING: 8
Rating as children's game. My 4 year old doesn't like it that much, probably because it's still too difficult for him to bluff. But this game by itself is very good for children - simple, fun, both tactical and strategical.

Cute game, my 4yo enjoys it. It's interesting because this is a game where she can actually strategize, since she understands the whole flow of the game well enough.

Against adults only, I'd put this game at a 4.

Addendum: Now she is 5, has had it for over a year. It has had great staying power, she still requests it!

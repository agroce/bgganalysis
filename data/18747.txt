 Juego muy interesante, que gana cuantos más jugadores participen. Hay dos bandos, cristianos y musulmanes, pero estos bandos se pueden pelear entre ellos, haciendolo muy divertido. Una redacción de reglas penosa y muy complicada hacen que este juego solo pueda aprenderese de mano de alguien que sepa jugar previamente.

RATING: 7
Muliplayer, card activated system for moving leaders and armies in the crusades. At first glance it appears difficult for the Christians to win with all the attrition and inability to raise new troops. However they start with enough troops early on to capture a few cities. I'd like to play it again!

Update: Well it is still a hard slog for the Christians, but they can definitely take over a bunch of cities. Maybe with a little luck they can pull a win, since it is not really a game of Christians v. Muslims but everyone is really for themselves. Anyway I find this game to be too complex for its own good. I don't like all the charts necessary to conduct combat, with almost everything determined by dice rolling. It would have been better to design a system that allows for the generals to choose their formation for example, perhaps in a rock paper scissors system, rather than having a dice roll determine formation. Overall I would have preferred to see less dice rolling in combat and more player control, or even a simpler combat system like in Berg's Pax Romana.

"I'd wish to have at least the name of the location as well."

The circled numbers (points) on the gamemap do not represent population centers (towns, villages, whatever), but are an integral part of the Movement/Attrition system and, thereby, represent difficulty in that factor.


"Currently I have to say I'm more likely to purchase 
MMP's upcoming Kingdom of Heaven..."

KINGDOM OF HEAVEN (the title is a  change from the original OUTREMER and was my Xmas gift suggestion to designer Scott de Brestien (I hope I got that right) is not about The  Crusades but the entire "reign" of The Kingdom of Jerusalem, a most interesting, and inimically internecine political situation.)

nice game bot TOO MUCH rules questions. Played the 1st crusade 4 times and the 2nd crusade even more and have further on rulequestions because the rulebook gives no answer for many situations. Hope for new living rules otherwise I don´t want to play that game anymore.The battle resolution works not good. You can attack with much more troops, win the combat and lose more units! This depends on the percentage-system for losses. For example: I attack with 40 troops a defender with 15 troops. An average diceroll (7; +2 mod for more troops) with two dice gives a result of 10% losses for the attacker and 15% losses for the defender. This means the attacker (=winner) will lose 4 troops and the defender (=loser)will lose only 3 troops. Often it´s better to left your troops home cause they don´t give any or only very small advantages but you will lose more troops. Doesn´t seem to be logical.

Despite being burned by Alexander the Great last year, I was intrigued by this game. It borrows quite a bit from Carthage, a game I rather liked. The complexity appears not out of hand. There are some interesting multi-player opportunities. And the situation is appealing (even if the title is a touch lame, but GMT is notorious for lame game titles and Onward Christian Soldiers is far from their worst).

So I'm looking forward to giving this a try.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Certainly looks interesting. I find the map's look - similar to the Alexander game - most appealing though those alphanumerical dot labels are incredibly soulless and antithematic. Perhaps they are needed for some gameplay reason, but I'd wish to have at least the name of the location as well.

Currently I have to say I'm more likely to purchase MMP's upcoming Kingdom of Heaven, but perhaps Onwards Christian Soldiers will yet win me over. I need a Crusades game which I enjoy. I'm afraid Crusader Rex was utterly disappointing (v1.4) to this HotS fan...

1 play (4p), a learning game. We played about half the first crusade (8.5 hours including lunch). Including me, 3 of the 4 liked it enough to try again. Rules are sometimes tough.  I think if it were ~20-30% easier rules (and thus quicker also), a lot of wargamers would love it. The movement rules (with related attrition) and 1C leader activation work well. The full combat system made great sense after playing it, but still is a lot of steps. I also liked the multiplayer aspect of the 1C. I made 3/4 inch wooden leader counters.

From: http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX?8@@.1dd08e5f

Clarifications and Changes 
1. Addition to 4.5 and 12.0: Click here. 

(4.5 4.5: Change the third bullet to read "2 Draw Event cards (see 12.0)". Then, add the following sentence to the paragraph following the bulleted list: 

"After he plays or holds this card, the player on the other side whose Leader Activation Card was last drawn (Crusaders and Muslims are the two sides, remember) draws one of his own side’s Event cards. See 12.0 for details.")

(12.0 Q: 1C rulebook P.11 E. "Armored Knights and Attrition." 2nd sentence says 5SPs or more most be lost to trigger AK attrition loss. Yet the 4th sentence has an army losing 3SPs also losing AKs to attrition. Is this correct? 

A. The example in the first paragraph in 6.3D is wrong - it should read, "If an Army of 30 ASPs loses 5 ASP to attrition, and therefore loses 16.6%, ... it also loses 1 AK." )
2. The Jordan River consists of the river paths K5-K6, L2-L1, and L2-Jericho.
3. No forces may enter the Crusader entry areas (A, B, and C) for any reason. Only Mosul Turk forces may enter the Cappodocia of Mosul Turk boxes, and only for recruitment purposes (see 5.5) - or to place a replacement leader (7.2H). For the Fatimid box, see the last rule in 6.1.
4. Here's how to handle distributing the event card to each player at the start of the game: Each player gets one May-Be-Held card. Each player draws one and checks it and sees if he can hold it. If not, he reveals it (so that nobody dumps one he simply doesn't like) and draws another, until he gets one he can keep. After everybody does this, the deck is reshuffled.
5. 3rd Crusade note: The Saracen Reinforcement Activation Markers were not included with the countermix. Use the two Baldwin or Unur AMs from the 2nd Crusade in their place. Proper markers will appear in a future issue of C3i magazine.

For when and what this game is trying to simulate I am a huge fan.  At the time I first began playing it, I appreciated the many new or redefined concepts around how movement and supply or activation were handled which work really well for the type of campaigning and relative strengths of the foes. The unpredictable results of battles further demonstrated an important characteristic of fighting in this period.  It is for these reasons of modeling rules done so well that they capture the challenges and choices that the protagonists faced in the period that this game rates so highly for me.

It took me a week to learn this game, as I was teaching myself, and had to make many references to threads here and on consimworld to get the hang of everything, as there are some contradictions, errors, and omissions in the rules.  Hopefully that will be corrected with the living rules.  I can't say it is worth the effort.  Berg + Randall + GMT = game kit.

Your forces can move as far as they want, if you are willing to lose them to attrition.  The siege system works well, as there are several options at your disposal.  The game uses a chit-pull system, but you can decide what chits to put into the cup, so your opponent will not know exactly who remains to move.

I have only played this solo (2nd crusade), and would expect to rate higher if I get to play against another person.  I would love to play the 7 player first crusade scenario sometime, as that seems like the way the game was designed to be played.  The 2nd and 3rd crusade scenarios seem like they were added later, as an afterthought.

RATING: 5
My rating here is somewhat unfair as I have only read the rules - I would normally not give a rating without playing. I was hoping for something around 'War of the Ring' complexity/feel but based on the crusades. Instead we have a rules megafest - there may well be a good game lurking in there but it's going to be a lot more work to find out than I'd hoped. Still I like the subject so will wade in at some point - I'm just getting lazy (and shorter on time) in my middle age.

If Kingdom of Heaven is any good ,and actually ever gets published, I may well sell this.

In terms of game design, has similarities to Carthage, which I thought was pretty good, except for Carthage's ridiculous lack of playable scenarios. OCS can become a little bit static, given the profusion of castles and cities and the lack of manoeuvring space, but the chit draw does an adequate job to keep the game moving along. The lack of playable scenarios in Carthage is fixed here. The 2nd and 3rd Crusade (historical) are quite playable. I'll pass on the 7-player 1st Crusade. If I want to play an overwrought and [i]random[/i] Diplomacy game, I'll play Diplomacy instead.

I'd rate it a 7 but I have to dock a point for two things. 1) The rulebook - the rules are not overly complex and can be internalised after a few moves. However, the rulebook is badly edited and proofed and makes it very annoying to read. 2) Given the different types of attrition in the game, I'd have preferred all the different types of attrition are put on the player aid for a one-stop reference. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Very 'fiddly' game that is overly complicated for the payoff.  One of our players is an ASL regular and he found it "needlessly overcomplicated."  It has flashes of greatness, but it's buried under a lot of needless chrome. (The 1.5:1 charts vs a simple 2:1 rule, the ability to retreat virtually endlessly, and the "pick a random chit to buy your cards" rules are just a few examples)  I didn't HATE it, but there are about 200 games I'd pull out before I would pull it out.

Excellent.  All three Crusades and the "What-if".  Fairly easy to learn.  I do believe that the First Crusade is most always a Muslim victory.  There are 2 rule books; one for the First Crusade and one for the Second and Third Crusades. The transition from one game to the other is easy.  There are only slight differences in the First versus the Second and Third Crusades, but the differences makes the games very fun and interesting.

The reason that I did not rate this game a 10 is because of the various errors and ambiguities in the rules.  At first I received answers to my questions about the rules and then I received no responses.  This is very unusual for the makers of the GMT games and perhaps my questions were lost.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt but there still is a need to update and correct the current rules as they are.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
So far I'm doing the playtest and am impressed by the game already.

What I like so far:

1. Excellent movement attrition system, basically point to point movement, armies(units may only move with leaders). Armies maybe move as far as possible only stopped by enemy units. The farther they move though the more chances they can incur losses due to attrition.

This is quite well done and done in a simple way so there is little or no bookeeping.

So basically the larger your forces and the farther you move, you can easilly attrit yourself which is really historical.

2. What I also liked, the card system used, players draw random activation points and use this to purchase leader cards and put them into a mutual activation deck and players draw cards and this either activates leaders or does something else(event cards etc.).

I really like this since it varies each game and makes the game really replayable and unexpected.

3. The combat system is quite nice as a leader figures critically here since a better leader can do better tactics in order to affect combat. This is done is a simple way.

So far this is the first crusade and I am already liking the game and I think this is quite historical which is made fun to play and replayable by the card play. Very highly recomended.

Needs living rules.  The design is pretty much abandoned by its designer and developer.  Beware.

Update:  Designer's response to realization that most players have problems with the rules:  

"I trust - well, hope - you are aware of the science (yes, the science) that is behind writing such manuals. There is a base problem: no two people read instructions/rules.etc the same way. What is Clarity for one is Opacity to another: same words, same rules . . .different reaction. This is not just a random observation; it is based on my ex-wife's professional experience in the art and skill of communication and presentation . . .and she )literally_ wrote the book on it."

RATING: 7
The 1st Crusades is a multi-players diplomatic game, I sure you got the more players, the more funs will got on playing the game.

Operation cycles by random leader activation, when a leader activated, you can perfrom movement, there are no movement point limit, however there are attrition limit, the far you travel the more soldiers you lose. There is a momentum system for leader can continue keep activated and perform their action, the better the leader, the easy they can get the momentum.

Many other elements such as field battles, siege of city, ravage city, sortie fight, relief fight of city, naval rules, bribes on netural force, treachery, all are included in the game.

On the 1st Crusades, it is so funny that the enemies is not only your opposite side, sometime your parnter is your enemy too.

Only played the 2nd and 3rd Crusade scenarios so far. Onward Christian Soldiers uses a stripped-down and thus potentially far more accessible version of the Ancient World rules system. So what the game loses in chrome (and theme) ought to be compensated by enhanced playability. Unfortunately unclear rules and general fiddliness make both the 2nd and 3rd Crusade scenarios too lengthy for what they offer in terms of game play.

Definitely a favorite.  This is a solid game about the Crusades with scenarios for the First, Second, and Third Crusade.  The First Crusade plays from 1-7 players.  Each of the other scenarios plays only two players.  The attrition mechanism of this game is my favorite ever.  Its your will and the weight of your army against the friction of the terrain.  Beautiful and utterly vicious...  Siege rules are excellent as well.  The combat system is very similar to Carthage - which for me is a big plus: it is an interesting system with a chance for very unpredictable results.  The presentation is fantastic, especially the card art.  In short, Onward Christian Soldiers is a very fascinating, engaging game that will be heavy in the rotation.  It needs a few more multiplayer scenarios to be just exactly perfect.

Great Design about operational medieval warfare. The game runs on a lightweighted and improved Ancient-World engine (from Rise of the Roman Republic & Carthage, both titles also published by GMT). Movement and Attrition is eased because it is a point-to-point system with attrition values already printed in the points. More importantly bluff and deception is introduced because not all leaders can be moved at utmost, the players have secretly to decide which leaders are more active than others.

Game system is a 10, but:
 
- Rating down by two because the rules (version 1.0) are a mess. Ambiguities and holes, information found in places you would not expect it. It has to be admitted that it is a challenge to write rules for this type of design, but because already two titles of the Ancient-World system are published the deficiencies are still astonishing.

- Rating down by another two because no clear concept regarding number/organisation of players is recognisable - 2-player? Multi-player? 2-Teams-play? To try all has not worked, either the game system or the victory conditions do not fit.

A remake of "The Crusades" (SPI) with better counters, rules and scenarios but with a hideous map.

Comment based on a 7 players game of the First Crusade.

The rules are not very clear but the result is good and we had fun time playing it.
The battles are very hard to win for the muslim so they have mostly to wait for attrition to reduce the crusader power.

I'm deeply ambivalent about this game. I love the period and detail, but the game is proceedurally odd. It occasionally feels more like an accounting excersize than a game.

RATING: 8
Have had a few sessions with the First Crusade, two each with the Second and Third. Rulebook is a little scattered and obscure in places, but the quick-start rules help a lot. The system is very nice, once you start getting a proper hold on it. The interaction of who can go, and how much they can do really shines once you see it in action.

Rating is still provisional, and could change once I'm a bit more practiced at the game. However, the more I see, the more it looks like a solid enduring design that deserves an '8'.

There were several aspects of this game I liked. The First Crusade can be set up for 7 players, four Christian and three Moslem, with infighting and lots of diplomacy and strategical choices to make up for unbalanced faction strength (something good, in my book, for a historical simulation of the era). The Second and Third Crusades are 2 player-games I haven't tried yet. Game Mechanics flow smoothly with the random turn order (leader cards) and events, while combat is something you want to avoid - true to history - and is quite nicely balanced between predictable results and random surprises. More important is attrition and supply lines, something which even the smallest faction can have a big impact on.

On the less bright side, the rulebook seems to be written for a rules lawyer, covering sometimes silly exceptions to great length, and the whole read can be a huge threshhold before you actually get down to play. I also found a few historically questionable details, such as the faction names, but the overall impression is so good as to make nitpicking feel unnecessary. You play the game like you actually are an 11th century noble and the end result hangs in the balance until the last few turns, unless you make a few early mistakes like discounting attrition (as a Christian) and allowing the Southern Syrians to grow too large (as a Moslem).

If you're into the era and want a solid, challenging game with a fairly balanced and historically believable multi-player aspect, this one is well  worth trying.

Think I'll wait for the living rules before going any further with this. Looks cool though.

At first I was a bit leary to get into it since the rules were a bit more complex. However, once I started playing I thought it was a well done game that seems to capture the period. One of the biggest concerns I had was what kind of stratgey will each side use since there are so many actions a side can perform. As I play that factor disappears as you learn what to do. I listed the weight as medium heavy but I think it is closer  to a medium. Overall, I believe this wargame would be for players who were interested in the period and wanted a deeper game. Kingdom of Heaven and Crusader Rex might be better suited for those who want a lighter, quicker? game.
 One rule I thought was odd was in the events section where if a city or Eddesa revolts, Saladin  gets transported if by magic to the area or city in revolt. This rule reminded me of the old Kingmaker game where nobels got moved that way. If it were me I would have made the rule where the Saracen player  had to have Saladin spend his AMs to get to the location in rebellion then spend one AM in the location to put down the rebellion.

But overall I believe it is a well done game on the subject.

RATING: 7
Very tough game to play.  In other words, if you play this game don't be surprised if you feel frustrated several times during each game turn.  To play it well, you gotta love a challenge.

I like the game a lot, but have problems with play balance in the multiplayer First Crusade scenario.  I've played it three times and feel that the Southern Syrians have a huge advantage.  I'm very really curious how a game is played by very experienced players.  The Sicilian Normans are at a disadvantage due to size.  And the Northern Syrians will have a multi-front war going on the whole game without a good diplomacy strategy. 

I do like the game because of the complexity of diplomatic choices each player has.  I also like the game for its glimpse into a complex war.  And I just like some of the rules mechanics: attrition movement, combat, and leaders.

It is a hard war to play, especially as a crusader. Great challenge.

The combat system is too messy. It calls for many steps to obtains a final modifier to the dice roll in the combat result tables ..... but the combat result table is chaotic. You struggle to get a +1 in the rill, but a 9 is worst than a 8 ... but a 8 is best than a 7... it makes no sense. If combat result chaos of the middle age warfare has to be simulated... it's pointless to calculate modifiers in a such accurate way. If you want to kill mosquitoes with a cannon, the caliber of the cannon is irrelevant.

Despite obscure rules and lack of errata to correct the issues, this one is a great game on the crusades, and introduces chrome without hampering the play with minutia (once you get over the many not-so-clear areas of the rules, that is).

This is what I consider a card assisted game rather than a CDG.  If you don't mind the complexity and like the treatment of the period, this one is worth the purchase if you can find it as it covers all three crusade periods.  Typical GMT quality with a nice paper map and functional counters.

Components are top notch, rulebook is interesting to read.  I'm guessing that this is the definitive Crusades game.  Several turns solo in the 1st crusade so far, and having fun!  Game is easier than you might think from looking at the heft of the rulebook and charts.

Played the game for a few hours and then gave up, as it was the least enjoyable wargame I'd played in some considerable time. It looks great, but somehow the gameplay is sorely lacking. Sold it in very short order.

[We haven't played this one yet, but I have read through the quick start guide and, despite the amount of documentation in the game it actually seems quite straightforward. I'm looking forward to playing this one and hopefully trying out the game with four or more players too.]

1/27/08 - It turns out continuation rolls are the key to getting the crusaders anywhere.  Once again, a second play has paid dividends.

1/14/08 - Well, my second game of the 1st crusade (with 6) came to pass.  The game is not too shabby.  It seems GMT went to great lengths to see if they could make this game as accessible as possible, and they seem to have succeeded to a modest degree.  So far, figuring out how to get anywhere with the crusaders seems to be the challenge - cooperation appears imperative.  Looking forward to another go.

12/19/07 - Game didn't seem to be anything too special after first play (1st crusade with 3 players) and I sort of wished for Crusader Rex while I was playing, however, I know I can't pass judgment until I've played it at least once more, and it looks like another game (with > 3) is scheduled for early January.

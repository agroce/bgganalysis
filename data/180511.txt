LIKE: I really enjoyed the bidding with action tokens, it made the game a lot of fun and tight. The happy/sad stage faces was a good mechanism for player interaction.
DISLIKE: A bit fiddly with the chits. The scoring board could be larger or with smaller scoring tokens. The stage element, where tokens are placed, lacked any interesting theme. Scoring goals were a bit of a mystery our first play through.

OVERALL: This is a solid euro, but I wasn't enamored with it probably because of the dry theme. It seems to blend in with many other games. Very similar to Drum Roll, as they both hire performer cards, but I like Drum Roll's theme slightly better.

Shakespeare has no 'new' features, but it combines existing technices of existing games in a well designed new game. It would not be the first game I would recommend to someone, but there are enough aspects that will make you enjoy the game. I don't have much experience with this game but it certainly feels like there is more than one way to victory.

A euro with a fun theme wherein each player sets up a theater, hires actors as well as costume and set designers (cards that give you benefits) that must be paid at the end of the game.  Decent, but not interactive enough for my tastes.  Not a huge fan of the blind bidding, tight money, meager VP's, and sleeping mechanic.

Played 3X at BGG and loved every minute of it.

Pros:
+ Fun mechanic to bid number of works which determines number of actions and player order
+ Very difficult decisions and long term planning to determine who to rest
+ Can play in 90 minutes with the right group
+ Thematic and wonderful artwork.
+ Multiple paths to victory.  I won 2 out of 3 games and placed 2nd in the third.  One game I had two additional actors and focused on high efficiency turns with bidding 3/2/3 actions in the final 3 rounds.  In another, I built all of the set pieces and hired only two additional actors.  In the last, I had 6 actors fully clothed, including two extras.  

Cons:
- Could be "too pasted on" for some people.  
- The decisions and advanced planningcould be too "thinky" for some people

I adore this game but the biggest drawback to it is the almost complete and utter lack of player interaction.  About the only way you interact with others is by taking an actor they want, set pieces, or costume pieces before they do.  Otherwise you are just kind of doing your own thing in this game and to me that isn't a bad thing.  You're competing production companies trying to put on the best productions you can to win the game.

Nice Euro, I love upgrading the character cards with costume tokens, and just how the theme soaks through this one, also how the various tracks (ambiance, etc) fluctuate back and forth based on the actions you're taking. Probably the best game released to date involving The Bard, even if its eponymous title seems less creative.

RATING: 8
Very solid game in a sea of sameness.  I love the unique theme and the "More strategy than you first though" victory mechanics.  It may seem a little intimidating at first to learn but after a few turns it makes complete sense.  The theme is great and honestly very consistent.  Some games use a theme as a cheap veneer that could be stripped off and any other theme applied over top.  Not so with the this game.  Each element, each ability and scoring avenue really makes you feel like you are preparing for a play.  It's incredibly well done and a very beautiful looking game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.8
Nice looking artwork for this pretty basic worker placement with a twist where a) you decide your order of play by blind bidding with the number of your workers at the start of each of the 6 rounds and b) by having advanced and unique places (via drafting cards)for your workers where one worker can activate multiple actions at the same time on the main board. It takes a few rounds to get the mechanisms and a full run to get how final scoring works and what kind of special cards exist in the game (you’ll probably see all of them during a run-through). Pleasant if you don’t play with AP prone people, but easily passable in my book (especially since the theme doesn’t intrigue me personally either).

Each turn plays quick and the scoring is tight. You really need to focus on squeezing every last point out of the limited actions you have. The bidding is interesting and its somewhat interesting to hire actors that are portraying popular Shakespearean characters, but those are the few wrinkles this game seems to bring over other euros. Honestly, I struggled to find something that seemed engaging from its game play. 

Shakespeare is primarily comprised of a disc-pushing central board and tableau building player boards. Between the turn order bidding and the card drafting, the ingredients for a good game seem to be there and the game does generate many interesting decisions, but there's not much that is pulling me back to the game. The theme seems kind of wasted aside from the moments when familiar characters come out and/or enter your tableau. The other "thematic" trappings (e.g., collecting of costumes and installation of set pieces) aren't much different than those found in other farming-themed or antiquity-themed euro games. For example, the costumes could just as easily be animals and the actors could just as easily be farm hands. One other thing: the rule book is hilariously awful. It doesn't even get through set up without forgetting to include something. The mechanisms themselves work fine together, but the game--as a package of its mechanisms and production--suffers from fatal flaws: it is boring and forgettable.

Played a 3 player game of 1 of my 3 birthday gift games with Brian and Sander. I was able to get the victory as I moved the farthest on each of the 3 "Act" tracks. This is a fantastic middle weight Euro game. There are enough tough decisions to burn your brain, but the game is super easy to teach. The initial draft of the bonus actor or craftsman that each player get seems to be super important. I will introduce this to Flo soon as I think she will really enjoy it as well.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.25
Such a tight competitive worker placement game. High scores are in the 20's. Every choice is incredibly important as scores are so low and you must squeeze every point possible. The turn order and number of actions is dynamically determined by blind bidding at the beginning of each round (reminiscent of Dungeon Petz, but different). So there is an auction element to the number and order of actions. There is more player interaction than your average worker placement game, and this bidding for actions process is a big factor. Additionally, you really care about what your opponents capabilities are, so you want to try and grab whatever character or costume or set dressing your opponents want before they can nab it first. The design is cleverly interconnected as to how the various elements and mechanics interact and balance. It all creates a very thematic experience as well. Still quite abstracted, but the theme comes across well through the gameplay.

Shakespeare reminds me a bit of the Princes of Florence with regard to long term planning. It's not nearly as tied to long term planning as PoF, but it does have it. I enjoyed our play considerably more than I expected and I anticipate playing this again. Admittedly, I won't be seeking it out like other games. I do expect to play it again.

Second play was very good and I like this game and will play it again. Doesn't seem to be a lot of replay ability but enough for me.

Played 3 or 4 times now. It's one of those euros where the theme is strong enough not to let the game feel too abstract. But it's still a hard core euro. Victory points are extremely tight in this game, so the slightest mistake can cost you the game - although you won't know that until the end. A great mechanism is how you bid with action points. Player order is very important, but if you bid many action points, you end up last in line. There are lots of little timing decisions to be made on several fronts. It tickles the brain without giving you a headache.

Not too heavy, clean rules, great theme, and a pleasant length without too much downtime.

8 or 9 plays till this day. Still holds up well without getting bored. That's a sign of a great game.

The perfect little light Euro: it's simple to teach, it plays in a relatively short time, and it has just enough tough decisions, competition over resources, and end game doubts to make the game incredibly tense and engaging throughout. 

The art is wonderful and the theme is original and well-implemented. Some things like the stage design and certain character abilities are very forced and athematic, but that never bothers me in a mechanics-oriented Euro like this. I'd almost call this a gateway game, but it might be slightly too complex for new gamers.

I played the prototype 2 years ago, and the heart of the game is still here : the blind bidding and the nice theme.
I did not find any interest in bidding less than 4 tokens, too many actions do not depend on the other players.
Well executed game but still a bit dry for me.
How come there's not the designer's name on the box cover ??

I think I'm just getting jaded by generic euros these days, as Shakespeare is a very solidly built game, but failed to do anything I thought was exciting or novel. There's nothing to really dislike here (other than the turn order mechanism, which I wasn't a fan of), but there's nothing that makes me say, "Wow! That was cool!", either. Just the standard placing workers to do stuff that scores you points in fairly bland ways.

I'd still play it if someone else wanted to, as it wasn't bad, but it wouldn't be my idea to play.

Relatively quick, easy to teach, tight medium-weight optimization game, a solid addition to Ystari's line. The highlight of the game is the novel blind bidding, initiative vs. action points juggling mechanism. I usually dislike blind bidding, but this has real predictive capacity built-in, so it's quite a hoot. Shakespeare is a finely balanced multi-path VP gathering game, where players have to optimize exchange rates conversion (boy that sounds boring..). The second violin mechanically is the "keep 1 of your previous turn action spots only" rule, that results in quite a bit more complexity that a vanilla action sport refresh. 

Ovearall, nothing terribly new, but well executed and fun. The components are solid but not spectacular, and I do have to complain about the size of the box which is unnecessarily big and a departure from the classic Ystari format. Boo for that.

Keep in mind that the best player count is probably 3-4, as there is quite a bit of luck of the draw involved with the costume and set tokens, as well as the card drafting.

Very good game with great artwork and a very thematic feel to it. I really enjoy how players start in an almost identical setup but end up with a completely unique set of actors (actions) that they can use in a turn. The only thing holding this game down for me is the tremendous amount of anxiety bidding tends to give both my partner and myself. Anyone not as fragile as us will probably really enjoy it.

First Impression: Some nice ideas here, but nothing real exciting. Also some small problems, which add up and make the game less enjoyable for me. Examples: bad iconography, disctracting illustrations on Cards, much downtime, unbalanced Cards (some cards are clearly always better than others), small deck of cards may lead to uninteresting replays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
First impression: a dull, run-of-the-mill combination of worker placement and action growth. The game, such as there is, is very, very repetitive; the only major decision you get to make is about which engine you are going to pursue. Cards appearing on the table may necessitate some tactical variation, but the annoying rule that people who worked before now need 'a break' and therefore cannot be used the next turn, makes even this a pointless ordeal. Even more annoying is that this pause was introduced for balance rather than thematic reasons: having a break for one whole day, with a Big Production to be done in a week? Yeah, right. 

The phenomenal artwork gives the impression that more effort was spent here than on making an interesting game; in fact it keeps on telling me that you really don't want to pay attention to these little spaces, numbers, and icons as these are just gamey distractions from what's [i]really[/i] about: artist Neriac showcasing what (s)he's capable of, and desperately in need of more jobs to work on. A sad offering from Ystari.

Thematically this is a game I knew we had to try. Shakespearean characters and you're attempting to put on a great show? Sounds right up our alley.

While the rules are a bit complex to explain, once you get going the rounds move quickly. Like many games of this genre, there's some agony as you realize you can't do everything you want to before the show must go on. The rest tokens are a very good element that makes that tension even more intense.

Beautifully illustrated and works just fine with 2 players. I'm keen to try this again with more players.

Encore un jeu proposé dans la boîte à idée (preuve qu'on vous écoute, hein :) ). C'est le dernier Ystari, donc un jeu plutôt orienté gros joueurs. Le thème est tout à fait original car nous allons diriger une troupe de théâtre. "Jouer ou ne pas jouer, telle est la question". Nous, on se pose pas trop cette question : on va jouer, bien sûr ! Et on va devoir gérer tout ça (car c'est un jeu de gestion !) : commander les costumes, construire les décors, chauffer la salle pour accueillir nos acteurs. Et tout ça, pour Toi, Public !

After the first play, I really enjoyed it. It took a while for some of the rules to sink in but when it did, it all become clear and we all settled into a good game. I thought I would loss because I did do any set building and was missing out on the bonuses. But I won by 3 points because I was the only one to have pick up a Jeweller and pick up the gold tokens that gave me points. 
Really would like to play another game, and look forward to it.

Nice worker placement game. Players try to score points and earn money by creating their own work force consisting of different persons, each with their own specific abilities, and putting them to work. If you cannot pay your work force at the end of the game you lose points. But if you hope to live the theme and bring to live Shakespeare's plays on the stage...look for another game.

Shakespeare is the first game I have played from the 2015 Essen crop, and if this is anything to go by we are in for a good year.  It is a clever and very enjoyable mid-weight Euro with a nice thematic overlay involving putting on a Shakespearean play in the days of the Great Bard.  There are 5 rounds and in each you select actions and maybe take a card (a new employee) to give you more possible actions.  But be warned, at the end of the game you have to pay the salaries of all these staff.  

There are many delicious decisions to be made on every turn and the game shines from start to finish.  

I put it in the same category in terms of complexity and feel as Rokoko, Village, Lancaster, Marco Polo...to me all near-perfect games.

An interesting and unusual theme. The pressure is there to maximize each turn trying to put on the best play. Hiring the best actors, putting them in the best costumes you can, to act in front of the best set pieces. You cant do everything you like, where can your production afford to cut corners. If you allow it, the theme is there. The play time is in our sweet spot. The artwork is very well done. A near perfect light to mid weight Euro for us.

Good eurogame with some interesting mechanics. The theme is a bit uncorrelated but it's ok. Even if I enjoyed my plays, this is game is not in ma top; Don't know why. However you have to at least try it.

RATING: 8
Very well designed, quite tight game. It's easy to focus on recruiting characters for their special abilities and delay worrying about paying their wages/salary. That is, until end game hits, and you have to pay them! The blocking dynamic (rest phase) adds a novel element that fundamentally affects the planning of your strategy and its execution. Will certainly be playing many more times to fully appreciate it...

Fantastic game, I love the innovative theatre theme. Mulling over the many routes to improve your Acts to earn Prestige Points is a mental workout that is very rewarding.

2016-07-29 : This is exactly the kind of intricate medium lever worker-placement game I love - both long term strategic and short term tactical play are required to do well, but the choices are never overwhelming, making this a relatively short, but intense game. An additional note : the theme works very well with the mechanics, which makes it easy to learn/teach the game.
2016-08-01 : A second game confirms the initial impression - another 3-player game that went right to the wire with every point or little advantage mattering a lot

Very tight mechanics but we were turned off by the artistry of the board and cards.  Additionally it seemed too much like other resource gathering games we've played.  The theme was not what we'd envisioned from a game about Shakespeare.  Very cartooney cards.

Fast paces, 6 rounds. Worker placement with a slight bidding mechanic. 

I really like this game. Its fast and medium weight. The points are super scarce, where earning 20 points is likely to win the game. I like the lock out mechanic and the different workers you can use, so everyone has different option. 

The game is very tight with resources being scarce as well as points.

Played this when tired and the omissions in the rule book made it even more confusing, such as not listing where the token is placed on prestige counter or not clarifying if special characters can utilize gold costume or sets. I need to play it more to fully weigh in, but it is a decent game with beautiful art and nice components. MM

[b]Sold 7/9/2017[/b] - a completely fine Euro game with some neat concepts, I bought Shakespeare mostly for the theme, and the gameplay was not varied enough game-to-game to keep me coming back to it.

RATING: 7
Ohhh I really liked this one, not only are you playing against your opponent but you end up playing against your board, as you can only refresh a single action a turn thus you must balance which actions to take and  in which turns, hopefully countering the actions your opponents taken i.e you make costumes whilst they make sets which allows you pick of the costumes etc.

This plays relatively quickly and the action allowance bidding mechanic is quite novel and an interesting first player mechanic. the fewer actions you bid the more likely you are to go first and first player gets a victory point, however you then have fewer actions. 

This plays well with two players but I think this will really shine with 3-4 players as there will be more competition for objectives, actors and for set and costumes.

On the surface this is a pretty simple worker placement game. But it's tightness is what makes it interesting. With scores usually ending under the 20 every point counts. The end-scoring cards can give you a goal to move towards to.

I also like the tableau building part where you can create your own custom collection of actors and stagehands, The theme is well integrated and the art is great. An all-round great game.

Un super jeu de gestion piochant des mechaniques à tous les jeux de gestion. Assez peu d'originalité (ou des originalités médiocres) mais super prenant. Assez joli aussi (bien qu'un peu trop petit). Ca à l'air plutot bien equilibré au final.

Une partie décevante avec un leger déséquilibre (Titania) et pas mal de randomness.

Backstage (l'extension) dénature complètement le jeu. Le faisaint passer de catégorie moyen à lourd. Mais à coté de cela elle enlève le défaut concernant les mises trop évidentes. Une extension interessante mais problématique car le jeu sans apparaitra fade et déséquilibré mais le jeu avec difficilement accessible.

Shakespeare is a game true to the Ystari tradition: a mishmash of lots of different little mechanical tweaks combined in a single, integrated package. The different parts feel like they belong, not independent subgames like is often the case when this is done.

Shakespeare is perhaps a little heavier than usual for Ystari's Euro game catalog to date. Possibly owing to that it is also a fairly conservative design. Well-developed and challenging, yes; ground-breaking, no.

Brettspiel zu den Brettern, die die Welt bedeuten: Dem musischen Thema entgegengesetzt präsentiert sich SHAKESPEARE als knallharter Abnutzungskampf um jeden Zentimeter Boden. Punkt um Punkt fightet man sich im Schneckentempo vorwärts auf der Minimen-Ausgabe einer Kramerleiste in einer klassischen Euroabstraktion zwischen konservativem Optimierungs-Worker-Placement und konkurrenzhafter Unerbittlichkeit. Das Spielgefühl lässt nicht viel Raum für Bewegung und Hüpfereien innerhalb dieser bretthart gebauten Bühne. Im direkten Vergleich zum thematisch ebenfalls künstlerischen Jahrgangsverwandten GRAND AUSTRIA HOTEL mutet letzeres an wie ein leichtfüssiges Tänzchen auf dem Wiener Opernball. In meinem persönlichen Spieltheater kommt SHAKESPEARE trotz solidem Bau nicht wirklich am Holzpfosten einer der BGG 6/10 vorbei.

Some of the worst instructions I've seen in a long time. I recommend you watch both the Rahdo and Dice Tower reviews before reading the instructions. A very beautiful art style and strong theming. This is a very, very tight competitive worker placement game - you'll win by one point and one mistake can eliminate you from contention. Plays well with two players running under an hour.

Bidding, worker placement, engine building. It's all about timing and putting on a great show. Worker placement with your private area for your own theatre company. Compete for gathering costumes, building your stage and writing 3 acts for the play (victory points and money) and labor force to improve your company but if you get too large of a labor force and can't pay them at the end of the game you lose victory points and this is a low scoring game so it really hurts. Good fun gets a +1 for theme.

It's a well made game with standard worker placement except for the quirk of blind bidding the amount of workers and temporarily expending your worker placement spots. They're interesting quirks, I just don't like them. I'm really bad at blind bidding and losing your worker placements spots, even temporarily, feels bad. I don't feel like I'm building up to anything during the game, I feel like the game is continually beating me down and I'm slightly beating it back.

Looks like a worker-placement efficiency game but is mostly timing and drafting; when do you pass a turn to get a new card? when do you push a given actor to work two days in a row? which costumes do you try to complete fast enough to score their bonus twice?

I found it hard to care about the hoops we were jumping through, though. Ambience was a grind. The requirement for stage symmetry mostly meant "don't bother with scenery unless you're up for a big commitment". Same with the golden tiles.

Just another solid euro, and the theme felt pasted on to me. I've yet to play an Ystari game that felt special.

This is a very fun game that plays well between 2 and 4 players. There are a lot of concepts to teach, which can be daunting for new players. However, it's a totally underutilized theme that appeals to certain types, and the gameplay is a very interesting worker placement with a little bit less "meanness" than other worker placement games.

Very impressed by this game. Lighter side of mid-weight, easy to digest rules, with a good mix of strategy and tactics. Random draw of cards and sets/costumes means great replayability. The solo and multiplayer rules are both fun, even with a "beat your score" solo game.
I tend to enjoy games that do something different with worker placement. This game isn't worker-placement per se, but has that feel. Instead of fighting over places to put your workers, you are fighting for the limited resources that your workers can provide. Highly recommend this one.

A rare Euro where the theme comes through pretty darned well. It's a tight game in terms of rounds and number of actions you can take but it leaves you lots of choices and chances to plan (e.g., the 'resting' mechanic where you have to pick who is off limits the next round is very well implemented). Almost never turn this one down when it's up for being played.

This is a game about Elizabethan theatre and the boards depict a proscenium stage instead of a thrust stage? Actual physical scenery is important, instead of word scenery?

Dull, been there, done that game.  If you don't have any worker placement game yet it might be the game you are looking for, which is... unlikely to say the least.  In the Ystari line up, there is certainly much to say about the graphic design of this one as it is a serious step up.

Quite heavy (at least for my first play-through). Lots of tough decisions and elements that interact - maybe a tad too many, leading to a bit of AP. I particularly like the devious most-of-my-last-used-people-must-rest-now mechanic. The interaction on the Play Parts tracks was also interesting, although I found it perhaps a bit too convoluted for what it was. I'll need to play more to know if this is a hit or a miss.

Gana el que mas puntos obtenga.

Gran juego!!

Wow, very fresh and original design. 
No, it cannot be compared to any other game.

I'm impressed both by the mechanics and by the game being so thematic.

Shakespeare proves that eurogame does not have to be a synonim of a dry, utterly boring and arbitrary design of Feldian style.

Seems like another winner from Ystari.

EDIT: The replayability might be an issue in the long run.  BUT - the 'Backstage' expansion solves this problem wonderfully.  Buy it!!!

Pretty solid worker placement game.  The actions grow as you recruit workers and actors.  I like how you have to choose which person to rest each round that you won't be able to use in the next.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (December 2015)

As is usual from me, when I bought the game I didn’t know a thing about it :D, but Shakespeare turned out to be a decent to good euro game.

The theme is boring to me, but it is pasted on anyway. You don’t feel it through the game. The rules are pretty easy, you can explain the game under 12 minutes and with 3 players the game flows very quickly.

The art of the game is very good, the components are ok.

You need to bid each turn for turn order and if you bid too much you decrease the number of actions. I love this balancing mechanism, it makes the game a lot harder and I think it the best feature of the game, without it, Shakespeare would be a mediocre game. The actions aren’t obvious in any way (which card to take, which card to activate, which dresses to get, which theater part to get) and there are ways to hurt your opponents (a very weird thing to have in an euro game). The other part I really enjoy it having to decide which card will be available in the next round (you can only choose one), adding this was a stroke of brilliance because it makes the game much better. It also allows for some strategic plan to form and you have to carefully plan your timing to get those elusive VPs.

Bottom line, Shakespeare is a light-medium weight euro game. It features interesting/though decisions and very good art. As it stands, it is a borderline  7.0 to me, but for now I will keep it in my game collection. I want to play it again soon.

2016-04-10 - I've only played this once, but I found it to be a pretty interesting and thematic tableau building game. I mean, it's not really like putting on a play, but it's probably as close as you're likely to get in a board game. The card drafting is interesting, and managing all of the different aspects of the production is seriously challenging. This is a good game.

I want this game to hit the table more than it does. Great art and theme. Auction mechanic works really well with the rest of the gameplay.

Tentative ranking after about 8-10 plays thus far.  At the time of this writing, it's probably my favorite of the Essen 2015 crop.  Fairly straightforward in terms of rules and mechanics.

Not sure about replay value, my guess is that you will see a bunch of expansions offering additional Character cards (like the Prospero Essen promo card).

[floatleft][ImageID=2583214][/floatleft]The game is exceedingly straightforward. Each round begins with a wager phase in which you blind bid 1-5 action discs. The person who bids the least discs goes first and gains a precious VP (end game scores are around 20VP). The other players slot behind this player in order of least discs bid. The number of discs will determine how many actions you can do that round. Actions involve placing a disc on a character you control to receive their bonus. However, at the end of the round you must rest all but one character you used. So if you use a lot of discs you will rest a lot of characters as well.

There are two special rounds in the game, rounds 4 and 6, which have dress rehearsal scoring. The three central tracks of the board are scored in those rounds, giving players some money (used to pay characters at the end of the game) or points. A lot of the bonuses you get during the game advance you on one or more of these tracks. However, only one of these tracks is a race with the other players, the other two tracks have thresholds to pass in order to receive a reward, but the relative positions of players is irrelevant. 

[center][ImageID=2583220 medium][/center]

There are two decisions in the the game which I enjoy. The decision of what to wager, which involves a bit of speculation, a bit of planning and a bit of weighing the pros and cons of various scenarios. It's also one of the rare examples of blind bidding done right. The other decision I enjoy is who not to rest at the end of the round, it isn't always clear what the best choice is and noodling that out can be fun, rewarding, and at times painful. The rest of the game is full of more or less obvious decisions that left me bored. There is a severe lack of tension in the game, many actions do not interact with the other players at all. Whatever excitement can be derived from the few that do is largely gone after the first round of actions have been taken.

There just isn't enough that I enjoy to make up for what I dislike. If the game played in 30 minutes I think I'd be happy with it, but at 90 minutes with 4p, no thanks! Perhaps at 2p I would be more satisfied, but I own many exemplary 2p games that don't see the table often enough.

A WP game where you build your own action-selection board. Rather than interacting through which actions are available, you are interacting through the resources which can be obtained through them. I also love how the game offers you multiple paths to victory, and you have to choose one and a half, as "maxing" one path leaves you with leftover actions.

I also feel like Backstage, the first expansion, greatly helps this one.

This game gives me a warm feeling in my heart. I secretly love playing dress up in Shakespeare . The theme is not usually attractive to me, but this game does it with flare. The art is wonderful. It's competitive while being rather easy to understand. Games are tense with a whimsy I can't describe. Good times.

The artwork and theme of this game is amazing. You really feel like you are trying to rush costumes and set pieces to a play, trying to write the play and gathering money to pay the actors and designers. Rounds start with a closed bid which determines who will go first and how many actions does each player take and you also recruit a character each day. So each turn your number of actions you can take gets larger but the number of actions you can take does not change much. Each actors actions is unique and there is end game scoring cards to add some surprises to the end game. I really like this game and can't wait to play it more.

• Thematically every player runs a theater, hires actors, does rehearsals and tries to make best show. 
• Mechanically it has blind bidding as main part of the game which will give point every turn for best bidder, as well as determine number of action player has in that round.
Combined with the fact that used characters in one round can't be used in next round, low scores and need to pay characters at the end of the game (while money is tight) makes choices in the game even more important. 
On top of that it looks great.

Ez a darab valahogy eltűnt a tömegével érkező játékok sűrűjében, pedig egy korrekt kis euróról van szó, ami több szeretetet érdemelne.

A tematika és a mechanika kapcsolata ugyan nem túl szoros, de erre keveset fogunk gondolni a körünk tervezgetése közben, különösen a körsorrendre való licit során, amikor egy-egy plusz akció beválallásán/elengedésén súlyos pontok múlhatnak. És 1-1 pontnak hatalmas jelentősége van, mivel a végeredmény játékosszámtól függően valahol 20-30 pont között alakul majd, sőt a holtverseny sem ritka.

A különböző színészek és mesteremberek képességeiből érdekes kis kombókat lehet összehozni, de közben a többiekre is figyelni kell, mert nagyon gyorsan elfogyhatnak az értékes ruhák és színpadi díszítések a közös piacról és akkor bizony bajban leszünk. Többféle út is vezethet a győzelemhez és nem feltétlenül a legértékesebb karakterekkel lehet a legmesszebb jutni.

Tetszetős mechanikák:
 - az adott körben használt akcióidból a következőben csak egyet tudsz majd újra használni (lusták ezek a színházi népek na...)
 - ha elől akarsz lenni a körsorrendben, hogy tiéd legyenek az értékes karakterek/"nyersanyagok", akkor bizony kevesebb akciód lesz, mint a többieknek

2, 3 és 4 fővel is jól működött.

Mindent egybevetve ez egy szép és agyalós játék, ajánlott.

Surprisingly good looking Ystari-game. Theme is great, but unfortunately it is just pasted on. Very abstract game, which offers some interesting decisions to be made. Something is still missing here, which why this doesn't deserve any better rating - one thing is the "abstract feel" and the other might be the fact, that every single tile comes into the play - more of random would have been better solution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.1
It's a new Ystari game so maybe it's not surprising it's practically a standard complex Euro, with two things going for it: one is a short playtime (around one hour), and the other one is a relatively strong feel of theme for an Euro (so you are still just pushing the cubes - okay, tokens and markers - here). It even feels like the game might be more perfect mechanism-wise than Grand Austria Hotel in the same year. It's quite enjoyable for an Euro (with quite a tactical nature), even if - once again - nothing really new or exceptional.

Art is nice and the game play is solid but I just didn't find the spark in the game to keep me overly interested.

This is an interesting one! If you are a thespian i any way you will certainly enjoy the many references to the most famous Shakespeare plays. 
The game itself is an action selection/action management game. It's not wholly unique, but it does great new things with familiar mechanisms. The theme comes through very well, and every action is tense. Give this one a shot!

This is a very tight euro with some excellent production values. The theme, that of putting on a play, is unusual and I love that. It took me a few games to remember the flow and what each of the symbols in the game meant (there is practically no text anywhere in the game outside the rules) and if you make errors early it can really cost you (scores are very low). I really enjoy it but not many people will play with me!

It's worker placement, bidding for turn order, some tracks thrown in for a little bit of a race with other players. Nothing new here. Player interaction mostly comes from acquiring stuff from common pools with limited resources. All in all a solid game, but it is also a severe case of JASE (just another soulless Euro). It's dry, very mechanical as we know from Ystari games. There isn't much wrong with the game, but the whole package doesn't excite me. And thematically: you can win without having any actors. Or you can win without having any decor pieces. A scramble for a few points here and there. Far from a great game, but willing to play again occasionally.

Super fiddly Euro with a very fun theme. I like the idea of building a play and hiring actors, making sets and costumes to score points. The game though seems unbalanced and favors the gold items too much, as points are too scarce in this game and the yellow items offer easy points.  I wish it also let you create the script/opening acts etc for the play to make it more fun, but no such luck. That would be too much of a thematic ameritrash story than a Euro, I guess.

It's an OK game for me - the concepts are not that innovative, the advancements tracks for example remind me of Medieval Academy and the game is on the longer end. Game scores are also quite low, with not that much rewards given in VPs for your hard work. Not bad but expected more.

It's a simple and it can be fast game with some good hard choices to be made.

The Initiative order every round and the Auction Bidding that influences turn order are great and very important.
Everything seems to be well balanced so you can win with a strategy of Artisans or Actors.
The Queen goals seemed a bit week but in a game where you score 20 points getting 1 to 4 points with 2 Queen cards is important!

Also, the art of the game is amazing!

A tight and elegant euro, coupled with a very interesting theme. The game mechanics are so intuitive as it is merged with the theme very well.

Plays well enough, though once you've taken the theme away, the game is a very uninspired experience. Everyone is trying to do the same things (Make costumes, stage designs, recruit workers, etc.), but not everything is created equal.

I dislike that some queen cards can be nearly strictly better than other actions but it depends on draws, then I don't like the blind bid system since you may not always be rewarded for your efforts.

Shakespeare was one of the Essen releases I was interested in. I had seen rahdo's Run Trough and I knew it was my kind of game. Julián ordered it first, and I diverted my attention to other games until we received it and [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/play/details/16384316]played it with Rebeca and Ángel at Rebeca's on Oct 31th.[/url]

It's a worker placement card drafting economic game with many additional minor elements: hidden bids, tile placement, etc. No new revolutionary mechanisms, but it combines them to form a seamless splendid machine, a very solid medium euro.

The components are nice, and the art is very good, evocative of that time, but the theme stops there: it is a euro that uses abstract mechanisms.

It presents you with real decisions each turn, decisions that have consequences. It's one of those games where each action uses to have secondary benefits, and you need to combine these actions in the most efficient way. The points are scarce and not easy to win, that makes each time you gain one a victory. It also does very well at building tension. Materials are scarce, especially during the last turns and the competition is fierce!

My only real issue with Shakespeare is the gold: IMHO, it is vastly overpowered. It gives way too many points. Especially if only one or two players have jewelers. 

Overall, its a very good game. It only lacks the "mojo", that "special thing" that makes you wanting to come for more over and over.

Surprisingly, an Ystari game that does not make your eyes bleed. Unfortunately, that is pretty much all of the positive things to say about this.

First, the rulebook is quite a mess: Full of implicit declarations, very little emphasis on consistency of terminology, and severely lacking in clarifying images. When compared to for example the excellence of Discoveries, it seems apparent that the Powers That Be at Asmodee really do not care at all what the studios under their umbrella are doing.

Second, the gameplay is just the usual bunch of unconnected, unthematic building blocks thrown together that Ystari habitually does, without forgetting to include some annoying take that elements. Collect some random counters, move on some random tracks, and occasionally punch your friends in the face. There are some interesting decisions to make but not enough to counteract all the flaws.

Piacevole scoperta. Gioco semplice ma comunque strategico, non molte regole, probabilmente non tantissime strategie ma un gioco che si lascia giocare volentieri.

Gioco veramente carino ma non aspettatevi profondità infinita e troppa varietà.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 8)[/COLOR]

[i]I remember really enjoying my one play, but wondered whether the game would appeal to my family. I really want to play this again, maybe with my family at TotalCon. I also remember loving the art and aesthetic of the game, definitely one that is back on my radar. This is why I really appreciate this list, games can fall through the cracks and this list helps me remember games I really enjoyed and wanted to play again.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Amazing art, this game is beautiful which is quite fitting considering the theme.
- Multiple paths to victory which all add their own mechanics to the game play.
- A solid next step family game, the theme would really help sell this one and the mechanics are well tied to the theme.
- Bidding for number of actions and player order is an agonizing decision every round, but extremely fun to puzzle out.
- Great depth to playtime ratio, I played a 4p game and two of us were learning and it still wrapped up in 90 minutes.

I know it was only one play, but I really had fun playing this game and can't wait to play again. An excellent example of a designer taking a bunch of different mechanics and blending them into a very elegant game. [/i]

Okay game, but not worth owning. Points are so tight it feels like something is missing. Now, i don't enjoy salad games that have final scores of 265 pts, but 11 seems a bit ridiculous. It's weak as a two player. Progressing on the three act tracks feels very bland. Not much tension. Too much randomnees in what comes out of the bag each round. The incentive order track is confusing, makes no thematic sense and going first is a huge advantage. It's very hard to build the pyramid in the theatre and takes a lot of investment, for what? Yay! Two points! The expansion deck adds characters and ways to use the discarded chits but also adds another hour play time and too much ap for such a light game. Now, you get pts for putting a hat on a character. How exciting. Played twice, once stock, once with expansion, and sold.

After first play. Haven't really decided yet what I think. I usually like euro style worker placement games a lot, but I don't like "narrow" games where you stack the bottlenecks upon each other, like this. After scoring it also feels like this is a game which often will be decided by tiebreaker and there will be only a few points between winner and looser, which I also don't like. I do like the action-auction mechanics though.

Shakespeare is a worker placement game in which you acquire actors and theater employees to give you more private action spaces, and use those actions to collect costumes and set pieces, advance on three tracks which provide bonuses at certain thresholds, and get money to pay your actors/employees at the end of the game. Players actually bid giving up actions for turn order, and action spaces that were used in one turn cannot be used in the next turn (except one of the player's choice). The tracks don't provide a continuous benefit, and instead are only scored twice during the game. The game flow is fine, and there are lots of different paths to victory, but I found the scoring just wasn't granular enough. It was just too much effort to get single points, and toward the end of the game, it's frustrating when a ton of effort doesn't even yield a single point.

I got to play this game at my local meetup yesterday. It was pretty fun. I helped a guy who owns the game out by sitting through the rule book (he never played it but owns it) together and play.

This is just about the right weight for me in terms of complexity. It does offer tough choices throughout the game by using a debt mechanism. The rest of the game is a mix bag of simultaneous auction/action selection/worker placement/racing on stats on different tracks.

The theme is pasted on like a standard euro game but the money is tight part is kind of fitting for the theme because we are struggling young artists trying to make a name for ourselves in the world etc. 

It's a game I would be glad to play again.

++ The game itself. I love this kind of (semi-)heavy games where you wanna do X actions, but can only do X-2. 
++Very beautiful artwork
- the number of characters and secret objectives is rather low. I always like some variety, even if that means that not all the cards will come into play.
- The game is susceptible for AP

Quite a lot going on in this midweight euro-style game. It's not really about the plays, though. More about managing the general productions (the plays themselves are abstracted to 3 simple tracks). At it's core, this is really more of a worker management game. Kind of feels like an economic games, but I'm not sure that's quite accurate. With more players there starts to be quite a lot to keep track of.

Colorful with fun mechanics. I really enjoyed this one. I would happily play this one again. The first group I played with didn't like it but the second time I played it - it got some love. Really cool bidding mechanic for turn order and fun use of actions. I actually thought it was innovative enough to be different. Apparently the theme didn't mesh with the mechanics which is why it didn't go over well in the first game. I would happily play this again- given the opportunity.

A Globe színház éled újjá ebben a játékban, ahol belebújhatunk Shakespeare bőrébe és a színházat "menedzselhetjük", darabokat vihetünk színpadra és a végén jó esetben bezsebelhetjük a tapsot.
Azt tesszük, ami egy jó színházigazgatóhoz illik, azaz, felvehetünk színészeket (minél nagyobb sztár, annál többe kerül, viszont annál inkább borítékolható, hogy sikerre fogja vinni a darabot), díszletezőt, öltöztetőt, segédet, aranymívest stb.
Egy hét alatt kell a legtöbbet kihoznunk a társulatunkból és azután hogy legördült a függöny, ki kell fizetnünk az alkalmazottakat! Ugyanis ebben a játékban nem akkor kell fizetni, amikor felveszed az illetőt, hanem úgy, ahogy a való életben van, azaz az elvégzett munkája után.

This is a really solid euro game where players hire actors, make costumes and design sets in preparation for putting on a play. The game is very tight. Every action and every point counts. The turn order mechanism rewards players for doing less, which is an interesting cost/beneif analysis. With one exception, action spots only refresh every other turn, so managing your actions is a fun mini game as well. I enjoyed playing this game immensely, but after playing, I don't feel anxious for a second play. If someone were to bring it by and want to play it I'd be happy to, but a lot of times after playing a game like this I'm anxoious to take another crack at it, but here I don't feel that same pressure. I think it's because you sort of see everything the game does in a single play. You see all the tokens, and all the cards. The order in which those cards come out will give the game some replayability, but there's maybe not quite enough going on in the end to warrant my taking this up to 5 or 10 plays? Maybe my affection will grow and I'll be proven wrong. Session 1 proved that it's certainly an excellent game.

I like the idea of hiring and activating my workers while designing costumes and building sets. My main problem with the game is that it just drags. It seems to take way too much work to earn a single point, and it never felt like I had made a smart play, but rather initiative allowed me to get to the obvious Play before all of the other players. 

Overall, the theme manages to shine through the drudgery, and I can actually enjoy some individual mechanics of the game, but in the end it's hard to feel like I've accomplished anything in Shakespeare.

This game has one of those "I can't do it all" vibes (like Caverna).  You must decide what subset of actions available are the best right now.  As a result, this game is going to be advantageous to those who have already played the game.

The game plays very differently with 2 or 4 players.  The more players the tighter the game.  If you don't like worker placement games that make you feel action starved, you may not like this game.  If you have 100 things you feel like you need to do by the end of the game, you'll be lucky if you can complete 70 of those - most of the time it'll be closer to 55 - 60.  So, you'll feel between 30% - 45% action starved.  For this reason I don't think it's for everyone.

(+) Intuitive, structured, easy to understand rule set

(+) Much interesting decision making in a game of a very reasonable length (little over 90 min for 4 players)

(+) Some original mechanisms: bidding with action points in order to determine player order, each turn you can only re-use one action card, ... In a whole, the game system works well and offers players plenty of meaningful decisions to make. It seems that the engine building systems incorporated into this game offers players different paths to victory, with certain paths getting favored according to the order certain action cards come out of the game (so: no multiple paths to victory with little risk of dominant strategies).

(+) Game is pretty tense: there is a shortage of literally everything and prioritizing and assessing what other players are about to do is very important to be successful.

(+) The mechanisms are thematically grounded: with a little imagination you can think of yourself organizing a grand play in too little time, recruiting actions, writing scripts, building stages, designing costumes or rehearsing.

(-) The game tends to grow rather chaotic after a few rounds: each player collects an increasing number of action cards, and it is hard to keep track what the abilities of every player are after a while. Yet, this is important in order to try to figure out what your own priorities should be. This can be cause for analysis paralysis and could grind the game pace down significantly during the second half of the game. Moreover, all those extra cards offer more opportunities for everybody to collect items, but this growth does not get reflected into more resources becoming available each round. This creates a certain level of chaos with 'empty markets' and useless action cards, probably overpowering player order. For me, unfortunately this is a kind of a deal breaker.

(-) In this game very few points are scored: if you manage to score net 20 points during the game, you stand a reasonable chance of winning. Every point counts, but  in the end the player doesn't really feel rewarded for implementing a superior strategy netting '3 points more'. I like a little more differentiation in my games :)

[u]Tips:[/u]
(*) A winning strategy is one in which players plan a course of action early on, keeping in mind which action cards become available during the first two rounds. Build your engine and stick to your plan.
(*) If powerful costume designers come out early, snatching them away and designing impressive costumes (at least worth 13 costume points) should generate many points (3 points for an impressive costume is significant in this game!)
(*) Turn order is important in order to have some control over events in this game: focus on the most critical actions and try to be early in turn order.

Good base game, excellent with expansion. The directions of the base game were confusing at times. The first time my sister and I played the game, we spent a lot of time debating the meaning of the directions. It was many weeks before we tried a second play though, and again we were confused about some of the direction. But the third time was the charm. Once we finally figured out the proper way to play, we fell in love with the game. After 19 plays, I can say the game ages like a fine wine. With the addition of the Backstage Expansion, this game really shines. Every move, every discison is important. The tension remains the whole game. How many should you bid? How many actors should you hire? Can you afford to pay everyone? Who should get a costume?

I think that Shakespeare tricks you into thinking you are making meaningful decisions. I really feel like I am, when playing. And so I suppose you could argue that the illusion--since successful--IS successful.

But after repeated sessions where we all sat down for 90 minutes and Did Stuff, and when it was all over, the final scores were invariably 23-22-22-20...I simply can't help but wonder whether I've been "had"...

Release your inner bard. The connection with Shakespeare is tenuous and it could easily be rethemed. But the mechanics are solid and it plays quickly for how many actions you can take. Enough ways to get VPs without turning into a point salad. Needs more actor cards but that's what expansions are for, I guess.

A euro with a different and interesting theme. The mechanics don't feel too much like the theme (yeah you're hiring people, getting costumes, building a stage, and rehearsing, but it doesn't feel too much more than bumping up spaces on a track to get better scores). That being said, it's an entertaining and satisfying game, with beautiful artwork.

Played twice with 3P. The highlight in the otherwise lackluster Shakespeare is the [thing=97842][/thing]-esque bid for turn order, which requires players to work with fewer actions if they want to take their turn earlier. The rest of the production feels a lot less inspired as players are relegated to hiring characters, dressing them up and constructing a pyramid-like structure which apparently passes off as a stage.

A few quibbles creep up as the game progresses; particularly the unintuitive method of deciding turn initiative, as well as the thematic quirk of having multiple clones of Shakespeare and the Queen herself running around. A second go at this game proved to be more pleasant, but also reinforced its mediocrity. It's a shame too, as the artwork is near phenomenal. As the great playwright himself would have put it – all that glisters is not gold.

A lot meatier than most games I would buy. But as wifey is a huge Shakey fan, I took a punt.

Despite the many phases, routes to gain VP and admin work needed in each turn, wifey soon the hang of it (mainly I beleive due to easy to understand iconography on the cards) and actually really liked the 2P dual off.

Love the bidding phase where betting the least gives you 1st go in each round (and a Victory point), but leaves you with less actions per round.

Also love the set design rules where colour symatry is needed along with the bonuses for getting certain colours.

It's also a game where you have to really keep your eye on spending, as you start with no cash, but at the end have to pay all your actors and craftsmen for their work. Although again as with gaining VPs, there are several ways to get cash as well.

If there is any slight niggles, it would be that in nearly every round, we forget to update the initiative track after the 1st player uses an actor. Which is quite an important aspect of the game in breaking ties in the bidding phase.

With a 2P game taking around 45 mins, compared to the 4P game I recently played which nearly topped 2 hours... it will mainly be used as a head to head battle with wifey.

A solid Ystari title, as you might expect. The game is very tight, and each victory point will be well-earned. There is a quality point salad here: you can build up your sets, your actors are worth points as long as you can afford them in the end, and then you have cool endgame goals that you're working toward as well. Combine that with having to acquire the various characters that help you acquire the various points, and you've got a fun, interesting game with plenty of sweet decisions.

It is a tense game where you have a limited amount of workers to do the actions you want and most of the time you are grinding you teeth about what to choice!

Gameplay is smooth and easy and all the different mechanics are fun to use, like using little tiles of different colour to build your set - How awesome of a contribution to the theme is that!

Another year, another Ystari point salad. I suppose I should be glad it isn't called Shakyspeare.

Players are attempting to "put on a play", i.e. advancing on three script tracks, acquiring costumes for the actors, dressing the set and maintaining a good level of ambience in the theatre. The queen can provide either end-game scoring cards or funds, important as any unpaid workers at the end of the game are worth negative points.

It's often possible to look at a game and determine whether it was built around a particular theme or around a certain mechanism, but I'm not sure with this one: the theme comes through so poorly that I can't credit its genesis there; neither does it offer any mechanical novelty. The bidding for turn order (and tiebreaker) works very well but the rest of the game is not worthy of it.

This is the kind of perfectly functional optimization puzzle I would normally rate higher than this, but it's such a low scoring game (the rulebook suggests a winning score with four players is 22) that the random elements are unusually frustrating. The "do what other players aren't" maxim applies, but minor quirks of the card mix, set/costume distribution and queen card order can easily add up to a few points here or there, and that is enough.

The artwork by Neriac is lovely.

I like the mechanic of bidding your actions with fewer bids going earlier in the turn.  That's about all I liked.  Most of the things you do aren't interesting.  Building scenery and putting together costumes could be interesting, but it isn't.  You'd think that if Hamlet, Puck, Lady Macbeth, etc. were characters in the game, you'd have some idea of what they did.  You'd be wrong.  They are there in name and picture only, because the theme is only barely integrated into the thoroughly mediocre worker placement gameplay.

Pro: Asymmetrical actions. hidden bonus actions. Various roles ensure replayability. Resources are spent across turns (make for light strategy).
Against: Theme doesn't grab me. Multiplayer solitaire. Upkeep mechanism makes for bookkeeping.

In the end, it is all about whether you (still) like euro-games or not. If you do, you probably are not bothered by the multiplayer solitaire feeling, in fact this might be a pro for you. The theme didn't grab me, but if you're interested in that as well AND in euro's, I can see why this game might rate very high for you.

As it stands, my gaming group will NEVER be coaxed by the theme and we're not that eager for another euro. So this will not get playtime with my game group. Also, it is too deep for a family game so there is no reason for me to get this. Pass.

RATING: 7.3
tl;dr: enjoyable Euro

Worker placement, engine building, nice artwork, what's not to love? Not much to be fair. This game is very well designed and developed. It is approachable with nice meaningful choices and a nicely flowing game play.
In fact I don't really have anything negative to say about this game. I liked mostly everything about it, so the only thing missing is that I didn't love any of it. But if not loving but simply liking everything is the worst you can say about a game, you have a decent game :)

Fairly bland worker placement with some not very exciting (Queen based) objectives. I suspect that there is slightly more to this game than I saw in my first play, but I really doubt I'll be excited about it enough to investigate it much more. 

Shakespeare is a perfectly solid, if deeply uninspired, worker placement game with a bidding mechanism that feels as though it needs something more to make it shine.

I would have probably loved this two years ago.

The more person you wpuld like to use in one round, the more actions you will take, but you will act later in a round. Fewer actions and you could do something sooner.
Every person exept one is blocked for the next round.

All this should be a really interesting euro game, but it only another common euro.

You know, I really wish they would design rules differently, somehow.  For some reason this is a fairly smooth game, but the rules make it seem far more complicated than it need be.  I thinks it's a brilliant design.  As said, very smooth, but very difficult decisions around every corner.  This is not for the AP prone or slow thinker.  My wife loves the theme and artwork, but because of her slow decision-making processes, decided she needs more plays to decide if she likes it because it takes too long.  :(  Anyway,  brilliant euro game deserving of accolades.

This is how you do a heavy euro. No need for tons of confusing mechanisms and unintuitive rules just to make the game feel heavier. You've got a fairly simple game system where every decision requires serious consideration because of the long-term implications. The game has a familiar worker placement feel to it, but there are a few twists that make it stand out.

First is the bid for turn order. You do a blind bid using your "workers," and whoever bids the fewest gets to go first. Of course, they'll have fewer actions for the round.

There's also an element where you have to choose several of your action spaces to "rest" after each round, meaning you can't use the same actions every round. This means you've got to carefully plan out which actions to use this round as well as the next round. This element also makes the blind bid more interesting because each round different people will usually need a different number of workers. If someone has a big round where they take all five actions, then the next round most of their spaces will be resting so they won't need as many workers.

I'll need more plays, but so far I don't have any real negatives to say about this game. It's not one that I will want to play all the time because of the amount of thought that is required.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
As is the case with most blind bidding games, this one isn't good with 2. The bidding, along with jockeying for initiative and position on the tracks, are huge parts of this game that would be lost (or at least severely lessened) with just two players. The game is best with 4 but I could see it working with 3.

Fast, medium weight euro.

Balanced and tense with just the right amount of randomness. 

Event though there are 2-3 paths to victory, I can see the game becoming quite 'samey'. This is not something you feel during the game itself(since it's quite tense), but it dose mean it's not going to hit the table that often.

Shakespeare is a game about putting on a play. You'll be gathering set pieces, costumes, actors and writing plays. Every round you participate in a blind bid, offering up how many of your five markers you will use for the round. The person who bids fewest goes first and gets a point (which is significant as the game is fairly low scoring). Ties are broken in the order you used your first actor (who generally give you a less urgent action) in the previous round. Additionally, only one of the workers you use this round will be available in the next round. In addition to the action markers you will place in a round, you can hire one person each round.

The game is an eight round game. There's two dress rehearsals (in rounds 6 and 8) at which point you're docked points if you haven't advanced far enough on the "writing the play" tracks. However, there are bonuses to be won if you've advanced far enough on those. And if you've costumed your actors then they'll perform and give you some bonus. But if the costumes are nicer you'll get bonus points. So there's a dynamic tension between wanting cheap costumes (so they can perform) and wanting expensive costumes (to get a bonus). There is a similar tension in gathering set pieces, as you can get bonus points if you build up your sets high enough, but if you buy fewer, more expensive, sets, they give you some perks.

Every round there's a chance to improve your troupe's morale, but other players might take actions that make your troupe sadder. There are bonuses awarded and penalties levied depending on how the morale stands at round end.

This is a game where it feels like you don't have nearly enough time and there's always too much to do. There's a lot to think about and much of it seemed opaque on the first play. I didn't figure out what was important until near the end of the game, and struggled the entire game (despite inadvertently cheating half the game). I went cheap on everything and didn't devote enough time to writing my play, which put me firmly in last place (although, with the exception of the winner who had played several times before, the rest of us were very closely grouped).

I'm hoping that this game comes together a little more for me next time. It seems like the type of thing I could really enjoy, if I ever manage to get my head around how to play well. I'm looking forward to more plays.

A euro game that oozes theme? That's different, right? The mechanics are also very sound. Turn order is extremely important. There isn't a lot of direct interaction, but the drafting of costumes, set pieces, and actors makes the decision to go first (or last) very strategic from round to round.

Impressively bland, both thematically and mechanically; very little to enjoy here.

Building sets isn't interesting, creating costumes isn't interesting, the bonus cards aren't interesting, the tracks aren't interesting.  The concept of bidding the number of actions you'll take is reasonably unique and clever, but that's about the only worthwhile aspect - and without anything else for that mechanic to build upon it falls flat.

The game functions, there are actual decisions to be made, but it's largely bereft of fun.

Beautiful artwork and smooth play.
Each turn you get at most 5 actions and the player who performs the less actions becomes 1st player.

I played Shakespeare after I'd had my fall-out with Euro games, and, well, you can guess the rest.

If you're into the theme, you can probably rationalise climbing three tracks a lot better than I can or am willing to. It's one of those abstractions that's just one step too many removed from what it's supposed to represent - you don't actually ever *perform*, you do everything beforehand and see where you fall at the scoring stage.

To be sold.

Great theme, great artwork. Biddling with your workers to determine position vs number of actions is good. Very simple to play and it could possibly bea gateway game but for the fact there are quite a lot of rules to diseminate.  If rated on purely playing the game I would give it 9 but I do wonder how many times I will play it before I feel the tshirt has worn thin.  Expanadble - audience, ticket price, critics?? would increase the replayability perhaps.

I think that Ystari and I have diverged in our game tastes.  Shakespeare is a tightly designed, excellent Eurogame . . . with some bit of soul or character missing.  It somehow feels too mechanical, too themeless, and too dry to really be a compelling part of my collection.

I'd gladly play it again, but it won't be staying in the collection.

After my first complete game (btw, a victory) I feel I can raise the rating a bit.
Shakespeare is quite smart, flows well and allows different paths to victory, with the final scores pretty closed.
I still doubt it has a lot of replayability, it is a bit clunky during the game with all the buttons and little tiles. The board should have been larger or better organized.
Anyways, a nice experience.
Nice art.

I am not sure I have the right to give a rating to this game as i just played only 2 out of 6 turns, the final ones. It seems quite a usual game with not much innovation but since it works, i can't give it a bad rating now. i hope to try it again soon

The theme was pretty strong in this interesting game. Solid mechanics and a lot of options and roads to the goal. What brings the rating down a bit was the hugh importance of certain actions that was game changing, and the ordinary, solitaire, moves that had to be made too. Too much focus (for me at least) was on the turn order.

Deceptively deep gameplay and the fact it plays relatively quickly makes this a great game for me. The artwork is stellar, the theme is interesting and virtually every decision from the bidding to activating cards is wonderfully agonising. My only issue is with the fiddly costume tokens but its a minor gripe given how good everything else is. Can't wait for the expansion.

RATING: 7.5
Action selection game about producing a Shakespeare play.  Recruit actors and stagehands and costumers.  Use a quirky action mechanic to activate them.  Score points.

The cards depicting famous Shakespeare characters are gorgeous, and I suspect the game must be even more rewarding for those who know the Bard better than I.

There are only two real strategic paths: build the stage, or hire actors and costume them.  And the latter seems (after only three plays, I admit) far stronger.

But it's a neat idea.  I hope my friend hangs onto this a bit longer.

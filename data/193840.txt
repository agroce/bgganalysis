Light-hearted game of trying to attack others.  With the random player order when coming to a group of tokens, you can't have too much strategy, and should mostly try to have fun with the theme/flavor.

RATING: 6
Challenging rate. One unfinished play with 8P that took *forever* to play. 90 minutes to get halfway through, at which point I was heading home. The bits are fantastic, the theme is fantastic, whole lot to love about it. Could use a lot of streamlining in rules, though, and seems to more or less demand a group that is committed to playing light and fast. Really shows what one can do with just a bit of production, the 3D tables and such aren't expensive and really pop.

Initial Impression: I'm not a big fan of the character artwork in the game but I love the 3D components. This is a programmed movement game with the added advantage in that you don't have to program too far in advance. This results in just the right amount of chaos without making the players feel they're not in control. The addition of the flagon in the middle of the board entices players to move to a common area and "interact" with each other. The overall gameplay is fun and the turns flow smoothly. Downtime is minimal, although AP can be a potential problem for some players. My one niggle is that this game, at least the tavern map, should be experienced with more than 4 players. More players = more interaction = more chaos = more fun.

RATING: 7
This is a lighthearted programming game about a bar fight. You can jump on the tables, pick up a chair and throw it at a guy, throw your mug, pull a rug to make someone fall, and a few other funny things you might imagine from a bar fight. Ultimately the tactics can't be taken too seriously, but this game is a chaotic good time. I have yet to play it with a larger group of people, which I will say would be even better, and might increase my opinion on the game further.

Update : A higher player count makes this game shine more, as the chaotic bar brawling nature really comes out with the crowded bar scene. Actions tend to have a better chance of affecting more people.

RATING: 4
At first The Dragon and Flagon looks like a light and cheerful game: after all, any self-respecting roleplayer has fond memories of at least a few serious brawls in a fantasy tavern; thus, a boardgame focusing on such merry occurrences can’t but pique their interest.

Then the actual game begins and all of a sudden all the expected fun disappears: it’s a slog through too many fiddly rules and lots of downtime.
So much for your light «beer and pretzels» game!

My friends and I were able to participate in The Dragon & Flagon event at Gencon and it was a lot of fun. This is probably the programmable game I'd most want to play right now. The only issue I have is that I think it plays best with at least 5+ people. I'm very excited to try the different characters and expect to keep this in my collection for a long time.

This has that Engelstein trademark of being very procedural and a little more heavy mechanically than the theme and artwork imply. Yet, just like their other games, they manage to pack in the fun and make the effort and structure enjoyable. 

This is a chaotic brawl that has action programming and takes advantage of the best parts of this mechanism: causing confusion and mistakes. It has a really solid narrative and is good for laughs when someone falls on their face or slapped upside the head with a chair.

I'm not a fan of most of the art in this game but I am a big fan of the 3D components. They seriously up the enjoyment.

Similar to Roborally. Be prepared to be knocked over constantly by thrown chairs and tankards, rug-pulls and shoved tables only to waste your turn because you are no longer where you intended to be when you planned the move. Frustrating and slow but nicely produced.

RATING: 6.5
I almost feel like there is too much going on in this game.  I don't really enjoy "movement planning" types of games where you have to make decisions about what you are going to do two or three turns ahead of when you are going to do it - it limits your ability to react to what others are doing.

The production value is nice, and the 3D elements of the pieces on the board add a nice visual touch.  So visually, it is a nice game.  But not enough to make me want to play it regularly.

Rating after 2 plays. Fun preprogrammed free for all game. The strategy is in positioning for best combo actions. If done well the score will be very swingy and the thematics will really click. Very easy to teach. Need to play more to explore all of the characters and action cards.

It took until my third play to feel I'd had a proper experience of the game. It really depends on the players you have. It can be really fun if everybody is into it. It's just that the mechanics, while very clever don't automatically give the game the beer and pretzels feel that I think it was aiming for. You need a group that lends that feel to it and it works really well.

I really admire the unique theme and goals of this design.   It is fun to play, and pretty much out of control right from the beginning, so you just have to hang on for the ride.   It's a little crunchier than I would like for a game of this weight.   There are a lot of rules and "what-ifs" that have to be checked.  Too many.   Like what happens if a barrel hits a barrel?  What happens if a person is pinned against the wall by a table?  Can you swing a sword if you are face down on top of a table?   What happens to your special power card if you lose the Flagon?   None of this stuff is missed in the rules, but it requires a lot of checking.  The icons for push back and knock down are also pretty bad....  move left, move backward?  Huh?  But, in the end, it was definitely fun, and it created some pretty hilarious fight scene moments.   Would certainly play again, but now that I've played, I definitely don't need to own it.

An entertaining game, but watch the "All the games you like are bad" video on this one and he describes some of the issues I had with our game. Basically, messing up isn't funny, it's just a lot of swings and misses prolonging the game while nothing happens. Maybe we needed more than5 players?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I normally like programmed-movement games and do pretty well with them, but there's a bit too much chaos in Dragon & Flagon to make it something I just gotta play.  Don't get me wrong at all - DnF is a hilariously fun game of errors as you are constantly rocked and checked by other players.  I like it just fine and would play it again.

On a relative scale, however, it rates a bit lower than others of its ilk because I find that the strategy isn't quite as solid as it could be and there is a real need to fully understand your deck before you can effectively play.  For probably 80% of my turns, I started out knocked flat on my ass.  Poor planning on my part, yes, but your options are incredibly limited when you have to program several moves in advance.  I would have liked a more tactical approach to this barroom brawl - the daze mechanic is just fine as it is, but you're pretty much dazed the entire time.  You wouldn't think that two moves ahead is that damaging, but take it from a guy who got knocked down almost every turn - it is much more devastating than you might think.  The reason for this is that the game is over before it starts.  You're just getting into position and BAM, the guards show up and that's it.  I think maybe at most you play 8-10 turns, though I wasn't really keeping count.

Anyways, DnF when not taken too seriously is a great way to spend an evening with a bunch of friends, chucking chairs and mugs at each other while hilarious happy accidents occur.  If I seem sour, it's only because I see potential for a more tactical game which is just an opportunity lost, but that mostly stems from me not really being the audience for this.

Still, I would gladly play it again, though perhaps it wouldn't be my first choice.

The type of game that immediately draws people over to your table because it looks sooooo cool.  Excellent production with a wealth of game content.  Each character deck seems almost over-stacked with moves and the pirate variant on the back of the board was a welcome addition.  Not to mention: 9 playable characters seems like a lot for a base game.  As for the game itself, it was well designed but a bit too slow moving for my taste - programmable movement always feels sluggish to me (a mechanic I almost always take issue with).  Also with four people (each paying two characters) it took longer than it should.  We all started to feel a bit fatigued at about the half way point.  I'm interested in keeping it in my collection and trying again.  It's a very novel theme and who doesn't love those little wooden chairs?  ;)

I love the idea of a fantastical bar-room brawl. This is a lot of fun, with plenty of random senseless violence. The initiative track works well to balance abilities, but it does slow down the resolution somewhat compared to similar games such as Roborally.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I’m not sure if this one has any staying power or not but just based on my one play, I had an absolute blast playing it. It’s a skirmish game where you get to beat on your friends. I threw a stein at the back of a wizard's head, a rug was literally pulled out from under someone, and a cat was smashed against a wall with a table. All in good fun. 

I'm not sure if this would get old but I'm tempted to buy this and play only with 6p as more people means more chaos means more fun. I'm generally not a fan of programming actions but I took to it with gusto for some reason here. You have to plan 2 action cards on your board and then you get to see how things play out before committing to more cards. Each character has special attacks that only they can make along with the basic cards. Sure, as with all card programming games there are wasted moves, but that's part of the fun. Would make for a good "chug" penalty in a drinking gaming.

The 3D components -- tables, chairs, rugs, and mugs – are great and put you in the right thematic frame of mind.

BattleCon takes the idea of a real-time fight and really streamlines it. This game takes the idea of a real-time brawl and makes it into a incredibly fiddly (even choosing an action for a turn is a bit fiddly). Clearly better with more players than less, I still lack the interest in setup and choosing from such a large stack of cards.

I really wanted to enjoy this game. There was just so much to the setup that by the time I had it ready to play, no one wanted to play it anymore. I've tried 4 times. Once I got to actually try the first round, but everyone as so disinterested we just tore it back down once again and never touched it again.

Think Red Dragon Inn, but with strategy and excitement! You have to plan your moves, i.e. throwing beer mugs, chairs, tables. Once you pick your card of what type of action you will take, it is out of your hands. Other players may move first, which could mean that the item you threw or movement you took could mean nothing. Think barroom brawl in a boardgame!

This is basically a remake of Robo Rally with a fantasy theme, except that there may be a little more complexity (and thus perhaps more AP). The game seemed to drag and the lack of real excitement mixed with the frustration of programable moves brought the enjoyment down for me. The production value of the game is quite good but its not enough make me want more plays.

A little heavier then Colt express and for new gamers without experience of RoboRally or other type of programming games I think that it's quite a learning curve. Why? Because all of the cards, and if you are less then 5 people it's stated that you should have two characters each. I get that from a chaos perspective because you want so much to happen, and yes it will work with 3-4 experienced players. But if you play your first game it might be a little overwhelming.

Tough to rate so far; played briskly, I've enjoyed my time with it. Played slowly (see more below), and it becomes tedious. 
The issue is that while this is a great design with lots to love, there is a bevy of front-loaded information that is somewhat out of proportion to the weight of the game and the apparent depth of decision-making available. That the game encourages risk-averse small-ball and punishes with boring turns for miscalculating doesn't help.

Probably just a little too complex for what it tries to be. A mostly silly just have fun type game, but still an enjoyable experience overall. It feels good to hurl real things around the room and the chaos that ensues really gets you into the whole bar fight theme. Definitely a game that is better the more targets errr...players you have.

RATING: 6.5
Programmed action game with a lot of chaos - which I'm OK with as long as you can mitigate against it as you can here. An improvement on the likes of Roborally or Colt Express in that you only program 2 or 3 moves ahead, meaning that if your plan comes off the rails (and it will) you can recover reasonably quickly.

Winning seems to depend on making the most of your special powers. The game can be brutal, as picking on one player with the 'add one time' special actions can allow you to hold someone against the ropes while you suck away all of their influence and leave them out of it for an extended period of time. This feels brutal, if effective.

The Dragon & Flagon is a tavern world-renowned for its most magical drink, The Dragon. Legend has it that one sip of The Dragon can give a hero wondrous abilities beyond their wildest dreams — but with a tavern full of thirsty adventurers and only one flagon left, things are bound to go wrong. Prepare your magic and grab your weapon because there's only one true objective in this brawl — and it's not just a sip of The Dragon. Only one can win and emerge with the reputation as the greatest fighter ever seen within the walls of The Dragon & Flagon!

The Dragon & Flagon is a game of chaos and mayhem for 2-8 players. Throw mugs, smash chairs, swing from the chandelier, sip from the legendary Dragon Flagon, cast spells, and pull the rug out from under your fellow adventurers as you attempt to build up your reputation and win the day!

This is a two-fisted bar fight game, full of mayhem and laughs. In our game, chandeliers(?) were swung from, spells were cast, tables were pushed, barrels kicked, and, in what was my opinion the Parkview Kia Play of the Game, my character hucked the titular flagon in the head of another character. 

It's one of those games where it is probably best with a lot of people who are playing by the seat of their pants, not analyzing and calculating possible moves (I think that maybe giving everyone nearly their entire deck every round may not help with this.) Play should be fast and frenetic. 

At its heart, this is a miniatures game. There's terrain, facing, movement, firing arcs, planned actions, and so forth, and I am terrible at those games and don't enjoy them. I think the key here is the lightness of the theme. I was frustrated at first because my plans weren't working out and I felt like I was playing any other minis game where I just get my ass handed to me because I can't plan and visualize. But letting go and just rolling with it helped a bunch, and I was soon doing and feeling much better.

This game is sort of a mess.  The production and bits are great, and the theme looks like it should be a home run.  However, the rules are significantly more complex than the theme requires, and the depth of strategy is far too shallow than you want for a game that runs this long.  If the decision tree was smaller and the game play significantly faster, then I think this would be worth it.  But then do you want a game that looks like this and is also so light and short?

It's a crazy bar brawl.  Most players' actions can turn your strategies senseless, the mechanics are chaotic, players can team up to destroy one character quite easily, but those trusts can be broken at any moment...much like a tavern fight!  True, there is not a lot of depth to this game. However, it's fast paced, a quick and easy learn, lends itself well to 'learn-as-you-go', allows for up to 8 players, and it's fun. So after all that, the lack of complexity is easy to overlook. Love it!

Fun programming style game a bit like Robo Rally with a fun theme.  A little bit chaotic but it matches the theme well.  Don't need since I already own Robo Rally.

This game is so close to being great! Haven't tried the pirate ship side, which I hear can be more fun, so looking forward to that.

So close... with some slight tweaks I bet this game could be really good. I might have to house rule things and see what happens...

Barroom Brawl - The Board Game !! I think this game is an absolutely clever blast. Pull rugs to trip people! Throw chairs and mugs! Swing from chandeliers! Show off fancy swordplay, martial arts moves, or superpowers!

The audience for this game is a group that knows the various symbols and mechanisms, that does not mind chaos nor programmed movement, that likes the idea of a barroom brawl in a box, and that plans on playing this game regularly. This is not a game to play once. To access the potential magic of this game, the group has to get through the learning curve, and commit to minimal AP to maximize the fun.

I probably won't play this as much as I'd love to, and I won't own this because I don't have the people to play it regularly.

Based on one play: Your goal is simple, be the coolest guy at the pub. To do so you must look good while making others look foolish. So you move around and throw things at others, push tables and are just generally a pain in the but to everyone. The theme is great and the components are really nice. The game play is just card based as you plan ahead and then hope for the best as you steal prestige from others while they attempt to do the same. A nice theme and concept, just not my style of game play.

Most meaningful interactions with other players come down to a coin toss of whose token gets drawn first. For example, two players are often trying to attack each other, perhaps kicking a barrel. The loser suffers a 28-points swing and skips their next one or two turns. I really dislike lose-a-turn mechanics, and in a game where end-game scores typically range from 15-25, a 28 point swing is obscenely punitive for a coin flip.

Despite coming in 2nd place I felt very bad about making the other players skip their turns all the time. Will not play again.

Not into the pub brawl thing, but besides that, I think it is a fun idea to pick up a mug and throw it at other people. I am going to pull the rug from beneath you so, HA!  It is pretty hilarious. Kinda slow moving at first while people muddle through the very large deck of cards and actions presented, but towards the end it is more quick. Clever and fun game. Might be to much downtime if you are waiting for your turn, but overall some good fun.

RATING: 5.5
"Chaos and mayhem" is about right... too much for some as, even with just one card pre-planned, that can disrupt you for a fifth of the game. AoE powers seem stronger than others: the Paladin always ranks high; but it is a good laugh when played for what it is.

A lot like Colt Express, with a bit more control, but the theme has been done a hundred times and doesn't interest me nearly as much. Each hero has a unique and powerful ability, but it is only unlocked by picking up the flagon. It is unlikely you'll win without it, so the strategy gets to be a bit predictable.

A very fun programmed-movement game, probably the best form that tricky mechanic has yet taken. I love the blow-by-blow accounts you can give of the whole fight. The components are also terrific, a combination of wooden and cardboard components that make the whole thing feel more immediate. The only issue is that there are a lot of bottle-necks where the game can bog down in process. It really requires a single player to keep things moving, reminding players when it's their turn and what needs to happen next.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I need to play it with more, but it just seems like the downtime really ruins this game. This needs to move very quickly, but it can happen a lot where you have absolutely nothing to do when your turn comes around, and then you're just sitting there waiting for the next turn, hoping something works out. It's okay, but not what I was hoping for.

RATING: 3
A programmed-action bar room brawl game with a time-track mechanic.  The rules are unclear, and the gameplay is way too long and tedious.  The subject matter demands something that's fast and fun, but instead it's full of analysis paralysis compounded by a near-total lack of information on which to base decisions.  Really, the only good part is the three-dimensional tables and wooden chairs.

I do not typically like programming type mechanics, but I had a great time playing this game as it really represents the chaos found during a bar brawl. The game has great components. When playing, it helped having someone at the table who was very familiar with the rules as some of the interactions between characters, furniture, and actions were not obvious.

Note: Played with 8 players.

Good game, but it is a little too complicated to be the quick fun it needs to be to convey the theme. Having all the cards to choose from is a little too much, even when you break them down in to card types, and to keep the game moving, players need to put a reduced effort into picking the card they want to play. Unfortunately, the Engelstein name is becoming synonymous with slightly over-complicated rule sets. Visually stunning though.

This game presents a bit of a conundrum. Its artwork and setting indicates a lively and fast experience, while its gameplay provides something more deliberate. The result is a programmed movement game that's unexpectedly smart and humorous, with plenty of ways to mess with opponents. Roll a barrel! Swing from the chandelier! Chuck a stein! Lots of fun.

The Dragon & Flagon is pretty fun despite a few weak spots in the game design/dev and visual design. I think a little editing would make the second edition/printing really shine. Overall, a really decent “beer and pretzels” game that reminds me of a lot of brawl-style video games.

Need to play this a few more times to get a good feel for it. I really enjoy the chaos that comes with the programmed movements and I like the "time" element to the movements that can result in unexpected things to happen.  

I feel like the time spent resolving actions is a little clunky sometimes but that might just get better as we play it more.  Otherwise I really have fun with this.

Definitely not my kind of game, even though I was looking forward to playing it based on theme and looks. My first (and only) play of it was with six players, which may have soured the experience. To me the game falls in between a fun brawler and a tactical game, and falls short because it's neither. The rules explanation is quite lengthy, because you need to know the nuances of each general action card. After that, the game is very chaotic, especially when you do not yet know the special cards specific to the characters involved. And even though we played quite fast (with experienced gamers), the game really outlasted its welcome, taking too much time for what it has to offer. It just all sounded better on paper.

Rating after initial play, there is more to explore for sure.  This is probably my favorite programmed movement game by a long shot.  It's also my favorite Royal Rumble sort of game, like it much more than Ultimate Warriorz.

Do feel that a few things hold it back slightly, really not a fan of the character artwork, and with low budget artwork, I'm not sure why it's limited.  I was often getting confused seeing people play a card with a specific character on it and thinking they were that character when it's really just generic artwork.  The game is pretty finnicky, it's fun moving your own character and doing your own move, but it really requires someone to be sort of game manager, constantly keeping players alert of when their turn is up, when they need to play their second card, moving chips around the turn counter, etc.  There can definitely be like 4 turns in a row where it feels like you never do a single thing, or you're stuck in the corner all game.

Coming back to this... I really just lost all desire to play this game again after my three plays.  It just has weird pacing to me.  More down time than I'd like, maybe too many options.  I want more of a fast paced brawl and instead it can feel too often like I'm waiting several turns to do one cool thing and then I get tripped and can't do it.

I had a lot of fun playing this game.  But, since it is (sort of) a multi-player wargame, everyone needs to have a sense of who is winning, so they can beat up on the right person.

So, it might be better as a team game.  I'm looking forward to trying it this way.

I picked this up at Essen - more out of reflex than anything else. And after reading so many bad reviews I didn´t have any high expectations. But tell you something: the last two weeks we have been playing this game over and over - with glee. (There are so many "big" games waiting to be played... but all everybody wants, is another brawl in the tavern).
Do yourself a favor and play it the right way: turn up joyful music, get yourself a good mug of beer and always have good food within reach. Seriously, this game is a different story if you set the stage right. Then, I would suggest to not play it with more than 4! If you have 2 characters each, 3-4 players is perfect: the place is crowded. but you hardly have any downtime. If you have new players: forget about the yellow cards for the first game, so they can handle 2 characters at once. With 4 players, we love to play gilrs vs. boys.

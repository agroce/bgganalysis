Played at Gen Con 2017. An interesting network building game with an 1800s theme. Acquire workers by buying stage coaches... drop them off via visiting specific locations on the board via your network... get a 'special ability' for doing so.

Initial Thoughts:
Received through a Kickstarter in conjunction with Merlin. Decent production quality. One of the meeples is missing a piece of his leg and can't stand correctly.

1st Playthrough Thoughts:
This game appears deceptively simple. Very simple actions and quick turns but has the potential for some strategy and turn forethought. Looking forward to the next playthrough.

Great game! Little more going on than ticket to ride. There are little bit of every classic euro game mechanic in this game and they all work great togheter. Some intresting things can happen in this game and its very interactive. The game feels like a mix of catan, ticket to ride with added auctions, pick up and delivery and investment. Higly recommend this game. Kickstarted this and merlin. Sold merlin and kept this one!

Pioneers is a straightforward Euro game of building routes on a map and adding workers along those routes. It's a nice design and also very simple. That's okay because it works. Players collect income and then either pick up carriages with different types of workers or build routes or both. The board shows all the different types of workers and players must match those workers from their carriages. Players grab the tile from the board when their workers are put on the board. The worker benefits may allow someone to add more workers to that space, or pick up a worker for more income or more actions, or dismiss a worker from a carriage (that may be hard to place). Empty carriages score points and workers on the board connected by a contiguous group of connections also score. The last part of a turn is moving the carriage and adding workers to the board from carriages. I found this to be a nice game with not a lot of variability. I'd play it again.

I really enjoyed this game. It's super-fast, tactical, and cut-throat as players rush to build routes, claim passengers, and refill their carriages. You build a nice little engine and the game doesn't overstay its welcome. I'd call it a great filler but with setup it might be slightly too long for that.

 players attempt to populate the cities shown on the game board with their pioneers, using coaches to transport them around the map. Each pioneer has a specific profession, and can only be settled in a city where their work is needed.
After all the pioneers riding in a coach have been deployed on the game board, the player controlling the coach earns money and victory points. In addition, the players construct roads between the cities, expanding their own network and earning money from other players who use the roads. At the end of the game, each player will be rewarded with additional victory points based on the number of their pioneers in their largest network of connected roads. The player with the most victory points wins!

First play - 2-player:  The game played relatively quick.  The game very much feels like Ticket to Ride, but with  the colored routes flipped to colored destinations instead.  There is somewhat less diversity in the wagons than in TtR routes, but this works well and prevents some of the long route bias which occurs in TtR.  What is very nice is that the tiles are dealt each game, which improves replay-ability (no two games are the same).  Additionally, the destination tiles provide a benefit as well, which makes the game more interesting.  Where some people may find this game falls short is in competition, it is not until the end of the game where it becomes highly competitive for locations.

It is reasonably quick and light to play.  You know when the end of the game may be coming and because some of the victory points are hidden there is still some catch-up opportunity.  Overall, it feels reasonably well balanced.

This game largely lacks direct competition until the end of the game and appropriate strategizing minimizes this further.  Unfortunately, this results in a bland game for people that prefer tension and conflict.  Personally, this is not the type of game I would typically expect or necessarily want  to have high conflict.  By example, I find games of TtR where your opponent constantly blocks you and prolongs the game to be irritating and less fun.  You can slow your opponent down and make them pay your to use your routes, but you are unable to simply block them from delivering passengers.  

Based off the first play, what keeps me from ranking this higher is a lack of depth and I am not entirely sure about balance in the game just yet.  It is a good family friendly game and less contentions than similar games.

Pioneers is a route building game driven by a light touch of pick-up and deliver. The game is very friendly to newcomers with its large step-by-step artwork and easy to read iconography. So welcome in fact, that it appears to be a more children-focused game than in reality. While it is light, strategy emerges mainly in building routes. Players must travel each turn and if you use an opponents route, players must pay a toll to that player. This makes for some interesting planning. During the game, this cycle continues to drop off pioneers while avoiding others' roads at a steady pace, but little arc. The winner is generally decided by the best network at the end of the game. Players want to connect the most of their pioneers on a single network as possible. This endgame is nice in that it works well with the main mechanics of the game. Pioneers is pleasant game, that is overlooked in favor of others. While enjoyable, it lacks the strategic enjoyment of its contemporaries.

Needs more plays, but this one impressed and suprised me alot. I knew of the existence of this game, but I ignored it when it came out. However, a friend of mine wanted to play it, so here we are...

Ornella always had nice ideas in his games, so I normally always have a look at his games and while most of his stuff doesn't get higher praise, this one is really up there.

Take any of the millions of train games and break it down to the core and you get something like Pioneers. It's so easy and yet there are plenty of interesting choices and even strategies to choose from. There's nothing new here, but the game offers so much with just a small rules set, that makes it a great one.

Perfect family game that even gamers should like.

A weird little route builder. Iconography is very clean and easy to explain/understand. It is not quite so obvious what you should do though, not sure how much that would trip people up.

First game we played, everyone got a +1 income tile off the bat except for 4th player. He was really unhappy about that thinking due to luck he had a huge disadvantage, but he ended up getting one a few rounds later, and he actually won the game AND had the most money left over. So there doesn't seem to be any issues with random setup balances haha. (Our final scores were all actually pretty close.)

There's just nothing remarkable or innovative about this game. Just feels like a very bland game without any excitement. Probably due to players being able to do most things with no restrictions except for the tight economy. Playing this reminds me of Railroad Revolution which I would rather play anytime over this. Pioneers is incredibly rules light though so might be a good gateway game for new players.

Pioneers is a light to medium weight Euro. Players gain points by putting their workers on the board and having a large connected network linking them at game end. Moves are brief with players collecting income, doing up to three purchases and moving the coach once. The game should clock in below an hour. 

I enjoyed my play and would like to play it more. It could become a good alternative to games like Thurn & Taxis if it can prove its longevity. It also could lack the decisive spark for repeated play. The simple but probably decisive development of the two mini tech trees (income & purchases) might be an annoying gamebreaker if players will be excluded from the respective spaces consistently.

RATING: 6
Quick playing route building game in which players are traveling together in a stagecoach taking turns being the captain of the coach. Reminds me a lot of Ticket to Ride in the sense that you are trying to complete your route tickets in a very similar way, although this time the tickets are kind of flexible. Compared to TtR it lacks a bit of the tension and Pioneers may just be too friendly of a game. Other players' options are transparently visible and there is not so much going on with blocking and screwing.

RATING: 5
Pioneers is a bit too complicated to be a family weight game. It's decisions are not quite interesting and plentiful to appeal to more seasoned gamers. At best it is a next-step game, useful for introducing new concepts but a short stepping stone before desiring meatier fare.

RATING: 8
In this game players are spending money to lay down roads, buy tiles full of meeples, and then moving the shared stagecoach meeple into a unresolved spot, removing the colored token, and dropping off a matching meeple in that area. Each meeple type has a special ability when dropped off which is interesting. When a stagecoach token is empty it's worth it's printed points, and at the end of the game you get 1 point per one of your meeples connected through a chain of your roads.

Much of the challenge of the game comes from the tight economy. Players get a base income of $3 per turn, which can be increased to as much as $5 with the right turn order luck and/or planning by picking up yellow spots. On other players turns you have opportunities to drop a meeple after they do in matching color by giving them $2, and you have to also pay other players to traverse road spots they own. This results in a lot of money being handed back and forth.

Starting turn order might be a little bit of an issue with the game, as the randomly distributed tokens might only put one yellow 'income increasing' tile near the start of the map. This might give the player who grabs it a bit of an advantage, but it's hard for me to say if it's actually a problem or not. Overall, I like how you have a limited number of meeples, and so choosing the right carriage to take is actually important. It's also a shortish game, with a little bit of that Steam sensibility to it in the way you can take some advantage of other player's actions by paying them.

This game came as part of the Kickstarter with Merlin. It's mostly a route and network building game. Completing placing workers from your wagons to score points and gaining abilities throughout the game to become more efficient. I also like the ability to follow others actions but at a price of giving them some extra cash. All in all it was a pretty light game, but it was fun and an interesting puzzle to solve with building a big route and trying to not get blocked.

Simple rules, engaging play.  Great components, awesome theme.  The game is always different because the tiles are laid out randomly on the board each game.  The 2 player game works great because of the random "no entry" tiles that are mixed in and placed on the board at random.  These tiles prevent players from entering or going through certain locations.  This really makes the game quite interesting.  This is a wonderful family game.  I really enjoy this one a lot!  Best Queen game I've seen in a while.

Rating a game on the thought you are rating it towards Queen, the publisher, is not rating it in the correct place. The Designer is who created the game, playtested it to death, and went out on a limb to reach out to publishers to publish it. Rate the game, not the publisher. The publisher has their own page to rate. Do it there - more will see it there as well, so your stance will be more visible.

Surprisingly good and deep. On the surface, this seems like a simple route-buliding game, but it's actually much more involved than that. You have set collection/contract fulfillment in the stagecoaches that you acquire, and you have to manage your money and actions for how much track you can lay. Your money also has the added benefit of helping you on other people's turns, and so making sure to still have some available during others' turns is crucial. Predicting where the other players will go also injects some challenging chaos that you have to try and mitigate.

A light, elegant map-travelling game. Build a meeple-rich network. Pick up some nuggets. Buy enough coaches to give yourself network options (and score points). 

It is good with all player counts, but we find the 3-player count the sweet spot. The 4-player is rather tactical and the 2-player is rather open.

The game works very well as a family game, but also as a light gamers’ game. Bumped up 8 -> 9 - everyone I’ve played it with likes the game.

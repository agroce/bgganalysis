I was enthusiastic to get it on the table, but first session dissapointed me. No real diplomacy, cards mostly played for their Ops, difficult to get into the theme that way...

So many little-rules and the Rulebook didn't help at all.

Hope it gets better next time...

Great multilayer CDG that scales from 2 up to 5 players.

Looking forward to more plays. It's highly possible that the rating will increase with more plays.

So far I'm really impressed with game play.

Finally got to play and I did enjoy it. The variable game ending possibility is interesting, will have to see whether I like it with more plays. My only criticism is that it can end a game prematurely, as in the first turn! But that could be the fault of some of the players not sacrificing to prevent another from winning.

RATING: 2
Fails as a Euro, because it can go 6-8 hours, and would be incredibly complex as a Euro.  And I can't bring myself to even call it a WAR game; the assertion that it models Napoleonic warfare, even broadly, is farcical.  This game seemed to be designed more as a a multi-player GAME (i.e., read: generic conflict game) laden with "clever" and "unusual" and "unpredictable" sub-mechanisms, with the intent to generate good multi-player tension.  In this it appears they have succeeded to greater or lesser degree.  

But the era might as well be the Middle Ages, or 1914, or Egyptians vs. Hittites.  Barring a few faint nods to the era via the cards, the operational maneuver and battles are generic; one French sp is the same as 1 Danish sp as 1 British sp.  And the "color" combat cards are largely a joke to anyone familiar with the history.  The Prussians can play a Reverse Slope card -- well, the Prus were NOTORIOUS for NOT shielding their troops behind slopes; the Aus have a home card of Hussars -- superb cavalry.  But the history will tell you that the French routinely kicked ASH on the Austrian cav, 9 times out of ten, and the French Hussars were FAR better than the Aus in this war.  Where the hell did they pull THAT card out of?  They got HALF the combat cards wrong, in so much as ANYONE can play them, which is, sorry, CRAP if you stand it up against the history.  Another GAME choice that throws the history under the bus.

They have slapped a Napoleonic label onto a one off RISK variant.  This game purports to be a game on the Napoleonic Wars, yet the lite Euro Memoir '44 even has more of a wargame feel than this "wargame."  At least M'44 has tanks, infantry, and artillery, for the love of Pete.  GENERIC sp, and then the insult of different type ICONS for them -- as if this would somehow add more "color" to the combat system.  Sorry, this almost seems condescending, and it really annoyed me.     

I have to feel a certain level of historicity in a game to call it a wargame, and TNW has next to none.  Other facets have already been well-lambasted by other raters in this list.  My disappointing summation might be that this game has got a ton of PROCESS to it -- some of it clever, a lot of it artificial, but it has no SOUL.

RATING: 7
A pretty fun and playable CDG of the Napoleonic Wars. I've played one game each as Russia, Austria, Britain, and France. While the game is not as difficult as the subject and scope might imply, the rules and aids are the biggest obstacles to learning the game. The rules could really use an index and the administrative tracks could use a few explanatory notes about game set-up. A letter-size sheet that can be photocopied or laminated outlining what players may generally do on a turn and how units function might be helpful. After that, I'm convinced that the two best players should probably play France and Austria (or perhaps France and Britain).

Complex game, which is what makes it fun. Very hard to win as Napoleon. Usually willing to give it a shot.

The guys on the Point2point podcast go on about this game so much that it piqued my interest. I went back and listened to the "all about" episode that they did on this and as a keen Dip player, I figured that it'd not be too much of a leap in to a game that is more "cardy" like Hannibal or Twilight Struggle yet still retains a bit of Diplomacy in there somewhere. We'll soon see if I am right! I've only played one turn of this, as I won after making the peace roll after the first round!

1. Design - GMT point-to-point standard. 
2. Mechanics - war, diplomacy, alliances, traitors. All in Napoleonic flavour, but completely ahistorical
3. Play - what I like in NW is possibly play in various number of players - two, three, four and five. But... only 2 or 3 player game is fun to all.
So, overall rating is lower because when I compare this with "Napoleon Against Europe", we may trash "The Napoleonic Wars" for ever.

RATING: 7
:coffee: :( :D :) :D :D Has to be approached with realistic goals in mind; TNW is a 30,000 foot perspective on the Napoleonic Wars that succeeds more as a figure-8 demolition derby for 2-5 players than as a highly realistic simulation. If that's what you're looking for, I suspect you'll come away happy. Buckets of dice. Swingy cards. Tidy up the rules and slap some Westeros sigils on the whole package and you maybe have the next big Ameritrash bonanza instead of a game that ended up a bit too light for the grogs and too grisly for the general public. So it goes.

Speaking of the rules: I gotta say I had a few "yeah, but how the hell do you [i]play[/i] this game?" moments while perusing the damned things. I hate to rag on people who've forgotten more about game design than I'll ever know, but these rules are ... not great. Less than clear. I pretty much feel like I have them surrounded at this point, but it took a few rounds of exegesis to get to that point.

One other petty point, and I'm risking a drumhead court-martial at the hands of the True Wargamers here, but the physical manifestation of the game is not fantastic. I like mounted boards, and the extra-thick counters GMT are rocking these days. I know this game pre-dates those and I'm being irrational but it's an absence I feel when I crack this out.

Anyway, yes, the actual game. It works. There's a big deck of cards, and not a lot of cards actually used in a turn. Every game will be different. (The War of 1812 can show up ahead of schedule or not at all, to take but one example.) Sometimes, you get your pocket picked by a bad hand, and with a wide range of Ops values on the cards, small hand sizes, and a limited number of turns those twists of fate can truly roger you but good. It's basically fine but control freaks are hereby on notice.

The little annoyances threaten to but ultimately do not defecate on the experience from a great height. And the good stuff is quite clever. The minor powers act more like rational actors than in, say, Here I Stand. The diplomacy system is clever and straightforward once you get past its inscrutable presentation. The alliance system does a nice job of allowing the player powers some diplomatic leeway without creating dull juggernauts It's playable in a reasonable length of time. It nicely supports all play counts between 2 and 5, which is a feat worthy of applause. And it's nicely flavorful despite the abstraction. Most of all, it's just chaotic fun with a side-dish of history.

RATING: 7
At the end of a five players game ended at the fourth turn with an overwhelming French victory (I was the English player) I can say that the game is very intriguing. The most interesting aspect, in my opinion, is that the Coalition players must gang against France and yet only one of them, if any, can win. Tough!

GMT Games.  Really good, solid Napoleonic's war game.  This card driven multi-player game has it all - Generals, army formations, naval battles, Alliance changes, minor powers being dragged into the conflict and deal making between the powers.  The point area movement system works well.  Players make decisions continuously whether to play cards to move units, raise more troops or play the cards for their text impact.  I prefer the enlarged deluxe map and I like the second edition cards.  Great game with 4 players.  Can handle 5 but the Prussian player may be a little bored the first couple of hours.

RATING: 6
This game falls short in many ways. The main area is that it does not feel like a Napoleonic game. The 2 years turns take away the diplomacy, maneuvering and absolute dominance of France in the early years. This coupled with a gimick that could end the game after any turn take away any semblance of the overwhelming dominance and determination of Napoleon and France. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
This is a fun game and a great introduction to the wargame with cards for points or events method that many games seem to have (Hannibal, PoG, Twillight Struggle, etc). 

This is the game that convinced me I could go to the WBC and have fun - if I could win at Napoleonic Wars against my friend who won the 2 player version at WBC, then I have a chance at doing the same!

Sadly this game takes a long time to play so its set aside in favor of faster games at all my parties it seems. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A medium weight CDG made more complex by lots of chrome and an involved naval system that occasionally comes into serious play. I've played with three, four, and five players, and I think the game shines with five when the various Coalition partners (at least initially) are keeping one eye over their shoulders to make sure they won't get screwed. France needs to go after Vienna in a big way to avoid weak combat rolls as the game only seems to "work" when everyone is fighting against France, at least early on. Second ed rules are a vast improvement in terms of organization, although you will spend a lot of time looking things up in early games.

RATING: 5
1 play.
NNot much to do with the historical period. This more of a generic Risk like, bucket of dice game.
The game has a lot of problems to be a good game:
- Combats are too random, only number matters, position and quality are almost irrelevant. Welcome to Risk.
- Too many gamey cards.
- Cards are too unpredictable and really heavy on games impact. Welcome to Poker.
- End of game system is absurd as is prevents planning. It has to be “all in” every turn, just in case a 6 is rolled.
- Game mechanisms are Risk like: the stronger gets stronger and wins more both on the combat system and on the cards/resources.
- The lack of historicity is painful: it is total fantasy or laziness in research.
Overall, there is very little strategic depth on the map and in the game. Bucket of dice and luck at drawing cards will rule.

See my review of the first edition. In short, a pretty good multi-player CDG along the lines of Wellington, but with much less chaos. The political track and the fact that, at the end of the day everyone is playing for himself, gives the game greater depth, too.

Not that I'm suggesting the game is especially realistic - it isn't. There's no supply system, for example. If you're looking for [i]Empires in Arms[/i] you won't find it here, but it's great fun. And unlike [i]Empires in Arms[/i] you can actually get it to the table and finish it.

The second edition makes some welcome changes. Some of the nastier "take that" cards are now discarded after use, minors are no longer a liability, and routing an army can lead to a resource. The rulebook could [i]really[/i] use an index, however.

Grand scope in a quick fun game (although I've had a couple of horror marathons). Rules are clearer now.
Still has luck playing a large role, so be prepared to declare a winner and set it up again.
I find its best as a 3-player game since other numbers will leave people twiddling thier thumbs watching everyone else having a fun time.
Player mats I can take or leave, but new cards to good too even if they may have very little impact... depends if they come up at the right time. :-)

RATING: 7
Only one play of this so far (3-player) and it was very difficult to judge the game by it. The rule book is a real pig to try and learn the game from and didn't seem much better as a reference. Although none of us had played this before we had all played a number of CDG's previously so it should not have been as hard as it was to get the game up and running but it was. It took us just under 6 hours to complete 2 turns (fortunately peace broke out and a winner was declared). Rules look up and head scratching as to how things worked accounted for a lot of that but I don't think the game is actually all that complex - perhaps we were having a bad day.

Once you get up and running without needing the rulebook I suspect there is a pretty good multi-player CDG which invokes the Napoleonic period rather well. Not sure I would want to play with more than 3 - I just don't think the Austrian/Russian or Prussian players will have enough to do but hard to tell from one far from expert play.

If you want to play this game I strongly advise you to get someone to teach it rather than learn from the rule book.

RATING: 8
Much easier than it would seem at first, this is an intriguing multi-player cdg. The basics are quite familiar, but the addition of diplomacy, with countries leaving or joining the two alliance during the game makes the game shine. As with any other cdg, knowledge of the card deck can help during play but it is still playable and enjoyable even if you don't know all the cards.
Worth rounding up 3-4 other players to give it a go.

Chaotic but fun with 5 players if you have time for a full game (8 hours). If you don't have time, don't bother with 5, because Prussia has almost nothing to do on the first round and possible second also and Austria is a door mat. 3 player game feels better in this sense since everybody has something to do all the time. Value is for 3 player game. 5 player game is around 7.5. If you really have 8 hours to put on this game then 5 players works extremely well also.

RATING: 7
Just one short game.  I liked the look and a lot of the play of this one.  I like the simple mega-dice combat, especially that you can win the battle while taking more losses, and I like how the neutral powers bring event cards into the game.  Overall, much more dynamic than Sword of Rome (perhaps to be expected given the much greater length).  The game narrative doesn't feel enslaved to the cards, which I like, although the cards in our game tended to be used most frequently as CPs.

A few problems seemed clear.  The game fits in a weird time hole, where it is a little to long to play in one afternoon, and perhaps not deep enough to warrant such trouble.  We played with 4 and I thought 5 was needed to make the side-switching more likely and interesting, but the game seems to be considered by many as too dull for the 5th player.  The peace die roll is bonkers - you can't have a game this size be so dependent on group psychology or light risk management.  My proposed variant is that when a nation can offer a card to adjust the peace die roll, they must do so if they legally can and another power can yet win the game by roll.

I would like to give it another go, but it didn't go over that well, so it may be a while.

IMO, this is a 2nd tier CDG far below Here I Stand, SoR, PoG, Successors (3rd) and Hannibal.

Very fun game that offers a wealth of possibilities. I love the diplomatic track; it makes so much sense, but I'm not a fan of the buckets of dice system and card draws seem a bit too capricious, but these are my only quibbles. History is light but not absent and the interaction within the game mechanics is more impressive with each play. This game gets better with practice and is certainly my favorite multiplayer wargame.

I do wish some of the history was more at play (Prussian reforms, British balance of power diplomacy), but you cannot have it all right? I would like to see this transported to the War of the Austrian Succession and Seven years War.

lots of promise here.  But, in the three complete full player games I have played, Britain was destroyed on the first turn, and in two of them someone switched sides to France and gifted the French the game.  In all three games, the people were different and I was Russia or Austria and had at least one chance for sudden death victory and failed the roll.  So, my rating isn't sour grapes because I was thrashed, but it is the historical problem that the Royal Navy usually gets crushed and the requirement for the game to include all rational Coalition players, and that seems to be an impossible dream.

RATING: 7
I adore the time period, and I have faith that the game feels different with each player count in worthy ways. The rules are a disaster, and needlessly obtuse to a ridiculous degree; but once you internalize them things move relatively swiftly and usually cleanly.
That said, the game suffers from a few intractable flaws. For one, I fail to see how France can do well if everyone gangs up on it, and I fail to see how France doesn't run away with the game unless everyone gangs up on it. I guess I just don't appreciate games where there's a nominal team but only one winner.
Shockingly fun and interesting given the train-wreck of a rules manual. Can't hold a candle to Successors, though.

Not bad for what it is; beer and pretzel NAP wars. A blast with the right group.

Although, the single shared deck is SO imbalanced (the worst cards in the deck vs the best - a MASSIVE difference). A number of cards allow you to draw additional cards; which usually means a player with great cards stomps around the board while those with crap hands cry in their beer and eat their stale pretzels. 

On the plus side: A number of smart concepts in this game (variable ending is cool). Like the crazy outcomes on the bucket of die huge battles.

The initial situation is just right and the atmosphere of the times seems well captured, but the scoring of points for capturing 'keys' encourages gamey tactics and the rules as written often make no sense. Why can France still win the game (with keys controlled) once Paris has been conquered? There is clearly much potential here, so I can see why this has a dedicated fan base, but I can also see why it has gone through several editions without findind its finished form. Overall this is a luck-driven dice fest that goes on FAR too long. We took 3 hours for the first turn, and then the game ended after just one turn!

Flawed, but somewhat brilliant. This is no HIS, but it is pretty good. The peace die roll is incredibly annoying and some of the other mechanics are below par and lets not get started on historical value, but you know what it is pretty fun.

After Here I Stand and some of the more "evolved" CDGs, it's gray hairs are showing a bit more.  It's a great idea and the powers are asymmetric but it's much more limited in options.  The handling of minor powers is great but in the end, there are too many cards to see any of them in play frequently so in the end, it becomes mostly a "Dudes on a Map" wargame rather than a epic diplomatic game.  It's not bad, in fact, it's fun but I think HiS has my future plays. [This is based on 1 game, where I played Prussia and never entered the war or rolled a single die for battle but won from my diplomatic conquents and unspent resource].

With two players, the cards are too wildly different in power and too many are not distinctive or interesting enough. And the plus-card and pre-empt mechanics are terrible, in that it makes the powerful nations with many cards even more powerful. Also, the game can quickly become unbalanced if one player gets the upper hand, because the strong get stronger (taking land means you get more resources, and the opponent fewer, next turn). And the mechanics favour the strong, leading to further unbalance.

The diplomacy rules do not work very well either. I think it would be better if the consuls could only be moved by events, or if there was randomization; now it's always move-countermove (or no countermove because the other player is out of cards). Perhaps the current model works better with many players. 

The ending mechanic (at the end of every turn you roll a modified D6, on a 6, the game is over) sounds brilliant but isn't. In theory, everyone has to play to win all the time, and can't hunker down and build in preparation for the final turn. In practice, people play the long game anyway, players late in the turn sequence are bullied into spending their resources to make the game not end, and I find it's too much of an anti-climax when the game ends on turn 1 or 2.

Here I Stand did a lot of the wrongs here right instead.

I like much more Wellington and Kutuzov in this system. 

However it is still interesting gaming experience. 

What I don't like much are victory conditions and backstabbing all time. Also game is not very interesting for Prussian player. He basically waits few hours until he gets some interesting decisions to make. I don't like diplomacy either. 

Also compared to other games in series you have less flexible cards, no plus cards with exception of national cards. 

It is also little long for what it is.

RATING: 9
Napoleonics riding on the card-driven games train.  It is a great subject using this kind of system.  The map looks nice and the counters look great.  One thing I am worried about card-driven game being applied to Napoleonics is the creation of a false sense of speed during that period.  Actually, the soldiers at that time move slow to find one great pitched battle.  The time suppression could have been a problem for this type of strategic scale game.  But the use of strategy cards could have corrected the time issue.  If the designer can find the right balance on the scale of everything, this should be a great game.  (Looking for GMT reprint in coming Jun 08.)

After several plays, I am deeply impressed by the game system and the way it handles the war.   The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) is a fascinating game but the rulebook is not one of the best. I have to re-read every time I play the game but then many special rules are on the cards already. Occasional rules checking is required when the special rules mix in the basic ones. The cards are rich and put in a very proper context, thus rendering plausible effects and reflecting the era to a good proportion, although sometimes you might think whether all things happen with a 1 in 6 chance of a dieroll.

Playing the game with the interaction of the cards at hand really gives you the feeling that you are reading a very good book about this epic era and how great it is. I played a 5-multiplayer game as Russian and I quite like to step in the shoes of Tsar Alexander I as Russia is a land power that must be reckoned with on Turn 1 for Austria to survive. A Turkish War (by event card) happened in our game at Russia's backdoor moving away some of my troops. But then Kutuzov still enabled the Austrian defense in Vienna, forcing Napoleon choosing a southern strategy.

It turns out that Napoleonic War is really an insightful game. The map looks nice and the counters look great. As the game play progresses, however, I find everything happened quite proportionate and natural to the time scale, posing real difficult and different decisions to each side. 

The Napoleonic War is a wild game. Anything could have happened. The game really could portrays the Napoleonic world as is. It integrates and welds well together the military and political worlds. In the "Interphase", a Power can change side to another camp (only Britain and France never change side). Guess how nasty it could be. Players interact constantly for political alliance. So if both France and Britain actively seek for political support, you can see a hot debate between 2 sides over the air. 

Combat is determined by the no. of dices the attacker and the defender roll separately. Each "6" kills off an enemy unit instantly (including a leader to satisfy a kill if there is insufficient unit to satisfy) while each "5" disrupts one enemy unit, which means they could not participate in the second round battle anymore, in case of a tie in the no. of casualties.  Excess disrupts over the no. of units in combat cancel the leader's battle rating in the second round and other combat modifiers at the player's discretion.   

The side with the most casualties retreats and if the victorious side has inflicted 3 more casualties than the losing side did, it causes a rout to the enemy, which means all units are eliminated - a real disaster! The victorious army then roll to see if they could loot a resource from the routed side by rolling less than his commander battle rating (interesting, the commander has an influence on whether the army can loot, i.e. the better the commander to fight in a battle, a higher chance his soldiers will loot.) 

Victory in the game is determined by the no. of keys a nation hold at the time of peace. There may be a sudden death in the game, when the peace dieroll is "6" o greater, subtracted 1 for each card a nation could receive in the replenishment, at which time the nation with the highest no. of keys controlled wins. Hence, you would find it interesting when Paris is captured by the Allied and yet the French wins the game because he might have controlled more keys than anyone else, added by the remaining resources and minor power pact. I do find this rule interesting to see that the French wins under this situation when Paris falls. In effect, the Allied was pushed to stop Napoleon some point in time with the increasing no. of keys fallen to Napoleon hand. This timing to capture Paris is therefore crucial to the Allied winning. On the other hand, it also prevent Britain from entering Paris too rush when Napoleon was away on the eastern front. As a result, the British player mostly look to Spain and Portugal on the south to muster the required no. of keys to win the game. The Peninsular campaign ensued. 

All in all, this is a much more deeper game than I would have thought in which a lot of the options are available to all sides. Toying around the ideas of these options makes the game truly epic and long-lasting. I like very much this game, though I would have wanted the rules writing more streamlined. The Prussian player might be bored in the first or two turn but, as Prussian is in a very delicate position to balance the power between France and Russia, it may not be the case if he plays the game more actively on the political negotiation. Britain would be alone if the continental powers all join the Imperial (French) camp. Everyone is delicate in the decision to join either camp during the Interphase. Tension builds up as political (the alliance), economic (in terms of resources points) and military (the leaders and army group) factors combine together.

First off: God bless GMT Games for their Tough Economy Special.  Spectacular show of appreciation and respect for their customers.

This game, is simply put, spectacular!  So far I've really enjoyed most of the 3 player game I've tried of it.  Unfortunately the Peace Roll reared it's ugly head already.  If we hadn't caught an easy to miss rule about the three player set-up, the sudden death Peace Roll lmight have left us feeling cheated as we did in a game of Wellington, which employs the same Peace Roll mechanic. In that game there was a French first-turn win after perhaps the worst French turn ever played.  I like the idea of the game ending sooner rather than later, so that an early push-your-luck game has a chance to win, but unfortunately, 6 on a 1d6 is the base chance of peace breaking-out no matter what the syles of play used.

This game would break a 9 for me if the Peace Roll worked differently.

Overlong game that works as a multiplayer game but the resemblance to the Napoleonic wars is essentially incidental.  The political system completely fails to capture any feel of the revulsion Napoleon caused in the ruling dynasties of Europe. Likewise, the anti-French nationalist feelings that were essentially a prerequisite to any of the old regimes being able to stand up to the French after multiple failures are completely absent (well, there are a couple of cards with one-impulse effects that are sort of intended to represent this but fail).  Prussia could as easily end up in the French camp as on the other side.  Britain is not interested in a continental balance of power but in cutting out the biggest slice of real estate on the continent for itself, like any of the others.

On the military side, though the repeated historical one-or two year campaigns are possible, the game also appears to support a "perpetual war" approach where participants simply keep fighting across a featureless flow of one year after the other.  

Summary: yes, a similarity to the Napoleonic wars can be discerned, though more in the components and map than in gameplay. 

Final comment: rather funny to see War and Peace (where Europe was almost a featureless plain equally traversable in all directions) being followed by game whose map is bizarre in leaving out major trade routes and roads all across central Europe to make moves more constricted.

P.S. I don't see why the second edition needed a separate entry.

One play (4 players) - Russia was a winner. 

Game ended after just 2 turns. Some people find it annoying that the game can end so rapidly but it also gives some flavour: each player in the Coalition has a "arch-enemy", France. But also each other partner within the coalition is a rival. Each turn can be the last one and only single power can be a winner - so, one needs to keep an eye on the allies as well not to allow them to grow too much...

I was worried after my first play - the game dragged and Austria and Prussia spent half the game, which only lasted 2 turns, twiddling their thumbs. The mechanic requiring a conquered nation to sit out a turn is crucial to the design, but can lead to some odd experiences for players in games that don't last very long. HOWEVER - this game is a BLAST and offers more variability than you would think. In my third game turns 4 and 5 witnessed a French-Russian-Prussian alliance against Austria of all people (sadly that was me). I really like the bucket-of-dice combat system as it is both dramatic and affords the smaller force a chance at victory.

After 5 plays, once as each power, I'm upping this to a 10.

In six games: 2 French wins, 3 Russia, 1 Britain, 1 Prussia, 0 Austria

Excellent multi-player game of everyone pile up on France.  This allows a new player (as I was) to pick up the game by osmosis playing Russia and working with Austria to start.

No point in waiting for the decisive blow, instead continual attacks to reduce forces that recover at the end of the year.

I'd take the designer's War and Peace any day over this.

Played a few partial/full games. Initial impressions--UK too vulnerable, Russia not vulnerable enough. Spain not so tempting for Boney, since there is no Continental System to enforce. French navy seems too powerful. Prussia too "neutral" as a non-player power. In essence, the political simulation can be wanting, and it's too long and complex a game for what it offers. I think it probably works best as a three-player, Fr vs UK vs Aus/Rus.  

And this game more than any other makes it clear that I don't like games between wildly asymmetric powers. There seems to be potential also for one of the powers to side with France and hence virtually assure France comes out on top, with that power second, leaving the rest in the dirt. 

Leaders could be more nuanced, with special abilities or something. Cards do add some nice color and it is fun looking over Europe with all those various powers licking their chops.

I love the game, even though I've yet to see players switch camps .. usually things boil down to 'everyone vs France', no matter who's actually about to win VP wise. So I guess with the right people to play with the game would easily be an 8 or even 9 for me.

In its time it was the best card-driven war game.  

The chrome and reasonably elegant rules will mean that NW has a special place in my heart.

Though I think that this representation of coalition warfare is fascinating, I still actually think that "Age of Napoleon" captures the "spirit" of the conflict better. This period really was Europe versus Napoleon.  NW is more flexible than actual history was . . . . 

Still, "bicorne" hats-off to McLaughlin!

[1 play] There are some cool things going on in this game, and I definitely enjoyed the group experience and the good old fashioned multiplayer war game. However, the downfalls for me rating it higher are: 

1. complexity and downtime with both rules look-ups and inaction between turns for all but the French and British player.

2. The real dragging potential for kingmaking or bash the leader

3. The length of rules explanation and the overall length of the game potentially going 14 hours.

My "favourite" historical figure, "favourite" series of wars, in a format I love since first playing Hannibal. Great game, solo, with two or more.

Very interesting extremely asymmetric CDG whereby different nations are far more powerful or weaker than their counter parts and have vastly different victory expectations.

The alliance system is very interesting and definitely fits the time period of the game.  

The semi random ending of the game can lead to big swings in play time but it also adds a sense of urgency to the game.

Like all CDGs a knowledge of the deck can be extremely helpful.

One thing to note is that some players, mainly the French get to do a ton of stuff, others get significantly less impulses.  Just beware that some players may feel like they don't get to "do anything", but that simply fits the theme.  Also it allows more experienced players to play the French while new players can get into the pool slowly with Prussia.

I would rate this higher if the rule book wasn't so poor. 

I only decided to put the effort into learning this game because many of my gaming friends rave about it. I'm glad I did. It's a very interactive and tense game with wild swings in fortune. The allies are against France but really in it for themselves and the way the game creates this and the tension it causes is excellent.

Another multiplayer game using the card driven system.   Fun game which can be won by either the French or the Allies.  France can get Prussia to switch sides with the right enticements.  Naval and land war at the strategic level.

Big and complex card driven Mediterranean conflict.  First attempt did not improve my opinion of War Simulation gaming (at Matt's apartment in Simsbury, with Brian and Kevin.)

I've owned the original TNW for about 7 years now and have only played a few times, largely shorter scenarios for loack of opponents and time. This year though (2012) for our new years games bash we nominated this, as well as few others for play.

The game can be very long, it is about 4-5 turns, with eaach full turn taking 2-3 hours (faster if you're a pro). Sayiing that the cards are full of flavour and you do all the bizarre stuff that happened in the napoleonic wars, as well as a few other things!  :)  The time flew past when we played and everyone was amazed at how long we had been playing as we were all immersed in the events, the game, the interplay and the funny and quirky events that the dice brought us. Highly recommended but put aside a good slice of time. It can drag a bit if you are being beaten up, eg Austrians, or French later but hang in there!  :)

Thumbs up.

Just played this for the first time. Two player game getting ready to teach a third once we have the rules down. Looks like it's going to be pretty good. Was received well. looking forward to more of this.

*update*

This game is well worth the effort to really learn.......it's awesome.

A card-driven wargame (with plenty of dice). It involves diplomacy, as countries form coalitions. Countries have different regions and strengths. Also, countries can attempt to ally with neutral nations for additional help. Each game can play out completely differently depending on the cards/players/strategies.

Need to play again to understand it better.

Don't know when I will get four players together, so it might go unplayed for a while.  I'm a sucker for all things Napoleon.

This game seemed a bit wierd on my first play. The map was not as bad as I was expecting, even though I don't like "molecule" maps. The color of the pieces was fine, but the art seemed to give no gravitas to a huge bloody conflict. The role for game end at the end of each turn also removed a lot of the gravitas of what should have been an epic series of wars. The combat was OK. But, as one of the non-French players, I felt like I never had enough cards to accomplish much.  Maybe this would be better as a 2 player game.

Bottom line: I won't be disappointed if I never play this game again. I will play other CDGs. And for muli-player Napoleonic fantasy, I'll stick with Empires in Arms.

Goes up to a 9 after exposure to the scenario mode, which presents a very different take on victory conditions. Played the 1812 one; France has to press towards St Petersburg while Wellington threatens a takeover 'back home'. Great dynamics, and a great challenge for the French player.

Interesting multiplayer. So far only exposure with 3 players, so can't say if it only shines with 4 (or 5). Certainly there's less interaction and less shifting in the alliances with 3.

Mechanically this feels very, very similar to Sword of Rome, with some of the latter's (endearing) oddities stripped out (like plundering cities and paying greedy generals). 

Very unsure which of the two I like better, as here all the armies feel rather same-y, so location and logistics are the decisive factors, making the game overall more amenable to planning. Still, few of these plans survive entirely intact once they make contact with the combat system. The size of the dice pools are considerably larger here, which is a rather mixed blessing.

My war game groups most played game, yes it isn't historical accurate, and luck does swing this game a lot, but it is just fun. The game rules are not difficult and all and it not to bad to introduce to new players.

These games have become a cornerstone for our gaming group, whenever we want a multiplayer game this and Napoleonic's Wars are always suggested.

You need loads of time for this. The gameplay can take long and you need regular sessions to first get all the rules down and  then the tactics. For that, you also need a steady crew devoted to play this on a regular basis, short intervals. If that was all possible in my life, I would rate the game higher. Regrettably, for me it is not.

RATING: 6.5
Elegant low-density counter, GBoH look-a-like wargame system. Good period feel and fast playing once you are familiar with the rules. Finally a wargame system where it is recommended to keep the lines closed. That makes the order of battle of the beautiful counters looks beautiful on the also beautiful map.
However some rules are unnecessary complicated, for example you keep track of both formation and morale. Also features of the landscape are annoying. They mess up your lines.

Comments from Mike in my gaming group, a former ECW reenactor: "This game portrays how things would have progressed better than any other I've seen."

System plays very cleanly.  Whenever questions arise, there of the "wonder why he did it that way" nature and not "how does that work."  Refreshing for a wargame of moderate complexity.

Great game, great system. Only partial control of troops due to Wing Orders rules. Good for solitaire play as a result. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The heart of this game is the command system. Each army is divided into wings, each of which is under a particular order; those orders impose restrictions upon unit actions and cannot always be changed at will. The command system also bears similarity to Berg's Great Battles of History, in that wing leaders can attempt to activate their commands more than once per turn, and can also attempt to pre-empt opposing leaders. This leads to a game where the players must make careful decisions about when and how to use their units to the best advantage.

There are a few downsides. Some of the battles feel a little constricted in choice and may lack replay desirability. There are plenty of modifiers to calculate in combat (but nowhere near as many as GBoH, for example), and at times it can feel as though one is rolling dice simply to go through the motions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.6
Got my a$$ handed to me in the Edgehill scenario.  Of course, the fellow was generous enough to teach me as we played, but the trouncing I took was humiliating.  Technically, the game isn't over, yet - but I've lost 15 units to his ZERO.  This is a game system that rewards knowledge of the minutiae in the rules, something that I am not so sure I'm willing to do.  This was my third experience with the game, and I have been thrubbed heartily every time.  I am one of those players that only let's a mule kick me so many times in a row before I give up on the mule and put it down.

UPDATE 11/30/2011 - I'm getting the hang of the system little by little.  I played two more games (not of TACW), and won both.  Once the game system is properly grasped, it flows pretty well.  Additionally, VASSAL live with the use of Skype is an excellent way to cut down on the fiddliness factor.

Thus far I've played the Edgehill, Naseby & Marston Moor scenarios, and this one is a winner. Managing chaos is definately the thrust of this system, and it is entirely delicious to suffer through all the problems and opportunities in this game. 

Note that this is a game which has a few wrinkles: stacks of chits to mark cohesion and morale and ammunition. Also a variable amount of actions for commanders, and an interactive turn which can be interrupted by opponents. But all this overhead is worth the payoff! Patient and decisive cavalry actions will oft win the day!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Brilliant system.  Really like the way your units fall apart in three different ways: morale, cohesion and casualties.  Quality Commanders matter, but do not dominate the game as in GBoH.  Orders that prove sticky when they are inconvenient, success that disorders your army, and sharp, decisive encounters in Close Combat give the game its paradoxical charm:  Linear combat for Chaos gamers.

Messy messy game.  You can have up to 4 different statuses indicated by different counters on 1 unit (ie. a stack of 3 or 4 counters often occurs)! And when each of those counters is tiny and you have to flip them and/or read them to get or record every piece of info about every single unit...well, like I said messy!  Also, the units don't do what you tell them to, nor stay where you want! (oops, off go the cavalry chasing broken troops...but that's a fun part I suppose).  It seems like quite a good simulation, but as a playable game, well...I don't know...I suppose that's why I don't like hex n counter games much.  Still I find the historical events very interesting...so my rating will seem high considering the "bashing" I just handed it.

I like this game. To me it seems like once you are engaged it is like watching two armies fall apart and the challenge is to keep yours from disintegrating first! (of course this could just be my style of play).
The orders system (needing to roll to change orders) works very well often leaving you missing that crucial chance to deliver the decisive blow.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is an excellent game system which I have had a lot of fun playing.  The activation/orders method works very well in conjunction with the system's triplet of morale, formation and casualty.  The system nice captures a lot of the unique flavor of the period.

A good mix of tactical detail, command and control and simplicity The simple command chit system forces you to plan ahead.  The game rewards the proper use of reserves. Timing is also an important skill in this game. A line of fresh troops charging into the enemy's tired and worn out formations will often  bring victory to your side. I like the Swedish Volume a little better because of the variety in the forces there....

I like it a great deal - there's enough decision making to keep players involved while not raising suspictions of excessive micromanagement of who's doing what.  The different types of damage (morale, formation and casualties) sound tough to execute, but give a really good feel for the different ways units broke down in action.  It *is* a complex game though and works much better played between two experienced players than solitaire.  

I also wish the command system contained a little more chaos (leaders need to be more impetuous) and handled detachments of troops a little better.

Raised my rating a point after a recent playing of Rocroi, which reminded me just how well Musket & Pike works for linear battles.

Almost there... the command feels right for this era and once a wing starts to fall apart takes time to reorder but it all gets a bit too fiddly with all of the status type markers and ammo. The game bogs down fast when you get a few assault combats going with all of the chits and continuation and preemptive attempts. 

Big units just vapourize and the hit points almost seemed pointless.

Ben Hull's Musket and Pike series may be the best grand tactical battle system being published today. Mr. Hull Knows His Stuff. The game mechanics are closely and explicitly correlated with period tactics; everything is there for a reason. You don't need to be an afficienado of this often neglected era in military history to enjoy the games, which have the potential to generate the same kind of spontaneous battlefield narratives as lower-level tactical games like ASL.

Rating based on only one play so far (Edgehill scenario).

Interesting system with GBOH influences.  Good battle field perspective and feel for the period.  Difficult to change orders, lots of command friction.  Cavalry leaving the field in pursuit of routed forces is probably realistic, but very annoying.

Need to play this system several more times to firm up rating.

After three solo plays, I consider this to be one of the best GMT games I've played and one of the best games over all I've ever played. The rules are very well written, the scenarios are well balanced and interesting. The components are very good (the maps are little plain, but still well made). However, the twenty turn scenario is just too long for one sitting and the rules for scenario three are a bit confusing. But, overall, the game is just fun.

You'd never think that the relatively simplistic tactics of the period could provide the setting for a good replayable game.  But you'd be wrong, and this game proves that.  With surprisingly simple rules and straightforward sequence of play, Ben still maintains the feel of the era.  Battles swing back and forth, cavalry gets carried away chasing routed troops, and everything else you'd expect from this period of tactical transition.

I'd give this one a 9 or 10, except that the other games in the series are better than this entry.  So they get the higher marks.

I love the whole period around the Civil Wars, and this game gives a decent recreation of the battles of the period. Cavalry are very hard to control, and a bit of a one-shot weapon in the case of the Royalists, while infantry are very hard to break in a frontal attack and artillery aren't that effective. Not too sure about re-playability, as there are four battles included in the box (and Cheriton came with an issue of C3i), but would you play each more than once or twice?

RATING: 5
TACW has many simple mechanisms but there's a feeling that the game is a little overlarded with detail given the multiple statuses for units. The division of forces into wings is interesting but there's the suspicion that the player has too much control over each of the wings and that to a certain extent when armies of this era are lined up and launched, you couldn't do much more than sit back and watch what happens. Close combats are frighteningly powerful and may be over-egged. Other than that it plays reasonably swiftly and there's some fun to be had as the armies grind down, out of control.

Only Edgehill played twice so far. It is fiddly, no doubt, and viscous, but it does flow. And due to its pace and the various markers and statuses, the value of each unit weighs heavily on your mind as you attempt to harass with cavalry, salvo, and push pikes in your favor.

2nd Newbury and Naseby also played. I'm not sure how the Royalist can hold off the Parliament as they did at the real 2nd Newbury. Methinks the bird's eye view of the whole affair makes it too easy for the Parliament--such is tactical boardgaming. Naseby seemed more enjoyable.

I wish the leaders had more color--special abilities or something!--and find it odd that reforming must be done by ACs and WCs, not lower-lever officers. I also find LI to be underpowered and the battle to drag on seemingly longer than it would in real life--the wings do not break unless all the units have suffered, and that to me does not seem realistic since troops often fled even when fresh. 

Also, note this pertinent comment from KlaytonZ: Big units just vapourize and the hit points almost seemed pointless. Why is fire always hit points, clashes something else? 

I also find the order the wings are activated problematic--if one is charging and one making ready, why will the charging always move first when it would in reality be simultaneous? The two statuses are interesting, but make things marker heavy. I almost think the system was better in its earlier incarnation, Paris vaut bien une masse! 

Still not sure what to make of the whole thing, but this game certainly makes it clear that simulating on-field interactions between troops is no easy thing without major abstractions. I wish there were a few more abstractions in this design.

[MPBS]
A lot of sound and fury, signifying mostly large stacks of markers.  I finally know HOW to play, but not how to play WELL.  The command system is what makes it all work for me.

UPDATE JUNE 2012
I keep coming back to MPBS.  It's not a perfect game; there are wrinkly bits in resolving Charge orders, the rules seem a bit frayed on the edges, and some scenarios do a poor job of leading strategy with the victory conditions.

But ultimately none of that matters, because MPBS fulfills the best promises of wargames as time-machines -- the historical model is so well represented and expressed in the mechanics, and I still learn something every time I play (up to over a dozen plays of the various modules by now).  It's a riot with a strong narrative, loads of replayability even of one battle, the right amount of chaos and things spinning out of control...  And even with all the markers, it's still fun.

Played the DTP, then on to the GMT version. GBOH-like system necessitates a very steep learning curve. Some fun, but I am concerned on how the system continues to evolve into more and more complexity (there are a plethora of special cases, each of which has to be addressed). 

Some design abstractions would benefit the series as a whole, both in playability and popularity. But the designer has a vision, and he's sticking to it (which I can certainly respect).

Great flavor, it requires fortitude to play correctly - even a decade later, I'm still not always sure what I'm doing!

I played once FtF on Feb. 2008.
In TACW,Cav.pursuit triggered the disappearance of Cav. himself more often than other games in the series(cf.A game of ACW 1st Bull Run)."Ohtto! my offensive Cavalrymen have disappeared!so,I'll order step-lossed Cav. to charge with Momentum next time."(...but It doesn't go to the melon...).
A pistol bullet limitation is slightly 'gamey',but mutually competing for the correction value is enjoyable even though it is not so big(+1 per 1 unit),especially,for the defense side.
King Charles is worth 50VP! I got it by chance...Checkmate king to...This is..
Overall , I felt the Edgehill somewhat "evergreen senario".

Not many tactical English Civil War wargames are made. This is THE best simulation available in my view. Highly enjoyable and not too bad to learn, nothing like complexity of La Bataille. This is one of my all time favourite games ever and I always enjoy going back to it. Please see my unboxing videos and play through for more details on this game. Musket and Pike fans will love this game.

This is an impressively historical game - you really get a feel for the various command and maneuver difficulties of the period. The game does a good job addressing enough of the finer details (e.g. facing, pistol ammo, unit status) to feel properly "tactical" without those details detracting from the larger issues of command and control and effective use of combined arms. The system's ancestry in the GBoH series is evident, especially in the command system. But, unlike the GBoH games, Musket and Pike uses a true series rulebook which is much more tightly written and edited. In this sense, M&P is much more playable than GBoH.

Still, I'm a little surprised at the frequent descriptions I hear of this series as "fast-playing". There are a lot of decisions to be made, some of them quite subtle, lots of counters to fiddle with, and sometimes just lots of units to move. To me, this is definitely a "weekend afternoon" game and not a "weekday evening" game.

But overall, I like this game a lot. It's playable, given its depth, provides a great narrative, and covers a topic that hasn't been done to death by mainstream wargames. If you're at all interested in the time period, or think you maybe could be, pick this one up while you can because it's going to be awfully hard to find in the future.

Update: Whether it's because my life has gotten busier or because there are now so many competitors with modernized mechanics, I've found it harder and harder to drum up the enthusiasm for old school hex-and-counter fare like this. Dropped rating to a 6. I can't say my opinion of the game has really changed, but when it comes down to it I'd prefer to play something faster and less fussy.

Lovingly and finely detailed simulation of English Civil War battles. The orders system is novel and key.

Táctico muy interesante. Activación por alas. cierta complicación con las reacciones, pero le da unas posibilidades muy interesantes.

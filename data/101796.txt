A simple game with a bunch of custom dice. Unfortunately it's just kinda boring. A pretty standard push-your-luck game...emphasis on the luck. Decisions are barely there. Most of the time you know exactly what you should do.

I'm very 'meh' on this one. I like the game, but as the basic rules are, it's very easy for one person to get lucky and basically run away with the game, leaving everyone else to just keep playing on their turn to either use every die or bust, as there would be no other way to catch up. Have yet to play it where this didn't happen, which makes for uninteresting gameplay. Wasn't impressed enough to try variations on it.

Light dice rolling push your luck game.  I didn't expect much after reading over the rules, but this game is pretty addictive - particularly since it's such a quick game.  My daughter loves it!

RATING: 6
Played once. It's fine! Five rounds felt a bit short, because the early rounds were pretty conservative, but once the score plus the cards resulted in people making riskier moves, it started to feel like the game it wants to be. With Can't Stop and Cosmic Wimpout both in my collection, I don't see any reason to add this, but I have no major complaints about it either.

Fantastic filler game, especially when yelling out "SUTAKKU!" when rolling the dice (apparently 'sutakku' means 'stack' in Japanese).  Purchased from a friend who wasn't seeing it get played much.  Lots of fun with this one.

This is a dice game I like, and is very reminiscent of Can't Stop. It plays in less time, about 5+ minutes. I played all 2-player games which seems about right--it plays up to 12, but I think there would be way too much down time since there is nothing you can do between turns--your turns depends entirely on the roll of the dice. 

I would like to own this. It is small to carry and takes little space to play--great for travel. It has its time and place.

This push-your-luck dice game is really just like yahtzee, but then a lot shorter and just a refreshing take on the classic. Easy to play, a fun, quick little dice game.

RATING: 6
Sutakku is a light-weight, push-your-luck dice game. The beautiful components are a pleasure to handle. The basic game (without the challenge cards) does not involve much thinking--your only decisions are whether to keep rolling and when to take a mulligan. We haven't played with the cards yet, so I can't describe their effects. 

This game is a nice addition to our collection of fun, fast games and compares favorably with others of its kind.

Light push-your-luck game. The Japanese labeled D6s will amuse or annoy depending on your attitude. Personally I would have preferred not to have to decode them, but without the special dice there's not much product here.

A simple, push your luck game which is less about stacking dice and more about rolling them, though you'll need to do both successfully in order to win.  I like it for what it is, but can't help but wish there was just a little bit more to it.

It's yet another quick, but bland push-your-luck game. Far from being Can't Stop. But much better than a game like Dungeon Roll.

A wildly random push-your-luck dice game using twelve normal dice, with not much in the way of tough decisions in the solo game and players being unequal in the multiplayer game. I'd choose Knizia's Decathlon for a better procedural framework.

Bought at Meeplemart.

The name gives all the wrong impression. Stacking the dice has nothing to do with the rules of the game.

I thought of much better set of rules that makes it more fun and competetive, especially in a pub-setting.

Gorgeous game. Not enough meat on the bones for me. I saw 'stacking' in the description and got excited. The stacking isn't really part of the game, though. It's just rolling dice and trying to roll progressively higher numbers, pushing your luck. Stupid impulse buy.

Sutakku is a simple dice rolling and stacking push your luck game. You will attempt to amass the most points over 5 rounds by following to key rules each round you must roll three dice and stack at least two and you can only stack on a number that is equal or more than the lowest stacked dice. Do you push your luck and hope to stack on a 5 or a 6 or just bank the points you already have? 

Simply push you luck that is fun and understandable for kids and adults alike, although not one you would play all the time.

RATING: 8
Light dice rolling push your luck game where players are trying to stack dice based on ascending numerical order in order to score points. 

Scoring is fairly static, whereby one great roll by a player can make them hard to beat. Feels a little Yahtzee-esque in the scoring but really nothing like it and other clones. 

Dice are gorgeous to look at with Japanese characters and large chunky dice. Playtime about 10 minutes.

I'll admit: I bought this game for the awesome dice. Though a fairly simple push your luck style game, I really like it for a few reasons. Of course, I love the dice. Their chunky and have kanji in place of pits. So cool! The tower of dice you build as you proceed through your turn is also neat and it's fun to tip it over before you pass the dice to the next player. I also really like the folktale included in the rulebook. The downtime is bearable in part because you get to watch another tower being formed and I really get into egging on my opponents to push their luck.

RATING: 6.8
A really fast filler in the push your luck style! It can be exciting to get a really great low roll initially, allowing you the potential to gross a lot of points. You can play this game completely with regular dice and a pencil and paper, but I really enjoy these nice hefty dice to play with.

Clean and fast press-your-luck that avoids some common traps of such games.  You can't bust right out of the gate, and the mulligan gives you some choices along the way.  Best of all, the bonus surrounding 5's and 6's gives you a reason to press your luck when the odds start to turn against you, which is good for a game like this.  Best of all, it is aesthetically pleasing to handle, roll, and stack the oversized dice.

I wish the rules were a bit simpler -- all the special cases are a tad too complex for younger kids and casual players, both groups who really want to join in when they see it.

It's a fine push-your-luck game. Could be easily played with regular dice, but the ones that come here are nice and chunky, and engraved with cool kanji numbers. 

Has some screw-you cards that we didn't want to play with...because they're screw-you cards.

There's not much to say about this game.  It's mostly multiplayer solitaire (unless you play with the included interrupt cards that you play on other players), and since the game doesn't have any rules about stacked dice falling, there's not even any point to stacking the dice.  It's a typical push-your-luck game where you have to roll three dice each turn and add two to your run, with the constraint being that each die you add must be equal to or higher than whatever's already in the stack.  You get bonus points for successfully pushing your luck when the top number is a 5 or a 6, but otherwise it's just a matter of deciding when to stop.  The game is cheap enough to get it just for the dice (nice and chunky, with engraved Japanese characters on the faces), but I wouldn't recommend getting it for the game itself.

I LOVE the Japanese language, people and culture and when I gained word this game was to be released, I anticipated it very much.

It is a very simple, highly luck-driven dice fest; however, I still find this filler game enjoyable!  There is some strategy involved as whether to continue rolling or to score, but all in all it is very dependent on how well a player rolls dice.  This will definitely turn some people off of the game, but those who enjoy rolling dice will find this small game satisfying.

The components are superb, especially the dice which come in their own printed cloth bag!  It is those little things that make all the difference.

RATING: 9.5
Played at GenCon50 and it was the best game I played all week, which is saying a lot because I played some fantastic games! Unfortunately, all copies were sold out by the time I played so I had to put it on my Christmas wish list. I was extremely happy to tear away the wrapping on this one and add it to my collection on Christmas morning. I really enjoy how the theme comes out in this one and really like the stress of trying to get in, get your artifact, and get out of the ship again without dying. It always seems that everyone is cruising along just fine and then, all of a sudden, people start dropping like flies. Loads of fun!

Pros:
Good game & well designed, 
The mechanics works well, no cards seems overcheated 
it's easy to understand, 
the game doesn't last for hours. 

Cons:
But in the end it is still a deck building game that we have seen THOUSAND of time with an additional ressource : mouvement (+"gold, +"weapon")
The board is confusing and horrible as hell...

RATING: N/A
It's funny to see and recognize all of the spoofs and references to space-age things.

The meta changed a lot, and it feels like there could be so much more tension due to everyone having tons of clank in the bag.  Unfortunately, the tension never really materialized in the game I played and it was really tough to try and get someone killed by the boss.  There were lots of ways to heal and due to everyone having 15-20 clank in the bag, the damage was spread out enough to not be threatening.

It was still a fun experience, but not completely better than the original Clank!

That being said, since I own and enjoy the original, I don't need to own this one.

My wife and I sat down to play a game of this recently, and ended up playing 6 games straight.  I find a lot more depth in this version than the original Clank.  This really surprised me as I didn't have any problems with lack of depth in the original. The faction cards for combos I was not expecting to like, but they work really well.

Every slight problem I have with the first one has been solved in this one:

- In the original, one player can make the game very short if they just blitz in and out.  This version requires the two datacubes to be placed first, which really helps keep the game at a more consistent length.

- In the original, playing later in turn order can really hurt as it will take awhile before the paths branch enough to allow you to get into un-looted places.  The turbo lifts allow you to get to unique parts of the ship MUCH faster, and those nooks and crannies are generally worth it for the better secrets and better data cube placement locations.

- In the original, one player could get lucky and get all the money cards.  This game has a lot more ways to make money.  Even if you didn't get a dime out of cards you draft, you can get enough to make a market purchase just by placing data cubes and making it to some of the money locations on the board. The removal of the backpack also helped this, as getting money early is less critical.

- In the original, it was very hard to cull your deck.  In this version you can cull your deck much more easily, there are more cards that do a better job of it.  Thisis very good since the different factions make having a culled deck more lucrative.

We were playing our two player games incorrectly by missing a rule where in two player you pull more cubes when one player is out of the game.  Our only nitpick was that the game didn't put enough pressure on the remaining player in a two player game.  I feel that playing it CORRECTLY (the rule IS in the manual, I just missed it) then this issue will be solved.  With 3 players I feel that the pressure to get out will be similarly strong as the original, because once TWO people are out, the third has VERY little time.  In a four player game I feel the pressure for everyone to get out will be much higher than the original Clank.

We have so far only played the two player game, so the above analysis is just my gut feel.

AMAZING game, even at 2.

Certainly much more challenging than basic Clank!; and the modular board is a very nice (albeit ugly and confusing) addition. Clank! In! Space! is a very, very good game; but its predecessor is light-years ahead of it overall. 

One major flaw with Clank! In! Space! is the end-game: after the first player escapes, the game can potentially continue for a very long time compared with the panic-to-escape that ensues in basic Clank when this happens. A minor flaw concerns movement: it is just so hard to move any distance in this version!

Clank! v1.5. Personally I don't like the theme or look as much as the original, but there are a few small changes that really improve the pacing of the game. I wouldn't say "fixed" because there is nothing wrong with Clank! But I prefer how In! Space! plays.

A full 10 for all the right reasons. I do not give 10s unless I mean it. Many improvements over original Clank! and now the game is even more streamlined, approachable, thematic, tantalising and exciting. You feel the importance of building your deck. The modular game board offers dozens of permutations. Happily I introduce this game to newbies and seasoned gamers as well.

RATING: 6
For an adventure game, the play was very solo, and very AP-prone. Sometimes we just sat there for 15 minutes between our turns waiting for something to happen. The module board still has the same in/out areas, and doesn't feel that unique (but is better than a static board). One plus is the epic feeling when running for the exit.

Takes everything that made Clank! great and expands on and adds to. The character cards are easier to obtain to have a larger deck and the dungeon cards are inspired by our favorite sci-fi movies and shows from Alien to Terminator to Star Trek and Star Wars to the fifth element. Very fun and enjoyable. Set up is a little time consuming but overall a great addition to the Clank! Family!

Preliminary review: Yet another 'Ascension with a board' deckbuilder, with all the same issues as any multi-currency, market row, cards = abilities and VP game. Can't even comment as to balance, as all but one player died in our playthrough. It works for what it is, but I don't want to play Ascension any more. I also don't understand the proliferation of the garbage 'combo with cards from this subset' mechanism.

This space version of the original "Clank!" adds a few new things. The board is modular, with double sided tiles that can be placed in different positions. The cards now have the possibility of belonging to a faction, and giving bonuses if you can play cards that have the matching faction symbol. There are teleporters, which require the purchase of a telepass from the market, and a rail system at the center of the board, both of which allow for faster travel and for players to spread more easily. Players must now hack two data terminals, each of which must be in a different section of the ship, before accessing the bosses section of the ship, where the artifacts are located.

I really like all of the changes and after one play, I can easily say I prefer this version to the original. The whole board makes more sense to me and paths are easier to see at a glance than in the original IMO. The whole game is reference filled and pun-tastic as well; one of the treasures is clearly the infinity gauntlet, the standard move card you can buy is called "boldly go", and there's even a card you can buy called nibbling beast that looks like nibbler from futurama. 

I also really like how the data ports seem to give the game a more defined timeframe. You can no longer rush in to the nearest treasure and rush out and end the game in 20 minutes. Also, the data ports each give you either a benefit or a punishment depending on which ones you use. The easiest ones to access cost you clank, so if you want to try to only go for fast ones, you will pay a bit, while some of the hardest to reach ones can heal you or even give you as much as 5 space bucks. This gives incentive to utilizing the movement options in the game to really explore tiles and get to the better data ports. Another reason I like the dataport system, is it delays the acquisition of treasures just enough that everyone is going to do some actual deck building. As stated earlier, in the original clank, a potential, albeit not terribly fun, strategy is to only acquire cards with boots, run to the closest treasure, and run out, and hope everyone else dies before escaping. Being speedy is still a legitimate strategy in CIS, but you will still have to do some exploring, deck building, and decision making along the way, which is usually enough to cause you to race for the higher point treasures rather than simply the the low treasures, which are still toward the end.

I'm excited for my other plays of CIS and it has more than likely put the original Clank in the tride pile.

PS. There is a card (something cat, or something like that) which is slightly more OP than the magic carpet in the original game, and so I highly recommend removing it.

I think i like Clank better. Money is too easy to come by and placing the data cubes just drags out the game and usually give you more money. Once you make it deep enough to get an artifact there is no pressure to get out. Just use a telepad or the wonkevator thing (even if its closed at the end it gets you quite a ways out. I know you need a key at some point on this thing too, but as stated above lots of money means you probably have a key). I would like to see the faction card boosts applied and modular boards in an expansion for Clank. All bitching aside i still like this game and it is a solid 7.

I suspect I'm in the minority, but I find Clank! (especially with Sunken Treasures) to be a superior experience to In! Space!.

The biggest improvement in Space Clank is the card faction mechanic. It adds a extra layer of decision making with minimal rules.

The red cubes that affect everyone's health and the new rules surrounding the endgame are interesting, but I'm not convinced they're a cut and dry improvement.

The modular board is cool in theory, but in the end it doesn't feel incredibly consequential. I'd much rather slap down one of the two finely tuned sunken treasure maps than spend an extra few minutes putting together In! Space!'s modular board.

Ultimately the added depth Clank! In! Space! is minimal and is does not justify the additional game length. In! Space! is a mostly lateral move in terms of quality at the cost of an extra 45 - 60 minutes.

Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure is one of my favorite games, it pretty much reignited my love up deck builders. When Clank! In! Space! was announced I was both excited and apprehensive. I was looking forward to new content and ideas but I was worried that the new would not live up to the old... And to some extent I was right. While Clank! In! Space! uses most of the same mechanics as the original it adds in some new things that don't add a whole lot to the game and in some cases actually detract from the experience. I'm not sure when I'd ever pick this over the original.

Getting chased by a furious dragon is way better than getting shot at by some miscellaneous alien warlord. This is the only advantage held by the original Clank! over this upgraded sci-fi sequel. Possibly also the expansions (which may never come for Clank! In! Space!), but I haven't played those and can't comment on them.

Better than Clank! More ways of trashing starter cards, more interesting cardplay. The genre references/parody is more pronounced and more pleasing.

Different enough from the original clank to keep both.  Seems to be good replay with the multi-sided modules.

My main quibble here is that designers hardly changed the feel of the game to adapt to a space theme. The clank! mechanic fits seamlessly in thieves stealing loot from a sleeping dragon. Not so much with space thieves hacking an alien overlord. Feels like a missed opportunity to rethink something from the original game. 

That said, this does use deckbuilding very successfully in a move-and-interact-exploration game. Better so than similar but too-open-ended Mage Knight. 

Also the hurry-up-and-get-the-loot-we-gotta-get-out-of-here is perfect, all the players in the initial games ended up damaged and barely escaping!

I had this to say about Clank

"Clank is a push-your-luck, ascension-style deckbuilding game where you have a few resources to manage: health, clank, money, attack, movement, and purchase power. Players will be traversing a point-to-point map using movement points from their deck. Moving from point-to-point may require a key or sword if you don't want to take damage. Along the way you'll come across merchants, randomized face-down tokens, and artifacts. Artifacts are the main purpose of the dungeon delving. If a player managers to get an artifact and get back out of the dungeon, they will receive bonus points and trigger the end game. The further you go in the dungeon, the more points the artifacts are worth, but if you don't make it above ground at the end of the game, you are eliminated. Player's purchasing cards from the central deck can trigger random attacks from the dragon. At which point all clank (cubes from all players in a pooled area) are added to a bag and a number of them are drawn and placed as damage. The frequency and severity of the attacks increase as the game continues and is at a fever pitch as people escape."

Pretty much all of this remains true for this sequel. What does it change? It's a lot harder to rush in, grab the cheapest artifact, run out, and hope everyone else dies. This is due to the fact that before you can access the area with the artifacts, you need to lay down two of your cubes on a terminal which will give you a one-time benefit or hindrance. People seem to like this feature. Additionally, parts of the map are modular which will greatly increase the replay value out of the box over the original game. A lot of people also like that this game has taken the 'faction deckbuilding' cues from games like Star Realms. Oh, and there is all of the 'hilarious' sci-fi parodies. I think a lot of people consider this vastly superior to the original Clank, except for one aspect: game duration. This game will take approximately 50% more time than the original, or at least the original 'basic board.' It's weird to have split the fanbase with two separate lines of products, but I guess quick+fantasy vs. balanced+scifi means that both can sit on the shelf for some gamers, or they can choose their preference.

As for my opinion, I wasn't overly fussy on Clank despite thinking it's definitely a respectable design. Then again, I'm not overly fussy on about 90% of deckbuilding games. Beyond that, while I do like some press-your-luck in games, I typically prefer games of that style to be an hour or less in game duration. Basically, I'm not the target audience for this game.

RATING: 7
The evil Lord Eradikus has all but conquered the galaxy and is now on a victory lap across the sector in his flagship, Eradikus Prime. He may rule with an iron grip, but his most prized artifacts are about to slip through his cyborg claws. You and your fellow thieves have challenged each other to sneak aboard his ship, hack your way into its command module, and steal from him.

Along the way, you'll recruit allies and snatch up extra loot. But one false step and — Clank! Careless noise draws the attention of Lord Eradikus. Hacking into his command module and stealing his artifacts increases his rage. You'd better hope your friends are louder than you are if you want to make it to an escape pod and get out alive...

Clank! In! Space! is built on the same game system as Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure, with players building a personal deck of cards throughout the course of the game, with the cards allowing them to move through the spaceship, attack things, acquire new cards, and — oh yeah — make noise to attract Lord Eradikus and potentially seal their own doom.

After falling in love with Clank!, Clank! In! Space! was iffy. I was afraid it would be too similar to the original game but the theme resonated with me a lot more and the modular board was a real draw. We now think this is better than the original Clank since there's a lot more to track and do that I think the original game doesn't have. Each game is a new experience. I wouldn't use this to teach someone who's new to Clank, but after they get a game under their belt this is what we pivot to.

I've wanted to try one of the Clank! games for a little while as I'm a fan of deckbuilding - but I didn't know that much more than that. I heard that Clank in Space was a bit more involved than the first one, so I thought it'd be a good one to try. What I liked were that cards were used for money, movement, fighting, and special actions, and that you were forced to play your whole hand (sometimes making noise *clank* that could eventually get you damage). It was sort of a light system but interesting how it worked together (even if it uses a less-interesting "Ascension" style of deckbuilding). And using the cards to move around a spaceship was also enjoyable (and I could see myself enjoying the theme of the original Clank more, adventuring across the land to a cave, or so I've heard).  Other than that, I can't say I really found anything else to really enjoy. The game is pretty ugly, and the luck of tile pulls, cube pulls, and card draws can be mitigated, but it still feels pretty chaotic. This is also a race game (interesting idea) that also has player elimination (BAD idea) and also the first player out sits around too.  A mechanic speeds the game up when a player dies or leaves the board in a very un-fun way for the remaining players and the players who are out. I think part of the appeal for this game is that you can die and that's supposed to be pretty funny. I didn't find it funny. I also found the card art and game overall to be ugly-looking. It can also be fiddly and overwrought.  Still, at its core it is a neat concept and I appreciated that. But otherwise, no thanks.

Excellent deck building heist game. Looks a little overwhelming at first but is very intuitive and easy to set up once you see it together. Modular board definitely keeps things fresh. My kids really enjoy it as well, the sense of urgency as the game goes on holds their attention.

This feels like what original Clank! should have been from the beginning. It's basically a balancing of Clank!. I like the modular board, the factions allow some balancing of the most OP cards in the original game and the force field guarding the artefacts as well as the general layout of the board makes the game flow a lot better in terms of movement. The fact that the starter decks don't start with as much movement and the Eradikus track's red guards also allow for better pacing, making the game much more intense in the end. The market items are also more interesting, which makes players even more diverse depending on who decides to go for which items. It also feels like the deck has more Eradikus attacks, which is balanced by them not being as dangerous in the beginning. This once again helps with the pacing and balancing of the game.

Light-medium deck building / racing (?) game.

RATING: 7
Clank is one of the great "heavy filler" games. There is plenty to tackle, and it is all very approachable and fun to do. Space Clank adds a focus in deck building by giving bonuses to like-colored cards when they appear. It also requires exploring on the entry level before venturing to the "depths" of the ship. Space Clank looses some of the fun push your luck, as most players will want the game to continue. However, the added ways to collect items and build a deck are welcome additions.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
It's fun and pleasant, but I'll be frank--deckbuilders to me are best when ~45 minutes or less (with notable exceptions like Mage Knight, where the deckbuilding is merely one element among many). This is doubly true for games where the market shifts randomly, so the vicissitudes of card draw are compounded.
Clank is considerably longer than the 60 minutes it claims, and as a result I feel it overstays its welcome rather more than I'd like. The endgame is also a bit wonky, insofar as it encourages player elimination and/or weird risk calculations that I don't find pleasing (though I'm admittedly hard-pressed to explain why I find the latter to be so).
Additionally, this game suffers badly in comparison to Quest for El Dorado, which I prefer in pretty much every way.

If you don't own Clank, definitely get THIS. The rule tweaks are small but good and the board changes are nice.
Essentially: "drop two flags in two of three different sectors" before grabbing an artifact (so you kind of know when a player is going to go for the grab-and-go), four different designated exits (one per player), and fiercer/more frequent boss/dragon attacks as more and more players leave.

I love it.  It's even better than original Clank! (and Sunken Treasures too).
The game is a bit longer, but this is fully justified and - what's more important - rewarded.

New mechanics (like hacking data ports/gaining an access code) make the game longer, but also more fun.
The map also contributes to longer games - the artifacts seem so distant now... (conveyor belt and telepads help but...).

I love other ideas too: 
- introducing faction symbols on cards which allow to activate some actions from other cards.  That's great.
- new types of items
- hunter cubes (which - when drawn - hurt all players)
- 4 _different_ one-use exits

The neutral point is earning more cash (and in much more easier way) compared to the original game.  In result the market becomes depleted and the real race to buy items transpires.  Something unthinkable in the original game.

Great reimplementation of Clank!  Kudos.

This game brings the best and basic concepts from Clank! and adds a new twist to them. I would compare it to expansion packs to Settlers of Catan as they play off of the original. Some people might love Cities and Knights but not Seafarers. I suspect that some people may not like Clank! In Space because it is just different enough from the original.

Slightly better than the original Clank.  The designer, who hit a home run with Clank, learned and improved on it - the sign of a great designer.  No longer can you just do a quick grab and run, you have to hack two modules first.  The thematic elements are great, as are the nods to sci-fi franchises all through the cards.   I can see this becoming a 10.

If you're going to buy just one of the Clank! games this is the one (I have them all). It's abstracted the theme from the original dungeon and the expanded underwater Atlantis to Space but the mechanics are cleaner while still familiar and the simple addition of a modular board adds tons of replayability.

RATING: 7
The best purpose for building a deck so far. Trains was the first game to link deck-building with movement on a board but Clank! In! Space! does it far more convincing and fun. Clank! In! Spaces! obliterates Trains if this hadn't been the case already before. Part of it is the Ascension / Star Realms principle of acquiring cards which I like better than the classic Dominion / Thunderstone approach. The other part is the narrative arch of exploring a spaceship with random loot and the push-your luck element through the danger of being caught when causing too much noise.

The easier alternative to Clank! In! Space! is The Quest for El Dorado which packs the principle into a family-friendly package. While Clank! In! Space! is more thematic and has a broader scope, El Dorado scores with its focused design and shorter length while still offering challenging gameplay. I can't draw the obvious comparison to its predecessor Clank! but the common opinion seems to be that it's an improvement. So no reason to seek out Clank!

Deckbuilding with a board: how interesting that sounds to you pretty much dictates what you'll think of the game. The story does not make as much sense for sci-fi as it does for fantasy, but the upgrades more than make up for it: the prisoner cards, the factions bonuses, the modular boards, the hack cubes, the elevator... I also like the sci-fi movie spoofs and allusions on the card, although some of them are much too subtle (the orange cat is supposed to be Chewie?)

A race game where you run into a spaceship get an artifact and get out as quickly as you can.  This is a big improvement on the original game in the series in that there is a variable setup.  You collect treasure on the way that helps you score well and survive.  You also can buy keys, teleport keys, trade goods, etc.  And you must place two items in locations that unlock the final module to get the artifact.  

I really like the game.  I would almost always play.  At the end you do have to watch for other players dying.  If they do, all they do is pull from the bag and that can kill you faster than you think.

Still not a bad experience, I'd certainly replay it to see it if has some replayability.

Feels like normal Clank!, one of my most-loved deckbuilders but with a twist for putting the data cubes in 2 different modules in the ship. The cards are very thematic and refer to other movies and books. Very enjoyable to read while waiting for your turn. It's a bit long for what it is, so I won't play this with 4 but with 2 and 3 players, highly recommended. The bounty hunters speed up the game as well.

This version of Clank! is better in every way from the first, except when it comes to the board. The board looks very drab and cluttered, but I do like that it leaves room for expansion modules. That being said, this is still Clank! - With all of its accomplishments and faults. The system is still as fun as ever, but the game still drags on a little longer than it ought to. This is why I prefer the game with two far and above all other player counts. So while the first fizzled out quickly for me, I think I'll hang onto this one in hopes that expansions allow more room for variety. That board though...so damn ugly.

[b]Clank! In! Space![/b]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]My comments on Clank! really cover Clank! In! Space! as well. While Clank In Space is a stand alone game it plays quite similar to Clank, similar to all the Ticket To Ride games all build on a central set of rules that receive some tweaks. 

The main differences come from the addition of factions, the tweaked Rage track for Lord Eradikus and the command modules. Some characters are now associated with a faction and will grant an additional ability that triggers if you've previously played a card with the same faction symbol. The Rage track for Lord Eradicus now adds additional hazards in addition to increasing the cube draw. There are now red mercenary cubes which damage everyone when they come out and then get put back into the clank area where they will be added back into the bag during the next attack. There is also a cardboard piece that gets placed on the board and blocks the easiest path to escape the ship. Finally the board has three separate sections with command modules, you have to place two command cubes, in separate sections, before you can enter the area with the artifacts. Those are the main differences, it's worth noting that the board is modular and different sections can be flipped over to a new side and arranged in a variety of ways. 

Clank In Space! is definitely longer than Clank! [i](it probably adds 10 minutes per player)[/i] which is mostly due to the command module mechanic, but I don't mind this it makes for a very tense game and eliminates the option to speed rush grabbing an artifact and getting out quick. You can get damaged quick in this game, we've never all died in Clank! below the depths, but we pulled it off in Clank In Space! We went from almost having no damage to all of us dying within few turns without any of us making it to the hanger.

If you're a huge fan of Clank I would recommend Clank In Space, there are enough differences for me to keep both in my collection. Especially since Dire Wolf is still supporting Clank! with expansions [i](the new [thing=245377]Clank! The Mummy's Curse expansion[/thing]
looks awesome).[/i] If you're new to Clank! then I really think it is going to come down to which theme you prefer. As expansions keep coming out for Clank! I think it will incorporate new mechanisms similar to how Clank In Space! changed things up.[/i]

Given I was disappointed in the original, I had fairly low expectations for this re-themed version and they were pretty much met. Turns feel so incremental that it feels like it takes forever to progress through the map - our 4 player game took over 90 minutes, which was way too long for an Ascension-style deck-builder. The luck of the cards in the draft is still squared by the bad luck of what cubes come out of the bag (the more of yours that come out, the closer you are to elimination), which in a game of this length feels inappropriate. The nail in the coffin is that turns just aren't that interesting. The game is ok to pass the time if something better isn’t to hand (the design is still solid and well executed for what it is), but I'd rather be playing something else.

J’aimais beaucoup le Clank original. Le mode solo avec l’application ajoutait à la rejouabilité.  Clank in space est définitivement meilleur sur le plan de la mécanique de jeu. Je préférerais le thème fantastique au thème de science-fiction, mais il fait la job quand même. L’ajout de combo de carte possible ajoute à la stratégie d’achat. Le mode solo venant d’être ajouté avec l’application m’a confirmé que je n’etais pas dans l’erreur de faire le switch.

So, the question: is this the better version of Clank!? Hard to tell. It certainly feels a bit more streamlined, but also has some little extra rules which are easily to forgot (like you have to put your datacubes in 2 different modules or have to stop from dizziness after using a teleport).  You certainly go deeper through the deck of adventure cards I have the impression, which makes this game really needs an expansion with (a lot) of extra cards fast. 
The main concern I have about this version is the gaming time. I've played games of Clank whom only took 30 minutes. As here you have to get an artefact before you can work your way out, 60 minutes will be about the minimum playing time I think, which makes it doesn't qualify for a quick game to end the evening with anymore.

So i'm not sure yet which is the better version and for the moment I give them the same score.

Love this game, the module boards, the assassin cubes, the market place. all of the game just feels so complete and whole, as though i had so many possibilities, and all of them would be a liable way of winning. my only  complaint would be the simplicity of the cards, but hopefully that will be fixed with expansions.

I love the cards alluding to a bunch of space tropes and movies, like Star Wars and Avatar and the vibe is always a lot of fun. The modular board was a bit disappointing since it wasn't fully modular though and sometimes feel like going back to a regular game of clank. Great experiment with trying modular boards though, but I think this is more like Clank 1.5 than a fully sequel

In some ways the simplicity of the original Clank! can be missed; however, there are a few more meatier decisions in this one. This one isn't as good as what I had hoped. My first game was with four players with the original Clank! and I had a blast. Clank in Space! has not wowed me at 2 players. This might just be a game that is better at higher player counts. I will have to experiment with this. Either way, this one is a good game.

True, this version is a bit deeper and more balanced, especially with the overlord/boss attack mechanic, but I think the art and mechanics were better suited for the fantasy theme. Some people will love this, but I was exhausted by the overload of cheesey sci-fi references on every single card. It is definitely still a good deck-builder, but I'm not convinced I needed to own both Clank titles.

If you like Clank's other versions, then there's a good chance that you will like this one. This is a deck building exploration game. You are moving around the passage ways, fighting the monsters you encounter, making minimal noise, and avoid taking damage. This version does add a little extra layer to base Clank where cards you obtain can be associated to certain factions and trigger bonus faction abilities when played with other cards of their same faction (similar to Star Realms/Hero Realms). This is a great addition. The characters on the cards are great and are silly spoof of well known sci-fi charaters/items. The board is pretty busy and tough to plan out your desired path too far in advance. I like the passcodes required to get into the area where the artifacts are, which will slow players from the run in and run out fast strategy. The end game rules when a player leaves are much more lenient as well though. They did away with the ramping up of cubes pulled and also with the automatic death on the 4th round after escape. I wish they would have made that worse rather than more forgiving.

Bought new from Shuttle Games at CotN. I was a bit disappointed that Renegade released this only one year after the original game as it's one of my favorites, but after playing it I think there is room for both in a collection.  I like the added steps of placing cubes in different sectors before you can grab an artifact.  Good game.

[2 plays]  Better than Clank! Not by leaps, you could pick your favorite based on theme and not go wrong, but I do think they have made some good refinements with this version. Really well done. See my comments on the original for an overall thought on this style of map movement deck builder.

This is my favorite deckbuilding board game. I have not played the original Clank!, though it is often suggested that Clank! In! Space! fixes many of the balance issues present in the original. I loved that the deckbuilding was meant to allow you to directly interact with the board. This is opposed to a game like Dominion, where despite all of the expansions, I found interacting with other players only through cards to much less exciting. Setting up for the first game was daunting. Fortunately, Clank! In! Space! is easy to pick up after only a round or two. I did very poorly my first two plays, yet still had a blast - the telltale sign of a good game, in my opinion.

The theme of Clank! In! Space! is weak, and the art is bad. I was very disappointed with this, as theme and aesthetics is very important to me. The gameplay made up for it!

This game is best with two or three people. In general, the time to play is a linear function of the number of players, which unfortunately means this game can run long with four people. Especially if any of them overthink their actions.

Fun game with a reasonable amount of skill for what it is. I like the 'clank' mechanism and the race to get your loot vs. trying to be quiet. Clank. Oops. The jokey Sci Fi humor is reasonably clever and brought smiles to my face but it's not so heavy handed that it overpowers the game. The biggest problem I have with the game is it's a bit too heavy (fiddly rules) for a gateway game but maybe too light for real gamers. I dunno, we'll see. So far it's fun.

This is an update to the game Clank! with a science fiction theme and a few changes to rules.

The main rules changes are that instead of being able to make a beeline for the treasure you need to first hack two areas to be able to cross into the area where the treasures are.  There is also a big change to how money works.  It is a lot more available now but instead of simply buying things from the market it is also worth points at game end.  There are a few other minor changes like different ways to move about the map and red cubes that enter the bag damaging everyone but they don't really mix up the formula in a huge way.

First I would say if you have Clank! I don't really see a reason to get this.  It really does feel like just a reskin of the same game despite the rules changes.  And I'm personally not a fan of the changes.  One of the nicest things about this take on a deck builder is the race/speed element.  And the locking off of half the map kind of takes away from that and slows the game down unnecessarily.

RATING: 9
Huge improvement over original Clank.

Streamlined and updated.
- More currency/credits production
- Market plays a bigger part due to the above and also because of locations across the board
- Can zip around the board using hyperlift and teleporters
- Additional effects on cards based on factions and other item dependencies add additional layer of strategy
- Much more balanced (e.g. tome gives 5 VPs instead of 7)
- Code/unlock mechanic prior to entering "the depths" is a nice thematic touch
- Lots of little thematic additions related to the boss (dragon) and airlocks and everything else make the game really thematically immersive unlike the original
- Nongeneric, unique meeple shapes
- End game boss cube draw mechanic is a huge, less clunky improvement over the original game
- More balanced cards and better card manipulation (i.e. drawing cards, trashing cards)

Only "criticisms" are intrinsic to deck-building as a genre itself. A bit of randomness in random deck arrangement and card draws. But any deck-builder will have those "negatives." 

Amazing game.

I'm not a fan of deck builders and this just feels like any other deck builder. Do the actions your hand lets you and then buy another card from the market. The ending of this game is problematic because the first person who makes it to an escape pod has to just wait for the other players to finish the game so there is a fair amount of down time at the end.

Birthday gift from wife 2017, fun game, wonder when an app will be released for it.   Games shines as you pursue relic items, but then it become just a race to leave the board to gain final points.   The really needs more of a threat factor as players run across the board to escape the ship, since combat is optional you can always choose to ignore it.  Still fun and if you like Clank it is simply more of the same.

Definitely has "more stuff" than regular Clank, but I see no reason to add this if you already have regular Clank. The modular board is nice for altering the path and preventing a known "most optimal" solution to each map. I feel like hacking the access doors is just an artificial timer on grabbing artifacts, and I don't really care for that. There also seems to be some quality control issue with the modular board bits being mashed up on the corners.

Obviously the variability in the board setup is nice. Also good are the teleports, the rapid build up in the villain's deadliness, the hacking cube bonuses, the new limits on market purchases, and the card bonuses for playing the same special coloured cards. The board's a little more boring, but the cards are humourous.

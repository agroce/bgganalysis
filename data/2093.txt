Grew up playing it and I absolutely love the game especially the feel and sounds of the tiles being thrown around.  The hard part is getting 4 people together, but with cantonese scoring I could play ALL night.

The only problem is getting a good group of players together.

As a Chinese, don't think many will turn down an invitation for this game. I usually play the Hong Kong version but also enjoy the Taiwan and Shanghai version, was well as the Japanese version (which, I only played on PCs, PSP or other game machines).
I'll rate it a "9" in the past but interest is deteriorating in comparison to boardgames since I noticed the world of boardgames (and BGG!)

I am but a beginner, so what do I know.  There's so much in this game if you want all the varaints.  I just played the basic Japanese game and enjoyed it.  It's more like rummy than anything else.  Perhaps my score will go up on further plays.  It's unlikely to go down.

I can't and won't rate "mahjong" in general because different versions (scoring rules) have very large differences in playability.
I'll rate Zung Jung (my set of house rules) 8, early Chinese Classical (the original game!) 7, late Chinese Classical 6, Japanese Classical 5 (strong bias towards easy sequence hands), Japanese Modern 4 (overly complex rules, multi-player solitaire), Hong Kong 4 (a bit dry, too much luck with self-draw), and any version which focuses on irregular hands a 2.

RATING: 7
Game of ancient charm. I like a lot the variation called The Great Chinese Wall to be played with rules similar to Rummy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple tile/set collection game with random and chaotic game play that boils down to luck in draw and other player dependency. 

Nice game for family gatherings as rules are minimal.

Enjoyable due to (most sets) solid tiles used, giving a sense of 'throwing something' for enjoyment or for anger management.

Enjoyable to others as its universally used as a'Chinese gambling game' as Poker is for westerners.

The dizzying choice of scoring systems gets me down a bit, but in essence it's a set collection game where you are rewarded for harder combinations.

The choice of scoring makes little difference to the flow of the game, so once you've learned the basic flow you can choose the method at your leisure.

EDIT: Zung Jung wins the score set battle for me.

RATING: 7
Classic set collection game for 4 players. One of the top "nice bits" games in my collection. The feel of a set of nice tiles just can't be surpassed. Due to the complexity of some of the special hands and several differing rule sets, you really need someone to teach you the game if you don't know how to play. But basically this is rummy with tiles and more complicated scoring.

Although this game get a bad reputation to me on an early age (It is a gambling game to me, and Hong Kong people played it with money). After I learned it and played it, I can say it has deep strategy in the game. It is also a very mathematical game (the point calculation, the propability calculation etc). All in all a good game. But I disagree with gambling with it...

One of my best classic game. Easy to learn. Look like rummy a bit. Settle the rules before playing. I think we&#039;re playing a chineese variation. No jokers, but we keep the flowers.

A Chinese tile game for 4 players that appears to be old but is in fact less than 150 years old, it has a very high degree of complextity and skill level needed to win consistently. The rules are not easy, but the number of special hands and tactical play (whether or not you are East Wind can affect this) and scoring ensures that there are many things to think about. I used to play this as a child a lot, and was left the family set where it occasionally gets played with. Certainly one of my all-time favourites that I could play over and over again.

An old classic, this Chinese game is really good to play. The rules appear easy on first sight, then you realize there is a fine balance inherent. Playing is almost a ritual, a meditation.
The rules are reminsicent of rummy, but again different, and you play with these wonderful pieces, not cards. It feels incredibly good to handle them. There are some beautifully designed versions around.
Playing Mahjong is always special somehow.

RATING: 8
Good game. In Asia one of the few titles where "non-gamers" (in the Geek's definition) such as Grandpa and Grandma can beat any "gamers" easily. The ultimate cooperative and competitive game in one. IMHO rating "Mahjong" is pointless due to the various versions -- it's like rating the "cards" instead of Poker/Bridge/Cribbage etc. =P. The rating 8 here reflects my general impression of the Guangdong-Hong Kong family (be it old, pure or new style). Somtimes it will be a bit long since it is a tradition in most versions to complete the game in multiples of four "winds".

This is one of my favorite games from the 80ies. I played it regulary with a group of 4 of my co-students. There is a special atmonsphere based on the bamboo stones and the ritual to setup the game.
The main problem is that it needs exactly 4 players to play.
With Ming (also called Mahjong the card game) I tried to solve the problem with the need for 4 players and a large table. But Ming is not the same stauff as Mahjong.
I really would like to play it again, but there is not much hope to find the other 3 players...

Das Spiel war DER Spiele-Favorit in CLZ, vor allem wegen der schönen Bambussteine und dem ganzen Drumherum, wie z.B. dem Aufbauen der Mauer, die Sache mit den Winden, den chinesischen Zeichen und der zum Explodieren neigenden Punkteabrechnung. Also viel Atmosphäre wenn man 4 Spieler gefunden hat. Das ist auch das Problem, man braucht genau 4 Spieler die sich von den chinesischen Zeichen nicht abschrecken lassen und schließlich braucht man noch einen großen (kratzfesten) Spieletisch.
Würde ich gerne wieder mal spielen. Bis dahin gibt es nur den Ersatz auf dem Tablet (die echte 4 Spielerversion und nicht die Dublettensammel-Solitairversion)

The first real game I purchased for myself. I learned how to play this when I was around 13 I think.
I haven't actually played a proper game for a long time, the 3 plays I've recorded here are the attempts to teach friends and only lasted a few hands.

2011-03 A few hands (8ish) with a friend and a couple she knows. Minor differences in scoring need to be determined before playing.

I used to play this a lot with my parents. Luck is too much a factor, and a full (four winds) game takes too long, for me to have much interest in it anymore. Still love the feel and smell of the components, though, as well as the feeling of 'ritual' surrounding the game.

My mother's side of the family plays this game frequently when they get together. Younger, I was not encouraged to learn the game because they played with money. Nowadays, my mother still has that set (those pieces are amazingly sturdy!) and she taught me and my kids how to play. It is frequently requested - and no, we don't play for money between ourselves ;-)

Although it’s not a bad game altogether, Mahjong is quite boring to play: in fact interaction is minimal and the whole strategy is nothing else than an educated guess. 

So far I’ve only played with the basic rules though so, should I include the full rules,  it’s likely my rating could change: whether upwards or downwards, that I don’t know.

Introduced to me by the wife and her family.  I can hold my own, I know how to pronounce the various tiles so I can call out which ones I discard.  I'm not very good, though, and I feel I tire of it quickly.  I can't play for hours like they can.

Note, there is strategy here, but whether you win or lose a hand can all be up to the tiles drawn.  This is a [i]gambling[/i] game, and like other gambling games luck plays too strong a role to enjoy much when money's not involved.

Básicamente, el juego consiste en ir construyendo combinaciones de fichas (ching, pong o kong) hasta conseguir tener combinadas un total de 14 (cuatro combinaciones de tres y una pareja, por ejemplo). Según el tipo de combinaciones que se obtenga, se otorga una una puntuación (faan) al jugador que ha conseguido el majhong. Dicho jugador es el único que puntúa.. y según la cantidad de faans obtenidas, sumará más o menos puntos. Además, los puntos que obtiene se le restan a sus adversarios, por lo que es común que haya puntuaciones negativas.

Ees bastante entretenido y fácil de jugar, aunque, como los buenos, difícil de dominar. Tiene bastante componente de suerte.... pero bueno, como la pueden tener otros juegos de naipes (chinchón, tute, por ejemplo). Y es que resulta que, aquí va la nota cultural de la noche, el majhong es realmente un juego de cartas, solo que las cartas tienen un grosor considerable. Hay muchísimas presentaciones del juego, en distintos materiales y tamaños. L

Las piezas corresponde a tres palos (caracteres, discos y bambúes) o a una de cuatro posibles categorías de honores (dragones, vientos, estaciones y flores). De cada ficha hay cuatro copias en juego... y las combinaciones aceptadas son el ching (es una escalera), el pong (tres fichas iguales) o el kong (cuatro fichas iguales).

I love Mah Jongg.  It's a beautiful game, it truly is.  If it has any flaws, they are that it's a long game and the scoring can be a bit bewildering for some players (even if you don't bother with the silly American glory hands like Knitting the Nines or whatever) and it does take quite a while to play.  Very nice with a few glasses of red wine and Jethro Tull playing along in the background. :-)

Cool-looking rummy, but no more. I had fun in college playing this with the Chinese kids in my dorm, but it hasn't gotten much playtime since.

I play using the Zung Jung rules. I found them to be the most intuitive rule set of the ones I checked (I also looked at Cantonese and Shanghai), and were the easiest to explain. 

Having all the discarded tiles being out there, no reshuffles, and only getting one shot at a discarded tile create an atmosphere where you can really plan out your hand and know when to abandon it and go for something more likely.

And the combinations create many possibilities for each hand. It's not just a simple set collection game. There are so many available sets. Each hand has so many directions you can take it in.

My rating is for the single player Mahjong which I don't really see as a "game". At least, to me, it's not that interesting and like Solitaire you can actually make some decisions, when you have two options, which you have no impact on turns out to be wrong and you should have chosen the other option... That's not a sign of a good game I think. I haven't tried the multiplayer Mahjong.

Despite having been taught a version of mah jong as a child, and having relatives who have gone to Hong Kong mah jong schools to learn to play the game expertly, I never really learned any official set of rules or scoring.  My parents aren't gamers at all and play that the winner of a given game is the one who goes out first, which is a completely different beast from scored mah jong.  I'd like to play "real" mah jong (any scoring system, really) at some point.

The set I have was given to my parents and purchased in Hong Kong.  The tiles have bamboo backs, and tiles that might otherwise be confusing (the four winds, tiles of the "ten thousand" suit) are labeled in English as well.

I only play Hong Kong rules. Half the fun for me is the ceremonial aspects of the game, as well as using the proper names for things. It's a gambling game at heart, so being able to try for higher scoring hands is what makes the game intense and rewarding.

Whenever my sister and her husband are in town, this is all we play, since they're the only people I know who play it.

I played the other kind of mah-jong. The kind where you have a sort of pyramid where you have to unbuild it by removing pairs of the same suits. I'm not really familiar with the classical version of the game.

Edit: I've finally tried the TRUE version of Mah-Jongg. Veeeeeery different. Recognizing the values of the tiles is the hardest bit when you're totally unfamiliar with the game. The setup seems over the top, but people gamble over this game so true randomization is appreciated. But once the setup is made, it's quite reminiscent of most card games.

I have the authentic tiles and it makes the sounds of swosh and clang as the tiles are swishing around when you have 4 people playing it. Its a game of wits, concentration, and high stakes if you are gambling. Good game among the asian community.

The Game of Sparrows is a game of luck and some skill. The luck is readily apparent from the drawing of the rather mysterious tiles, at times beautifully engraved with indecipherable characters. The noise they make when shuffled is unmistakable, and although there is no need at all to construct the Wall, people do it anyway to give the game a more luxurious and serious appearance. The skill comes in from attempting to construct an as high a score as possible given that variable input, and some constraints shown to you by your fellow players. You can train this skill, and become better than other players. In case you were wondering why I say this: I've played about 1250 games in my life, at least half competitively, and can thus substantiate this claim rather easily. Unfortunately for me, the 'algorithm' in my head isn't particularly good, making me an average player at the very best.

After the discovery of modern boardgames I have rarely put Mah-Jongg on the table. Part of the reason is that I've grown out of the game, although I will still happily teach it to newcomers if they're interested. Another part is that the internationalisation of the game in recent years has pushed the traditional ways of scoring all the way to the background (there are no tournaments anymore featuring the rules I grew up with). Nowadays, most players play Riichi or Japanse Mah-Jongg, which features simpler scoring, which is perhaps farer too—the doubling aspect of the traditional rules could be absolutely murder due to nothing but sheer luck. But to me, it feels like Frankenstein has been at the game. I never bothered to learn Riichi, and even now while writing this comment I find reading through the official rulesets to be a hapless and uninteresting task.

Mah-Jongg is a hard game to rate, because it all depends on the set of rules and scoring you use. The way I was taught and played exclusively ('Chinese traditional') is, I think, not so good for serious play. The doubling factor can be absolute murder, and if I had a dime for all the grumbling and cheering I overheard because someone managed to score in excess of 5 doublings, I'd be able to purchase a shiny new set by now. For tournament play, these rules are not really fair. Also, the fact that a minimum of two doublings is imposed to make the game worthwhile for those who strive for a good hand instead of completing the hand as fast as possible, tells me that these scoring rules are less than optimal. A 5 is terribly harsh for a game I played that often, but given my lack of interest in the last few years...

[b]Update[/b] At one point I delved into the rule sets again, and could pinpoint [i]the[/i] core issue with all of them: they don't properly address the dichotomy between calling out Mah-Jongg quickly and building up a hand worth a sizable number of points. Were this issue to be fixed, Mah-Jongg would become a proper [i]game[/i], too.

Better than similar card games (like Poker).  A nice, varied form of betting/rummy which lots of different rulesets to choose from.  Ultimately, the one downside is that most Mah Jongg sets are quite pricey; I lucked into a good quality set made from resin that was being cleared out of a local game store.  Another downside is that a lot of sets often come out of Asia and have amazingly poor English instructions, although with the Internet, that's not too big a deal.

This is a great social game with a terrific aesthetic and atmosphere - also good as a family game including with children - my 7 (now 11) year old loves it.

There are almost as many ways to play it as there are tiles in a set - we play a version close to the original Chinese version as presented by the British Mah Jong rules. We don't use the jokers or flower and animal tiles, which I feel unnecessarily increase the luck in what is already a pretty random game.

Essentially the game is rummy (using tiles) on steroids - the steroids being the special hands. The skill and decision making is all around percentages and whether you go for a special or turn to convert to a convential Mah Jong hand.

The scoring is not entirely straight-forward - the traditional dotted sticks in particular just adding to the barriers to what is really a quite simple game. Once you know the basic fundamentals, feel free to amend to whatever shape you prefer the game to be.

This game is vaguely similar to gin rummy, but is played with "mystical" tiles instead of cards.  The rules are a quirky but aren't hard to learn.  A complete game would take about four hours to play, but you can still have fun playing a few rounds/hands and be satisfied.  Each round takes about 15 minutes.  Scoring is quite complicated, and can be very challenging for the beginner.

Because my wife and my parents like it so much, I've played it more than any other game in my collection, maybe 50 or 60 times.

Probably my favourite gambling game, after Texas Hold'em. How come this isn't listed under "Ma Jiang," the Mandarin Chinese name for the game? There are way more Mandarin speakers than Cantonese speakers, after all... (Also, I much prefer the mainland Chinese style over the Hong Kong variant.)

THis is a better version of Gin Rummey. I picked up a pretty decent tile size set in China for cheap. 

I now play this quite a lot, great relaxing, but deeply strategic abstract. Needs exactly 4 players though. We usually play Japanese scoring, which is complex but engaging. I use a simplified Chinese scoring system for teaching newbies though. Despite the random tile draw this game does ask a lot of questions of you, what hand am i trying to build? Are my discards revealing my strategy? Do i go for an easy low scoring hand and ruin other players chance to score, or do i try and get a big pay day?

High luck on initial draw. More luck on each turn's blind draw.  Fun if not too long, and you try variations of making "hands". Must adopt on the fly - so tactical. Talk about multiple pathways to victory! Ha!!! - this give loopholes for strategy.  Never play with 3. Best over 4 rounds (4 games each round).  Also depends which "style" (e.g HK, Tawianese .etc) scoring (thus strategy) can be drastically different.

I have only just added this to the games I own ... however I have owned this game for a number of years, ever since my eldest daughter, Emma, brought me back a set from China, where she was attending university in the south of China (Xiamen). Playing this resurrected all the game-playing feelings that had laid dormant for many years.  I realised that over the years I had always longed to play boardgames, and every year I used to buy 1 or 2 boardgames at Christmas as 'family games'.  I had not known about the wider world of gaming though, and only ever been able to buy mainstream Waddington or MB games for example.  The Christmas we played MJ with Emma was such a fun time ... I think we played non-stop for several days.  Even all the family members who weren't really gamers had a great time with this. I therefore searched for and found BGG!!!!! (I won't go into how much I have now spent on games!)

I love this game ... the click-clack of tiles, the random element, the tension as discards are played which you cannot get hold of, the change in turn order as other players claim discards .... 

Do not let anyone tell you that this is simply a gambling, pure-luck game.

It is fun fun fun all the way !!!

Jun 2007 I have changed this to a 10 ... because I would play this at any time, at the drop of a hat.... if only I could get more games in... sigh

[6 plays]  Learning to play Mahjong was a long-cherished dream for me, and I owned a set for over a decade before I ever got to use it.  Now I have finally gotten to play, and have gotten others in my circle fired up about it too, so the fun can continue.  We play Hong Kong style.  Right now we're all pretty novice, but I am looking forward to developing our expertise so we can play quickly and crushingly.

RATING: 6
I just don't have the patience for this classic. I can play 4 or 5 hands before the boredom becomes unbearable. To truly play the game with strategy it has to be done over a number of hands. You can't try to win every hand at any cost. You have to cultivate your potential winning hands while denying your opponents critical tiles. I will never be good at this game and I don't care. It's beautiful and I can see how it could be played quickly with a deep level of strategy and exciting tactics. But not for me.

I'm hanging on to it because I have a GORGEOUS set given to me by a friend.

Excelente juego para hacer apuestas y no solo eso, sino por sí solo ya es un muy buen juego.

Una de las complicaciones que hay es que existen tantas versiones que uno no sabe cuál aprender y jugar. Por mi parte, la versión que más interesante y divertida se me hizo fue la japonesa "Riichi".

Por otro lado, desde mi punto de vista, lo complicado está en conseguir a las cuatro personas que se requiere para jugarlo, por lo que la mejor opción es jugarlo en servidores de Internet como Tenhou o similares.

We played it slightly wrong the first three times. I would say that it has certainly more depth than you initially would think. On the other hand, the scoring is extreme, and also seemed very unbalanced (since you can multiply your score several times). The scoring is also very hard to grasp until you have played many times. It's really not my type of game, but I would play it again if asked.

This is a great game, but I often really need to be in the right mood to start playing. I always need a reference for the different patterns that are possible and I still haven't really figured out setup, counting, etc...always rely on others to take care of that when we play. Still, one you get started with Mahjong you just keep on going for a while - has the "one more game" vibe.

Don't trust the description - there's nothing like mah-jongg for money. Even penny ante is better than no ante at all. Haven't played mah-jongg seriously in a while, but it's easy to find a game at all-night house parties and funerals among the older people. Not something young people, especially gamers, play around these parts. I can still play the game, but see no reason to these days. There are some absolutely gorgeous mah-jongg sets out there. We had one carved out of jade that came in a felt-topped teakwood mah-jongg table (with money drawers and four beautifully-carved wooden cushioned seats).

Not dissimilar to the card game rummy at heart, but a few unique rules (especially for taking a tile out of turn) and the deliciously tactile feel of the tiles, makes Mah-Jong a highly sensual gaming experience. Certainly playable by two, but a far better game for 4.

I have a set that sadly has never been used.  Mahjong players aren't all that common it seems.  Four Winds Mahjong for the PC is excellent though and supports many rule variants.  I've played Chinese Classical and recently tried out Zung Jung 3.2.

Despite numerous playings on the PC, I just can't get past the perception that this is simply a rummy variant with more restrictions and special winning hands.  Most of the time after a few turns I know that the special hands are unattainable, and a few more dictate whether or not I play to win the hand or play defensively.  With that in mind, I like the CC rule set better because I can at least play to get some points even if I can't win the hand.

I'm sure I'll look at this again in a few months, as is the pattern for me.  I really want to like this more than I do, but can't tell you why.

RATING: 6
This game used to be a 10 for me, but it can only be a 10 in a very specific environment: you need to have significant money at stake and play with skilled players, all with an equal understanding that you play (x) rounds, etc., and you have the free time to invest in a long, long game. (Mahjong can easily go on for half a day, or a full day, or even longer.) It's a 4 without money and with unskilled players, just learning the game or "playing for fun." (Which isn't fun at all, and you're likely to be stuck in a lot of AP and going nowhere.) Like Poker, Mahjong is only any good when gambling is involved.

Cons:
- Requires 4 people of roughly same skill level. Otherwise, it's terrible.
- Will take a long time. (Maybe not a con, if you love it.) There have been many days when I've played MJ all day long and forgotten to do normal human things, like step outside and see the sun.
- Can bankrupt you, if you play with stakes higher than you ought to.
- Very noisy. If you live in an apartment complex, your neighbors will be very unhappy.
- Must use a square table.
- Must have a mat on the table.

It's been a long time since I pulled out a mahjong set, but it's given me some of the most epic gaming experiences (as only gambling games with serious, tangible stakes could). I don't see myself playing this again in the foreseeable future, but oh, if you have everything going with the right people, it's a glorious, amazing game.

Introduced to the game via Mhing, the card game version.  I currently own three different sets and will probably acquire a few more, because, quite frankly, Mah Jong sets rock!  I currently own three sets, but would trade for some more, especially a Japanese Riichi or decent American.  I own a rather heavy Hong Kong style Chinese set, a fairly nice Vietnamese style set, and the jewel in the crown, a Japanese set, a "Take."

Occasionally, my wife and I play with another couple who have caught the Riichi Mahjong bug.  Mostly, Judy and I play the game with two dummy hands so the four player game is kept intact.  Of course, the dummies never go out!  Our group started with Classical Chinese but found the scoring to be too unwieldy.

I would be interested in playing other versions including Hong Kong Old Style (HKOS), Zung Jung and American Mahjong.

[b]Mah Jong[/b][i] Classic chinese game 1850[/i]
I havent played Mah Jong a lot, I only know the rules but have no idea about how to score using the chinese or cantonese systems. So far it seems to me like a very tipical spanish card game called chinchón, but the beautiful tiles and the pace of the game make it ideal for chatting and relaxing while enjoying a match. It has to be played with four people of course, and I think the luck is way too important in this game, but I like it quite a bit.

It's hard to rate this.  Mah-Jong (however you spell it) is not one game.  There are dozens of varieties and at least 4 or 5 of them can claim to be major varieties.

I played this a lot as a kid. It was our go to family game. The set was absolutely gorgeous with bamboo backed ivory. It originally belonged to a great aunt who played regularly with a Chinese neighbour. Mum inherited it. And we learned to play it correctly to the chinese rules. Though we didn't gamble. Sadly my sister inherited that copy form my mother so we just have a plastic set and without the wooden racks which made building the walls so easy.

My wife never learned it so it sits gathering dust. Maybe one day it will come out again.

Very addictive classic. Has many scoring/rule variations which play very different. My rating 8.75 is for Chinese Official Rules, which I enjoy the most. Mahjong is more social than most other multiplayer board/card games. I also play some Riichi mahjong (I would rate it about 8.25), but I am novice at it. Zung Jung is also interesting, but even though I understand the reason for no minimum limit for a hand, I find playing pattern based scoring system with no minimum points bit frustrating.

My review on 4 Jan 2007:
http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/143698

Nothing brings my family together than a good game of Mah-Jongg!

The clicking and clacking of the shuffling tiles is very relaxing...that is, until you have to do battle with them!

There are many rule sets available, but we prefer the more skilled Chinese Official rules.  It prevents the game from becoming a dumbed-down rummy fest, but it also requires some commitment to learn the rules.

Below are some links to get you started :

RATING: 4
Ancient chinese betting game, where the draw is mostly its historical value.  It is close to Rummy, buit much less portable.  The fin side is building walls and moving the tiles around.

Drawbacks (bisides the weight) is the time it takes to pay bets at the end of the round, massive amounts of luck involved, and the sheer variety of rules.  DO NOT try to play by the printed rules... which were translated into english using a dictionary and not by an english speaker.  For example "The papentesis is the romanized" ?!?!?  

The only way to play this, like Bridge, is within a league or existing social group.  They will have their published rules and variations (or they should) and the play is more about socializing than the game.  If you travel to Asia, beware of joining any locals in this game without first knowing them very well!

I learned riich dora mahjong at an early age. It was great fun to play with the parents and other adults. When I got to graduate school, I sought out and bought my own set, and then taught some of my friends. When I started working, I taught a group of my co-worker friends. My friends were hooked on both times. This classic game strokes the competitive spirit, similar to poker, where players are trying to form the best hands, while trying to minimize losses from giving away the winning tile.

There are a multitude of different "styles" or "rules" depending on what country you are from. Like regional barbeque or pizza, everyone thinks their version is the best. It really boils down to the personal preference of each player, but rarely does one have the opportunity to experience different rule sets.

As far as Rummy-style shenanigans go, this one's tops.  The raw game inside is semi-mediocre—I'm not sure how much fun it would be with cards, for instance.  But those tiles make it!  Washing, building the walls, drawing stacks, arranging and monkeying around with them—it's a treat for the senses.*

Recommended as a social couples' game.

Really enjoying getting deeper into this game. Luck is much less of a factor than it appears to be. Nice combination of tactics, combinatorics, reading others, and risk balancing. Makes me want to dig out my discrete math textbook and run some numbers. 

Japanese "Riichi": learning but not mastered yet
World Series: my strongest game
American: fuck no
"Classical" (Americanized) Chinese: Easy to win by playing 100% defense and letting others dig themselves into a hole, which indicates how unbalanced the rules are. No.
Taiwanese: if there's a version that disallows zero-point hands I would play it. Doesn't seem to be though.
Filipino: I've only sort of played this version; bad initial impression but I'm willing to try again with someone who really knows the rules

Don't yet know HK, Chinese Official, or Singaporean rules, but I want to!

This is one of those games where random luck can have a big impact. Most of your hands of cards/tiles don't give you much points, and ones that give you a ton of points occationally pop up to give someone an obnoxiously high lead. Sure, there's a lot of strategic depth there, but the point system is almost always "broken" in nearly every version I've seen. I'm a fan of mathematical symetry and geometric perfection, and this game has neither. I rather play my "rummy-type" games elsewhere. With that said, there is a rich culture built up with this game. The enjoyment comes from playing it with people that enjoy it, not the mechanics of the game itself. As such, I can't call it a bad game, because I still have fun playing it.

Forse i materiali più belli in assoluto, tra tutti quelli dei giochi da tavoliere: le tessere d’avorio bianche, con gli intarsi giapponesi, ruotano e si mischiano sul tavolo - rigorosamente di legno - prima di procedere alla simbolica costruzione della grande muraglia. Poi il gioco in sé, è una specie di Machiavelli, quello che si gioca con le carte francesi. Ma le tessere, signori, quelle sono un’altra cosa.

1st played 2/25/08. Taught in ~5min, play length depends on goal pts. We played for ~1hr & 1 player had ~100 pts. Deal and play rotates counter-clockwise. 1st dealer is highest of 3 dice roll-off. Each of 4 players stacks 18 2-tiles in a line. Players push their lines together making a square. Players are designated North/East/South/West. Dealer rolls dice to determine how many stacks to right of his line he will deal tiles out. Starting w/ himself, he deals 4 tiles to each(3 times for 12 tiles). Each player gets 1 more tile w/ dealer getting 1 last tile. Each sorts their hand. The object for each hand is to get Mah-Jongg(MJ). MJ= 1 pair & 3 of any following combination: 3 of kind/Pung, 4 of kind/Kong, 3 tiles in a row/Chow. Tiles are in, suits (4 of each 3 suits 1-9), Winds (4 ea. N,E,S,W), Dragon, Honors, & bonus(flower/season). Drawing a bonus(worth 4 pts) gets you another tile from the wall's dead side. Dealer discards tile & all have opportunity to pick it up, if it gets you a Pung/Kong/MJ. Player's right can pick it up for Chow. Otherwise player's right draws & discards a tile to improve their hand. You get specific pts for items, 20pts for MJ. A great rummy variant game & highly recommend play as a borrow, otherwise give purchase consideration.

Even casuals have grasped the basics okay and just need a bit more time with it.

There's something about this game where the simplicity and elegance come together and captivate you in an almost magical way, or maybe its just the nice tiles LOL

I've only played on the computer and I believe thats maybe the best way to play as it requires 4 players and with that number I have hundreds of better choices. If you just wanted to play a nice relaxing game with your parents or the like though this would really fit the bill nicely.

It's 4-player rummy with tiles. I've mainly played Zung Jung, but I don't really have strong feelings about any given rule set. 

Fun and fast, especially if you have a set with arabic numerals on the Chinese character tiles (which I don't, which I regret). It's not like memorizing the Chinese symbols for 1-9 is hard, but it's another barrier to teaching new people.

Yellow Mountain Imports usually has a decent selection of reasonably priced sets. An "American Modern" set will give you some extra pieces for various rules versions and should have the arabic and Chinese numbers on the tiles.

One of the most time-tested game of all time! It is loved by many and some even believe that it helps to improve the brain and exercise it to keep it active and healthy. In many Asian countries, it's even popularly accepted as a way of gambling. I play it solely as a form of board game, just like the way i would play Chinese Chess, a favorite hobby. It is absolutely wonderful to play with, simple mechanics that can be played in various ways. No matter how one plays it, i know players just love it and can't stop from playing it over and over again. It is downright addictive, that's how good it is. Try it personally, then u will know what i mean! I personally love the three player Mahjong format, fast, unforgiving and loads of fun! Last point, just make sure u get a set of very good quality Mahjong for a wonderful fun time!

We own a 'western' set of 148 tiles.  I don't know whether I'm more enamored by the sound and feel of the tiles or the Rummy-like set collecting style of play.  We play a 'basic' traditional version (w/o jokers) using the Chinese terms 'Chow, Pung, & Kong'.  We also predetermine the number of rounds to be completed to accommodate any time constraints.  

The 4Winds PC version is an excellent stand-in when I can't find 4 players.

There are some games, that when looked at analytically, seem kinda rubbish: Only plays (well) with 4, requires a special set, full of luck, loads of rules or rules variations, arbitrary... but somehow, in this case, that adds up to really really FUN!!!

This game is definelty a guilty pleasure for me, and will hopefully see a climb up my ratings as I play it more and more. Whilst I think the aesthetics have a huge role in this, I'm perfectly happy to play it :)

Main downside to this game is you have to play with 4 - but once you have that group you can go on for hours and hours!  Essentially the best 3+ player variant of rummy I know of (the best 2 player variant is gin), with Euro-style convoluted scoring that rewards set-collection difficulty level.  Do you go for the big win, or shut down another player whom you believe is closer than you are?  Classic fun.

A truly great game but only so long as you don't add all those western rules to make the scores bigger. I hate the clean-hand-must-have-one-double way of playing, it takes away all the skill and enjoyment for me. I just play that any hand that gets you out is allowed. It doesn't mean that we have no big hands, it just means that play is much more flexible and you can change your tactic if you realise that the score you are going for is not longer possible. It also means that going out can be a strategic decision - do you hang on for that great score while risking losing laods of points to your opponent who looks able to go out very soon or do you guard yourself from losing anything by going out with a much lower score?

Love it, love it.

RATING: 3
A less strategic version of rummy with tiles. It is not much of a game as it pretty much plays itself with few if any interesting decisions. You collect sets and you don't reveal them unless you have to because keeping them in hand is worth more points. This means there is no risk to holding anything which is the main decision of interest in Rummy. Apparently the game is more interesting with betting - a slow multiplayer slot machine. Perhaps if I played with different scoring rules I would raise my rating to a 4. I can't imagine playing a full 5 hour game - that must be painful!

(A comment on my rating: there isn't really an appropriate score for this game. I have a nostalgic fondness for it, and would like to play it again one day, but probably never will, since nobody I'm likely to meet will remember how to play. So I can't rate it properly.)

Mahjong was once my preferred game, I think. The element of chance protected me against my father’s insistence on winning every game of everything he ever played - which was almost entirely limited to chess. Mahjong is a simple game full of interesting decisions in which you try to collect sets while deducing what your opponents must have, and trying to convince them that you are collecting something other than what you really are. 

It’s also a physically satisfying game, both from the heft and solidity of the tiles and the clicks and clacks that you make as you shuffle and play.

The scoring is a mess, unfortunately. Just about everyone seems to have their own house rules to simplify the scoring. I remember reading the rules that came with one of my sets and realising that I would never, ever remember all of the various combinations that would score points, or even all of the various multipliers listed. Scoring, of course, strongly influences strategy, so the 4 of you (strictly a 4-player game) must be absolutely clear on the agreements you have on how to score. Scoring is the main reason my rather luxurious copy of this game hasn’t seen the light of day for years.

It’s a long game, too, and I can’t see teaching anyone this game when there are so many others I’d like to get to the table. To tell the truth, I can’t see teaching anyone this game without a serious refresher of the rules for myself beforehand - it’s been that long.

I enjoy playing modern Japanese mahjong against others online or just random video game ROMs via the emulators, which allows a reasonable amount of hands and Dora concept to maintain interest. You don't have to play for all 4 wind rounds, because the standard length in Japanese is a "Hanchan" (East + South Round only). But Modern Japanese mahjong is the most concealing oriented style, with MANY hands reducing by 1 fan in value if revealed, some hands require full concealment like "Pinfu" (All Chows) and "Iipeikou" (double sequence). 

When I get sick of this excessive concealment orientation, I can switch to Chinese OFFICIAL mahjong, which has 81 scoring elements and generously awards hands which would only be worth 1 or 2 fan in Japanese style. Revealed "Itsu" (straight Flush 1-9) is worth 1 fan in Japanese, but 16 points in COMJ regardless. All 4 wind rounds are played with no dealer repetitions. The dealer receives exact score for same hand as a non-dealer. Of course, you don't have to abide by that and just set a time limit of maybe 1-2 hours. 
Plus, you need combos totalling 8 points or more (excluding flowers) to go out, so there is a certain amount of INTELLIGENCE required to build a suitable hand and knowing when to meld. 

Mahjong is not all luck, but I myself don't gamble either. I like Japanese mahjong mainly because it is the style which I first learnt, and I understand the scoring very thoroughly. However, Chinese Official style is much "fairer" and sometimes more interesting with a plethora of hands to win with, far more colourful than Texas Holdem Poker!

Also, the mahjong tiles have pleasant aesthetic qualities, nice to touch. I prefer the tiles which are medium sized, not the large/bulky Hong Kong tiles, but not the mini ones either (I hate that, so hard to build the walls). Shuffling noise is nice, but if too noisy, play on a vinyl/cloth card table. Try not to pay more than $US45 equivalent for a regular Chinese set, otherwise you have been ripped off. Bad thing is, if you lose one tile, you're basically screwed unless a kind supplier near you will offer tile replacements. And it's sometimes hard to find 3 other people to play with, so 2 player and 3 player mahjong are substitutes.

This game has a lot more luck than most of my Eurogames, but I occasionally take the time to play with my parents when I visit, as well as a couple other fans of the game.  I have a lot of trouble remembering the various scoring systems, but my mother is in the process of putting together a nice translation.  My parents and grandparents usually play a twelve-tile variant, where you get an imaginary wild tile to complete your winning hand.

For me, the game is all about weighing probabilities against rewards.  If I were a better player, I'd also be putting together mental maps of the other players' hands.  At least we don't play with some of the more random variants.

Mahjongg is a definitely classic. It's rummy game with exotic (chinese/japanese) flavour. I love this game, but unfortunately we don't have a regular playing group where to play it… that's a shame. Other sad thing is, that in Finland there are many Mahjongg-sets available, where the rules are very blurry. So if you need well-defined rules 'how to play mahjongg' in finnish, just send me email, I think I can help you (I've collected well-defined rules in one "book").

The quintessential Chinese gambling game that has many ways of winning.  One of my favorite games with astounding variations and combinations but playing with non Hong Kong rules really ruins it for me.  For newcomers it DOES take a long time to play but for the experienced it's a very fast paced game.  Game is made to be played with 4.

No game ending conditions, the hardcore gamblers usually play '4 circles' which means 16 rounds in about 2 to 3 hours.

It`s like rummy on steroids. The game is nice, but the rules are so complex and there are so much rule sets which have all it's different variations. The hardest part is to try to remember all the hands you can make and the score and restrictions which comes with it. And of course, these hands are different from a rule set to another.

UPDATE: The problem with mahjong is the scoring. Playing the game is pretty easy to catch. But the scoring mechanism is very complex and there are dozens and dozens of different rule set. A rule set could have between 20 and 90 scoring rules or pattern that you have to remember. Then some rule set as you to pay other players for various reasons. So unless you have an expert around the table, there is no way I could manage scoring by myself.

Some advice that I read, "If you end up checking out Mahjong, use the Zung Jung rules. Those are a modern rule set, designed by one man, who is familiar with euro games (Alan Kwan, he's on BGG, too). It's much better than the rule sets that have evolved over time and carry all sorts of historical background."

Essentially a Rummy style game with tiles and fancy designs, but a lot of fun. If it wasn't for all the wierd scoring variants (everyone has their own set of rules), I'd play it a lot more often...

In fact, while I used to rate this an "8", I think my new rating of "5" is more appropriate. It would take some persuasion (and careful negotiation of which of the many rules variants out there) to get it to hit the table.

This IS a great game. IF you play with the correct rules....
My grandparents did bring a set using Ebony and Ivory from China in the 1920s. 
I did play this when I grown up as my mother did bring this from her home (although we used a more modern set). 
When I moved to Linköping some friends of mine liked MahJong and we got to play this, quite often.
We did use Chinese followed by Japanese rules, as we understood them from the book of Eleanor Noss Whitney. 
But for some reason we stopped playing.

Going a few years ahead I discovered Mah Jong at the gamecon LinCon. And these were organised plays, with competition. They used an improved set of rules, MCT (Mahjong Competition Rules), and this made the game even better when it comes to competition. (Our version of "Japanese rules" were in parts similar, but we did not use the "8 point min for Mah Jong" rule.)

So this is a game one can play, have fun, and socialize, drinking a nice cup of tea.
Or it can be played as a sharp competitive game.

It does have some luck, as you pull tiles, but a good Mah Jong player will know how to combine their chances, so the good ones will win in the long run.

Speaking of rules, I do really dislike the "american rules". There you scored lots of points by just being lucky and getting good tiles (dragons), so not much of a skill game.

I don't usually like card games with lot of luck, neither I like to remeber complex rules: Mah Jong is guilty on both charges (how many different doubles are there ?).

However, I like the "tactile" feel of the tiles, the artwork and the possibility to win Big. I never play for money, but I once pulled off an incredible victory, that would have been worth really a lot.

All in all, I wouldn't turn down a game, but there are better games.

I play Chinese Classical a la A. D. Millington ["The Complete Book of Mah Jongg"]. 

Going Mah Jongg is 10 points only. All players pay winner, then settle with each other.

East pays / receives double, maintains title if they Mah Jongg, otherwise passes to South.

"No score" hand is one double [of 10 for MJ + etc] rather than an additional base point value.

Special limit hands are limited to a selection of ~15; "Seven Pairs" in particular is not among them.

Obviously, being Chinese Classical, basic score is for Pongs / Kongs only, terminals / honors worth more.

Various doubles apply for use of honors, clarity of suit, concealed plays, pongs only, chows only ["no score"], etc.

A traditonal Chinese game with  144 tiles. Players are attempting to collect sequences of three or triplets. Each turn, you draw a tile, then discard, or you can take one of your opponent's discards out of turn if it forms a triplet, otherwise, you can form a sequence from the discard of the opponent to the right. You score more points if you have sets from all of one suit.

It's a popular game among the Chinese, and many people are familiar with the rattling of the tiles as they are shuffled. There is luck, and many house rules. There are a few things to keep track of, but once you get the hang of it, it flows easily.

A great deal of what makes mahjong so great relates to the pageantry and the experience of playing the game, especially the sounds of clacking tiles. With less ceremony and formality, it's a gin rummy variant; but with the precise rules on building the tile walls, the distribution of the tiles, the changing of the winds, the bestowment of titles such as dragons, the elaborate scoring that varies by group, mahjong transcends its mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Although it has a reputation as an old person's game, I find that the tactile sensation of scrambling the tiles, building walls, and selecting tiles feels more substantial than other games of cardboard. 

Although the basic rules are easy to learn, it seems like it takes a lifetime of play to master.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A great family tradition. I am intrigued by the potential to aim for high-scoring hands, which never sees play in my "go out as early as possible" family.

I know that reading other players' discards is an important part of strategy, but I have never figured out how to do it.

Having played a bit more on my phone, I am astonished at how much game there is here. In particular, imposing a hard lower limit on the quality of one's hand transforms it into a game with Race-for-the-Galaxy-like strategic depth. In theory the traditional doubling scoring system should incentivise similar behaviour, but for some reason this never happens.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I've only played the simpler version of the game, so I got the impression that it has elements of both rummy and poker. Has a high luck element to it, but as with most card/tile games, that is usually balanced by playing multiple games.

RATING: 8
(I own a set of cheap mahjong cards and a set of cheap japanese tiles.)

The basic mechanics of the Mahjong are pretty simple. Basically on your turn you draw a tile and discard one. Or you can call for someones discard if you make a set. This is familiar to anyone who have played rummy family games. In mahjong the hard part is the scoring. Your gaming experience can be a very different depending on what scoring/ruleset you'll be using. Here's some of my thoughts about different rulesets I've played with.

Official Chinese competition rules:
I played my first game with official Chinese competition rules. There are quite many things to consider when forming a hand. I personally like the wide variety of hands. There are actually 81 different hands/scoring elements. The good part having this many is that usually with almost any starting hand you have something you could aim for. Naturally you should be aware of them while playing and that might slow down a game if players haven't played a lot. 

One of those rulesets you should play a lot to be able to play it casually. Scoring can give you headache. Especially since you need a hand worth of 8 points to have a legal winning hand. Because of this and the fact there are so many different scoring options this probably isn't the best ruleset to start learning Mahjong. Full game of 16 rounds can take a while if players aren't Mahjong-veterans.

Japanese Riichi (European Mahjong association Riichi) ruleset:
Playing Riichi Mahjong was a lot easier than with Chinese official rules. There are enough (38) different types of hands. There is one basic limitation, your hand must be worth 1 yaku (doubling) to be a legal winning hand. There are also few ways to get doublings that don't count for this limitation. 

The one-yaku limitation is quite relaxed but for beginners it is possible to forget it and start constructing a dead hand. Easiest way to have a winning hand is constructing any concealed hand and then declare it ready but then you cannot change the hand anymore. 

The gambling background of Riichi can be seen from the big swings there can be in scores. When you have a good hand worth few doublings you can get quite high points. On the other hand quite a few rounds will be draws where no-one will be able to get a winning hand. But even then those who are one tile away from winning will get points from those who are not. 

Overall I like the Riichi Mahjong ruleset a lot. It's probably not the easiest ruleset but easy enough for those too who haven't played a lot of Mahjong (but perhaps other rummy games) but it still has enough different hands to go after. Simple but not too much.

American style Mahjong:
I have only read the rules and played against computer opponents. I still have firm opinion that this version of mahjong isn't to my taste. Personally I just don't like the idea of Charlestons (exchange of tiles between players) at all. There might be some cleverness of play available but ... I'd rather play using a bit more conventional rules.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A game of rummy played with tiles -- three suits and some specials. A lot of fun with the right people. Use the Japanese (or Chinese) scoring. Avoid the American version -- jokers -- at all costs, as it removes any skill from the game.

This is a perfect game to play on little sleep (or as a drinking game), as the laughs will come quick and easy.

I'm not great at it, but I do like trying to pick out a hand that I can achieve and adapting when it seems like it won't work.

I've played it on the computer so much that I broke down and bought a set off of  eBay.  I've played it with the wife and kids, (though my son who is six needed some assistance from time to time).  Great game, great fun.

I often feel as though I still haven't played this to its full potential, since I've never had the pleasure of playing the entire 16 rounds, nor do I know all of the special combination hands (Plum Blossom on the Roof et al.), nor have I ever read the entirety of the rules (only a piecemeal collection of internet printoffs...).  I really love the game for the weight of history behind it, and for the artistry of the green-backed tiles (Green Dragon is my favorite!) and for the neat way that you deal out tiles using the "Great Wall" as your draw pile.

I hope someday to play it the entire way through, using the correct point values and point chips, all 16 glorious rounds!

Nothing to say about this Chinese classic that has not been said before. I usually play with my family, and rarely play with points. The enjoyment of winning a simple game is enough. There are the special hands, which I have also found out to be unnecessary to enjoy the game, even though I would really like to play with people that use them for points. I do not play the american version of the game.

I have a beautiful Japanese set that is not marred by the roman numbers and foolish American scoring system. I like introducing interested players to the more strategic Japanese rules. But alas most players in my area are grandmas playing the rules of the Mah-Jong heydey in the early 20th century.

It's really just an advanced form of rummy. But I like rummy, and as with Cribbage, the traditional terminology and tactile nature of the components add to the experience. We played Zung Jung scoring but I am prepared to hear arguments for alternatives.

Not so much a game, more a way of life. (For an afternoon/evening, that is.) Would never have caught on nowadays, as is basically glorified rummy. You need the right set, with the right feel and the right smells. I first played with parents and sister, then as a teenager with cousins, much later with wife and a couple of friends. Works well as a genteel game with lovely mystique, to be played following a good meal while sipping tea or sake or whatever.

Mahjong is a fun game, but no two people seem to agree on all the rules. We just have to argue that out up front each game.

Mine is a good sturdy set of solid tiles from China. Not fancy, but they get the job done. The Chinese numbers still take me a while though since there's no Arabic numeral in the corners.

Remember when Mahjong was fun? I don't. It's the number 1 preferred gambling game back in China as I still see this game being played to this day. My mother really loves this game and will keep making a concerting effort to master her skill level at this game. This is the pinnacle of counting tiles and counting the chances your opponent will have the correct set and suite. I respect the game but I don't see the interest and intrigue in this game. Replace the nice jade sets with just cards from a 52 card deck and you get something awfully boring and bland. I will respect the history of this game but I dont' find it interesting at all.

Sure it's essentially like gin rummy, but when you play it with the right people (and for the combos) it's a great competative game.  Gotta be careful you don't play too long, though, as it can get quite competative and tense.  And the blocks look like candy!

A rummy variant.  Canasta is as simple and more fun.  The tactile and auditory quality of playing with the tiles should not be under-estimated.  Chinese friends I have played with use a simpler scoring than the Western version I am used to, and it accentuates the luck factor.

Most rules explanations for this game are opaque and obtuse but once the formal sequence of play is explained it's quite straight forward.  Most of the complexity and variation comes in scoring, which isn't even that bad.

The game itself is pretty random.  If you count tiles, you can improve your play, and you can take some calculated risks.  So, while there are elements of skill, there isn't anything in the game that I would call 'strategy'.

RATING: N/A
I put together a custom set that has tiles for all variations of the game that I could get information on, complete with jokers, a full set of capture tiles and red 5's, as well as a few custom pieces I had made.  The tiles are the biggest I could find, and the set is huge.

Bought a large, cheap HK set... lots of fun just setting it up, and it's not a bad game to play either. Plus it's probably part of your rich cultural heritage, right?

Update: Played a heap more using fuller rules (incl. Japanese discards), bumped it up to an eight.

Update: Loving it more and more, bumped it up again. There's quite a bit of depth for such a simple game, and the more you play the faster it gets. Gotta play with the Japanese rules to keep the luck down, tho'.

Update: Eeeee! My sister gave me a nice set for xmas 2006!

Update IV: Playing a bit of riichi on the DS, and enjoying that also.

I learned the Hong Kong style of play. This game is basically gin rummy with some special matching tiles and a loose but present theme. There's no reason you couldn't play this with a Mahjong deck instead of tiles.

Rating is for playing with the World Series (or Zung Jung) rules. Knock a half point for playing with Hong Kong rules or a whole point for playing Classical rules. Mahjong is really a great family game, which was a little bit of a surprise to me. It's also a great social game to play with another couple, provided you have the time!

The shame of Mahjong is that most people in America only know Mahjong as a match two puzzle game. It's a fine puzzle, but this is sad. The actual game is quite good (it's had pretty impressive staying power, after all), and blends the set collecting elements of Rummy, the "card" (tile) counting elements of Poker, and throws in a dash of Chinese cosmology. The rules are simple enough that my four year old has started to play her own hand, and you can easily simplify the rules a little bit when playing with young children. Mahjong also offers a great deal of tactile pleasure - much more so than a card game. Clacking the tiles together as you shuffle them, building the walls, drawing the tiles and smacking them down on the table, and shouting out your Chows (runs) and Pungs (3 of a kinds) is a lot of fun.

If you are a board gamer, you should at least learn to play this classic.

Röviden römi tégladarabokkal. Hosszabban 82 féle pontszerzési lehetőség átlátása és jó párosítás, erről szól ez az ősi kínai játék. 13 kővel kezd mindenki és körében 1-et húz 1-et dob így pórbál minél hamarabb 4 darab 3-as sort vagy ugyanolyan figurát kihozni. Figyelni kell, hogy legalább 8 pontot érjen a végén a kész kéz. Lehet rabolni is a mások által lerakott köveket. Óriási szerencsefaktort a több egymás utáni játék kompenzálja. Könnyed, gyors játék. Számomra pihentető. Az biztos, hogy talán ez az a játék, amihez óriási számú lejátszott parti kell az igazán jó játékhoz. Tetszett, talán emelek is még a pontos 100 parti után.

Mahjong plays like an elegant card game.  I love the building of the wall and the discarding into the middle and the options in set collection are clever and versatile.
I've yet to find a good translation of the rules from Chinese.  I'm also beginning to doubt that there is an agreed-upon way to play, but maybe the point is to have a unique game with whoever you're playing with.
Mahjong looks to be really fun with point chips involved, however, I doubt that many (even 3 other) people would share in my interest long enough to make it through a full set of games.  Alas!

It&#039;s a good game if you play a full game because that&#039;s when the strategies and tactics come up (IMO). The only problem is that a full game (at least when I&#039;ve played it) lasts about 6 hours. If you play just a couple of rounds it&#039;s too luck based.

Recently we were given a new deck of no-brand-name Mahjong cards (kards?) with a red fish-scale pattern on the backs.  Though we've instructional books, we've yet to play the game as we don't often get four players willing to learn.  If we did, we'd invest in one of the beautiful tile sets we've admired.  As it is right now we're going to see if we can use this deck to play Mhing, as that will work with two players.

With a steep learning curve, Mahjongg might not look like everybody's game, but it sure got me hooked. Took me some time to find friends who were willing to learn the rules that seem complex. The complexity stems mainly from the fact you have to learn different winning tile combinations by heart, or you have to stare at a piece of paper all the time.
Absolutely love this game.

I have always thought of this as a card game played with wooden tiles. I half-learned to play the game on board of a boat along the Yangtze river (it sounds a bit adventurous, but it's true!) but I never finished a game.
I own two nice sets, bought from a stall in Guilin's open-air market after long negotiations ("older and cheaper", she kept on saying). They are made of bamboo and bone, contained in carved wooden boxes and vintage looking, but who knows?

Is interesting once in a while. Heavily based on memory so it doesnt really grab me that much. The ancestor of all rummy games, most likely. As rummy games emerged in SW USA and Mexico at about the time of Chinese immigration to the west. So this game deserves a place just for its impact on cards alone.

Rules are simple, the oriental atmosphere is great. Only the scoring is cumbersome, but we use a special scoring sheet for that. Do not use the american variant of the rules, which include joker tiles! Only problem is that you need 4 people to play this game.

Got our set when rummaging around my late father-in-law's stuff. Just a whole mess of tiles wrapped up in a plastic bag. He never taught my wife how to play, so I downloaded the rules and we started playing. It now resides in our games cupboard in a nice, wooden box we obtained for it. Good game, although we tend to be intimidated by the sheer number of variant scoring methods everyone else uses.

Mah-Jong (barbilla 麻將. / 麻将 Majiang [juego de la] gorrión) es un juego chino tradicional con azulejos ilustrados, con similitudes de juego a rummy. Es un juego de juego popular, pero las apuestas realmente está en juego no es en absoluto necesario tener la diversión de juego.

Los azulejos se componen de tres trajes de numeración 1-9 (puntos, números o caracteres, y de bambú, el "as" de los cuales casi siempre se ve como un pájaro), tres dragones diferentes (rojo, verde, y blanco [blanca es inusual en el sentido puede parecer como un dragón plateado, o como un cuadro, o en blanco - pensar "dragón blanco en una tormenta de nieve"), y los cuatro vientos (este, sur, oeste y norte). Hay cuatro copias de cada baldosa. Esta asciende a 136 azulejos. Además, también se pueden utilizar fichas especiales Flor, Estación, y Joker (versión americana).

Cuatro jugadores se turnan para sacar de una población (la pared), o de descartes de los otros jugadores, en un intento de formar conjuntos de secuencias numéricas (por ejemplo, 5-6-7 del mismo palo, que sólo se puede sacar de la el jugador a la izquierda, llamando "Chow"), trillizos y cuatrillizos (que se pueden extraer de los descartes fuera de su vez llamando "Pung"), los pares, y otros patrones. "Pung" tiene prioridad sobre "Chow", y "Mah Jong" tiene precedencia sobre todo (y es la única situación que uno puede llamar la "Chow" fuera de turno.) ¿Qué pasa si un solo descarte daría dos (o más !) jugadores "Mah Jong"? Precedencia va al jugador que va a reproducir a continuación en secuencia normal.

Originarios de China en el siglo 19, se presentó a los EE.UU. en la década de 1920. Ahora se juega en diferentes formas a lo largo de Asia, Europa, América del Norte, Australia y Nueva Zelanda. Aunque las reglas de juego son bastante constantes, hay una inmensa variedad de esquemas de puntuación. Unas pocas categorías generales de los conjuntos de reglas incluyen: chino clásico, viejo estilo de Hong Kong, japonés, taiwanés, occidental y América.

Mahjong is one of the few gambling games I am willing to play even without any money involved.

This game is like many other set collection games like rummy but the variation and variety is astounding. I mean mahjong experts are like poker experts...you need to know yourself and your opponents to win a hand. The expert players can foil your best attempts and even help lesser opponents win the game. That's how good mahjong is. The game is old but still retains the complexity and difficulty that I yearn for. Will likely never turn down a game of mahjong.

I love Mahjong. The heart of the game is dead simple, but it presents almost constantly interesting decisions and has a beautiful aesthetic and physicality. I would gladly play more given the opportunity. But the game has a lot of issues from a modern perspective. Rules variations are nearly infinite. It demands exactly 4 players and a 2+ hour playing time. The learning curve - even just getting around scoring, special hands, etc. for any particular variant, not to mention real strategy - is steep. I'd argue it was the first "lifestyle game," some 80+ years before that term was coined. If it were still the 1920's, Mahjong was still the hip thing to play, and I had convenient partners, I could play it every week. But it's tough to fit into a more modern gaming lifestyle.

RATING: 6
This game encountered a wave of popularity in America around 1910 till about the 30s. It suffered from an inability by clubs around the country to come to a common agreement on rules, value of hands played and of course the American version of play versus the easier Chinese version.
It is once again facing a resurgence in this 21st century, without all the club wars. Lots of books are coming out on strategy but keep it simple with the chinese way to Mah Jong.

This is a fantastic game and provides for hours of entertainment. I play with HKOS rules and it gets especially tense when you play with dead tiles and a minimum point value.

I have played a few winds with the Chinese Classical scoring and I find it to be a "simpler" game than it is with HKOS and minimum points. It is still fun but all those doubling makes it nuts with the points. I would like to try it with Chinese Official but there are just so many variants to keep up with. I like the scoring rules I was taught (HKOS) and I will probably stick with that.

2007-06-15 - I have now played at least two hundred hands of MJ with Zung Jung rules scoring. I find this to be *much* better than HKOS. See my review for more details. As well as being broader, in terms of scoring patterns, there is a greater chance for winning/losing money.

Mah-Jongg is a traditional Chinese game using illustrated tiles, with gameplay similarities to rummy. The tiles consist of three suits numbering 1-9, three different dragons, and the four winds (east, south, west, and north). There are four copies of each tile. Special flower, season, and joker tiles may also be used. Players take turns drawing from a stock (the wall), or from the other players' discards, in an attempt to form sets of numeric sequences (e.g., 5-6-7 of the same suit), triplets, quadruplets, pairs, and other patterns.

Het aloude, niet heel erg oude Mahjong.

Spelers hebben een collectie van 13 stenen en proberen deze te combineren tot een zo goed mogelijke combinatie. Iedere beurt krijgt een speler een nieuwe steen en hij mag besluiten deze te houden of meteen weg te doen. Als hij de steen houd moet hij een andere wegdoen. De buurman mag dan deze steen meteen inpikken als hij er een combinatie van kan maken.

Spel heeft een best grote geluksfactor en komt daardoor niet erg hoog in mijn lijst voor.

A 6 for the gameplay, but the looks are well worth the bonus point. Nice game if you want to be able to see: "I lost because I was unlucky" and "I won because I am good" at the same time.

Pleasantly diverting. Mah-Jongg is less of a game and more a ritualistic way to pass the time. You can devote hours to learning all the various winning combinations, but unless you can show proof none of the other players will believe you when you claim them!

I love this game. It always seems like victory is around the flip of the next tile. Fortunately, I don't live in a culture where this game is the focus of gambling activities. Because I could see myself playing this game to the poor house. (HKNS)

This is a game where I can lose every hand in the game and still want to play it again.

My husband bought me an old, 1930s edition of the game. I was surprised to find exactly how different it was from the "Mah Jongg" computer games.

The game play is lots of fun, but setup is a bit complicated. It goes faster if everyone helps. It is a bit limiting in that you have to have exactly four players. Just be sure to keep small children away from the tiles!

I'm not a good Mahjong player but I'm always keen to play so that I would have a chance to improve my skills. We don't play for big sum of money, only 20/40 cents because we hate for it to become a gambling tool as we are not into gambling. Our goal is just for the bonding between close friends.

Have played this 100's of times in my life. One of the best games ever. Unlimited replayability and so many variations / gametypes possible to change the game completely. I'm surprised this one is not in the top of the Geek rank.

To be honest, the main fun of this game comes from feeling and banging the tiles. :P Other than that, the basic strategy to winning is roughly the same from game to game, and therefore not too replayable.

To play really well at this game, one needs to memorise the tiles other players have discarded. To reach that level of expertise, one has either played too much of it, or money is involved!

Possibly one of the greatest gambling games of all time. This one brings back memories of my childhood watching my family play 'til the wee hours of the morning. Claimed part ownership of my mom's set.

A classic game that is very important in the Chinese culture.  I don't think you can grow up in a traditional household and not have been exposed to it.  A great tool to connect to one's elders socially.  It can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.  Similar to poker in that there is a lot of psychological and behavioral metagaming involved, but personally I think it has a lot more depth than the card game.  There are a wide selection of variant and scoring differences depending on location.  I don't play it any more because when money is involved, conflicts will undoubtably follow since no one like to lose, and honestly, Mah Jong isn't really fun if nothing is on the line.  So a catch-22 there.

I grew up playing this in Iceland of all places. As a result I've garnered quite a bias. I love the feel of well made Mah Jong tiles and when people talk about tactile games this is the one I think of. For me, there are few gaming things as deliriously pleasing as a closed mah jong of cardinals and winds.

Better than the computer version.  I dtill don't have this game down.  figuing out all of the conventions is a lot like bridge.  And the little old ladies that I learned from were so good they could rub their fingers over the bottoms of the tiles to see if they wanted to pick it up or not; I couldn't believe they were cheating.

I can't quite explain the ongoing allure of this for me.  Yes, I confess it's the tiles.  They put some addictive chemical in them that makes you crave them fortnightly.

Amazing artwork on all cards. Mechanics seem very solid, but some of them don't fit the theme. More cards and variety is needed at this point.

Will try to pick up all the packs, but only for the art and the storyline (for the RPG).

The lack of multiplayer fun kills the game for me at the moment.

Got my first english core set and I will never touch the german translation.

3x core

Fantastic. Lots of options even in the core box, though you'll want at least 2 and probably 3 to really fill out the options as per the usuall FFG shenanigans. The 1x core experience is VASTLY better than their other games (e.g. destiny, netrunner) because all 7 factions are present and feel balanced. Lots of space to go, as only one victory condition feels possible right now, but there are seeds for the rest. Fantastic art, great fun.

Among the deepest and strategically heaviest cards games out there. Very much an evolution of and improvement upon its ancestors (MtG, Old5R, Netrunner, GoT). 

The upside: imagine a game of MtG entirely focused on combat and exchanging combat tricks. Then add layers and layers of choices for battlefields and types of combat, and remove the bizarre and archaic stuff like the stack, priority, and mana screw. Actually, remove almost any chance for losing based solely on random variance: you always have resources and dudes you can play. The strategy of how well you deploy them and balance the resources you're given: fate, honor, and more abstractly, time, since your dudes are limited in how long they hang around based on the fate you invest in them. 

Oh yeah, and make it much, much cheaper than MtG. I say this from experience as a guy who once lugged a $3500 MtG deck around with him. 

The comparison to board games is a bit different: it's primarily a 2-player contest of wills in a way that most eurogames are not. Its ritualized card combat evokes Twilight Struggle to some degree, but with lower variance, more customizability, and similar asymmetry. 

The downside: like many of FFG's games, the starter box is not a complete game experience. Also, it has a couple rules that trigger so rarely that they are often forgotten and seem like they would be better off pared from the game to reduce already significant complexity (in particular keeper/seeker roles but also imperial favor to some degree; maybe even the stronghold bonuses).

This new incarnation of the beloved L5R as a living card game is long awaited.
It has been modernized, made more interactive, reshaped to remove snowballing victories... and much more:
- now characters survive battles on the losing side, but... die of aging!
- card draw an duels use an ingenious dial
- rings are not a win condition anymore, but play a much more integral role in the gameplay 
- holdings are no more resource generators, so there is no "mana screw"

This new L5R keeps the aesthetics and flavor of his ancestor, but declines them in a new and more friendly manner. Will it be a hit? Only time will tell... but the foundations seem very promising...

Initial Impression: Although I'm familiar with the Rokugan setting and d20 RPG, I never quite understood how this would translate into a card game. I can honestly say that I'm stunned at how well this was accomplished. Typical of FFG, the artwork for this game beautifully immerses the players into the oriental fantasy world. The gameplay, intricate even for a boardgame, gives this cardgame substance. Decisions are tough and there are many in to make in each turn. Multiple paths to victory and asymmetrical decks of faction cards round out the pleasant experience I've had so far with this game. There's so much depth to this cardgame that I want to experience every faction.

RATING: N/A
Crab - Defensive Military + Dishonor. They frequently rely on discarding their characters to gain effects, and also focus on buffs for holdings. Weak at attacking, strong at defending.
Crane - Political + pseudo honor. They rely on having their characters honored for the major of their effects, and also focus on negation and dueling. Weak to dishonor, strong at political and negation.
Dragon - Military + Political. They have balanced stats that rely on super units stacked with attachments to crush provinces and some some fate manipulation. Weak to attachment hate and board control, strong in that they balanced stats.
Lion - Military + pseudo honor. They want to swarm bodies on the board and use their conflict cards to keep characters around for multiple turns. Weak at political, strong at military
Phoenix - Military/Political + Dishonor. They control the rings and get situationally strong effects based on the element being used and high glory stats can create huge stat units. Weak to dishonor, strong stats and board control.
Scorpion - Political + Dishonor. They control the characters and get strong effects by being dishonorable. Weak low glory characters, strong at controlling the board and putting your opponent in bad situations.
Unicorn - Military. They rely heavily on doing repeated military conflicts in the same turn, readying their characters/moving them into conflicts, and being the first player. Weak to dishonor, strong at bringing unexpected amounts of people into the fight.

Crab - I'll fuck your shit up on defense
Crane - I'll boost my dudes to fuck your shit up.
Dragon - I'll fuck your shit up with a mountain of attachments.
Lion - I'll swarm you to fuck your shit up.
Phoenix - I'll manipulate game tempo to fuck your shit up
Scorpion - I'll dishonor your dudes to be useless then fuck your shit up.
Unicorn - I'll fuck your shit up with horses.

Lion=Go wide+Honor (edited as per comment below)
Crane=Win Politics+Honor
Scorpion=Win Politics+Dishonor
Crab=Turtle Defense
Unicorn=Surprise Attack
Dragon=Voltron Big Dudes with attachments
Phoenix=Conflict Manipulation

Crab:Sacrifice their own units for advantages and focus on military rather than political. They have multiple cards triggering when they are defending, punishing attackers. Stronger in defense than in offense.
Crane:Political powerhouses. They have ways to honor their characters, profit off of that and can disrupt their opponents. They also make for great duellists. Their weakness is military conflicts.
Dragon:Most current decks rely on the aptly named voltron strategy. Take one big mean dude and add equipment to him. They manipulate fate and rings to a certain degree. Their weakness is obvious:They tend to have few personalities on field, losing one hurts badly.
Lion:Military powerhouses, focusing on swarm strategies at the moment. Highly honourable their focus is on military, with political battles being their weakness. If you want lots of cheap bodies, they are your perfect choice.
Phoenix:A clan full of shugenja(mages) they have effects that manipulate the rings, giving them boni in certain conflicts. They are changing the rings, claiming a different one and so forth. Phoenix tend to favour politics but are not bad in military.
Scorpion:"Dishonorable courtiers. They use poisons, and underhanded tactics. They weaken enemy characters and disrupt the opponents playstyle. Their weakness is their relative reliance on those tricks. If the Scorpions bag of tricks is empty he isn't that powerful compared to other clans.
Unicorn:"They favour mobility and military conflicts. Unicorn decks include cards to bring people in and out of conflicts. As a tradeoff politics certainly isn't their strength.

I'm currently deciding to buy into the reboot.  I have played twice (only the two decks that can be created with one core set) and am intrigued.  Unfortunately Lion won twice (once by me and once by someone else) and I don't tend to like the Lion play style.  Looking forward to what Scorpion or Phoenix can do when I get enough cards to field them.

this is not a card game.  its a board game.  i like board games but i don't want my card games to be board games.  the framework here is so rigid and complex it leaves very little room for the cards themselves to have meaning.  in the context of a board game i would rate this much higher.

A triumphant re-imagining of a beloved classic. Refined modern mechanics push card-driven gameplay in new directions while maintaining the soul of the CCG.

This was a miss for me. I did not find the game play very interesting. It is a fiddly bloated war to increase your military or political values to break strongholds. Complicated war sums up my experience,

This is the game that burned me out on dueling card games. 
Out of my collection.

RATING: 7
It's a good looking LCG with unique style and attractive theme. However, it's too complex and long for my LCG taste and playing it felt exhausting. It wants to be more complicated than AGoT LCG or Netrunner LCG for no good reason. And that's just a core set. It will find its hardcore audience (especially from original L5R fans), but I don't think it will have a mainstream appeal. Also, it will add to the LCG market fragmentation.

The fact that you can't build a tournament-legal deck out of one starter is almost a deal-breaker.  The lack of a full rulebook in the core box would have been a dealbreaker had I known before I picked one up.

The "one $15 expansion every month" plan sounds good, but they broke that almost immediately upon launch with six $15 packs in six weeks.

Not an auspicious start.  The game itself is good - not great, not fantastic, but good, Hopefully it'll rise above the initial stumbles.

Si vous avez joué à l'ancien, vous ne serez pas perdu. C'est le même, avec quelques petites modifications de bon goût. J'ai bien aimé l'apparition des anneaux dans les conflits (politiques ou militaires). C'est une "prime à l'attaquant" qui, s'il réussit, lui apporte un petit bonus. Ca permet de pousser vers un peu d'agressivité un jeu où certains decks passifs étaient très puissants.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Té molt bona pinta, amb mecàniques originals, però em sembla que és prou complicat com per dedicarli tot el temps possible. De fet, crec que és el LCG amb més dificultad de regles que he vist (més que Netrunner, Juego de Tronos, Invasion, Star Wars, etc...). 

Això segurament serà un problema per poderlo jugar habitualment, més si tinc en compte que Juego de Tronos ja m'ocupa aquest "forat" i si que tinc gent al voltant que hi juga, o sigui que per dedicarli temps a aquest joc li hauria de treure a JdT i no se ni si així seria suficient com per profunditzar suficient en el L5R.

En resum, estaria bé probarlo però si el compro molt probablement el tindre mort de riure...

L5R LCG dethrones Magic and Netrunner from my go to constructed deck game.  I still enjoy the others, but I will always want to play this one first.  I love how the mechanical card effects operating in the rigid turn structure of the game echoes the game worlds social structure and power dynamics.  The art is beautiful.  And, the component quality is up to FFG's normally high standard.

One of the biggest disappoints of my gaming career.  I was really looking forward to L5R, and in my opinion it's the worst competitive LCG from FFG.  The fact that there is no hand size limit is absurd.  Add to that the abundant supply of 0 or 1 cost "cancel" effect cards and gameplay get ridiculous.  Not a fan.

Excellent game, excellent artwork and a not-so-excellent playtime. I joined the Launch event (got my arse handed to me by the way) and we needed almost... two hours per game? Jeezes.

All that being said I'm excited to do some deckbuilding again. To get swept up in the lore and eventually tote around a deck for every faction. Though doing so is expansive without proxies...
I'm not excited for the price point... three core sets to be competitive?! And apparently a very frequent release schedule planned.

Would've rated it higher if games didn't take as long.

FFG needed to make the new l5r both competitive & cooperative. They needed to streamline the original l5r whilst utilizing the mechanics and old school cards- instead they simplified it and scrapped all of the classic cards. Expecting people to buy three core sets just to field a competitive deck is just plain greedy and actually makes this version more expensive than the old ccg...I once put together a near unbeatable Fox Clan deck for under $40.  Incredibly dissapointing- if you want an oriental gaming fix pick up Okko, Shogun or Ghost Stories and save yourself a bundle of koku.

I own three cores.

Game feels very overwhelming in your first couple of plays. Compared to other LCGs it is the heaviest in terms of complexity. This leads to very slow rounds, but you always feel involved as you are challenged all the time.

I don't think that I like this as much as Warhammer Invasion (which I adore for its ressource/card draw mechanic) but still, I just like LCGs and in this vein the game does not disappoint.

Solid LCG. It combines a lot of familiar CCG tropes into a new and fresh package that feels different. Granted I never played Legend of the Five Rings prior to this set, so take that for what you will.

The only real knock I have against the game is that it runs just a little long for my tastes. I almost wish that you could play with 4 total provinces instead of 5. Otherwise I like the combination of deduction, resource management, and the balancing of different routes to victory. It all comes together quite well.

For me, however, I think I will stick with Game of Thrones as my go-to LCG. It runs at about the same length, and provides more variety with the decks used. The provinces used here remind me a lot of the old EVE CCG, which is one I own and enjoy, so I have those bases covered as well. There is definitely potential here though. I know it isn't quite the same game that AEG put out, but there's a lot to like with the new LCG format.

FFG keeps getting better at designing LCGs.  Three core phases to a turn each are filled with juicy decisions.  Buying characters includes an opportunity to pay more than their cost to allow them to stay around for more turns.  The draw phase involves simultaneous selection of how many cards you want to draw and the high bid must pay the low bid the difference in a victory currency.  And the combat phase eliminates the fear of using characters lest they die from other LCGs (their longevity is a function of how much you pay) AND involves selection of where the battle takes place, what type of battle it will be, and what benefit a win results in.  Simply outstanding.  The only nit is that the cards do not have multiple uses like in Star Wars, but the rich decision trees escalate this LCG to the very top.

I was so so ready to love this game, but I've gotta say that I'm initially just so/so on it. It feels fiddly, doesn't feel extremely thematic to me like Netrunner did, and I'm not sure what I think about around 90 cards needed to play in the three different decks. Also - even more of a turnoff is FFG doing 6 pack release in 6 weeks and only putting 1 copy of each card in base set.

Good. But at its core it's just another variation on my dudes vs your dudes. I think I'm just too old to dig another game about that. Some of the design choices are somewhat inelegant. Couldn't shake off he comparisons to Ashes. Yes, it's more complex and there are some bluff elements, it's LCG, so more cards and it's FFG, so it's beautiful, but they're not that far away when it comes to that infantile feeling. How long can the game feed on the whole "honor" drama?

I'd happily play L5R again borrowing a friend's deck, but after a few plays I can safely say that I feel no need to buy in myself.  
There are some interesting ideas, but overall the mechanics just feel cumbersome and inelegant.   8 games in, and we're still constantly running into weird rules questions and finding fiddly game breaking combos.

Hands down the best of the XCGs. This is because in most games of this type the meat of the game is in assembling the deck and the actual playing of the game is just seeing how it all turned out. In L5R, there is much in the assembly, but playing the game requires the skill and acumen of a shrewd poker player. Sadly, XCG's are a lifestyle unto themselves and I found myself unable to give it the time it deserves.

Done. After 25+ plays in about a month, I am upgrading this to a 10. This is such a deep system. There's lots to explore with even just the 3 core sets. I can't wait for the 6 packs in 6 weeks to start (I just hope they don't keep that pace!).

________________________________________________________
I am enamored with this game so far. It is quite a meaty, thinky, subtle game. The decision space is massive and deliciously opaque. It's highly interactive. Lots of bluffing and trying to get your opponent to over-commit themselves. The theme comes through nicely. The clans are diverse and each are fun to play.

This is a pretty poor "out-of-the-box" experience. You basically need 1 box/player to really get a grasp on if this game is for you. The decks you can make for 2-people out of one box are very poor, and not exemplary of the full experience. This is my biggest gripe with the system- it could very well turn away potential players- either through having a poor experience, or being reluctant on buying multiple boxes on the onset. 

That said, this game suits me perfectly, and I am very glad to have been introduced to this fine game. I quickly purchased my 3rd core after playing  a couple rounds of it.  Where 1 core is "very poor," 3 make this game "phenomenal." Three cores are plenty to share between 2 casual players. 

It is hard to really "see" this game from the rule book. The game looks relatively bland and simple in the Learn-to-Play guide, but once you actually play through a game or two, you really see that this is a deep and nuanced game. At first, it looks like a semi-random "take-that" game where you just keep adding and subtracting modifiers until someone wins. And indeed, your first game or three may come out like that. After you gain some skill, you notice that there are lots of tactics and opportunities surrounding those back-and-forth moments. Deciphering the proper sequence of actions is incredibly important, and you or your opponent misstepping can win or lose matches. Each choice is agonizing and multi-dimensional. Being able to read your opponent is paramount. It takes a few games for the rules and turn flow to take a back-seat, but I have still had a blast learning this system. I look forward to many years of exploring this game. I am also very fortunate to have a group of 6 enthusiastic casual players to play with. 

This is my game of the year.

I've now played enough I feel I'm getting the feel of the game down. The tempo of the game is great. In my fourth game I was down three provinces to my opponent down none and just from conservative play and waiting out the fate on his power cards I was able to knock out two provinces before he brought a massive force to bear. I even repelled a massive assault. Epic feel to this game.

Kind of has the feel of Magic: The Gathering with some added, potentially more interesting mechanics (so further plays could definitely see this move up a rating). I love it, and I'm looking forward to making a couple of beasty decks. My only issue is it does seem to get a bit convoluted at times (but I guess Magic can fall into this trap too) and I don't like the restricted deck building, even though that probably is a strength of it to stop shenanigans.

RATING: 6
AGH. This game is upsetting. I was really, really hoping to love this one and have a steady alternative to my usual favorite- Netrunner. 

But this game is just a little too complicated for a card game. While I haven't had a hard time understanding it, it feels like a chore to try and get to the table with other people.

You can definitely see all of the rules coming from a lot of their other card games, but some of those rules don't really feel intuitive, like they don't really need to be in this game. Such as the "imperial favor" and the "two battles per combat, 1 of each type", it really feels like were trying to jam as many rules as they could into one game. Essentially, it's become "FFG LCG: The LCG"

The art and production are beautiful. A lot of the individual mechanics- the inclusion of two decks, and sort of "two hands", feels amazing. The fate mechanic is AWESOME. But I can't help but feel like they added just a bit too much. In this case, less really could have been more. 

Also, the rulebook is terrible. Very bummed out about this. But I have no doubt that at the top, top levels, the game play can feel phenomenal. But it'd take quite a few games to get to that point.

I want to like this game because it's L5R, but I just don't.  Military/Political conflicts have no difference just different resource to manage.  Honor bidding for cards just doesn't work for me either.  Also can go long if one player is defensive.  It feels like too many game mechanics forced together, not fun for me.

Since the game launched, I have logged over 300 games both in my FLGSs and on the online platform, Jigoku. I have played in over 20 OP launch events and I still want to play more. Before any one says "it's easy to like this game because you beat all your opponents", no, I generally have a slightly better than 50/50 record. I play Phoenix a clan where one dishonor means your big giant expensive character just became a big giant expensive 0, and there's lots of ways to dishonor said character. So a lot of the games are uphill climbs for me..

What I love about the game is the strategy aspect of it, what have you seen, what haven't you seen? What is the clan splash, what cards are they splashing? What rings are in play, what rings do you want, and what rings does your opponent want? 

There's too much for me to explain about in this review and there are a lot of how to play already as well as videos that talk about deck building strategies and the various clans and what their themes are. 

Now lets talk about initial investment. If you want to try this out your investment cost can be $0. Go to Jigoku Online and go to the L5R discord and find a beginner a tutor and they can teach you how to play, and you can play for free there. Or if you have TTS there's a very good L5R mod. If you decide this is the game for for you and you WANT TO PLAY COMPETIVELY then here's the break down of what's available right now:
(All prices from CoolStuffInc.com they're one of my FLGS - https://www.coolstuffinc.com/p/241673

Core Set - $33.99, $36.25 after taxes (you'll need 3 so it'll be $101.97 or $108.75 after taxes) - https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/legend-of-the-five-rings-the-card-game/

Yes, if you want to be competitive you will need 3 core sets. While you can make a tournament legal 40 card decks with just 2 core sets and all the cards from the Dynasty packs, as it stands right now there is not a way for you to be competitive because you do need 3 copies of staple clan cards to be competitive (e.g. Against the Waves, Way of the Crab)

Dynasty packs - $12.79, $13.64 after taxes (there has been 6 dynasty packs , completing 1 cycle, released so far so it,s $76.74 or $81.84 after taxes) - https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/10/11/the-imperial-cycle/

Each dynasty packs has 3 copies of 20 cards for a total of 60 cards in each pack. So you'll only need 1 of each Dynasty pack. You can pick and choose which Dynasty packs to buy but eventually you will want all of them. Speaking for my self My Clan benefited most out of the first, third and last dynasty packs with cards like Isawa Kaede, Prodigy of the Waves and Kanjo District. So those were the priority packs for me, but at the same time I wanted Gaijin custom from the 4th pack that synergized very well with Talisman of the Sun in the last pack. So that became a next level priority pack for me to get. 

Clan packs - $16.99,  $18.12 after taxes (the clan pack has been announced but not released yet) - https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/15/disciples-of-the-void/

Each clan pack will contain 3 copies of 25 new cards as well as 1 copy of 3 different cards. Clan packs are different than Dynasty packs in that they focus on a specific clan. The first clan pack focuses on the Phoenix clan, though there will be cards for other clans that help that clan deal with the theme of the clan packs. While I don't think it will be critical for competitive play to get every clan pack for every clan. I think it would be beneficial so you have tools to combat that clan.

Finally lets talk about story. I am an L5R player from way back when. I started playing just before the Second Day of Thunder tournament in 1997 and I always felt that L5R was one big community driven choose your own adventure story and now with the release of the LCG the story has been reset to Pre-Scorpion Clan Coup and we are starting this journey all over again. I am very excited to see where they story will go and I am happy with where the story is now.

Overall, I highly recommend this game an I really can't wait to play it again.

Game deserves the praise it gets. With 3 core set decks I have yet to play a match that was unsatisfying. I like that you can get beaten in short term but still make a come back in the long term, which already happened to me several times. This is why I love the game length, the fate on characters mechanism and the card management. 
Each victory feels hard fought and earned. Each loss I can backtrace to strategic mistakes and tactical misplays. 
The balance of the cards felt very right and even the clans all have a shot at winning.
